Yes hi hello I‚Äôd like to know if you an instagram so I can look at more of your amazing art and concepts. Thank you~
---
---
---
I guess the community enjoys being toxic...
---
Thats called proxy camping.
---
...Yes because everything in the game files is guaranteed to be exactly as it is in the live game, as we've all learned from the teacher related things in the game files.
---
Kill/survival rates mean literally nothing. Nurse has the lowest kill rate on console, doesn‚Äôt mean she needs buffs. Plague has a very high kill rate a few months ago, doesn‚Äôt mean she needs nerfs.
---

---
As for the changes, yes he did get better Killer Instinct and better stealth, but why would you not just run Spine chill, or OoO, or any other stealth counter? Then it doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
Most High ranked players know what‚Äôs the best way too buff killers. When there are only 3 viable killers at red ranks, there is a problem. And again, over 80% of people on the forums said for him too not be touched, and they did it anyway. They don‚Äôt care about what the community thinks.
---
Indeed
---
If they body-blocked him on purpose then they fully deserve to be sold out. I'm all for Fair play but come on!üòÇ
---
I feel like console has more petty people than on pc. considering the community has been around much longer. having played on both i‚Äôve noticed console killers throw games just to shake their head and smack you all game. While it throws the game for them, back during the 20min queues it was pretty discouraging when it happens consecutively and you just want to play the game normally
---
If you can find out where this was from, please let me know! I can‚Äôt find it anywhere üòì
---
A: keep your lid on, this is a discussion not a pissing contest.
---
B: That‚Äôs my point exactly. They didn‚Äôt have Fog Whisperers, so my point was they have been making rash decisions with no data for a while now.
---
First things first, what is this "decent" build you speak of.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you mean the survivors or the killers lol
---
I feel like us Meg players always have trouble with Clauds. I swear every single one runs Urban Evasion and Sprint Burst - either that or they're scared of leaving scratch marks for the killer that's across the map to see. Do you main Meg because of cosmetics or because you got good perks on her?
---
Meg main big brain
---
But their changes were freddy looked promising in their anniversary stream. If they go back on those now then yea kinda disappointing. But Ghostface and legion post rework are decent.
---
Ill take a Freddy prinze jr
---
Ya I agree it‚Äôs ashame though. The devs really need to do something about the shit cause they even said they believe they did not intend for this to be a thing
---
I‚Äôve never seen a player list their ‚Äúaccolades‚Äù in their bio. 
---
I wonder if he does anything besides play DBD. Tough scenes. 
---
Not to mention the toxic aspect. Toxic players usually have a very small friend group or no friends at all. Interesting thing to boast about.
---
Haha, yeah. It always seems like Claudette mains don't like Meg mains and same vice-versa.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Meg was the first survivor I P3'd and then I started loving all of the cosmetics they were releasing for her so I mostly picked her based on cosmetics, but she is the only survivor I have all perks on. :)
---
Yes I am and don't call me that it's not going to make you some how right. Then technically the survivors are the campers and no you're wrong most people use the term to describe a killer that has the sole purpose of staying at the hook to prevent anyone who is not already at the hook from rescuing them where as in this case the survivors were the ones already at the hook camping meaning my sole purpose was to catch the people already trying to rescue who won't leave giving me a reason to leave the hook. If you can't understand the difference then you're half brain dead.
---
You're forgetting the permanently crouched urban evasion clauds
---
Tried bribing the entity he said he‚Äôs the one giving the blood points so I couldn‚Äôt :\
---
BBQ and chili,sloppy butcher save the best for last and infectious fright,or throwing in thanatophobia
---
Thanks, I'ma 4Head
---
Riiiiiiight. Because definitions and meanings suddenly don‚Äôt apply to you since you want to take them in a condescending manner and it hurts your feelings. 
---
I don‚Äôt care how others use it. If you fit the definition, you are the word. Rules don‚Äôt change. 
---
You still camped, which makes you a camper for that period of the game. Regardless of your feelings. 
---
See ya.
---
People expect to win every game so when they dont, they think it must be an issue with the game
---
to be clear it makes *a* survivor be an obsession. Your obsession might not actually be the person with DS
---
Have you played a game after that game that wasn‚Äôt bugged?
---
I try to be nice on my stream. I often get toxic messages from survivors though

I think we're dead meat.
---
I agree with everyone else. Your answer was literally in the patch notes, you just didn't want to think.
---
Yes.
---
They tried this back during beta, along with giving killers third person. They found that it made the game too scary for survivors, and they would usually DC when they were first caught rather than dealing with the stress of being chased.
---
Though personally, I think survivors now would be able to deal with it, since they know how the game works this time around.
---
Wasn't Leader more busted prior to rework?
---
Really? All I ever see are whiny survivors..
---
Yeah survivors in this game maybe entitled. People don't like the fact they have to earn a win. Also perks don't matter, if helps you win, thats all that counts. The survivor is a cocky shithead and a tip, don't check on your hex unless you feel like its being touched. Checking on it at the start is a good way to lose it quicker.
---
Tbh, if a survivor can kite a Killer for 5 gens, even if eventually the killer will get then, that's still survivor sided imo.
---
Personally, I think we need more killers like Spirit or such who can use their powers to Mindgame.
---
Like in Identity V, I've been playing the new hunter, Evil Reptilian. He can jump and body slam. The slam can do damage/break pallets if it hits them. Many survivors tent to double back or vault back over if you jump, so sometimes I jump then instantly slam, staying on the same side, netting a hit and leaving them in my face. We need more killers who's powers provide chase OPTIONS.

Thanatophobia is such a marginal slowdown though, you lose more time healing through it than it subtracts from all five generators combined.

PLAYED A GAME THE OTHER NIGHT AS SURVIVOR AGAINST A BABY, LEVEL 19, MICHAEL MYERS. I THINK HE MUST'VE BEEN BRAND NEW TO THE GAME, I'M A FAIRLY GOOD , STEALTHY SURVIVOR BUT MICHAEL WAS SUPER EASY TO JUKE, THINK I CAUGHT HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES WITH THE CLASSIC "CLIMB BACK THROUGH THE WINDOW AS THE KILLER CLIMBS OUT" TRICK THAT HASN'T WORKED IN MAYBE A YEAR OR SO. HE MANAGED A FEW HITS ON PEOPLE BUT ONLY ONE RESPECTFULLY NON-CAMPED HOOK VERY EARLY IN THE MATCH. I GOT THREE GENS DONE MYSELF WHILST MY TEAM KEPT MICHAEL BUSY, I SUSPECT THEY BULLIED HIM A LITTLE, AND BETWEEN US GOT ALL FIVE DONE FAIRLY EASILY. MICHAEL TRIED HARD, KEPT ROAMING THE MAP, GOT A FEW HITS AND STUCK WITH IT, WHICH I RESPECT BECAUSE BEING A KILLER IS HARD.
---
ANYWAY, THE REASON I'M HERE TO RANT IS THE LAST GEN POPS AND I'M PRETTY CLOSE TO THE DOOR SO MAKE MY WAY OVER AND START WORK PRETTY SHARPISH, I'M ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH WHEN I HEAR A SCREAM AND ONE OF MY TEAM MATES IS DOWNED. I'LL ADMIT I FELT A PANG OF PRIDE FOR BABY MICHAEL, "HE DESERVED THAT" I THOUGHT.
---
THE FUCKING SALTY, SHIITY LOSER, SURVIVOR DISCONNECTS!!!
---
BAN THE DISCONNECTORS!
---
NURTURE THE BABY KILLERS, THEY ARE OUR FUTURE.
---
buy it
---
Man, I spent some time trying to see if there was a thread already...so thank you for that link. upvote.
---
Yes and yes.
---
Why is your title and body exactly the same?
---
On that note, if you're going for an unhook and get caught, LEAD THE KILLER AWAY. They're not camping if you keep looping them around the hook, you're just an idiot
---
She's being abducted by aliens..
---
Prayer Beads + Mother Daughter Ring makes Spirit probably better than an add-onless Nurse.
---
Yeah I know, I usually don't, but it was the smaller Autohaven map and I was hoping to maybe get a quick kill out of finding someone on my totem. And what a surprise, 3 of them were on top of it. It was eight next to a gen just to make matters worse, so it was gonna be cleansed early anyways.
---
Doesn't matter if you're the best Wraith in the world, you're still going to get smashed by most rank 1 survivors. NURSE on the other hand...
---
 OINK
---
This didn't really change anything. You wouldn't need to be in shroud when you are about to get hit with DS. Maybe once in a blue moon someone will be running Head On. Any situation where you get stunned, they could just look at you and reveal you anyways.
---
I dont seem to ever get ruin in my blood web so i run lullaby. As long as you get hooks, its basically ruin. 
---
Seriously ignore dickhead survivors like these unless they actually give decent advice.
---
It hurts your palm to use the THUMBstick??
---
Wraith ain‚Äôt weak
---
you just put them in your game folder will replase all the files Look at this [https://youtu.be/41N9FhqhCYk?t=70](https://youtu.be/41N9FhqhCYk?t=70)
---
I love how this is flaired as "news"
---
Wasn't the comment I replied to just as whiny as everybody else on this game
---
I also do this for other reasons - like if I tend up with three TTV dudes in my lobby; guess who gets to live?
---
Sometimes I just randomly decide to do it, other times the survivor impressed me in some fashion, or they got really lucky in an unpredictable way (self-unhooking doesn't count, but the hatch spawning right next to the hook I'm moving towards does) or maybe even abandoned by their team repeatedly.
---
also, do add-ons for killers go away after a set amount of games?
---
Chasing a survivor for more then 6 seconds = tunnel :p
---
lol
---
Truth. I want to play some other killers, but i am rank 2 right now, so i really won't have enough time in the game to have fun with other killers that are not very good.
---
What's your opinion on Object of Obsession?
---
Nerf's a nerf, shouldn't have got it in the first place tbh.
---
yea just run OoO all the time, tell me how that works out when you run into a good Billy or Nurse. Why bring up these counters when there's a 1/16 chance of you running into him, otherwise the perk is a detriment to you if the killer is actually good.
---
Most high ranked players agree that it's gen times and a troubling loop here and there that's the issue. The idiots wanting to make killers broken don't want a balanced game. And you know what the devs ARE looking into loops, which is relevant to this topic because the first map they're looking into is Badham to coincide with Freddy and are going map to map to redesign most of them with more balanced tiles. Imagine saying they don't care what the community thinks when they're reworking one of the worst killers and starting to re-balance maps.
---
The people that want buffed killers, most of the time want a busted killer they can easily 4k with
---
How can Prayer Beads be the most single broken thing in the game when Omega Blink, Ebony Mori, Instant Heals and Keys are still in the game ?
---
They probably left the gen because they heard the phasing sound or your terror radius. All discordance does is tell you hey there's two or more on that gen. Doesn't hide your presence from them. If the yellow aura disperses before you get there than it means one or both have stopped working on the gen
---
That looks like nurse
---
Not much of a hot take, but understood. 
---
I said in an earlier message ‚Äútechnically you‚Äôre still camping, which makes you a camper, but it‚Äôs validated if the gates are open‚Äù. 
---
I didn‚Äôt use camper negatively either, OP took it as negative. We‚Äôve all camped. They‚Äôll learn one day though.
---
But the yellow aura is still there by the time I‚Äôve got there and no one is there. I notice that it goes off twice and if does they‚Äôre not there. Maybe the yellow aura says for the duration of the designated time 8/10/12 secs even if they leave? Not sure? 
---
Also, can survivors hear the woosh from anywhere on the map or does it need to be close or only in the terror radius?
---
It was an honest mistake I'm so sorry killer mains  üòî
---
Add ons are one game only
---
It is, but the problem is that people with keys become completely uncounterable. They will always get a free escape unless your running Franklins, which is a waste of a perk slot tbh. They should re add hatch grabs and make gates spawn across from each other, so it‚Äôs balanced for both sides.
---
I guess but i see more survivors is all I'm saying
---
Obviously Legion should be next, ALL of them together.
---
I think that was in the last hotfix. Supposedly.
---
Because it is heavily survivor favored at high rank gameplay unless you‚Äôre spirit or nurse. 
---
If a killer makes a mistake, he/she loses the game. Survivors have more room for error.
---
Wait hatch grabs got taken out? Wtf?
---
Charge time + speed add-ons are probably her strongest add-ons when it comes to brown, yellow and green add-ons. Just Bloody Hair Brooch ( the green add-on for charge time ) is very strong. The power recovery add-ons are also decent. The duration add-ons are useless for the most part. 
---
Her purple are very good except Dried Cherry Blossom. Yakuyoke Amulet is good in combo with Dirty Uwabaki/Bloody Hair Brooch for more map pressure and chase potential. Wakizashi Saya is good in combo with Bloody Hair Brooch for an insane chase potential ( but not very good map pressure ). Prayer Beads is broken. 
---
Mother Daughter Ring is a very strong add-on, but you need to be experienced with Spirit to use it, because you can't see the new scratch marks with this add-on. MD Ring is good in combo with Prayer Beads, Bloody Hair Brooch or Yakuyoke Amulet. Father Glasses is worthless for an ultra rare add-on.
---
It's faster if you use the palm..
---
This is what is happening to me  in  post game chat , playing against rank 4 when I just bought the game few days ago and they destroy me when I play killer and say nothing good post game chat , and when u try to secure 1 kill after the gates are opened they call you camper , while iam using very bad perks from what I seen in guides.  
---
Toxicity in this game is ...  immeasurable!
---
I expected a Spirit grab, but nope lol
---
YUPPER AND A BIG FUCK YOU TO THE DICKHEADS AT BHVR BECAUSE THEY CANT EVEN KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING AND IVE BEEN PLAYING FOR OVER A YEAR!
---
There needs to be something to give killers room for error, its completely unbalanced
---
If you‚Äôre on mobile, you need to hit the return button twice to start a new line. 
---
Just give me: 
---
‚Ä¢An actual priest
---
‚Ä¢A ship captain with a fog power
---
In light of all the massive benefits the hatch close mechanic gave killers this was the one concession they gave to survivors so EGC wasn't considered to be a straight Killer Buff 100%.  I'd let this sleeping dog lie man.  You still have a ridiculous edge with the new system.
---
I always say ''It's fine come on!'' as if they can hear me lol
---
It would not need the edition to make it viable. Less survivors would risk their lives for saves and killers would have it harder than they do now. Behaviour knows how much the community hates "second chance" perks where survivors get rewarded for screwing up. That's apparent with the Mettle of Man and DS nerfs
---
if it happens again i'd clip it or take a screenshot since ps4 can do that easy
---
**Physco**
---
At closer ranges it definitely does, as you can walk to either side an see the...twirl(?) Not move, so you'll know they're right there.
---
If it worked more like spine chill, where as it just stopped an gave a directional ping it would be better in my opinion. Maybe replace the red twirl with like a scratch mark variant in the direction of the survivor, just so long as it keeps it vague.
---
I just don't think people should be punished for being stealthy.
---
You can't hear her footsteps over gen sounds and very few gens have grass/corn around them. 
---
Plus, Spine Chill isn't a common perk in red ranks.
---
Many people seems to agree that after Omega Blink Nurse, Prayer Beads + MD Ring are the strongest thing in the game for killers.
---
Well cash grabs are okay. They‚Äôre not okay when the entire game becomes a cash grab. Obviously they made the game as a cash grab not intending it to get popular. But when it did they put effort in.
---
Lol right?! It made me laugh so I posted it thinking our community would laugh too. Instead everyone‚Äôs at each other‚Äôs throats! Am I the only one left that enjoys the game still?! I play both killer and survivor and yeah I get pissed off but I‚Äôm not cursing the BHVR‚Äôs devs!!! Cause I know when I play killer/survivor those same things go in my favor. Oh well I guess it‚Äôs nice to see people passionate about something. üòÇ
---
Definitely not underused but head on and Decisive Strike, just come out of the locker with the hatchet
---
I don't get it
---
I mean games are balanced around rank 10 gameplay. You can‚Äôt really do anything to give killers more room for error. 
---
There is a learning curve for ranking up. The higher you rank, you less mistakes you can afford, and thus the less mistakes (hopefully) you will make.
---
Well, well, well, how the turntables
---
Ik, but I've also learned peak times for swfs tend to be around 9pm. So thats when i stop playing. Its effective tbh
---
Camper itself is a negative term. If youre calling someone it, you have a very obvious intention. 
---
You cant just go "bro I called you a camper but it wasnt in a negative way just accept it", youre calling that person out. If you didnt mean anything negative bu it to begin with then why bother arguing in the first place? Just let it go.
---
&gt; It adds nothing to the chase
---
it adds nothing to a chase but it stops a lot of chases from even starting. On top of that you still have 1 addon slot left and base spirit is still very strong in chase
---
If only

My Therapist: Doctor Mole isn't real, he won't hurt you.

Doctor Mole:
---
WHY THE FUCK IS LEGION SO SHIT!!! GETTING THE ADEPT ACHIEVEMENT SEEMS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE!!!
---
The Doc accidentally slipped a finger inside Meg while grabbing her during the hatch escape. She didn't consent and it was a whole thing.
---
That awkward moment when you‚Äôre a rank 1 nurse on a smurf account and run into a team like that.
---
Oh, no spiky dildo for meg, dissapointed.
---
I'm not wrong
---
Thank you!
---
I knew Doc would go straight for Tapp the minute he shows up near the gate.  I'm actually pretty sure that he was waiting not far from the gate given how quickly showed up after I baited him.
---
From that angle it looks more like bugged out survior camera that decided to stop following the survivor before they went through the doorway, no offense it just looks that way to me.
---
Resseti: I'm sorry Mr mayor
---
Yes. Honestly every survivor who has access to BT should be running it all the time. It is very necessary for the amount of campers and tunnelers you will encounter.
---
BLOODPOINTS THO.

Because you can't post anything to r/deadbydaylight without a body and I just wanted to say the statement. It's easier to just copy and paste the title into the body than think up a whole extra paragraph that no one will read and is just an extension of what I already said in the title.

Anybody who posts salty after game chat should be banned.

It's alright, just be careful in the future.

I DROPPED DOWN FROM RANK 3 TO ALMOST RANK 5 FROM 3 DC'S IN A ROW. ONE OF THEM WAS DEFINITELY MY FAULT BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE ALL BHVR. THIS IS TOO MUCH STRESS.
---
I love bond, trust me, but damnit, I just want ruin or self care, or devour hope at least
---
Mettle of man  and after 3 hits from a killer you can hit one more time before going dying state basically unlimited borrowed time after getting hit 3 times and it‚Äôs a perk for ash: and hillbilly doesn‚Äôt use his attacks (lunge)he uses his chainsaw which doesn‚Äôt count to mom
---
It's common sense for an anxious killer who is afraid that if their victim is unhooked they won't be able to catch them again, or common sense for a killer used to playing with newer survivors. An experienced team of survivors will punish that play style heavily, and a confident killer is not regularly checking their hooks. Generally speaking.
---
After 3 hits of normal killer swings, eat the next hit for free. One shot abilities like hillbilly didn't count towards MOM
---
Lmao you can look here at the amount of times each perk has been on the shrine and when it was last one the shrine.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shrines_of_Secrets_Archive#Past_Shrines_of_Secrets
---
Fun facts for those too lazy to click it. The most ... Shrine'd:
---
Survivor perk - Calm Spirit 16 times
---
Killer perk - Enduring 15 times
---
Meanwhile 14 perks have never been on the shrine. 
---
Bond has been on the shrine 3 times in the last 9 weeks.
---
Its such a cool feature but the "its random the entity decides" thing is tired af and do you really want us to think the entity is that stupid to put Calm Spirit on the fucking shrine 16 times.
---
I have been making a shrine of secrets guide thing (ShrineWatch) on youtube for the last 49 weeks and some weeks have shattered my mind. If I was in charge of the shrine I would make sure shits balanced and even probably somehow themed... 
---
speaking of which  https://twitter.com/XolfRiggler/status/1146378596371464193
---
You know it
---
I THINK THAT IF A RANK 1 WANTS TO BRING A RANK 15 IT SHOULD GO TO THE LOWEST LEVEL PLAYER BUT IF THEY HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN COLOR THEN RANK GAINS SHOULD BE DISABLED FOR THE HIGHER LEVEL PLAYER. FOR EXAMPLE A RANK 3 COULD QUEUE WITH A RANK 8 AND IT WOULD MATCH TO THE RANK 8 BUT THE RANK 3 WOULDN'T GET ANY PIPS. MAYBE SO IT FEELS LESS UNFAIR THEY SHOULD ALSO BE PROTECTED FROM DEPIPING.
---
I'd rather have this as a toggle option incase you wanted the game to be a bit harder for you, a bit scarier too
---

There's nothing in the rules preventing someone from camping and tunneling. It happens to everyone. To assume someone is an ass because you don't agree with the way they play a game is a bit steep, just like calling immersed players braindead. 
---
So many people here have huge hangups about waaah toxic survivor this and waaah toxic killer that. It's just people and it's just a game, is it really worth getting so pissed over? 
---
The next time you get destroyed by a skilled swf, or camped to death by a leatherface (because we've all been there a lot, for both of these) just remember that's a person on the other end just playing a game and trying to win. You're good enough to move on and win the next one man.

A good solid proxy camp on an altruistic swf or a team of solos at any rank is fair game to be honest.

25% is the current version, and it doesn‚Äôt affect gen repair

---
staring directly at him without breaking his night shroud is broken, that was the issue that persisted throughout the latter half of the PTB and the first week of release.
---
Yes Spine Chill lets you know the killer is looking at you, that applies to every single killer, I'm not calling that a hard counter because he can still easily stalk you a bunch before you realize where he is. I didn't ignore it because I don't see it as an issue, and it isn't really a common high rank perk which is what we're talking about here right? Try again
---
Tell me what balanced for high ranks means outside of they can wipe the survivors with minimal effort. Nearly the entire killer cast is capable of wiping a team or at the very least killing 2 of them(which is fair if the teams are evenly matched) with the only issue being time or map management since their powers either take too long to setup, can't allow for map wide pressure, or don't cut down loops too much. For example all the stealth killers are perfectly fine, this includes Ghost Face, it just takes them too long to snowball when all gens are done in &lt;5 minutes.
---
Fuck this is sad. Enough Reddit for the day.
---
That nerf is insignificant. You know what's not insignificant? The removed the sound Ghost Face used to emit when he is in shroud. That's a significant buff.

---
&gt;The only god awful players are the ones that still complain about Ruin in 2019. If you can't repair through Ruin just stick to rank 18 with the other survivors that can't repair a gen yet.
---
I can easily repair through ruin but me being able to do it doesn't remove the fact that Ruin creates boring gameplay for survivors and using it on a strong killer is overkill.
---
They're so rare to see that the one or two times they've been used in my matches I thought it was a bug for a moment
---
YES! Awesome work.
---
The statue is holding the Rare addon Smoking Splinter which makes you become Freddy in the match if you use the offering. But the entity is giving him those splinters despite owning Freddy

Killer usually DC after being hit over the head with like 7 pallets and blinded then i send him a funny message.
---
Very nice! Thanks.
---
Claudette‚Äôs when Plagues vomit lands in their hiding place
---
well for nurse on perks, I always want to go with BBQ, discordance, ruin (or devour hope if you want a fun game), and Make Your Choice. This way when you hook survivors, you can find others far away and get mcy and/or a token of devour, along with early hook potential with discordance. For the add-ons, its really up to preference, as you will most likely get used to running a specific type. For instance, I like to use the less fatigue along with a speed blink, just because I've gotten used to those. Hope this helps
---
He's obviously a p3 Lery's who can't spell lol
---
Bruh it doesn‚Äôt even make sense lol
---
That survivor who " stood their with a thumb up their ass the entire game " likely depipped and ended the game with a paltry number of blood points. I don't call that a win.
---
Yes
---
well i bought leatherface because The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of my favorite movies and i wanted to play him, a character that i love
---
I like this
---
I'm gonna get angry at your post!
---
Cannibal. Easy to use, and has the best overall perk set in the entire game.
---
&gt; in most situations
---
There's way more greedier companies than EA.
---
You sound incredibly entitled man.  Are there any other perks that aren't even that good that you should be good enough to play though that they aren't allowed to run?  I'll share your list with all the killers so you get to play against the loadout you want every game.
---
So keep a good enough distance and you fuck the killer over. Doesn‚Äôt sound well. 
---
Also personally I really disliked It Follows. But that doesn‚Äôt deter my Judgement. I really think walking everywhere would be slow. Would the speed be around Nurse speed? If so then you‚Äôll never catch a survivor to start a chase. But nurse is basically walking.
---
Swf can destroy this killer as well. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry man this idea just isn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs cool you can look like last survivor you played but what if someone‚Äôs strictly killer main? 
---
Also there wouldn‚Äôt be cosmetics for it at all. I don‚Äôt know I just don‚Äôt see it being cool in anyway. 
---
Lastly we have no idea what IT is. We just know IT Follows. And no don‚Äôt get mixed up with IT the clown.
---
DBD is a game where there is more implied and made up rules and expectations from the community than the developers. If it wasn't for this sub Reddit I'd probably play "wrong" because I didn't read all the made up rules people cry about.
---
Like fuck me, if the game lets me do it then let it happen, if it's a problem complain to bhvr not me.
---
it is your job to learn how to counter killers as a survivor, and not just come complain on reddit. people like you are the reason freddy is as bad as he is
---
any information helps! i just need to get the timing and distance down and i‚Äôll be set for the nurse. thanks for sharing this with me.
---
**C L E N C H**
---
Yeah the aura is 8/10/12 seconds even if they leave and it‚Äôs why people say discordance gets worse as you level it up
---
Exactly bro XD I like using different perks and builds,it makes the game interesting, but when I come up against people like this, it makes me not want to run it.
---
Hag is free
---
Yikes
---
I posted what I made, thanks for the 600 free karma lmao
---
That‚Äôs why. Thank you :)
---
Tiny Doctor
---
Looks good!
---
Needs more tiddies, but she looks good.
---
I let any survivor who doesn't wiggle have the hatch. Wiggle you die. Sorry.
---
Then they're like "huah, huah, what a noob."
---
*No shit* jackass they are at the lower ranks for a reason. Good post OP.
---
And that's why they call it the God pallet.
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
It's alright, if you want to go that far for stealth, aim for his p3 mask. When he leans around a corner, a dark cloak envelops him
---
Lol facts.
---
Like real dead meat
---
As a killer, he has been `d i s o w n e d`
---
It's Billy! He comes by twice. Used the car as if it was Billy zooming down the map. Thanks for your comment.
---
*common sense*
---
Comparison pics please?
---
I like to get my wins and talk my shit.
---
"Hmm. Ah yes. Corn. Interesting"
---
"A bad game for you, is a good game for me" 
---
That right there is the Survivor mains motto  üòÇ
---
Oh so a tunneler‚Äôs arch enemy?
---
Leatherface with PWYF is crazy good
---
It's a classic in my book
---
Not even that, it had no active timer. So you'd always get a free hit once per game unless you were one hooked.
---
Or when you are gonna leave the gen and skillcheck
---
Like 12 seconds and the exit gates open once the match start if they have wake up
---
Selfcare player oof
---
Love it.
---
Top tier.
---
Is it better or worse than it used to be?
---
That's a valid criticism I didn't think of.
---
And I'd still keep the speed boost. Maybe 0.5% per stack? something like that? Numbers on that would need tweaking for sure
---
Problem is swf would ruin it. It needs to do something besides look like a survivor.
---
tbh... that pallet is pretty posible to mindgame
---
Thank you!!
---
I've had so many games like this as of late, its annoying. Worst thing us us that they still sweat so hard against low ranks and act like they are the hottest shit just for eviscerating a low rank killer.
---
Thank you :)
---
Anyway to get around the bug that causes you to not be able to heal? I've had many games now where I can't heal myself, and no one else can heal me. Do I just give up?
---
I want the palette!! This is such an awesome gift!!
---
Still lost out on a kill and lost your own blood points because of it. But hey it's alright when survivors do it to killers but you even mention something remotely close to tunneling or camping and everyone loses their minds.
---
Naw Bubba's nice to his family in the movies.
---
This is probably one of the worst suggestions I've ever seen.
---
What if there was a killer who's sight WAS based on movement
---
Like all things should be
---
Some bugs can be harder to fix than they might seem.
---
*Tears roll down face*
---
Don't come to red, Please! Stay safe bong bong
---
Having done some KYF with my friend it is insanely inconsistent. I've been able to do it halfway across the map behind a wall while hes leaning around a tree and I've had it not work while he is staring me down from 5 feet away. I've also had it pull him out when my camera has lingered in him for maybe a full second and then I've panned away. Like I'm staring 180¬∞ the other way.
---
WELCOME TO MY MINE
---
Not really anything wrong with him. He's the only killer that can 1 shot the entire team. He just uses his chainsaw in a worse way than billy so he seems like shit. Hes really not that bad if you play him enough.
---
God he would be so shit
---
Obvious troll is obvious, go make another new account
---
Oh God no. I'd stop playing killer
---
I guess I just don't feel like bhvr handles it well.
---
I can tell you the first 100 games even as nurse are difficult ones, you just got to develop that muscle memory and you will see lots of improvement. Good luck with that
---
Why? console players seem to forget mics even exist for every other game imaginable. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I ran into a random with a mic in a lobby. Usually all in party chat and couldn‚Äôt care less for the others on the team.
---
(Xbox)
---
Stay safe bong bong üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Thanks for info
---
Are Nea eyes too ugly to add?
---
Smoke weed everyday...
---
Id make a party and set it to private. Im not talking to the people who feel like they didn't play like shit.
---
My favorite is placing traps outside of windows as hag. Enjoy that scare lmao
---
Just make a party then
---
Am i? Are you have a problem with read and understand sentences =). Cause clearly i just told you "if" =)) Your brain is missing somewhere, find it and then talk to me. was i really insulted the whole LGBT community or it was just you? :)) You are such a cliche "kidult" lol.
---
ur right, never try to midngame THAT pallet jumping throw the window, or 3 gens are gonna pop up and probably will be dc time
---
Yeah, not to mention the second they spend blinding the killer is a second they could have been making distance. Taking the time to blink loses you a 4 m lead.
---
Can we have the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 theme for Bubba? That title card theme is awesome.
---
How about NO.
---
IT isn't a clown.
---
He needs it though. Not anything major, just a happy little buff.
---
Np
---
During the match owo
---
I thought I saw something about them wanting to add post game chat to consoles? May be thinking of another game tho.
---
Two janes a Dwight and a Feng.
---
For the most part it would just be a toxic thing honestly.
---
Cuz he has a fukkin attitude IMO. I personally don't like his commentary. He's toxic
---
I thought she was just crackhead lettuce
---
Thanks I just watched it and I must say that it's matches like these that make me drop team based video games altogether. That was some depressing shit to watch
---
WHY THE FUCK DO I ALWAYS GET FOUND FIRST WHEN I‚ÄôM RUNNING DELIVERANCE
---
See edited portion.
---
HAPPY FUCKING CAKE DAY!
---
Ooh, I like the sound of a 9 killer glitch
---
*feet slaps kitchen floor* "I'm gaaaayyyyy!"
---
Not all killers are made to be strong across all ranks. Not all killers are viable across all ranks.
---
I would love this
---
that means somebody was sprinting when they vaulted through.  Unless youre next to the window, you probably wont find anything there
---
Lmao
---
Welp was just poking fun so... and while instaheals can be a big help they aren‚Äôt nearly as helpful as a memento Mori.. I think it‚Äôs all fair in war though.
---
Good perk to have for the guy keeping the killer busy while the other gen-rush.
---
You can download Identity V and play this game mode
---
Still, he should be a tiny bit faster while holding the saw at full charge. Same speed as a survivor, like when Billy revs the saw before dashing.
---
Wait until the update downloads and you‚Äôll see exactly what it did...
---
Yeah I just hope it comes to this game. A lot of people do, DBD needs a breath of fresh air.
---
I mean I already bought it. Oops.. 
---
May god have mercy on my wallet if we one day get bunny feng. They could price it as high as they wanted and my wallet would not give a damn
---
That'd be funny as hell tbh

How am I supposed to know when 90% of the people will state you‚Äôre a supposed this main because you simply disagree with them.
---
Sure Memento Moris are worse. But even Instaheals are horrible. I would like both of those taken out of the game. 
---
Simple Green or Yellow mori that‚Äôs fine. But memento no.
---
Ah. They really screwed over their team mate then. I kept looking for whatever was there and their teammate was hooked within view of me so they just wasted time
---
*how bout I do anyways?*
---
omg the hag and pig eating cake together &lt;3
---
Noob question, what does PTB stand for?
---
*how about I do anyways?*
---
According to a friend Plague still crashes the game.
---
Would love to see you (or someone besides The Entity) choose the perks every week. Personally I'd love to see it go in a sort of rotation, as in picking every perk once until all of them have been picked. This would ensure every perk ends up in the shrine eventually and that it won't feel stale... but that is a lot of perks to go through.
---
Not gonna mention Mountainous William huh
---
In all honesty the thing that gets me the most is tombstone on Myers. Talk about broken. Fuck that item. Maybe take out double heal insta heals but I really don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre terrible, considering they‚Äôre usually used in chases to buy some time if anything.
---
Beg to differ on that one. 
---
Instas are an incredible crutch and can remove momentum from the killer completely. 
---
4 instas will beat an ebony mori in ranks that matter.
---
I fell you. I‚Äôve never been past rank 11 but from what I can gather ranks below green seen really toxic
---
You have more killer variety as survivor. 
---
And you see more overall variety as killer. 
---
I‚Äôd get rid of the yellow rank and replace it with low purple though. Yellows don‚Äôt even know the game well enough to cheese it.
---
*Nooooooooooooo*
---
Lmfao you have to be kidding. They buy time that‚Äôs it. And how often do u see 4 instas? Sure 4 could be really brutal for the killer, but with a momento or tombstone as I said in the next response is for all 4 survivors and can EXTREMELY quickly turn the game.
---
Bricky uploaded one for hag it I remember right. No Wraith casefile yet.
---
YOU MAKE EXCELLENT POINTS, BUT THAT WOULDN'T HELP THE PROBLEM OF THE RANK 15 STILL GETTING BOOSTED AND THE RANK 1 BULLYING A KILLER.
---
Haha. You think tombstone is a good add on. 
---
Hurr durr instas buy time. What do you think is the most valuable resource in this game? It‚Äôs time. Play a few high rank games before you try to discuss balance. 
---
How often do you legitimately see an ebony...? Green moris get even more shit on by instas. I‚Äôm purple rank survivor right now and I don‚Äôt see them.
---
Normally it shows me 60-140 ping before the match starts, and then when I'm locked in to the match it rockets to 340-400 ping and I just sit there contemplating life
---
You must‚Äôve missed my first sentence. He is slower than Billy because he‚Äôs easier to control, has an extremely useful and sought after perk at level 1, and **CAN** down multiple survivors with a single use of his power. You‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs a good idea to have a killer who can move at the same speed as survivors, instadown multiple survivors with a single use of his power, and the only penalty being a short wind up which can be lowered via addons? Thank you, next.
---
If you take a look at my steam profile, it shows your theory is wrong. üòê
---
Good cause I currently am
---
Ofc Kira. With ability to trap pallets/windows but have to Play detonating animation when triggering it. As for surv josuke should be right choice becouse of killer, thu young Joseph with some trickster perks would be awesome. Also, imagine morioh city map and mangalike skina for other survivors
---
There is also those groups of players that's actually purple / red rank who sits in the lower ranks such as yellow and green, just purely for bullying and playing around with inexperienced killers. So it doesnt really matter what rank you play at.
---
 Again, no. You already answered your question as to why. 
---
He has the highest damage potential of all killers in terms of power. With one single pop of his power he can enter all four survivors into the dying state. That is why he is slow. Just like Huntress is slow so that you can out run her before bloodlust. That is what her ranged attack is for, that‚Äôs the trade off. 
---
It‚Äôs about BALANCE. 
---
You cant just buff up a killer and not give a trade off debuff for balance. Why do you think Nurse is so slow? Because she can teleport through basically anything as long as there isn‚Äôt a dead zone. Her movement speed is significantly reduced as a form of balance and her her fatigue time is longer when using her power for the exact same reason. That‚Äôs also why the majority of her power add on have vast drawbacks as well.
---
Leatherface is granted increased movement speed when USING his chainsaw in his AOE. Even rank 1 gods have a hard time dodging this attack. Buffing it is absolute INSANITY. 
---
That‚Äôs what insta saw addons and the other movement speed buff add on are for. 
---
The answer why you can‚Äôt have these buffs is simple:
---
IT IS UNBALANCED.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA holy shit. Purple rank as well, but way to go and flex ur Dead By Daylight tank man!! That‚Äôs great! 
---
Yes they buy time, a little time, enough for 1 more hit or around 30 percent of a gen in most situations. If you‚Äôre a solo survivor with an insta heal, then that‚Äôs only going to be helping you in a chase, because even red ranks aren‚Äôt able to coordinate that well unless actually seeing someone getting chased. 
---
In a SWF insta heal can do a lot. without coordination though there‚Äôs no way it helps much at all.
---
Might as well bring a medkit
---
Really, 500 hours and you haven‚Äôt seen the toxic SWF squads with red ranks paired with a low level to go against lower ranked killers?
---
Do you play on Xbox or PS4 where SWF use coms?  It is rampant in the PC 16-20 ranks as killer.
---
Public test build.
---
Let be even more real though. Most smurfs aren't shit talking the noobs. There is a different between someone smurfing a new account up and someone who was banned and made a new account. They aren't a smurf they're the people you're referring too. Some people like to make new accounts and level them up.
---
I like it :) 
---
If you add two tiny little black dots to it, I imagine it would look like the head of a Nea funko pop.
---
yea...
---
when i had noed it was rly like it:
---
i destroyed survivors and didnt use noed or got destroyed and noed didnt helped that much
---
i only got 2 games when noed got me 4 k
---
No
---
Rank 10 is low.
---
They do it because of previous toxicity from ttv‚Äôs.
---
But doesn‚Äôt behavior do the same thing with locking characters and perks behind pay walls? I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay money to get barbecue and chili
---
I‚Äôm sorry to say but a good looper can make a 1 hit take about 2-3 minutes till they‚Äôre down. It‚Äôs not a oh they‚Äôre down in 1 second or a ew.
---
That small of a change wouldn't make him top tier.
---
Fck off, tbag and flashlight spam  are anoying, if you get downed and facecamped to death you cant even play or enjoy the game dont compare.
---
Talk about banged up.
---
Hatchets can follow you around corners and  down hallways at that ping.
---
He never downs everyone in one hit. If that happens, the survivors deserve death anyway. He usually gets maybe one person per saw attack.
---
FUCK THAT ONE SURVIVOR WHO WORKS WITH KILLER.
---
I really wanna downvote you for that :(
---
No trust me I understand that. And I try my best to get that sort of action every game, sometimes I succeed sometimes I don‚Äôt. But an insta heal can‚Äôt be used in the middle of a loop. One double back that you aren‚Äôt ready for when you go to heal and you‚Äôre dead. Like again there still needs to be opportunity for the heal, half the time a survivor is hit before even being able to use it. 
---
Also, franklins demise?! Easiest counter to an insta heal and it‚Äôs a killer perk...
---
That happened last night when we were toxic to ghost bitch too
---
NOED SHOULDNT ACTIVATE IF YOURE THE LAST MOTHERFUCKER ALIVE/THE ONLY MASOCHIST WHO DIDNT DISCONNECT. WHY AM I BEING PUNISHED WHEN OTHERS DONT WANT TO PLAY PROPERLY?
---
Hell yeah. Get his Sad Cat pfp on her shirt with the word Unlucky
---
I‚Äôve seen plenty of rank one games where all survivors went down at once. Is it maybe the survivors fault? Maybe. But there are plenty of situations where it could happen and I‚Äôve seen several in game myself, in videos from other players, and in streams. The only other killer with potential even close to that is Michael. 
---
The fact of the matter is that he CAN do this. They are the only two characters the. can activate an ability once and down all four survivors. But the difference is LF can literally get all four at once. No one else can.
---
I had a similar issue.
---
End game coapse started, I got downed, timer slows, a teammate got downed, the teammate got hooked, I'm still down, someone unhooks the hooked guy, timer speeds back up, I'm still downed.
---
I remember when I started playing this game, I thought it was unfair for survivors that their hook timer didn't stay where it was at when they got unhooked. I thought that only 3 hook stages was way too unbalanced and you should only have the timer left (like how bleeding out works).
---
I think there is only 1 thing I thought back then that I still think now: the struggle state is stupid and they should really do something about it
---
Yeah, basically
---
Are you sure ab0ut that?
---
https://youtu.be/ikJFA_tY-fs
---
Yea I‚Äôm trying to burn through my cakes right now. So I‚Äôm using killers that I don‚Äôt normally use and it‚Äôs really apparent which ones are not viable at lower ranks
---
if a killer leaves the match you dont actually depip. If a killer closes the game or pulls the plug, then you do. just rememver though, if ANY survivor DCs in any way, killer has to struggle to single pip. essentially, servers cant come soon enough
---
Kira would be pretty fun and vanilla ice could be a better wraith
---
I stand corrected.
---
You never met a Jeff? 
---
Not even a even more rare Jeff Blackmetal Jeff?
---
THATS WHY I SWEAT IT OUT WHEN THEY WERE OP BUT NOW I FEEL BAD
---
Ok, how about addressing the main concern instead of being a knob?
---
Do you think it is fun or fair for a rank 17 to go against what about be all red ranks? Do you think that makes the game healthy and encourages more users, which helps the game grow?
---
Nurse and Billy are too strong and are causing players' standards for killers to be too high when it comes to their new powers. IMO, they need to be brought down power-wise to the level of other killers and then survivors need to be nerfed accordingly to keep the game balanced
---
He can do this in red ranks too lol don‚Äôt listen to these fools. Freddy‚Äôs good if you make him good.
---
GODDAMN IT, I SPENT LIKE 20 MATCHES AS KILLER TODAY AND HAVEN'T GOTTEN CLOSE TO DOING ANYTHING IN A MATCH. I AM R20 TRASH AND HAVEN'T GOT 1 PIP YET. IT'S NOT EVEN THE SURVIVORS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW OUTLIERS (A FUCKING **R8?**) IT'S JUST MY INABILITY TO CHASE A GODDAMN THING RIGHT. EVEN R19-20 SINGLE PERK BOIS ARE ABLE TO RIDE MY ASS LIKE DONKEY GODDAMN OLLIE.
---
For me it‚Äôs always when I get an itch on my nose or forehead. Like, the second I go to do it, I always get a skillcheck. I‚Äôve even ‚Äúbaited out‚Äù skillchecks by going for it but not doing it
---
So glad I caught Ruin and BBQ on the Shrine, they are a rare sight
---
Just bought LF today for bbq and farmed ruin a while back
---
Nah, the definition of toxicity is Ochido. Dude makes the Dead Sea look like a kiddie pool
---
Well there is a huge divide in the community because the gameplay is very different. One one hand you have a small team of people all doing little tasks while avoiding danger, while the other is one person trying to manage time by applying pressure to said previous team. The gameplay is night and day. This contrasts with other games as the gameplay is mostly uniform no matter what side you are on. Also, you get to pick what side you are on, so of course you would favor the side you normally pick, just like in a fighter game, you would support fellow mains of your favorite character. This leads to 2 very different views on how the game should be changed, ones that just like in game, clash. Hopefully this rant helps understand why I think this community‚Äôs divide is so wide.
---
When i was playing survivors, killers talk to me like that all the goddamn time. A wraith who was trying to kill me but failed many time, and he finally got me and everybody killed, spam EZ post game chat. And ton of killers from the Asia area like that. I have to say it really hopeless for them. Sad life :))
---
For fun? Because it's fun to watch unique kill animations? I purely use them for fun. As you've identified there is also the benefit of not having to carry to a hook the 3rd time. 
---
What is not fun is 4 people accepting to waste 10-20 minutes of there life so a killer can get his kick out of abusing a completely unreasonable and badly designed mechanic, to down, hook once, tunnel and Mori them all one by one.
---
It needs a redesign as many parts of the game do. I would be happy using them as I have said I do. But I understand you may feel you still want more of a benefit to using it. 
---
That is why I proposed having a restriction like Devour Hope has, that you can't Mori a player that has been hooked until you have got a certain number of hooks.
---
Alternatively, it could work the way I use it. That you can only use Mori instead of hooking for the 3rd time. HOWEVER......each Mori could give the killer a small bonus. For example an incremental speed boost? Or a penalty to survivor action speed? An increase to generator regression speed? Anything? This would be much more reasonable and acceptable I think. Because the killer will be getting the opportunity for an increasing later game advantage but at the same time survivors have had a good run.
---
I love this format.
---
I looped a ghost face all game as Dwight, not even with infinite‚Äôs just good map awareness, and I got face camped because he never once gave up the chase on me, and I constantly broke him out of shroud when he went for my teammates and couldn‚Äôt mark them. Endgame chat was literally:
---
‚ÄúDwight, I fucking hate you, you fucking cunt. I hope you kill yourself because you managed to run me around all game‚Äù
---
I'd say we got pretty lucky with that! I mean it costs more than the PC version, however it's probably cheaper than buying doc and hag w their respective survivors separately
---
Post title incredibly misleading. If you‚Äôre not near an incredibly strong structure, you‚Äôre 360ing. Over half the video is you 360ing. Spinning a killer once doesn‚Äôt really mean anything. 
---
Also, most of the clips had pre-rework Decisive strike so cool I guess.
---
Possibly an unpopular opinion, but I give a gg wp no matter what happened. Killer tunneled and facecamped, survivors were super toxic, it don't matter. A simple gg can really lower everyone's tension
---
Nea and Megs are usually the ones in league with the killer.   
---
Jeffs, Claudettes, and Dwights will risk their lives to save yours.
---
Future reference, if you‚Äôre going to continue to make videos and post them on Reddit, don‚Äôt ask for someone‚Äôs thoughts if you‚Äôre going to challenge them. You will not have everyone agree with you. 
---
If you like what you made, that‚Äôs all that matters. I gave my thoughts. I was not a huge fan. I‚Äôm sure some will like it and I‚Äôm sure others will not. Some will be a lot more ‚Äúnice‚Äù, and a lot more ‚Äúrude‚Äù. Point being, be prepared for all thoughts, not ones that agree with what you want.
---
You're*
---
I‚Äôll never wiggle again
---
then that makes it perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Some things are better not knowing. Happy hunting and stay safe bing bong boy :)
---
Fair. No idea how else to get it out there though
---
i see you are a man of culture as well
---
Adding monto to that list
---
Just know the rules for posting user content and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll gain attention if people like your stuff.
---
Or when they farm off the hook without Borrowed Time. That gets me ticked off as survivor. 
---
That‚Äôs why as killer if someone farms I will knock out the saved person and leave them in the ground so the person who ‚Äúsaved‚Äù doesn‚Äôt get any points.
---
I had that happen to me in a match earlier. I did a charge attack after the breaking animation was over and scored a hit while blind.
---
Or, like...
---
You wait for a skillcheck, get one, immediately go to itch, IMMEDIATELY GET ANOTHER SKILLCHECK
---
OP doesnt play multiplayer games so he wouldnt understand.
---
Thx!
---
r/softwaregore
---
Jeff saves me with borrowed time and takes a hit after just about every time so I always make sure to help them
---
Tunneling and camping just means the killer likes you and wants to spend more time with you. It is a complement.
---
One of the bottom 3 killers easily. 
---
Gotta pay attention to doctor, pig, or cannibal.
---
Is he dabbing
---
Funnily enough I got this map after I bought that outfit and went up against a wraith with that outfit. My friend and I didn't make it.
---
Or at least give us our own text box. The fact we don‚Äôt even get one on Overwatch is infuriating. DCUO could do it. Why can‚Äôt these games?!
---
Gives a skin that fits Kate's personality more to Feng. Yep sound about right for Bhvr
---
Open hatches.

Green keys do nothing unless you put something on it.
---
Having done this, I concur. I waited out the killer until he DC'd in annoyance.
---
That's your point of view, and I respect that a lot. I am just out to have fun, 9 times out of 10, the killer will even come by say hi, and shoot the shit. The majority of bbn people that I have met, streamer or not, do not see comms or streaming that way. I don't expect killers to not camp, tunnel, or mori me every time they see me. I will keep playing with people and having fun, even with comms. I'll let them be them and be non-toxic, liw salt, all I expect is the same in return.  Which, is what happens most of the time anyway.
---
someone who focus on one survivor hook after hook, however of you play killer you will get called a tunneler or camper no matter what you do.. (go watch a twitch steam after you vs a player with ttv in their name and see what i mean)
---
hit a player twice in a row .. tunnel come back to the area where a unhooked happened  and the hooked guy never bothered to move away or heal and is sitting on a gen.... if you attack him you tunneled.
---
end game and 3 survivors salivating at the mouth around a hook to unhook and you don't move away.. camping
---
I play a lot of legion, and if I break feral frenzy after the first hit to get the second one in for the down i get called a tunneler... a lot of time they will stand there to let me get the FF hit in and expect me to go the the next target so they can go about mending and get back to generators...
---
For a solo player, it's pretty OK. Don't run it if you aren't confident in chases, though.
---
If you're a SWF lobby, though, this is one of the best perks since you're only revealing one person but everybody knows where she is.
---
If you can coordinate with the information this perk gives, and don't get instantly killed by revealing yourself to a Nurse, it's amazing.
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Danny?
---
pig is actually top 5 in rank 1 *happy oinking*
---
she does need something though... but to say sge is bottom 3... herecy
---
I know, EA is just an easy example to use. I would say Bethesda but the Fallout community is also toxic so I won't talk crap about Fallout 76
---
Great work, any chance of legion?
---
&gt;You sound incredibly entitled man. Are there any other perks that aren't even that good that you should be good enough to play though that they aren't allowed to run? I'll share your list with all the killers so you get to play against the loadout you want every game.
---
lol what
---
You can use whatever you want on any killer you would like, that doesn't remove my right to voice my opinion about something that creates **BORING** gameplay. I am **not saying you can't use it**, I am saying you **don't have to** with certain killers and facing those killers without said perks, makes the game truly enjoyable for survivors without actually leaving the killer at a disadvantage since he is strong by default. 
---
The thread was pointing out that people are tired to face Billy and Nurse, I am simply saying that I love to play against those characters since the other characters are far more dull to play against, specially if they don't have Ruin. 
---
Do you disagree that Ruin and some other possible scenarios create boring gameplay for survivors?
---
Yeah. And isn‚Äôt plague number 1...? Have you actually played rank 1 pig?
---
She stinks. Bottom line. Don‚Äôt be weird and start doing that pig thing.
---
Prayer beads are insane, but you don't have to go against them often in my experience. Nurse is more prevalent at red ranks, and the add-ons that break her are uncommons and rares. There are so many bugs and overpowered things in the game that the less frequent stuff just gets brushed over.  
---
  
---
OhTofu released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM5vTsjYqXU) yesterday showcasing why he doesn't play Nurse. I think it sums up why Nurse is currently overshadowing prayer beads spirit. In his words, "Games end up being a complete joke. You just kill everyone, and it's not really a challenge at all." This is without using add-ons, and then to prove the point he takes all his perks off as well. One game he puts on perks and Omega blink to showcase how powerful they can be, and looking at it from the perspective of the Nurse is mind boggling. He messes up several blinks and swings, and still kills all the survivors with minimal effort every game.
---
Don‚Äôt do the achievement high rank then. Wait until the reset if you really need it.
---
Use bond you filthy casual, you are actually wasting tons and tons of time just to heal yourself in a corner of the map
---
For all the bullshit, DBD certain does have its moments.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a complex system that tries to find the best ping for each player with a killer who‚Äôs rank is roughly the average of all their ranks put together. What it really does is pick a killer 3-4 ranks lower than the lowest player and lets them get run around
---
I think the outfits should be the only thing that should be payed for. Maybe for leather face they can release him for free but then have the multiple face challenge pack be purchasable. Or maybe they make cosmetics for licenses killers and all the money from these cosmetics goes to the company that owns the IP
---
Completely agree, I'm sure how I feel about him with Excalibur but they're figuring it out.
---
Hearing him at the end of Double or Nothing when Mox attacked Kenny was just perfect.
---
I like your thinking.... you are very smart never thought about that.... GIVE THIS MAN AN UPVOTE!
---
I'm laughing at how stupid this seems. How do you add more bugs on purpose? Its not a bug unless it's unintentional.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs definitely the worst
---
"one of the best perks in the game."
---
Lol
---
The title was just perfect. Actual made me laugh. I think that quite clearly sums up my experience of DBD.
---
I'd have been fine with your statement of ruin being boring.  I'd even agree with it.  But that's not what you originally said.  You labeled them as God Awful killers for using it on Billy.  That is ridiculous to label anyone as a trash player over Ruin dude.  It makes you sound like a meme not a survivor.
---
And your still gonna get flamed for it.
---
Not me. When I have a really bad game with a killer I don't usually play, and I obviously don't do good, a "gg" feels like a kick in the ladyballs because we all know it wasn't true. Maybe that's just me.
---
So much whining -\_-
---
It was in the discord. cant really be bothered to scroll that far. just go into game duscussion and ask about peanits talking about pig.
---
Also you do know that disliking pig IS crucifixion worthy, yes? just want to let you know. I'll be lenient, but i cant talk for everyone
---
Who tf is larry
---
Typical in solo survivor. 
---
Get the SWF team that storms the hook with Leatherface.
---
Worth it
---
WHERE THE HELL IS THE SCREAM ‚ÄúCHAPTER‚Äù MAP AND SURVIVOR? IM NOT SURE IF ITS BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY BUT IVE BEEN SEARCHING FOREVER FOR AN ANSWER. WHY ARE THEY CALLING IT A CHAPTER IF ITS JUST A KILLER? I WANT TO STARE AT SIDNEY‚ÄôS ASS WHILE I PLAY. WHATS THE DELAY? ITD BE SUPER SICK NEW STUFF THAT EVERYONE WOULD ENJOY.
---
I disagree, at least on PC you can just not look, you can't turn off your hearing though and I'd rather not get screamed at to kill myself for "lagswitching" or because I "tunneled", thanks though lol
---
Every Ash I‚Äôve played with is a goddamn chad and I‚Äôve played with a few Bills who‚Äôve sacrificed themselves for the rest of the team
---
Hey, you never know
---
Oh my, we need an announcer in DbD. For when someone is hooked, hit, a heal is completed, when someone dies, and when someone dc's. Lol
---
Except Billy and Nurse. One is baby easy mode and the other breaks the game.
---
Hmm. Maybe the change has something to do with the Freddy rework. Gameplay reveal is tomorrow at 2pm ET. Guess they figured it wouldn't be to much of a problem since she usually isn't considered top tier anyways. I'd have to play against her more to form an opinion on how it affects the game.
---
This list makes me laugh because my survivor mains are Jeff, Tapp, and Quentin lol

I'm new to watching dbd streamers, what do they do that's toxic vs the other streamers?
---
You think Pug only gets 700 average viewers when streaming DBD? He def varies 1600-2600, maybe 700 on a different game.
---
TODAY ON X1 SOMEONE MESSAGED ME "I'M THE KILLER COME FARM", I WENT, AND WHEN HE KILLED ME THE SAME GUY MESSAGED ME "BTW I'M NOT THE KILLER I'M JUST A VIEWER ON HIS STREAM"
---
WHEN I CHECKED HE WASNT EVEN STREAMING
---
I STOPED PLAYING AFTER THAT
---
Green rank is my favourite rank! great job!

Dont forget old Stacey Julie and Tyrone Joe.

I need to know what else the other guy said
---
Chucky has human strength but they could probably work around it really
---
STUPID QUESYION, WHEN I RING MY BELL BUT DONT CLOAK CAN THE SURVIVIORS HEAR IT?

Pug doesn't do SWF though....

They usually do their live streams on youtube, sometimes twitch but i dont know their name do link it srry

Eh, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs that bad from what I‚Äôve seen. She does kinda get a little shitty when she‚Äôs annoyed/frustrated at something but so do most people. Those portions of the stream aren‚Äôt the majority though.
---
Noob here, what does SFW mean?
---
bruh
---
My sister played her first game today. 
---
She got facecamped by a Trapped and I had to explain they could do that. 
---
She didn't play again.
---
I have totally seen the swfs you are talking about. I'm just saying I have never seen a streamer do this and in a toxic way.
---
But why? I'm sure people bought the charity case wanting to get his cosmetic. They're business, and it was a good business decision on.
---
What about making EGC start after a certain timer and requirement that there still haven't been 2 gens done after the 3rd kill has been made, so that the survivor has enough time to maybe squeeze in a gen and not have the free hatch escape option and the killer can patrol freely to look for him. And instead of the killer being able to close the hatch if the survivor was able to reach the requirement, he wouldn't be able to close it nor grab the survivor out of the hatch. What this does is actually reward the survivor for doing work and also give the killer a chance to find the survivor. And if the survivor failed to reach the requirements then the simple EGC will play out.
---
Keys could be countered with a grab. You can't grab during hatch animation anymore.

its okay, we all make mistakes.

But it honestly shows that there arent that many negative aspects to the current hatch

Usually if people spin or tea bag right in front of me without pallet dropping or flashing my light I let them live üòÇ
---
okay on xbox one after most recent update, cannot see ANY auras. no generators, no hooks, no exit gates (as killer btw)
---
As killer regardless I usually run into swf in green ranks, not AS toxic as red but still annoying nonetheless
---
Green is also the point at which most killers are starting to just become toxic and they just start using Spirit Furt + Enduring on Hillbilly or using Nurse with BBQ, NC, Ruin, NOED, etc. still a lot better than Red nonetheless

Hi mom

Ml
---
Ooolloo
---
2 more games:
---
1 - brown medkit, green flashlight, yellow flashlight
---
2 - brown medkit (i see pattern here), purple toolbox, brown toolbox
---
In my opinion it is definitely got nerfed. Before I was looting key every 3rd game. So far 20 games today - never looted a key, a lot of brown items.
---
I don‚Äôt even know what I saw or heard
---
I use keys as survivor all the time. Your logic that "no one uses keys" is not a counter to them being used... I'm not sure why you think it is..? Keys used to be countered with grabs. Keys are no longer countered with grabs. These are both factual statements, and I'm unsure what point you're trying to prove...?
---
Oh, if only . . .   
---
Could you do one of Lisa?
---
But the problem is chasing... I feel like this would hurt his chasing, as the survivors are now getting trapped, not getting chased...
---
I've done this entirely by accident as Billy.
---
I think that if they made generator repair more... interactive (?) then survivors may be happier and two gens wouldn't be gone in the first 70 seconds of a match.
---
Or nah.  I dunno.
---
Because im not playing until Saturday

Same

Gates aren't an escape...

Hatch is.
---
I try to use it more as a faster way of saying "I have more experience with this particular side." Though now I play both sides frequently, so I suppose it holds even less meaning.

it's fair to worry about compulsive buyers. but is it fair to other people who have control over themselves who want additional content, even that additional content is just cosmetics?

If there are no gens getting done and you can't get into chases, let a survivor hop off your shoulder when there is another one left, after winning with 4 generators left, it is still iridecent, 150% in with 5 gens left, 110% with 4 left, unless they have recently changed it, then you get your chase up and get that adept, rank reset is coming soon as well, so you can get it then, for now focus on grinding BP with him, or any other killer you want
---
The whole deranking issue around her was true and she even said it was to "avoid sweaty killers".
---
She did the exact thing this meme says, bully noobs with her flashlight spamming swf.
---
Agreed. It‚Äôs cheesy but has some good moments for a slasher. Definitely not as smart and snappy as Scream, but it holds its own.
---
Cause we're groovy, baby
---
Haddonfield offering and everyone has balanced landing, insta heals, and a key.
---
Because just having a key doesn‚Äôt guarantee an escape. Killer still can find the hatch, and if you spawn in with a key the killer knows you have a key. Killer can kill you before anyone else. Closing hatch also activates NOED, which completely reduces chases and gives even more of an upper hand. Do killers have other direct counters to maps, toolboxes, medkits, etc? Besides franklins, which isn‚Äôt even a direct counter, they don‚Äôt. How dare survivors equip and use an addon! It‚Äôs so unfair! Have you really had absolutely such a difficult time with the new hatch merely because you can‚Äôt get a grab? Also, you know it‚Äôs broken and you still have a window to close the hatch while they‚Äôre jumping, right? Which is almost as strong as a grab?
---
La-da-da-da-dah
---
underrated
---
You *will...*
---
; \^ )
---
Just fix range between gates and do something with billy and 2+ blink nurse after EGS. Or devs can make hatch opening speed faster(when someone die it opens without delay)
---
https://youtu.be/44dswl_IoQE check it out here too
---
Also your video doesn‚Äôt prove anything. They were using plunderers, which considerably guarantees finding an item of better rarity, thus increasing your chances of finding a green key to finding a purple or pink key.
---
But you still can't grab anymore... I'm not complaining about it. I never was. You said "keys were uncounterable before" and you were wrong. I'm sorry you were wrong, but you were. And yes, killers DO have a counter to other items, besides Franklins. Overwhelming Presence. So you're wrong again.

Love to see you drag your PC to every room or the crapper, or even remotely, when this works without doing that.

And it's a perk that a lot of people run, quite often. And actually mentioned in the OP of this thread...
---
this has me dyyying. hahahahah I  just played a match like this and was thinking, "you have got to be fucking kidding me." 
---
I appreciate the stealth but for crustsake move a little faster.
---
But killers don‚Äôt need to grab anymore because the endgame and hatch are more killer sided now. Bringing grabs back would bring back hatch standoffs, which would defy the purpose of the EGC. Also, franklins only makes them drop it and slightly damages it, but they can still go back and pick it up later. Overwhelming presence just increases the consumption, but they can just stop using the item to stop the consumption and remove the risk of losing the item. Keep going off, I guess.
---
I'm in this situation right now.
---
I‚Äôm at red ranks and I never see anyone using it. Maybe it‚Äôs a platform difference or something, but it still doesn‚Äôt absolutely guarantee you will get a key. RNG still exists.
---
Call me when there's an Ash body pillow the we can talk.
---
Actually Rhumatoid arthritis can cause such disformations
---
Because they're toxic, and the charity case is free promotion for these toxic streamers. There's a point that you need to stop promoting community members who harm your game.
---
For survivor I like to do No Mither, Resilience, Prove Thyself, and something to vary it up. Great for getting the wounded healer achievement. This is a great challenge and if you don‚Äôt mind dying it can be a lot of fun.
---
Killers it depends but Clown with Sloppy Butcher, Hex: The Third Seal, Devour Hope, and BBQ/Thanatophobia with Flask of Bleach, and Solvent Jug is a pretty ruthless build.
---
I‚Äôve seen her feel bad for killers and let them get bbq stacks/kills. Also goof around of the killer does so as well.
---
I played against her once and got trashed, her swf let me get bbq and goofed around at the gate a bit.
---
She‚Äôs not bad at all, overall.
---
What's your PC specs? I had the same experience (-ish), the checks felt sluggish @ 60 FPS, after "unlocking" it runs between 100-200 fps, which to me seems more responsive, however depending on your pc that might not be an option.
---
Your arguments are irrelevant. My point is still valid. I never said they needed to be able to grab. I simply said that they could before. You said keys couldn't be countered, and I told you the counter. I'm sorry if you've misunderstood this. I'm simply pointing out facts about the changes of the game, and you're arguing difficulty and player experience. I really don't see the correlation.
---
Unfortunately only two got away. He face camped the survivor before me...presumably for also looping, I guess.
---
How about update my pips goddamnit
---
Nothing more fun than smashing the space bar a million times.
---
Exactly. RNG exists. Which means that anyone can find anything in a chest at any time.
---
They were needed.  His detection wasn‚Äôt working as intended and the devs realized some add ons were too powerful to be balanced.
---
And notice how there is always one goal in mind when playing killer.  It‚Äôs not to kill them all within moments of the match.  It‚Äôs to give them a slight hope to escape, that‚Äôs how the emblems are balanced.  All generators can be completed and you can still get gold or iridescent gatekeeper.  You don‚Äôt need a 4K to double pip, you‚Äôre not supposed to end the match 3 minutes into it.  The lore dictates killers are meant to harvest the hopeful feelings from survivors, and the anger from themselves.  The entity is pleased if you as a killer aren‚Äôt emotionless and feel like you can take anyone down, because the thrill of the chase feeds him, and the reward you feel when you kill a survivor feeds him.  That‚Äôs why they changed Ghostface, to A) Make survivors feel like they have hope of escape against him and B) Make killers feel like they‚Äôre working hard and are skilled to get the kills they earned
---
Unless you‚Äôre running botany
---
Sorry buddy, that's asking for too much. But for real can the damn thing be udpated
---
Medkits my dewd
---
You were talking about how keys can‚Äôt be countered by grabs anymore, thus implying that you believe that is unfair and grabs should still exist. I didnt argue difficulty, I pointed out how the structure of the hatch system and the EGC collapse is heavily killer sided for the most part, and therefore your insistence upon the necessity of hatch grabs was moot and unnecessary. You don‚Äôt see the correlation because you‚Äôre not even understanding the discussion.
---
My issue with that is that survivor adepts aren't very hard at all. All survivors have to do is escape, which is done in various ways. But killers have to work their butt off to get a 4k to get their adept. Survivors' adepts aren't hard at all, while killers' are sometimes more trouble than they're worth.
---
dude you can't say this here you know this Reddit is running by lonely killer mains :eyes: be careful and they are whiny too

She‚Äôs underage and animated

me too and then they disconnect before saying it back :(

FAIR ENOUGH, WHAT RANK ARE YOU OUT OF CURUOSITY AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT NOED THOUGH?
---
I just had a game as Spirit where one survivor (Kate) I couldn't hit no matter how hard I tried. It only landed if she was vaulting. The sword kept going rihht through her. So she sat there and T bagged.

Hot Tub time machine is an underrated masterpiece

I DON'T RUN NOED ON MY KILLERS BECAUAE I DON'T LIKE IT BUT I WILL NOT FAULT OTHERS FOR IT, AND MY KILLER RANK TENDS TO HOVER AROUND 10

* failing to protect gens, get easy mode on an end game collapse. seems the game is babysitting the other side :)
---
Sounds like you're a big part of the problem
---
Do YOU not understand? What if you started a game and have to poo, what if you want to have a Lan party with a friend at their house, you can do it without dragging the whole pc. You can play at work, library, school, after working out, and it's not just dbd it's literally any game your PC has access to. I can't believe you lack so much creative thinking you can't even muster up situations you could use this solution and instead spew garbage rather than just going "huh, it's worth trying" or even "maybe I can use this one day".
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound right
---
BHVR won‚Äôt do it, they got a lot of hate from a feminist group for spirit being ‚Äúoversexualized‚Äù since she‚Äôs half naked.  The forums were spammed for weeks by bots slightly changing the same paragraphs telling the devs to remodel the spirit to be less exposed.  If they did this to feng (who is hardly more than a teenager) they‚Äôd get lots of hate and risk a higher rating or bans in some countries for oversexualizing their characters.
---
Just wait for mobile 4head
---
I believe you need to re-read our conversation. I never implied one way or the other how I felt about it. I only made a factual statement about changes in the game. It's not that I'm not understanding the discussion, it's that we're having two completely different discussions, and I never wanted to be a part of the one you're having. I only wanted to tell you that, before the change, keys could be countered by grabbing the survivor. I'm not sure what part of this you don't understand, seeing as you've not said anything about BEFORE the change, only after. You said "keys have always been uncounterable." That simply is not true.

Jakes, Jeffs, and Aces are bros

I can possibly play tonight. Dm me if you‚Äôre interested. Canada btw
---
Think it is just a bug. Both of my friends play Jane a lot, and they both just have cosmetics from the in-game store. I'll see them in the default Jane pantsuit in the lobby, but then they'd be in their respective outfits in the actual match.
---
See that‚Äôs what makes me think they did it on purpose, because same here .. once in game we see the correct clothes. So I was wondering if they potentially made that a lobby thing so killers don‚Äôt see prestige clothes &amp; lobby dodge? maybe i‚Äôm just being hopeful. üòÖ
---
This post was brought to you by rank 20
---
right !
---
I think you're just hopeful. I play Killer as well, and will see people in their prestige outfits, and any other in-game bought cosmetics in my lobbies. Trust me, it is likely just a glitch.
---
im gonna remove my colon just to prove you wrong.
---
i care. we care.

Makes sense to me
---
oh don't apologize that rambling was beautiful! loved the thoughts
---
If eliminating looping is ‚Äúgame breaking‚Äù then i guess we better get rid of the clown, the hag, the huntress, and the plague as well. And the legion, the trapper, and the doctor also can counter looping so i guess they should go too. These killers are meant to stop loops, they are meant to shake up how survivors play. They are a hard counter, deal with it.

This is so amazing!!! You did a great job!

As a killer main I'm not proud of it but I've only facecamped once it was a feng on the swamp that, props to her, ran me for all 5 gens but she must have had all pallet placements memorized because she looped me at every. Single. Pallet... like immediately had a sense of where the next one was which was frustrating. She teabagged and pointed at every pallet she dropped so it was like a 7 minute, 5 gen, 15 pallet, teabagging chase. So when she finally got back to where we started she had no pallets and I got her. It was really the 15 pallets worth of teabagging that did it for me. The other half of me was very impressed.
---
How do you see?
---
I have two very small slits I can kind of see out of but my friends are going to have to guide me around lol
---
Aw thank you!

Nope. He isn't getting any new cosmetics from what we have seen so far

Best Wraith in the world would stopm R1 survivors, unless the were INSANELY good.
---
It's mostly skill level man.
---
70/30
---
I actually do this A LOT when someone early dcs, i just find the survivors, and proceed to help votg sides farm bloodpoints before letting them just yeet out
---
I like how the dude says gg and proceeds to make fun of me for using noed and having do not disturb on.
---
Have fun and deep wound some survivors for me on they way!

I've seen this bug a lot, in my games and posted here. This happen recently? I was hoping it had been fixed.
---
I... might do a thing with this tomorrow..
---
That's a fucking hilarious find though.
---
I play killer somewhat often, but, ironically, I‚Äôm bad at chases as killer too lol
---
Not really a perk, but going in a locker hides your aura from BBQ
---
you can hover your mouse over it if it shows nothing = mori or a meme
---
Why didn't you give up chase and go for someone else?
---
While it does annoy me when I kill 3 survivors with 5 gens left and the last one gets the hatch because they for sure did not earn that shit, I don't miss hatch stand offs in the slightest and like it the way it is now.
---
correct...
---
WHY DID THAT SWF THINK IT WAS COOL THAT THEY COULD SEND ME MEAN MESSAGES AFTER THE ESCAPE NOT COOL JUST MADE ME FEEL BAD
---
why would you waste a perk slot for that since you can go into a locker?
---
!!!!! This looks so good!!!
---
I don‚Äôt really care. It‚Äôs not against the rules as far as I can tell, if I don‚Äôt like being hooked I can just leave and play another match to have fun
---
This is only a pc problem lol
---
Thank you!! I'm glad I'm finally done with it lmao
---
Loved it!! Gave me a frenzy.
---
I‚Äôm not part of the PC SJW life...you should try it. Your logic is the same as saying whores on Twitch with the cam focused on their big tits and a small portion of the screen shows a game want compliments on their hard work and creativity.
---
Will do! Hopefully I run into other dbd cosplayers üòî
---
I HATE HOW I SUCK AND CANT PLAY AGAINST WEAK KILLERS BUT I CAN PLAY AGAINST GOOD KILLERS
---
ITS EMBARRASSING
---
This is why I refuse to go for killer adepts. You have to double pip which basically requires you to handicap yourself by giving them lots of second chances. Killing all of the survivors should always be at least one or even a safety pip.
---
pfft accurate
---
Okay but hope is dope.
---
Pretty sure it's a nickname Ochido uses for Leatherface. No surprise there, really.
---
Liar.
---
Survivor main juice
---
When, thought? Im waiting
---
What‚Äôs that sound? It‚Äôs like a helicopter whirring right over us. Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh.
---
Maybe feng as the spirit in her school uniform skin? The uniform isn't sexualized at all so I think it could work pretty well.
---
Because before the chase got into the "you should probably move on" stage they finished 2 gens which if that happens before I can even hit a survivor I usually dont take the game seriously mixed with the feng making it personal with the excessive teabagging
---
There are also plenty of loops where 2-3 seconds is not enough to run it without getting hit through the pallet, so at that point what do you do? I'd rather a survivor wait by the pallet to try and get a stun than trying to loop it, even if a bad loop will get them hit anyways
---
After several days of grinding I have finally gotten the legion
---
The tricky thing about Nurse is she plays completely differently from basically every other killer. The ability to just teleport straight onto any survivor is *insane.* She basically replaces every chase-related skill with mind games. A perfectly played Nurse will win every game, even against theoretically perfect survivors, unlike literally every other killer. 
---
As for running into trees ‚Äî oh, you will. I still do sometimes. But as you practice, you'll learn what angles you can skim trees to slide around them instead of stopping, and how to charge a point blank chainsaw to down someone you're standing on instead of whacking them twice.
---
Look up Japanese foot binding.
---
How do you get to 1mil bp
---
Fuck it, if I can only get 1 instadown with that perk it served it's purpose. free momentum to do something I already do, just leave the hook
---
HEY THANKS FURRY! is Snoop Dogg also a furry? Also 50 vbucks!
---
But can it be in the tall grass?
---
New player too, I chose to be a killer so I won't get roasted by teammates. It starts out hard but it's actually pretty OK. When you spawn, look around and find the closest gen that is located on the other side of the map. Then plan a route to the closest gen to it, then the next etc. I find the survivors frequntly there.
---
My issue is losing them, especially on maps like the cornfield. I'm bad at tracking the scratch marks.
---
Blendette only
---
Best i can do is a quarter gen
---
Ty for explaining
---
You need to stay in the locker for 4 seconds
---
This is the problem with killer mains in this sub. They see anything less than a 4k a loss and then come here to whine about OP survivors. It's obnoxious.
---
You‚Äôre legit whining about a stranger you played against on a fucking videogame. Stop taking this so seriously, this isn‚Äôt bullying it‚Äôs just salt messages.
---
I now see who the type of people who run Noed are lol
---
It got better the second time me turning on sound lmao
---
Thanks for the tip!  I'll try that.  I'm also no good at tracking.  I usually try to do one survivor game and then one killer round.   Then repeat.
---
how can you not get points with Spirit?

---
Aww I wanna hug him but I don't want to get insidious camped
---
he was broken (not working as intended) there is no denying it. survivors could stare at ghostface at point blank and still be unable to break him out of stealth. the worst they did was increase the area on the screen which can break ghostface out by like 6%. literally nothing.
---
A SWF group baggin on a killer that's what it would become
---
Like I said youre all still shitty at that rank. Youre point means nothing I play solo on rank reset and get back down to purple and red relatively easy. Maybe your bad.
---
Later in the movies she was cute, but she looked like a crackhead with short hair
---
as killer main, i hate Endgame Collapse overall. i had those immersed people with 4-5 gens holding my games hostage but damn how unfair it is when they can't do even 2 gens with my ruinless butt and yet some immersed piece of shit just gets the hatch or even able to open gates if those are far enough and i chose wrong. really, that's disgusting. RNG on gates is also stupid. 
---
why couldn't they add crows for not doing objectives for over 60 seconds(including the after gates opened) and the ability to close hatch while not being able to grab?? cheesus... that literally removes the stand offs and hostage situations. why adding these stupid mechanics.
---
Even though this is meant to be a survivor skin, this would be perfect for an alternate spirit skin. The text for it would be something like:
---
*"Seeing the girl be torn to peices, the entity tied her back together once they had her in their grasp."*
---
I can‚Äôt hear diddly squat with chase music. It‚Äôs unreasonably loud and I hate it. I wish it would just stay off.
---
In case you didn't know being hooked is a big part of the game. You're not supposed to escape every match. The Killer is supposed to be stronger than the survivors and it's not supposed to be a 1v1. You quitting early because you don't like being hooked drags your whole team down. Maybe I should just play killer or play a different game like Friday the 13th. You're wasting people's time bloodpoints and fun because you value your own more than theirs.
---
Oh and by the way survivors don't even need to escape to win. 16k blood points still count as a win even if you die. Just get rank progress plus one or one pip and it doesn't matter if you escape or die. Still counts as a win.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha
---
As survivor, always go to the gen in the center of the map. I swear, some people should have Deja Vu locked into one of their perkslots instead of rank 21 perks like adrenaline
---
I‚Äôd rather have a 3k then have to look for someone for the next 10 or more minutes
---
Ahh the sweet sound of anger, is a delicacy of the finest depths of the soul. *Hanibal Lecter mouth movement.
---
Guys this dude is obviously mentally ill, it‚Äôs best to just not reply to him. Not even joking.
---
If you think Adrenaline is a free win then you‚Äôre probably not too great at playing Killer
---
It‚Äôs a decent perk for some M1 killers, but it doesn‚Äôt work on many power assisted M1 attacks so it‚Äôs still not good on all of them.
---
**Bing bongs intensify**
---
Anyone know how one gets access to the files to do this?
---
Y'know what? It genuinely does sound like they're having fun. They're able to perform very well, and take pride in that even if it's something that only matters to them. They just wish they could do that and play a different character at the same time, but feel constricted because of balance issues in the game.
---
Survivors who cleanse a hex totem in the first 30 seconds of a match because they spawned next to it should be called Registed Hex Offenders :\^)
---
Didn't see it in the patch notes.
---
Use the self resetting traps and place one at both exits early on. After that you just have to play with them a bit. Leave em on the ground so you get more hits when they get picked up. I did mine at like rank 10 and it's for sure easier then doing it in red ranks. The main issues I faced are the hatch and disconnects.
---
Hope is a great perk
---
maybe so, but that doesn't mean he's bad or wrong
---
Yeah just a while ago
---
A lot of it will just come from experience, but a few things that can expedite the process is:
---
Learn the maps and where the tiles spawn.
---
Learn the tile types (TL walls, jungle gyms, killer shack) and where their pallets and windows can spawn
---
Find some looping tutorials. There are quite a few on YouTube that explain how to most efficiently loop each tile type
---
Understand the types of mindgames each killer is capable of, because you cannot use the same looping tactics for each one, though most general tactics will still apply
---
Learn the difference between safe pallets and unsafe pallets.  It will help you recognize when you should stick around one or extend the chase to a new tile.  There may be videos up of this as well.
---
I could probably have summed this all up by saying "check out YouTube" but I was hoping to be a bit more specific about what you could search for.
---
I‚Äôm talking about early game first hooked, I don‚Äôt care about others if that‚Äôs gonna happen. Who cares it‚Äôs one match. I don‚Äôt have to suffer, I don‚Äôt have to give the people who unhook themselves a head start escape either. I lost fair and square, so I‚Äôm gonna accept it and move on.
---
Lol thats better. Also i wish there is a corrupt intervention totem version.
---
Again I said early game first hooked. Take note of that and analyze it to see my point of view.
---
&gt; Killing all of the survivors should always be at least one or even a safety pip.
---
Yea for sure its really silly to 4K and somehow depip. I get that maybe they want to encourage people not to camp or something but its def not working as intended.
---
This crap has been around for a while. happened to a friend of mine a while back. We all got out but when he got through the game doors like the video clip he fell through the cliff and back into the match and had get back out again. This was months and months ago way before end game stuff.
---

Freddy's lullaby was never directional
---
What
---
They're bad and want you to feel as bad as they do
---
Most killers aren't actually good at the game. Maybe 10% are. The rest either think they are great, or know they suck
---
and yet you all escaped still

Seems like i depends where you are . I'm on Xbox in North America and it doesn't take too long .

every survivor does this.. just urban evade away .00000000001 second they hear a heartbat

why's meg getting shit on?
---
When the minimum amount of pallets isn't reached because of the minimum distance between pallets, they overlap.

It‚Äôs the sixth highest grossing slasher film of all time and made over $125 million on a $17 million budget.

It‚Äôs a fairly well known and liked film in the horror universe.
---
I only have your word for it. Survivor main until proven not guilty!
---
I NEVER KNEW PEOPLE LOVED WAISTING THEIR OWN TIME LIKE THIS.
---
Once you keep ranking you‚Äôll notice that these perks might not help you you‚Äôll want to teach more perks.   Survivors are more skilled therefore gens will pop left and right while you spend more time chasing. 
---
Really good players can annihilate without perks or add ons, no doubt. But for awhile, ruin, enduring, spirit fury, number of perks will be better in replace of iron grasp, NOED, bitter murmur.  Though, whispers is a nice perk to have. 
---
You can play Myers while pouring bloodpoints into other killers.  
---
Dying light is a good shape perk and STBFL. Dying Light slows the game down but sometimes by the time you kill your obsession it might not even matter.  Don‚Äôt run these perks together. 
---
But playing more than one killer is also a lot of fun!  It‚Äôs cool to have your main but I suggest trying out everyone at least once. Someone might surprise you.
---
Me too. I have bought all killers except Clown and Legion this sale, and I keep getting these offerings to play as Freddy, Pig and Bubba. Such bullshit.

Start by playing survivor first so you can learn how to better play as killer.

Have fun sttabin'!

How did the person with 3k points get 3k?

Or they‚Äôre just mad to be mad but something happened in game. What was it?

Its extra hilarious to me since the two killers i main are Pig and Huntress so I constantly have to switch from a cute ‚Äú-ah!‚Äù to ‚Äú greaGAHGGRHSHAGAAAH‚Äù

Some streamers have discord servers, and theres an official dbd server too

He is mad he already got hooked lol idk i will never understand y ppl dc for the dumbest stuff.
---
She‚Äôs a Jane so I can only assume she has head on, it didn‚Äôt work, so a DC to survivor seems fitting *not*
---
Killers gotta know when to disengage. When you're playing against a survivor with 1k+ hours and knows the loops, just don't bite when they try to lead you into a huge ass loop.
---
I played a game that lasted half an hour because a Nea kept trying to loop me around the huge shed in MacMillan estate while the other survivors were hiding. If Nea had just done a gen instead of fast vaulting near me they'd have split me up and finished the gens. Instead she fucked around trying to get the bold points and got killed when the trapdoor closed.
---
I haven't played dbd in months but I immediately cracked up at this because I remember the frustration
---
Events usually have longer queue times for killer, as they typically gain the most points. Queue times also get longer with new killer releases, as most people want to play the new killer. Putting both of those together makes the queue times go from unpleasant to horrible. Now that the event is over and the Ghost Face hype has died down, things are returning to normal.
---
Because survivors are babies that will disconnect if they get caught for the smallest thing.
---
I know, I'd sometimes rage too.
---
Yeah I get that "no one rescue him just do gens" when I'm on the hook, but once there's only one left it's like generators don't exist
---
Quite possibly darn good though.
---
AAAAA

Except they would literally never let a survivor look like this. It would be before she was cut up and... turned into a killer.

Just 1 more high tier killer so we can have 5 high tier killers of Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag, and someone else
---
And then I put box of gears + jigsaw's sketch on your head and see that love wilt.
---
Ghostface works really well in higher ranks... For now
---
Freddy was the only killer that was almost unplayably bad and it still took a looong time, so it'll probably be a long while before they'd look at other bad killers.
---
God I hate entitled survivor mains, I know I have my moments as a nea main where I go ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù in my mind to the killer, but I don‚Äôt dc or tell them to off themselves
---
I just accept my death and move on, get my bp i earned
---
Besides, 99% of the time I probably deserve the death anyway
---
Yeah, to compensate for being able to close the hatch.
---
There was a double blood point event going on not too long ago. I started leveling up Legion, cause I loved them when they got released, but didn't play them while they got reworked. I didn't enjoy them anymore and started leveling up Wraith.
---
He's a killer I never really played much, but he got reworked as well, and it seemed to have done him justice when I tried it out, and now that he's leveled up...Complete &gt;:D He is now one of the killers I'd usually switch between whenever I'm online. People die left and right, he hasn't let me down
---
Discordance: lemme just step right in
---
People complain about nurse/billy popularity but should they dare buff any other kill they instantly scream OP NERF.. go figure...
---
I doubt it. Also he doesn't need a full rework since his power is not broken, a few buffs would be enough to make him viable. Like increasing his chainsaw sprint or reach. Or even reducing his charge time by a bit or lowering the slow during charge. That would make him much stronger instantly.
---
WAZZZZZUUUUUUUPPPPPPP
---
But leatherface isnt that bad. Every killer thats able to instadown is at least midtier
---
Clearly not a shirtless David player to not get in Dwight's locker.
---
Still waiting for more Meg and Kate cosmetics...
---
I feel the other way around - I feel like I'm going to let the other survivors down. While as a killer, if I suck, then the other team just wins, so they feel good.
---
I feel this. I've had so many matches where i'm looping the killer for the whole game and keeping them busy. Gens are popping but they don't care and continue to tunnel me. If I get caught then I'm camped until i die.
---
And then at the end they usually give the hatch to the person who did THE LEAST. Like, being immersed in a corner all match. All because that person "didn't loop me as hard."
---
Rewarding good gameplay amiright
---
Link?
---
Did that with the huntress and one of his buddy's came in threw a hachet at him and started the chase but out of no where the guy gets off the hook im still chasing the guy so i leave them
---
Fast forward after the round i msg the guy and we get into a party and i asked him one dude was looking in a chest when his buddy went down and hid inside a locker and just watched me stay there and the minute i left he saved his pal 
---
Some coincidence type shit yknow?

Belle Delphine is selling her bath water, maybe that's related somehow

cool story
---
It's alright just this one time, you didn't know the rules.  But if I catch you trying to survive again consider yourself reported.
---
I got it too. I forgot to read the patch notes so I wish I knew what was in it.
---
&gt;they're just choosing not to because they value winning(easily) over variety/having fun.
---
No they aren't.  I would rather play omega blink against instaheals and toolboxes than play bing bong and get shit on. A killer is fun because, newsflash; their ability to kill. Not being able to perform on a killer you like is very fun and cool. Get a clue
---
This does need to get fixed though
---
You say returned. My problem is that I never left, and I play doctor rather frequently, but still wow.
---
You joke but now if I ever get yelled at I‚Äôm gonna say idk man take it up with u/RamsayMiBoi
---
mega yikes more like
---
What‚Äôs so cute about her when she gets pallet bonked?
---
That's...not...really comparable...at all.
---
Yeah, you're right. Honestly, now that I think about it, if they just reduce the slowing down during his charge I think that'd be enough.
---
Play with speakers and a controller
---
Comedic gold right here
---
The Bing Bong is iconic, so I didn't want to get rid of that.
---
The speed out of cloak is "gone", but if you activate it as you exit stealth it's the same effect.
---
Being able to use Haste while cloaked is probably unnecessary, but I'd still like to see him move a bit faster. IMO the Windstorm Mud add-on would be appropriate as a base cloak speed.
---
They probably assume there‚Äôs a Claudette hiding in there.
---
This is not the same situation. That building has guaranteed 4 pallets IIRC. They can spawn in different locations but all locations are inside the building. 
---
What OP is talking about is the double pallets occurrence caused by pallet generating process.
---
4K D. Hope Moris with toxic Prayer Beads, because you KNOW they deserve it.
---
Yes.  Seems to have completely removed auras, too.
---
Look at her toes
---
You can always read it in the news section.
---
Looks awesome! Wish the camera work was a little better
---
You just need to learn to play more efficiently in all honesty. That's pretty much all survivor is is learning efficient play. When to go for unhooks, how to loop, when to gen rush, etc. Like a lot of people see ruin and go hunting for it, imo it's fun to hunt down hex perks but it's really not efficient. If you can hit the great skill checks consistently it's by far faster to work through it especially depending on the map.
---
Nurse is probably the next killer devs are going to rework if any.
---
Idk the mask is already pretty round and I spent a while staring at it so the shape is pretty close, but thank you! It was my first time making a mask like that and was a lot of fun :]
---
thank you üíïüíï i edited the photos like that because i was self conscious about how it looked lol
---
But they get a default 200% movement speed. that would be crazy honestly people would actually be scared
---
Did they change adrenaline recently? I use it but haven't looked at it for a while. I get free wins?
---
Dude EGC is a buff to killers in general.  Once you close the hatch they're dead.  I close the hatch in 4/5 games.  Like let them have this one mechanic.  In every other way EGC is in our favor.  You can't cherry pick the only good thing about the old terrible overall system while taking advantage of every benefit we killers have with the new system.  Just leave well enough alone man.  We have it very very good with the new system.
---
You have a source on that? The only thing I can find japanese are related to foot binding is, that they made it illegal in the chinese parts they conquered in the past.
---
That‚Äôs has nothing to do with dead hard. It‚Äôs a current bug in the game where you can do anything or even escape.
---
I tried to upgrade Tinkerer for Hillbilly. Reached level 50, never saw it on the web at all
---
This is way too powerful and will never happen, ever.
---
It‚Äôs cool if you can literally teleport or dash across the whole map but running in a circle around a car is where we have to draw the line.
---
why?
---
I know. My point is that a useful perk like dead hard is now unusable thanks to the amazing state the game's in. Devs are fixing audio issues left and right, but major game breaking bugs are just meh, not important.
---
Just play Ghost face, he can sneak up on them and can attack without needing to uncloak.
---
Wear good headphones. It gets easier the more you play, and playing survivor as well helps. Keep in mind that if the survivors are not on the generators early on, it doesn't really matter where they are. You don't have to care. Don't waste time hunting for random people hiding, focus on patrolling generators. Later in the game finding survivors is largely about understanding what they are probably doing at any given time. You hook a survivor and there are two left alive; once you are experienced, you will likely have a vague idea of which generators the two unhooked survivors are working on, and the route that they will likely take to come rescue their friend.

Removed - Bandwagon meme

Have you tried it tho? Unless you have like 100% volume you can't hear them on console. dbd bugs are atrocious on console

I think the dev's themselves have said that 2-3 kills is the ideal avg. A 4k is possible, but it should be difficult to get it, you're not entitled to it.

This is a massive buff compared to what he was, but he'd still probably only be in B tier.
---
Huh. Well I suppose that‚Äôd be fine too. If anything, I‚Äôm not too sure I can be talkin change when I‚Äôm a rank 10 killer lol. Good idea tho. I‚Äôd like to go against this new Wraith lmao
---
Aww.. don't worry i think originals were good too tho.. but I guess the major problem was the lack of good lighting
---
The cosplay itself is rad!
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be in the game, yes, but maybe just leave and don‚Äôt wait till the killer hits you because you wanted too teabag. The killer hitting you is what causes this bug, so don‚Äôt get hit and leave.
---
This bug is back and getting killers stuck in pallets is back as well.
---
I avoided him for the most part
---
Dosen't back ache after a while or something?
---
From what I can tell there is a bug in the pallet spawning that happens when the minimum pallets have been placed, so it adds another in the best spot it can, like in Jungle Gyms. I have luckily never had this happen on either killer or survivor, but I pity those who do.
---
There is not really much point in saving them as you will get the same amount of BP, unless you expect farming games.
---
Am I missing something, healing self takes 32 seconds, getting healed by someone takes 16 from two survivors, so it's so to speak 32 seconds of no doing gen progress as well. On top of that, you have to find another survivor too.
---
Items are toxic my dude
---
What rank was he? Because if he was below rank 15 it would make sense tbh xD. Any other rank is just unacceptable.
---
Such as?
---
I don;t like NOED either. MYC is can be deadly on Nurse, Devou Hope is great too, but there's a risk that the totem goes down. If you're using another totem like ruin etc Haunted Ground is also good. If Haunted gets destroyed you should probably slug.
---
That's great advice, thank you!  I play at night with the sound very low so using headphones is probably a great idea.  Plus, if I'm the killer, there really shouldn't be any jump scares.
---
F
---
Well that was the only way she was going to get out probably. If she was playing with low ranked survivors, then they wouldn't have been able to loop you like she could. She knows her strength and role and needs to handle it.
---
OMG yes, fuck pig.
---
Thanks to this pic, i can know relate her original skin to how she looked back then, thank you.
---
I always had difficulty to see the former school girl from her ghostly appearance, now it make a lot more sense !
---
Doctor then legion
---
Honestly, You are fucking entitled. Just because YOU suck and get hooked straight away doesnt give you a freepass to shit on everybody else and dc/give up. Get better at the game. Dont run around trying to be the next noob3, play a little immersed for once.
---
And only a shitload of people had to die first
---
Unlike legion
---
Still you did great job; I would never do such a thing like that. *standind ovation* 
---
Next time I want to see THE PLAG :}
---
This is so beautiful. "Dr. Heeheeman Carter" is too much for me
---
**i see**
---
Normally I'd agree, but in this context it was just stretching the game out too long. She should have seen I wasn't biting, and should have gone done gens. She would have likely made it out if she did that while I hunted the other survivors.
---
Legion... Annoys me too much.
---
Guess what, you can‚Äôt fucking stop me. **i literally do nothing wrong when this shit happens. Now fuck off. I do what I want within reason and no matter what the fuck you say, this is within reason.**
---
So say we all.
---
At least the game would be optimized.
---
Thank you sm! Oh God I'd love to cosplay her but she seems so difficult üò≠ one day I'll get to her when I have the time
---
Assemble the killer council we shalt seal his fate
---
It's Miguel! Great work!
---
You know ever since I've got Quentin I started to use Pharmacy and it really feels better as a "healing perk" than Self Care
---
I am big pp
---
Definitely Pig. That mask is the worst lol
---
I personally find Freddy very annoying to play against right now and am very happy he's getting reworked
---
I mean its not like legion is strong but healing yourself from deepwound over and over again is just annoxing af. Also i hate how he/she looks. Just some random guys wearing hoodies
---
I went to 2 places to get it untrapped and none of them worked...
---
Thank you! The shading on the bottom hand isn‚Äôt the best but I did the best I could and I‚Äôm pretty happy with it!
---
Your grammar sucks and you‚Äôre gay.
---
Wait do we have to prestige if we don't get the perks we desire? Like right now I can't find spirit fury in my pigs bloodweb and she's level 50. Do I have to prestige her?
---
finding someone else won't be a sweat since you're already running bond, run dead hard along with bond so you can still loop even when injured.
---
-&gt; 16 seconds can be extremely important in some situations
---
-&gt; with bond you get a lot of situational awareness: Should I go get my hooked teammate, or is someone else? Where are my teammates doing a generator, I don't want to lead the killer to them? ...
---
You mean KYF?
---
Them kids wearing hoodies roaming the streets at night.
---
When I prestiged my Huntress to P3 and at around lvl 30 the game just wanted me to get tier 2 Tinkerer for her since it appeared like 10 times in a row. Decided to finally buy it and it disappeared
---
I guess I don't mind him too much, unless I get one tapped by him.
---
No. I recommend just getting p3 on every character you play a lot though, then you don't have to worry about losing anything if you want to prestige later.
---
You only went to two boxes?
---
Yep, I had a team to un-hook as well :P
---
Yeah you definitely should be cause that is really good üëå. I have a friend that makes paintings and did an amazing Miguel.
---
Nearly half of this sub is obnoxious.
---
Most of these discussion come up because of the hatch.
---
Killers complaining because they only got a 3k just because the survivor escaped through the hatch.
---
Survivors complaining because they died because the killer closed the hatch.
---
The hatch as it is, is totally fine.
---
Whoever finds it first will most likely win this 1 vs 1 situation. 
---
If the survivor finds it first the survivor will escape.
---
If the killer finds it first the killer gains a big advantage over the last survivor.
---
If the hatch opens you are in a 1 vs. 1 scenario.
---
Ofcourse the killer will have the advantage now because the normal balancing resolves around 4 vs 1 and not 1 vs 1. So if the survivor wins its a clutch escape now and if the killer wins it's just the expected outcome and both sides deserve their win in this 1 vs. 1 scenario.
---
The survivor beats the odds and the killer worked his way to this point by killing 3 other people beforehand so whoever on complains about the other side having an unfair advantage is just, like you already said, obnoxious.
---
I'd rather get a hit. Clown is the perfect example why getting pallets quickly doesn't really help that much. He gets pallets really quickly, but doesn't get hits and if a team is somehowo decent gens are just done too quick.
---
Killing yourself on the first hook because you died first isn't losing fair and square. It's denying the killer more Chaser points. The killer needs to get a minimum of 10 hooks to double pip. Or get a merciless victory. Also your team will be down to three people to do five generators and you are denying them unhook points. You are denying them on Heal Points. You are wasting their items and offerings because 1 hook means you're automatically going to die apparently. Even though you have two more chances to escape.
---
You can do it. I believe in ya! If the Plague is too difficult - that is the most horrible cosplay to make; It should take even days to prepare - try the Pig. The easiest - except Legion - female character to cosplay. 
---
Anyway, good luck with making cosplays! :)
---
Hahahhhaahha i hope next one is a bad shrine
---
Oh I gotcha. Was there more than two boxes? Or did you just not have time?
---
I assume she has a hatchet in her pocket as a special form of decisive strike, simply find a locker and gain a single hatchet, but you can‚Äôt hide in lockers as a result perhaps (there have been stupider ideas in the game from what I recall but they is fun, maybe instead of inability to hide in lockers she just can‚Äôt sprint as fast as any other survivor?)
---
Being a trapper main and have achieved all 131 achievements, I might be able to help
---
What you need?
---
**Perks**: Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel (both help in keeping generators down and prolong the game) BBQ&amp;C (to find survivors) and Bamboozle (helps in shortening the loops) 
---
You can replace Pop goes.. with Brutal Strength if you think looping is a bigger weakness for you than guarding gens
---
**Addons**: Iridescent Stone (they enable a trap automatically every 30 seconds) so you wont have to waste down time picking n setting traps again n again. Also it helps in giving false security to survs that trap is disabled when it can enable itself any second. 
---
Second addon I suggest is purple bag to start n carry three traps.
---
**Offering**: Blood Warden because this build is slightly dependent on your totem, so we need to save our stone.
---
Ok now we start and hope totem is at decent spot which can be secured with one trap. We make our way to it and secure it, but on our way make sure to trap any good spot you can find, keep it grassy or keep it adjacent to windows for map like lerrys and the meat plant.
---
Keep patrolling and trapping until you find one and get them down. BBQ&amp;C will take care of others from there. Also, keep an eye on totem trap if it gets snapped by a surv run for your totem and hunt the guy trying to break the totem. Trap will take care of itself.
---
Also keep survs on a loose leash, as chaser emblem requires you to prolong the game as much as possible, feel free to switch your prey immediately after hitting one. This will help in keeping chaser emblem from getting any negative points as well as helps in multiplying them.
---
Panic
---
Oh that‚Äôs cool! This is my first ever fanart of a DbD/horror character and I think it turned out pretty well!
---
Hag and Trapper. The unsuspecting traps scare the hell out of me lol
---
Very nice! Do you play DBD?
---
What‚Äôs p3?
---
Literally had it happen tonight against Clown. I ran back in and out again and it worked.
---
Yup! I‚Äôve been playing since January so I‚Äôm kinda newish but I‚Äôve watched youtubers play it since it‚Äôs release
---
Hag is the worse, camping on the hooks is the worse.
---
I thought in their stream they said something about changing the way his chainsaw works? Making it work more or less like Billy‚Äôs chainsaw
---
Genuine question, why do you want a battlepass?
---
Having to transition from the dream state is a pain. Immediately getting swiped after transitioning is annoying, too. The fact that he's invisible ... ugh.
---
Fantastic game isn't it? I have been playing for about two and half years and still love it. If you do another one you should do the the Wraith. Absolutely love playing as him.
---
my source is a japanese
---
Yeah I think there were 5 boxes but I had two survivors on the urge of dying :/ and the other survivor wasn't helpful.
---
I essentially spawn with 2 or even 1 hook left instead of 3 and I‚Äôm weakened already with no benefits. That‚Äôs how early I die without doing jackshit to jeopardize myself because I can‚Äôt even do anything to alert the killer I existed there yet (aka either the killer spawns too close and Lady Luck sends them my way despite the other ways being covered in gen fails, or a random other survivor drags them to me as a scape goat and I never get rescued half the time anyway, so even if I make it I‚Äôm down one or maybe even 2 fucking hooks, I‚Äôm not staying during those matches you can die for all I care, I got matches to have fun in, enjoy!)
---
Can't escape death.  A beautiful ending to a round with a lot of emotions.
---
Okay then mr camper, what would be a good reason for you not to camp?
---
Prayer beads spirit is actually the devil
---
Yeah it‚Äôs so much fun! I love going against The Wraith too! He‚Äôs so sneaky! This Michael one took me a few days to finish but I‚Äôll get right on it for the wraith once I come back from vacation!
---
That's the worst when you can't get any help.
---
It be the people who get unhooked setting off the traps and then I lose points for unsafe hook.
---
Let me tell you this, not in asia.... All green ranks have is tunneling, facecamping, survivors not even trying to unhook when its finally safe....
---
That's not a good one
---
Uh well, he/she was probably new to the game.
---
That will be freaking awesome! Me and my buddy are going to absolutely love it!
---
How the fuck are survivors supposed to survive then????
---
Not in game, only by using the party chat function.
---
I don't mind clown but doctor can be annoying if controlled by a good player.
---
Removed - Oversaturated Content, Shaming others

Even if not in dbd, that just sounds like a fun ass concept to play against.

I really hate how almost no one here understands how the plague works (and there is a vaccine for it it's just not normally used because plagues are supposed to be pretty rare since we have antibiotics and better hygiene and germ theory: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00041848.htm ) and that it's still around today: https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/health/plague-survivors/index.html
---
It's ok to not know things. It just since to be a common misunderstanding on this site.
---
But playing prayerbeads spirit is super fun you get free plucks from gens if you do well or you get to watch survivors have mini heart attacks if you miss either way its hilarious

I know right, I wish we could see at least a little bit of him.

Rework moris into being able to be used only when a large amounts of crutch perks so SFW's bringing map offerings (Haddonfield, Ormond) and looping it over could be punished by a ebony.
---
Oh thank you kind sir I will change it
---
Was learning a new killer some guy would constantly tee bag me, ended up getting him and putting him on a hook and he instantly rage quit
---
Ah, that's unfortunate
---
That's because vocal/text communication isn't intended to be in this game.

I certainly did. :( trying to get myself back up.

I think Face Campers are just thinking of better excuses to face camp, because that's all they're good at it.

Do you plan on doing more of these for the other killers?
---
Always take the risk! Sure, it could be Haunted Grounds.... But it could also be 1000 BP!
---
I sure hope so! It really depends on the references I can find! The licensed killers are of course a lot easier to find pictures of so I might start out with them and then go from there!
---
If he was, what would his fursona be?
---
Hmm...
---
Looping is actually quite fine in my opinion, I just don‚Äôt understand why loops that have no mindgames exist. It removes all joy of a chase, the moment a survivor hits a safe pallet. All I can do is loop them 4 times then get stunned, break it and resume chase. Big gaye. And every map usually spawns with like 3, and when I see one, I go, ‚ÄúWell I either get rid of this now and they do 1-2 gens, 3 if I‚Äôm really unlucky, or I can abandon this chase and get stuck at another safe loop. Yay.‚Äù
---
Adrenaline is good if you can keep killer busy and can survive chases for a few minutes. Or if you don't afraid to be injured. 
---
Sprint burst for me is the worst of exhaustion perk because it slows you down considerably, or if you want to be somewhere in a hurry, you sprint and when the killer comes you have no exhaustion perk to use. Good for immersed people with urban evasion, but if you want to be good at the game, you need to get chased.
---
Instead of self care run Bond, it's a lot more useful as you can see what other people are doing, who's getting chased, who's going for unhooks etc. You know if you can finish the gen, or if you should go for unhook. And you will get heals from your team.
---
Unbreakable for me is completely useless perk. I know on PC red rank nurses slug all the time, but on PS4 I never get to use it, not once, and I never am in a situation where it would be useful. Yea, when it works it's great, but you get epic play from this perk maybe once every 50 games.
---
Borrowed time is 50/50 perk, same as unbreakable, can give you some epic plays, can stay unused for 5-8 games in a row. If killer is smart he won't fall into it's trap, unless he is complete tunneling ahole.
---
The exact same thing happened to my friend yesterday
---
The exact same thing happened me except everyone except me escaped. I just got to wander outside the map.
---
Ah yes because you can't dodge a chainsaw and SUPER POWERED KILLERS POWERED BY A LITERAL GOD are not supposed to be op

Meg in creative mode terrorises a killer in survival mode

The Lullaby stays the same, just the terror radius goes down when the survivors fall asleep

Yeah but that side isn't present in the meme.
---
I really really think that BHVR is doing a good job in general with the game, they really care about their playerbase and they are working to fix bugs, balance the game and adding new content to the game. The state of the game usually gets better each patch (with just a few exceptions but they were usually fixed later). 
---
However they seem to be to afraid to release strong killers (as long as they arent over Hillbilly is stronger (and they arent cheesy exploitable) they should be totally fine. It seems like they jump to soon to a conclusion after a new killer is released. It takes time to see if a new killer is strong or not. They usually start with a higher winrate because its easier to learn to play as a new killer than to play against them (because as a survivor you need to figure out what the killer can do and how to counter that and as the killer you 'only' need to figure out what you can do.
---
And it usually starts out like this:
---
 - Killer gets released on PTB
---
 - Mixed reaction between to op and to weak
---
 - Buff the killer
---
 - Release the killer
---
 - Reaction: To op (and a few who say ok and to weak)
---
 - Killer gets nerfed
---
 - Time gets by: Killer to weak --&gt; gets buffed
---
Now here is my problem with this: The PTB is theoretically open for everyone, however most times only the "hardcore" players of the game will bother to play the PTB the casual players sometimes dont even really notice. These hardcore players usually have a deeper understanding of the game and its mechanics than the casual players so they tend to figure out how to play against new stuff alot easier.
---
However: Most of the community are the casual players. And they usually need a bit more time to figure out how to play against new stuff. So because the new stuff gets buffen after the PTB they will play against something that seems strong the first moment but ok when you get used to it. But the thing is they will tell its to strong, BHVR will see: "Oh alot of people say its to strong" and nerf it (and thats fine because the game should be balanced around the majority of the players) but then after a month or so most of the playerbase will know how to play against this new stuff. Then the now nerfed killer will go from ok to weak. So what I am trying to say is that BHVR needs to keep the results from the PTB a bit longer since it will take time before the majority of the playbase will figure out how to counter things. 
---
An example for this:
---
When the Plague came to the PTB most playwrs on there figured really quickly that running in a straigh line while she pukes isn't a gold idea.
---
When Plague went life you nearly got like 2 weeks where everyone kept running in straight lines. Then it was demanded that she gets nerfed because she just infected everyone to quick.
---
And yeah I kinda can understand why you say only one side can change that but I alsl think that this is just the nature of a competitive game:
---
It's not fun to play the most fun killer if you know you from the beginning that all your skill won't matter if the other side doesn't make a mistake.
---
HybridPanda isn‚Äôt toxic

---
How come they called them balance changes then?
---
We are not on steam though XD
---
Amazing work!
---
For killers with low mobility its actually something a lot of higher rank players try to set up. Obviously the goal is for no gens to get done but i try to at least encourage certain gens to get done before others.
---
Damn so in game legions seeing survivors at the corner of their field of view... They are illuminati or that mask is just part of their eyes I suppose
---
Well while camping is for everyone free to do there are always two versions of camping. The one were you pretend to go away just so you can lure more people to unhooking and then easily kill them. (So you dont need to go and search for them). And then there is the hardcore camping where you stay like 5-10m away from the hook and do circles around it so nobody can unhook.  
---
He was doing the second version of it and two people got rekt because they were too noobish.  
---
Tryhard was more of the feel you got in the game. Like he was dominating as soon as he screwed over two survivors by camping and then still played like his life depended on it to do a 4k.

Like legit read some older patch notes they one refered to a cosmetic as, new style perk
---
But for real they basically classify killer bug fixes as balance changes
---
Same.with most perks
---
I KEEP SWITCHING BETWEEN EASY AND IMPOSSIBLE GAMES. AS KILLER ILL GO FROM GETTING PAIRED WITH 4 DWIGHTARDS WHO I KILL WITH EASE, TO A FULL SQUADETTE WHICH HALF GENRUSHES AND THE OTHER HALF RAPES ME WIN FLASHLIGHT SAVES. AND I CANT GET OUT OF THIS TERRIBLE MATCHMAKING LOOP. I JUST WANT TO HAVE A FUN GAME WHERE I MAYBE KILL HALF
---
It wasn‚Äôt made to be a teamwork game. Just options to help people for bloodpoints. It was made as just survival
---
Many people don‚Äôt know that. It hurts seeing medkit with bonus charges+instaheal
---
Yall wasting charges!
---
lol I wasn't trying to say 'nurse bad' tho it's just a funny comment
---
Yeah because every survivor is taking insta heals and tool boxes *every game*.  News flash, the ones that do are probably assuming the killer is running omega blink nurse which is why they're bringing it.
---
CRYBABY SWF THAT CONTEND I CAMP WHEN IN FACT YOUR SHIT FRIENDS GO FOR UNSAFE HOOKS.

PLUS, I DID TUNNEL A BIT, BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE I DESPISE CLAUDETTES. SHOULD'VE RAN SOMEONE ELSE. BUT YOU WANT EASY MODE. NO MERCY

---
Yeah unless you have been playing on some chinese variant of dbd there is always at least 1 purple item with addons every game. Unless you play in yellow ranks that is
---
I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. A killer suddenly moving really fast at the press of a button seems brain dead. It's theoretically clown but less skill. It also doesnt fir with what the wraith is. Restoring his old speed when they first showed of his buffs and have his "ghost" add on built in would help with mindgames and have better map pressure and one less add on needed. Its hard to buff most killers since they really arnt the issue. Its how powerful the maps are which is the issue
---
I couldn't agree more. I main Doc, but I probably wouldn't have bought him if he was DLC.
---
Oh damn genuinely didn't see that one sorry
---
I guess it's all the survivor's faults that you all have to play nurse/billy/spirit every game.
---
Great job uwu owo eek get noob
---
So instaheal THEN charges works better? Do you know how much of a difference it makes? I'm curious because seeing the difference it made with the flashlight makes me think that the difference is going to be pretty substantial.
---
Ik I wasn't talking about you, I was just talking about what I'm seeing in the comments, probably should've clarify
---
It took me longer than I care to admit to make that on my phone
---
If you wanna be good at survivor, just watch people like noob3 or monto. They're both pretty good. I recommend learning the 360 juke pretty early on. It's probably the most basic and one of the most useful jukes.
---
Ghostface is not really hard to learn. You prob need mapknowledge to be more stealhy. A good killer to start with is the wraith very simple to play to get better in every role, killer and survivor you prob should watch some lopping tutorials. This will help you a lot. With ghostface you should take care that you always have a wall, tree or anything you can hide behind. Avoid open places. Always go into stealthmode when you can to hide your terrorradius . When you are neat to get a exposed status on a survivor make sure you get closer to get a secure hit even if they break you out of your power then a down on any survivor will still worth it. You better avoid playing killers like nurse, spirit and hag at first. They are all very good killers but they desire a lot of strategy and knowledge to master.
---
Thanks, but I play on console, so I don‚Äôt know how well that will work..
---
what? you didn't elaborate anything regardless my question. my question was why as in why would i torture myself playing Spirit with no headphones and with a controller. all you said this is how it is on console. if i were to play on console, well haha i wouldn't play such game on console. even pc has enough shit to deal with to also have low fps and all the crap devs fail to fix on console and overall that type of game is simply not good for a controller.
---
Real talk though this is some of the scariest shit, especially when you don‚Äôt know who the killer is yet.
---
Ghostface really brought a scare factor back to the game.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm finding a game as ghostface right now actually!
---
No its the fault of your lovely devs too scared to make a strong killer. Hell if nurse or billy were made today they wouldn't hold a candle to current nurse and billy
---
Best advice is to just play and play. Take your beatings and learn. You can watch all the vids or get advice on stuff but the best thing is to just play. And no matter what side you‚Äôre playing pay attention to both sides, if you‚Äôre a survivor watch what the killer does and it will help you become a better killer same thing when you‚Äôre killer watch the survivors and get the feel of what they do. As for Ghostface he‚Äôs fun and definitely a good killer to pick up but if you‚Äôre really trying to improve your game play Wraith or trapper just to be forced to learn loops, chases and mind games. Myers is also a great starting killer.
---
The best advice I can give without writing an essay on tips and tricks. Is to watch videos on both sides. There are a lot of youtubers who mainly play this game like monto, noob3, bricky, farmer john, etc. You can learn the most by just watching them play and hearing their commentary on what they're busy doing.

I play on console too. Once you get the hang of it though, it will feel pretty natural. I'm not great at it but I can still do it about 80% of the time.
---
Ugh\~
---
I've always thought Rin actually has a really pretty face. When she isn't sneering and making her \[honestly comedic\] groans, even her blank, sad stare is pretty, not to mention her headshots in the cosmetic store.
---
Gl buddy
---
Thanks so much!
---
Thank you! I watch noob3 a lot already.
---
Great. Just make sure you watch others play as well. Since while noob3 plays killer sometimes, he's a survivor main
---
If you have a medkit with 24 charges, apply additional 8 charges and then -50% with an insta heal, you reduce charges of both the medkit and the addon, so now you have (24+8)/2=16 charges, the exact amount to heal yourself once, rendering the instaheal unusable. (As you need a bit of your medkit left to be able to press space while healing)
---
If you put the addons the other way around, you‚Äôd only reduce the medkit.
---
24/2 + 8=20. Now you can heal yourself once and then you still have 4 seconds left to be able to use the instaheal
---
Hard disagree, there are going to be weak killers and strong killers.  Not every killer needs to be able to win every single match like Nurse with add ons can.  If you care so much about winning every single game go ahead, play nurse.  Just don't bitch about not having variety.  Your killer choice is your choice, just like the Survivor's have the choice of being lames that run the same meta shit every game with insta heals/flashlights/toolboxes.  
---
Queue times would multiply numerous times over if every killer was as strong as nurse which is why I think you guys are being clowns.
---
Are you getting my DM'S?
---
*laughs in pulling the unhooker out of the animation*
---
I didn't know Rin had arthritis in her toes and deadly pale skin before the tragedy
---
5 I think or 6? I really dont want to get much higher IMO
---
Are you trying to defend his behaviour?
---
If you're worried about Ghostface, try Myers instead. He's much easier to understand and pick up, but he's also a better killer, and is honestly just better designed from the ground up. Myers and Spirit in my opinion are the two most fundamentally well designed killers in the game, outside of the Tombstone and Prayer Beads add-ons, respectively. Ghostface plays similarly to Myers, but with a heavier emphasis on stealth and not being seen.
---
If it's the stealth aspect that you're interested in, Myers is still a good choice, but you might want to look into the Wraith and the Pig as well. The Wraith is a very straight-forward killer and the Pig's ability has a very long complex description but it's that hard to understand once you try her out a few times.
---
Yeah this is it, they just look for an excuse, if it isnt because you looped then its because you had a lantern, or self care, or decisive, or whatever the fuck they feel like.
---
Yep, always insta-heal first then charge add-ons.
---
For example, the yellow first aid kit has 16 charges. Adding a Syringe reduces charges by 50% which gives it now 8 charges, then if you add bandages which gives 8 charges you now end up with 16 charges again. 
---
If you add the 8 charges first then the first aid kit has 24 charges, but then the Syringe reduces it by 50% leaving you with only 12 charges as opposed to the 16.
---
Daamn, looks real good! Did you sew the hoodie yourself?
---
cringe. just leave, damn.
---
Definitely not...
---
I think huntress is the cutest character
---
Yep, big F for this sad man
---
Exactly! Finally someone who shares my opinion
---
Pig , doctor and spirit (maybe nurse and LF)
---
I believe that the lullabies for both Freddy and the Huntress are static and cannot be changed. That being said, and while I still don't recommend it, due to how his aura reading works, Freddy can still use Insidious better than any other killer besides arguably a basement camping Leatherface.
---
Wow, didn't know that. 
---
Now this all makes sense.
---
Do you know some examples of such interactions with killer' addons?
---
It sounds like he‚Äôs like walking by a metal fence dragging a stick through it. This is fucking great.
---
Next thing I'm gonna hear is that monsterous s shrine is toxic. GUYS THE ONLY THING THAT'S TOXIC IS HOW YOU PLAY OR REACT. I do gotta say that syringes are pretty bs when you have a good swf
---
He who tbags last tbags longest
---
I'm wirh you , I don't think that Bill/Ash areas quiet as the other surv . And they cough when they run ( I know that Ash coughs , dunno about bill but I think it's the same thing ) .
---
I agree - the game needs some kind of scaling based on the make-up of the survivor team. 
---
E.g. 4 man SWF - gens take 50% longer to complete or something similar
---
Dude, I just got a 4K with ghostface....
---
I'll give it to you, an interesting idea, but why is your motto on this for when you need to use the bathroom? Unhygienic and unnecessary when I could have just gone.. before starting my game? I feel that competitive games involving precise timing shouldn't be attempted on streaming services until they're a bit more stable.
---
What am i looking for here

When you only post this to flex your custom perk logos üòÜ

I can guarantee you that the dream transition is just as annoying for him as it is for you.

I still don't understand why sexualising is considered a sexist thing. Sex is normal, everyone think about sex at least once per day. Men and women should be free to have sexual thoughts even with unreal characters.
---
He‚Äôs actually right, it is against the rules and he‚Äôs not defending him, just trying to keep you from getting in trouble.
---
If they have: lithe, sprint burst, balanced landing? Yup, thats exactly what they do
---
Today I was downed and sombody was healing me and leather face walked past probably three times and he somehow didn't see or hear us... He was rank 8
---
WAZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPP
---
Then the killer gets 5 stacks anyways. ‚Äú**Now it‚Äôs time to get FUNKY**‚Äù
---
i'm afraid it's not just you. 
---
With autodidact you get your first two skill checks almost instantly, then, once you have 2 stack an can actually heal faster, your chance of getting a skillcheck is reduced by like  80%
---
*Rule 34 intensifies*

r/uselessnobody
---
hybridpanda has to be the nicest guy to play this game
---
Yeah survivors have the luxury of normal queue times meanwhile killer takes at least 10 minutes to find a lobby and getting dodged by people playing on McDonalds wifi. Also when i play survivor i take mostly loot build because i know for a fact i can use loops and other mechanics to extend a chase. Meanwhile the killer's power and try to mindgame loops that need less than 40 IQ to manage.
---
Honestly, never crosses their mind to actually be good at the game to gain 4k's or what not instead of having to camp to ensure kills.
---
Whenever i play killer i just take down hatch and patrol the doors its way to easy to patrol doors on some much I think the hatch is way to killer sided right now if the don't fix doors
---
Indeed, if you let people get saved or you switch targets allot and they all live, apparently you're a shit killer.
---
Also when you're playing trapper without ruin or anyway to slow the game down and you're VS a swf gen rusher team? Are you bad or did you just get unlucky with finding a team that gen rushes.
---
Wait really? I though you didn‚Äôt get them if you owned the killers.
---
Hey don't tell anybody this is the only way I've been winning with Ghostface
---
Respect the 4% üôè
---
Yep all the time mostly when they come out of the locker slow but with dedicated severs it will become a thing of the past hopefully
---
Reminds me when I prestiged hag and lost my first game with only 1 sacrifice and the guys started giving me tips on hag. Made me less angry about the teabags and flashlights
---
I saw this in the anniversary finalists. Congratulation :D
---
Thanks! I didn't have time to make the hoodie myself unfortunately so I just bought one on Amazon however I did change the string, do the embroidery, and add of of the grime/details
---
That feel when the bugs in dbd are genuinely creepier than most of the killers
---
Yeah, his perks are all pretty good. He can also be fun to play in low-mid ranks.
---
BBQ never shows up on the Shrine so yes I would say he's the best killer to buy first because of that.
---
Flair checks out
---
Oh it's all auras btw I mean all gens totems other survivors BBQ some how exit gates hooks (only when you can see them) anything they can be in front of this glitch happens I mean anything if a survivor is ahead of a survivor that's visable because of object the outline is visible. If sombody is in a locker when your huntress and your out of hatchets you can see them. This patch is bad for aura related things.
---
How many times is this same joke gonna be made on here before people stop finding it funny sksksks üò≠
---
*wah*
---
I never created them. Why would i flex them
---
I‚Äôve had the same error. If you haven‚Äôt already, just task manager and end it before you open the game. Glhf
---
That‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt create these shoes, why would I flex them‚Äù
---
:( I tried so long thinking of a joke for about hope with that template to put on reddit but my feeble mind didn't think of this and now it's a massive post, I am sad :(
---
Not sure. Maybe on Michael Myers like putting a Evil Within charge faster addon in front or behind an addon that increases the amount of charge needed?
---
üòèüòè
---
Just found out someone did it first so I am also sad

"AND THEY COULD FIX A GENERATOR, INSTANTLY, WITH NARY BUT A BRAND NEW PART!"

Damn that is a big difference
---
WHY DO I DEPIP IF KILLER DC? IS THIS A BUG OR INTENDED?
---
Yep.  Thank you.
---
It might a type of bug that breaks 15726728 other things when you fix it.In TF2 there was an item named Gunslinger and it had a bug that persisted for years before getting fixed despite being known by pretty much everyone
---
Same. I hate when they do that. When I'm the survivor on the hook, it's basically like preventing me from falling off a cliff just so you can push me off the edge yourself. When I'm the killer, it's just really annoying. If I see someone doing that, I usually just knock the saved person out and go for the idiot who unhooked them.
---
Same here when I started to play this game I watched him all the time because I knew he was one of the better players in the community but after about a month I realized he really wasn't as good as I thought and got really salty when he messed up all the sudden I found zoobatlel and my God is he fun to watch
---
Right? When a killer sees me going there, I try to lead them away somewhere so somebody else can try to unhook the hooked survivor
---
happy cake day
---
*sigh I won't even try. He's not op, his power can be canceled pretty easily, and his perks are mostly bad
---
Ah shit, here we go again...
---
His power is powerful, but not overpowered. But his perks? How are they overpowered?
---
Oh god, I‚Äôm getting flashbacks of vacuum pallets
---
Oh damn, I didn't know tbh. I just thought his videos were pretty funny. D:
---
I'll try other youtubers then. Thanks!
---
Leatherface = camper
---
80% of the Leatherfaces I meet are either facecampers, basement campers or proxy campers. I'm sorry for the people that actually like leatherface and don't camp with him but the majority does. If he becomes a good killer, well..then have fun seeing all those leatherfaces popping up and camping you.
---
Do better. You're not going to feel clarity by calling him op. You can just run spine chill and not sit on the first gen you find until he comes patrolling for you.
---
Alright where the hell is my real life memento Mori WHERE IS IT I cans stand nea mains without moris WHERE IS IT?!??
---
Fair chance? Bullshit. Excluding some lucky games when the hatch spawns next to you, the Killer knows where it is long before the damn thing opens. Survivors take the shortest routes from one gen to another, yet it's Killer's work to basically patrol the map looking for stuff.
---
one survivor bringin a purple toolbox with addons offer maybe a global boost of 5% repair gen speed.
---
i had this yesterday and i kept having to fucking save them all, the killer didn't even camp or stay near them. Ended up in 2 of them dying and me getting hooked after a long chase. Last guy just waited in a locker next to my hook and didn't even bother to try and save me while the killer STILL didn't camp or whatever.
---
He ended up dying.
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Thanks!
---
That perk suck, I don't know why it's soo used
---
Queen‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
I'm down to roast a few people.
---
Didya know wraih can close hatch while invisible?
---
while the time of 32 seconds of survivors being occupied in total is right, the benefit of actually having the healing be finished 16 seconds earlier in real time makes a big difference to how practical it is. Those extra 16 seconds can be the difference between actually finishing the heal befor the killer finds you, or give you the time to run interference on the next chase the killer is doing.
---
Okay, and if you learn to mind game shack you‚Äôll get a hit there 90% of the time. It ain‚Äôt hard.
---
Susie is the only part of legion that I like. 10/10 cosplay
---
hence, just run autodidact.
---
Wow you are so good. You just lopped a brand new killer player. Go to your rank and show us how you get caught in 5 seconds, because you can only play against newish players that dont know the game yet.
---
there are no two killer add-ons that affect the same stat by % and by a flat amount, so there's nowhere to apply it
---
I'm quite sure you can't mod that without getting banned
---
Insidious may not stop lullaby but it helps with your aura reading. Don't know which direction the survivor is juking behind that wall? Just stand still for 1 sec at level 3 and insidious shows you so no more guessing. They can be right next to you and the aura still shows.
---
Actually I noticed that drop rates without plunderer's got better. In the last 20 games I got: 3 purple medkits, 2 purple keys, 2 red keys, 2 purple flashlights, 1 purple toolbox. That's really good.
---
I SWEAR THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS SUB THAT SORT BY NEW JUST SO THEY CAN DOWNVOTE EVERY NEW POST AND COMMENT. SOMETIMES I‚ÄôLL GO INTO A NEW POST AND LITERALLY EVERY COMMENT IS AT 0 OR -1. I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE THAT A COMMUNITY FULL OF SALTY DRAMA QUEENS WOULD ABUSE THE DOWNVOTE BUTTON THO
---
m1 Killer inc, OhYeah
---
Well, obviously !) But somebody must've tried to in private match or somewhere :)
---
Laurie, Jeff and Jane are way more annoying while injured
---
Yes but premonition has a decent length cooldown.  Plus Spine Chill is good for countering stealthier killers and ones like Spirit because it will still tell you when she‚Äôs looking at you even when phasing.  There‚Äôs several things you can do with Spine Chill that Premonition can‚Äôt do.
---
honestly though I feel like I see more ppl be toxic to the streamer than the streamer being toxic to them
---
I'm actually surprised this didn't happen as a bug in the actual update
---
Hiding behind gens doesn't work anymore, survivors' auras are brighter and more visible if killers pay attention ;)
---
Did they change it so you can't hear the Lullaby when you play as her anymore? 
---
I don't usually play as her but this last week has been all Huntress for me and i cannot hear her hum at all.
---
Distortion and Sole Survivor, the latter being complete trash so if you really want a perk use Distortion. But the best way is to hide in a locker or come closer to a killer.
---
There's the two sides of the coin
---
If you put TTV on your name you can expect to br mori'd and also expect to get tea bagged by him
---
So instead of trying to have fun themselves, they should invest hours into watching other people play the game instead of playing it themselves... Okay....
---
No you did the right thing
---
The plagg will be the hardest i imagine
---
Facecamping is only a viable strategy with braindead survivors.
---
Just do gens and punish their lack of patrolling.
---
Lmfao priceless
---
Him too
---
If the exit gates are powered, anything goes for the killer, no exceptions
---
I don;t think Dying Light is good... It's his worst perk actually
---
That has been a thing for like 2 years now. If you look it up you'll find this exact thing happening to other people. Would love to know what triggers this. Also would be nice if the devs would just fix it.
---
I‚Äôve just recently gotten the game and I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of ‚ÄúBHVR‚Äù on this reddit, can someone tell me what that means.
---
dev build gives you access to many things and disables EAC, so it would be much easier
---
No, I get it from survivor. I play killer to relax
---
Exactly, the game is fun but when you lose every time due to bad game design it takes all the fun out. And toxic survivors dont make any of it better.
---
Yeah when times like this come around you gotta take a step back, don‚Äôt let yourself be tunneled into anger
---
That's a bummer, I always enjoyed listening to the hum when I use her, I hope they fix it soon, even though I know most people that play her alot are probably sick of hearing it
---
Dead Hard has been in a bad state ever since they changed its animation. Still a really fun perk to use, but it only actually functions about half the time.
---
The ones who said this were rank 8s
---
Rin was already dying from a bad case of jaundice. What her papa did was mercy. #Justice4MrYamaoka
---
Hahaha, nice one!
---
Ohmwrecker is pretty good
---
Oh, I thought you were talking from a survivor point of view. If you can't hear it as the killer that's a bummer.
---
Oh man, when I spot survivors I've previously befriended in my killer lobbies I always shoot them a msg with a single üòÅ.
---
I usually get, "oh no" and "shit, am I about to play you?" 
---
We always go as hard as we can with our offerings and add-ons too. 
---
Sorry other rando's this just got personal lmao
---
It's very situational, life saving at times but no where near a guaranteed win. Endgame+Hatch close usually means you'll die anyways.
---
I got a game, it was my second plague game (i got her last week with steam sales). I managed to put 2 survivors dead on hook, 1 second phase and 1 sacrified. I only had corrupt intervention lvl 1 as perk. They did the gens, and when they popped the last one i hooked the 2nd phase surv. Then, as any normal killer would do, I started going form one exit to the other, passing near the hooked surv because he was kinda in the middle between the exits. They opened an exit, and when I was passing near the hook, he got unhooked. I smacked him down, hooked and killed him. In the end, ALL THE SURVIVORS were rank 8 to rank 2, i‚Äôm rank 11 as killer, and the guy I killed said I was camping and tunneling. It‚Äôs just annoying these days to play with killers you don‚Äôt know how to play...
---
You are aware that those points are not possible if survivors did not die on their first hook?
---
i would buy survivor Rin
---
For a second I got really confused and thought it was a representation of Ghostface going "Thanks" in a really condescending way
---
Just dont take the game so seriously. The game only gets frustrating if you play for wins and not fun.
---
Can this be our subreddit's newest meme format? Lol
---
Yea I understand some survivors have no awareness of the killer and treat him below human just because they're behind a screen.
---
I dont. I was asking because if so, I could bait a hit on the hooked survivor to learn if there was noed if a killer was camping
---
Granted, nothing changes
---
Your right but just kill them with kindness or agree with them! Years of playing xbox is that agreeing with the aggressor will most of the time not answer back. Its not worth arguing with them.  And just say that you are having fun! Just joke around with them. Do what ever makes you have fun! If you want more help with this situation i suggest you go and watch RunningMan37 .He has great stuff on how to handle these problems.
---
Wow so edgy and deeeeeep
---
You could always hear Wraith‚Äôs footsteps if you paid attention since there‚Äôs no terror radius to disguise them. Same as Spirit with prayer beads, you can hear her footsteps when there‚Äôs no whooshing sound. They might have adjusted the balance lately but they‚Äôve always been audible with a decent headset. 
---
I do wish they would turn it down on the killer side though, it‚Äôs really annoying having to listen to yourself stomping around.
---
Solution: make the game playablr by not tbagging
---
I'm glad to finaly have a reply that doesn't directly insult me. Thanks for staying civilised.
---
If you want additional cosmetics, I feel like they could just add them to the shop like any other cosmetic.
---
There are 2 problems I have with a battlepass that I do not have in the store:
---
1. Regardless wether you buy the battlepass or not, you'll go up in tiers. You can then see all the rewards you'd be able to get if you just paid a small price.
---
2. In combination with my previous point, there is also a time limit. It puts extra pressure on you: "if you don't spend your money now, all these rewards you could have earned, will be lost"
---
Then I'd like to address your argument of the other problems: I already spend about 60 EUR on this game, and now they'd change it.
---
Reminds me of a situation in rainbow 6 siege where they were planning to launch, what the community called, "operation censorship". Where they'd remove anything resembling blood, sex or gambling in their maps to make the game available for the chinese market. Community backlash was big on that one and it remained unchanged.
---
Obviously, thats an oposite situation.
---
To get back on track: games can have flashing images, blood and other things, but you shouldn't add them after people already gave money for the game.
---
It hurts me that the battlepass seems to barely have any backlash because after lootboxes, the battlepass is the next attempt to milk money out of players. And I'd like to push back anti-consumer practices as much as possible
---
either DC, Dying early, killing yourself on a hook or wasting time. All of them affect others.
---
just stay at your rank and keep playing. You'll learn more on a higher rank
---
She looks better dead
---
Yeah. Why I quit playing DBD... https://www.twitch.tv/arnettv_
---
Billy can spam his power without any downside. He does not have his camera turn down when he misses to allow survivors a chance to juke, he can just charge again right after he misses without cooldown, he can feather the power to wait for the right timing, and the curving allows him to hit around corners unlike any other killer. He is not balanced. 
---
Nurse ignores all survivors defenses the game provides. 
---
Also, every killer is powered by a literal god. By that logic, the previous Legion build was fine because you should not be able to escape a killer backed by the god of the world. 
---
How about if Clown‚Äôs tonic instantly downed someone if they go in the cloud? It is a god giving him the refill power, so it makes sense the god could do that. How about if Spirit had no cooldown on her power and could spam it repeatedly? Would that be fair and fun to play against?
---
Oh ho, you‚Äôre approaching me? Instead of running away your coming right towards me.
---
It happened to me but I could move, only the camera was stuck until I pressed M1. Try to M1.
---
glitched by daylight
---
Nah, leatherface has that title.
---
Let me guess, you hooked someone and then went a bit away from the hook and as soon as you saw him getting unhooked you went back and downed the person. And repeated that. You only got 15k bloodpoints, 2.5k of these bloodpoints were from the No one escaped achievement. If you play with a lot of chases, a lot of hooks and a lot of hitting, you get easily 28-32k as a killer. And survivors average at about 22-26k even if they die. Again you are new so whatever. But I just wanted to tell you that there is still a lot to learn. New players think that a 4k is the ultimate goal, no matter how you achieve it. But the ultimate goal is to have a good game for both sides. Especially on low ranks where survivors use their time so inefficiently, killers don't have to put much effort in to get a 3k/4k.
---
Most killers with insta downs dont need to be breathing down the survivors neck to use it.
---
You bring DS, i bring mori, its that simple
---
What did he even say lmao
---
It is a thing. EGC.
---
r/holup
---
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE DEDICATED SERVERS??? THE KILLER HAS BEEN CATCHING ME OFF OF FUCKING LAG. LIKE WTF KIND OF A GAME IS THAT WHERE KILLERS ARE REWARDED FOR HAVING WALMART CONNECTION???
---
Also me right now
---
Just max out bubba
---
It's true, to an extent.
---
So long as you are better at the game, you'll 4K more often then not.
---
Friend of mine can basically 4K at R1 with any killer
---
Once the gates are powered, all bets are off.
---
Okay first off if Billy runs into a object he gets stunned. For nurse you can hide or go lower in rank. I'm not saying the killers should be gods BUT they should be more powerful than the survivors as it is a HORROR game.  No it wouldn't be fun but it is a problem that every killer is getting nerfed right off the bat. We need some kinda op killers as most killers are only nurse and billy. Obviously people aren't going to use bad killers unless they like the killers being bad. We need a new meta. We need a op character because let's face it nurse gets boring to go against Billy will inevitably get you unless you have good teammates and can snipe you. If your sick of it then stop complaining about the new killers who are OP when a killer hasn't been out long enough
---
Spirit main here, what is this pallet looping you speak of?
---
Who, me? I'm definitely not a good player on both sides
---
Care to share any tips?
---
zero upvotes = zero people think mettle of man should be useable again? wtf okay killer main sub lmao
---
Freddy is an m1 killer with extra steps. Bubba has an instadown even if its bad. Bubba&gt;Freddy
---
Don‚Äôt worry about what other players say, especially when you kill them. People are always just salty when they lose. 
---
You can play overly fair and still be called a camper or tunneler. It‚Äôs just part of the game.
---
HYANH-HYAARRARAGH
---
I've also noticed that auras are yellow. Can't really hide behind gens anymore.
---
When you get face camped 30 seconds into the game
---
You'll feel better if you play for fun. Playing for wins in a game like this will just make you hate it.
---
I chuckled
---
when all the other 4 offerings are gruesome gateus and you feel bad for wanting to try your new ebony mori
---
WHY ARE ALL THE SURVIVORS I COME UP AGAINST WHILE PLAYING KILLER ARE ABSOLUTE GODS BUT ALL THE SURVIVORS I TRY TO SURVIVE WITH DONT EVEN KNOW TO NOT ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE WHILE ON A HOOK
---
This got me cracking up on a bus
---
What is great about this game is that it doesn‚Äôt take very long to learn the core aspects of the game but it takes a long time to really master it. I would find yourself a streamer/youtuber that you like and watch them play. Not all streamers are great players but you will likely be able to learn something from them. 
---
Other than that, I would say just find a killer and survivor you enjoy playing and have fun. You will lose a lot at first but as you keep playing you will keep getting better and better.
---
Such a concept would have worked for Ash Williams, considering that he has an evil doppelg√§nger in the movies.
---
Technically, due to the way our eyes work, you wouldn't be able to see if you were invisible.
---
Saw II Amanda was definitely the worst she looked in the original three movies imo.
---
but you can buy the lazy recolors with shards so you can buy 72%/75% of store with shards. It's only 8/5 % less than they told us. Devs are not stu pid enough to let players buy good quality skins with shards, they want to make money it's normal.
---
Yeah but it really isn't fun for the one hooked lol.
---
OMG! I want to be you for the next 24h
---
I have ttv in my name and I try so hard to not be toxic :x
---
awesome work
---
You've got to judge whether you should waste the stalk and go for a regular chase, or adandon the Survivor to 1-shot them later.
---
This is true, there is so much little nuance to it, and the game is all about efficiency, it's a race against time for both sides (maybe a little more so for killers) and as you play you will discover tons of little ways to do things faster and better. It's really cool if you're into that sort of thing.
---
&gt; They count, just the unfortunate truth.
---
I know, it's just kind of sad since it's a transparent inflation of numbers. Basically, "it's close to 80% counting the stuff almost no one wants."
---
Thanks for this. I started streaming 4 months ago and just hit 400 followers and it makes me fell great when killers or other survivors stop by. I try to not be toxic either. I'm just trying to make some money since I'm sick all the time and can't work and I enjoy doing this. 
---
I can't tell you how may amazing friendships I've made from being a dbd streamer
---
Me too man
---
It's their game, they can do whatever they want, just like the facecamping killer.

Here come's the trapper

Sexualizing both men and women isn't sexist.
---
Sexualizing nobody isn't sexist.
---
Sexualizing only women sexist.
---
DBD goes under the "both" umbrella, and in most cases it's pretty mild. TBH I DO find Rin's design... Unsavory, but that's a personal issue.
---
I‚Äôm new to dbd so I never heard it before I just watched a video of her getting stunned and now I feel so bad she really sounds in pain &lt;&lt;\3
---
If you think reddit is garbage, it's either because you browse /r/all, or because you haven't changed your subscription list. Once you unsub from subs like /r/funny and /r/pics and find subs you like, it gets a lot better.
---
I just don‚Äôt want to play when I get this map
---
I think Hag, her stance is just weird x)
---
If DarkWood was a skin.
---
the problem seems to arise usually if you use a perk whilst going through the escape. Sprint Bursting and Urbaning are both ways i caused it to happen. I did the sprint burst on purpose twice and it worked. Urban i just accidentally did
---
Ahahahahah this is high-key genius
---
So an m1 killer with nurses calling. Cool
---
üòÑ your title makes it so cute
---
Yea
---
Yea what the other guy said. If they're like 20-15 (maybe lower?) then they're gonna be either really bad or Smurfs to stomp on Lv 20 killers.
---
The worse has yet to come with you two when it comes to good survivors.
---
It's also useful if you are on hook when the last gen pops, or really just injured at all when the last gen pops.
---
Luckier than Ace

Justice.
---
Would it play out like the opening scene of the first Scream movie?
---
You basically can't. He's balanced around completely oblivious survivors.
---
At best you can play him as an M1 killer who can hide his terror radius to approach, or hide his stain for 2 seconds in a chase.
---
I want to see survivor Lisa
---
*Hex: Devour Hope intensifies*
---
Coxcombed ghost wraith or Scratched Mirror Myer‚Äôs on Lery‚Äôs are still the most horrifying things in this game.
---
But that‚Äôs the thing, the survivors don‚Äôt have to be good to deny a 4k, either individually or collectively.  They can all literally refuse to perform objectives and engage in the game and still yeet themselves out of the game denying the killer yet more bloodpoint and score on top of their total non-participation (because if they refuse to be chased, die on first hook, and don‚Äôt give the killer the opportunity to kick generators and pallets or use their killer power in a meaningful way, the killer is probably going to depip along with them even with a 3k.)  Even the most braindead ~~killer~~ survivor tactics can ensure the hatch, and I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs even more braindead because, to net 1 kill, the killer still had to actually participate in the game to some extent.  They had to hit someone twice which probably involved a chase, grab someone out of a locker, or (for certain killers) used their killer powers.  They then had to perform 1/12th of their potential objectives before they are able to hook camp and secure their scummy kill.  The survivors do no collectively or individually have to do any of their objectives before they can hatch, they just have to get lucky and press a single button.  I am in complete agreement that neither a 4k or a 4e should be the norm, but the fact that a kill requires active participation in the game while an escape can be achieved by actively not participating (such as intentionally sabotaging your team and hiding until you are the last man/woman left) doesn‚Äôt sit right with me which is why I disagree with the core concept that ‚Äúhatch is free escape‚Äù = ‚Äúclose hath is free kill‚Äù.  If the hatch required even 1 generator to pop for it to open then yes, I‚Äôd be compelled to agree, but it don‚Äôt so I ain‚Äôt.
---
Yo I have motion sickness spells every once in a while so I keep it low to prevent me from throwing up lmao
---
Aint exactly right anymore, in order to pip at high ranks - 3-4k's are required and even then there's a chance you'll depip. The new ranking system made it really rough.
---
I'm at Rank 6 and although I would like to try to climb to red ranks (which seems very impossible because of how good survivors get, especially if they're all SWF) I just want to rank up my Piggy to P3 at last. I got Myers to P3 and am very close to getting Piggy up there (P2 LV 50). I just need to get to a million again and then Prestige to 3.
---
yea try in the red ranks then come back and tell me how it went with pig

Apparently she had that deep cut above her hip before the tragedy
---
Before you pick a survivor up try and face a wall or some object that will block them from blinding you. If you see players bringing flashlights adjust your build, either bring Franklin's demise or light born. You could also fake the pick up of the survivor by just standing on their body for a second and then immediately turn around, more times than not the person looking to save will be moving into position to get the save - chase them and show no mercy.
---
Just report this shit. This is beyond toxic.
---
Can relate
---
Facing the wall will stop them being able to get the right angle. That, or pause before picking up the downed survivor and wait for the guy with the flashlight to run towards you, then turn around and hit them.
---
Only one word ..... Masterpiece
---
Yea I completely understand this. I'm in purple ranks and the games get really difficult when they're all SWF. They'll t-bag me and sometimes message me that I was garbage. I changed my mindset to just go for Bloodpoints so I can prestige instead of looking to rank up as i'm pretty content staying between ranks 7/6. If I were you, just play for BPs as well. Get some good offerings like Survivor pudding and get that character to 50. It's a good goal to avoid toxicity/ranking up.
---
I still think this is an urban legend
---
No as a killer this is perfect. You have a chance to escape. A killer does not want to spend 20 mins looking for the urbanly evading p3 claudette hiding in the swamps... Just move onto the next game.

How do you stack Shadowborn?

I can‚Äôt put you in the dying state without getting closer

That is like saying Nurses or Ruin is a niche. 
---
If you only think it has use with full flashlight squads, you are wrong. Flat out. 
---
It is one of the most reliable perks for killers. Give it a try. You would be really surprised at how you can turn the game around with it.
---
I don't really care about the change, but I just don't see the logic in it....
---
Yea I agree with this. My friend gifted me Ash and I played as him for a couple of games and when I got injured I really noticed that Ash's groans of pain are a lot louder than say Ace who I normally play as.

I don't get it and it feels bad. ;w;

I have 56 cakes on Myers. I'm going to try to save 50 and if not, at least 40 cakes for the next double BP event.

Lol I knew this video was gonna end up being posted here. Is he still doing ‚Äúno balance talk‚Äù streams? I haven‚Äôt watched him for a while.
---
But if there's a double BP event and  I run a cake, I could probably get 100-200K a game.
---
Always tunnel the toxic
---
No idea, i think so.
---
*smack* noice
---
There was probably a 2 SWF and one of them had spine chill. He was playing prayer beads spirit. He thought they were stream sniping cause they left the generators early. Idk, maybe they simply told them to get off the generator because they had spine chill? A thought
---
Sorry to break it to you but if you're from 4chan or 8ch or w/e those sites have been 'normie' since 2012
---
Jeez 2m2irl
---
Camping does not exist.
---
Especially when the other survivors are nearby.
---
Okay but hol up I never said it wouldn't be fun if we had op killers I said if we had god killers. Listen I don't think your argument is valid we need better killers so people play others. Thats what I believe no matter what.
---
I unsubscribed from so many places. r/memes, r/trollychromosome, r/teenagers and many more. Whatever you follow you can never escape endless reposts and Facebook trash. No moderator has managed to keep their subreddit clear of reposts. That's just how this site functions and it's so infuriating to browse lately. Most people just form a giant circle jerk where they hate Fortnite and Instagram and praise Minecraft and a couple "wholesome" celebrities for no reason. It's not funny, creative or engaging, it's cheap, karma whoring that gets praised because people like feeling like a community because someone told them they are "better" than other social media.
---
I‚Äôve gotten it before awhile ago when I was more active playing I‚Äôm pretty sure, it‚Äôs not anything crazy and you should still have your rank and everything
---
Your mind likely isn't all there when you're re-animated by pure hate and entity energy.

Guttural noises and your brain signal translating straight to facial features is likely normal practice for Rin.
---
WAAZZZZZZUUUUUUPP

i do.... everytime i play... can't pip or depip... is hell
---
P3?
---
I mean if you'd taken a moment to search you'd see this gets posted almost *hourly* and has done for *literally years* so i could maybe suggest that it might not be you and ^it's ^actually ^that ^there ^aren't ^enough ^people ^playing ^survivor ^to ^instantly ^fill ^your ^matches
---
if you're not actively being chased then what help is that last heal exactly? is it the 0.2 seconds you save going to a hook from the SB? is it the 32 seconds you save healing (alone that is the more ppl alive the less time spend healing too) and self care could've healed that during the match. the heal from unhooking is also useless since it's countered by noed so it's useless if the killer is close (lots of killer have that) and DH and BT both aren't and together give a much better chance to escape then just Adr.
---
in my eyes adrenaline is really powerful in only the following situation :
---
2 ppl left alive, you are being chased and the last Gen pops during the chase. then your instaheal plus burst give you a good chance to hide/make it to the exit. otherwise it's just gonna deny you your dead hard
---
All you had to do is search queue to find your answer
---
That ghostface did not deserve the kill. I'm glad this worked out!

I kind of miss that sound. It was basically my childhood

Wait I thought you couldnt use the hatch unless you‚Äôre the last one left?
---
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;for example&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read before comment, also: Nurse's calling and Ruin aren't as niche as Franklin's because they are perks the slow down or hang a consequence for doing things you do EVERY. SINGLE. GAME.
---
Well, I mean look at him. He probably doesn't consider running a hobby.
---
I LOVE WHEN GHOSTFACE TEA BAGS AND HITS YOU ON THE HOOK SO WHEN THE GATES OPEN AND YOU ESCAPE WHEN YOU TEA BAG TF OUT OF HIM, HE FEELS SO SHITTYYY. LMFAO! HE IS DEAD ASS THE MOST ANNOYING KILLER.
---
On ps4 I've been finding games in a minute or two at rank 6, east coast NA
---
Teabagging, following me around to block hooks, brand new parts, insta heals. Still managed to kill one of these idiots.
---
He gets stream sniped almost daily, so I'd say it's more likely he was sniped but it's possible he wasnt
---
nope same one
---
If you only get 1-2 per game that means youre not playing him right, look up some guides
---
Le fancy hat big brain MLG player
---
Apparently it was 3 SWF and the one solo player said that they were told it was tru3 and to burn a haddonfield offering
---
When I was a killer main I was a huntress and trapper at those ranks. I think people get so used to it they struggle with different killera which make it hilarious.
---
The Red Dragon.
---
Whytho?
---
Yeah, the first gen he ran to had multiple survivors on it (Discordance) so they probably saw Spine Chill go off and warned their friend(s), and from then on they knew he had prayer beads. Also assuming that a Blendette with Iron Will is evidence of stream sniping is kind of silly imo.
---
I‚Äôm a ghost face main this is so true lmao
---
That's good practice, if you can neat a team like that you can beat anyone :)
---
Can't blame him when you come in here saying "we're" like everyone on reddit is the same as you.
---
I play both and I actually find killer to be easier. I think it's because I play survivor so much that I know how survivors think, so getting 4ks while playing fair is easy for me.
---
I liked the one with the robot

Ok, they've used their balanced landing/sprint burst/lithe.

What now? You are faster than them, you catch up to them once the speed boost wears off. What do they do now?
---
I would equip it if this were the case. Sometimes I am 1 second away from wiggling out. I feel like the wiggle timer is too long...
---
I don't bitch about nerds, but I do bitch about SWF. Killers should be able to see when people are in a party, so they can either back out or adjust accordingly.
---
Not really. If you're getting chased all game when will you heal? :P
---
Spine chill is good for many reasons.  Firstly, because you will always see Spine Chill light up before you hear a heartbeat (if they're heading right for you) you can begin to take measures to determine their direction and probable arrival and still be safe.  If you have an idea of where they might be coming, start walking 90 degrees from the direction you expect they're coming from and judge if they're heading straight for your direction via heartbeat.  If SC turns off within a couple seconds, or flickers with the heartbeat growing, it means you were correct as to their position and don't know your direction yet.  You can plan your route without needing to run and often escape so long as you keep moving.
---
If it stays FULL ON, then you know they're coming from a direction that you didn't expect and should either start running or otherwise panic accordingly.
---
Additionally, you can know when they have lost you for a few moments during a chase so you have a better idea of when your fake-outs have actually worked.  This will tell you when to take cover for a few moments, and then run again when they do one more quick search in the area they lost you.  You can also tell when they're chasing someone else by the on-off pattern as a killer is being looped so you can safely complete generators.
---
There's an art to using Spine Chill.  It can be a best friend.
---
teenager? i thought she was already in college like in the lore said. she should be at least 20
---
Best thing to do is to just act like Dying light isn‚Äôt there since it counters the other two perks. I found the best time to play adept killers is during rank reset.
---
It was fun...
---
His perks synergise best when running the Tombstone Piece add-on. ignore the Obsession until you have max stacks of STBFL. Then find them and get your PWYF tokens. Finally Tier 3 on them and mori them. You keep your STBFL tokens and will not lose them, you keep your PWYF tokens for the time being and Dying Light gets activated.
---
Does anyone ever notice how people who hate on tru3 are always survivor mains?
---
For you. Murderer!
---
It's weird, the higher rank you get, the more fun killers get, and the worse survivors get :P
---
No one ever respects the Kobe anymore :(
---
I found that I tend to find matches at night quicker than I do in the morning.
---
i had a game the other day as LF when in the first 3 minutes i had 2 basement hooks and other guy hooked, so i let the last guy unhooked all of them , then i keep chasing and down them.... i hook everyone twice and then slug them until i have hunting, deviousness and brutality max... then i killed 3 of them and let the last guy escape... rank 6 btw
---
You better watch out for his traps
---
Lemme find my reply I always give to post like that.
---
Thematically I think the idea was "I'mma beat on you guys until I find my obsession and then when I do it's tunnel city"
---
Just run Franklins, lightburn, Enduring and NOED to piss survivors off.
---
Awesome! I might be able to participate in one :D
---
Nothing. But pallets will always be a thing so it doesnt matter talking about this
---
 
---
1, Almost NO ONE cares about their rank. It's not what ranks are for. The main reason they exist is to split experienced players from bobs that just installed the game.
---
2, That would make matchmaking even worse, as it would split the playerbase into two groups
---
3, New players will think the "Quick Play" is the mode for them and they'll start playing "Ranked" once they get good, making them much less likely to improve and it will take them a fucking long time to get into "Ranked". Just look at hearthstone. I was playing the Quick Play for almost 3 years before even touching Ranked mode and I know I'm not the only one. Now I wish I didn't waste all this time.
---
4, Killers HAVE TO sweat to apply pressure and not get genrushed into oblivion and teabagged at the gate. Survivors would see those sweating killers and start sweating too.
---
5, The only difference you'd see is more disconnects and having a mixed bag of baby and godlike killers and survivors
---
Yeah, luckily I'm decent with killer in general but I've never really used nurse before so my blinks were awful haha.
---
Overall it's a good learning experience, I just wish people were less toxic though I know it's a pipe dream...
---
AS THE TRAPPER WHY THE HELL CAN I GET STUCK IN MY OWN BEAR TRAPS WHAT THE FUCK
---
Oh shit. That happened to me when I was playing the reaper. I had to sit there and fall infinitely for like five minutes until the remaining survivors exited the map. It had been one of my best rounds until then too
---
they will prob never do that as it sounds nice but it would have a very bad effect on the game. since a lot of killers would just back up and swf teams will just say fuck it and stop playing and that will cost the devs a lot of money. at least in my opinion anyway
---
I mean, you're not wrong but all the killers I got today just let us heal each other, do generators and escape. The trapper made us walk into his traps (assuming for a ritual/blood points) but all in all, still very enjoyable
---
The hag. The skin eating thing after she downs you makes my skin crawl
---
Prestiege 3
---
Not even close to funny. You're just becoming too normie to tell.
---
telling the homies you got a key to the hatch
---
lead everyone their
---
last seconds open it
---
everyone else dies
---
You don‚Äôt though, go for the hit and if you get stunned, you can get rid of the pallet. It baffles me how many people on this sub are so afraid of the pallet stun, they‚Äôd rather be ran around a loop until bloodlust 3 and then force them to throw it down. Just go for the hit, worst case you get stunned and break the pallet and resume the chase. Best case you hit them through the pallet and then break it.
---
Exhaustion + Hindered is especially cruel. There is *no* escape.
---
Hey look, survivor only mains disagreed with you. But lets be honest, who cares what they think. You have a match to slip into the role of a psychotic killer, where does it say you have to play by anyone's rules? What works, works. Looking into a maggot's eyes while they squirm on the hook for t-bagging you after every pallet is especially satisfying though. Don't care if I lose the game, I'm happy.
---
If I had to guess I'd say Ghost Face will, I believe he sold well and so did his cosmetics so the licence holder may be more inclined to worth with the devs :) this is all speculation,
---
How is that weird ? There‚Äôs hundreds of towns called Fairview across North America
---
keys open the hatch even if other people are alive
---
even if the killer closes it a key can open it again
---
there is actually a trophy for all 4 survivors escaping using the hatch which is only possible when all 5 gens are already one since the hatch wont spawn until 1 more gen than there are survivors still alive
---
*WAAAAAAH*
---
Ah not bad, you've had a lucky string of killers then
---
You did great! wait until you become a God Nurse and they will DC.
---
More or less. Then there's ones that just camp the hook and stalk...not as fun
---
Exactly! If it's uncalled for then it's just a bad killer who doesn't know to play the game, but if you dare t-bag me your ass is mine.
---
Oh right, I‚Äôm still relatively new to the game so I didn‚Äôt know that! Thanks
---
"Why do killers complain about gen rush when its just doing the objective. Should we start saying the killer kill rushed when they kill people quickly?" 
---
They already do, its called 'tunneling'. The double standards in this games community really scare me.
---
There is a difference between poking fun at him and hating on him.
---
Also nice secondary comment because your otherone got downvoted, gotta get that karma back up, eh?
---
Thank you!! i‚Äôm glad more people like it than hate it. and yeah they suck but i love my tattoo so their opinion doesn‚Äôt matter
---
Downvoting just proves my point, MOB MENTALITY
---
yes!! üòÇ
---
It is a pipe dream, this game attracts people who enjoy bringing others down, for me there is no such thing as a toxic survivor because I don't let it bother me :) just keep note of who is toxic and bring a Mori next time, keep a hit list;)
---
Yes, but when those who suggest punishing tunneling more start screaming about "I'M JUST DOING MY OBJECTIVE YOU FUCKING PEASANT" and "genrush doesn't exist, reeee" I just laugh...
---
Such hypocrisy
---
the pig? thats a mean thing to call jane. i know she's very fat, but come on
---

---
The hatch spawns when the number of generators to repair= number of dead survivors, but it will be closed. You can use a dull or skeleton key to open the hatch for 30 seconds
---
Exeption to this rule is that when onely 1 Survivor remains in the game the hatch will spawn and open
---
I don't think you understand. Unsubscribe from all of the default subs and only subscribe to subs you like, and your home page will only have that content.
---
On safe pallets there is no best case, it takes about 30 seconds to catch up to them on most killers when they have a decent lead and are hitting safe pallets. 30 seconds might not seem like a lot, but that‚Äôs fucking ridiculous, since the pallet being ‚Äúsafe‚Äù means they will not get hit, they will have time to spare, they will hit you with it for the points, and they will run to the next ‚Äúsafe pallet. I have no fear of getting hit, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre assuming, I fear wasting an entire match being BM‚Äôd by poor pallet to window placement by the devs.
---
lol the black guy's face makes me laugh
---
Not nothing, they find a pallet/window loop and loop it to stay alive for as long as possible. 
---
It's how you play this game as survivor.
---
You got a kill against a team with 2 rank 5s. That's great for a first time nurse. Keep at it, been getting better at nurse myself and I promise you once you get the hang of chain blinking into hits you'll never go back to other killers.
---
i like when they act that way since i dont kill/sacrifice anyway, i just play for pnts. all they really need is a friend&lt;3
---
remember you have to projectile vomit ON COMMAND.
---
Tru tho. yikes indeed
---
I LOVE U AND IM SO PROUD OF U AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
truuuuuu
---
i'm ready for this quest
---
I main her and am still pissed it's so quiet now. The humming was a huge part of what i enjoyed playing her. Now it's super quiet.
---
I mean it's better to hear survivors, but all the relaxing part of playing her is gone.
---
Well now i am sad.
---
What's the point of playing a killer if you're not killing?
---
Following the objective of a killer role is a scummy way to play?
---
Wait there are DbD-like warcraft 3 funmaps?
---
Yeah, red ranks is a pain in the ass. I'm not exaggerating when I say just about every match is a 4 man or 2 and 2 SWF. All equipped with Adrenaline, Dead Hard, DS and whatever specific perk one has as their job. And everyone has either a purple flashlight, keys, or InstaHeals. I was at Rank 2 for a couple days constantly getting Brutal Killer with 4ks. Finally, reached Rank 1 with a Merciless and 4 iridescent emblems.
---
I inhaled more sharply than usual this afternoon. Maybe I should make a thread about it.
---
If they run to a strong loop stalk them to 99% then fuck off and go after someone else.
---
Can't really blame survivors for looping though, if you just run in a straight line you're dead too
---
Gen rush == poor map control (esp with Spirit)
---
Gen rush =/= game is against you
---
They should make the legion a survivor, maybe not Frank. Frank was the leader who told them what to do, and the rest just followed. They never wanted to kill, so maybe something something lore, something something entity, and they become survivors.
---
I really like a siren based killer! i would 100% buy and play this chapter! im not a fan of the male/female based perks much but they are cool in their own sense! sirens and medusa are like my favorite mythical creatures they are so cool! nice job!
---
In what world is it fair for a survivor to get a free escape even though they couldn‚Äôt complete their objective ? The killer deserves the 4K if he put out enough map pressure to prevent the gens from getting done
---
It's probably downloading future content, so that the other update is less heavy. Lots of games do that.
---
The audacity when the last patch "fixed the used language for the player pip error".
---
You guys who whore out the word "cringe" are so fucking obnoxious.
---
I get this after every game as survivor, can't rank up or down. So if I wanna play survivor I have to play against low rank killers, it's not fun at all so I guess I'm a killer maim until it's fixed.
---
The term you are looking for is "scaroused"
---
I too feel that way.
---
bag o' sticks the hip new band, even hipper than the smashing pumpkins
---
no it doesn't dull the aura, it completely blocks it. Unless part of you is sticking out past the gen you will be fine. If the killer comes to your gen it was prediction/ bad luck, not bbq
---
Except you don't know if someone is bringing it before starting the match.
---
He clearly noticed you were going for that flashlight burn and wanted to uncloak really fast
---
yeah her lore says she was in university and also working part time but that can kinda put her anywhere from 18 to 22
---
How many lower rank killers have you been matched up with since they screwed matchmaking as a whole?  In all seriousness I get put with a lot of Rank 13-17's anymore and I'm Rank 11.  (Moreso cause I don't play nor stream this game as much anymore, but still.)   
---
You can try and act like Twitch streamers are the Holy Grail of toxicity in this game, but I feel that's a cop out and just a scapegoat.
---
Yea I hate the matchmaking in this game. If people do SWF it should use the highest ranked player in the group to match against killers. It sucks for new players like me.

You have a problem by constantly denying the truth and facts. Unless you are a female your eyes naturally gravitate to her tits; its human nature of males. If you want to deny this fact again than you are a dumbass with a lack of education.
---
Survivor mains angry at the truth.
---
So... before the tragedy she was drowned? Because that is what I feel when I look at her. Also is that just me or this "Before-the-Tragedy" version of her is even creepier then "After-the-Tragedy" spirit form?
---
Looks like she accidentally got him, dead hard...
---
i really like it! the survivor perks are really good if i may ask trust issues maybe increase the ability to like 3/5/8 or 4/6/8 seconds?  relatives the devil is super awesome but instead of a 50% make it 60% so its a high reward for putting your self in danger....? and for defense measure id make that 45 seconds a 50 cause rebuilding a good palet could alter the game so much and can you rebuild killer shack palet?
---
that mf Legion who got looped for 4 gens only to get all of us with his shitty ass moriüò§
---
[WAH INTENSIFIES]
---
Damn, she got you with that quick quick hatchet.
---
[https://imgur.com/01xcOCF](https://imgur.com/01xcOCF)
---
totally worth it tho
---
You literally have a mechanic that makes you faster for the chase being longer, and not every survivor teabags (it‚Äôs literally a way of communication between usüòÇ it was never meant negatively, or at least by the majority of the populous it wasn‚Äôt, it is mostly Hello - Bye - come on - or Good game, and in chases it just means that we want you to Keep chasing us.) after every pallet, but regardless of even that fact, it is YOUR choice to chase one survivor the entire time, YOU made the choice to waste that time. It‚Äôs not impossible to abandon a lackluster chase and find someone else. Not saying there aren‚Äôt toxic survivors, because there are, but situations of this nature are honestly a lot easier to deal with than a lot of people make them out to be, speaking from experience.
---
You're definitely right. It's more a dream than anything. Maybe we can have it both ways where a killer can leave, but they depip.
---
Still just a pipe dream, though.
---
The solution is pretty simple, if you don't bm the killer won't bm. If you want to not play the game, just bm. Simple stuff.
---
Okay
---
This comment makes me laugh
---
And neither does the botanist, but she's silent as the grave when she runs lol
---
Bruh even from an artist standpoint that does not make sense. You should repost this to r/niceguys . I'm sure someone there will tell you you're right since that's what you want so bad.
---
Lol relax dude, we all get some shitty messages sometimes, just ignore them
---
So... Sexualizing only man is sexist too, right?
---
i hope that Nea died for not protecting a baby Dwight
---
It's whatever, probably a couple of little salty teabagging shits.  Even rank 1s that play both sides mostly agree that this game is survivor favored at the highest levels. Why else would the list of *consistently* viable killers be so damn small?
---
Your options are either play a killer with high map pressure or hope to fuck your Ruin doesn't get popped in the first thirty seconds.
---
Lmao I posted it in all caps bc it was rage Wednesday
---
"Toxic bully fail" lol tru3 acting like a crybaby with his titles. Its not like hes playing nice and fair all the time. Every group of survivors thats not acting like noobs are toxic swf in his eyes. Ive seen myself in 2 of his "swf" videos already. And both times there wasnt any survivor friends. He just gets offended pretty fast when survivors do a good job working together.
---
WAAAAAZZZZZZZUUUUUUUPPP
---
Ooh, you got us real good.
---
Preach, Father
---
The hatch spawns like this: if there are 4 people alive, all generators must be complete. If there are 3 people alive, 4 generators must be complete. 2 people, 3 generators, and it always opens for 1 person
---
Seconding everything here. An excellent write-up.
---
Precisely. People act like BHVR doesn't make custom shit for killers *all the time*.
---
* Huntress hatchets appearing in lockers
---
* Jigsaw Boxes
---
* Plague Fountains
---
* RBTs
---
Chucky uses voodoo and the Entity modifies all of the Killers powers. If you think that a lack of current animations is gonna stop Chucky from being added, you're a fool.
---
He just thinks everyone is a sausage, even himself.
---
For him this is  a sausage fest.
---
Just keep going. Yea it can be frustrating, but you'll get there eventually
---
Yea but on the other side, she wants to kill you with a machine that nearly blows your head
---
Practice makes perfect (: it‚Äôs not about being good it‚Äôs all about having fun
---
4K=defntly high rank camper ez, git Gut trash
---
You should'nt show here that you lost using NOED and Ebony Mori or you blamed SWF teams when you using these things, people will start to harass you for that.
---
She did not! We both escaped in the end but I‚Äôm still a lil bitter üòÇ
---
I‚Äôd love to experience the end game entertainment
---
Ez, GG camper/Tunneler. L2P noob killer :'(((((((((
---
I‚Äôm saying the whole situation can be circumvented with the removal of safe pallets. There‚Äôs realistically no reason for them to exist, all they do is low skill players into higher ranks, and frustrate better killers. There shouldn‚Äôt be pallets that allow a survivor to be untouchable to extended periods of time just because it doesn‚Äôt allow for chase or mindgames. I shouldn‚Äôt have to always play Spirit, Nurse or Huntress to kill people. But that‚Äôs how it be.
---
with the dedicated server, we might see less of a bullshit of hitboxes ..etc. right now the killer sees the hit connect on his screen but it actually isn't on the other side it is way too complicated.
---
I am pretty sure Billy mains also hate him, because he always says " Billy isn't close to Spirit in tier list" and that seems to trigger people a lot in his streams.
---
Honestly I like the guy, and I‚Äôd really like to know why he is such a taboo subject in this sub. I‚Äôve watched him for a year or so and he just plays the game, on both sides as well. His ego can get the better of him yea, but that‚Äôs really all I know as to why he‚Äôs such a hated topic
---
WHY DOES EVERY KILLER CARRY SURVIVORS THE SAMS WAY? WOULDN'T IT MAKE SENSE FOR SOME TO JUST DRAG THEM TO THE HOOK? PLS HELP
---
Ok! im gonna be honest with you! i like it! im not a fan of regain hope but the other 2 survivor perks are good! regain hope sounds like another perk (cant think of it).
---
Didn't answer my question.....
---
I am pretty sure the "80% - 20%" ratio was based upon the very first cosmetics that'd come into the store, not what'd come afterwards.
---
Lol right? Like wow you said "high five" , real 'owned moment' right there... Yawn
---
I think you have to sit in the locker for 4 sec
---
This strat can beat god
---
Tbh it almost definitely won‚Äôt happen. It would take a while for the team to make a new model and then make the skin. And judging by myself and the other comments it doesn‚Äôt look like many people would want this stuff.
---
Switch off chat=happiness
---
She's so pretty.
---
It‚Äôs decent. Not everyone has to run the same perks in this game.
---
...... OMG!!! i feel so stupid...... females can be doctors btw lol! males can be nurses! wow lol
---
You're really afraid without self care, right? 
---
The Houdini perk build is lithe, dance with me, q&amp;q and lightweight. 
---
And self care better than adrenaline? Are u serious?
---
Ik but the devs went with the stereotypes soo... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôd probably just say don‚Äôt buy it, if you‚Äôve no friends to play with I guarantee it‚Äôll be difficult to enjoy it unless you play killer (which is fine, I do) but even that gets boring after a while.
---
this is a bug rn, had a match were i only got 2 kills with ghostface buy the other 2 couldnt leave cause of it
---
Speaking of Spine Chill, I like Tru3, but he tends to sell it short, when he uses prayer beads he won't believe how some people never get gen grabbed, when Spine Chill is the one thing that counters it hard.
---
same thats why they should freakin put it in the game! my money would go to a male spirit!
---
Yeah. I think it'd be nice for everyone to start using them at the same time so that
---
true lol
---
Hopefully the money goes towards a new dev team who won't break the game every patch.
---
So that what??
---
Just pick a side, survivor or killer, play a match, then try the other side, play a match.  Play whichever is more fun for you, or play them both, doesn't really matter because you can use the points you earn from a match to level any character you like.
---
If you don't wanna go in completely blind I would recommend finding some tutorial videos.  It's not a difficult game to understand, but it can be difficult to get good at.
---
This is such an underrated post God damn it.
---
People always complain about &lt;character&gt; not having many skins but in reality, this applies to everyone besides meg and Claudette. Imo the only people who can complain about cosmetics are people who main licensed characters.
---
But if it makes you feel any better usually the devs do random events where you can buy certain unobtainable skins with shards, so hold on to your 22k and hope for it to happen soon.
---
I have no idea what I‚Äôm looking at.
---
They could just take a model from an already existing female.... and just change the skin from there..! true but like would you want to see a male nea or a male feng?? ;)
---
See, the sad part is, I DO expect to be mori'd. I also expect to be tunneled, camped, and talked down to. The the while I'm in the after game chat (as killer or survivor) saying "gg. I love you all. &lt;3. Thanks for the game." Yet, people are still like, only 20 viewers? Lol. You're trash. Uninstall. I feel bad for your viewers. And the list goes on and on.
---
Look. I get that a lot of Twitch streamers are dicks. I really do. That's why I built the community that I have. I'm just saying,  be cool if someone else is being cool to you. It's a game, and we are all people in the end, ttv or not.
---
Trapper was the only killer who killed infinites and made hooks more dangerous with his traps back in the 2016 glory days of DbD.
---
Yes, I didn't disarm the traps when I unhooked someone.
---
He‚Äôs extremely opinionated and doesn‚Äôt know when it would be smarter to not engage with people or to drop something. For example he complained loudly about people deranking for a while, and then started deranking himself a few months later. Whether he was justified or not, if he‚Äôd just stayed out of the argument in the first place it wouldn‚Äôt have come back to bite him. 
---
Some people like this aspect of his personality and some don‚Äôt.
---
Wow, I've had that happen and I think it eventually "exited" me after I stood out there in the grass for a while. I didn't attempt to fall into the hatch haha
---
Playing killer is a trip, because I came in thinking I was the villain, and found out that I couldn‚Äôt have been any more off the mark.
---
Woah...
---
that looks even scarier than how Nurse moves!
---
Honestly I would just prefer they make more skins for the characters I like, but that‚Äôs how everyone thinks isn‚Äôt it?
---
Well Regain hope was based on the perk called ‚ÄòHope‚Äô. So it builds on the concept of getting quicker at something when something else happens. I‚Äôm happy you liked that chapter though!
---
If I‚Äôm hooked I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúlosing‚Äù state, and no. I will not stay in these matches. I will do what I want, when I want, and I want to leave a match by not disconnecting but by suicide in match, aka something I can‚Äôt be reported for. I‚Äôve already fucking explained half the time it isn‚Äôt in my control or my fault that I get caught that early.
---
I'm obsessed with this meme.
---
\*laughs in Nurses\*
---
Theres only 1 map in the game it can't be used.
---
Pizza Dwight in a toxic group...? Never...
---
D: you betrayed your true identity for that? SHAME SHAME SHAME SHAME
---
I cannot disagree. It still doesn't mean people shouldn't be given the opportunity to prove that they're decent. 
---
See, I always assume everyone is decent until they prove me wrong.
---
What with this micro aggression in every reply... have a conversation you fucking sponge
---
Ty!!!
---
I cant play survivor I can't escape the killer then I get salty ad at myself for running into every possible wall box tree like hey killer come get me I'm in a wall
---
I think he meant specifically for Haddonfield, Balanced Landing is a monster.  It's a tough map for killers but if you are struggling at the start,try to force a three gen situation.  It's a small enough map that you can easily patrol a gen cluster.
---
I‚Äôm just saying this should be an ability for witch
---
So you didn't watch the video?
---
I don‚Äôt blame them for wanting money, like I said I wouldn‚Äôt even complain if we had a lot of skin on Feng.
---
But it‚Äôs the fact that we don‚Äôt get an alternative in buying it with shards.
---
I would never tell them to give it to us free but at least give us an alternative
---
I don‚Äôt intend to. Just thought it would be interesting. I don‚Äôt think Freddy‚Äôs power is interesting at all.
---
Eh balanced landing isn‚Äôt as much of a crutch as this comment implies. It only really provides an ‚Äòeasy win‚Äô on haddonfield. Otherwise it‚Äôs just another exhaustion perk.
---
Well of course if you run balanced landing, and you are getting chased, you have to go to a place on the map where you can make the most use out of that perk. I was talking specifically about Haddonfield in this case, but it works on almost every map, if you know how to make good use of it.
---
Why don't you do that? lol you call someone a troll because I disagree with your idea of adding more gens is ideal...wow you really are pathetic and don't how to debate someone which shows you just lost. You should do that.
---
oh ok! and yeah it was really good! id really like to see it in game :)
---
yeah
---
i thought it was just called painful face sticks. i could see either.
---
I just want a killer that disguises as a survivor so bad. I know it isnt viable and SWF would ruin its life, but I still can wish
---
Genrushing DOES exist, but if everyone Genrushes (or if a killer tunnels) no one is getting good points or a pip
---
I‚ÄôM A SOLO SURVIVOR AND I CLEANSE EVERYTHING! I REPEAT: CLEANSE THE TOTEMS!
---
He literally mentioned it in the video.
---
Now that you put it that way it makes a lot more sense to just be able to drive the car instead of looping
---
Because it's not fun to camp or tunnel? It's not fair at all on players who just want to play for fun and not take the game seriously. 
---
Also where did I say anything that happened in the game was abuse in reality?
---
I had something similar happen; was in a game with randos, and found the basement in the shack.
---
I was rummaging around, and went to leave when the Killer downed a Survivor just outside. So I sneak into the back, expecting to do that exact same thing.
---
Only, it turned out to be Bubba. He hooks his Meg, and...proceeds to stand there staring at her, and hitting her. Well, I‚Äôm aware of the crows, so I quietly sneak out behind him to the other locker. And kept doing this the entire time, and even stopped at one point to point at him repeatedly.
---
He never did leave until she died; I can only hope I provided some laughs. Did manage to escape that game, too
---
It's like people who complain that way either never played a multiplayer game before or still don't understand the PvP environment in games.
---
dont forget they also call you noob sometimes if you use ruin and they couldnt find it in the first 20 seconds, while its common for survivors in red ranks to use as many 2nd chance perks as possible. (60 seconds after getting unhooked is NOT antitunnel)
---
Apart from that, but there's ones where you just know they're being fun.
---
Did you read more than one sentence into that post? Or are you unintentionally demonstrating that posters here have the attention span of a mayfly?
---
Says the 25 year old female that works in customer service still...thats a "yikes" as you children would say. lmao!
---
That would be hard to do, to create an entire new model for the character. Skins aren‚Äôt hard to do because its just applying something on a base template and then adding it to the game. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt like it, but others might so
---
We truly live in a society.
---
Lol why are you even on this sub? You're not even good at the game!
---
survivors are using adrenaline what's your point
---
thank you :D!
---
Nah.
---
Just give me Poised already, I don't want to Grind Jane for it ( he he heee)
---
LMAOOOO
---
Okay, but like, who tf cares? Just don‚Äôt watch him then? I fail to understand, it‚Äôs like all the people that specifically go to PewDiePie videos and downvote all of them because he called some a n****r. If you don‚Äôt like his content, don‚Äôt click. Easy Peasy.
---
WWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPPPP
---
slug them
---
Most brocken combo would be your typical op nurse + mintrag make your choice hag
---
I'd whish they let us customise kyf, the comunity would find a balance version of 2vsX they could copy for matchmaking
---
Imagine having noed and not being able to kill a single person
---
No, you enable it in the game properties window under "betas"
---
yeah! that is true but couldnt they just take a female template and just change things from there?? or am  i just completely wrong?  what are you looking for in a cosmetic?
---
I can't understand yet why ppl r downvoting most of the comments.
---
Why do her buff ass fucking arms bother me?
---
Eh that's more of a taste thing, some people like certain colors more.
---
&gt;‚ÄùSometimes when he plays killer he just wants someone dead‚Äù
---
By the gods someone stop this maniac
---
Two man groups are fine 
---
Three is iffy, it‚Äôs depends on how they play 
---
Four is where it‚Äôs very survivor sided
---
Not fun for you, you mean? You do realize it's a asymmetrical horror game? It's never supposed to be fair fun-wise. I'd suggest stop being emotionally attached to casual online games and start accepting the fact people are allowed to play that way, otherwise getting angry won't help. Afterall, it's just a game.
---
&gt; Also where did they say anything that happened in the game was abuse in reality? 
---
Well, you didn't say that and I didn't imply you did, I replied with these words to somebody else.
---
Sadly, yes, if we're being honest. 
---
The reason I bought this game was to survive being hunted. I wanted to experience the thrill of a being chased by a Killer and doing my best to evade him and hiding from him. The feeling of knowing I couldn't fight, so I had to run and hide.
---
That's the reason (I believe) most people originally bought this game, especially back in 2016 when it first came out. 
---
Then people started running infinites. Then, the Developers finally got rid of them (after first denying they existed). Then, people discovered (thanks to the buffs to Pallets) Pallet Looping, which remains to be the top strategy with Survivors. This strategy is very effective against well over 50% of the Killers, with some having no real method of countering it beyond mind games which don't really work at some spots (except with glitches like the one in this video).
---
It just amazes me. Who actually finds looping fun? I try to never loop because it's not fun. I'd honestly rather they nerfed pallet looping and add more pallets or even add something else to assist in chases. Literally anything so we're not constantly running laps around things.
---
Holy....I'd never thought about the fact that for about 8 bucks you can get a whole new killer with a new power set, a survivor, 6 perks that change up the game, and a map (typically.)
---
But for 10 dollars you can dress Feng as a pretty pretty ballerina. Yeah, I think BHVR needs to rethink their store pricing.
---
If can get a horror icon like Ghostface or Ash for 5 dollars with 3 perks as well? 
---
I should probably only have to pay no more than that to dress a character in a skin.
---
Everyone is a 4 man SWF to Tru3 tho.
---
The Wraith has a mask too, though :/
---
I would even go so far as to say that a two man group on voice comms has an unintended and unfair advantage.
---
The prices are insane. A chapter costs $7-8. A new character costs $5. Are you seriously trying to say a couple of non-event or licensed cosmetics are worth more than of the same as entirely new characters. If this was a F2P game I could understand, but it‚Äôs not. DbD costs $20-30.   At the most, the very rare skins should cost $5.
---
I don't think I've seen a video yet where he camps someone and most chased he knows that will take to long he backs off. Idk where you got any of what you said from unless you're talking about hitting someone who just got unhooked ( ya know the smart thing to do)
---
Triggered you enough to respond, eh? 
---
Seems like it worked **pretty** well.
---
I played on haddonfield recently as both killer and survivor
---
Survivor: I was being chased by bubba (the cannibal) and found a house with two windows that was a straight drop to the bottom floor. I jumped out the back window and he followed, i jumped out the front window and instead of going up the stairs one more time I went around to the back and lost him. Another tip for haddonfield is if the houses have flickering lights theres a generator inside.
---
Killer: Lots of survivors are going to be trying to juke you out with the windows, I bait them most of the time with my red stain, and once they drop down I go down the stairs instead. It‚Äôs just trying to get the survivors away from the house.
---
I think they meant viable, not entirely sure though lol.
---
I know right ?
---
What's the problem with the reversal of values and this generation ?
---
Its better than finding "No mother"
---
r u i n
---
Escepe is not an escape.
---
Did that one sting too much? Yes, that is why I am rank 1 killer and rank 2 survivor...actually its because I dont work a dead end job in retail going nowhere.
---
I would do the gens.
---
Just certain perks are considered "toxic," by which of meaning "meta," but toxic is the word more used so I'll generally use it, it's just more annoying to go against, so by the definition of "toxic" by the community's standards, yes, survivors are toxic when they use toolboxes and instaheals. It's just annoying to go against, especially when you see the same perks, add-ons, and items in every game on either side, for me it's kinda getting boring when every 5th game is actually fun and the rest aggrivate me. I'm seeing improvements though so I'll take it. Maybe some day not every Billy in the red ranks will run Enduring and Spirit Fury? Maybe some day everyone won't run Self-Care, Spine Chill, thenother meta that's annoying to go against, and actually try new builds? That would be more fun to go against. Besides gen protector doctor because... obvious reasons... lol.
---
Petition to change the Stallion used for ‚ÄòBoil Over‚Äô to this exact scene.
---
Haven‚Äôt touched the game in months, also a survivor main. I just appreciate unbiased opinion like any other sane person
---
If you have played Last year you realize how good a coordinated team can become. But personally I find facing SWF fun, it is a nice challenge. I would rather play a long intense game where I lose than a quick stomp.
---
Not if you spaz out with the thumbstick lol
---
Buying it with shards is free. They don't get anything from it, so why would they pay people money to make a net loss? You'd be a terrible business owner.
---
They see the aura of you climbing out of the locker if you exit it early.
---
Bodyblock for another to unhook or do generators and consider him dead.
---
Haven‚Äôt touched the game in months, just like the subreddit. Survivor main btw supporting unbiased opinion. Funny how so many people get butthurt upset
---
Wait till you get to the red ranks. Becomes nurse, spirit, or billy if your aiming to consistently get 4ks
---
You accomplished nothing, you just wasted your own time standing still looking at someone
---
Facts.
---
I don‚Äôt think they did, because I was playing as killer and had the gray bar when hooking someone at endgame
---
Freddy has somehow become one of my most played killers. I‚Äôm nervous about this rework :(
---
i‚Äôve found this works really good against camping leatherfaces. most of them don‚Äôt do it for points or to win, they just do it for the sal,t and only the salt. so when you are nice to them in postgame that destroys them.
---
you just have to make sure your teammates are nice too, which can be hard. if 1 person is salty then he‚Äôs gonna win
---
Well I mean if you get enough potatoes eventually you will rank up. You're already getting bullied in the higher ranks that's why you complain about DS which only works on people who tunnel. If you have to tunnel to win you're a trash killer point blank.
---
What? I'm not getting angry whatsoever, everyone has different views. I don't get emotionally attached as I understand it's just a game but when I play a game I want it to be fun and enjoyable.
---

Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong, SWF gives survivors a significant advantage over playing solo, I‚Äôd classify 2 man as fine just because it‚Äôs still handleable under normal circumstances
---
Oh wait what? Damn I might need a submission then
---
When I got good at No perk Laurie at rank 1 last 6 seasons...
---
All perks have the same power, and I prefer to not use too many perks that killers hate to play against, because I don't need them anyway.
---
Kind of got something like that on a Jeff a few killer games ago. On the pale rose map I think, he kept leaping in and out of lockers (he didn't have head on so idk what he was doing tbh) went to go grab him and ended up just smacking him instead. Wouldn't be weird if it wasn't for the fact I was playing doc in treatment mode and it would force me into punishment mode to do the swing/hit animations. Happened 3 times on that one game with that one Jeff regardless of what mode I was in, only hit him once for the 3 times he did it.
---
Nope, I play at rank 1.
---
let him die-&gt;do gens-&gt;exit game
---
Ye, my current build(s) is Dead Hard (or Balanced Landing), Object of Obsession, Borrowed Time &amp; X (WGLF, Iron Will, Hope, DS...)
---
Its meant to evolve around an obsession. Basically you can either kill them early or save them for later.
---
Well... it is in a junkyard for a reason.
---
"BULLSHIT!!!" - Me, every game, 1.6k hours
---
But when I play Clown at red ranks and end chases relatively fast and still trade about 5 hooks for the whole game being finished in 5 minutes, with Ruin....then get tbagged. I need those killers with better map pressure. 
---
Sometimes I have to wait to play fun killers for rank reset. 
---
Ya ya I know, I‚Äôm not the best at killer but my god it‚Äôs stressful.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Spirit, seeing her in game makes me want to DC. Rank 7 and I always manage to get the spirits who have been playing her since the got the game.
---
Piggy definitely a close second but shit least I can win against her, only won one game against a spirit and that's just because she wasn't too good with her.
---
Ignore the comments, I think she looks GREAT. Thank you for putting the effort into creating this to share with all of us
---
Only thing I‚Äôll say bad about the dude is that he clickbaits like no one else, and he does have a tendency too just call SWF, even if they all join at different times. Otherwise he seems like a cool dude.
---
To even the playing field?
---
Teammate: *pops ruin*
---
Other teammate: I‚Äôm gonna do what‚Äôs called a pro gamer move.
---
Toxic Neas, always flashlighting me when I‚Äôm right next to the hook
---
I mean good 0layer intentionally stay at low ranks because you ever tried to find a match at res ranks?
---
Besides having good survivors go against shitty killers teaches those killers how to beat survivors who know what their doing.
---
NOPE.  IT‚ÄôS JUST TOXIC.  TEABAGGING IS SIMPLY A BIG ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM A PRICK‚Äù SIGN.  YOU WANT TO OUTSMART THE KILLER?  THEN JUKE/DODGE/EVADE THEM.  I FAIL TO SEE HOW TEABAGGING AT THE END GATES OR HITTING A SURVIVOR ON A HOOK IS A VIABLE ‚ÄúPSYCH OUT‚Äù MIND GAME.
---
Modern consumerist brainwashing from a young age combined with people having a raging fervor to be seen as reasonable, mature and intelligent, which they think repeating the mantra of "companies need to make money stop being entitled" over and over and over will make them appear to be
---
Yes, that's what happend, but then they added the minimal amount of pallets and made it that if the map spawns and has less than the minimal amount, the minimum distance rule gets ignored. They even explained that on one of their dev streams
---
I've noticed with Pig if you get a survivor in between you and a jigsaw box you can see their outline regardless of if there is a wall or rock between you and the survivor. Seems to work regardless it they have a trap on or not, only noticed it within around 40 meters of the box.
---
This. If I'm being camped, I would at least want my teammates to do gens. It takes a while to die so it's a huge advantage to just get them done.
---
Bloodlust resets when you break or get hit by pallets
---
The \#1 thing that makes playing a serial killer simulator truly terrifying is the line of thinking "well this survivor is completely safe I'd better just go somewhere else"
---
Remember in Halloween when Laurie made Myers go to a different movie by sliding back and forth across a safe pallet for 15 minutes
---
Legion maining for now, can confirm, stops working at 11.
---
This is some good shit! hahahahaha
---
Have like 3 gateaus on Meg, it sucks because it's her first cycle bloodweb so I am unable to prestige her to get rid of that annoying bloodweb cap message, but definitely saving them for whenever the next BP hunt is. I think I have 10 on Ghostface and 8 on Bubba (and those will probably never be used rip.)
---
Wasn‚Äôt the killer bringing the Nea to the exit gate? Why would you flashlight him?
---
Shelter Woods: 
---
Balanced Landing: ....am I a joke to you?
---
I put my boots on one pickle at a time.
---
I like me a Killer who, when they see that they‚Äôre more skilled/dealing with lesser players decides to muck about with them :)
---
Had a Huntress a while back who started following the 4 of us and helping us find the generators, but if someone failed a skill check they‚Äôd cop a Hatchet to the back and get carried around a bit before she let them escape.
---
Was really refreshing to have the Killer be more friendly and one of my mates even got a message from them after, saying something along the lines of ‚ÄúGame wouldn‚Äôt let me repair gens or escape with ya‚Äôll :(‚Äú
---
Obviously most games there needs to be that competitiveness and true Hunter/Hunted feel but it‚Äôs a nice change of pace
---
Uh oh don't let him or one of his fans see this post, he might go on another Twitter rant about how toxic this subreddit is just because he gets called out on his bullshit here
---
Rank 12. I‚Äôm not even surprised. On console, many killers from rank 20 to rank 10 just face camp, especially when the season restarts and they‚Äôre trying to lazily get back to whatever rank they were before.
---
Did they announce the winners of the user designed skins yet?
---
My best friend is AMAZING at the game, I suck big time...i can't even look behind me without running straight to a wall. But lately I've managing to get good at running the killer around for 2 or 3 gens.   I started last year, it takes time and lot of practice....also is so much fun (if you ignore the hate messages lmao)
---
*touches soil* something awful happened here...
---
I got things to invent
---
I hate people that either use different words to save themselves from the ban or sending part of the words in different messages
---
You're still able to escape after the hatch has been closed, it's just more challenging and requires precise planning and timing. If the doors are spread far enough apart, follow the killer to one of the doors and when they leave to check the other one you usually have enough time to get it open. But if the doors are close enough to camp both at the same time then yeah.. you're screwed. But that's okay because you can try again next trial.
---
It‚Äôs an add on for the map. It lets the survivor mark a location and only other survivors can see it.
---
It happened to me twice, both times i finished buying a blood web node the exact moment the game started. Maby you did the same?
---
No fix in the game, just play it on hardmode
---
Theres an add on for the map that allows you to place them. They're markers for other players
---
I'm not sure how well known it is now, but pressing or spamming "try to escape" on hook so you wave your arms are (or were) universal sign that the killer is camping.
---
i thought he was just dumb ngl
---
How does it counter overcharge?
---
You want it to be fun and enjoyable by your standards and your standards imply that your enemy has to be a less try-hardig because that way is fun for you, and in this case he purposefully has to not follow his main objective which is to kill you.
---
The basic standard things in this game are that Survivors are suppose to escape, and Killers job is to stop them by killing them. And if one tries to win using game mechanics, that are allowed, there is nothing wrong in it.
---
OMG
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Imagine still using mom jokes lmao
---
I don‚Äôt think DS is toxic anymore. It can easily be countered by not tunneling which any person with some respect for this games health and other people won‚Äôt do it the first place. DS is a perk that isn‚Äôt meant for toxic people it‚Äôs meant to shit on toxic people who tunnel
---
See, that doesn't validate the memes though.
---
Game is balanced though to where a couple people playing in a SWF makes it an even game, as it‚Äôs advantage killer against a lobby of 4 solo players.
---
After a few hours you can just tell when somebody is a camper.
---
They don't like reality I guess
---
*gets pallet stunned* possibly a 4 man swf. This is gonna be a rough game, ruin went down pretty early. *Pallet stunned* possibly 4 man? What do you think guys? *goes on hill* balanced? Ohh no balanaced. You messed up, I get you here. *misses* BAssstard. Playing a weak killer aswell. And ruin went pretty early.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with iridescent heads? In my opinion the core of the problem is belt
---
Yeah, I like never being caught in a bad position. Dead Hard is good too, but doesn't help for instadowns.
---
Probably.
---
That's actually just what iridescent head does now
---
well me and my swf have the same name with toxic next to it because we simply are :). we just memed rank 1 billy with ebony and we made sure to tbag at the exit gate. gg ez baby killer
---
The thing about Tunneling is there‚Äôs a fine line.
---
If someone‚Äôs just been let off the hook and you start heading back and see the guy who just got hooked, no one is expecting you to just ignore that person and look for others. However if you are specifically hunting down that one person it‚Äôs really just not enjoyable for them.
---
It can just be really hard to tell which it is when you‚Äôre on the receiving end though
---
Why would ghostface ever use insidious lol
---
different survivors
---
Cute Squeals
---
Everyone wanted bun bun... we get this.
---
There always will be exceptions to the rule, but the reason all the good survivors are at low ranks is to have more fun killers.
---
Actually closing the hatch isn't necessarily a free kill if the survivor uses their brain.. unless oemga blink nurse of course, no counterplay for that
---
‚ÄúTea bagging should cause exhaustion‚Äù - Tru3talent
---
You're not wrong there, I just enjoy having fun every now and again
---
Not even what open handed does
---
Break the pallet, they‚Äôll get distance of course but you‚Äôll eliminate the problem pallet. The game wasn‚Äôt made to just hand the killer every kill like candy, it‚Äôs gonna take persistence regardless, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre called survivors and not victims
---
Dwight has never been toxic, he is the one we need to protectüò°
---
*hag traps dropped item*
---
If escaped multiple times after the killer closed the hatch, you have to wait for the killer to patrol
---
1 and quickly open it while he heads to the other, sometimes even partially working on it then hiding. You‚Äôre not gonna escape every time but theres still a chance
---
That‚Äôs my point. Good survivors want to have fun so they derank.
---
I always got this shitty error, it's very annoying
---
WAZZUUUUUUUUUUP
---
Myers is scary too but GF's feature is that he will get you marked if you just noticed him and he's in the middle of stalk it's already done . with myers he could've grabbed you but now you'll over your shoulders more
---
You just repeated what I wrote in the title just with other words ;)
---
Yeah it might be more powerful than 4 randoms but you can‚Äôt just take out the game mode swf friends all the sudden. I can‚Äôt tell you how many people will quit or play less and even spend less money on the game because swf is gone and honestly I am one of them. Not because I am toxic just because I love playing with my friends and having fun.
---
I had it happen twice, Michael and Ghostface, i think it happens if you try and leave while in a chase with the killer because everytime I've seen it happen the person who got caught was in a chase
---
We can repair gens, why not cars
---
His power is meh
---
It is one of the strongest defensive powers, but if you are not camping or going vs idiots you wont be too often in the situation to defend a hook
---
In a chase you most often get a faster down if you m1 the survivor twice.
---
BBQ is the onely real reason to get him
---
That was before, now that doesn't work is fucking dumb
---
Yesssss that's beautiful
---
:) Worry not.  You have passed the entity's test :)
---
It helps me play better :)
---
Correct if I'm wrong, because I just started playing last week, but wouldn't the hex have less of an impact because swf groups be more coordinated at removing them?
---
Thanks for posting this! &lt;3
---
LOL
---
Still waiting for that answer.....
---
I usually don't if I'm last alive. Figured I won't really be able to wiggle out most of the time and maybe I'll get lucky and get hatch for putting up no resistance.
---
my mom was graped dude it‚Äôs not funny :((((
---
Ok
---
Yo, man. You're like, totally entitled to your opinion. I'm sure you'll see even better comebacks in the future, my dude. Until then, go Spartans!
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. It doesn't make sense to me, honestly lol. If anything should be more expensive, it should be the DLC.
---
I agree in all the games I‚Äôve played on both survivor and killer, survivors have virtually no chance to escape if 3 are dead and 1 is left. Partly this is because they have to sneak around to avoid being caught, so they can‚Äôt move around as quickly, whereas the killer can go around normally.
---
You can‚Äôt put a timer on starting 1 or 2 gens by yourself though, I mean it‚Äôs certainly not going to be to the killers liking that‚Äôs for sure. It can‚Äôt be a couple minutes as it‚Äôs impossible vs any killer who‚Äôs patrolling gen to gen. I mean, would a 15 minute clock just to get an additional kill really be worth it?
---
Man with how bugged sounds are now, spine chill is an absolute essential
---
I didn‚Äôt say keys were always uncounterable. Please learn to read.
---
I‚Äôd support it
---
Do you play nurse/billy?
---
anti-consumer? You can buy most of the skins with game currency that is gained by leveling, it's not like EVERY cosmetic is exclusively sold for an auric cells. Only the better quality skins are locked behind the paywall, besides many good/great skins came during the events and you could grind for them.
---
Yeah, that's why i'm asking what he's talking about. Ruin isn't necessarily for SWF, it's just to slow the game down and not get genrushed in 3 minutes.
---
SWF groups will rush the gens through Ruin anyways. Someone will just say "I'll look for ruin" And the other 2-3 people can just work on gens while ruin is active in the meantime and they won't waste time.
---
Ruin is much less effective against good SWF groups imo, not to mention the good survivors who hit hex skillchecks 90% of the time.
---
I make everyone sad
---
Yeah, her toes are fucked but her pinky is straight zigzagged.
---
Hey, bro. Some humor isn't for everyone. I'm sure you'll do well in all your games and your friends can instead provide you with all the humor you'll ever need.

How to survive bird box
---
They will never buff all the other killers at once. The first thing is to deal with SWF, adding coms to other communication tools to solo survivors. That would make survivors stronger, but evenly stronger when not in SWF. From there, the Devs would need to buff all killers for balance.
---
The biggest issue with SWF is VoIP, its a shame there's no way for devs to blacklist such things because it would do alot to somewhat balance SWF
---
If you COULD read, you‚Äôd have notice i said in response to one of their comments ‚Äúif this were true, then keys have always been uncounterable.‚Äù This is not me stating keys are uncounterable, but rather, if their opinion about keys was true, then they have always been uncounterable. If, then statements don‚Äôt always denounce a belief or a truth. Please actually read before you make a comment in response.
---
Thanks for the input u/TheDankAutism756
---
Ruin, that gets found in the first 10 seconds of a game. Or Franklins that destroys a team‚Äôs strategy. Hmmmm.
---
Thank you

whenever survivors send me really toxic shit i almost always get really positive instead. "hey, you were really good!" "i'm glad you had fun!"
---
That‚Äôs the one that says pull 200 survivors into the dream state right? I‚Äôm pretty sure any time you convert any survivor it counts.
---
It was the glorious age of trapper when he can trap under hooked survivor. 
---
And for survivors side, there was several broken stuffs for them such as 20 sec cool down of Sprint Burst / 80% of Self Care healing speed / Several windows and pallets that made them became untouchable and etc.
---
And I still miss that old day tho lolz
---
Im referring to in general, I've heard him express surprise at people using Spine Chill at all, as if it's a shitty perk, when it basically shuts down stealth killers and forces them into basic m1ing without a potential free hit.
---
destroy a team strategy in which way exactly?
---
She requires a toe repair
---
Probably could work
---
Okay thanks
---
Trapper stuff wasn't that bad tbh today body blocker hag is even harder to counter than trap under a hook. And given how OP meg's perk was Trapper deserved to have some leverage
---

What did they say?

Where exactly is the horrible in DBD's monetization?
---
Can we just agree that we all want to play the game and actually win sometimes? We're all just using the tools thus game gives us so anything that isn't cheating or disconnecting is totally fine with me on both sides.
---
I am also curious to this
---
Only 2k points wtf
---
And if your a good killer you don't need noed.
---
At least she was "mmm so good so loose"
---
Susie is the cutest killer.
---
Some skin prices are kinda inconsistent too, ghostface yellows is like somewhere above 270, while legion is only 270, and huntress was around 130 I think? I haven't played in awhile so..
---
WGLF, Borrowed Time, We‚Äôll make it, and self care with a medkit is golden

I HIT SURVIVORS ON HOOK SOMETIMES TO STOP THE SCREAMING. I PLAY WITH HEADPHONES ON, MY GOD, SOME OF THE FEMALE VOICE ACTORS PUT THEIR HEART OUT INTO THAT SCREAM, CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM, BUT OH MY GOD,  SO LOUD
---
me drinking concentrated grape juice
---
Damn that hurts. I got it cuz I REFUSE to put points into that yellow aproned fat shit
---
We‚Äôll make it is bad and I stopped using self care not really worth it at higher ranks
---
My favorite thing to do is fake the pickup and then smack them, and then fake the pickup again and get a free down. Works almost always on toxic survivors. You could also run lightborn, franklins, or look at walls.
---
Oh of course that's true, but I absolutely gaurantee you that there will be a "majority pleaser" color, and the people behind these businesses know what palettes will sell more to the average person, despite the outliers.

There‚Äôs a lot more but it‚Äôs all the same thing slightly changed over and over, and most of it was flagged as spam and taken down

are you intentionally trying to farm gold or platinum from this sub? because it is working and i freaking love this.

Self care more for the efficiency of the Medkit, rather than use it to heal myself. It‚Äôs my ‚Äúfarm teammates for points‚Äù build
---
Shelter woods is the worst map for everyone. It‚Äôs so unenjoyable.
---
I mean I'd hardly call it a tragedy. She went from being some random human in a failing family to being a murderous, immortal spirit that gets to kill people forever. That's an upgrade in my eyes. Think about what would have happened if her father didn't go berserk, he's out of a job with tuition and hospital bills to pay, and the only money coming in now would have been Rin's. They likely would have ended up homeless, and it just would have been this giant depressing mess. I'll take blood and anger over tears and sadness any day.
---
The worst part are those big rocks that look like they might have a pallet at them, but you cant see until you are there.
---
saw this exact thing happen with ghostface last game, minus the hatch escape.. thats unreal \^\^
---
Auto could be so amazing if it had a +100% skillcheck chance, right now it's like "oh I had 2 seconds left to heal and got my Auto-skillcheck Yaaay"
---
Generally they do, sometimes they don't. But fast-entering a locker happens so quickly most of them got confused and circled the locker looking for me long enough for Head On to activate. I think they were expecting to either hear me or see me slow entering and it delayed them just enough.
---
I did still get nabbed a few times before it worked. I think it works better when you're ahead of them enough to round a corner, be out of sight and THEN do it. If they see you hop in the locker obviously Q&amp;Q is pointless.
---
Another build I had some fun with the other day is Q&amp;Q, Lithe &amp; Dance with Me. If you hear a killer coming you silently fast-vault off into the night with a speed boost and no scratch marks after the vault. That one worked VERY well.
---
im an innovator baby, changed the world
---
Which is exactly why BHVR should just be brave to make strong killers because
---
1. Killers have options in high ranks
---
2. Survivors get more variety and different outcomes
---
3. Nurse could finally be nerfed
---
4. Games would be more thrilling
---
5. Killers would be more interested to play because they know they can win
---
So it's a win on all fronts
---
first time i gave an award in 3 years, you deserve it man, i didn‚Äôt even esitate.

'cause gen rushing does not remove anyone from the game before the end.

Reminds me of "the binding of Isaac" and hey they both got adventures in the basement.
---
Sorry why is everyone saying he‚Äôs new at the game he‚Äôs a level 54.new to the game, no , new to being killer maybe.
---
Same.  I watch him more than anyone else, because despite his complaints, he *usually* has some validity behind them.  It's hard to spend that many years in red ranks and not know what you're talking about.
---
What did it cost?
---
And double pallets on each jungle gym
---
Oh yeah I forgot this existed. I think BHVR did too because holy smokes why does it even exist like that anymore.
---
I think it's intended that you aren't supposed to wiggle out in a normal scenario. If everyone's bodyblocking or the killer is taking too long then you might be able to.
---
I had a swf team bully me harder than I ever had in my life last night. I was going for adept wraith with no mori and they all had medkits with insta heals, DS, dead hard, etc. and teabagged/did gens in front of me/body blocked the hook and then all escaped. I was dying inside, but I knew an angry reaction was what they wanted. I stuck it through and just said gg at the end like I was unbothered.
---

Encouraging toxicity does harm the game, as I know many people who have quit the game because of it. Promoting the likes of AngryPug and Jendanise doesn't give them any more publicity than promoting StreamDad, Monto, ZubatLEL, HybridPanda, or even No0b3. The difference is these people foster a positive community and look to make the game fun for everyone while the likes of AngryPug and Jendanise just look to scream at Killer players because being loud and crass gets clicks. (No offence to the old Tyler1 but there's a reason he was so popular.)

This is such bullshit man.  I've watched hundreds of his videos over the years and one of the reasons I've always enjoyed watching him is because he specifically doesn't camp and very rarely tunnels.  Don't make shit up just because you don't like the guy.

Not true, unless the killer is running Insidious.  By definition, if the killer refuses to play the survivors all automatically get an iridescent Survival ranking.  If you all work on gens equally then you will all get silver or gold in that category as well.  Unless they are running Insidious you can just sit in the non-playing killer‚Äôs terror radius for a few minutes and you will max out evader.  Is it as efficient as chasing?  No, but if he killer refuses to play you can still score Iridescent in 2 categories and silver in 2 (benevolent will automatically be silver due to no hooks reducing the base score).
---
Meanwhile, if survivors refuse to play then hooks and sacrifices is capped at a bronze or silver score (bronze if one escapes, silver if they all die), brutality is capped at bronze or silver (8 hits maximum and no chase score), gatekeeper is capped at gold (since you can only farm up to 9 minutes before it cuts off and if you don‚Äôt kick gens it can‚Äôt bump your score up beyond that), and deviousness is capped at silver or bronze (silver for the 2500 points you get from ‚ÄúNo One Escaped‚Äù or ‚ÄúHatch Closed‚Äù, bronze if someone escapes).  That‚Äôs at max 3 silvers and a gold, much less than survivor non-participation even if the bloodpoint gain is obviously going to be higher.
---
It's really hard to have fun when I'm matched with 2 rank 20s, and a purple rank killer. I swear you should be able to see the other survivors rank in the lobby so I dont have to play with people who literally get me killed
---
Since you‚Äôre a killer main, think about all the things you use to catch survivors that mess up. Avoid doing that
---
oh man oh god this is the best, is it all done and ready yet?
---
Alot of these killers wnd loops just as fast as nurse does, she just also has mobility on her side so she can find survivors faster and catch them off gaurd better. But if a full health survivor is in a jungle gym against a good nurse or a good clown or a good huntress id argue that the loop will last pretty much just as long. Nurse may be shorter by a second or two. And she is punished the heaviest for making a mistake by far. 
---
If you want to argue that some of her addons are a-little too power-full sure i agree they need some adjusting. But a nurse with zero addons is powerful yes but not broken. 
---
Cause if you want to argue ‚Äúbroken killers and throw addons into the mix‚Äù what about tombstone myers? He has the potential to completely end the game after only finding everyone once or twice. Or huntress with iridescent ax heads. Those abilities are certainly incredibly powerful
---
Tbh Tru3 is probably one of the most trusted streamers in my opinion in what he says. His points on balancing have always seemed fair and if he were on the balancing team at BHVR this game would be in a better state. Most people who shit talk about him are just those who can‚Äôt provide proper facts or evidence for their claim and continue to argue with him.
---
I have good days and bad days. Today I am trash.

I did try a version with the eyebrows drawn on but I took them back out because I felt it made the joke less effective than having the reader imagine that he's got the angry eyebrows hidden under his mask. But that's just specifically for this joke, if I reuse this meme I'll probably put the eyebrows back on. Or make it with a different killer. Tempted to make it with spirit and she's making a crazy different face each panel :d
---
Here's a concept, not everyone enjoys the same things as you do. People enjoy their streams, and those people's opinion's are valid as the rest of us. Just because you feel this way, doesn't mean many others do. It's a videogame with trolling (toxicity the new word), god forbid! Not like it hasn't been around since online multiplayer has been a thing, hell playing Goldeneye on the 64 with friends had the same results. Bitch all you want about pug, but he is genuinely really good at survivor. They're not screaming at the killer, they're screaming at a screen in the their own home. So the killer really receives none of it. Maybe in post chat, but I personally exit out at the end of matches, if you stick around you're probably looking for a reaction yourself. Why do you let what someone else does on their stream consume you in any negative way?
---
He‚Äôs actually done a pretty good about the no balance talk rule. The only time he broke the rule was talking about one of the really bad loops in iron works I believe.
---
Honestly his haters pretty much fall into 2 categories.  
---
Some killers hate him because he accurately acknowledges NOED to be a crutch used by less than skilled players.
---
Some survivors hate him because he accurately acknowledges the massive benefits a SWF group has and those that exclusively boost rank by playing SWF don't like hearing this and do what they can to downplay the benefits.
---
"don't buy it"
---
OP is saying it needs to be cheaper
---
It'll be like the New Legion. A killer not worth playing.
---
Freddy will finally be.. Fun‚Ñ¢.

Ah, but Hope over Adrenaline lets you keep Dead Hard. It also makes saves/ endgame objectives easier, and is a direct counter to NOED's speed buff
---
I was away from the game fore a week or two.. didn't knew when it happened
---
I would say this is poking fun, but the title seems to point other wise. If the title was different than yeah I‚Äôd think this was funny cause there‚Äôs truth to it.
---
I dunno, if they made it proximity based, people would still use Discord and shit.  I like playing SWF myself, even though me and my friends aren't that great at the game so the killer probably rarely notices.  But even as a killer, I'm fine with SWF sometimes.  Either take the challenge or eat my loss and learn.
---
Fortune 500 ‚Äòfore you kissed a girl!
---
not cometely true, while um a pretty good killer, im still far from the best, i run noed when i 1: dont have any good perks for the killer or 2:am playing a baf killer such as freddy, but even the best killer will still have matches were noed would be good

McLean talked about why this happens on stream a week or two ago. Essentially, in order to provide a more cohesive experience, the game will show you the beginning of an animation before it is fully confirmed that that action will actually happen in game. This is to prevent you from seeing something like a grab animation after the survivor has fully cleared the window, giving a jarring visual experience. What happens is the game starts the animation, then when it runs the check to confirm that its a grab and it fails, it stops it because it didn't finish. Or something like that, super weird.
---
Well i'd say my luck is pretty shit, so i get hit after the animations, get this kind of killers and i'm often the person who's being hooked. Well thanks anyway :)

Get three other friends to play with you and communicate with each other. You'll make red ranks easily.
---
It's way more than decent, it's also a really hard counter to sloppy butcher.
---
Looks great! That embroidery is impressive af
---
The Halloween event where you had to harvest nectar from those plants?
---
This just happened to me. :/. I was trying out clown for the first time and it was hell.
---
.......... omg i am so sorry! i meant for a skin.... i am so sorry omg
---
Doesn't Xbox have anyway to capture screenshots?
---
Ah that sucks, but if you are looking to play more Plague, I would advise trying to aim your puke where the survivor is going rather than where they are. You'll land many more hits than way, and the vomit is a series of orb shaped projectiles too, which is why you can see a connecting stream sometimes never make them sick.
---
But lmao, Jane mad
---
oh ok!
---
Are you playing on PC or console? I have the game both on PC and PS4. DM me and we can play together so you can learn the basics
---
Nobody forces you to buy a skin, all games have overpriced skins
---
Happened to me against a leigon and i couldn‚Äôt mend the whole game it was horrifing
---
Yes one of my most wanted killers with a Shining chapter with an Overlook Hotel map with indoor and outdoor maze section.
---
I‚Äôve actually seen this same glitch in game
---
PS4 Streamers are lol.  I swear I'll be facecamped by some trashcan with gens up and then afterwards when I look at their profile it'll say follow me on twitch with their channel.  Like how is this content bro lol.  Who the fuck wants to watch you trashcamp on stream?
---
Funny, new legion is better than before.
---
Sometimes it goes off when I don‚Äôt see anyone, other times I could be dead staring at and chasing a survivor and it won‚Äôt play
---
Sir I don't think this how you use this meme format
---
Batteries are the best addon a flashlight can have
---
[Me in this thread](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/392/685/a9c.png)
---
STOP FUCKING DOING THE GEN I AM DOING WHEN THE RUIN HEX IS ON. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU NOT SEE THAT IT IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE?
---
AND STOP FUCKING BEGGING TO BE HEALED. HELP ME WITH THIS FUCKING GEN FIRST (DIFFERENT GAME, NO HEX RUIN IN THIS ONE). THE KILLER WANTS YOU TO SPEND HALF THE GAME HEALING.
---
Green battery and low amp filament gives the highest usage but I personally have gotten used to the intense hallogen timing so I use green battery and intense hallogen btw make sure green battery is the first add on
---
Yeah
---
Is that why you only got 20 upvotes? Self proclaimed  better meme kek
---
Bond is in my top 3 perks, but it is also a curse because when you've been running a killer for a solid 3 minutes and you've seen a Claudette crouched by a tire the entire time you want to kill her yourself.
---
If you thought that was a bad insult one time I told someone who was messaging me salt to go suck a big toe.
---
Explain
---
Again, op is saying they need to make it cheaper, that already know they aren't forced.
---
Not all games have overpriced skins, and even if they did that's doesn't justify selling overpriced skins
---
Ahhh it is refreshing to see another person on this sub that plays fair and still fucks up survivors.  
---
This place is usually all KILLER IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT CAMP AND TUNNEL.  NERF SURVIVOR RAWR.
---
Well i definitely didn't know that, will try it in game. Thanks
---
I mean it kinda pays for us keeping licensed killers, so I'm okay with the game not doing a Friday the 13th.
---
You can purchase those cosmetics and any newer event cosmetics from the store with auric cells I believe. Unfortunately I don't think you can buy them with shards.
---
I fucking love your name
---
Damn, Doctor buff is insane
---
Just learn the mind games
---
Some colors are more popular, yeah.
---
That‚Äôs alright thank you!
---
Yeah, my wife and I were just talking about how expensive a single skin is. I don't want it to be free, but $10 is way too much for 1 skin.
---
Most of the characters are free or can be bought with game currency, skins are not mandatory and if you can't afford them just pass
---
That happens to me so often. Claudette is probably hiding in the grass.
---
MAGA 2020
---
oh no i never said mine was *better,* this is definitely put together better than mine. i meant worse as in how much of a stretch it is.
---
Pressing the button for a skill check when you don't have a skill check will consume the medkit and use the instant heal. Hitting skill checks normally won't.
---
yeah last night when i was banging your mom lol
---
I think op has a point , I'd expect cosmetics to be equivalent to a dlc or less.
---
And 5 bucks for pants , 20$ + for two sets? It's hard to value cosmetics to other cosmetics like the headcase had all these cool prices and was less than 2$ and I only bought Dwight's fedora which was 5$.
---
I think they should up the auric cells bundled or let me buy a year pass for 30-40$ that gives me all the years dlc , a monthly auric cell budget and battle pass access.
---
I never mentioned characters, they are well priced. It however does not make sense that skins cost more than characters and dlcs
---
Again, I know they aren't mandatory but asking for them to be cheaper does not harm anyone.
---
It's just something everyone does and thus can relate to, the latency is not noticeable if you'd give it a try you'd see for yourself
---
You can use the med-kit on yourself but make sure you also bring an add-on that adds extra charges if you want to be optimal about it and save the insta-heal till you absolutely need it.
---
Noice
---
Or they always run an ebony mori and actually think they are good lol I dont see the point but you do you
---
&gt; saying "we're" like everyone on reddit is the same as you.
---
He used we're because Tru calls everyone on reddit a "reddit drone".
---
No. Only certain games have that cross-play function.
---
You can use it to insta heal one or 2 health states if you press L1 on console and for PC I have no clue and the med kit can be used to heal yourself then instaheal but it drains the med kit faster I believe or makes it so you get less out of it. Basically you can heal with the med kit and still instaheal also the Syringe is only good on downed teammates as it heals them fully while styptic is meant for more personal use
---
I don‚Äôt think DBD is supported by Play Anywhere.
---
I don't think this game will be held up in a court case anytime soon. Whether we buy or not that wouldn't change it if it was held in court due to copyrights and trademark issues. Just saying it is a bad comparison.
---
Before you get your pitchfork I have bought 5 or 6 cosmetics and I paid for every chapter and paragraph with money.
---
It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt understand that they have to pay someone to design these skins.
---
That's why the skins are overpriced, because you don't need to pay for most of the characters, skins are just a way to support the devs and keep going with new releases and free content
---
Not for facecamping though lol
---
This is the most logical reason my brain is comfortable with lol. I buy all mine with real money to support them and this makes perfect sense as to why I don't mind paying it.
---
survivor has to sprint quite close to you without anything breaking the LoS
---
Unfortunately those kinds of things do carry their rank and I see it all the time. I play solo and maybe they‚Äôll get away with those tactics more easily against solo players.
---
'there should be a negative effect for playing video games with friends' yeah ok buddy
---
i agree lol
---
Actually anything less than a pip is a loss and with how they did the emblems at the moment even most games with 3 kills is either a depip or blackpip, playing at red ranks and it gets infuriating to know that "Hey i managed to get 3, and maybe even a hook or two on the guy that escaped (good on him for managing it) but then to go to the lobby screen and see either a black pip or depip is just depressing...
---
yep he is ready :3
---
&gt;facing SWF fun
---
Yea with insta saw billy
---
This
---
And the killer has Remember Me + Brutal Strength
---
Flair does not check out, Spirit.
---
What a failed bait attempt
---
Make it join the rank of the killer that matches the the highest ranked survivor in your party. So it‚Äôs a rank 15s fault for going with a rank 2, allowing them to face proper players, and allowing it to be fair for the killer for once, seeing that it‚Äôs a 1v4
---
I have had this happen as killer. Felt bad for the guy, and I already closed hatch and he died. Got a clip of it on my twitch tho.
---
They get frustrated I guess
---
I think BHVR is finally figuring out that it's okay to make Killers stronger because they're starting to realize that to do that, Killers need some sort of mobility, or something to compensate for the lack of mobility. All of the high tier Killers have mobility options - i.e., Spirit, Billy, Nurse - while the low tier Killers don't. Reworking the low tier Killers like Clown and Trapper should be the next step, imo.
---
I think you‚Äôre right. But I‚Äôll upvote for the effort
---
They were refering to the release selection of skins, pretty sure.
---
That face when the Survivors teabag you at the exit gate and still get the hatch
---
Nope, Freddy main, I have 2000 hours in the game, and 700 of those are on Freddy, recently I've been playing a lot of Ghostface tho.
---
Survivor main
---
Yeah, I've heard that shit is busted.
---
The question is why is this on r/deadbydaylight
---
Yup, I think you have to sacrifice 25 of each of the characters as Leatherface.
---
The faces are available for Dwight, Meg, Claudette or Jake.
---
So sacrificing 25 Dwights would get you the Dwight face, sacrificing 25 Claudettes would get you the Claudette face, etc..
---
Thats why they're more expensive...They're not characters or dlcs they're optional cosmetics that can be any price.
---
Making characters $10 a piece and dlc bundles $15 while making these cosmetics $5 would piss people off way more.
---
You didn't say he was using it for facecamping though lol
---
If the gates wouldn‚Äôt spawn on the same side of the map I‚Äôd like the EGC. Can‚Äôt tell you how many times the gates spawn literally next to each other on the same side of the map, or adjacent in such a way the killer can stand at one gate while looking at the other.
---
Regardless of whether or not you think the survivor should have the win, it‚Äôs futile at that point and as a solo survivor I tend to go for hatch escapes because I can‚Äôt always rely on my team to be good and efficient.
---
I wasnt even mad at you,  chill the fuck out, I'm not saying they will be held in a court case,  I'm saying that they do have to renew their licensing.  Also I never even said you didn't purchase cosmetics, I have and I'm sure everyone pretty much has. So chill, jesus.
---
You forgot Selfcare
---
Sacrifice 25 of either Meg, Dwight, Jake, or Claudette for their respective masks.
---
I'm not sure, I'm a P3 Claudette and I've just been juking killers, trying to practice for an upcoming tournament I'm participating in.
---
I just realized banana wasn't the only word which has the same writting on portuguese (my native language). Observe is written the same in both languages with the same meaning. I know, random comment right?
---
You‚Äôd have to sacrifice another survivor to get him off the hook usually the person with the least amount of hooks
---
I think making purple skins 5$ would not be so bad
---
dc after the game starts too to waste the offering, what an asshole you are
---
Let's hope they did. Ghostface is alright the "hotfix" was kinda unnecessary, Plague got nerfed for no reason and Freddy took FOREVER. I still have faith, as long as they give the M1s (Trapper, Doctor, LF, Clown) at least a decent amount of QOL changes.
---
If you're talking about farming the afk killer for evader, the killer can do the same. Deviousness is a little killer dependant true, but you can indefinitely spam them all and hit 8k, with the lethal powers just juggle the survivor to pick them up from dying state yourself. In turn you will also max out the chase and hit scoring events, really the only category you will have trouble maxing is devout/sacrifice assuming they all die first hook.
---
Nothing is stopping you from shocking an afk survivor endlessly, or constantly frenzy stabbing them, stalking them, surprise attacking them, chainsawing them, puking on them and the surrounding environment and so on.
---
Yea you won't double pip, but neither will a survivor against an afk killer, also bold of you to assume the survivors will somehow all get even lightbringer/objective without coordinating.
---
So if you put in the time which isn't worth it I agree, you can get 26kish BP and 2 iri emblems, 1 gold, and 1 bronze. Since you're "winning" every chase fast and spamming your power.
---
So what? Do you get anything for reaching top rank? I remember killers used to complain it was hard to get matches at high ranks or the survivors were 'toxic' so they would just de-rank themselves on purpose. Isn't rank just a method of matching you to players who more closely meet your skill level. You not entitled to top rank, you have to earn it, you know . . . 'get gud' as they say.
---
Shortest kinky story in history.
---
This is reddit and I was trying to prevent an argument by explaining I support the game how it is. This game does not have licensing issues at all. Do you know what's going on with the Friday 13th franchise because it really in like comparing baseball to an apple.
---
Anyone have the template for this meme
---
They'd have to blacklist steam for that, it has built-in voice chat.
---
It's really not an issue. If the survivors are good on their own, voice chat won't make that much of a difference. They'll all know what to do.
---
4 great solo players will stomp just like 4 great swf players, they'll just be more efficient.
---
And here i am brainwashed
---
Really the rework (legion) was very necessary but its current state ... it is very bad
---
I'm sorry but there's just no excuse I can find for pricing cosmetics 10$. Optional or not
---
Ah ha ha that was hilarious man
---
And you are what represents half of the toxic community
---
i‚Äôll try it thank u!
---
You'd get exhausted when trying to loop huntress around low structures and crouching when you think she's gonna throw a hatchet at you.
---
Ok so I can heal myself with it and press the skill check button whenever I wanna insta-heal is that the same for teammates or does it automatically apply it when I go to heal a teammate
---
Need to make it so instead of the eyebrows going in to make them look mad they need to be tilted out with an O face to make them look defeated?  
---
I don't know why i'm putting this here.
---
Yes you do, you have no creativity and was hoping someone could use this idea for good.
---
You are right.  Sigh.
---
Featherweight and dead hard. Dead hard preemptively not when they strike. Use it to make it to the pallet or window to further bridge your gap. 
---
Also if trapdaddy you can dead hard right over their traps. In some cases you can lose the trapper by doing that. They may call you a cheater after the game but all it did was negate damage while you stepped over.
---
when is the rework coming out
---
your loins are in your body
---
There's a band called 'Xavlegbmaofffassssitimiwoamndutroabcwapwaelippohfffx'  
---
It's an acronym, the full band's name is:
---
'Acidic vaginal liquid explosion generated by mass amounts of filth faecal fisting and sadistic septic syphilic sodomy inside the infected maggot infested womb of a molested nun dying under the roof of a burning church while a priest watches and ejaculates in immense perverse pleasure over his first fresh fetus.'
---
And their logo is full of tree branches
---
Where the fuck is my Myers at?
---
I'm not saying legion is perfect but the concept for their power is there, they can apply good pressure and keep everyone injured or make them waste time mending. The cooldowns and recovery is just a tad to punishing. Witg a few number tweaks and add-on changes legion can be solid.
---
Lol my downvote button works too while we don't argue. You are petty
---
Yeah that's wack. I'd rather it not tantalize me with a grab and not give it to me.
---
i know thanks i came up with it on my own joke owned by : IridescentIsaac ahahahaha up top down low ahahahaha too slow
---
I mean if you only like stomping and not using your brain at all, then yeah.
---
Why even play a multiplayer game at that point?
---
r/twentycharacterlimit
---
So what if they face camp? Bring borrowed, ds , adrenaline, mom, kindred, insta heal, swf, body block. That's what I always do to camping killers. Worse case scenario do gens and leave.
---
And then there‚Äôs the hillbilly of the gaming industry, fortnite w/ $20 skins
---
If your gonna tryhard with your little SWF group then I'm gonna tryhard as a killer
---
It's the same for both: just press the skill check button when you want to use the add-on.
---
This is gonna become a meme, just like Myers staring from the stairs on haddonfield.
---
And save the best for last + play with your food
---
Idk why people think you can't play stuff that isn't billy/nurse/spirit at higher ranks.
---
I see some killers at higher ranks maining Wraith/Pig/LF and some of them even don't use Ruin.
---
Kudos to you for playing the fedora man, hope you'll like his rework mate.
---
It‚Äôs a stupid idea so you shouldn‚Äôt.
---
They arnt greedy and break there promises all the time, they understand how to balance the game equal to make both sides fun and challenging at the same time and the game s FLAWLESS without any bugs or glitches or mistakes, the completely enforce there owner rules by banning players who disconnect and are toxic and abusive to make the game and its community a better place. **/S**
---
Except it's not really 4% anymore, between slippery meat, up the ante, deliverance, luck offerings, etc, that 4% can be as high as 100% (with deliverance) or just over 88% (without deliverance). If it was truly 4% maybe then there'd be a reason to respect it but with as many options to Kobe as there is I'm gonna have to say no to respecting it.
---
If they made them a bit cheaper id actually argue that more people would buy it and they'd get more support/money. I mean making it a bit cheaper wouldn't hurt a lot. 10$ for a cosmetic in a priced game is pretty insane
---
Oiinnk
---
Dont know. They should've been matched with a Rank 6-8 killer
---
I still say the best approach as a DbD fan is for people to not get on too high a horse when talking about companies like EA or Activision/Blizzard: their monetization style is far less different from BHVR than many want to admit
---
The game definitely has a steep cost for characters when you decide to use in-game currency, for example, which does definitely create P2W implications, because many perks are trapped behind either the Shrine or, more commonly, the characters themselves. And it takes roughly 40-50 levels to get enoughiridescent shards to unlock one unlicensed character.
---
I think people who have hundreds or thousands of hours in this game tend to forget that if it takes hundreds or thousands of hours to unlock stuff and you still have stuff to unlock, you're playing a very grindy, very much P2W game - and I think people also tend to forget the steep iridescent shard cost as well, which is what really cinches it
---
The skins are one thing, but this game has also never been 'cosmetic-only monetization', either. I recently got my friend into the game, and I actually kind of lamented the fact that if he doesn't want to get suckered into microtransactions, he'll never be able to play half the roster, and he'll certainly never be able to unlock all the teachable perks he wants to play the way he wants to play, because the game makes you budget iridescents that take forever to get in the most roundabout way just so you can continue to grind
---
Nice, this is a change for the better. More shirtless David's is what the world needs :)
---
What is that 5 year old argument, as if i acted like i couldn't act aggressive myself. Also it wasn't a contradiction you fucking moron, it was hypocrisy. Second stop deflecting any criticism you receive, It's not a coincidence everyone on this post thinks you're wrong put down your little bubble, enough with this martyrdom act. if your too fucking stupid to process why people think you're wrong and being pathetic that's fine, doubling down on this waste of time post is another thing. " Learn. To. Read." the only fucking reason people are replying to your post is because they are reading the dumb shit you are sharing you cro-magnon.
---
"Please don't be a mori, please don't be a mori, please don't be a mori!"
---
Can relate on a spiritual level. I just had to be out of town when Alert was on the Shrine.. feels bad man.
---
Cat n mouse/tag varient gameplay has been around this long yes
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a few days but ranks reset every once in a while (I forgot how often). If it‚Äôs not time for rank reset, message technical support with the details they need and they‚Äôll help you. I once lost 5 levels in one character and I was awarded blood points back.
---
I can't fucking wait for rank reset. I despise red ranks
---
This is the notification that I want to see. Is there a specific time it‚Äôs supposed to start?
---
But he wasn't rude lol
---
Man
---
If only I could actually play killer, it would be nice.
---
Tru3Ta1ent seems to think he knows game balance better than developers who have taken feedback from both sides and aim to make the game more fun for everyone.  People have more fun with their buddies, and punishing them for that will make them upset.
---
It‚Äôs only been up for six hours lol
---
Don't buy it I guess?
---
Yagioterogoth? Yeah, these guys rule.
---
Repost #37 of this meme.
---
So no real change. It was always situational, some games it comes in clutch, some games you never get to use it. Sound op to me /s
---
yeah because you're a good example of a cringe guy. tru3 is based and untouchable
---
If there is one generator left with two survivors, I'll try to survive and struggle if hooked. Still a chance for both of us. 
---
If there is 2+ generators left, I'll just sacrifice myself on hook so the other can get the hatch. 
---
If I am constantly get slugged more than once while the killer goes to look for the other survivor, I'll DC.
---
Why do you assume playing with friends means you are tryharding?
---
If they all have toolboxes and instaheals and key and they send you to haddonfield with balanced landing, then fair enough. But otherwise they might just be wanting to have fun with friends.
---
i want the good old days back, when you get 4 brand new parts that all spawn by their separate gen, literally 10 sec after game started 4 gens would be done.
---
I normally wouldn't support something like this but Haddonfield can go fuck itself
---
Nice!! Its 'Observa', in spanish ;)
---
It isn't fair. Being able to DC is not a game mechanic and players should not treat it as such.
---
You completely butchered this format.
---
Because they almost always tryhard it's very rare they dont
---
The optional purchase which has no weight on gameplay needs to be cheaper?
---
That's gen rushing. When I only played survivor before I knew what bnp were I used to be so confused when 3 gens pop in 30 seconds lol. I just hate how people use it now. It's not gen rushing now it's just poor map control.
---
Well that was an emotional roller coaster
---
SWF Groups should face higher tier killers , I just bought the game less than a week and they destroy me while iam rank 12
---
That‚Äôs a smart play to make but Survivor mains will come in here and tell you that you need to play bad on purpose so that the survivors will have fun
---
But this is the same for survivors too. If anything, it's worse because for survivors a lot of it is out of your control and is dependent on how good your team is and if the killer is a jerk or not. It gets hard as fuck to even get a black pip as a survivor in higher ranks.
---
I literally learned how to play this game with Freddy, here's hoping he can be the nightmare we need AND DESERVE!
---
Then I guess you've had some worse experiences than I have, I really like going vs swf coz they are the most likely survivors to meme and derp around with head on/etc.
---
Except the fact that hatch is the deviation making it the free escape instead of the "free kill" considering the fact that once the hatch is closed the game returns to normal.
---
That's like saying anything that is a deviation could be compared to anything normal
---
Okay thanks alot, ill ask them!
---
Honestly pathetic.
---
I couldnt see him.  Freddy was in the way.
---
I honestly believe it's fine. There should just be an indicator as to who is in a SWF. Like in Overwatch where there is a dash mark between people who are in a party.
---
Would be nice if it got cheaper. 10$ for a skin is insane considering the fact that dbd is also not free
---
I have clothes at home. They're perfectly fine. Good quality. If im out and I see clothes I like but I find them too expensive, I don't go to the counter and tell them they need to price them differently. I just don't buy them. Damn some of you are so entitled. Don't buy the micro transactions that are entirely cosmetic if you think they're too expensive. If everyone who thinks they're too expensive doesn't buy them, BHVR will notice not many people buying their $10 cosmetic and take that into account when pricing future cosmetics.
---
He's pretty bad but the worst is Jeff
---
Batteries are the best. Always run at least one of them
---
Well that's like, your opinion man
---
Had that exact game with hillbilly downed 1 like flys around shit trynna pick him back up doened all 4 of them lol 1 by 1 I hook em and just stand and look at them lmaoooo best game ever
---
I play literally everyone, everyone is viable and fun if you know what you‚Äôre doing.
---
Alot of people dont stay on Reddit 24/7 like you lol
---
I never upvoted a post so fast.
---
I mean... his name is no haddonfield
---
And infinite loops without entity blocking and more pallets the corn on the fields !
---
All streamers are a taboo subject though. They all have issues.
---
N00b3 had drama with his ex
---
Jen can‚Äôt handle not winning 
---
ScottJund needs to focus more on his health then this game, he deserves it
---
Tru3 clickbaits to hell
---
They all have problems. But honestly their mistakes and issues are not enough to hate them for. Tru3 is who helped me climb out of the entitled survivor phase and helped me play killer better. And ScottJund helped me get even better. N00b3, Geistra, and Jen help me stay decent at survivor. None of them are perfect because no human is perfect but I love them all.
---
Oooo, thanks for sharing!
---
*laughs in playstation*
---
Its gotten to a point where its legit masochistic, i saw tru3 and many other streamers playing killer playing very tough games and the best they got was a safety pip ,not to mention that sometimes they depip with 3k's.
---
Meanwhile ive seen experienced survivors do their fucking worst and they get a safety and in case they actually play somewhat well, a pip or a double pip is nearly guaranteed. I also never said that i was entitled to kills, stop putting words in my mouth, best of all dbd isnt even about skill if you play a casual m1 killer it's about survivors being shit or making mistakes. Im sure you know the top 3 killers that do fairly well against decent survivors and FOR ONCE feel like the power role and even then it's not always the case.
---
Now then as a killer who doesnt want to play the only 3 good killers you know, i will as they say "fuck off" to your "get gud".
---
I know that happy clown hasn't finished making some of their icons yet, when they finish will you make an update?
---
I will summon this up real quickly for you, i can see in the future ! 
---
They rework him, suvivor start a outcry again, they nerf him into the ground and he is now worst then before, the end. 
---
Also John dont eat that watermelon !
---
I had a discord mod for the DBD discord DC for their swf mate to get the hatch and they said it was a legit game strategy and they wouldn't get banned for anything.
---
Look whos shittin in the tall grass
---
I am still dissapointed in myself for buying Pizza Delivery Boy Dwight
---
Tunneling is hitting the Survivor that just got unhooked or continually going for just that person and ignoring everyone else and respecting the 4%(Survivors unhooking themselves) is just allowing the Survivor to live for now and go after someone else.
---
And some teams faced higher rank killers and got destroyed themselves.
---
New players play with friends too, it's not restricted to experienced players.
---
Plus there is only so much being in a swf can help you with, if the players themselves aren't too good, they won't last much longer than they would have outside of their team.
---
I sense  pretty big inferiority complex vibes coming from you
---
Tunneling is basically just focusing on one survivor. Like if a survivor gets unhooked half way across the map and you instantly turn around to go after him again that is tunneling. Sometimes tunneling is a smart play to make and sometimes it‚Äôs a douche move. 
---
When you try to unhook yourself you have a 4% chance to do it, so respecting the 4% means to let someone go if they unhook themselves. It‚Äôs a pretty dumb rule imo and if you want to survive the killer you should outplay them and escape, not press a button and get lucky
---
It's pretty scummy be ause essentially you're using their toxic farming troll of a teamate to spoonfeed you kills.  It isn't the person on the hooks fault their teamate is a farming scumbag yet you punish them for their teamates play.  They are defenseless in the situation and they can't do anything to prevent themselves from being unhooked.  I 100% switch targets to Farmer Dan in that scenario because that playstyle is beyond toxic and should be punished.  Also I consider myself to be a good killer and don't need a teamate to feed me my downs.
---
Wraith's are bad. Even when he's invisible in the Spirit World, his footsteps give him away even before he uses the bell. No add-ons fix this or help.
---
did you just force me to pronounce hesitate with a silent h
---
I feel that's mostly because they have to play those killers to stay around those ranks. It's more a problem with the game then the killers, but at least they don't tunnel and camp
---
Text posts get no attention compared to M E M E S
---
For M1 Killers I definitely do. I always find it gives me much needed momentum with them.
---
yep
---
Ok I think that'd play well with a spirit version with her random crazy face different in each panel
---
Yeah it only cost humanity nearly 8 centuries and \~200 million lives. No biggie.
---
ps: There is a chance that y.pestis bacteria could develop drug resistance and haunt the world again. There have been case reports about it in recent past.
---
They don‚Äôt realize that one side isn‚Äôt gonna have fun regardless, and dying is something that should happen to you just like escaping
---
The original normal version or you want my beautiful drawn trapper version without words?
---
Leatherface will likely get his Tuxedo and stitched mask from Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2, since that movie is canon to how he is in DBD. Award Winning Chili is in the movie, and he is called Bubba in that film only.
---
No, it‚Äôs not a flaw with the game. What happens is that people pick up overpowered characters and get to really high ranks without much actual skill and then they can only keep that rank by continuing to use those characters. I know plenty of killer mains that can keep rank 1 with wraith, huntress, clown, trapper, hag, doctor, etc because they are good at the game. I‚Äôve been a victim to this as well. The first time I hit rank one on killer was with pre nerf legion and I hate myself for doing that. Characters like nurse and spirit are making people think they belong in red ranks when they really don‚Äôt.

---
Most of the time I‚Äôm not dealing with farmers and even when I do I just show mercy and let the poor farmed fella run off to start anew after I down the farming bastard and hook them instead.
---
Also, tunneling is not reportable offense. Deal with it. I never complain about anything really, if the killer tunnels me I blame my team (I blame the other survivors for getting the Hooked guy killed, not the Hooked guy. I have matches like that but I don‚Äôt blame the killer, he won strategically. What am I supposed to do let him get the hell away? The killer is a pack of wolves, the survivors are a herd, you always go for the weakest dinner)
---
if it isn‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs one hell of a coincidence
---
ironic
---
Cus he calls it like it is and has shown that shit is busted and angry people from either side dont like that. If they would listen to him about balance the game would be in a much better place but instead he and a few other legit people get straight ignored and we get absolute garbage content or reworks. Yeah he sounds bitter and is angry a lot but he has been playing this game for years and the same core issues are still prevalent. That would ruin anyone's disposition.
---
Without a doubt, its a shame Leatherface is so mediocre when the entire game's gameplay is kinda based off his movie
---
Is the beta available for people to try?
---
Why do I hear a puppy barking ?
---
are those the new charms hanging from david?
---
Lol absolutely I would have been content if like 10 people enjoyed my meme enough to upvote, all the rest is just gravy
---
Survivors have a 4% chance to 'kobe' themselves off of a hook. Respect the 4% basically means to not go after a someone who has just unhooked themselves. This is a stupid rule IMO, and one that you dont have to follow.
---
Remember, it's a 4% chance for them to get off the hook, not a 4% to get away.
---
Who the fuck is down voting this?
---
&gt; If you're having too much of an easy time it means you far outskill the survivors. Therefore the game is not a challenge. T
---
So far 100% right.
---
&gt; Therefore winning that game shouldn't mean that your skill improved.
---
Doesn't really matter if you "improved" or not. What it means is you are very strong for the rank you currently are at.
---
&gt;  Not pipping when playing against players with lesser skill is fine. That's how most pvp games work.
---
I don't know any Pvp games that works this way. Pretty much every single competitive game i know other than DBD, if you just dominate people at your rank, you will rapidly rank up.
---
Lol you started off okay but then your next paragraph you simply double down on using their teamates yo net you your kills.  Instead of playing like a trashcan try this.  Hit the would be farmer.  He farms.  Your wipe animation completes and you down them before they can get 5 feet away from the hook.  Congratulations!  You kept a body on a hook, got more bps and emblem credit for hooking a different person and punished a toxic troll survivor.  You acting like you need to work with farmers and simply redown the victim is absurd.  And I am far from a survivor main.  It's the killer side of my play that thinks people that play like you as killer make us all look like rank 20 garbage.
---
&gt;  I know some of it was implemented to put a damper on things like face camping and whatnot
---
And tbh if your face camping someone, you are unlikely to get a 4K anyways lol
---
Perk bm oof

Reddit is cancer and I wish I could not use it but there is literally no where else to get the feel for a community or be on top of news like this website. Not even the forums on most games work well. So yeah man you posting shit like this is just proving his point.
---
I also play on ps4 and got it free, I'm talking in general
---
&gt; Gatekeeper: If they don't care about anything but gens you have no chance to get good points in this category, unless you're a top tier killer.
---
Even then, i feel like a big part of this comes down to if they are SWF with good coordination, if they're using toolboxes, how well they hit skill checks, and how early they find ruins. I had games where my chase went really well but they still popped 2 gens very fast.
---
&gt; Chaser: If survivors refuse to heal you get less hit points, which results in max silver, maybe gold emblem in this category.
---
Really good point... that's silly lol
---
Probably clowns doing
---
That‚Äôs a yikes from me
---
Dunno. People who hate me for my opinions and attitude on other posts perhaps? If that is the case I don‚Äôt see how that negatively impacts me.
---
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs working out for him so far! I‚Äôm not able to watch him live since he streams when I‚Äôm at work so I can only watch his YouTube videos.
---
i always get them mixed up. about to just start calling them the spooky face bois
---
Ah ok yea you see that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always thought, he has great ideas but they come across as whiney to some people. He does have enough experience in the game to call out it‚Äôs bs
---
Did I not specify I down the farmer is I recognize they are farming and let the victim escape? Pretty sure I did buddy. This conversation is going nowhere with either of us, for both our sakes I‚Äôll let you have the last word, or don‚Äôt, your choice. We both have things to do... **dont we?**
---
OMG "Graping" hahahahahhaha
---
Makes you appreciate that the survivors don‚Äôt scream the entire time you‚Äôre carrying them
---
option one: *be a bit edgy and say that you‚Äôre italian and english isn‚Äôt your first language*
---
option two: *pretend that mine was an honest joke and that you‚Äôre the only one who understood it*
---
option three: *be angry because i look stupid without context and say ‚Äò1vs1 swf i‚Äôll beat the shit out of you‚Äô*
---
my brain can‚Äôt decide so i‚Äôll just panic and go with oh god oh fuck oh god oh fuck oh god
---
I used to stream DbD right when the nurse got nerfed. I just built a pc and it was beefy enough to stream and people loved my voice in discord and I wanted to show how op she was. (At the time no one believed me because I hadn‚Äôt play the game yet. And look at were we is now...)
---
I had about 20-40ish follows and the same viewer count.... That doesn‚Äôt happen really ever I learned. It was a really weird thing on twitch. I stopped for various reasons but the main one was the weird love/ hate relationship. Both chat/viewer wise and monetarily. I do regret just stopping because it stunted my stream pretty badly but I came back playing games I liked and it was ok. And now my community is dope as hell. Genuinely love them.
---
Worst part is as shitty as this game is sometimes, it‚Äôs normally fine. It‚Äôs really fun actually. It‚Äôs the people who ruin it.  And yeah I can be a ass but I ain‚Äôt toxic.
---
Sounds like a pleasant person
---
Not a separate client, but a different build and because consoles don't support beta programs in that way it's only available on steam. Under game properties, you can enable "PTB".
---
Where is that jerk that argued this 2 weeks ago?
---
Not here, eh? Thought so.
---
option one would be decent, English isn't my first language. edgelord.
---
That's an extremely poor argument bud. A battle pass or any kind if equivalent pass isnt full of content someone is going to be unable to play because of a mental or physical disorder 99% of the time. And I dont think anyone in their right mind expects us to do things like get rid of blood cus one guy is squeamish but still wants to play the game about murdering people. (Looking at you china).
---
that made me laugh tho ngl
---
Statistically, it's not much of a bump.
---
Why are half the comments here just saying ‚Äúlol, no one is forcing you to buy them‚Äù like that justifies the outrageous pricing? Why are people here afraid to have an actual discussion about this issue that is becoming increasingly prevalent among paid games?
---
I‚Äôd rather have the recolors than not if
---
I will always make fun of a killer that goes for the camping merit badge right outta the gate, those killers will always be mocked.
---
Anything else is fair game to me as a survivor main, even no-ed that makes others cry.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;one side isn‚Äôt gonna have fun regardless
---
That's not true at all. Dying as survivor doesn't mean the game wasn't fun.
---
As a rank 4 nurse currently, I only get teabaggers and instaheal swfs every game. My profile comments are looking mighty -rep ü§£
---
Yeah as a general rule I never buy cosmetics at all as they always have (what I see as) ridiculous prices. 
---
If they were half the price I would say they were still expensive BUT I would be much more inclined to buy something now and again, as opposed to never buying any.
---
But after saying that I have to confess, I just broke my rule and bought this costume because Fen because she just looks too pretty in it. Now I just want a ballerina costume for my ‚ù§Ô∏èPiggy‚ù§Ô∏è!
---
Sorry, I'm not good at making memes
---
It really is weird how actual new content is way cheaper than cosmetics
---
I wish we could just turn it off, I find it obnoxious when I‚Äôm trying to listen and it goes off and I can‚Äôt hear anything else.
---
Depends on how bad the team is.  Smarter players will keep doing gens but overly altruistic randoms will sit there squatted around for two minutes and accomplish nothing and it's a shame because face camping should never be rewarded with success for the killer
---
üòê
---
Eh you could easily make an argument for DBD to be moderately pay to win. Yeah they have the shrine and all but that is obviously weighted away from the good perks. Which quite a few of are locked behind licensed killers. IMO all the licensed killer perks should be readily available in their own separate shrine to be bought with shards. Bbq and chili is one of the most meta and useful perks in the game with an almost unparalleled level of information being granted ON TOP OF a BP gain that is only rivaled by a survivor perk that only has the BP gain. But that's locked behind a cash only killer and that perk has come into the shrine 3 times I believe. Meanwhile overcharge has come into the shrine 28(?) Times.
---
lmao in rus region ballerina skin costs a little more than the whole basic game on steam sale

---
The toe bending is actually a really nice touch. Foot binding was in time with the era she would have lived, disturbing as that is.
---
Again your entire second paragraph reads as an unapologetic defense of killers using farmers to get kills on defenseless targets.  You started off saying one thing and then you completely did a 180 and went the other way with it.  And my suggestion of what to do in that scenario is bulletproof logic that helps you more as a killer in every measurable metric in game while also punishing the farmer.  It is literally pointless to use them to farm the same guy when you could get more bps, better emblem progress and still keep a body on the hook.  A hooked survivor is a hooked survivor.
---
Because... it's the Wraith's newest face...?
---
For me dying as survivor sucks, and I don‚Äôt find it fun, but I accept it. So it has truth in the fact I don‚Äôt like it and a majority of other people also don‚Äôt like it.
---
They wouldn't charge that much if people weren't buying them. If they're making the returns they want, why would they change?
---
It's pretty strong if you know how to use it and it's just as or more common than before.
---
Freddy is Have 2.0 confirmed. He seems to be a lot more fun now. Looking forward to this rework.
---
They should be purchased with blood points so dedicated players will have a use for those points
---
Exactly. When I play survivor I play to pip. As long as I bang out some gens, get some unhooks, and get in a few chases, I don‚Äôt care about escaping. As long as the game tells me I did good enough to rank up I‚Äôm fine with dying.
---
I'm not saying make it bannable, I'm saying it isn't an actual game mechanic and shouldn't be treated as such. Survivors should not be able to nope out of the game just because they don't like how the game is going, and it's completely uncounterable for the killer.
---
Ah it doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs ok
---
You can play fair all day and still get accused of playing like a scumbag. If I 3 hook ever member of your team I wasn't camping or tunneling.
---
Again, it depends on the situation and type of player(s) you're dealing with.
---
"Being able to DC is not a game mechanic" what you really meant to say "Disconnecting is not suppose to be part of the game to help others or in any other way" at least I believe that's what you're saying.
---
Also also disconnecting IS a game mechanism sir.
---
What else is insidious used for lets be real
---
I wanted to prestige Ghostface so I played about 30 games in a row with just him. There were about 20 Gateaus, 7 BPS, and 7 survivor puddings.
---
I play legion a lot and haven't seen that happen to someone yet, I'll be on the lookout for that glitch now
---
Behaviour is the company who develops the game. BHVR is their logo I believe.
---
Pro tip: When you use m2 as Freddy it looks like you are lunging so you can use it at pallets to make people drop/jump over pallets while you can just walk to the other side and hit them.
---
Look at the picture is he lunging or holding m2?
---
r/subsifellfor
---
People say that but that absolutely isn't my experience.  I get next to no salt and the rare times I do it was just a toxic entitled meme of a survivor upset that they died while playing in a swf group lol.  I'm far more likely to receive a gg than salt post game.
---
I want Ballerina Pig
---
OINK
---
Atleast that‚Äôs a free game though
---
Just worse, since he can't insta teleport and they are only active part of the time when they're asleep.
---
At tier 3 it lasts forever and the healing applies to anyone and every healing action. I've entirely negated a killers pressure by running around the map healing people with it. I've picked people up in record time with it while they got slugged. It gives you plenty of time for end game saves when you have it and heal everyone with it. As someone who barely puts BP into survivors it is a wonderful perk. Sorry I'm not into using 4 crutch perks like every other survivor in this game and dont you fucking dare tell me that they dont use them because I went from rank 20 to rank 4 and it is legit the same 8 or 9 perks across the board every single fucking game.
---
Oh trust me our Ballerina outfit is only half of our Utopia. We'll fight until we acquire our missing half
---
Pretty sure that if only a small amount of people pay for it and Behaviour gets lots of complaints they'll lower the price. It just came out so I think they are blowing up the price to see how much money they can make from it.
---
Well sure the dying part isn't fun, but it doesn't mean the game overall wasn't fun. But when you play against a killer that focuses on you every time you get unhooked, that makes the whole game unfun. The fun is in trying to escape. When you get tunneled you know you're dying and it's just a case of making the chase last as long as possible to waste the killer's time so your teammates can survive. Knowing you're going to die is not fun.
---
Coward.
---
TLDR: No she didn't drown but got killed by her father.
---
Story: her dad was in huge debt and went to ask for a payraise, but got fired instead. He went berserk and slashed her mother with a Katana. When Rin got home after work, she heard her mother scream and went upstairs to find her mother cut open in all sorts of places. Then her father slashed at her too and she started to feel rage. They got in a bit of a figt, he slashed her leg and arm, then yanked her hair and threw her against a partition. The glass broke and she went through, filling her body with glass including her airways, and making her land a floor beneath. She heard footsteps coming down so she tried to crawl away through a sea of glass, but she knew she would die. However she went in such a rage mode that she just wanted to punish her father for what he had done, were it in this life or the next. This is when the entity took her, promising blood and revenge, which still has me believe that her dad will be added as a survivor at one point. 
---
There is also a story to why the entity took her and not someone who was an actual killer, but this should be enough
---
Wow that killer got destroyed
---
Stalking the killer for the flashlight blind is a terrible strategy, the survivor wastes time doing nothing when they could be doing generators, and they may not even get it. The killer can easily avoid it.
---
In my opinion the pip system should be A LOT more simple and just back to basics.
---
Survivors pips = number of escapes -2. (So if all escape, everyone gets 2 pips, if none escapes, everyones gets -2 pips).
---
Killer pips = number of killed survivors -2
---
He's so slow and boring though. He feels like a generic M1 killer most of the time. He doesn't feel fast and agile. He lost that uniqueness.
---
I hope they do. I really love soo many skins in this game but they're soo expensive, I wish they'd lower it down.
---
Haha legion bad
---
The justification of the ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù pricing is that it is their company and they get to choose what they charge. It‚Äôs up to the consumer to decide if the item is worth the value offered. The skins do not provide an advantage to the player and therefore do not affect gameplay. Why do you believe you should get the final say in what a company decides to charge?
---
Let me guess you also think camping is just a strategy?
---
Dying ruins a match for me. No matter what. Down and done. I had no fun that match. But I accept that and don‚Äôt complain to anyone. I just don‚Äôt like dying more than anything else.
---
I just realized I fucked up the image link.
---
Sorry for those that clicked and were forced to download the pic.
---
God I hate mobile.
---
That‚Äôs not enough for me to have fun. In fact simply escaping is the fun part for me. But I accept death, doesn‚Äôt mean I like it or what happened before.
---
Well you get the points back from the hooked survivors when they get unhooked. If they take away the negative points for the hooked survivors, they would also have to take away the points for the unhooked survivors. That means your points would still be the same.
---
cool
---
The bloody traps are useless since they're so visible, and losing the aura-reading is painful. And the trial going on shouldn't hamper Freddy from using his power. But the coming out of the generator animation is cool, I guess.....
---
A lot of times I'll end up finding the just unhooked survivor and I'll either give em a slap to check for borrowed time or I'll give em a no no nod so they know I'm not a cunt. Its gotten me a few 4ks I didnt deserve cus that survivor was nice and realized I would have had it if i was a cunt. Lmao JK every single time I'm nice to survivors they go full tilt try hard and teabag me at the exit. Not once have they ever been the remotest amount of nice to me.
---
who even brings chalk pouches or luck offerings above rank 15
---
Right. Ten bucks for a cosmetic that has no bearing on gameplay whatsoever is a lot to ask for. So I won't purchase it. Isn't that crazy how that works?
---
But he can teleport to generator which is stronger than Hag, Hag has to wait until her trap is activated to teleport. So the powers is very similar in scale.
---
What...?
---
Love this animation it'll actually feel like you're fighting Freddy now.
---
Also, hooked that survivor once and didnt facecamp. Probably should've at that point.
---
Free market out here breaking people‚Äôs brains.
---
I put forth my trap card, object of obsession!
---
Well I wasn't able to save my freind he had teir 3 at 99% in the basement face camping we had to leave him for dead he got 1 kill at least
---
~~Freddy~~ SCP 106 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT
---
Props for you my friend, you're a rare kind... The bad part is that actally good streamers don't get as much viewers, meanwhile those ... People whose name i won't mention ...dud..... Get lots and lots of views, further making the comunity another chernobyl
---
... They increased his movespeed.
---
Why does she look like she just came out of a concentration camp
---
You
---
You called people braindead
---
What did you expect
---
Can u believe that Freddy is even worst now??????
---
Using something that isn't an actual game mechanic is exploiting and it should be 100% bannable.
---
Wish there was a seperate lobby where everyone could just have some fun. Still play the game but not have to be sweaty all day. Sometimes I just wanna go point at the killer and have him leave or play made up games like ring around the generator or whose pallet is it anyway.
---
The clown from Terrifier. I think he‚Äôd be a great killer for the game.
---
I want a Freddy that doesn‚Äôt have a pepperoni pizza for a face.
---
I think he's definitely underrated and overly memed on, but the instadown isn't too effective against a decent survivor. He still gets looped into oblivion and jungle gyms can completely invalidate the saw. He's an M1 killer in many scenarios. On open maps and/or in open areas he is a super overlooked menace, though.
---
If a survivor is within proximity to the hook with you, you do not lose points.
---
I'm a pimp you're a nerd. I'm slick you're cheesy.
---
Bro, fuck haddonfield
---
No u
---
Fuck that offering, while less strode key offering are, im good
---
... What's the meme? How do you use it?
---
I hope gets reworked
---
If you think DS is toxic then tbh git gud or don‚Äôt tunnel
---
I don't understand why I'm getting silver devout I hooked everyone at least twice two got out but they had been hooked
---
Not even out for testing yet, people already calling it OP.
---
Ok entitled:)
---
You know they can't see your name in the lobby right? This is just kind of an asshole move
---
Have to ignore my own suggestion real quick to tell you again, to make you understand, because you don‚Äôt get it apparently.
---
If I know someone is farming the person I instantly re hook, I let them unhook the victim, then I go after the farmer, letting the victim intentionally get away because they don‚Äôt deserve to be farmed
---
TL:DR
---
**If I find out someone is farming my victim I let my victim go and attack the farmer**
---
It is my fault however for not specifying I stop doing my ‚Äúinstant re-hook‚Äù strategy if there is a farmer.
---
BrainLESS not brain dead. Sorry for miscommunication.
---
Fuck haddofield x34
---
Everytime I'm kind and fuck around with survivors they immediately go full immersion try hard gen rush. Or they expect me to be actually legit 100% farming. For survivors there is nothing but sweaty try hard and farm games. You can't be a fun killer who screws around unless you're against survivors who cant even begin to match your level.
---
The whole situation can be circumvented by not respecting pallets and breaking them as soon as their down. Doing that will end the loop instantly. I cant tell you how many times ive extended a chase at a safe pallet by a minute or two because the killer respected my pallet, and then refused to break it for some reason. In situations where youre stuck at a safe pallet, that is down, for a long time as killer, its honestly youre own fualt. Either break the chase or break the pallet. No good survivor is going to leave a safe pallet unless you force them too.
---
Yep smh a killer can actually have gen pressure and mess with loops so he can hit me and actually be a fun viable killer
---
Not when you are stuck in the ‚Äúpick up a survivor‚Äù animation as I specified
---
Thanks for the clarification. I only have DBD on Steam so it's all right.
---
A warning is given and unless fred is chaseing a survivor when they fall asleep he will be unable to take advantage of the dream world as he will not be able to see auras and they will most likely wake up very fast. Before the change against good freddys wakeing up while injured was a risk as it allowed him to transition mindgame you leading to a down, now its a no brainer choice.
---
I didn't hear, how long does it take for a survivor to fall asleep? And does Freddy have to be in range for the survivors to fall asleep?
---
tbh, i feel that all the wprk they put into it and how cool it is, it might need tk be that cost to make a profit
---
I mean thanks for clarifying but that‚Äôs not really any better honestly. No offense.
---
His face looks like that cause they took the guy from the 2012 (?) remake who wasn‚Äôt the original actor
---
I‚Äôm dead lmao
---
Yes. You are right in that they are optional and you can simply not purchase them. But for us who want to purchase them, I don't see a problem with asking for the cosmetics to be a bit cheaper
---
ptb is on the 9th confirmed
---
I believe it's also in microsleep but we just have to wait and see
---
Glad i've set up chrome to ask before downloading.
---
" She needs to be balanced for top level play" if they balanced around top tier play we wouldnt have a game where 4 killers are viable past rank 5 (viable in the sense you dont have to fking break your balls sweating like hell to even get close to a pip)
---
While I agree it shouldn't be more than a dlc it's optional.
---
Summary bullet points: 
---
** Survivors passively fall asleep. From the start of the match, you have 60s till you fall asleep. 
---
** Freddy is now visible when you are awake and can attack survivors normally. When you are asleep, you will hear his lullaby and it is *not* directional (like Huntress). 
---
** Three ways to wake up: (1) Fail skill check. (2) Have another survivor perform the Wake Up action. This action will take more time the more it is used. (3) Find the alarm clock. It is supposed to spawn far away and there is only one alarm clock. Grab it and break it and you will be free from falling asleep for 30s. 
---
Note: Adrenaline will still wake you. 
---
** Dream Snares - Freddy can place up to 8 snares that slow survivor movement speed by 15% and prevent them from fast vaulting. They operate like Hags traps - when you place a new one, the oldest one will disappear. There is an add-on which can allow you to turn your snares into fake pallets that burst into a shower of blood when slammed. Freddy is not stunned. 
---
** Dream Projection - unlimited range. Freddy can teleport to a gen. The gen will start spewing blood and a pool of blood will open beneath it that Freddy will come out of. 
---
Nothing has changed to his base movement speed and terror radius: Still 24m and 4/6 m/s.

They turned freddy into a clown that needs to wait a minuite to use his power. The gen teleport is the only good thing about the overhaul.
---
Yeah I hate when they gain distance and get juuuust far enough away from the chase zone to lose me my bloodthirst.
---
My swf group and I* ;)
---
Me already making bomb ass memes after the dev stream: ü§†
---
I used to love old Legion but I pretty much always played with Frank's Mixtape and Cold Dirt only, with those two add ons they felt so fun and agile. Without the add ons they were definitely too weak to keep up with good survivors so while it sucks they turned them into a boring M1 killer I think it was probably for the best until they take another look at them to either buff or rework.
---
Those literally mean the same thing, though....
---
DC-ing is not meant to be used in a match as a feature. So no, it is not a game mechanic. You're just arguing semantics now, at any rate.
---
Still I feel everyone in the chat was yelling OP OP or SO WEAK and no one has even played him. I feel using the word brainless was justified. And if anyone was snowflake enough to be offended when talking about a video game then I am disappointed in this community.
---
I feel bad for him he got boolied by the chat
---
Thank you for the great information! I never even thought about using the Blood Web on other killers!
---
Yeah you can just swing at a pallet when the survivor is about to throw it down and bam
---
They're useless... LOL those traps will make running the shack instant death if you're asleep, no long placing animation, no slowdown... They can't fast vault! Freddy is gonna be top tier.
---
No. Railroad spikes from his new cosmetics.
---
Jane ain't fat, she **T H I C C**.
---
What does the pic say?
---
LOL. 4-man escapes? Seriously? You're bitching about all 4 not escaping? It's like killers are better in red ranks. Typical survivor BS. RUN KINDRED ASSHOLE. How about you run team-oriented perks? Just a thought.
---
They said they're reworking a map after badham, I hope it's Haddonfield
---
Rin was healthy, it was her mother who was ill
---
Yes I shall bring 5 perks
---
Freddy is a Hag/Doctor/Nurse combo now. He's far too complicated.
---
Yikes. Who pissed in your cornflakes? There are situations where its viable, but most of the time its not ideal.
---
And any survivor who sees that trap will run right on to the next loop. It's like Trapper and Hag's traps being far too visible.
---

Can you explain to me what the play is when there are 2 or 3 gens being worked on at once and you cannot find anyone at these gens. You've gone back and forth multiple times but they are either full 4 man swf on coms or they just get terrified the second a heartbeat shows up. You are losing these gens and there is absolutely nothing to be done about it because if you stay and try to find them they'll just immerse and you'll lose the other gens. Just because gen rushing isnt as bad as it used to be doesnt mean it still isnt a thing.
---
The 2nd diddling is upon the rank 20s
---
It's lightweight but you're right, dead hard is more of a "fuck i won't make it to the pallet" thing, i only use it to avoid damage when leaving the basement or there's nothing to throw/vault
---
Don't forget if you use fake pallet addon, you can either have the god pallet broken and replaced with a fake, or if it's not broken, place a decoy god pallet on the other side making it a 50/50 gamble which one is the actual god-pallet.
---
I dunno man lots of people already buy skins, and I'd rather spend money on the specific ones I want than a variety pack.
---
I know that this is going to get me downvoted, but I am trying to be the voice of reason here.  
---
Neskymos is right.  
---
Of course ... getting camped or tunneled isn't fun.  
---
But it's also not fun to get looped for ages. Or lose your hex within the first 20 seconds of the game.  
---
SWFs that run arround with insta-heals and sit in voice coms just to destroy you isn't fun either.  
---
And all of that is happening.  
---
But people treat this as "normal". Even though only the survivors are having fun.  
---
But as soon as the killer 'tunnels' or 'camps' a person (even if it's the right call to make, because the exit gates are open or the survivors play super altruistic)   
---
people will treat him badly, insult him and might even report him for 'toxic behavior'.  
---
"WAAAH! I ran into the killer after I got unhooked! He's not supposed to hit me! TUNNELER! -REP!"
---
People in this reddit treat camping/tunneling or even funnier: The use of Noed - as something scummy and toxic for killers.
---
Even though there are perks which even support a 'fishing with bait' camping playstyle.
---
P.S:   
---
&gt;It's not fair at all on players who just want to play for fun and not take the game seriously. 
---
That's a stupid point to make. Basically survivor say this to tell the killer: "Play the game how WE want you to play it, or else we aren't having fun."  
---
But what about the killers enjoyment?  
---
He's playing the game to kill survivors by ANY MEAN NECESSARY. 
---
Not to play by the rules made up by his OPPONENTS.
---
im gonna assume he believes anything below red ranks are newbies.
---
Why would i?
---
Rippin, what‚Äôs the rule on Shields?
---
New Wraith is just X√ªr
---
I always confuse it cause the feather picture lol my wife laughs at me when I say it
---
You basically know where the killer is almost all the time anyway, and the killer knows where you are (or at least what area)
---
Nothing nerfing him to the ground between one week again can't fix!
---
Lmao it was so awkward tho
---
Feels like your fighting SCP-106
---
The God pallet always spawns in the same door, but it would be cool of it was random.
---
Just use bond dude
---
2 out of 4 should die in a even game.
---
lmao 4 man escapes, might as well play a DBD with no killer in the game. Try ‚ÄúGen Fixing Simulator 2000‚Äù
---
Might as well just be memeing
---
It‚Äôs funny the killer that can see you when he hooks someone is the person who facecamps
---
u monster ... teaching the new players already how to loop killers? dO yOu WaNt ThE wOrLd To BuRn ThIs BaDlY? :D
---
Ik, but it still looks like shit.
---
It says: "$10 for a cosmetic set is ridiculous as it costs way more than a DLC"
---
I'll repost it.
---
Hags traps are too visible? You can't just keep running from loop to loop if he keeps putting down traps. You don't have to take the time to place the trap ahead of time, you can just stick one down when a survivor runs to it.
---
Lol what
---
But we already have a clown.
---
So. They‚Äôre completely different characters.
---
Kate and leather face maybe not the clown. They aren‚Äôt even a pair
---
The devs should make it to where the hookd survivor dies slower if the killer is within a certain range of the hook.
---
You mean hooked or sacrificed?
---
In order to get silver devout you have to sacrifice 2 or 3 survivors. To get gold, you must get a 4K.
---
Yea, not happening. First off that movie is for whatever reason blowing up, but it‚Äôs hardly big enough that DBD would want to pay for him. We already have a clown, who has a good backstory and ability. Dude from the movie is just a normal serial killer with no powers or trademarks.
---
He is creepy as hell though, but a reskin probably is the best chance
---
If you were any good at the game it wouldn‚Äôt have got to that point. You can look at walls, fake the pick up animation, search the nearby area and try looking up straight away if you do get blinded, so
---
Bind your action key to a side mouse button, it actually improved my skillcheck accuracy
---
Tru3ta1ent bad, upvotes to the left
---
I'm planing on quitting the game if I don't like the new Freddy, I like him for what he is, I don't what some BS OP killer.
---
Trapper,leatherface, pig,legion, and some others need buffs
---
If you pay attention to the movie, he shoots himself in the head at the end and survives plus takes a lot of punishment throughout the movie unlike a human could take. On his wiki it says he‚Äôs a demon plus how does he teleport from location to location? He‚Äôs definitely not human.
---
"Yikes you don't even like campers or people with a do whatever you want even when u know youre being an asshole-mentality, who pissed in your cornflakes". Sorry buddy but replying like that **was fun for me** and that's the only thing that matters right?
---
That's kinda the point. Do you know Freddys backstory from before dbd?
---
Bloody bundle of sticks?
---
on the other hand its good that Gameplay Elements cost less than cosmetics
---
Thank you , yeah as i was mainly focusing on gameplay I didnt really want to edit them into like a comedy style , Like noob3 etc , Any ideas on how I can elaborate on the raw gameplay?
---
I dont get it.
---
Yeah, multiple years sure is fast
---
Exactly, put OoO on the one fking tryhard in your group who perma spams everyone else constantly to play while he lives and breathes dbd and just enjoy a nice chill game of his keyboard going haywire and constantly screaming where the killer is while pissing himself laughing that him being rank 1 gets to run a rank 10\~ killer around 4ever since us others are around rank 10-15 survivors since we dont play often
---
Why? It's not like they can possibly make him worse
---
When you loop a killer long enough the salt gets real haha
---
Not going to happen. Terrifier isn‚Äôt really a cult classic like the other classics we have received. We also already have a clown, and Terrifier as a movie itself really isn‚Äôt that good in quality, the only upside really is Art‚Äôs actor.
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really a large amount of people that want this either, i commend you for suggesting something, though.
---
yeah i use it that way sometimes..only for my vaulting animation to make me look at the ground so the survivor can crouch at the window and vault again. i have switched to hillbilly and iam saving up for fastguy no. 3(spirit) the legion was disapointing and i don't think i will be playing him again until the rank reset.
---
You're blaming your inability to track and find survivors as some magic performed by survivors.
---
What else do you want them to be doing? Hiding in corners? 
---
Your goal is to find them and their goal is to hide and do gens. They're doing their job but just better at evading you than you are at finding them.
---
Dw from what I can see you can still loop him normally and there is a healthy indicator and delay to his generator teleport.
---
I'll be crossing my fingers for you.
---
It does it to me sometimes but not all the time so maybe try turning the game off and on again? Hope it fixes itself.
---
Ok all things aside do you think it would be cool if he was in the game? Development and bullshit aside, just like the idea of him being in the game.
---
Well we can have $5 dlcs and expensive outfits or cheap outfits and $15 dlcs. $10 for a premium skin is pretty much industry standard. 
---
The game has been at saturation  for a while, if you play it every day, and have hundreds or thousands of hours, outfits are a good way to support the team.
---
If you would rather not, at least the gameplay dlc is cheap.
---
u high?
---
In a free game $10 is fair.
---
This shit aint free BHVR.
---
$5 is where it should be.
---
OP doesn‚Äôt know. He wants us to come up with ideas for him and take credit for making the template.
---
And made every single other aspect of them slower and worse.
---
so its Myers in a Clown costume?
---
I never said that licensed cosmetics are worth more than a new character?
---
I mean yeah? I see you went digging through my profile and if that's what you have fun doing, go nuts. Thats literally my entire point. Dude this is a video game, every person can play it however they see fit, as long as theyre having fun (And not cheating). Youre acting like I kicked your dog, when in reality I told you to play however you want as long as youre happy.
---
In my eyes, DC'ing for this shouldn't be a thing. You screw yourself out of BP, the killer gets less, and the survivor doesn't gain much either. Besides this, in the strict sense, it isn't part of the game as well.
---
However, suiciding on hook IS justified in my eyes, and I have no problem with that.
---
This is so adorable
---
Hey man assuming your username is ehat I think it is hello fellow 93 Kyle.
---
They never come out until the animation has begun dude. If I leave the body I can‚Äôt find it again because I‚Äôm too busy clearing the area by checking, and if I do come back to it they just come back and flash me. I can‚Äôt do anything against it man. I fucking tried. I can‚Äôt look straight up in the pick up animation btw so there‚Äôs hat.
---
Look, they knot come out the moment I pick up the survivor, they know when I don‚Äôt pick them up, they know when I check for them and thus lose the downed survivor location because I‚Äôm so focused on funded the flasher I take too long even though the flasher is just dancing around my vision as the downed player escapes. Nothing works, trust me.
---
Lol that funny. I wanna see more memes with Claudette
---
Actually providing you have to be 100% in dream for 50% of his power to work, he actually looks kinda weak üôÑ
---
Yes they are, they came in the DLC bundle...
---
Oh wait...
---
Dude da faq is wrong with you?!
---
I‚Äôm still sorta new, I only play doc, trap, hag, Dwight, Meg so far
---
My only gripe with DS is at the end of the game with the gates open. Aside from that, it's perfectly fine.
---
We have enough knife killers right now, I‚Äôd rather see a new weapon, something like Doctor‚Äôs massive sticc.
---
Because playing survivor isnt as appealing as playing killer. Then throw in the fact that you need 4 times more players wanting to play survivor than killer. All that equals long wait times.
---
technically they told the truth, 80% of the store is available via iridescent shards.
---
it just so happens that 80% is made up of all the sucky cosmetics
---
The level of accurate detail, as well as if he was going for survivor version he wuldnt have left the toes the same, shows me he got the model file somewhere and tinkered with it.
---
Im trying to find how he got access to the direct model file becuase im trying to too
---
UwU &lt;3
---
Good idea I guess but I personally don‚Äôt really care about the weapons that much. I care about the characters.
---
always the feng with that cosmetic I basically expect hate mail if I kill one of those
---
They can arrest me whenever they want I won‚Äôt stop.
---
Thank you lol
---
recording with the roadmap this year it is will come with the next chapter which is hopefully 1 or 2 months away? i guess it is this year none the less
---
No worries I can do that with my survivor games!
---
That's nice. Did you think I was implying people DON'T want to purchase it? I want my car payments to be lower. Id like to have all top of the line name brand clothes to wear all at an affordable price. But the world doesn't work like that. It's insane to me how people lose their shit in this community over things that haven't even been announced yet, or entirely optional cosmetic items. I don't take things off the counter when shopping and tell the cashier it should be cheaper. If i think it's too much, I don't buy it. It doesn't mean I didn't want to purchase it. Holy, why is this so hard to comprehend?
---
And another thing, when survivors DC left and right it shouldn't be lesser than sacrifices for Devout. I've had 4 survivors DC in like 3 games the second they went on the hook/went down. Got robbed of a 4k because of 2 DC's.
---
I think there should still be add-ons that reduce the chances of skill checks in the sleep state so I hope they keep those. 
---
Also I think the skill check wake up should still keep the timer half way and not wake you up completely requiring the sleep timer to start over. It'll be interesting to see on PTB what small changes are made.
---
If you don‚Äôt wake up Freddy has a faster cooldown on his teleport
---
Cause she got that sprintburst, and sprintburst users usually just book it insteady of trying to hide
---
thanks :)
---
Trapper is making an angry face but you can't see it behind his mask
---
Very Cute üò©
---
That is literally the only point in waking up
---
Winning in this game isn't exactly defined. Escaping could be a win. Escaping with all 4 could be a win. Then again, you could escape with 4 and not pip, so as far as the ranking system is concerned, it's a loss.
---
The game isn't designed for all 4 players to escape *every time*. You gotta do whatever you can in your power for *you* to escape, my man.
---
What we're the changes I couldn't catch the stream.
---
Being able to teleport to gens is fun but I feel like the survivors have too much control over Freddy his power.
---
It looks to me that this will be weak in high ranks and op in low ranks.
---
They did say Freddy can hit you while awake so there is that as well.
---
I mean if you call being clown after waiting 60 seconds with a side of map control then yeah i guess hes god.
---
Let‚Äôs hope they stick to the plan, thanks for the info. Happy 4th!
---
Yeah pretty pissed this Freddy will still be a joke
---
Dream snares, fake pallets, and reduce speed add ons say otherwise
---
it's not trash but i admit, the sleep does seem kind of not good? it seems to be as useful as deep wound but i suppose we can see when the PTB goes live. 
---
maybe when everyone is asleep and doesn't wake up, the teleporting to gens cooldown thing will be suuuuper short so unless survivors want freddy to always be on their arse, they will probably want to wake up
---
Very cool! I like that you left the face out.
---
This happens to me in the corn and you'll always catch me spinning around frantically lol
---
Thanks
---
Gender swaps? That‚Äôs sounds very fanboy/girlish... lore would conflict with it as well.
---
Add on based killers are still bad killers at base
---
COLDWIND!!!!
---
Because neither of you are red ranks or good lol.
---
With old fred you could use the invisibility frames to get hits were you couldn't otherwise, it was a double edged sword for those who mastered him. now hes an m1 killer. GG devs.
---
What is wrong with a company selling the things that it makes for money? It isn't like the skins help much, honestly most of them hurt survivors (makes them much more visible) while killers just get to feel cool, but only see them in the lobby and if they have a mori.
---
People have already explain what tunneling and respecting the 4% are here so I'll add the bit about hitting on hook. Hitting someone who is on the hook is considered a BM. I think I've heard it be called spanking before. Try not to do that.
---
OH GOT HIS NECK
---
Rootface sounds cool for a band name.
---
Theres truth in that. If the rework isnt that good I hope they buff him in the ptb
---
There is one that is for you, but Freddy's is always going to be one and the farthest away from you. Where Jigsaw box is always predetermined once the trap is placed on you.
---
Also only body block the hook if the killer is nurse or billy cause it's boring and annoying to deal with
---
is that legit just Feng Min photoshopped or am I racist?
---
I think the pip system is fine, And very well thought out. Giving free pips to players that have died is an excellent way to lower the bar, Especially when they didn‚Äôt contribute post death and have earned their pips before dying. I don‚Äôt mind adding additional point bonuses for keeping the killer close while being camped on but escaping is more about the ability of the individual and when you die - That‚Äôs it
---
Oh? Lol didn't realize
---
Actually YES! During a livestream they said that leatherface was a big inspiration for the game. They also said that since they couldnt get him they created Billy which is pretty much a leatherface (same type of weapon and similar power)
---
You have a clip or video?
---
Probably the same reasons survivors manage to disconnect every time I lunge through a pallet and hit them
---
but very smart one too
---
hopefully, and then lerys
---
Freddy is now...
---
* Visible at 16m and can attack anyone regardless of sleep status
---
* able to teleport out of unactivated generators (with a sick blood clone animation)
---
* able to create blood snares for sleeping survivors that slow them as victims scream
---
* phases in and out of sight from 16-32 meters
---
* Has heartbeat for awake survivors, and non-directional lullaby for sleeping survivors
---
* Can use an addon to create fake pallets instead of snares (both operate and refresh like Hag's power)
---
In addition:
---
* Sleep now comes every 60 seconds passively, and indefinitely
---
* You cannot wake up from failed skill checks
---
* you must use a specific clock in the dream world to wake up (like Pig's trapboxes)
---
* Awake teammates can wake up sleeping ones, but this takes more time if you do it repeatedly
---
* you must heal teammates before you can wake them up
---
**There will be a PTB next week for practice and tweaks**
---
Its crazy how poorly balanced this game is. When survivors aren‚Äôt tryharding and you get a neutral/killer sided map, the game is painfully easy as killer.
---
But slightly adjust one thing and it becomes very difficult to keep up. 
---
Maybe we‚Äôd all be better off not taking the game so seriously.
---
I think it was more failed skill checks only slow it down not fully reset it because it would be really dumb otherwise. 
---
Plus, I'm sure they can adjust the time it takes to fall asleep if its too long and stuff like that.
---
You dont have to havr it to enjoy the game
---
I legitimately thought it was the actual THX sound the first time I heard it.
---
ALL TEABAGGING IS TOXIC BEHAVIOR.  TO SAY IT IS A JUSTIFIABLE ACTION IS TO ALSO SAY FACE CAMPING IS JUSTIFIABLE.  BUT NEITHER ARE, AND DOING EITHER MAKES YOU A TOXIC PLAYER.  THE GAME MECHANICS AND MAPS WERE DESIGNED TO ALLOW ALL PARTIES A CHANCE TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE INDIVIDUAL MATCH, TEABAGGING IS SIMPLY EXPLOITING A GAME MECHANIC SO AS TO BE A PRICK
---
I‚ÄôM NOT CALLING YOU A PRICK.... UNLESS YOU TEABAG.
---
Oh trust me I can tell. But karma dont matter to me. It's the equivalent of ego points.
---
If that's true, when I get the trap I just spin the camera around to look for the two farthest boxes and that's it. =\_=
---
Sadly they removed a lot of theirbold streams on twitch. Not sure about youtube tho. I will try to find the one
---
The devs stated on the official forums that they forgot to say on the stream that hitting a survivor with your weapon will instantly put them to sleep.
---
A "filthy casual" is someone who uses Bond... I see way more people who run Bond and get downed within 10 seconds of a chase than people who run Self Care. Like, disproportionately more.
---
No that's a bad move on the rescuer's part, you're fine. I usually just chase the rescuer and then make sure they die because it's pretty scummy. I even camp them most of the time.
---
Well that makes me happier :).
---
based on what? Or does self-care now heal you while you're running?
---
They were silently screaming because you could have used the 80 seconds the killer was occupied to finish a gen.
---
Corn- and Bambooblindness is a serious and widespread disability ok.
---
The devs streams on yotube are alive, i will try to remember the one. It was a pretty old Dev stream around 60-120~
---
Eh... that‚Äôs understandable I guess.
---
* You level up your character through gaining XP by playing games.
---
* You nolonger level up through bloodpoints, they are instead spent on the bloodmarket, which is shared across all survivors, and all killers.
---
* Perks are acquired through character level ups, not through the bloodmarket.
---
They don‚Äôt seem to realize that sadly. Best part? I‚Äôm getting 4K whenever I do this.
---
I hope so but I don't remember them saying that, they just said skill checks wake you up. Plus I'm pretty sure if you watch the footage it shows a survivor asleep just fully reset by a skillcheck. Again it's possible to change but it baffles me how these devs think sometimes :/
---
he still seems like an m1 killer but able to get really good map pressure
---
I mean... What's the point of NOT waking up?
---
Couldn't think of a better title? Couldn't muster up the effort? Too much for you? Then I can only muster up the effort for a downvote.
---
We want pretty woman leatherface!
---
I LOVE THIS MEME
---
Any time I get stuck last alive and hatch is closed, both doors are on the same wall/in the same corner/on the same side of the I map.
---
To be fair he didn‚Äôt use iri head. Also NOED doesn‚Äôt work with hatchets so maybe he just wasn‚Äôt that good
---
There is no saving a survivor against a leatherface holding a chainsaw up. 
---
Borrowed Time doesnt work against the more common camping killers (Myers, Wraith, Ghostface, Pig) who use the low terror radius to proxy camp the hook and tunnel the unhooked guy
---
Its funny how the DS rework actually made me start using the perk. It is definitely a good camping/tunneling counter, probably the only one worth running.
---
I the concept was cool. But the actual effects are meh. If they want him to be viable, the timer has to drop to 30 seconds and skill checks no longer wake up. Also, even if all 4 are asleep, that's 18 seconds between a teleport. Nurse and Billy can travel ANYWHERE with less cool down than the teleport. Plus their mobility doesn't get weaker or outright useless as the game goes on. 
---
Snares are okay, but it is so easy to wake up that they won't do much.
---
Pallets are fun but not that good.
---
Phasing isn't a mindgame like they hinted at.
---
All in all, I'm disappointed. It can work, but he needs some adjustments big time.
---
When you promised you were good at the game but instead you run Urban
---
\*Attacks a section of the playerbase in a developer stream\*
---
'wtf why am I banned??'
---
üëÄ
---
Its going to depend heavily on what killer and map you‚Äôre on but in general it should be very slim that you are able to open the last door by yourself.
---
I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT TEABAGGING IS JUSTIFIED, I WAS JUST SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE REASON WHY SOMEBODY MIGHT DO IT. BUT YEAH ITS ABSOLUTELY TOXIC. NOTHING SUCKS MORE THAN THAT FIRST GAME WHEN YOU'RE NEW TO KILLER AND YOU GET BULLIED BY A TEABAGGING SWF GROUP. IT STILL BUGS THE HELL OUT OF ME WHEN I HAVE A DECENT GAME AND STILL GET TEABAGGED AT THE GATE, LIKE WHERE'S THE SPORTSMANSHIP?
---
Okay.
---
60 seconds but timer reduces with amount of survivors who are asleep. Cannot remember the timer reduction.
---
I have faith i dont think the devs would make it that bad.
---
Based on all the red rank games I play. And I fail to see how your second question is connected to anything since Bond doesn't exactly let you heal while running either. What a weak comeback.
---
I hate Trappers and Clowns, just can't stand going against them. And 3+ blinks Nurse/Omega blink, but that is obvious.
---
Well said.
---
... Have you played killer recently? Killing only 2 will most certainly get you a depip. Specially if you just camped one of them from the start. This ain't 2017 chief and even back then 2 kills without any extra hook was only a safety pip.
---
There are these things called emblems now which require you to defend gens as longs as possible, win chases as fast as possible and hook as many times as you can without camping the hook.
---
Confirmed to be Tuesday, July 9th
---
There's a lot of stuff this game doesn't tell you. Like I still don't know what hex totems do I know what they do when they are broke but I don't what the main thing is that they do
---
So wait. If I level Dwight to 40 do all survivors have his perks instantly?
---
This bug I love it &gt;3
---
Honestly. The shard prices are ridiculous. Tens of thousands of shards for a legendary outfit. You'd have to level up like a hundred levels to unlock ONE outfit. I'd rather invest 10‚Ç¨ per skin than putting this amount of time into the game. I mean I'd invest that time anyway, because DBD is love, but I'm full time busy. Even if you aren't full time busy, it'd take you ages to unlock ONE event/legendary outfit.
---
accepting reddit gold and platinum too. no silver though please, too cheap
---
That's an easy win, if he's too busy going back and forth you can easily do gens and get u hooks, or just ignore it. You make it seem like it's bad that the trapping killer can effectively trap things.
---
Lol, not even gonna touch this, have a nice day
---
peanits said that when u hit someone with freddy, they will instantly get asleep on the forums, they forgot to mention that in the stream, so i dont see any problems, its easier to sleep someone and its easier to wake up
---
Woah, this actually seems really strong.
---
I would go for Meg to get adrenaline (and sprint burst if that's something you'd enjoy). And then when you have enough shards buy David to get We're gonna live forever and get those sweet bloodpoints.
---
Are all text posts on this subreddit now going to be in this format then?
---
That's why I haven't been playing much recently, bored asf of Ghost face 8x in a row
---
the old one was just wallhack, he couldnt do shit, just sleep survivors wich all they can wake up very easy with self care, i actually love this new freddy.
---
K remember to say gg to every facecamper with ebony mori's or else you're a hypocrite. I wonder how many times in a row a guy like you needs to get camped before he changes his mind, then again who even plays survivor am I right?
---
Aaaaaa with Wraith to see his eybrowes i am a idiot. Thank you.
---
Whilst I respect your opinion I have to wholeheartedly disagree, You lose if you get a Entity displeased or even a brutal killer. And if you're playing anywhere above brown ranks, camping will seriously hurt you and noed is just gonna make you lose out on hit points, in green ranks you can get 4k and still get a blank pip if your too effective so if that's the way you play killer I'm gonna assume your a really really low rank in which case killer is easy as balls, but try actually going against Survivors who haven't just bought the game:/
---
I'll be honest as a freddy main I love the new changes but I will always miss the old one.
---
Calm thine tits bruh, I was jokingly categorising that everyone heals in the corner of the map, even if the didn't do that it takes too much time. 
---
You keep on saying "in my games" or "in red ranks" but you do realise no one actually gives a fuck, red rank isn't the top 1% of the world dude, anyone can get to red ranks. At any rate, the logic behind self-care being more used than bond is because most players don't trust in their teammates enough/solo-queue and want to be mostly independent, which is perfectly fine but not optimal. They're just not risking liability of their teammates being complete degenerates in trade of slower progress, which makes perfect sense. Trading away optimising for ensurance. In other words: if more people use self-care it doesn't mean it's better.
---
That sad point when the McDonald's WiFi is still better the most of the free Wi-Fi around me
---
This argument doesn‚Äôt work because they were offering $5-8 dlc chapters/paragraphs for two years before they implemented the cosmetic store.
---
Easy win. Just do gens with ruin and when someone gets chased disable his trap to let him get off the person
---
It's all good! Trying to spread some good ol DBD humor and lighten up the sub :)
---
but, literally the current one gets hin dered by his power in rank 1
---
he probably was stream sniped though tbh. His hyper competitive attitude almost asks for douchebags to stream snipe him.
---
True but anyone not using iron will is still getting an advantage from healing because they won't scream anymore ^^
---
I don't think so.
---
As far as I know, perks aren't shared. But you should still get teachables at levels 30, 35, and 40.
---
When you get dwight to level 40, you have a chance to obtain one of his perks on another survivor when they level up.
---
&gt;His ego can get the better of him
---
that's a great deal of it, but there was a period of time where it felt like he just constantly complained about everything, every stream, all the time. He's gotten much better on that front though, but suffice to say it turned a lot of people away from him.
---
Honestly I like that
---
No it's good for slowing the game down and giving killers with nurses a better chance to find you. Self-care is the strongest killer perk in the right hands.
---
Well that helps, but it is not gonna fully save him. It certainly makes him not terrible, but they usually will be awake unless you're chasing them. We'll see how it works out on the PTB, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
hell yeah
---
This Is so true üòÇ
---
What did they do?
---
I mean killer is really easy if you play mid teir plus and aren‚Äôt vs a 4 man that‚Äôs trying to win. Especially if you just run anti looping perks.
---
Oh. So when they level up they get a random perk? I‚Äôve been trying to play but can‚Äôt get a working lobby (also at work so can only play at break times). 
---
If it‚Äôs random...damn.
---
He may be bad but I find his playstyle really fun. In a worse case scenario he‚Äôll end up not fun and still weak.
---
I got this game for the anniversary and on my first game with Hag I got a message from someone saying that he reported me for camping, but all I did was put traps on hooks.
---
Isn't he mostly a 50/50 player these days?
---
Yeah but when you have survivors also looking for it and cant communicate. Felt very dumb. I like the hex totem. Gives more fin to the match. But idk. First time it's happened to me. Not to mention havent played much this season so was matched with very new survivors. So far from an easy win lol
---
He's not OP lol
---
I don't use items at all as a survivor, you don't need them.
---
As for killer add-ons, I really like the iridescent button for Legion.
---
That's like giving them a win. If they are playing scummy I want to make sure they regret it
---
They're a part of the game.
---
If you don't consider them for balance, you aren't balancing the game.
---
I remember one time the devs released some stats on the highest survival rate builds and the top build was lightweight, sprint burst, premonition, and bond
---
so I can only imagine the people using this build just SB'd away the second prem went off
---
Especially because they said waking up teammates gets longer the more often you do it. It's pretty much inefficient past 2 times. There either needs to be a drastically reduced chance for skill checks or your idea, otherwise they could be too efficient and reliable.
---
Not everyone will pass over self heal for iron will. I would however I‚Äôm not lvling Jake for it.
---
Either way self heal kills two birds with one stone in contrast to iron will if we‚Äôre talking about the same situation. You forget t3 is not forever and NOED can be cleansed.
---
Bruh
---
Important questions though
---
Exactly but so many don't. They absolutely must self care when it can harm the team.
---
Spirit:
---
*Are you waaahenging me?*
---
I've noticed that aswell I go off chasing it
---
People who self care with noed active..
---
He‚Äôs still better than he was
---
Maybe, just maybe, they had to poop.
---
Oh definitely I‚Äôm very interested in what‚Äôs gonna happen
---
Seems like you are confusing viable with top tier ....
---
Not touching it because everyone on reddit takes criticism as a personal attack and starts shooting off paragraphs. I'm saying that the 115% is a massive buff. Ending your power right behind someone is boring. They slowed him down so that they could buff the duration which makes he much better for make traversal. Stop looking at these changes at the surface level, if you look closely these were good changes.
---
I'm done talking unless you decide to bring up an actual point we can discuss other than ThEy MaDe HiM sLoWeR
---
I'm assuming by now you've heard that Fredster can make people fall asleep by hitting them? 
---
It may not sway your opinion much, but it's kinda cool.
---
Because if you saw who the killer was you would know what perks to use to counter them. If you know you were gonna again one of the stealth killers you would bring detection perks, if you knew you were going against doctor you would bring calm spirit, if you knew you were going against trapper or hag you would bring small game, see my point? A killer seeing what item you bring dosent change the course of the damm game. You knowing what killer you are going up against before the match even start does
---
Nothing at the moment. But a lot of people are suggesting that they get some buffs, QoL changes or flat out reworks along with Freddy. These killers are in a somewhat bad spot and I just want people to remember that these killers are struggling too.
---
Killers shouldn't be add-on dependant, watch at all those baby survivors that make a rant post about a spirit using prayer beads or a huntress with iridescent hatchets.
---
Goes bothways. Why do Survivors DC? 
---
Both are equally shitty.
---
Ah the classic "Everything survivors do is valiant teamwork and everything the killer does is toxic"
---
Ah but tier 3 can be forever and NOED has to be hunted. Spent the time hunting noed. Tier 3 with add ons can be permanent and that's what prompted this rant. I've seen it time and time again. Infinite tier 3 Myers and players hiding in corners self caring rather than saving from hook when Myers is on someone else or has downed someone else and carrying them to a hook or something.
---
Also funny how you only talked about the nerfs.
---
Ahahahaha!!! Gg!!
---
We'll have to see how good players manage his new power. And I think it's very nice that you can instantly put survivors to sleep by hitting them.
---
with the current freddy, ur asleep 1/4 times in a trial
---
i actually got 5 upvotes lmao thanks bro!
---
If you are getting DS'd 2-3 times a game then that's your fault.
---
They will only make a strong, easy to play killer by mistake
---
Gotta remember, spirit, hag, GF, and huntress and extremely strong, but require a lot of skill
---
5 percent movespeed is nothing? Trolling or noob, either way this conversation is over.
---
****Dead By Daylight Lunar Celebration Pack****
---
*Pay $24.99 to be able to access Red Envelopes and Firecrackers in your bloodweb during the event*
---
yep, ur right, altought people got mad because it looked like a nerf, but it was actually a buff
---
It's because it just filled a random person playing killer
---
Actually 5 hooks cause of survivors being forced off hook and Survivors don't do gens no more.
---
I'm talking about when you've got an easy hit on a survivor that's the same health state as the one you hooked but you intentionally chase the one you hooked even though they're further away to kill them faster. Kinda homo if you ask me.
---
Not sure how you came to that conclusion from what I said.
---
Clown's weakness IS his lack of map control. Plus he doesn't slow the game down for survivors at all. Both these points won't apply to new freddy, so to me he seems like an improved Clown mixed with Hag and Plague (unless skill checks prove to be too efficient at waking survivors up and they actually won't ever need to run to the clock). But, new freddy won't have a oneshot-addon like Clown, so there's that.
---
So, you're shit talking someone's video that you haven't even seen? Cool.
---
For anyone wanting to know what happens; he does a gen grab Spirit build, and anytime he goes to grab someone they miraculously have left the gen and run across the map despite just activating Discordance.
---
Yea he is which is why he has the opinions that he has by playing high rank survivor and killer but im saying some people on this sub don‚Äôt like him probably because they have only ever played survivor and have stayed like mid rank or something and disagree with him when he says there are only 2 maybe 3 viable killers.
---
The Wraith outfit that just came with that Feng outfit is available with Iridescent Shards so...
---
How was it a buff I mean BT got a buff where the deep wounds now are not depleted in terror radius but other than that he is slower at everything he used to do so fast
---
Because failing skill checks still wake people up and there is now no penalty for staying asleep, aside from Freddys long ass teleport being usable more frequently, which will disappear as survivors die. With this kind of stuff in his power is still way too weak.
---
1. dont hide ur score
---
2. we cant say freddy is bad until we try him
---
3. ur just angry about freddy nerfs but u still dont know shit about him, do u know when freddy hits someone, the hitted survivor gets asleep instantly?
---
Nah man you did your best
---
Sometimes people that use ruin also run DH.
---
Yes, those people still exist.
---
Only if you get lucky with skill checks. You are asleep for at least 1/2 the trial if not more. Plus, 25% of the trial sleeping &gt; 10% of the trial sleeping.
---
Buying David? He's a free character, came paired with the Huntress.
---
So Legions power, the whole reason people play them, is to move fast hit and several people. If they need the main aspect of the power it's worth complaining about. I don't care that much about the move speed nerf. It's the 4 second self stun every single time you use your power. 115 is basically meaningless considering 4 of the top 5 killers are 110 or less. I'm not saying old Legion was healthy I'm saying they went too far with nerfs and then nerfed them again before they hit live.
---
Well we dont even know how he plays yet
---
I always take that stuff light-heartedly, kinda like Monto. If you watch them more you realize most of the time they're just fucking around.
---
T H I S I S N O T H O W T H E F O R M A T W O R K S
---
Well yes if it is that kinda situation then yeah makes sense and I understand your perspective.
---
Personally I never run self heal because I don‚Äôt see the value in it as others. Would honestly run iron will but I‚Äôm lazy to lvl jake.
---
Not to mention that the red snares are easy as hell to see.
---
Also super loud, great for no heartbeat shenanigans
---
I won't change my mind. I refuse to accept this mindset that if I'm not having fun, it's the other player's fault because its obviously *their* job to make sure that I have fun in *my* video game.
---
&gt;Fun is subjective and every player is responsible for their own fun.
---
Another quote from my comment. If I'm not having fun, I have no one to blame but myself. Because playing a video game that you aren't enjoying is pretty stupid, my man.
---
What add ons do you have?
---
Buuuuuuuuuuut that sound ;(
---
I saw a spreadsheet with lots of different killer and survivor builds to try last week, but now I can't find it. I thought it was under the useful links tab on this subreddit but it isn't. Does anyone know what I'm talking about and where to find it?
---
Yeah, I've been on Brave's stream, he's a great guy. I'm also the same way. I have TTV in my name, because let's face it, I'm not popular like AngryPug \*shudder\*, Puppers, HybridPanda and CahlaFlour. I shouldn't be. I just started streaming 4 months ago. That being said, I've cultivated an amazing community of people who aren't toxic. I expect, just like brave, to get Mori'd, tunneled and face camped. I invite the Mori's actually, cause they're fun and add a bit of urgency after that first hook. But I will always at least say GG. If I'm tilted, I'll just leave the chat. There have been a few times when I get salty, mainly because of lag switching or if someone said something rude to me in chat cause I'm a sensitive little girl, but I try extremely hard to not be toxic, because toxic streamers gave ALL streamers a bad name.
---
*cough* illusion *cough*
---
"I didn't say it activates as much." I'm just mentioning that it's still a strong and commonly used perk. I don't know why people are so adamant that it's not.
---
Big ooof right thee
---
Sad to say it at rank 2 a blendette on coldwind only had to stop moving for a moment and then just 180... or at least I think that's what she did... I dont know... she vanished...
---
What's QoL?
---
I was playing a match once and whenever I was in the cornfield I would randomly encounter someone and would be like ‚Äúoh hey there‚Äù
---
Also one more thing ummm so if you hit survivors they are put to sleep just confirmed on the forums
---
I‚Äôve said before I watch True to try and get little tips and tricks to get better. He takes it more seriously. Monto I watch for laughs cause his is more shit talking and messing around.
---
It won't take hours to watch others play. It'll take minutes.
---
and fall asleep very easy too, and we dont know how good the snairs will be, so dont say its bad
---
As is tradition.
---
You all know the drill, prepare for the bunch of topics saying too strong/too weak with expert armchair survivors and killers giving their expert opinion on the killer economy.
---
I mean if you want high quality well desgined outfits you just gotta spend the 1080 auric cells. I mean ik basically all cool skins can only be bought witv shards but these are the ones where more effort went into and they kinda have to pay the Designers too. If 1080 is too much, just buy one piece of the cosmetic and combine it with other ones (which often looks better anyways)
---
When I saw this on the stream I thought it looked so dope!
---
Is that for all traps or was this just a one off bug?
---
This argument is basically the two halfs of the DBD community. Theres the jaded people who got tired of playing by unspoken rules and honor codes, and play for their own fun, sometimes at the expense of others.
---
Then theres people who try and make the game fun for both sides.
---
Both of yall are corect in your own way. He's right that the other sides fun isnt always your concern. And youre right that that doesnt mean you have to ignore the other side.
---
[just gonna leace this here](https://youtu.be/FgS50Y06bnY)
---
This is not a complaint. It's just very convenient.
---
Also, it's not better this way :)
---
I sware to gourd if that works, I'm going to feel like a moron
---
Then again I've only played legion I a couple of kyf matches
---
i feel that he would be easier to play as, but very fun, idk we'll see on tuesday
---
*shittin in the tall grass*
---
Thanat doesn't add enough time to be worth using. And instead of being bad if played as intended they just get be bad all the time now.
---
did u played the new freddy version, because u look pretty secure what are u saying
---
He can still see sleeping survivors. Just not out of his terror radius but rather in it so it helps with predicting loops and has some mindgame potential
---
I don't want to rain on any parades, but it's definitely not the case. The box that takes off your trap is picked at random and no other box will take off the trap. It's not just the furthest box, you can test this pretty easily if you'd like.
---
The "a little bit like the jigsaw boxes" just refers to having an object in the world that wakes you up.
---
Edited my post. Guess I misheard them when they said that.
---
because 115% movement speed, and chases are shorter now.
---
&gt;makes sence to me
---
Gotta love that the skins cost twice as much as the characters do too.
---
Every killer is a bad killer except nurse billy and spirit anyway so ü§∑
---
Myers will always spook me. I‚Äôm over there being a survivor and doing gens, making sure things are going ok when I turn around and BOOM AAAAHHHH
---
BECAUSE I'M NEW AND GHOST FACE SCREAM ASSHOLE IS OP AS FUCK AND I REFUSE TO PLAY ANY GAMES THAT HE IS THE KILLER.
---
Hold up you mean both are injured? Well that changes it a little bit. if the rescuer has less hooks I‚Äôll go for them instead, but if the hooked one has less hooks left... they still my priority. I go for whoever is injured first, less hooks comes second.
---
Are they injured?
---
Not my target.
---
My target.
---
Crossing path
---
Who has less hooks left? (Both are inured in this situation)
---
If it‚Äôs the Currently hooked
---
My target
---
If it‚Äôs the Rescuer
---
What if both have the same hook amount?
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter at that point, random choice time!
---
The fact you didn't even read it means you won't acknowledge something that is against your opinion and that is disgusting.
---
I did neither of those things, just simply used double Cooldown addons and you can almost instantly be back on Survivors.
---
If I didn't do that I'd use a Cooldown and a Speed Addon to instantly give a second, third and fourth frenzy hit. Both were infinitely easier and faster than current Legion. 
---
If you can't see that then you have issues.
---
I'm pretty sure it does check it, I'm not at my PC to check rn
---
I did read just not if this were true. So I apologize for that but the point still fucking stands. You‚Äôre arguing against a guy who‚Äôs only stating that keys were counterable and now they‚Äôre not by grabs. There‚Äôs no opinion there so there‚Äôs no point in your whole argument assuming that he thinks it‚Äôs unfair because he‚Äôs pointing out a fact. He said multiple times I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs unfair I‚Äôm just stating a fact and yet you actually said that he doesn‚Äôt understand the discussion yet he‚Äôs not talking about making any changes to keys. Merely that they were counterable by grabs and now they‚Äôre not. There‚Äôs no cry in their to change or fix it and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs been saying the whole time yet you‚Äôre assuming more into it.
---
I'm more mad because old Freddy didn't need a whole lot of tweaks to be viable. Instead, the devs went and scrapped his entire kit, making him lose his theme of a tracking, stall, and stealth killer.
---
Hitting people puts people to sleep. It was cofirmed on the forums.,
---
He‚Äôs not op he is strong. So glad they aren‚Äôt afraid to make that anymore.
---
I still think they should buff his vault speed and Feral Frenzy speed or reduce his fatigue time from 4 seconds to 3.5 seconds.
---
Also, they should rework some of Legion's add-ons, because add-ons like Frank's Mix Tape are useless now.
---
You should also learn to read because one a-fucking-gain he‚Äôs only said they were counterable by grabs and now they‚Äôre not it‚Äôs not an agenda to change the grab.
---
Don't forget the gen teleport power becomes more and more useless as more and more gens are completed.
---
Except they‚Äôre still very counterable, just like any other item.
---
I AGREE COMPLETELY.  I LOVE THE GAME, BUT THE TOXIC PART OF THE COMMUNITY CAN RALLY REMOVE THE FUN.
---
Camping is when a killer is still on the map when hooking a survivor
---
He isnt even out yet dont get your hopes high up
---
Holy shit nice
---
The run time on the video is 11 seconds. That‚Äôs what the jokes about
---
What does the cost of the game and then having to buy the characters individually fund then?
---
Unpopular opinion: the multiplicative time to wake up will be as annoying as old legion mending.
---
That is still very true but that‚Äôs not the point he‚Äôs making. He didn‚Äôt say that they were now uncounterable and if he‚Äôs saying that then he‚Äôs stupid the only thing in correlation here is that they were once counterable by grabs and now they‚Äôre not.
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZUUPPPPPPPPPPP
---
Could be a lot of reasons :
---
Chases are too short /losing chases
---
Staying near a hooked survivor
---
Generators are completed or a majority are completed
---
Not using killers ability
---
Just thanks. \^\^'
---
No one but the devs / playtesters have tried new Freddy. But what I HAVE played is current Freddy at purple ranks and have gotten some success. Now I'll admit I'm not red rank, but if you want gameplay of Freddy at red ranks, I know someone who makes videos of that sort. I'll share them with you if you want.
---
If I had to guess, long chase times? As a killer, allowing the survivor to lead you in a chase for too long results in less chaser points.
---
Well he has the best gen control in the Game now so unless his power is on a cooldown of above 30 seconds he‚Äôs not gonna be shit. Might be nerfed a bit because you know the devs but
---
I did. It was a good video
---
I'll wait until he comes out, but my first impression is that he seems kind of lackluster. Those traps looked not great and the tp has a long cooldown and is telegraphed. Sleep also seems easy to get out of and if you're awake he's an m1 killer who can tp every 45 seconds. I just generally don't like this recent trend of giving the survivors total control over the killers power.
---
You‚Äôre not the person who was making the argument so you can‚Äôt really say what the person was saying or was not saying. They still weren‚Äôt counterable by grabs. If someone was able to use a key, the killer wasn‚Äôt close enough to get a grab anyway. Keep going off tho, it‚Äôs funny to watch this.
---
What do you mean?
---
if you aren‚Äôt gaining point in any way you start to accumulate crows which gives the a visual and audio que where you‚Äôre at.
---
If you stay in one spot for too long without doing an interaction (like healing or doing a gen.) you will get AFK crows. They will circle you and let the killer know where you are until you move.
---
Also, he implied that they were uncounterable now when he said they removed grabs and said grabs were a counter to keys. Therefore, if they removed grabs, by his logic, keys are uncounterable. Jesus fucking Christ.
---
Good, I hope they don't change that because survivors already have more ways to wake up from the dream world.
---
Wow I like this, he actually seems fun to play now. I will finally level him up.
---
Stefan can fuck my asshole any time
---
115 is basically meaningless.
---
If been using self care for 3 years beech just try and stop me
---
I never said that. And the only characters you need money to buy are the licensed ones. You don‚Äôt HAVE to buy anything.
---
Oof! Prime reason why I quit playing Huntress lol waaaay to easy to dodge
---
I assume a brown one will give you fake pallets, then some higher-tier ones will provide additional effects to them
---
It completely reworks Freddy
---
Did you make these? If so, thanks! I have friends that play but don't watch the dev stream so it'll be super easy to just send this to them. Very helpful!
---
I play on ps4 and i never had fps problems on any map.
---
Ok then you can‚Äôt be saying what he‚Äôs saying or not saying but go off. You‚Äôre other reply was saying that because keys are no longer counterable by grabs he‚Äôs implying that they‚Äôre uncounterable but he‚Äôs never once said that so go off too I guess. Funny how you can assume what someone is saying but I can‚Äôt.
---
Red ranks was tough years ago but now no, I already got paired against rank 1 SWF before and got a easy 4k and I had no perks.
---
For survivors, Items, Addons, and Offerings, all of which are shared.
---
For Killers, Offerings which are shared, and Addons which for obvious reasons are not shared. They still ALL appear on one bloodmarket though.
---
I thought shorter chases give you more points when you get to the survivor.
---
i faced freddy last night, i‚Äôm new to the game so i didn‚Äôt do very good but thank god if i get him again my boyfriend can help me.
---
yea you are missing something yea...
---
Name checks out
---
Dr. HeeHee Man Carter
---
How are you only level 13..
---
Notice how he said a counter not the counter so by your logic he‚Äôs not implying they‚Äôre uncounterable because grabs were just A counter to keys but I guess I can‚Äôt say that because I‚Äôm not him. I can‚Äôt make my own inference like you are.
---
I STARTED 2 WEEKS AGO AND ALREADY DON'T WANT TO PLAY THE GAME ANYMORE, SO THERE YOU GO.
---
SWF are very altruistic and will stop everything they are doing and go to the hook the second somebody is on there
---
I‚Äôm level 113 mate i prestiged
---
Great argument. You can't even answer a simple question
---
Ah. My bad. Hadn't quite reached that long into the game, lol.
---
It's way too early to tell but I think that these changes are good as they make Freddy more diverse and fun while not making him op. Each and every of his new powers are not even strong if taken alone.
---
does not help you to reach end game. Shit tier
---
Devs: *fixes legion voice bug*
---
Legion: Thanks, we now instantly down with a common add-on and Doctors shocks injure now
---
Fix a bug add a couple more
---
Playing new killers might be miserable with this, not having enduring, bbq etc. is gonna suck.
---
As it is rn on pc and consoles you can save up points and get a lot of perks as the character comes out.
---
:(
---
So thats the only thing to rate a perk after?
---
So you would think...
---
I dunno, I kind of liked being able to put a survivor to sleep, and having enough time to take a piss and come back by the time I was allowed hit them. 
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I didn't get hit by a single DS since the rework and I'm not exaggerating. Not a single one
---
Get were gonna live forever from david to get more BP
---
I saw a bunch of people saying that in the chat.  I really believe survivors want killers that have rubber knives to just play tag with.
---
In response to someone saying that the hatch spawn thing adds intensity, and they responded with ‚Äúit is, but the problem is that people with keys become completely uncounterable. They will get a free escape unless you‚Äôre running Franklins.... they should re add hatch grabs... so it‚Äôs balanced for both sides.‚Äù (direct quote) If that isn‚Äôt implying that hatch grabs were the counter to keys, im sorry but I can‚Äôt help you understand anything. Do you know what implication means? At all? You don‚Äôt have to literally state something, but based on what you say and the context of it, you can imply the meaning of something. He didn‚Äôt have to literally state that grabs were the counter to keys and without them keys are uncounterable, but he did imply that based on what he said and how he said it. I can keep grabbing his direct quotes and help explain them to you, if it‚Äôs really that hard for you to read.
---
regarding meta perk yea.
---
Imporant to add that that hitting awake survivors puts then to sleep.
---
Tbh at this point most games I‚Äôm familiar with have their high quality skins around that $10 price range
---
haha it‚Äôs ALWAYS them, they think they‚Äôre the shit when they‚Äôre actually hot steaming garbage
---
I agree. I think it makes her scarier to play against. Just hearing her hum and not knowing where exactly she is, knowing she could have a hatchet aimed right at your head. It's moments like that that help make the game as fun as it is.
---
Because I‚Äôm referencing his literal statements. Are you nearly done yet?
---
Ur rank 20 cause ur not doing things in game say gens or unhooking or being chased, if u just hide in the bushes all match ur not really gunna gain rank
---
go for Laurie because DS
---
Its definitely not meta, but neither does it get close to shit tier
---
Pretty much.
---
I will say right now that if you enjoyed old Freddy you are actually factually wrong. This may get me a lot of downvotes but I genuinely think that old Freddy was extremely unhealthy for the game. It was not fun for anyone for their to be a Killer whos power essentially boiled down to stalling the game for as long as possible and doing absolutely nothing while the game is stalled. Freddy in all aspects was terribly designed and while there were parts of his kit that was fun for the Killer (it did feel great to be able to track people from across the map) his design was just extremely unhealthy as a whole.
---
At least Legion I can vaguely understand not liking their change, primarily because they were literally a brain-dead free win Killer before their rework. (Especially with Frank's Mix Tape and Stab Wound Study) But Freddy in all aspects was unhealthy for the game. Unfun for Killers, unfun for Survivors.
---
New Freddy looks great and I'm excited to see how he performs in a live environment. I'm honestly quite willing to become a Freddy main now as he looks very interesting. They took a bad concept and are making something very good with it, as opposed to Legion where they took a meh concept and did generally make it worse. (Even if Legion is "healthier" for the game currently.)
---
SAME THING HAPPENEDS ON X1, I CAN'T STAND THAT KILLER HE'S TOTAL BULLSHIT.
---
Hitting awake survivors does put them to sleep so that will help in that area. 
---
Also waking up takes longer, still does skill checks, and hes harder to track with the lullbay.
---
Freddie's teleport activated every 40 seconds. You can only use those illusionary pallets and traps if they're asleep, which takes 60 seconds, or 90 if they wake up from the alarm clock. Freddy can only have 8 traps at a time. Freddy can only have traps, or pallets. You can't have both at the same time, it works through add-ons.
---
I‚Äôm actually working on a far more in-depth (text) legion guide that may change your mind on how you view them. It‚Äôs gonna take a while though.
---
It does. u/SentientSickness is just a moron :^)
---
Ahhhh God damn I'd love to see them smash together all the survivors items and add-ons pools on regular platforms
---
I mean..hes better then he is now. At least he doesnt need to wait to hit survivors,m and does have some stleath. 
---
Not to mention he can still teleport without needing to be alseep so he has least has some pressure.
---
That wasn‚Äôt incirion. You think I‚Äôm defending that other guy? The fuck. I‚Äôm talking about the guy who said keys were counterable by hatch grabs and now they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre not the same person. Read usernames dude. Go ahead and keep grabbing direct quotes from someone I‚Äôm not trying to defend it‚Äôll definitely work.
---
The initial purchase of the game funds the development cost, the killers help keep the team who keep the game running paid, and the skins also fund the team after paying for the artist. People aren‚Äôt just going to keep a competitive game like this running for funsies.
---
Yea I know he's drastically changing.. but is losing the aura read part of that?
---
I mean, if it was as easy as a click of a button, it would be a fun addition, but considering the work that goes into it, no, not at all. I don‚Äôt think the design of Art‚Äôs look is even that interesting either.
---
Though, I did think Art reminded me of a kind of puppet or Jack in the Box. A puppet kind of killer could be interesting but that‚Äôs unfortunately not what he has been marketed or created to be.
---
You can disable his power by pushing the Active Ability button again.
---
Yup that's exactly how it is, If I don't play by Survivor rules I'm not a good killer lol.
---
Not really, camping is when the killer is still on the map after the match has started.
---
Yeah üòÇüòÇ
---
YeahüòÇ
---
I know, I just wanted to vouch for my favourite healing perk.
---
Camping is if you have ever played killer
---
Was you the killer or the 8
---
Honestly the maps from now on need doors so killers can kick it in
---
How are these perks toxic? I kinda like them as killers because both of them waste time. Sprint burst doesn't let them run everytime if they want to save the boost and selfcare is pretty shit because it takes so long to heal. It's mandatory if you play solo but don't take it if you play with friends
---
If you made these you are genuinely the funniest human, being you deserve real gold
---
How‚Äôd ya die though m8
---
BunnytheHutt was the one who made that quote you just quoted. And when you said if that were true keys were always uncounterable to win incirion said keys were countered by hatch grabs not anymore because he thought you were saying pre update keys were uncounterable. Two different people two different agendas. He even said it.
---
This might be the funniest thing I‚Äôve seen
---
I think New Legion is healthier for the game as a whole but the problem is that they were vastly overnerfed in other areas when the core issues (Moonwalk Exploit and being "Nurse for stupid people") were already fixed.
---
Put bluntly:
---
* Why does Legion only move 10% faster when using Feral Frenzy? (125% from 115%, as opposed to 110% to 130% pre-rework.)
---
* Why can't Legion see scratch marks or blood when using Feral Frenzy? They're a chase Killer so why can't they track while chasing? More importantly why can't they see scratches / blood *after* using their power akin to Spirit?
---
* Why does Legion stun themselves for 40 years after canceling their power. This downside was already enough with old Legion so why did they have to nerf it even more with new Legion?
---
* Why does their power take 8 years to recharge?
---
The literaly only aspects of Legion that got better after the rework were Iridescent Button and the various pin addons (Smiley Pin, Defaced Smiley Pin, The Legion Pin.) And the thing is that the pins simply went from "literally worthless" to "barely useable if you have literally nothing else."
---
The best part is that after the rework the old pins might've actually been useful to let Legion chase better lmfao.
---
his snares look like trash if he can't increase the slow, looks like dream pallets will be needed to even do well
---
Are you always this pedantic?
---
Im not saying these perks are toxic or anything, but you need to admit that a lot of toxic SWF groups use them to annoy killer
---
Survivor: sucks and gets killed
---
Survivor: Pssshhhhhhh it's not me being shit, it's the killer being good. NO FUCKIN SKILL ALLOWED! NERF ALL KILLERS! REMOVE KILLERS! TAKE AWAY KILLER PERKS!
---
Billy still has better gen control since his chainsaw has no cooldown while the gen tp has a huge one
---
Oh I personally think play with your food is!
---
Someone posted it on reddit in 2 parts. Just scroll a bit, it s not far
---
The fancy Jeff outfit wasn‚Äôt paid, and that‚Äôs good enough for me!
---
My teammates did no gens and got insta-killed. We had no gens done and I could not find the hatch ;(
---
I don't know Im happy they're changing Freddy and his changes make me excited, but idk he doesn't feel like Freddy Krueger to me anymore, Freddy Krueger uses his creativity to kill in his movies and yeah some of these are creative but it really is just him changing the way survivors interact with the environment. Not to mention he seems like an entirely add on based killer since most of his add-ons give him more stuff to do/use
---
Some things are obvious. You don't always have to use it to judge whether its broken. I'm not saying that Freddy is that way, but this is a bad argument.
---
Y u bully lol
---
They said yes
---
I do think it‚Äôs a nice addition but more so for Freddy than huntress.   Yes it is a scary thing to not know where she‚Äôs coming from but it breaks immersion just a lil bit bc 
---
I mean she herself is the one humming and you would know where someone is (for the most part) if they were humming around you
---
For the love of god just press the ‚Äúshare‚Äù button next time.
---
Community: Buff Freddy! Devs: *buff Freddy*  Community: *surprised pikachu
---
Would be a cool touch for more indoor maps in the future. Survivors slam the door for a stun, killers kick it down.
---
Is that a paper plate for the mask?
---
Camping is playing as killer obviously
---
That perk would be nice although i need to buy the dlc in order to get her
---
No computer to move it from fb to reddit and ps4 won‚Äôt ‚Äúshare‚Äù to reddit so i gotta make due
---
Iron Maiden?
---
Haha my wife doubted me but I said the DBD sub will appreciate the effort I put into this!

---
I mean, how much BP do you get by having his perk ?
---
Yeah sometimes it doesn't matter how good you are if your team is shit.
---
Rin seems pretty hype about it too.
---
No it's some kind of EVA foam my friend gave to me
---
just buy freedy and his addons decide what killer you want to be. easy 4 in 1. jokes aside, his teleporting to gen is freaking cool
---
Yeah you need to use the same 8 or 9 perks at red ranks if you wanna survive. You‚Äôre clearly an immersed Claud the way you‚Äôre talking.
---
Sure yup. All he had was wall hack. Suuuuure.
---
if you can, straight up buy Laurie, DS is 100% worth using, especially at lower ranks you'll get tunneled and camped a lot, so this perk is basically your best friend
---
lmao, they want nurse tier killers only. you will see them again flip there shit in the BTP
---
Thx
---
Start the trial on a 60 second timer. Once the timer finishes, or Freddy smacks you, you fall asleep. While asleep you can be slowed by dream snares where hands will attempt to grab you and you will scream. Or (with add-ons) these snares can be switched out for fake pallets that explode in bliss when thrown down. Freddy can also channel his ability to teleport to a generator. The gen will start bleeding (certain add-ons make all gens bleed) and Freddy will crawl out of the ground.
---
it is ok that it can be purchased only, but the price is too high honestly
---
FUCK THAT INSIDIOUS CAMPING SPIRIT. STUPID BITCH.
---
I loved the scream movies but also hated how clumsy the killers were      The only reason I thought scream 4 was a decent movie for the killers was due to the pure aggression they showed
---
Yeah that sucks
---
But he has the best stall, tracking, and stealth with Mind games aplenty. He isn't fantastic, but he's definitely mid tier.
---
Update even trasheier than I was early
---
Oh ok that makes for a much better mask
---
Camping is when you think about playing as the killer
---
Last 10 games killer just spawns on top of my face
---
P.S sorry about no flair! On my phone without the app and it's almost annoyingly difficult to figure out. Pleas forgiv :}
---
Imagine having to keep track of all this compared to Hillbilly, Nurse, or even Shape. They're going to need to create a whole new difficulty tier for Freddy.
---
Simple! Freddy can‚Äôt snare or trick you with pallets. And certain add-ons slow down progress. He isn‚Äôt out yet so stop assuming he‚Äôs gonna be shit.
---
Or they try to get that last gen done first so adrenaline can kick in when they get a teammate off the hook.
---
Perk 1: thats just calm spirit.
---
Perk 2: that would be better served as a buff to small game. To counter thrill.
---
Perk 3: this only really affects nurse every killer can just go M1. 
---
Try again.
---
A killer will not ‚Äúalways‚Äù go for the unhooked survivor. Anyone killer with some empathy will understand what getting tunneled feels like so they will not tunnel. Also to the people that do tunnel there should always be a threat of DS and people who don‚Äôt get punished for playing unfairly. And about ‚Äúreckless survivors.‚Äù Just hit them and leave them on the ground and continue what you where doing. If anything it helps you add pressure to the game and secured you and easy down
---
Nah I see whole bodies still, played a little bit ago
---
owo
---
Oh wow my life has changed for the better thank you u/ReeSyDence
---
Stay away from rank 7 got it lol jk
---
You are only looking at his weakness while ignoring his strengths. Yes, the dream transition is annoying, but it does not completely counteract the advantages that his ability gives him. Tracking survivors and stalling the game is still powerful.
---
Then you have literally no reason to be discussing with me so drop it? If the issue is settled leave it alone.
---
Because deep wounds doesn't do anything, unless you've got blade addons. The movespeed is barely faster than base walking speed, and if you actually try to chain deepwounds, by the time you reach the second survivor the first one will have finished mending. All you succeeded in doing was wasting your own time.
---
Now, swap to hillbilly and you get a killer with no cooldown (which legion has), good movespeed/map pressure (which legion doesn't have), an instadown (which legion doesn't have), and the ability to essentially break pallets almost instantly (which legion doesn't have - even with iridescent button, hillbilly breaks pallets quicker).
---
A bit of backstory: Was hooked while playing as Feng and when I got rescued I got "stuck" in the hooked animation. Got hooked early~ game so I spent quite some time like this. Eventually, after changing my flahslight for a toolbox, Feng started moving her right arm... only her right arm. I got a bunch of screenshots of it so maybe I'll do an album and post it here later or something like that (I felt that this was the best one though).
---
BTW, yes, my pc is indeed a potato.
---
Lmao I‚Äôm really bad so stay at rank 7 üòÇ
---
If you balance around Solos, SWF will break the game.
---
If you balance around SWF, Solos will be somewhat ineffective in comparison.
---
**One of these is clearly preferable**
---
You're sacrificed as soon as you return to land. It is the exact same scenario if you are mid air from a long drop when the collapse timer runs out.
---
Someone is obviously a freddy main
---
The only skin killers really get to see is their weapon lol
---
Except you can't watch someone play for a few minutes then seamlessly incorporate their way of playing into your own...
---
I couldn't prestige until I got those off honestly, I had like 4 Survivor Puddings, 2 bloody streamers and one Gateau on Legion and I didn't want to prestige him until I got rid of them cause it would of felt like a waste otherwise.
---
I have no plans on prestiging Bubba but looks like I'm gonna have to learn to play him to make the most out of those 8 gateaus, 3 bloody streamers and 6 Survivor puddings it decided to bestow upon him.
---
wallhacks and 7 seconds of god mode for survivors lol
---
We might just see each other maybe I'm at rank 12 survivor and 15 killer.
---
YOUR PART OF THE PROBLEM!
---
It should be in the middle really. So it's not unfair for either side. Dont want a newbie going against a rank 3 killer or a rank 18 killer going against a rank 3 survivor.
---
wait... best stall?? u forgot piggy, and best mindgames? u forgot spirit
---
and best stealth? literally myers, wraith and pig does it better...
---
fuck this community dude lol
---
Why does this give me the impression that Freddy will hit survivors to sleep and then they will have to hit them a second time to injure, and a third time to down them...
---
And your proud of this...
---
Eh, he's in my top five.
---
I know a strong killer when I see it, and this ain't it chief.
---
Ones a $60 game with dlc
---
give me an advantage that is not the reduce speed while doing stuff that literally only lasts like 20 seconds
---
YES, OFFICER THIS COMMENT HERE! HE/SHE IS USING LOWER CASE LETTERS! DISGUSTING
---
It's not that hard to keep track of at all. We haven't even seen the performance yet. The only difference is that you can either have snares, or pallets, that's it.
---
This is why xbox is better ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Freddy works fine at every rank as he is now aside from the unfortunate games where survivors get good skillcheck RNG. If you don't lose 3 generators in the first minute before you get all of your sleeps off, you set yourself up for a decent midgame with delayed generator / heal times. If you can get a kill before 3-4 gens done, you will likely win because freddy is a master at slugging, especially when combined with sloppy butcher.
---
Run the Green Dress addon and watch as your games are 20 minutes long, if the survivors don't disconnect from being slugged the whole match.
---
Personnally I feel that they don‚Äôt have the time to reach a loop, but a good idea to prevent that is to try to spot the most obvious loop they can go to, and uncloak between them and this loop, and bodyblock if you can. That‚Äôs why I run both movement speed add-ons.
---
For the build, I either go full hex, or I play BBQ, Nurses, Mangled, and Ruin (I‚Äôve yet to try PGTW, i think it might be better than ruin now, especially if I play the add-on that let me see generator progress). Make Your Choice can be decent as well I think. Also, I almost only hit with surprise attacks, I find it easier to mindgames and stuff.
---
The hardest is to build momentum at the beginning, however once you have the momentum, you‚Äôre a beast.
---
BING BONG

---
they also forgot to say that if freddy hits u, u get asleep instantly
---
No it was explained that you will get hit and be injured and asleep as well
---
Whenever that happens I tell my friends to go do gens while I keep him occupied with his stupid totem that he overly guards.
---
Stealth, stall, good m1 mindgames and the best tracking, slugging and stall in the game. If you focus on sleeping, and switching targets you will slow the game down to a crawl, max out your bp and get everyone down. The reason everyone calls freddy shit is because they play him like a normal m1 killer, they sleep someone, jerk off for 7 seconds because they think that they cant do anything in that time and tunnel that one survivor for the entire game, then complain he's trash in the post game chat. People who think Freddy is shit honestly need to git gud at him.
---
Holy shit this is awesome. Thanks!
---
There's no thematic/gameplay reason to actually put people to sleep now other than using traps and stuff. I find the red traps themselves are far too easy to see, so the pallet add-on might as well be baseline. I don't like that it's basically a mishmash of other killer powers, and that the gen teleport thing diminishes in power as the trial goes on. There's so many issues with it.
---
appreciate you üôèüèº
---
Stall is still Freddy. Pig has 4 traps. Freddy can infinitely apply his stall.
---
I never said best mindgames. I said mindgames aplenty. Of course Spirit has the best, but Freddy has more than most killers outside Spirit.
---
Total invisibility makes your stealth good. Plus his dream mist + fog + size + smaller tr make him stealthy even in dream world.
---
Sounds like what they did with Deathgarden.
---
Same here, was there a red bar in your lobby OP? I've noticed that's when shit really hits the fan.
---
I agree. This also means gen rushing isn‚Äôt toxic
---
People like you who complain about people like that are just as bad, stop spamming the sub with this shit
---
Don't "dude" me.
---
I'm not going to bitch about it, but I'm not a fan of the rework. Freddy is mediocre as he is now, but it isn't because of his base kit. He's mediocre because he has bad numbers.
---
I enjoy killers like Freddy / Trapper / Wraith the most because they're mostly just M1 killers who don't need to use powers a whole lot. I'm not a fan of the rework because it turns freddy into something else.
---
Don‚Äôt forget that hitting survivors puts them too sleep confirmed by the devs on the forums
---
Httiong survivors will instaly put them to sleep.
---
Ty, btw what do you think is the way to go build on a survivor ?
---
Yes... yes I am

but hey, no more: unhook teamates infront of ya, when u dowen someone at the gates and everyone starts to heal the downed survivor and escape, gens being repaired infront of you, horrible dream world vision, 7 seconds to hut someone, no map pressure, no more being hindered by ur power

Where‚Äôs the fire? Didn‚Äôt you tell me to keep on going because you were having fun watching this? You made a mistake and because of that you want me to drop it? You went off on this man because you assumed he was BunnytheHutts when he was just stating a fact on a mistake. And you went off assuming his intents. I assume his intents and I have no right to be talking. Oh but since I obviously don‚Äôt know how to read like you do I can‚Äôt understand what you mean by leave it alone. What was the point of this whole discussion? Oh right me telling you that the guy was only stating a fact and there was no reason for you to continue to go off on him. So I still have a reason to discuss this with you whether he made a mistake or not. So the issue isn‚Äôt settled because not only did you rant on me being fucking smug about it you ranted to a guy on YOUR mistake as well but I‚Äôm supposed to drop it? You can continue to prove people wrong and expect more answers for your amusement but when you‚Äôre wrong the other person has to drop it?
---
I straight up don't believe you got to red ranks on 2 kills a game whilst camping one of em, just straight up don't believe you
---
u can play all the killer with m1 tho, still with the reworked freddy
---
Then just leave lmao. Not everyone's going to get out every game. Sometimes you have to leave a man behind. Borrowed does need to be fixed though; no terror radius killers can easily camp.
---
Yeah you can
---
Huntress is very strong in chases. One of her main counterplays was the fact the lullaby was directional, and you could avoid getting into a chase. It's the main reason she has a 20 meter terror radius; if you read her lullaby wrong she finds you and potentially can down you very quickly.
---
With the directional lullaby gone, they should bring her terror radius higher, so you have some indication of her direction before it is way too late.
---
A ranged killer with a 20 meter terror radius is not okay, and with M&amp;A she can practically get in melee range before you ever hear a heartbeat.
---

honestly, i dont understand why people now are saying freddy is good... i actually play a lot of freddy, and yea, if u do what are u saying in rank 1, they will wake up very easly and gg...
---
You're welcome to your opinion but I'm going to disagree. I like games to be as long as possible, and I think the current meta of gens being done in 3-4 minutes is what's extremely unhealthy. Needing mobility and instadowns like every other killer we get nowadays is boring as hell, and I think having at least one killer who tremendously slows the game is a breath of fresh air. 
---
Even when I play survivor, I'd much rather run into a Freddy than the 20th hillbilly / nurse / spirit in a row.
---
There's usually never a schedule for the sales. They catch people off guard 99% of the time. But if I HAD to guess it'd be on the next couple Chapter Releases or major event.

IDGAF about what anyone else says, Prove Thyself is baller. It is why I exclusively run my Dwight, Bond, Prove Thyself, Urban Evasion and Small Game (because I find totems then go gen jockey)

Is more like it.
---
How, you can just plant them in front of pallets mid loop and they will be forced to slow vault the upcoming pallet almost confirming a hit
---
You literally just told me to add you to see how good you are lmfao, what are you rambling about
---
thats kinda cringe bro not gonna lie
---
That‚Äôs the ‚Äònewbies‚Äô fault for joining a High ranked players game intentionally though. Meeting in the middle could mean a rank 20 and rank 1 survivor facing a rank 10 killer. In no way is that fair on the killer, yes the tank 20 will be shit but that rank 1 will outplay them so hard. It should be the lowest rank. Otherwise how does a killer get better against people who out play him every time instead of progressional progress?
---
Aura reading is/was still annoying as shit for the survivor. If a Freddy wanted to chase you endlessly he could which made it very hard to wake up because you had to try and wake up close while still inside his terror radius, which revealed your location from the failed skill check and Freddy would just sleep you again.
---
No, Rammstein
---
The killers goal is to kill **2 or more survivors**, not stand in front of one on the hook as the others poke a generator and leave. Camping does not help you kill a survivor faster in the slightest. All it does is confirm one kill on a survivor while you give the other 3 no pressure and all the time in the world to do the remaining generators and laugh at you as they escape.
---
Like I cant even tell if you‚Äôre taking the piss or you actually believe the two are related or comparable. They are completely unrelated
---
True
---
Really his biggest mistake here was dropping and picking up the light as well as the thank you crouch  on such short time
---
You got selected for the beta?
---
Yeah I really enjoy new legion I think they did a very good job reworking him. But he does need some buffs because he is pretty underpowered
---
Recently playing as Ghost Face I discovered the lunge mechanic when swinging your weapon. I've heard this applies to other killers, but have not tested it yet. Holding the attack button will chargw your swing and move you forward more while swiping at the survivor. Killer rank 11 and I didn't learn this until someone told me, lol.
---
She still looks dead. Drowned, even. Nonetheless, I haven't even half the talent it took to make this. Kudos.
---
I literally said I'm doing just as much, generators, unhooking, totems etc. I also lost a pip which isn't supposed to be possible
---
Every killer i play against.
---
You are probably playing him wrong dude. Many Freddy mains do this exact same strat and get consistantly good results with it, it is the best way to play him and utilises his strengths effectively.
---
"Dr. Heehee man Carter" Perfect, beautiful. 10/10
---
I don't always play Feng but when I do it's Ballerina Feng. I think that outfit is worth it.
---
my bad yeah up the ante
---
its effect lategame isn't good enough to justify a perk slot. I think even Wake up is more useful.
---
He isn't the worst killer by any margin. I've mained Freddy since the day he came out and P3'd him within 2 days. People think Freddy is bad because they play him wrong.
---
Freddy has a completely different playstyle to other killers. When you sleep / injure someone, you need to abandon the chase and do that to everyone else. If all 4 survivors are slept and you're using the Green Dress addon, with them injured / sloppy butcher, they aren't going to do gens, you'll have mapwide vision of them, and they are going to remain injured.
---
The only way freddy loses a match is if he loses too many generators before he gets the train going, or if survivors get great skillcheck rng.
---
Doctor, Legion, and arguably Trapper are all worse than Freddy is in his current state.
---
Right and that's why Hag, Spirit, and Huntress move at 110%?
---
SWF already break the game. We deal with it.
---
Adorable! I love it.
---
ok am sorry i was rude but i disagree. Have a nice day
---
I will. Oh, I will.
---
...not it you balance around them...
---
Okay. Guessing it was ridiculously fast before.
---
Good to see you can‚Äôt get out of pallets with killers other than nurse.
---
And those are all good killers despite their speed.
---
So you'll know it's Freddy as soon as the game starts?
---
You don't need to get selected, it's out in Finland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
---
I just changed the Region on my App store.
---
Coldwind intensifies
---
&gt;Billy
---
Try using speed limiter or M1ing people. Billy gets bad emblem points because insta-downing someone isn't considered winning a chase.
---
The dream snares are a really powerful tool for him because they basically let him shut down any loop he wants and he doesn't have to stand still or get slowed down at all to place them.
---
I can't wait honestly. It sounds fun
---
Prove Thyself is, to be honest, a trap disguised as a perk. It's not terrible by itself, but it encourages non-optimal gameplay, similar to Self Care or Dying Light.
---
Working on a generator with another person is not a good idea unless it's the last one or you're trying to prevent a 3-gen scenario.
---
Killer finds 1 person on gen --&gt; 1 person not on gen
---
Killer finds 3 people on gen --&gt; 3 people not on gens
---
Not to mention all the other issues that pop up when survivors group up, like multiple survivors trying to utilize the same loop against the Killer.
---
Yeah, that feels very weird to me. I think the microsleep timer should be hidden until it activates for the first time.
---
Huh. Weird way for a Reddit convo to end.
---
But have a nice day
---
happy dingdong noise in the first panel and angry dingdong noise in the last panel
---
Nice!  Now if only that right side was blocked off to add a strategic element to this.  100% unsafe pallet but do the gen and it becomes a safe pallet?  I'd like those sorts of mechanics.
---
I'd say Meg, Nea, or Dwight. Meg for Adrenaline, Nea for Balanced Landing/Urban Evasion, Dwight for Bond. I personally like Bond and Urban Evasion, whilst Balanced Landing and Adrenaline are pretty well liked by most of the community. Hope this helps!
---
haha yeah he does
---
If I could just waltz around as GF and stalk people down without worrying, I would have 0 terror radius for the entire game and have the ability to ignore literally every health related perk once I expose them. Is that what you want?
---
Really? I knew about it from the start because it is covered in the tutorial. Did you not do it?
---
well, my build is always DS, BT, DH and Bond (usually change Bond with Adrenaline or Iron Will), but at lower ranks i don't recommend this build. 
---
for beginners I'll say Windows of Opportunity (Kate's perk), a really good perk to learn where loops are and get used to the environment around you 
---
Technician (Feng) isn't that great but can help you a lot with hitting greats skillcheck because if you fail, there's 50% chance it won't alert the killer
---
Bond (Dwight) is amazing, you can find teammates to heal or to find them to heal you, can find them to work on gens together, and you can see if they are in a chase or not
---
Lithe (Feng) i think is the best exhaustion perk for beginners 'cause you can't waste it like Sprint Burst or being situational like Balanced Landing
---
Q&amp;Q (Meg) you can do a lot of nice locker jukes with this and the killer will lose you instantly
---
I think Self Care is kind of necessary at lower ranks since killers don't know how to put pressure and you won't waste a lot of time also so you can use Lithe, Bond, Windows (if you have Kate, if not use Q&amp;Q instead) and Self Care
---
Probably to offer some sort of counter play, but IMO they are doing it the wrong way.
---
Yes, exactly, thats totally what I want. Jfc maybe take a bit more time to consider a question next time? I'm asking why they make it so that the Survivors can decide when a killer has their power! If a power doesn't work without that balance wise then maybe rework it.
---
I don't believe you. Nobody counts the amount of times they've been to rank 1 lol. I'm sure you'll deny it to the end, but I guarantee you're not a good killer and that you don't consistently 4k at red ranks.
---
As if survivors needed any more basic counterplay options.
---
ah 
---
i see your a man 
---
who admires the fine arts
---
yeah I've noticed that survivors like to put down killerd a lot, my huntress is stuck at like level 17 until i get the perks i need from other killers like BBQ and Nurses Calling, just putting the bloodpoints i get from playing Billy and Huntress into them. And without the right perks Huntress really struggles, so in those games on big ass maps i usually don't get a single kill because i try to be nice and leave to check a different gen before walking back, giving them lots of time to go for a save with a low movement speed. And then i get survivors in post chat just acting like they're the shit or I'm just shit, kinda annoyimg, but i just move on to the next game because I still love Huntress ;P
---
Actually I‚Äôm a killer main so...
---
If you want BHVR employees to make a living from the game than no. That's probably not enough. If you want, they could make you pay upwards of $15 for all high rarety outfits like Fortnite or Apex. Or you can just except the fact that you are just going to need to buy some outfits you want.
---
Sounds like a problem with your mouse, not the game.
---
Lmao. Actually I have no idea if I did the killer tutorial. I played Survivor for a while because my friends got me into the game. Maybe I didn't think anything of it. I wish I had a full technique to tell you guys about dealing with survivors 360 dodging, but I think that one just builds up naturally.
---
Still on sale if you're on PC.
---
Skillchecks.
---
If multiple Survivors repair the same Generator, a penalty to the Repair Efficiency is applied to all repairing Survivors. The penalty increases with the amount of Survivors partaking in the repair.
---
If 2 Survivors are on the same generator then each Survivor will be repairing at 90% efficiency which is 180% so it's still faster than working on it alone but it's technically better to have everyone on separate generators so you can repair multiple at the same time without a penalty.
---
This is a common bug that has been out since launch. Google dbd M1 bug. It‚Äôs not your mouse.
---
TL;DW: This is just a quick glimpse for people who want to know new dream state and power, it isn't meant to be everything, if you want to know more watch the 30 minute video or read the comments.
---
Survivors start awake and constantly fall asleep, use current methods of failed skill checks and wake up interaction plus you can find an alarm clock on the map when you're asleep.
---
Sleeping no longer has action penalty by default and Freddy no longer sees aura of sleeping survivors. While awake Freddy is invisible outside of a certain range.
---
Freddy can look a generator and channel for several seconds to conjure a husk at the generator and then can choose to teleport to it, generator explodes with blood the whole time.
---
He can place Dream snares (by default) which show up as pools of blood to sleeping survivors, it slows down sleeping survivors that trigger it while making them scream.
---
Freddy can use addons to use Dream pallets instead of snares which can be conjured at any pallet spot without a pallet. Explodes when dropped and activate a dream snare (afaik) and only appears to sleeping survivors.
---
Who care? :)) Base on what you said, you are just a rotten human being who don't know how to respect other people. It's a shame your parent have a such "educated" human being like you right here, cause your parent maybe just like you: "uneducated" and gonna insult everybody they are gay. Oh by the way, i'm gay and i'm proud of who i am. You must be a kid by the way so let me said this to open your brain cause it look like rotten and smelly exactly like a turd: Nobody will be a shame because they are gay :)). So your pathetic attempt to insult me now in vain. And i don't care about grammar darling. It's not my native language by the way lol. Bye kid
---
Freddy sees the noise bubble and rushes over to you. I mean sure you can do it when he's in a chase with somebody else, but if a Freddy wanted to tunnel you in particular for any reason (Like, he never wanted to break chase and was completely dedicated to chasing you) it was impossible to be able to really get away until he downs and hooks you.
---
But there are also killers that want survivors to just stand still, because looping is 'toxic'.
---
I think that these groups only play 1 side, which is a shame.
---
Indeed, as is tunneling
---
A good Freddy would juggle survivors, not tunnel. Your goal is to hide as soon as you break out of the dreamworld.
---
Wait you can go over hag traps when crouching?
---
nop, use your brain cells where trying to discuss with people and reread previous comments.
---
ok einstein
---
If you get hooked early, it‚Äôs your own fault 99% of the time. People who are rank one aren‚Äôt leprechauns that just get lucky every single game - they got better and improved their skill/strategy. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs me (I‚Äôve been hooked early game plenty), but when I have a bad start to a match I don‚Äôt just throw my hands up and say ‚ÄúNothing I could do! Hope the exact same thing doesn‚Äôt happen next game!‚Äù
---
No one can stop you from quitting, but aside from it making you a horrible teammate, you‚Äôll miss out on tons of narrow escapes (best part of the game imo) and learn less about how to improve your game.
---
I sorta wish windows of opportunity counter the pallet thing to make it more useful but I understand why it does not. Freddy is going to be fun to play as
---
"Survivor Found"
---
Cool, news to me
---
Aha, we caught the double standard
---
Except the teleport range has no limit and you can tele to the furthest gen if you wanted to in 5s. Very strong map power that saves you a hell of a lot of time even if it is telegraphed.
---
Also the add-on that effects all gens so you don‚Äôt know which one he is really going to until a few seconds later.
---
I also don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs issue with the traps as if they aren‚Äôt going to trap popular window or loop spots regardless of whether they‚Äôre too visible. You effectively eliminated a loop spot and if they pass through the trap anyway they‚Äôre slowed.
---
Sleep is also now passive and always present and you can waste time finding the alarm clock RNG like Jigsaw boxes or wake up the same as before but you will always be in a state of microsleep.
---
We have a killer that can teleport with no range limit directly to a gen and can apply pressure in a matter of seconds, he can place traps in loop areas and windows that will slow you down, and also has add-ons for loop pallet mindgames and action speed debuffs. Yet he is lackluster to you?
---
Is anything less than Nurse or Hillbilly lackluster or should they truly be the only two killers in the game.
---
At this point people don‚Äôt even know what they want from the game anymore and are so damn hard to please.
---
Killers want counters to looping, mindgame potential, and better map pressure and BHVR literally wraps it up in one neat package and the stream chat was saying they made him even worse ffs.
---
[What the fuck...](https://i.imgur.com/PayeWRM.jpg)
---
Playing legion before and after, it really does make a difference.
---
Patrolling - go from gen to gen searching for people - make sure to double-check if you‚Äôre suspicious
---
oof that would be nice.
---
At tier 3 it‚Äôs 100% more bloodpoints
---
don't be so salty and try to improve yourself
---
I suppose I can understand your situation in the context of another game I play, where they keep adding new things when the older original stuff becomes to basic, predictable, and eventually underpowered. Unfortunately at that point we can only continue to pressure what strengths the killers do get and avoid the survivors from exploiting the negatives. For GF, that would simply require being more tactical and stealthy when hunting, but the same cannot be said for other killers and I do understand what you're saying there. Thankfully the Devs have been approaching reworks openly, unlike -*cough*- Ubisoft.
---
Every time someone's says the words 7 seconds I Burts out laughing. That 7 seconds allows for an incredibly strong mind game even if a survivor is at a loop.
---
If a Gen is so close to being finished that they can power in under 7 seconds, it's basically already done even if you could stop them.
---
If someone is dumb enough to unhook in front of you that's 1 easy down and one person you know the location of so you can down them too.
---
I can understand how you don't realize Freddy's hidden power, so I'll forgive you, but don't even bother trying to convince me his power is useless. I'm not saying he's top tier or even mid tier, but he is fun and unique.
---
Lol someone just made a post saying Freddy is going to be weak
---
Survivors expected to be bailed out so I got free kills at the end since most killers are trash and didn't know how to counter flashlights.
---
Looks annoying. I find it funny they created the passive sleeping thing. It just looks out of place to me.
---
Except I‚Äôve been saying the same exact thing the whole time. They said similar things. You‚Äôre being very childish over absolutely nothing. Have a great day!
---
"Stillness Crows¬†are special Crows that will spawn above a Survivor's head, flying in circles, if that Survivor is staying in an area for too long without performing any interactions such as repairing a generator for example. This also applies to when a Survivor hides inside a¬†Locker¬†for too long, though the crows will then be perched atop the little roof."
---
People like you are why this community is shit. You have literally said you don‚Äôt read people‚Äôs comments that you know you disagree with. How the hell does being a bigot solve anything, or make you better than the rest of the community. Hint: It doesn‚Äôt.
---
love me some tru3talent!!!
---
Only thing I‚Äôm wondering about is since they are making loops shorter but adding more pallets can Freddy just spam those traps around the pallets so it‚Äôs impossible to loop
---
it's a common bug.
---
you always gotta hope you brought mori that round
---
Feels like game time is going to be dramatically extended.
---
"don't be salty"
---
"use your brain cells"
---
Speak for yourself
---
i dont read that kind of cooments that are too long saying stupid things.
---
Yip. You can get rid of them with flashlights too but do it from a distance because when you shine it you stand up.
---
Did anyone notice a release date? I watched most of the stream but must've missed this part if so.
---
Anyone play on ps4 and have a mic add me AngieWangie007
---
I'll bring that up on the PTB forums or whatever. That sounds like a cool idea to hide your sleep timer until you or someone else completely falls asleep. (Be it their timer running out or getting hit by Freddy which also instantly sleep you. Or if someone starts asleep from Freddy's addons.) 
---
Do note survivors might be able to find one of the dressers to wake up while awake, similar to spotting Bear Traps, Fountains, and Jigsaw Boxes against Trapper, Plague, and Pig. 
---
But you are right it does feel a bit weird to INSTANTANEOUSLY know it's Freddy as soon as the round starts. Doctor (Global zap noise/Madness tier up), Old Freddy (Sleeping indicator), Leatherface (Chainsaw), Billy (Chainsaw), Huntress (Charge up ting) Ghostface (Exposed meter) Pig (Jigsaw Boxes) Myers (Tier up theme) etc. all have global sounds or ways to tell you're against them but usually the killer has to do something like use their ability first. 
---
New Freddy gives his hand (You're playing against him) as soon as survivors spawn in which kills a tiny bit of the surprise factor. Would add a bit to the "Oh shit!" factor the very first time in a match when all four survivors suddenly fall asleep at the exact same time.
---
Your supposed to get 4 man escapes at red ranks? I'm pretty sure at least 2 survivors are supposed to die more if the killer is very good. Playing solo is way more fun because everyone is trying to get out and anything can happen. Of course some teammates will intentionally not save you or farm you sometimes but that's just how it is. Expecting to survive the trial is where your going wrong. It should be a pleasant surprise if you do survive. Killers have it way harder to rank up and survivors is easy. Most of the time I just die on purpose when everyone else gets out to alleviate myself of the boredom. Of course this is how I see it.

And everyone else with a copy of the game is entitled to call them out as a shitty teammate, and do whatever they want. Also the facecamping killer is still trying to participate/win, so I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre much more tolerable than the survivor teammate that quits the second they aren‚Äôt dominating the killer.
---
no i speak to you and you will make the most of it to not be a prick anymore.
---
1. It has been confirmed that hit survivors will be put to sleep.
---
2. The Gen teleport has a 45 second cooldown that is reduced for each survivor in the dream state.
---
I'VE NEVER BEEN PART OF ANYTHING  :::SNIFF::: WARMS MY HEART...
---
Hello there br√∏ther
---
No one forgot. Freddy was being bitched about the most, so they dealt with him first.
---
Agreed.
---
Wait, are you using an Android and can you please give a step-by-step on how to do this?
---
Yeah let me gimp myself by not using the snares, pallets, or teleport. Good idea. Just because you can play no-blink nurse doesn't mean it's the correct way to play her. I'm saying I like killers who *only* have M1 in chases.
---
I was confused on this too. He's in a good spot.
---
20 second sprint burst
---
Sprint burst and balanced not sharing cooldown.
---
Insta complete BNP
---
Insta mori
---
Insta blind
---

---
Got it, thanks for the clarification.
---
Again hitting survivors  puts them to sleep
---
Interesting look on it. Definitely will tweak my loadout a bit then.
---
Disappointed, he doesn‚Äôt seem unique anymore, now he‚Äôs just a hybrid.
---
everyone should play both sides. i say that a lot!
---
corn field
---
If they do gens for those 20 seconds and fail a skill check, that's 20 seconds for 2% progress. And that's if they get skill checks often. If they sleep for 40 seconds and then get a skill check, that's half a gens time for 12%. Horribly ineffecient. They can heal for 20 seconds, they took longer to heal than Sloppy Butcher for only half progress. Plus he can apply it infinitely.
---
The dream transition can be used for a mindgame and a free hit. Being asleep also makes it harder to see Freddy, and his short height grant him more mid chase mindgames than most killers except Spirit.
---
I strictly stick by a max 2 on the one gen unless it's the last gen. It's never a good idea to group up for a number of reasons.
---
And what about when there's not even heartbeat when the killer is chasing you?
---
she's so excited her whole damn jaw is about to fly off her face lmao.
---
Dude he‚Äôs new leave him alone.
---
It's not that Freddy makes things take awhile that's the bad part. The problem with Freddy is that he makes things take forever including his downs. If there was actual tension with the slow matches it would be fun but as it stands the match just takes way too long.
---
So? Sleep doesn't do jack squat.
---
Basically.
---
I like to use it for Trapper spooks when the gates are open, I trap a gate and then hide with Insidious, once I hear the sound of them starting to disarm it I rocket out and smack them. Sometimes results in the remaining survivors escaping, but its worth it when I scare the shit out of the occasional guy going for the exit gate points.
---
For me GF never works, survivors always see me before I can even stalk for a second. I know that's probably my fault, but it's still dumb to give the other side so much power over what you can do.
---
I felt the same with the prestiging. I honestly suck at playing Bubba.
---
DON'T FUCKING LIE TO ME!
---
This was LIVE on TWITCH and I called him out on it. I can't stand him.
---
it was the same with the legion changes back in april
---
There wasant anything unique about him before, he was an M1 killer with an additional step
---
‚ÄúSaying stupid things.‚Äù Why are other human beings‚Äô opinions ‚Äústupid‚Äù to you? You come off as very haughty; as if your opinions are superior to others.
---
"not be a prick anymore"
---
Damn I really am the salty one aren't I
---
&gt;makes a valid point
---
&gt;downvoted
---
Funny how killers are expected to play nice but survivors arent
---
Im a survivor main btw
---
Some people are so ungrateful to be a viable killer, but not you... not anymore.
---
Lmao just trying to enjoy it the same way you were. ‚ÄòKeep going because I‚Äôm having fun with this.‚Äô Love how fast your attitude switches when you can‚Äôt say shit back. Have a day!
---
Lol!  Classic move on this sub.  When someone that says something that clashes with your narrative being pushed simply accuse them of lying.  Dude it was a ballpark estimation but an accurate one.  I've been playing for 2 years and I've been rank 1 over a dozen times dating all the way back to pallet vacuum, instablinds, recovering exhaustion midchase, wraith uncloaking to kick gens etc....some months I don't play as much.  The fact that you are astonished that it is possible to play fair at red ranks speaks volumes about the weakness in your killer play.  Watch the leading streamers man.  You'll learn some mindgames and strategies that will free you up from having to proxy and babytunnel down survivors.
---
The teleport has some solid mind game potential since it can be canceled, I‚Äôm also predicting good synergy with thrilling tremors and/or BBQ
---
They already make you pay 10 for high rairty cosmetics and again they also get income from the sale of the game and all the dlc
---
So what‚Äôs the point of being asleep anymore? And what‚Äôs the point of waking up?
---
Which is what I want, personally. There aren't any other killers that can guarantee 32k point games because the survivors finish every generator in 4 minutes.
---
1. but do u not realize that with wraith, u can do better?
---
2. no always
---
3. and what if they are on the exit gates door? 
---
4. whats his hidden power? ur not a killer that can map control very good, 
---
do u realize that freddy is the only killer that cant do shit in the chase, shitty map control, and literally the only viable way to play as sharp hand joe is with addons.
---
now... explain me the "hidden" power of freddy
---
it's the same thing. running away to hide or slowly walking away to hide... they all do it the millisecond they hear something that even resembles a heartbeat. At least sprintburst will leave marks or give the option for a chase to start which is a lot more fun spending 15 mins looking for immersive players
---
because u say im bad, add me and lets see how bad i am;)
---
BHVR removes Billy flick
---
mentions possibility of bringing it back in the future as an addon or some other way
---
this is not the future I was promised
---
No, you didn't have to at all.
---
Freddy can have 8 traps at the same time, but they are infinite like hag traps.
---
Also maybe add the fake pallets?
---
u have 2 weeks to play the old one tho, i cant say anything about ur preference...
---
any idea when the next chapter release is going to be then?
---
Sooo whats the point of sleeping survivors now?
---
Bruh tell me this isn‚Äôt a lie.
---
tf are you talking about? why would it make pallets go away?  if you make a survivor loop around a fake pallet they will just animation lock themselves for a hit I never said anything about making real ones go away
---
July 9th, next Tuesday.
---
Sigh, I'm just being nostalgic bro chill. I'm am totally in favor of the changes.
---
Legion &gt; Nurse. Change my mind ;).
---
Yeah that shit pissess me offff so much
---
To use your powers.
---
Yeah, we forgot, they only detailed his entire power and his absolute lack of anything that gets a survivor off a gen. Sorry, we should wait til next week to point out that he has a bunch of fancy effects that amounts to almost nothing of value in a match.
---
teleporting to gens= useless? hmmm... Are u okay?
---
slowing survivors on loop= useless...
---
literally midngaming survivors with fake pallets= useless
---
are u joking right?
---
Dream Snares and Dream Pallets only work on sleeping survivors.
---
July 9th for the PTB. Live release will most likely be two weeks after that. So the 23rd.
---
ty so much \^\^
---
Typically I just look near my feet and i find the claudette.
---
Freddy's snares and fake pallets are ineffective against awake survivors. He can only utilize the gen teleportation against them. Sleeping makes you vulnerable to his true powers.
---
They already did it to Wraith and Trapper tho. Heck, Trapper's QoL came with Hag's.
---
PTB is on Tuseday after will probably depend on the PTB reception
---
There's somethin wrong with the matchmaking takes me no joke like 15 mins find a game as survivor which is strange
---
lmao thats okay bro, ik he can be fun sometimes, but very weak
---
No. He‚Äôs not gonna get any downvotes. This place is majority bitchy killer mains, and they all agree with this guy because the ones who tho k Freddy is OP are the survivor mains. It‚Äôs like when DS was getting nerfed, no one on here was  against it because everyone here sides with the killers.
---
When survivors are asleep they can get caught on the dream snares. And for every one survivor asleep, Freddy's cool down for teleporting to a generator is reduced by 15%
---
It doesn't? I usually die and make 3-10k less BP than everyone else. I figured kindred would at least help someone.
---
I‚Äôm a simple man, I see a gravity falls meme,  I upvote
---
They just made legion stupid imo, legion was already stupid but the fact that your next second feral hit on the the survivor you originally hit does not stack is just absurd. They shouldve just made it stack twice but legion gets stunned. Because lets face face it deep wounds are easily mendable and dont get triggered while in a chase. So legion is just bad, the feral frenzy is just for map control and just chasing.
---
God this gif is incredible
---
That‚Äôs funny how people likes diff√©rents thing. When I play surv, i don‚Äôt care about dying or not, i just try to play the best I can, and help the team as much as I can, even if sometimes it means my death.  I obviously like the adrenaline of escaping, and am a bit pissed when I did a good game and die so close to the end (unless it is because I saved a teammate at endgame, especially if the killer had noed).
---
If you can, try to enjoy the game that way, it‚Äôs amazing and relaxing.
---
The gen teleport always works, but the cooldown is reduced for each sleeping survivor.
---
But why yes?
---
+250 survivor found
---
No lie, 100% official game.
---
*fbi open up!*
---
As others have said, the dream snare and pallet only works on sleeping survivors, his teleport cooldown is reduced for each sleeping survivor, and you can utilize the terror radius instead of the lullaby.
---
How does a rank 20 get better when facing the worst killers who most of the time camp and tunnel
---
That too
---
I honestly don't know why nobody likes the new Freddy changes. I think his powers/abilities are pretty neat with his gen teleportation ability a gen protector build would be cool. I haven't played Freddy because of his ability same goes for Legion but with the new changes for Freddy I might actually buy him.
---
Yeah. You said this already.
---
Its a 15% slow also. Inside the trap and for 3 seconds after leaving it.
---
guess you can never please everyone I love his rework lol
---
Pro gamers
---
I told you I do literally nothing to sabotage my survival early on, I‚Äôm just that unlucky sometimes dude. I couldn‚Äôt tell how to deal with a killer that early in
---
What killer are they? What strategy do I use agaisnt that killer? What do I do as the current survivor that I am? What do I do in this environment that has no lockers or pallets? What do I do when there is no wall between his vision and me? Sums up every early game where I instant hook.
---
Thanks for answering my questions! There were also some cool things that I definitely didn't know, like the Nurse change. As a Trapper, I kept walking over my own traps, too.
---
&gt; when a survivor runs close to a wall, it seems like they are running into the wall‚Äî but this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they are being slowed down. In fact, the most efficient movement looks like this. 
---
Could you clarify? Why is this kind of movement efficient?
---
I just took ruin off GF in place for insidious, thank you for your input
---
True don't get me wrong, I'd buy anything for her. It just seems bizarre that a cosmetic is worth more than a new killer, survivor, and map lol.
---
I have, it only pisses me off.
---
I‚Äôm proud for you too!
---
Well issue with that the pallet illusion is useless on infinites while the snares can slow down the infinite immensely
---
Its every 3 Months so I'm gonna assume within the next 2 Months
---
Yeah it definitely does. I played a lot of FPS games before this, some had you having to melee moving targets that sometimes try to sneak past you, so I kind of felt at home with people trying to pass me by.
---
My issue is losing survivors on the cornfield. I always lose them there.
---
Strange. It usually take 10 to 5 for me when I play killer but only 5 if I play survivor.
---
How'd you get in the beta?
---
I know! Big F for you mate.
---
Because i can
---
Got to admit it's one of the better cosmetics so paying more for one of the best seems fair to me. But that's just me.
---
Use range and dress addons to get more people in dream and keep them there for longer. Switch targets constantly, dont chase people if they are heading into a broken structure (e.g myers house infinite), prioritise sleeping over anything else.
---
Fair enough.
---
I would add, while you're awake you hear his heartbeat as normal. but when you're asleep, his heartbeat is replaced by the lullaby, which as of the recent change is non-directional.
---
There are a lot of bitter people who don't even play the game anymore but remain to give smug "advice" and shit all over any positive feeling someone may have about the game.  The game isn't perfect and the Devs do need criticism and feedback to grow, but there is a culture of people who have no interest in playing anymore and just want to stir up shit for no good reason.
---
Leaving after one hook is toxic. You‚Äôre the one defending toxicity here.
---
The hypocrisy in your comment is making me laugh
---
Clown is a bit slowed down, but his bottles travel certain distance. Range is a huge thing, there is a reason why huntress with ranged attack has slower movement speed than most other killers.
---
Freddy places traps near him. And unlike Freddy, Clown's bottles can be used whenever he decides to reload them, Freddy's traps work after 60 seconds, or during long chase (after you hit them for the first time).
---
I feel ya.  I got 3 face camping bubbas in a row today.  One even did the classic insidious basement camp build.  
---
But it's okay I ranked up 4 times today, you just gotta keep playing!
---
Show me where I call his opinions stupid or say I won‚Äôt read them because I disagree with them? Have you not read every comment on this post? He has openly admitted to not reading other people‚Äôs comment because he disagrees with them, stating they‚Äôre  ‚Äústupid.‚Äù It‚Äôs funny because I actually agree with his opinion on Legion. I just disagree with him calling other people stupid/refusing to acknowledge their opinions for disagreeing with him.
---
I wish I couldn't relate to this but unfortunately I can.
---
That is so tremendously bad, wow.
---
The entity realized that particular ghostface was no ordinary ghostface and can destroy the exit gates. He decided to intervene to save you from certain death. Cheers to the entity!
---
Theyre changing him entirely because survivors hated the old freddy too
---
Exactly.
---
Also to note, it has a long cooldown (~45s) and starts the trial on cooldown.  The cooldown is decreased by 15% for each sleeping survivor.
---
Those killers are the worst. But he has no clue how to counter pallet looping. He waited waaaaay to long to break those pallets.
---
I feel like it's way too easy to wake up. They shouldnt have allowed failed skillchecks to still work. I guess we'll have to see how easy it is to fall asleep
---
*See, shit, grass long*
---
Butt where is 69?
---
Kindred is one of those perks that feels like a waste of a slot, but I absolutely love it when my team runs it
---
It seems to work well enough for Michael
---
Baffling concept: the community is not just one person.
---
Now the actually broken mechanic (if it werent on freddy it would be a problem) is furtive chase on fredward, 100% aura reading on sleeping survivors with red brush.
---
Honestly, I don't blame you for this process bc this is kind of what I do. Personally, I deliberately try NOT to tunnel; because injuring everyone once is still better than only injuring ONE person in regards to the points you gain at the end of the game (chase, brutality, and I forget the other 2 on killer).
---
That's why tunneling is regarded as being bad usually, between my friends and I. You're not only shorting yourself on points, but also the survivors short themselves a lot of the time on their other tasks when they farm for altruism by being dumb with their hooksaves. Farming altruism is equivocal to tunneling, to me.
---
I believe it's a two way street, in the end. : o
---
the only people who ever wanted a freddy buff were the people who didn't fucking know how to play freddy optimally. freddy is legit worse after the rework but nobody thinks he is because "7 second fedora man bad"
---
Sloppy as well, since people can't wake you up if you're injured
---
Oh boy, douchebag fight!
---
*grabs popcorn*
---
This. It's far too complicated, has too many parts to it, and has far too many ways to wake up. Other killers are simpler. This Freddy has *three different things he can do*, one of which becomes more and more useless as the match goes on, there are less generators on the map, and survivors start to die.
---
It's two different groups of people.  People who don't enjoy current Freddy but want a killer with the whole dream world thematic call for a rework.  When the rework is announced, the people who were silent before because they enjoyed Freddy come out and complain.  The community isn't one singular hypocritical entity with a single opinion.  Those who wanted a rework spoke up before, and the ones that didn't are speaking up now.
---
I do those tricks. They never work mate. For fucks sake I always play conservative, never works out. It is seriously entirely luck, man. No matter what the fuck I do, regardless of how I play, if the match starts and the killer comes my way already, I‚Äôm fucked. **Nothing. Works** I‚Äôve tried everything. Im rank 13.
---
It's finally happening boys  
---
So who's gonna fill this old boys shoes of being worst?
---
I think it's too easy to wake up (skillchecks, other players, and those alarm clocks). I'd get rid of the alarm clocks because them being a quick way to wake up in two seconds PLUS keeping you awake for another 30s is too strong and pig-like.
---
Yes, it most certainly was unique. And no other killer has the tracking or the built-in stall Freddy has, not by a long shot.
---
If the bloodweb offered loot crates and the store sold $.99 keys, then the game would make a lot more money.
---
Wait no don't read this devs, forget you saw anything.
---
A freddy who has played freddy and plays his ability well doesn't suffer from any of these (horrible dream world vision? Hold out your power ability, when someones sleeping they're blue and really obvious to you and your ability auto locks onto awake survivors. The only one with impaired vision is them)
---
Each Chapter DLC is $7 and DbD is $30. But you can buy all non-licenced DLC with Iridescent Shards and DbD is almost always on sale.
---
The only stable income BHVR get from DbD is when they release cosmetics. Not to mention that the majority of cosmetics for a character can be bought with Iridescent Shards.
---
If you are really complaining about potentially needing to buy an outfit you really want, than you're just being petty. I'm sorry, I don't mind spending $10 on rare occasions to buy an outfit I really want.
---
click on first link from description for download links :)
---
Makes me glad I play both because for my friends I play with that only play survivors, I get to teach them things about killers they don't look up themselves. (Like freddy being able to see people in dream realm while out of terror range)
---
Yep I checked its ad cancer I'm not using that
---
On rank reset when i dont want to stomp low rank survivors i use it as an opportunity for build diversity, i use insidious but i either predict or us bbq and pick a choke point where i can observe "route b" while i sit at route a and it often pays off where the savior walks right on top of me, i love it.
---
Also if you have a gen suppresion build its good too by coming to a gen thats over 50% and m1'ing someone off it, then stomp gen and 180¬∞ and hide with insid, they always race back to tap it to stop regression, thats when you get em an a chase possibly lasted 30 seconds optimally.
---
They get rid of old Legion because it was a complete BS who make almost everyone to instantly DC and now you want them to bring old Legion back ?
---
No, just no.
---
Good artists are inspired. Great artists steal. Or something like that. I don't really find the fact that Freddy can teleport to gens but because some chinese game did that too.
---
And his traps are different, unless Hag is also a rip-off of trapper. Scratch that, every killer is a rip-off of trapper, they can all hit survivors. Also, I think his alarm clock stands seem more similar to Pig's Jacksaw Boxes than Plague's Shrines.
---
I feel like Freddy will be in a better place than he is *now*. There is a reason why he is on the bottom of pretty much every tier list.
---
My best friends boyfriend just started a metal band and I'm just hONKING WITH LAUGHTER LMfAo what an appropriate time to see this üòÇ
---
Neat, good thing I don‚Äôt care about bloodpoints!
---
Lol then all is well! I wish you good hunts :&gt;
---
Playing the game how you want is fine, calling people isn't.
---
Survivor found
---
Wut, really?
---
u/numb4lyfe
---
Yeah I mean some killers are more subtle like hey there's a trap or hex there but this one just goes "yeah your facing Freddy"
---
?
---
This post game chat was probably interesting
---
*Second pic
---
But hitting them instantly sleeps them. I can see Freddy will be ironically very good at anti loop (When before Freddy was helpless in an actual chase besides an easy first hit out of sleep transition) considering you can "seamlessly" (Compared to Hag and Trapper) place the traps in the middle of a chase.
---
Its almost like people have varying opinions and Reddit isn't just one hivemind with the same opinion.
---
It decreases your cool-down and makes it so survivors are likely to fall for a trap mid chase
---
I‚Äôd start off as a killer so you know how the visuals work (first person over third)  and your not scared out of your mind this game was scary for me in the beginning. Once you get a handle on killer surviving should be fun
---
lol no it's not
---
Rank
---
IMO this is what dbd needs, killer add ons to drastically change their power, hags add ons are interesting where some remove teleport but body block and some dont give a notification, trappers new add ons are fun where disarming can wound you or some traps dont wound you at all, but best add ons are wraiths where they are so different, 1 males it so the break action takes you out of cloaked instantly, 1 makes actions in cloaked faster, 1 makes red stain and terror radius suppressed for 6 seconds after uncloaking.
---
Thsen we have hillbilly which is speed up chainsaw charge, speed up chainsaw speed, speed up chainsaw cooldown, make turning better, reduce stun, theyre boring. Add some weird shit in like billy having passive phasing like spirit when chainsawing or the longer the chainsaw sprint the better the turning is etc, mix it up.
---
20$, i used to play League and i had all the definitive skins and a lot of legendaries and others so you can tell i love spending on games, honestly dbd is very cheap considering how hard it has to be to make the 3d model.
---
Ah the great enjoyment this has brought to the sub has been almost as fulfilling as getting a 4k against a really damn good squad of survivors
---
**EVERYONE KNOWS THIS GAMES COMMUNITY IS KILLER SIDED THOUGH!!!!!** /s
---
I love it so much &lt;3
---
It's actually a bit more than twice...
---
Ok that's shilling way too much , I can't imagine paying 20$ for a skin on dead by daylight or any game where I can't re sell the item. 
---
Sure making a model is hard but that item value compounds when it can be sold a infinite amount of times.
---
No Hag‚Äôs traps are for teleporting unless use the add on for BP that removed the teleport. And all the things I mentioned as being rip offs are infact rip offs. 
---
Great artists create. Nothing wrong with inspiration. But thieves and lazy people steal. This rework is a mess, over complicated and just a copy paste hybrid. Why does everyone agree that Ghostface is the Meyers and Pig rip off and hownthat was dumb but no one can seem to see what they are doing with Freddy. They stole mechanics from another game and didn‚Äôt even try to change it at all aside from visual differences, and the ripped mechanics of several other killers in their own game as well. 
---
That isn‚Äôt a rework, it‚Äôs a shit show. It is blatantly obvious that they were tired of everyone screaming for the rework that he DIDNT REALLY NEED, so they just threw something together to shut everyone up. Just like Legion‚Äôs original power was thrown together and not really looked at, just like Ghostface was thrown together. They don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and don‚Äôt care to. 
---
No other killer is this complicated and every other killer at least has some semblance of control over their primary power. The automatic dream transition completely removed the power from his hands. If it bugs or doesn‚Äôt work just right, all of the others powers become obsolete. The alarm clocks are a decent idea, but now also give survivors even more of a chance to wake up. A safer way sure, but that is going to make it‚Äôs so much harder for him. Instead of failing a generator, regressing it, and alerting him that someone is on that Gen and to kick it and regress it more, I would rather use the alarm clock. For healing I‚Äôd rather still use the alarm clock. People forcing themselves awake in current state is one of his main forms or tracking and hunting right now. The alarm clocks potentially remove that ability which is stupid.
---
It also doesn‚Äôt make sense. Lore wise the only way to wake yourself up was with something drastic. When you‚Äôre too far into your dreams, alarm clocks didn‚Äôt help you. Nancy literally has to physically hem yourself to wake up at one point. That‚Äôs why the current way of waking up makes sense. Against a Freddy the second strongest ability he has is to force all survivors to prioritize waking up and healing. Alarm clocks ruin that potential. At the least they should have either a cool down, or only work a limited number of times. 
---
There is no good side to rework Freddy. For survivors when it works right, it will be absolute HELL. I predict a huge increase in DC‚Äôs. And then with how potentially inconsistent it looks, it will be equally hell for the killer themselves. 
---
Again. This rework is a joke, a slap in the face, and so unneeded and unimportant right now. FIX GAME HEALTH. Then break characters.
---
Failing a skill check wakes you up as can other survivors. Alarm clock auras are not shown to Freddy I believe. (Devs said they tried it and it didn't work out on the stream because Freddy would camp the clocks)
---
Certainly appears so
---
being looped is your own fault most of the time lmao break the chase
---
Huntress mains like Scott Jund or Umbra said that Huntress should have 115% speed, because some maps literally rape her right now, so maybe the range isn't as big as you think it is.
---
C'mon, you don't need to chase survivors for so long to get a first hit.
---
New Freddy will be better than Clown, just because Clown has over 40 bugs at the moment. And also Freddy has better map control and better perk synergy than Clown.
---
‚ÄúRealistically‚Äù your not gunna be tripping and falling as much as they tend to. Or get knocked back 3 feet from a kick.  The most struggling tends to be the death throes and the murderer trying to keep the victim from flailing so much. 
---
Especially if it was as premeditated as the killings are made out to be      The first movie being kids I can understand.   More so with stu    
---
real life cases premeditated murder tends to have signs of struggle in a single area than throughout a entire 2 story house        Whether its a kill and flee type or a stalk and opportunistic type
---
I mean the actual killings it was based on was mostly just one room where everything happened
---
Last time I checked I could've swore it was 10$ in cells, maybe I was off?
---
God I hope so
---
holy heck that's a mouthful
---
Yeah, but you will be playing the game anyway. It's supposed to be this way, if they would be easy to get, then there would be no point in making them purchasable with real money.
---
None of those. Those only have it for a few seconds or within a certain range. Freddy had map-wide aura-reading that lasted for as long as the survivor was asleep and outside of his terror radius.
---
survivor mains be like: "just dont get looped, break off the chase 4head"
---
I‚Äôd love it for Freddy. The current Freddy is just harder to play successfully. Everyone just goes ‚Äúlul 7 seconds‚Äù. 
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be good for Legion because you‚Äôd get Frank‚Äôs Mixtape and Stab Wounds Study/Cold Dirt Legions who moonwalk.
---
It's been that kind of day. They go in waves.
---
Blaze it.
---
Not 100% sure, but aren't all wraith outfits buyable with shards?
---
Wouldn't be suprising, he is kinda low tier.
---
Me too. I'm going to miss survivors being dumb as hell and squatting behind a wall out in the open like I can't see them, lmao. Even better are those who are trying to get into a locker when I'm nearby, like I can't see that either lol.
---
you shouldn't need to bring an add-on for a killer to be viable imo
---
Spirit is 115
---
How dare you suggest this
---
Man, you really got me there with the middle school insults (also congrats on dipping into the green ranks too! I bet you‚Äôre proud of making it that far!)
---
You seem to have some trouble focusing on what we were talking about though, so I‚Äôll help out a little. You were defending people that quit early or just act like selfish teammates in general because ‚ÄúTh3y B0uGht tHe gAmE!‚Äù and they should be protected from all complaints from teammates. If you can‚Äôt handle your teammates bitching at you for quitting early, then stop crying.
---
He sounds as complicated as the doctor now... perhaps more complicated. I don't like complicated.
---
Pretty sure Killers are 500 cells, while skins are 1080. It's not much, but a *bit* more.
---
&gt;literally the same happened with the legion...
---
That's because the legion changes were rushed and awful?
---
Why is everyone so happy to lodge their lips in the devs' asscracks after the last 3 killers we've got have had powers completely in the survivors' control.
---
If you can't draw conclusions from seeing his entire power, his incredibly slow start to the match, 0 debuff on what is meant to be a debuff, and 45 second cooldown on a majorly telegraphed teleport, I'm worried for you.
---
But hey, with 0 negative feedback he'll magically get better by getting put on the PTB. Enjoy 5 gens going off while you wait for people to fall asleep only to realise they aren't wasting their time waking up because there's almost no reason to wake up.
---
I find Plague really fun even though she is low on the tier list. If you want something strong you can try The Spirit or Michael Myers.
---
The killer is being looped because the can't cut the chase
---
I'd say spirit is a good grab
---
Yeah, I don't like how complicated he seems to be now
---
Works fine. Seems poorly optimized though as it's really laggy on my iPad Pro. Should be better on my iPhone 8 Plus but haven't been able to get into a round on my phone yet.
---
I mean, I do fine as Wraith in red ranks. Only times I struggle are bullshit maps or when like 4 long wall jungle gyms are pressed around pig tree, with ironworks or cowshed window in spitting distance
---
They should have just done an anti-tunnel mechanic thing or something, but no, all of us have to suffer.
---
Yes all of them. Every killer had better stall and tracking then Freddy.
---
Isn't that first perk just a worse version of Kate's perk?
---
Ohh, yeah, such a big boon. Except the traps can be deactivated whenever and for them to ever be asleep during a chase you have to win another chase without traps first. Great.
---
Reverse beartraps automatically activate if you try to escape with them still attached, correct?
---
I never said I quit early and I also never said I was good at the game either.
---
Survivors mains be like : "just play Nurse or Spirit to not be looped 4head" and then "OMG Nurse and Spirit are so OP, devs, nerf them please".
---
I honestly think that's okay. People can enjoy the character for less, which allows more people to buy it. Cosmetics are a "luxury" item that people can choose to buy to further support the devs and future content.
---
Could have fooled me
---
Yeah... no, it was Frank's Mixtape, old Legion was garbage at high ranks and thats why I said it on my OP.
---
Everyone says its bad but I see all the top players and streamers running it when I tune in, why's that? I get its slower but people seem to not care.
---
He's still invisible, right? Can he now hit you before he pulls you into the dream world or does that stay the same?
---
Just use Iron Will.
---
Almost every Myers I play against is playing from a tacobell on the rings of saturn or something. I don‚Äôt know why but its almost always myers when playing against someone super laggy
---
Oh yeah? Well me and my toxic survive with friends just went up against a top 10 ranked killer in NA, who was actually hacking. We wound up completing all the gens in 4.25 seconds and escaped, and spent the next 3 hours tbagging at the gate! Best part is we didn't even run any perks (because we're toxic). Aren't we good at the game?? Gg ez baby fahad0595
---
I'm not too good with Killer to begin with and I mainly play killer for Dailies or if I really need to get some points since it's easier to get BPs with killer. Only killer I can really play right now is Doctor, and then I can kind of do a decent job with Legion. Past that I cannot play killer to save my life, I need to play them more so I'm not just doing Survivor games, but the ranking system keeps me from wanting to (I'm rank 14 and I get like, rank 7 swfs, thanks bhvr.)
---
I made the same mistake the first time I went against the Pig. XD
---
You fall asleep in 60 sec/ after you get hit. Also waking up get progressively harder as the game goes on. Waking someone else up requires both people to be healthy, and takes longer over time. You get 1 alarm clock assigned to you all game and even then you still only get 30 sec more of no sleep, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter because he can just smack you and keep you asleep.
---
Then I replace a crutch perk with another crutch perk? I feel like the pros and cons of both are equivalent.
---
I really hope they are just placeholder changes until they can fully rework legion. Legion is in such a terrible position right now. Not fun to play as or against imo.
---
No clue they probably forgot to mention it in the stream. It was officially said on the forums though so it‚Äôs not getting removed as of now.
---
No, but all you have to do to see that rework freddy is bad is look at his stats.
---
Well, now THAT's in character.
---
yes in the Dream world
---
Fair enough
---
Do you like chasing or stalking?
---
Do you want a killer that is mediocre at best or one that might actually be viable? 
---
Do you want to sound mad or dissapointed when getting stunned?
---
Now with the questions out of the way. 
---
Ignore the questions and get Legion.
---
Dont count your chickens lol, he will probably just get nerfed afterwards
---
Old Frank's Mixtape was a mistake, let just say old Legion without Frank' mixtape.
---
Doctor says hello
---
my god, the number of ppl complaining about it would be big lol. I think this is over the top
---
It‚Äôs a Hag teleport with a bigger delay before he appears based on what saw during the livestream.
---
Get licensed chapters because you can only unlock those with real money. Everything else is unlockable in-game with iridescence shards. I recommend The Halloween Chapter and the Nightmare on Elm Street chapter. Michael Myers is a lot of fun to play and Freddy‚Äôs rework is coming out soon so having him prepared for that will give you a nice advantage once the update rolls out.
---
yeah, when i get 360d during my FF, it makes me wanna pull my ethernet cord.
---
He never was OP, just very annoying to verse, people or DCed or gen rushed him, so the matches against him could've end quickly. But you  also said that they could change to their old add-ons, so they could use again old Frank's Mix Tape.
---
Ah, I was never clear if ONLY the landmarks were consistent, or if the maps had set topography and item placement was all that changed.
---
But yeah, it would take an expansion to fit everything, although ideally kept as tight as possible.
---
Praise the feng
---
O h  n o  redditor is gonna downvote something he doesn't like
---
Have you ever thought that two different people can have two different opinions? Or is everyone saying these things in unison?
---
Is it really that much better to just say ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing I could possibly do. I‚Äôm just going to keep losing the same way‚Äù? That seems pretty bleak to me, and it offers no incentive to improve. 
---
You‚Äôre obviously not saying you‚Äôre perfect at the game, so there‚Äôs absolutely something you can change up. If that sounds like bullshit to you, then I guess you‚Äôre right, and you‚Äôre already as good as you‚Äôll ever be.
---
it's not about being subbed or not.. it's about hearing his incessent bitching about not getting enough donations coming in and raging.  Dunno how you think that is enjoyable.
---
From what I saw he can hit you regardless of dream world or not, and he becomes visible when he‚Äôs close, flickers at mid range then is invisible past that.
---
*Killer leaves after 1 second to avoid post game roasts*
---
You are a master of deflection, straw-men arguments, and generally being in denial. I am obviously not talking about the bright noticeable cosmetics as I specified the dark colored cosmetics, but if reading comprehension is not your strong suit then that is alright. This is your second chance to catch up on the argument. 
---
The fact that I am urging other consumers not to support the prices of these skins does not make me ‚Äúentitled‚Äù or a ‚Äúpreteen‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know how this would make me either of those things in your mind, but I‚Äôm not too worried with following your logic since it‚Äôs flimsy at best.
---
A mix of both.... Developerd need to fix this...
---
I personally just don't want to feel like I *have* to play Nurse or Spirit to have a chance against competent survivors. But that's sadly the case since those are the only killers that can make plays against efficient survivors that don't fuck up regularly. Every other killer thrives on mistakes.
---
Sure there are offenders on both sides. But the same people I see complaining about "only facing Billy/Nurse in the high ranks" also screech whenever a new killer seems strong. They screeched when Clown was released, they screeched Legion into an early grave, they screeched when Plague was released, and they're still screeching about Ghost Face. This premature complaining about rework Freddy feels oddly reminiscent of what got him dunked into the F tier to begin with.
---
To be fair, there were a lot of kids there. I'd still guess wrong when watching if I had just this information.
---
I dunno, something consistent? Something that doesn't rely on minute long timers and cooldowns and M1ing to do anything? Something good. "Crazy map pressure" lmao. Teleporting to a single generator with a five second warning and a 45 second cooldown isn't any pressure.
---
Doctor man bad
---
oh he failed that lunge terribly.
---
They prpbably forgot because they were to busy answering the same 4 questions multiple times
---
That's pretty much it. The general trend of DbD has always been that Killers follow Survivors and wait for mistakes. Nurse, Huntress, and Billy subvert that by adding potential counters, and Trapper can at least limit Survivor options to reduce their running time (in the right area, given how few traps he's allowed vs. the map sizes).
---
But, the ideal is that, if there were a situation in which a Killer with default everything and no special or perks were chasing a Survivor with the same nothing, the chase would STILL have depth.
---
Thank you 
---
I will T-Bag with you and that is all. Have a good day.
---
I just want to see more stylish survivors. Some of these people have no fashion sense
---
Did I do something to you?
---
Swf my guy
---
Spirit is 110 bud.
---
Lol rekt
---
They mean that bond shows up a lot in shrine and so does overcharge so they're counterparts for each side.
---
The Hag has addons that just change gameplay as well (body blocking clones)
---
Oh no what happened to feng! She is looking a little different then usual
---
Legions already there my dude.
---
Meth :,(
---
&gt;playing legion and even remotely leaving your 4K up to chance
---
Absolute idiot
---
You know you can still force people to sleep right? Hittin them puts htem to sleep.
---
It for sure makes you both if you're THIS upset over a cosmetic choice that has zero impact on the game. Nothing will convince me you're older than 15. Go on, little boy. Complain somewhere else.
---
Brown grass
---
Scroll down and use MediaFire Download Links, no ad cancer but they get removed fast.
---
Luckily they are working on matchmaking right now. In the roadmap it says they will until the next chapter. That's what it shows on the roadmap but they might work on it longer.
---
I can hear an uninjured Jeff on opposite sides of the game map sometimes. I know hes out of shape, but come on lol
---
Mind explaining what makes him an addon-dependent killer instead of just saying that he is?
---
Lol yeah, they do get a bit nervous and stressed on streams though. Like remember the plague stream they forgot to mention what being fully sick actually did
---
Aghhh-HHNN-Nyeehh-AGHHHH-Hyaaa-Nyeehh-h-AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!  Is still a thing
---
XD he too thicccccc
---
&gt;I personally just don't want to feel like I have to play Nurse or Spirit to have a chance against competent survivors. But that's sadly the case since those are the only killers that can make plays against efficient survivors that don't fuck up regularly.
---
(Idk if I'm doing the quote correctly so sorry if its wrong)
---
Idk if I maybe worded my opinion wrong - but I would love to play against something that is good at high ranks. The only point I'm trying to get across is that I'm tired of seeing threads that say "Survivors screeching nerfs again" when there only seem to be a few instance, because it's not all survivors that are complaining. It's a select few people who want an ezpz win that they can gloat to the killer in post chat with. Those same types of people also exist on killer side, but naturally it's not "every single killer"
---
I haven't been on the subreddit *all day* so maybe I missed a bit of nerf screeching, which if I did then I appologize.
---
Like I said in an earlier comment though, the first comment was only a joke, albiet one of poor taste.
---
We *love* a stacked Daddy
---
Implying that Legion is better than Ghostface lul
---
Had someone dc after I ‚Äústunned‚Äù the killer and he just walked on like nothing happened
---
Pharmacy over self care? stfu
---
But it's bad until tier 3, and I definitely haven't gotten that either. It's a crutch if you're replacing a crutch with it and saying to always run it, imo anyway... feel free to do you dawg.
---
We sure do Buddy
---
Then they're like GG BaBy kIlLeR! GeT bEtTerR aT tHe gAMe lol. 
---
How am I meant to get better at the game if you keep bitching about things that aren't neccessary
---
Amen brother lol.
---
I mean, that's people who are either bad, or new so idk what you expect.
---
Self care can be great depending on your build.  So, uh, I would let the two posters bitching about it tell you how to play.  
---
Either way - I feel you.  I‚Äôm ok now (T3 Kate) but during my T2 I never got it and it really sucked as I def use it in my build.
---
Oh, so you can read? That‚Äôs surprising. So why couldn‚Äôt you understand anything I had written in this thread?
---
Omg, survivors get to bring 4 items on a team with 2 add ons each, for a total of 8 add ons and you wanna remove the killers add-ons? Like killers need more of a disadvantage. Killers builds rely on add ons too much. That sounds way too overpowered and could make SWF a guaranteed win at any rank. It would only be fair if killer could use an add-on that removes all of the survivors items off a team
---
Yea like I've got some random shit on every survivor since I leveled them all to 40 for their teachables but I don't really ever play any of them beyond Feng and bigbooty Jane
---
I think the happy clown stuff isn't that good, just personal opinion tho ofc
---
You have a picture of you disconnecting from haddonfield because you're too poor of a player to play on it ad being proud about it, lol. Imagine doing this 1v1 me tier shit on this game
---
Didn‚Äôt even see your post lol sorry man
---
*Happy Feng Min noises*
---
Ring around the Rosie with generator simulator thrown in perhaps?
---
If you have your region set to one that actually has the game out you can just search for "Dead By Daylight" in the app store.
---
So one out of many is what I‚Äôm hearing. 
---
Yes. Sloppy is meta. Meta doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs in the best build, it means that it‚Äôs used frequently. Not everyone uses the best builds all the time. You‚Äôre an example. Self care isn‚Äôt in the best builds. 
---
And sloppy just makes survivors who self care look stupid so killers have a reason to run it.
---
Probably got his ass kicked by Ghostface and is now salty because of it.
---
No I don't think so.
---
it wasn't supposed to taken in a malicious way lol, it's just true.
---
I praise it before every Survivor game, the Feng god is a helpful one.
---
where did you get this info? did the devs make a blog?
---
Spirit looks 17 or 18 at least
---
That‚Äôs correct, but you can place it mid chase without delay, unlike hag and trapper.
---
It‚Äôs constant pressure that is absolutely effortless for Freddy, if people are blowing up gens or getting off of them every 60 seconds it‚Äôs like a permanent Hex Ruin, but we‚Äôll have to wait for the PTB to actually know for sure.
---
Uhh I didn't make the first claim, I was just agreeing with another person's remark on the post. Why would I list want makes him fine, when the person complaining didn't list what was wrong? Also I don't really know how to make points as to why I think he's in a good spot, other than his add ons and with perks he's great at tracking people. I don't have an issue with him, so why would I list reasons? You seemed to want to counter that, if I don't have an issue how can I know without someone telling where they think his flaws are?
---
ToO oP nErF hIm NoW
---
This rework was never intended to make him a god tier killer, it was intended to make Freddy Krueger actually feel like Freddy Krueger, and not "sharp glove man with boring playstyle".
---
They mentioned Freddy can't see which one belongs to which survivor, not that they're not highlighted for him.
---
Nah Bond sucks,  run SC with Botany and Resilience. 99% yourself at a decent speed and then go make up that time doing faster gens and just top up if the killer is close or coming.
---
I collected [every cosmetic entry submission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Syv_f4LmB2dGu-SV49yttT3lEAfixpqHRZJyIOYeU1w/edit?usp=sharing) and am going to be posting leading to the reveal of the winner!

"Do you want a killer that is mediocre at best or one that might actually be viable?"
---
I'm literally saying the opposite.
---
I just find Legion to be more fun than Ghostface.
---
Then again i just like chasing.
---
You want to explain how it was "unhealthy" or do you just want to keep repeating that it was?
---
the rework was literally stated multiple times as being intended to make Freddy viable
---
Which is usually where you hear the ‚Äútunneling‚Äù bit the most. It might very well be part of the game, but it is in no way fun for that person, especially when they don‚Äôt even break 3k points.
---
And yes, if you want to know, it‚Äôs usually me getting tunneled. But I really only ever do gens and save teammates. None of this toxic noise some others do.
---
 Nurses or Sloppy instead of Save the Best For Last
---
Legion
---
I‚Äôll agree to disagree
---
Meta, most effective tactic available. Tactic is singular so no it's not meta. 
---
I just said I was out, if you wanna go crazy about it then more power to you. If you need a complete list I'm sure I can compile one for you but the smarter-than-thou approach isnt doing you favors lol.
---
He just doesnt really have a way to make loops easier on himself
---
I said I did everything and I mean it. I hide behind walls they assume I‚Äôm there and I‚Äôm caught, no pallets nearby to save me. Even when there are pallets, they just perfectly fucking read me as I try to loop them or break the pallet anyway forcing me to run and there‚Äôs no more pallets and boom hook oh what‚Äôs that you hid in a locker well the killer likes lockers so ya fucked oh what‚Äôs that team mate nearby oh well he lead the killer to you to escape and now ya fucked oh what‚Äôs that you haven‚Äôt moved from the beginning because you play conservatively well guess what happens next?
---
Think I‚Äôm exaggerating? Nope. I really wish I wasn‚Äôt.
---
You took the words right out of my mouth. Take my upvote.

You used the exact same template for the same type of joke and the title is word for word. I don't care that much since it was low effort but come on don't pretend otherwise. 
---
I said you did improve it anyway lol.
---
Thanks dawg, appreciate it.
---
Probably the pig who un-crouched in the tall grass
---
So he has to win a chase to use his traps in chases? Great. Just great.
---
This, 100%
---
I float around in ranks 6-10 depending on how much time I have in the month to play. I find he works well in that range of rank. I don't have an opinion from ranks 1-5, but he's been great for me at tracking and locating people. And then mind gaming on illusion pallets. He's not a top tier killer, but he's a strong mid tier, which I feel is where he can stay.
---
It says that my account is not valid for use in the region I chose which was Norway. It then tells me to switch to the U.S store to download it but when I do, it says I am not allowed to download it on the U.S S
---
store :/
---
I'm not against them releasing cosmetics at all, and many of them look very nice. They really do. But compared to the chapters that they release, I think they are overpriced.
---
Well it so happens on a real killer like spirit, sloppy is meta. Good work though. 
---
I asked a question since you made a bold statement and you couldn‚Äôt back it up. That‚Äôs not me being smarter, that‚Äôs you being lazy. 
---
Don‚Äôt run self care. Noob3 isn‚Äôt the best. See ya around.
---
Man you are a one trick pony. I get it fetal alcohol syndrome and all that, but at least try something original.
---
The worst feeling in the world is when you could‚Äôve saved someone but the game doesn‚Äôt register the pallet hit because you dropped it a millisecond too early.
---
you can still escape if the trap was put after all gens were done
---
Caption BELOW the meme? Bruh moment
---
yes I think the same but there are many people wanted
---
Level 3 is 100 percent more at 4 safe unhooks or protection hits. The BP gain really adds up. Super helpful for leveling up and getting teachables for everyone faster
---
I use that cosmetic but I‚Äôm not toxic, I‚Äôm not even good :(
---
23 years old??? Jesus I'm almost 30. 
---
Oh God oh fuck
---
Devs don't think enough about how a killer could abuse tunneling.
---
Some hard to swallow pills for some killer "mains"
---
And survivors get them off fast. They don't exactly work in her favor most of the time, since it's based on RNG. Not to mention that she only has 4 of them, and some survivors pop the next gen despite the RBT on their head since it does absolutely nothing at that point.
---
That‚Äôs what you get bitch for hitting on the hook.
---
just out here tryna be unique, ya feel me?
---
The worst is when it was someone I was just chasing but lost.
---
Care to elaborate? How would Wraith be better in Lery's/game map than GF?
---
Well, you got a point there, so let's avoid the addons part I think.
---
Freddy is not very good as of right now this rework is needed and will make Freddy much more viable.
---
As far as I know, if Freddy can‚Äôt still see your aura in dream world then it‚Äôs not a huge priority to get out of it. It does give you the benefit of hearing the lullaby.
---
Except Iron Will isn't a crutch, and it's not the perk's fault RNG has disfavored you. And nowhere did I say you should always run it, so don't put words in my mouth.
---
There you go. Everyone has a good time.  
---
Except the Killer.  
---
It is absolutely mandatory that the Killer not have a good time.
---
No one knows how viable his powers will be, and we won‚Äôt until he releases. But from what I understand they removed the sleep transition and Freddy can hit any survivor, so that ALONE is a buff. In the event that:
---
-Teleporting has a 10sec challenging time and 2 min cooldown
---
-traps hinder only 1%
---
-fake pallets are a different colour
---
The rework is still beneficial because they removed the sleep transition. 
---
I only see buffs and no nerfs and I was asking for someone to tell me the downsides of the rework
---
**YOU FOOL, YOU‚ÄôVE DOOMED US ALL!**
---
Poolside hawt
---
If you bought the game for 20.00 and bought each 5 dollar dlc separate it would be like 170. If you just bought the dlc that you cant use shard on it would be just 70.
---
Um...no. They fall alseep passively, he gets stleath to get an easy hit, can teleport to hit them. 
---
Then they have to deal with the traps/pallets, and can just rehit them if wake up. 
---
Not to mention  that if they wake up, it takes alot of time.
---
Sloppy with nurses (niche for spirit of course), is a clarification on your statement aka moving the goal posts so it's you being just as lazy chief.
---
I just said sorry it was lazy, I'm sorry I made a salt post and you decided to educate me while expecting me to be googling facts for you when I'm out. I told you and you didnt care, but whatever dude. GL in the fog. 
---
And noob3 is easily one of the best survivors in the game when playing seriously.
---
Freddy was not uniuie can you just accept that already?
---
Why isn't not always nea?
---
1.  He‚Äôs slower than a survivor while revving it up, so if you just run around something in a circle he can‚Äôt catch up
---
2. He can‚Äôt turn well after the first second of the charge, so you can attempt to trick him into thinking you are going one way and then change directions.
---
The best thing you can do is just vault a window so that he doesn‚Äôt have the chance, but sometimes he‚Äôll still hit you through it.
---
If your only response is to say "No, it's what I think!", I'm done responding to you.
---
I would bring up that when you were around my age you honestly were so dim witted that you thought you didn‚Äôt have to pay back your student loans because you were horrible at managing money and preferred to spend it on pot and other luxuries, but I guess I just prefer to conduct myself a bit more civilly.
---
Except he was. Don't get salty and demand that I accept your point of view.
---
I don‚Äôt think looping should be in this because survivors are absolutely helpless without looping, imagine if every pallet you ran to you dropped instantly. Gen rushing tho is a problem I do agree with that.
---
I have ALWAYS argued that Freddy was fun the way he was. He was even one of my 3 favorite killers. Dress add ons and the paintbrush add on made him unstoppable. I genuinely enjoyed always being able to see where survivors were, and their slowed down action speed could grind game progress down to a halt.
---
If they change those two things about him, I imagine I wont ever play him again, unfortunately
---
Monster Hunter World.
---
HE'S NOT OP AT ALL, HIS POWER IS REALLY USELESS IF YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR CAMERA ON A SWIVEL. THE WHOLE POINT OF HIM IS TO BE PRETTY CONSISTENT AT GETTING FIRST HITS AND THE OCCASIONAL INSTADOWN AS A BONUS, BUT AFTER THAT HE IS JUST ANOTHER M1 KILLER WITH NO MAP PRESSURE.
---
that's the most meme logic approach to a build I've heard so far
---
Nothing but a survivor hate circle-jerk down here,  move along.
---
Ghostface is an animul plus you can scare the shit outta ppl
---
almost as if the community consists of more than 1 person. Wow!
---
This is like. Hurtful? Why would you bend the laws of space and time and put the caption below the meme? You may have created an interdimensional rift because of how drastic this situation is.
---
no we can not be ban for that but do not change them when the game opens
---
What is meme logic?
---
Always run self care, replace with iron will = always run iron will. Just some logic btw, so I read your logic... or were you not being logical? Idk man.
---
That doesnt change the fact that the perk sucks pretty badly pre-t3. Idk, it solves half the problem without the time imo, so I understand it just disagree.
---
Console
---
Isn't there 2 chase themes? The normal and then a more guitar-y one?
---
I cant help but wonder about the dlc characters though. I dont want to rebuy them and any cosmetics I have for original survivors.
---
Even if you want to play one side, you should play both sides. Makes you learn how the other side may think, and how it works, and you can use that knowledge when playing your main side.
---
Welcome to the Beautiful game of dead by daylight
---
I know you‚Äôre not exaggerating. This game can be toxic as hell and there are plenty of balancing issues, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs hopeless. You‚Äôre already highlighting the things you want to work on, regardless of how you‚Äôre saying it: Why are you getting caught with few/no pallets? Are there better areas of the map? Why is the killer finding you behind walls? Are there any perks to prevent that? Are you using your equipment in the most effective way possible? What about perks/addons? Why is the killer reading you so easily? Are there things you might not have tried that would make you harder to read? Why is the killer catching you off-guard/in the Open? I can already tell you‚Äôve thought of these things before, but if you dig into them a little further you will absolutely improve your game.
---
Just run no mither, why are you even healing.
---
#tall
---
We've moved away from the whole "ooooh, who is the killer, can't wait to find out" types. There are a few that are like that and for good reasons: Michael, Ghostface, Wraith and Hag. All of which depend on the element of surprise. Freddy does not need that.
---
Now this is the solution to everything, I should've seen it LOL
---
yeah i know it happens all the time
---
you‚Äôre a dumbass..
---
While sleeping, you can be hit by a slow from Freddy (which is kinda Clowns slow). Also, your aura will be visible inside the small zone 16 m. You can be hit disregarding the status (if you were awake, you can easily be hit and pulled into a dream, no more waiting, yeah). Also, all survivors fall asleep every 60 seconds disregarding the time they were hit-pulled. And yeah, you can no longer wake up before being fully healed. Hope this helps.
---
On the other side, no more spotting survivors and having a vision of them while sleeping outside the radius. Now, it is inside
---
Is that a variety pack? I thought they meant the chapter would get skins.
---
**bigsad**
---
Glad you agree. Phew we really cleared that up.
---
I just want a hot Dwight. Like that‚Äôs it, please.
---
*you're* disabled I'd say
---
Whilst I agree Freddy may not have been the best for the games health, stating that people are factually wrong for liking something is completely wrong.
---
Having the opinion of liking something (in this case Freddy) is completely subjective, whether Freddy was good for the game or not has nothing to do with that.
---
People are allowed to have their own opinions, including liking a killer that wasn't the best for the game. Nothing factually wrong with that since liking something is never factually wrong.
---
i don't care that survivors *can* loop, I just care that it's so fucking strong. Looping buys so much time for so little effort, and that's not even considering maps like Haddonfield that are ten times worse.
---
A free hit after 3-7 seconds is still always worse than a free hit immediately. Just because you can think of things to make Freddy stronger doesn't mean he is any stronger than any other killer.
---
Or making corn in the corn.
---
It looks like your issue is cutting the loop too wide.  A little more practice and you'll get the hang of it!
---
I feel a ‚ÄúRanked‚Äù and ‚ÄúCasual‚Äù mode is what most games do, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be a good idea here. It take a long time to match already and most people seem to take Casual more seriously than Ranked
---
love how they make the outfits a tiny bit more so you have to buy $15 worth haha so fucking greedy.
---
Im not talking about a loop or anything. Im talking about how that hatchet hit me
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, all he has to do is follow a survivor to the chest.
---
I read in the last anniversary stream they were going to make Red Paint Brush cause all four survivors to start the match already asleep, and skill checks won't wake you up anymore.
---
Swift Hunt add-ons unless you stack the White and Blood versions, which only cuts off a whopping .6 seconds from the 3 second uncloak as well as keeping you at a rather cucked 126% movement speed, so until those add-ons are buffed or when bing bong boi doesn't have a horrible uncloak time, I'd recommend not using them.  
---
When it comes to a well rounded build for Wraith the involves both mobility and tracking, I'd recommend Windstorm and All Seeing, and the latter's detection range in its Blood variant is deceptively long, which can help in early game downs or finding the last survivor during EGC. Windstorm should be a no-brainer given that even the green-rarity version makes you so much faster.  
---
However, there's an add-on combo that I have never seen 99% of other Wraith's use but is terrifying to go against; Shadow Dance and Windstorm. Not only do you get to move fast, but every other action you do while cloaked is fast as fuck. Break pallets? Half the pallets are gone before the average Ruin placement gets destroyed. Vault windows? Vault-master Myers can eat it. But most importantly, not only is searching lockers affected by it, but also pulling survivors out of lockers is at an unholy speed, meaning less time spent on going through the shitty animation and more time going F A S T.  
---
As for perk builds, my go to is; Shadowborn (yes, I'm unironically recommending this), BBQ, Ruin, and Nurse's Calling. If you don't have Ruin or BBQ because shrine fucked you over or if you're a PC player and you have to pay for hag because of it, I recommend running Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, Shadowborn yet again, and finally a flex slot for either QoL or other things (like NOED, Iron Grasp, Enduring, etc).  
---
As for an optimal playstyle, a lot of or first hits on survivors will involve finding them on generators with a corner spot open, getting the first hit will still have relative ease providing a survivor isn't near a pallet or doesn't have sprint burst (keep in mind that survivors in corner spots can still SB away if they see your shimmer), but the best way to counter that is by faking an uncloak to either make them run to a pallet and throw it down, or waste up their SB or other exhaustion perks, most of the time you don't even have to reach the first bing during your uncloak to make them rush away or throw down a pallet. In normal chase scenarios you have to play as an m1 killer, don't respect pallets (especially if you have enduring), play as a bloodlust gamer at certain loop tiles you don't know how to counter yet, and other things like mindgames and things like that (which I can provide a detailed list of Wraith mindgames that work consistently in every rank).  
---
May you find happy bing bongs and constant bloody party streamers, see you in the fog.
---
All streamers get regularly escaped on by playing fair. I thought you were implying you were better than them, but now I realize you just don't play at rank 1 and don't play much in general. 
---
If you start getting to rank 1 and playing there as killer (like the streamers you like), you'll get escaped on like they do too.
---
Congratulations, you just showed a perfectly normal hit if you take ping in consideration and the fact that hatchets hitboxes are ball shaped. Your hitbox isn't in the spot you highlighted, your "local model" is. 
---
There is a split second difference between where you see your character and where your character actually is in the killer's screen, since he has zero ping. 
---
The higher the ping, the bigger the distance difference. 
---
This is why devs rarely take these complaints seriously, 9 out 10 complaints, people have no idea what they are talking about.
---
any other Killer besides Nurse wouldn't be able to get a free hit *at all* in those situations, so it is something that Freddy can do that most Killers can't. when you pair this with the great stall that Freddy has, and the aura reading on top of that, Freddy was a lot better than people thought he was.
---
Micheal myers for me because i haven‚Äôt really played against spirit. It‚Äôs all fun and games until you hear that damned but catchy theme song from the stalky boi
---
No it doesn't. Failing any skillcheck will still wake you up instantly. And he doesn't get stealth anymore, he is seen far away and intermittently up close. And the teleport has a huge telegraph. And dealing with the traps isn't hard, as they only slow you down shortly and you have to be fully asleep for that and Freddy has to waste time setting them up beforehand. He can also no longer see auras of survivors that are asleep, so he can't track for shit.
---
Expect he wasnt. All he was was Steall and Aura reading. He had no unqiuie playstyle, nothing that acaullty mattered.
---
Green ping but k
---
You dont have to be new to know the community is garbage. They are going to whine until we no longer want to play because their demands ruined the game.
---
Benny hill theme when?
---
*Laughs in Ethernet*
---
Do we know when they announcing the winners ? Are they showing off finalists ?
---
Tell me how each of those killers is better then Freedy in Tracking and Stall, and how they dont have it? 
---
Because each one i listed does, and have more then Freddy had.
---
That's funny, it's probably a decent pallet once that door opens after the generator is completed but survivors wasting pallets is common practice :P
---
This happened with a Quentin who was teabagging all game, people just forget that they have it on their head even when I‚Äôm not chasing them.
---
my brother bought that guy. his friends get pissed off with him when he uses him because he keeps taking everyone out in customs. one of his friends had me dying because he went ‚ÄúWhy the hell is allowed to use ghostface but you guys don‚Äôt let me use micheal myers‚Äù XD
---
&gt;This is strong but requires coordination to pull off and takes risk to fully pay off.
---
&gt;This is also strong and would primarily be used to counter Moris, but you run the risk of negating a beneficial offering as well such as Bloody Party Streamers.
---
SWF exists
---
Hes going to be a really big survivor.
---
The moment when someone turns salty and starts to insult you because they don't want to put in the effort to actually solve their problem.
---
And that thing about you always running Self Care and thinking that I told you to always run Iron Will (which I didn't) is your problem, not mine. Lmao.
---
No, he won‚Äôt be able to see any auras in the dream world or real world.  At least not without add-one, which they haven‚Äôt given the specifics of yet so maybe sometimes but for what we know now, no.
---
Salty survivor mains got a whiff of a viable killer somewhere in the same postal code as them.
---
July 18th and no
---
&gt;Green ping but k
---
Even 20ms is still higher than 0ms and there is also small lag spikes to consider but by all means, continue to complain about a non existent problem (regarding this specific case, not that hitboxes aren't problematic in some cases).
---
Sounds more complicated than it is. Freddy can always hit you, and you can always see Freddy, aura reading and slower actions removed. As survivor after 60 seconds you fall asleep and can be affect by traps. As Freddy right click at generator to teleport, and right click ground to put snare that slows and reveal survivors. Interact with white aura'ed box while asleep to wake up.
---
Hitboxes are just broken these days.....
---
Thats not how % work skeletal
---
Stealth, aura-reading, stall, you had to learn how to actually use the aura-reading strategically to learn which survivor to focus on instead of others who are asleep.... Lmao.
---
You didn't read their comment, it explained it well, go read it again.  
---
Killers host the games, therefore experience 0 ping.  
---
In addition hurtboxes and hitboxes are different from character/item models.
---
I think the keyword is ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù and not completely out of the realm of possibility like other classic horror films.
---
It‚Äôs very possible for someone wearing that costume, mask and draping robe to trip over things or not see things coming.
---
It‚Äôs hard to do real-life comparison to other murders because they very rarely try to put on an act or costume for the fun of it. They usually have one goal: kill and/or steal/molest etc.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted though I think its an interesting discussion, this subreddit is so hostile toward opinion or things they disagree with it‚Äôs so unwelcoming.
---
You can get Legion for free if you don't mind grinding 9000 Shards.
---
So Ghostface &gt; Legion
---
Lol of course I'm still lying right....jesus christ you're predictable man.  I've got nothing to prove to you dude.  If you refuse to believe me that's on you.  Again it just speaks to the weakness of your killer play that it is inconceivable to you that it's possible to play fun competitive games at red ranks and still be successful.  If all you're going to do is default to the go to "he must be lying because he doesn't agree with me" horseshit than I'm done talking to you.  Waste of my time.
---
‚ÄúPlz nerf.‚Äù Fuckin survivors.
---
Wait, I'm salty? Because I asked if you were being logical? Idk dawg, someones touchy. 
---
Your logic is my problem, not yours... oooooookay dude. GL in the fog.
---
I didn't say nobody had it, don't put words in my mouth. I'm saying anyone else's tracking and stall is nowhere near Freddy's.
---
Been there, buddy. I heard a heartbeat and panicked so I jumped down and intercepted a T3 Micheal stab who was lunging for a

&gt;Hitboxes are just broken these days.....
---
In some cases they are indeed but people usually complain about latency related hits, which is your case. You can't expect devs to fix something that can't be fixed. The only way to completely remove this problem would be to play DBD on LAN environment.
---
So what youre saying is that on the killer screen, that is a hit, right? But i play huntress all the time and i see this from the killers perspective as well. The hitboxes are genuinly broken, the ping differences just make it more noticable.
---
This is the satisfying slam when a killer is tunneling you and you hit them with a pallet successfully
---
Why do I hear boss music?
---
The trapper version is fine lol
---
In simple terms, it measures lag. The bigger the number, the more lag there is.
---
For a more literal meaning, the ping number represents how long it takes for information to reach the server. 1000ms ping is equal to one second.
---
It wold be cool if those blood puddles on the floor he can set didn't alert Freddy but instead made the survivor go slower as they sink into it like on the movies. This is just my opinion though
---
It doesn't help that I have barely the faintest idea what OP is suggesting.
---
Snarky, since you insinuated I wasn't logical just because you don't agree with my argument. Seems like you're the touchy one.
---
And literally your own assumption that I meant to always use Iron Will instead of Self Care, in addition to refusing to run a perk that will fix your problem because you consider it a "crutch", is definetly not my problem. Think about the problems you're having and follow the suggestions people are trying to give you to fix it.
---
Hey good on him for getting you. Im rank 11 and got a rank 3 in my lobby. He ended up getting away lol
---
Unsure what to think, I was expecting a beast but I don‚Äôt know.
---
He‚Äôs basically hag but can only teleport to generators and takes 4 second?
---
Trapper but his traps only work when you are asleep and don‚Äôt hurt you, just slow you down?
---
I kinda liked old Freddy when you could put someone to sleep and kick generator and see their red outline.
---
WoaH WAIT A MINUTE
---
HUNTRESS IS GETTING A SKIN???
---
I literally heard nothing of this til now omf
---
Well it takes ages to self heal with it so there's that, and medkits are a thing...
---
Looping isn't the point technically, the only objective is to do the 5 gens and escape, how you get there is up to you.
---
Which is also wrong. 
---
Doctor's tracking is way better then Freedy's by a long shot. Legion has better in chase tracking with Killer insiict. 
---
Pig, Doctor, Plague all have in built game stall with their power system, along with Legion. 
---
Wraith, Ghostface and Myers all had better stleath.
---
Yeah but when it was compared to NOED in this sub, of course everyone said they weren‚Äôt even close to equal
---
Tune in to tru3ta1ent much?
---
And none of that really did anything to help him. Oh so you know where they are, good luck running across the enitre map before they wake up, then having to wait 10 seconds to hit them.
---
Enjoy that existential crisis my man
---
The traps do cause survivors to scream, so he does have some tracking yes.
---
lmao boy with freddy rework coming after the live stream hes gonna be worse
---
&gt;So what youre saying is that on the killer screen, that is a hit, right? But i play huntress all the time and i see this from the killers perspective as well. The hitboxes are genuinly broken, the ping differences just make it more noticable.
---
Yes I've also seen some BS hits from both perspectives when it comes to Hatchets. I wouldn't say they are broken but some hits look like scams mostly because of the hatchet hitbox shape. By being a huge basketball rather than an actually hatchet shaped, it forgives a lot of otherwise missed shot. When they tried to make it an actual hitbox they literally killed Huntress. 
---
But, even then, we can clearly see that OP is trying to complain about the fact that he was (on his screen) far away from where the hatchet landed.
---
I think he means instead of coming out with two skins and charging 10 each they could make two skins one for each side and charging just 10 for both.
---
oh there‚Äôs a freddy rework?
---
I like his new rework. Considering getting him
---
Not recently, the balance complaining got to me. Respect him tho, I watch mostly smaller guys plus noob3.
---
Doctor's tracking is only once every couple of seconds at best with the Doctor illusions and once rvery time a survivor screamed and tiered up. Definitely nowhere near as good as Freddy's map-wide aura-reading. And none of those killers' stall abilities were as good as Freddy's baseline 50% action speed debuff. 
---
Wraith, Ghostface, and Myers' stealth definitely are nowhere near as good as true, 100% invisibility (RIP Wraith).
---
I agree,
---
  I was however just using cases that I‚Äôm familiar with whether it be from internet study or actual work
---
It is realistic in some degrees and could absolutely happen for the most part (minus some over dramatic things they tend to put into the movies     At first bc that was the style and later as comedic tools) 
---
And I‚Äôm only comparing to premeditated not the ones that happen in a fit of emotion or just because he/she could
---
And very true this subreddit is full on hostile  to differing opinions.     Not taking time to discuss and/or find middle ground seems to be a staple of the community
---
Looping actually takes a bit of skill and game sense. If killer mains really wanna see how survivors act play as them. That‚Äôs what I did. Played a bunch of survivor when I first started and now I play killer I know when to break off chases and such.
---
Don‚Äôt litter! Pick up your rubbish always kids
---
If they're dumb enough to step into the GIANT OBVIOUS POOLS OF BLOOD, sure. But they could also just easily wake themselves up and never have to deal with traps or freddy.

[COSMETIC REVEAL | MID-CHAPTER 3.0.0](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68065/bookmark-cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-3-0-0)
---
People are dumb enough to step in Trapper traps are they not? And then they waste time by waking up thus stalling.
---
They really aren't. NOED is more comparable to adrenaline if anything. Current NOED has guaranteed counterplay and a risk. Old DS had zero counterplay unless a survivor was dumb enough to go down within dribbling distance of a hook.
---
Dope, thank you!! I was working this week so I hadn't had time to check the update out yet :&gt;
---
My point being he doesn't run self care.
---
I understand a +16 second down time (base heal time 32 seconds with self heal) the effective value of 16 seconds, for me, does not have enough worth to risk looking for healing through other ways. I understand why people dont do it, I just prefer the perk and I know a lot of others do... that's all.
---
Why? What curse manifested itself inside of you to make this post?
---
I sort of miss the ignorance of thinking that hitting someone on the hook makes them die faster.
---
Simpler times, and looking like a total dumbass.
---
Freddy is invisble but gives himself away with the Lullbay. Doctor's has really good tracking with the fake doctors. 
---
It doesnt matter how good they were, the problem was they werent fun for the game. They were boring systems. 
---
I would rather have a killer who stalls with a power then just makes survivors worse by doing nothing. Freddy's entire power was litrtrely just a passive and its boring and bland.
---
Except it did help him. Most Freddies don't know how to use the aura-reading to it's full potential nor are aware/experienced enough to know when to drop something and prioritize a more important survivor (such as one who is doing an action to try and wake up). Plus, there are add-ons to lessen the chances of skillchecks to wake up.
---
I love this! Video games are supposed to be fun. You don‚Äôt win all of them. Half the time if people could just realize it‚Äôs not life or death there wouldn‚Äôt be so much salt in the end game chat. They play like they‚Äôre actually going to get sacrificed.
---
I'm only defending people getting paid for their work. It's silly to think that I'd continue working on a project if I wasn't continuing to get paid for it. To continue paying me, my company has to continue making money. Behaviour has to make money to continue paying their team to support the game. Premium cosmetics (which don't affect how the game is played) are a source of incoming money that allows them to keep that team funded. (That team is significantly larger now as well.) If you don't feel like they're worth it or you disagree with the model, it's your choice not to buy them.
---
Just because other games may offer all of their cosmetics for free doesn't mean every game has to offer the same options. We're not entitled to free cosmetics - it's nice that they offer customization options at all. They keep playable DLC at reasonable prices, and allows us to get quality of life updates throughout the lifespan of the game.
---
Are you implying that Dwight isn't already hot?
---
&gt;Red Paint brush: All survivors start asleep, and skillchecks will no-longer wake them up.

&gt;skillchecks will no-longer wake them up.

whaaaaaaaaat

this must come with some tragic downside
---
Go awff
---
I love you all
---
- Survivor main that loves getting mori
---
Were you trying to kill a survivor? Sounds like killer entitlement to me
---
Interesting, I know people dont run it, the pros and cons are even-ish versus something like iron will/bond. I just prefer relying on myself I suppose.
---
How is Aura reading going to help him when he CANT HIT ANYONE. He knows where they are, and then what? He gets looped around and ran around then is forced to wait to trigger his power again. 
---
You can not honestluy say his new power is worse then the one he has now.
---
And now the Lullaby is nondirectional, only telling you he's near but not exactly where he is. You could be walking right into his LOS.
---
Boring to you, perhaps.
---
I agree it was kind of passive, but a killer who literally cannot hit anyone until they're asleep demands having a strong power to make it worthwhile.
---
Well everyone complains about adrenaline here too so I mean still
---
It‚Äôs too bad furtive chase is an awful perk in general, especially after the fix.
---
I locker grabbed a dwight in that outfit and moried him as the pig and his friend tried to flashlight me
---
Like bud
---
That's not how that works
---
*facepalm* I literally just addressed that, read my comment again.
---
I know right?
---
So they are not mad because your good at hag?
---
yeah go on dead by daylight channel and you see the recent vid making him way more powerful no more bs 7 sec wait to attack more traps and teleportation and fake pallets
---
I want Randy!
---
That legion must have been raging.  Lmao.
---
And for extra Information, it takes 4 (Or 5, I can‚Äôt remember) seconds to teleport. It goes by 15% faster for every person that is in the Dream World. For context, here is what it would look like:
---
1 asleep: 3.4 seconds
---
2 asleep: 2.8 seconds 
---
3 asleep: 2.2 seconds
---
4 asleep: 1.6 seconds
---
Well, he did say he should quit drinking.
---
I mostly want Sidney because my name is Sydney üòÇ but Randy would be fun too!
---
I did. And again, how does it help him when he can't ever hit a survivor? Knowing where they are doesn't help if you cant end a chase.
---
He seemed pretty spot on for that game.
---
It was a spirit gen grabber build and survivors would hop off whenever he went to grab them (even before they had IDed who the killer was). They also popped ruin really quickly at the start of the match (but that can happen anyway)
---
He is callous and can be self congratulatory, but he is correct most of the time. I've never really known him to be wrong, but I dont watch his streams, just vids.
---
How is looping not the point when the game gives you chase points? It‚Äôs hard to loop the killer. They are faster, they lunge, they have traps and tricks. Just be lucky the survivors don‚Äôt have guns! Cause if I had my 6 gun I‚Äôd blopp um with the exception of Freddy and the spirit
---
Fake pallets might help out
---
It's annoying to go against and can *SEEM* op in certain circumstances. I wouldn't mind seeing some QOL changes for NOED and Adrenaline where neither activate inside a chase.
---
No every match I play with the hag I annihilate and it‚Äôs annoying fending off and defending myself because they try to call me trash when theyre the one who obviously didn‚Äôt survive.
---
They are there for hex perks. If someone runs NOED or Ruin or something, in the case of Ruin, a random dull totem on the map will be replaced by a hex totem. If you want to get rid of Ruin's effect you need to find the lit up totem and destroy it. In the case of NOED, after the exit gates are powered, a random dull totem is turned into hex totem and the survivors will be exposed until someone destroys the hex totem. This can be kept from activating entirely if the survivors can destroy all 5 dull/hex totems on the map. 
---
TL;DR: Hex perks rely on hex totems. Destroy the totems, stop the perk from working. You can negate certain perks by destroying all 5 totems before perks can activate.
---
Which it honestly wasnt. All it did was slow the game down and tell him where they were. That doesn't help him in a chase, it doesnt help him stop loops, it doesnt help him hit survivors.
---
A lot of people thought they‚Äôd just have to wait until they are fully asleep
---
Prayer beads should be an ultra rare addon
---
The biggest problem I have with the whole thing is the ability to hit survivors that aren‚Äôt asleep. Literally what is the purpose of the power of putting them to sleep then? It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôm more angry about it because I‚Äôm literally a Freddy Main.  I found a way to be viable with him, and I spent a long time figuring it out. This whole rework makes that work a waste of my time. That‚Äôs mildly infuriating. I prided myself on getting good with him. Now I have to almost completely relearn him? Not the main point but that‚Äôs how it makes me feel. 
---
And you won‚Äôt change my mind about the rip off hybrid power. Call a spade a spade. This is a half thought rework that is made to shut people up. That‚Äôs what BHVR does. They get sick of people screaming at them about something. So they ‚Äúfix‚Äù or ‚Äúrework‚Äù something by overthinking and over complicating and essentially BREAKING what ever it is. That way half the people complaining will shut up. And if people still don‚Äôt like it? Well it‚Äôs broken and now no one likes it so they will just stop using it. BHVR has one of the LAZIEST Dev teams I have ever seen in my entire life. I thought the DCUO and Ark devs were bad? Jesus Christ BHVR takes the cake. And on top of that they have huge egos that doesn‚Äôt allow them to see their poor decisions. This entire rework is a poor decision. There were so many ways they could have changed him and made him more viable. 
---
But the bottom line was:
---
This rework wasn‚Äôt needed. At all. Freddy is not meant for top tier. Not all killers are. That‚Äôs reality people don‚Äôt want to accept. Freddy is also not an easy killer to master. His difficultly level is similar to Nurse when reaching higher ranks. You have to figure out how to use his power effectively and have immense patience with him. Plenty of Freddy mains figured that out Agee‚Äôs ago. People like to tell me I‚Äôm wrong, but then the moment I teach them how I play him, and how a lot of people play him, they realize, ‚ÄúHoly shit he so potentially OP and lethal its insane!‚Äù 
---
And you‚Äôre stuck on the trapper thing when it‚Äôs one example. Ghostface is a joke. He is still broken and his power doesn‚Äôt make any damn sense. I do not consider him to be the real Ghostface. If ANYONE is GF it‚Äôs Legion. Legion should have been scrapped, and the original inspiration for Legion should have been given to Ghostface. Period. 
---
I‚Äôm clearly not going to change your mind. And you won‚Äôt change mine. I‚Äôve seen so many games head down the road that DBD is going and all I can say is I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the game died by next year.
---
This is what I always do, let them unhook while I'm bashing gens and chasing their friends. Plus actually sacing the survivors only gets you like 200 points, so I just try to get everyone equally. 
---
Plus you're right it totally wastes their BT :)
---
Wtf is this? This is not how you use this format.
---
If you prioritize survivors who look like they're trying to wake up and stop them, they can't wake up.... Freddy has to use his aura-reading to the utmost and juggle survivors harder than any other killer.
---
Also, he can chase a survivor for a little bit and let them chew through pallets, then go to another survivor who is more important. Freddy is literally about a war of attrition, making the game as long as possible while wearing survivors down.
---
That's being changed because it wasn't fair.
---
