The others are hard Im totally with you but they are doable. The challenge that seems absolutely broken to me is doing 4 gens in one trial. Sounds near impossible. You have to be playing with really garbage mates to complete that one. Hopefully they nerf it.
---
---
---
Toxic survivors wants to make the killer experience as miserable as possible, but when the killer does the same they go crazy.
---
😂😂 THATS THE FUN PART! Lol.
---
It looks like lag to me, but I have not played against Freddy in a while.
---
I've dealt with that before. Usually, I let the ones who are trying to farm do their own thing, and focus on the one that is still trying his damn best to flee, maybe to give him something to do, but also to get a free sacrifice when I would normally get none.
---
Games for sure can differentiate, but dbd is not doing it, at least yet. But games cannot distinguish between unplugging internet or turning off router, etc from a legitimate disconnect from game crashing or lag out. They can only tell if someone opens menu and then hits leave game. All other disconnects fall under the same category
---
Spine Chill is the best
---
Idk why you got downvoted lol. It's TRUE, if you have such a poor connection you consistently have a game crash or lag out, you should still be punished.
---
Omg yes I’m happy other people do this too. I think I do this mostly with my Laurie, like I never use Object on anyone but her because it feels right to be the self reliant and confident Laurie.
---
His lunge is the same as every other 115% movement speed killer
---
Yeah, but I only have one of his perks activated.
---
No doubt the bloody cosmetics are cool however I don’t think it’s worth it. I’d rather stay at 50 and just let the bloodweb go on for ever
---
1. Minute.
---
it was definitely lag lol but jokes at everyone coming at his lunge
---
For sure
---
It’s worth it to do it once but I’m not doing it again
---
his animations just broken lol this is satire.
---
Head on, d strike,  inner strength, quick and quiet, gang rise up
---
Which teachable perks did you get from the Shrine of Secrets by now?
---
WHY DOESN’T DEMOGORGON HAVE A FUCKING CHRISTMAS SWEATER?!  LIKE, THAT WOULD’VE BEEN THE CUTEST THING EVER NEXT TO ELF DWIGHT!!!! AHHHHHHHHH
---
I have a feeling this survivor was being toxic, why else would the killer be so angry.
---
&gt;on both sides
---

---
You new here?
---
Yoooo I want the Spirit and Oni one! I actually made an account just to comment and see where you would sell them at. It would be cool to see a Yui one too cause I started to main her. :)
---
This. I’m just trying to get shit done so I can get out and move onto the next game.
---
So I finally heard back from customer support. They sent me my tracking link but it’s coming from Latvia. Lol so probably not going to be here by Christmas is my guess.
---
BRUHHHHHHHH WHY DO I HAVE TO FIX 4 GENS?? I HAVE NO ONE TO QUEUE UP WITH HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET THIS CHALLENGE????? BTW HOOKING 5 AND SACRIFICE 4 PEOPLE IN THE BASEMENT IS LIKE EZ THO BUT BRUHHH.
---
They will be on holiday till jan 2.th so they probably dont change it..
---
I'm a survivor main and even I think it's dumb, I wish they'd think about things before implementing haha
---
Freddy
---
Mercury
---
You should probably rewrite it to say "gives survivors the Exposed effect" then.
---
This is so accurate, it hurts.
---
I can’t believe they didn’t get the hint after the backlash of the last set of challenges.
---
The strangers prey at night soundtrack
---
I got two to let me do it when we only needed two. Hopefully I can get so lucky. I plan to farm so...
---
Actually Inner Strength starts the moment you start entering a locker, so the two seconds to enter a locker quietly is a part of that 8 second heal timer. 
---
On top of that, cleansing totems is a good thing to do, and not only doing that but getting a heal on top of that- it rewards doing more than just holding m1 at a gen the entire game. Plus, I only need ONE perk to heal myself, leaving three open perk slots for anything else I need.
---
I'd sure like to fuck Billy

#Nea
---
It wasn’t I was walking around looking up and down and herd no one but my self , they all even left and I was still blinded
---
4K actually! His recent buffs help a lot!
---
[removed]
---
I know exactly what you mean, I played against some really good purple ranks as Legion and secured a 4k and got a Merciless Killer. I was still shit talked at the end of the game for "playing such a shitty killer, camping, and needing to learn the game." I was being such a sweaty try hard that whole match, running back and forth between gens and juggling the survivors as best as I could. I had a great time during that match. Like its not my fault I capitalized on some mistakes and them being too altruistic at times. I can't help that you got bested by a shit tier low ranking killer.
---
Truly ascended gameplay
---
"die."
---
You can't be serious. It would be impossible to loop or do anything after the first hit. You force survivors to heal constantly or else they suffer a huge penalty. This is absolutely game breaking.
---
this...
---
fucking. this.
---
Can we stop with all the ugly side-shaved hair styles. It's bad enough Kate got it, now Meg as well?
---
I despise it, man.
---
I'd say I'm above average at killer and when I match with survivors I know aren't that good, I try hard to make it fair, but like...
---
This Adam, man, he just **kept** running into me. Unhooked, runs into me, I check a gen, he runs into me, I hook someone, he runs into me.
---
After a few times, I just slugged him. I knew he'd call me a tunneller so I gave him the chance. Of course, game ends, check my Steam profile, "-rep, tunnelling pig, seriously annoying."
---
What the fuck do you want from me, Adam.
---
Also ur rank 2, wtf did they expect?
---
Don't fuck someone if you can't tell their face from their scrotum
---
Depends. If they've given up because of the killer or map choice sometimes they'll just stand there and take the two hits. 
---
Regardless, I don't get why you're so hung up on this specific point. I didn't even say it takes 20-30 seconds to hook a survivor, I said they keep the killer occupied for 20-30 seconds instead of just instantly leaving and letting the killer immediately move onto the next target. And when you add up everything involved with hooking a survivor instead of just hyper focusing in on just the carry-time + hook animation then it is definitely more  than 15 seconds.
---
What if I don’t want to fuck Billy?
---
Has tk be someones fetish.
---
because it’s already one of the greatest posts to ever surface on this sub
---
I’ll occasionally listen to the soundtrack of Persona 5.
---
The rituals are to try to get you out of your comfort zone and try the other side or characters.
---
Well, good luck to them, 'cos that shit ain't opening without a key with 2 survs *and* 2 gens.
---
Also crows.
---
It will be like how survivors who face infinite tier 3 tombstone Myers: they'll just deny them the hook instead of letting them do the challenge.
---
Yea absolutely, probably going to do it for my favorite killer or survivor then call it quits
---
I’m a billy main who uses infectionous fright... so I’m not going to say anything
---
I know that and it's a poor system, considering how infrequently you get rituals.
---
At this point they're just releasing characters that are just better models of the ones that look like crap. Yui is the better Nea and Steve is the better Quentin.
---
Couldn't agree more mate, you cant win ever argument. I guess its unfortunate you can try your best to have fun and play a game the way you wanna play it and still end up on someone else's "shit list" because you didn't play accordingly to another strategy. But hey I guess thats the beauty of the world eh.
---
Not really, it’s not extra points. They would just be getting the same points they would if hooked earlier, it’s not a separate bonus and you would still get more by actually doing stuff. Thats why they just get awarded struggle points and not given a bonus last man standing point grab
---
All i see here is a tbagger?
---
I personally have no problem with slugging
---
Yeah they were, but in theory it's all just about your connection to the server, I guess. It was never going to be a perfect solution. Plus the servers are still pretty new and they're still ironing things out.
---
I'm just thankful I'm not seeing Huntress get double hits anymore....
---
It wouldnt really be a challenge if you could just do it without going out of your normal play style...
---
I mean you get a sprint burst after getting hit which I never said to take away, I revised it to allow fast vaulting. My suggestion is to make the game last a touch longer. I also mentioned if this were to happen the mangled effect would need a nerf. Given that survivors have at minimum 3 get out of jail free things per chase (at most 8) I dont see how it's completely game breaking.
---
This whole sub is just killers bitching about how survivors aren’t nice to them, it’s fucking hilarious
---
What did you do to piss of the Entity?
---
He kinda deserved it. He face camped me. I just wanted my sweet revenge 😎
---
He got added to Switch last week
---
That what I was thinking too but not too sure yet!
---
Crouching while standing next to the space between the survivor and the base of the hook allows you to crouch in that gap, the killer can only hit you if they aim for a specific spot
---
Imagine only being able to take down people one at a time with your chainsaw
---
I call it bp farming
---
If you're saying that i'm some feminist who thinks that all men are pigs then you're pretty far off cause I'm a guy
---
Maybe if the game wasn't so god damn grindy I could play a build I actually enjoy
---
BHVRs focus on adding micro transactions and integrating the archive challenges are the first steps toward the death of this game. Instead of focusing on adding new modes or even a casual, unranked modes, they’ve added challenges that encourage people to throw games. And with the new terrible dc penalty system. I don’t see this game going much farther unless BHVR starts taking risks and doing new things with their game, instead of adding  a menial challenge system.
---
I hope you do genuinely consider going to therapy because you definitely seem like the type of person that beats/kills his wife for taking a penny out of your pockets without asking
---
 
---
and that's my last response :)
---
Exactly the 1 trail part ruins it all. 6 games into trying to do this challenge now. This one a Steve realises what I was doing and deliberately sat in the furthered corner of the map
---
You literally just called me stupid and wonder why people are toxic???   You can’t contradict yourself. I’m just being honest.  
---
I’m not RAGING. What did I say that was disrespectful and showed I was *mad*. Where is your thought process?  Don’t be rude to me just because YOU’RE raging over a GhostFace doing his challenge.   He’s probably having a hell of a time and finally asked for help. 
---
As a comment said, people have been saying it’s gonna die off soon. But it’s really not.  If you feel this way, uninstall the game and leaves this sub if you’re gonna bitch and whine. I’m sure we’ll all be okay.
---
A survivor DCing still keeps a killer occupied before DCing. Your point is an irrelevant red herring.
---
You do realise the only way to prevent escape is killing and the reason you patrol gens is to find survivors to kill? If all you did was patrol and kick gens you'd literally loose every game
---
I personally really like these. Even with the best tracking in the game it feels limited when everybody is at T2, and now you can solve that by just for example, going up to a generator with progress, and blasting your entire terror radius to instantly make them Madness 3 and get them into a chase. So long as you can still increase madness with shock therapy (and hopefully the hitreg gets fixed a bit) his already strong tracking just got a WHACK buff.
---
Also not having to switch stances is huge. Being able to zap and bap at the same time is something I only could've dreamed about.
---
If you Etsy these things, give me a reply. I would love to buy a set. They’re beautiful.
---
Lol is this a loss meme
---
As someone who doesnt play the game can someone explain this to me. I get the gist but what's a tunnler?
---
Yeah I hate playing against huntress. Went from my favourite killer to vs to least favourite
---
you just need to be on it when it completes, as was the 3 gen one.
---
&gt;killer mains are entitled  
---
This guy.  
---
Did you just start playing dbd?
---
I think your first part is a decent argument.
---
&gt;Also not having to switch stances is huge. Being able to zap and bap at the same time is something I only could've dreamed about.
---
But the point of my OP, is to ask, why? Why is bap and zapping at the same time such a big deal?
---
The rift isn't the tome dipshit.
---
absolute same here. By far my least favorite killer to play against currently because of servers.
---
Yes but you're running at 90% speed, which is incredibly slow. That's almost as slow as a clown bottle or dream snare, just by default on every killer. This is ridiculously killer favoured.
---
“Remember, no survivors.”
---
“Go all default customization on Dwight and free escapes are guaranteed.”
---
Dang he deleted his thread.  Lol
---
Thank you!!
---
omg yes ty for asking! it's @cute_c3 UwU I post updates there first~
---
I often get invited to parties while I play DBD (Xbox player btw), typically there'll be on asshole that talks shit about the killer, but starts complaining the moment they get hooked... I ignore these people in-game
---
She put 3 traps and camped a little away watching if anyone comes to unhook lol

Blast will be better than passive field depending almost entirely on charge time. Also if it affects downed survivors. 
---
We’ll have to see the nature of the changes but I think distressing+devour+thrill will be fucking brutal on doc if it’s a ~20 second cooldown.
---
^ ye that's the reference
---
Not everything needs to be completely accessible to the casual players who barely touch the game more than once a week. It’s ok to have things that require a bit of a grind
---
It generally just makes his gameplay significantly more fluid, what with no longer having to wait a full second to capitalise off a well aimed shock. Again, if the hitreg is fixed, that's fantastic.
---
It's worth noting though I'm still a BIT iffy on Static Blast as much as I praise it. I'm not a big fan of killers that have massive cooldowns on their power and are effectively an M1 machine for 60 seconds, that's why I like current Doctor since he can passively do his thing. I'll just have to see exactly how strong it is when it releases.
---
Noice
---
Good to know its just people being salty, im relatively new to playing this game and was questioning what my actual objective was because people were upset when I magically was able to kill them because they were doing this.
---
That’s, Uh, a little less than accurate. It takes A LOT of force to cut through muscle, spinal cord, organs, AND bone all in one swoop. Hell, even “heavy” swords like claymores would fail to do that. I doubt a Katana would even be capable of cutting that deep, especially with how fragile they actually were.
---
I'd say changing the passive is an okay change, by running whispers you can get exact coordinates easily, and can even potentially save that first scream on other survivors for later. we'll have to see how it impacts mid-late game. 
---
I'm not a good doctor but I noticed trying to zap, and hit I'd often do it just short, this could potentially be a decent buff as it makes hanging around pallets extra unsafe. 
---
I know exhaustion addons are unpopular, but I was kind of hoping they'd slightly buff Mindbreaker so it'd make a powerful niche build for lower tier killers like Doc/Clown/Huntress.
---
Wrong
---
Try Bubba. I got it on my 2nd game, it was close to getting done and you really need agitation rank 3.  
---
Also Insidious is your friend here. It sucks, but it’s a great perk for this challenge.
---
[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ebn240/memed_by_daylight_part_5/)  
---
What other perks would you like to see in this?
---
People are scared of challenge it seems. The challenges are easily done within 1-5 games.
---
In league doesn't it count as a DC if you just don't rejoin? That's not really and option in DbD
---
GOD FUCKING FORBID YOU RUN A BUILD SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS COMPLETING THE CHALLENGES.
---
RUN AGITATION AND SURVEILLANCE AND QUIT YOUR BITCHING.
---
I was like halfway through and saw your comment and went back up to read the start... Thanks for that lol. I don't know how I managed to miss that.
---
Idk only if you're injured would the slowdown take effect which tbh is what killers struggle with the most already other than stealth killers, nurse/spirit. I was just trying to think of a way to make the loops harder on survivors because even now they are pretty strong in general. I also feel like this is something that would be interesting to test out on the PTB because I think its something that sounds like alot but isnt that much. Like nurse nerf for example
---
Did expect the amount of willing people to consider fucking billy but that's okay
---
Honestly, whenever I play killer and someone is purposefully trying to get my attention, I just ignore them and go for the other teammates. Chances are if you're purposefully trying to get my attention, you are confident in your looping ability so I'll just save you for last
---
Honestly if the only problem I have with these is the survivor ones where I have to wait like 10min to get into the lobby
---
I think you misunderstand why battle passes are there, they encourage you to play more than once or twice a week. If you dont then your activity going against what its designed for and shouldn't complete it. People like me who play for a couple of hours every day / every other day will work to complete the battle pass and claim the rewards.
---
Just because there is a paid option doesnt mean it should be easy to complete.  I like that they are rough because of the sense of accomplishment for finishing them. If they were easy everyone who complete it and get the unlocks and then what's the point? It might aswell just be a cosmetic pack then?
---
They sound pretty reasonable. There are self-proclaimed killer mains on here echoing the same sentiments, so idk.
---
Ah sorry to say it was only a school project but I’m glad you like it :D
---
I doubt you’ll miss it. Any perk that exposes people plus distressing is gonna be stupid fucking strong on him. 
---
As long as he doesn’t get neutered by cooldown on blast, he’ll be in damn fine shape
---
I made the first post that mentioned the enabling of the Dc punishments:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eby6er/looks_like_dc_penalties_went_live/
---
This was over 24 hours ago. Since then I played a bunch of survivor and killer without using the Leave Game feature.
---
**Today my game freezed during laoding, I had to task manager it and when I opened it again, I was punished for 5 minutes, the first escalation after 60s.**
---
So, beware, if your game crashes multiple times while this test is still enabled you can be "banned" for [6 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ec05r0/disconnection_penalty_lengths_tested/) or more.
---
Would have been fine also "If they don't make DCs count"?
---
👁👄👁
---
Adam was clearly expecting you to repair the generators and open the gates.
---
Why create a thread if you’re just gonna trash talk everyone who has a different opinion than you?
---
Omg yes. I need this mod haha
---
Why are you even complaining? No one told you to kys
---
The challenges are still fuckin' dumb and need to be changed, *dipshit.*
---
I swear inner strength kills the survivor challenges so hard. People just run off for a locker so often.
---
I mean so is tea bagging after every pallet drop but you don't see people calling out those players.
---
You think either of those are exclusive to women? That's kinda funny.
---
Ah, ok. Sorry, I assumed the watermark was your Reddit account. I didn't see the traditional Instagram watermark. Ty very much! :) I look forward to your work. :D
---
Unsure on Medic  but got handyman the other day on ps4.
---
Bored of dumbass survivors running away to use self care so been trying to do the adept killer ones on console instead
---
People are evil, still is a necesarry evil.
---
I do not hate you really, I just not into that "Edgy" artstyle.
---
Still some of your memes are actually good 🐢🏸🏸🐢
---
I keep getting the unable to update survivor rank error mid game, now i got a 15 min wait time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All I've found so far about the issue is about 6 months ago that the devs are aware, now they implemented the DC punishment, but they are unable to differentiate between people rage quitting and getting kicked... 
---
Not sure if I should continue playing and risk longer waiting times, or wait for the devs to move from being aware of the issue to fixing it.
---
I'll give it a go. Trapper just aint working the last guy always knows not to mess with it and lets his team die
---
No stance switching is absolutely huge and well worth the trade off. No more moving at 110% or awkwardly switching midchase to get a shock. Just stun and hit. It makes it so much easier for doc to hit shocks on certain loops, some that weren't even possible before.
---
His tracking was very good, but I'd take new Doc in a heartbeat as someone who plays Doc the most out of all killers.
---
If you'd like the old tracking back, I think Whispers will be a very good option. Soon as you see it lit up use your AoE and you instantly find them. No need to even wait for them tier up. In that aspect, it's almost better because this works early and late game, as opposed to Doc's power going down in effectiveness late game.
---
Freddy can’t be bought with iri shards
---
Ahhh if that's the case then that's definitely possible. That's great news.
---
turns out the rift is just horribly designed. Who could have seen it coming?
---
It just feels so forced...this is the last game that NEEDS a battlepass and the worst type of game for a battlepass system. Battle passes are a good concept in F2P games that have no “grind” because gameplay content is unlocked automatically (aka battle royales like Fortnite and Apex). Gives you something to work for if you choose to.
---
Battle passes are NOT good in asymmetrical casual game with so much RNG and so many variables from match to match.
---
This game has an ungodly amount of monetization already and a ridiculous grind. The game is $20, theres numerous DLCs that lock perks and characters behind, theres a cosmetic store with multiple cosmetics every week....what do you need a battlepass for? Not to mention they put cosmetics for paid DLC characters in the rift so if you dont have that character then no reward for you.
---
You’re able to get to tier 70 with 2 hours of playtime a day apparently. Thats definitely not taking into account how queues can take 15 minutes, further exacerbated by lobby dodgers and teammates DCing when downed first and ebony mori killers etc. Its just such a waste of development time.
---
I agree with everything in this comic, but trying to stop the killer from hooking someone is part of the game because it's a large risk/reward. Though I imagine you're referencing someone standing directly in front of the hook and being a prick, in which case fuck em.
---
Also I haven't heard of the hook trick, is that where neither survivors take damage because the game has those odd invincibility frames right after someone gets unhooked?
---
I wish they would fix the game breaking bugs first. There is still that bug that makes it so the killer can't pick you up and the endgame collapse doesn't end and no bleedout. The only way to end is to have adren and have the killer close hatch or dc. Now it's gonna be a waiting game on who is willing to dc and take the punishment first.
---
That works too!
---
They really aren't easily done within 1-5 games.  
---
Complete 4 generators in a single trial using Dark Sense.  
---
Ah yes, this requires you to practically be the only one doing gens for an entire trial, which is in no way viable.  
---
Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement in a single trial.  
---
The second you sacrifice one in the basement, 1-2 survivors DC to stop you from getting progress. (happens more often than you'd expect)  
---
Luckily a lot of the killer challenges can be completed easily if you get the survivors to farm with you, but you wont be getting 4 pallet stuns on a killer in a regular game at best you'll get one then the killer will respect pallets the rest of the game denying you progress.
---
Also there are some typos here, sorry!

🕯️👁️🕯️
---
No, I’m both red rank killer and survivor and gen rushing makes the game boring and shitty.
---
Because their opinions are shit? Has everybody forgotten what "fun" is?  Does anybody even fucking remember? Because that's what games are supposed to be. These challenges aren't fun, they're obnoxious and stupid and retarded, and those who can't see that are just thick.
---
Thanks, for the help
---
I'm struggling to find any decent games, and even the games that look okay, someone will dc. On occasions I've seen people go to the basement and afk or even just groups of people dcing at once. I mean really
---
no its not? different killers have different lunge ranges, and his is long and has a disjointed hitbox.
---
I bait you into chasing me cause I want you to so team can do gens it does not matter if I get camped and die my mission was complete
---
It's crazy to me. Like, I get it, no one likes getting tunnelled and the answer isn't always, "Just loop the killer."
---
But there are so many instances where the survivor goes through some weird mental gymnastics. Like, calling the killer a tunneller when they got the 4K, even more so when no gens are done.
---
Fair, it could still be tunnelling but I feel the idea of "Tunnelling" is usually to the killer's detriment.
---
I see 2 batmans kissing
---
dw the 30 second DC penalty will solve all your issues. Glad to see them consistently spending their time on unnecessary BS.
---
So the other option is to...what? Give up the kill? A 2k can at least get you a brutal killer if you played the game right. Just securing that 2nd kill rather than leaving and MAYBE getting some one else down just isn't worth it some times. Especially if you feel the survivors are just better than you
---
No oni is very trash
---
&gt;In league doesn't it count as a DC if you just don't rejoin?
---
If it takes more than like 2 minutes (A team can surrender should one of their allies not connect at 3 minutes) between you disconnecting and you rejoining it counts as a DC and you get the Leaver Buster (Queue Ban). My game crashed often on during the loading screen and that caused me to not connect to like 1/15 games and would get me leaver buster.
---
At least suicide on hook isn't punishable. I know I'ma get downvoted for this but I refuse to just sit there when I'm getting facecamped. I get that I disbenefit my team by suiciding but I also have a very small window of time to play games every day so I can't waste time being facecamped, slugged, etc
---
The timer decay is exponential. From what I know it's roughly 36 hours(?), and then it ramps down in intensity
---
&gt;No stance switching is absolutely huge and well worth the trade off. No more moving at 110% or awkwardly switching midchase to get a shock. Just stun and hit. It makes it so much easier for doc to hit shocks on certain loops, some that weren't even possible before.
---
Does it help counter looping at all. Or is it just a time saver?
---
You're joking right? You really think someone instantly quitting and not leaving a body that needs to be carried and hooked keeps a killer occupied as much as someone who stays in the match? 
---
&gt;Your point is an irrelevant red herring.
---
Projecting much? Trying to argue and be pedantic about carry + hook times when that wasn't even what I was initially saying is more of a red herring than anything I've posted.
---
To recap, all I said was that even in a worst-case scenario, people will still ruin games in the same amount of time as they do currently. What will most likely happen is people will at least attempt to play for a little bit, and even if they rage quit they permanently destroy a hook.
---
It will make everything better for everyone in the long run.
---
I honestly think it's a bit of a mixed bag.  Chat can be quite distracting, and they sometimes point out nonsense.
---
There's a reason many (but not all) of the best players in non-esports titles tend to be streamers - they are the only ones who make a living playing the game.  It's a bit of a rich get richer situation.
---
Umm, mocking survivors who needlessly tbag is something we do alot on this sub.
---
The DCing epidemic is terrible. I always have more fun playing with friends if they are online. (If you ever want to play I play on console)
---
No worries, I'm very excited about the changes and I believe it's really going to elevate Doctor.
---
Yes. If you complete it, you get what you spent refunded in Auric Cells. Worth to complete always haha.
---
Yeah i understand, but ill just leave it to someone who would appreciate it more than me
---
It’s still an unnecessary punishment for the devs doing a shitty job with this game
---
For context, it was a endgame scenario, and I decided to down a recently unhooked survivor. I knew he had DS.
---
Im sure there is some way so that only friends can message you.
---
Man don't be telling the secret to success or we won't have 3 heals a game!
---
i got this game a while ago but havent really played it. this sub makes me not want to at all, seems like everyone just complains about how everyone else plays
---
Yeah, but should I really have to do this?
---
We really can't say without a player count on console. The game was free for PS4 plus players and it's free if you have Xbox game pass so I'm sure the console side of the game has tons of players.
---
🕯️👁️🕯️✋
---
vibe check
---
You could also just ignore them.
---
Wtf
---
Turn messages from randos off
---
Or
---
Just act oblivious by saying "No I wasnt/No I'm not" and if they reply just say "No i didnt" (Or something similar). Its fast to type out and disregard whatever they said.
---
Most satisfying clip I’ve ever seen. I bet it sucks to be this asshole Billy. Congrats on the amazing escape &lt;3
---
Fly on the wall is surveillance but lower
---
G) Freddy gets nerfed.
---
Toxic
---
It's an insane amount. 10% means an unblinking Nurse can move faster than a survivor, that's how significant that slowdown is. The slower movement speed alone is broken, the rest is just gravy.
---
Honestly the perks look like the worse version of already existing perks and you didn't speak about the power, but I think it could come out something interesting
---
Oh yeah, you're right. I don't use the wards on survivors much.
---
The challenges are shit. Bloodpoints has always been important since the grind is so large.
---
Lore....eh theres no reason why we couldn’t have both.
---
it's like I'm watching something from /r/arabfunny
---
Yes
---
As someone who doesn’t know the game too well besides watching some vids occasionally, can someone explain what being a “tunneler” is?
---
How does it not occur to them that some necessary actions can conflict with one another. That cost you the match and is very unfair.
---
No avoiding unfortunately,  unless you turn chat off.  Not responding is totally valid, too.
---
Send salt and trash can emojis, watch them flame you, report, watch message get removed and they get banned. Ez.
---
I just realized I asked the question two different ways lol. You mean he can see you?
---
farming the rift is fair game in my book. Some of those quest would take hours to complete on normal matches.
---
That explains so much!
---
The person with OoO can't see you and you can see them.
---
Thank you
---
DBD developers sure have a type when it comes to women
---
That's rough, I wish it just hid both aura's but c'est la vie
---
Survivor adepts are too easy. /s
---
as a pc feng im sorry to hear my brethren have treated you as such. punish them.
---
Play with Your Food could be a factor, but it's inconsistent on Trapper since it has to be stacked up *and* every hit will use up a stack.
---
If I am really annoyed at the way a killer played and I need to vent, I always try to open with a statement like 'I understand there are no rules saying how anyone has to play the game BUT we had a dc at the start of the game and you didn't need to tease me with the hatch only to close it at the last moment'
---
Adding that little part at the start actually works really well, I have gotten polite responses the few times I felt the need to say something post game.
---
survivors like this make me not care about using noed
---
Oh I thought if you had trap you died going through exit gate! Last time I played prior to recently was like... just post-Spirit?
---
Back to my original comment though, wouldn't Deep Wound on the last survivor be fairly similar to being Chainsawed or Demon Raged or NOED or any of those 1 shots when you're the last survivor? Except with this you sort of have a chance to get back if you find a med-kit or get through the gate in time?
---
Well if you think about it why should an injured survivor beable to run full speed? I mean they are hurt after all. Honestly I don't think it would affect good survivors much at all. Considering they still have up to 8 ways to get away from the killer even at less movement speed.
---
Me and the boys vibing
---
I completely forgot there was a stream today. My bad.
---
I’m nothing special as a survivor highest I’ve been is rank 6 but without spending countless hours in the game it’s ridiculously hard to get to red ranks especially with disconnects every match and players that literally do the bare minimum just to escape be hiding in the corner til hatch spawns.
---
That's pretty cool, but only one really?
---
Aaaaand this is why people are furious why with penalty system.
---
I could play this game a few hours on a saturday and a few hours on a sunday. I’m guaranteed to get the infinite load screen at least once each day. Thats avoiding any other gamebreaking issue. Say someone wanted to play the game alot a few days in a row you could easily get that hour ban through no fault of your own.
---
This will probably effect streamers most, which is good because maybe then the devs will pull their head out of their ass and realize their game is in no fit state to have a penalty system this severe.
---
Teabagging body locking flashlight spamming... Yep they're prime candidate for the tunnel treatment. The filth must be discarded at all costs.
---
BHVR is promoting farming. The challenges shouldn't be one trial but like instead of 4 sacrifices in the basement in one game why not 25 sacrifices in the basement across various games? Same for some survivor challenges.
---
Salty killers will say camping is a legit strat then turn around and call using a flashlight toxic.
---
Sorry you're bad lol.
---
It’s not the kills, it’s the amount of times hooked. That’s why them escaping does nothing to your pip chances but you could potentially get an extra hook to get irridescent.
---
They already swore and threw it out, I reported and he said nothing but communication bans. It should be a 24 hour ban, honestly.
---
The only question is which Linkin Park song they'll choose
---
Wow, why didnt i think of that. Dont be toxic STOP YOUR BITCHING isnt how shit gets fixed ypu fucking idiot.
---
I only prestige my killers or survivors of the first 50 levels of perks were awful even then I make sure to use everything good to have a decent amount of points towards the prestige. If I manage to get bbq and chili 2 or 3 within a prestige I stop there.
---
Perks could definitely be a lot stronger, but I like the concept of them
---
The art style reminds me of TF2, I love it
---
Lol you are not getting all 4 if gates are open unless u have noed or a one hit killer and get super lucky plays. Countless times I have moved away to not be an asshole just to have all 4 escape body blocking bt etc, depending on how the game went taking that super small chance leaving is just out right stupidity and illogical and they are still playing the game they are securing their only kill just cause they aren't taking that super slim chance of getting another person when gates are open doesn't qualify as them not playing.If anything most of the time if u did get someone else after leaving they just trade places, you have a better chance at getting a second person being cocky trying to get the save. I've gone from a 1k to 4k by stupid bold plays and I have gotten no one countless times leaving the hook with doors open just to not feel like a camping asshole and then I regret leaving.
---
Kindred, even the non-buffed form, would still be too good to be base-kit. There's so much information it conveys that it changes completely changes the efficiency and randomness of the game.
---
There are times where I'm half a map away, without Kindred, and decide that I'm decently close and should go get the unhook. Only to realize that the whole team is there.
---
Now, with Kindred, same distance, but now I can see that the others are closer and I can keep working away at my gen without needing to go for the save.
---
It would take away from the random variables of the game that could be way worse for the Killer, but only just a bit.
---
Higher ranks won't  have much of this because of the experience they've gained and judgements they make, but the potential for variable actions still exist.
---
Giving solo's boons compared to SWF wouldn't be a good change for the game, but to be fair the only change in the way of a boon for solo's that I could get behind is to let the two or more Survivors working on a gen repair it at regular speed instead of debuffing the speed to compensate for multiple Survivors working on it.
---
Dude, anyone could play all day killer and be "nice" to the survivors but you will still get messaged toxic messages because you got one or two kills, or if u lose youll get the good old " gg ez baby killer" you cant avoid toxicity in dbd the community is trash
---
"DUR HUR yOu cANT dC oN LoAdiNg ScReEn"

YOU ARE A SAD LITTLE CHILD WITHOUT CAPITAL LETTERS.

YOU AREN’T TRYING TO GET ANYTHING FIXED, YOU’RE JUST BITCHING. GOD FORBID YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TRY TO COMPLETE THE TIER 4 CHALLENGES.
---
QUIT YOUR BITCHING, BITCH.
---
I always thought if jason was in the game he would have some sort of rage ability, that builds up slowly over time getting boosts whenever he loses a chase or gets stunned by flashlights, Ds, etc
---
Before gaining the ability to walk through pallets for a short time, similar to f13 game.
---
I was worried about making them too overpowered, I'll see what I can do to make them stronger though!
---
saw my name in the tilte
---
I just yeet if I get hooked and go to the next games
---
Yea yesterday I hooked 2 in the basement and the other two sprinted straight to me before I was even away from the basement shack. I had stbfl so I was slashing pretty quick, and managed to get everyone injured.they were all claudettes so I couldn’t tell who was who, and everyone was injured. I just started downing people as they were all running for it and 1 dced, while I killed the other. They both start spamming me for the rest of the game calling me a trash tunneled who proxy camps. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT FROM ME
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT. SO MANY PEOPLE DC IN THIS FUCKING GAME. STOP BEING A SALTY FUCKING BITCH AND TAKE THE L! CAN'T GET THESE FUCKING ADEPT TROPHIES CUZ THAT SHIT.
---
You're 100% right but I can hold out hope that maybe one day it'll change even tho we all know it never will
---
Thanks for proving my point
---
I mean another thread brought this up... but now that this is coming to light... perhaps a killer have pets? Horrid pigs mutated by the entity to track down her victims... Now that would be scary.
---
I already sew the news headliners: "Guy kills an entire family using a weapon buyed from a game"
---
"The justice is fighting to ban the game from all the stores"
---
why wouldn't it?
---
That's the kind of feedback I like. When I was learning pre patch spirit, people were actually nice when they saw I had one perk. Getting tips from others is great, when they are courteous about it. When i learned how to play her and started getting consistent 3ks, the salt was there. It always baffles me.
---
Shoot I'm not super knowledgeable about all the other perks. I'll see how I could revise them a bit a post again in a few days
---
He's too sexy for this hook
---
I mean by that logic, they shouldn't be able to move at all after being hooked the first time. This game isn't exactly big on realism.
---
There's no way you play at red ranks if you think this isn't a big deal. 
---
Try an experiment, try looping survivors as Trapper with no traps. Then do it as Hag with no traps. Then come back and tell me how little a difference 10% movement speed makes. Remember there's only 5% difference between those two.
---
G) Pig nerfed
---
I was hoping it hid both auras. Thanks a lot True Talent
---
Basically.
---
It’s so satisfying getting them comm banned. If it happens enough it will be permanent, or they’ll learn their lesson about hate mail.
---
Streetwise is a great perk, I’m glad people are finally realizing it. Making generators only need 60 charges to repair instead of 80 really adds up when you do the math, and stacking it with botany and a Medkit can be hilarious too.
---
Lol this guy is just way to highly opinionated like the way he plays killer is the way everyone has to play.
---
Not to mention that the mere existence of OoO instill preference towards the stealth killers, so SWF's with OoO automatically gain a huge advantage over non-stealth killers. I can't say anything about PC, but on console I swear the red ranks are filled with GF mains, but of course that's not the only reason stealth killers are used so much.
---
Goodbye, DCer. We definitely won't miss you!
---
YUP... they wouldn’t be half as bad to complete if the matchmaking times weren’t such shit
---
I got it eventually as Basement Demo, but it wasn't exactly fun and I had to sweat.
---
Whats so bad about Sprint burst? I'm not really into the meta but from what I read on the description it's kinda trash
---
Your literally said "So? This is about an individual experience. This isn’t a competitive game dude."
---
I don't see how i missed the point, but you did edit it saying "not what i can do for the team" which makes my point even more that your just a trash survivor who leaves when he doesn't get his way though.
---
Understandable, but I actually prefer solos because of the random aspect of the game, so I suppose I do somewhat have some bias towards that.
---
It's all just based on experiences I guess.
---
YOU DON’T HAVE A POINT. YOU JUST HAVE COMPLAINTS AND BITCHING.
---
QUIT YOUR BITCHING. AND GET SOME CAPITAL LETTERS!
---
All good bud.
---
Cause they’re fucking regarded that’s why. Didn’t they learn from tome 3
---
This game is actual fucking dogshit. Fuck you devs fux this laggy ass game
---
Hey are you that person I sometimes play with that drops her hot pockets?
---
I think some of you guys call survivors toxic for everything sheesh lol. Sometimes I try to get killer attention to save a mate he happen to see that was injured and isnt as good at chases as me. So if I take the burden then we keep a mate who can go heal up and perhaps potentially help out the manpower on generators.
---
To get the killers attention YES I have to tbag a bit or click my flashlight. Good lord. 2 seconds of this behavior warrants an angry killer telling you you deserve to die IF YOU GET CAUGHT because you were...wait for it...TOXIC. 😑

I main her too lol. The inability to instantly double blink twice in a row is huge.
---
Imagine doing this challenge without dc left and right.
---
The rift is fucking stupid because nobody cares about escaping anymore, They only care about doing their challenge and fuck the rest of the team. I've never seen so many dcs and hook suicides until this shit came out. I'm frustrated because instead of making challenges that push you to be a better survivor or killer, they encourage the player base to play like cancer.
---
Nothing triggers me more in this game than watching a survivor run a marathon before they'll let me heal them. I've stopped bothering if they run further then around the corner I'm not wasting the time trying to heal them.
---
sure but then dont complain postgame when your tactic worked?
---
Well camping pretty helpful really, if one guys being camped it’s polite to stay on the hook and the other 3 just do gens.
---
I mean it’s up to the guy on the hook really but it leads to an easy win for 1 sacrifice.
---
The others I dunno tho 🤷‍♂️
---
No, it's not using one of the three arabfunny-approved meme songs
---
Oh look, another example of the horrible community🙄
---
Honestly I'm ok with farming whenever, I know some people get sick of it but, if people want to farm, I'll farm
---
Yes it dose not fit the current game state
---
FINISH 4 Gens. I think it means you have to be the gen jocky
---
Thanks!
---
When did it come out for mobile? I thought it wasn't till next year?
---
Finally holy shit we needed this
---
Yeah farmings fine but the only challenge that’s actually difficult is kill everyone in the basement and I don’t think any survivors would do that
---
That's why this is a test for a small time.
---
After which, it will be switched off, while they use the information gained from this test to learn how to tell the difference between a "leave match", or a connection drop/steam goes down, etc.
---
We should all try different types of Disconnect to give them a good chance to get it right the first time. In moderation.
---
yes so deliverance will actually work when i haven’t been hooked all game
---
All that keyboard clicking is annoying
---
"The Shape enjoys staring contests over pallets. Don't be the first to blink!"
---
Not sarcastic, but
---
"Boop the snoot."
---
downvote time
---
Honesty I'd go BBQ. I think it's much stronger than Bamboozle on most if not all killers and the bp gains are phenomenal for helping you level your killers.
---
What if they made ranked and casual or would that just increase wait times
---
Fuck, my b!
---
They perch on top of the locker and then circle when you leave the locker.
---
Tons of things in this game are broken and the community supports this model of buying new content over and over again while the game is persistently buggy and frustrating to play.
---
I definitely won't miss someone who DC's, seeya.
---
Nah, its not, i still find her strong as fuck (and i dont think she needs a nerf, just the omegablink)
---
The first time I played I did the same thing. I still get lost in maps. It's fun though and sometimes I'll still get scared😂
---
Power is really bad.  Breaking a pallet is almost guaranteed to end a chase, and you have to chase some one for a whole minute to insta down.  Fun idea, but would not be good for a serious match.
---
definitely go bbq! its good on all killers and the bonus bp is v helpful.
---
BBQ to get points to get everything faster
---
BBQ. Bamboozle is almost meme tier as far as perks go.
---
bruh-
---
Well it's the devs fault for making challenges that promote unfun playstyles.
---
I've seen killers slug everyone indefinitely because they don't want to get flashlight stunned, even though that's a survivor challenge. Or they overly respect pallets which is also another challenge. Not to mention that most killers running basement builds end up just camping the basement to ensure that they get their challenge done, there's 4 basement related challenges in these tomes collectively and that's all I've seen killers do with them.
---
Or seeing survivors throw down every pallet just to get that challenge done, or how the devs thought it was a good idea to simultaneously have a heal yourself challenge and heal others challenge, so survivors actively had to fight with each other on getting heals.
---
I'm not condoning DCing, but idk what the devs expect  out of these challenges when this is the playstyle they're basically promoting.
---
I once spawned outside the gates and escaped as soon as the game started
---
So what does the killer do when the exit gates are 99'd? Asking for survivor advice what to do when someone is hooked and the exit gates are far away.
---
"Designated juker" is wholly reliant on the killer taking the bait, though. If the killer doesn't take the bait then every survivor better know how to run a loop. 
---
At the same time, you can certainly make the bait more tempting by running Object of Obsession and going clicky clicky, but at that point you're effectively restricting the conversation to being about pre-made SWFs, and pre-made SWFs are something of a minority in the game.

aight bye
---
Recently had someone who was doing everything they could to make me chase them. 
---
Eventually got tired of it and downed them and they died on the hook. They messaged me to say I tunneled them, and I said that they clearly wanted my attention, which they then got. He agreed.
---
Gonna have to play him to find out. Doc was my first main and I think one of his biggest weaknesses is that Madness is kind of worthless without add ons. This isn’t changing with the rework but he is getting some nice buffs so we’ll have to wait to see how he plays.
---
I could make that for $16. Just buy a Hatchet at Walmart and borrow my brother's wood burning kit

There is one map I absolutely despise for both sides and it's Rotten Fields. It's the most boring map in the game, I wouldn't be mad if they just deleted it.
---
What killer do you main? Or do u prefer?
---
It was a clenched buttocks game. Demogorgon. The ending was the only clench  part tho. Otherwise I think I rip-off 360 pretty well. So Demo hit me while carrying Nea. I used my pharmacy then and healed myself up in a tiny patch of bamboo. He looked all around for me. Except there.  Saved Nea, looped Demo again, Nea hooked again. So I wanted some altruism before I died so I saved Nea while Demo was on me. Demo Lovato downed, hooked me. I don’t have borrowed time, so she also died. Other Nea saved me while Demo was looking in my general area. I bolted and lag switched all over Nea. Demo also had remember me which took too long. As I was booting the 20 meters to the gate, I was so scared he was gon use lunge. He didn’t tho. At the end I got sandbagged by Nea like let me tf out get out my waaaay. We both survived, first Nea ded Nea

There's a beta out in a few countries, but apparently it isn't too difficult to spoof your country ID to download it.
---
isnt the bubba like the huntress? as in insidious doesnt really work for him due to his chainsaw constantly going?
---
Hillbilly is trash on most Farm maps, no room for curving and loops are too safe to get a chainsaw on them.
---
Good example of average survive with friends
---
"HOLY FUCK HE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME?"
---
Where are you?

"BY THE GEN I WAS ON"

*annoyed spongebob face*
---
Ok, but is it through their website? Only reason is i cant find it on Google playstore. Im in usa btw
---
You know if the generators were actually difficult to complete, I would be okay with considering Adrenaline to be a reward, but how often do you see a survivor with Sprint Burst create an enormous distance, get chased to a safe pallet, force the killer to break it, stall them at an unsafe pallet, take a hit, make it to a safe pallet, and etc?
---
Chase mechanics aren't in favor of most killers, and the few that have decent chase-enders still end up low unless they have stunning map mobility (Freddy for example) or are literally invisible during the chase (Spirit) or are Hillbilly.
---
Generators are, quite frankly, easy to power through because the ability of any halfway decent survivor to stall the killer is greater than the killer's ability to pressure the map; one-on-one a killer will always overpower a survivor unless they are Noob3-tier amazing, but four-on-one most killers can't expect to stop all 5 gens.
---
Additionally the game is *designed* for all 5 generators to pop, BHVR's optimal kill rate is *two survivors*; meaning the other two have to escape through an exit gate.
---
Say that with me.
---
"The game is designed to ensure that in every average balanced game, the survivors complete all 5 generators because 2 survivors are supposed to escape through an exit gate."
---
This means that Adrenaline doesn't require some kind of hurdle, it's baked into the design of the game to activate - the only times you don't get Adrenaline are when you underperformed as a group.
---
Similarly killers aren't meant to successfully keep all 5 generators from popping, NOED isn't a "reward for failing"; all 5 generators popping is not a failure, but a purpose of the game design and balance.
---
Temple isn;t actually that bad. For survivor it has lot of nice loops, for killer you should defend the gens around the temple and just ignore the rest.
---
A house version of the tiles for every map would work, but also be work.
---
Because they feel good off of it but 9.9/10 I just ignore them as nothing is gained by responding with anything else than a report to psn
---
There’s literally a challenge for sacrificing all 4 survivors in the basement in a single trial. People are gonna do what they need to do for them to complete the challenge. Just get over it &amp; move on. It’s not that serious.
---
Any advice on how to play Demogorgon, and recommended perks?
---
Do we have the option to mute it?
---
If you care about getting them done just try to farm. Very easy to knock out the "harder" killer ones by farming. Bit harder to do for the survivor challenges obviously.
---
Pretty lame how they still think it's acceptable to have challenges that encourage farming or playing like an asshole in the case of the Insidious Bubba, I mean basement challenge.
---
I want the [Barney Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II71tmVsKrE) opening theme as my chase music.  How do?
---
Puke on them until they are broken then hit them and hook them, if they cleanse go get the corrupt purge and win and puke on everything you can
---
Yeah, only reason I got this one was because I played SWF with some relatively new friends and matchmaking still somehow fucked up (surprise) and gave us a rank 20 killer.
---
Oh dear, it seems you’ve seen it
---
Can’t wait to throw it at a tree then it somehow hit my friend irl cause hatchet hit boxes r broken
---
It’s mostly for the “official” one resale value is gonna go up
---
Adorable. All hail the Dwermet!
---
I run dying light, thana, ruin, and monitor. This good?
---
They sure as hell didn't get it. I'll dc everytime 🍆
---
Really? Noed isn't a reward for failing? A killer could perform absolutely awful and get kills because of that, and it isn't even a one time thing. Sorry but disagree with that point.
---
No matter what killer your playing you're supposed to apply gen pressure, if you're gonna tunnel one survivor the whole game and then complain about how op gen rushing is and adrenaline is it's your own damn fault.
---
Actually at the very state of the clip, they power the last generator, none of them have even managed to reach/start opening the gates yet (and the killer would know that even if one of them was camping the switch, it'll still take 20 seconds to open).
---
Also this is The Game, where the switches are set on opposite sides of a level that Hillbilly can (mostly) sprint through unless he got the worst RNG known to man (and even then there's usually at least one decent path from side to side) to interrupt either gate.
---
He easily could have patrolled the gates and gotten someone, even if David was unhooked as a result, usually I would camp the hook too, but it all changes if you have mobility and an instant-down.
---
Heck even someone like a 99% EW3 Myers isn't going to want to camp, but draw people to the unhook to hopefully down two, and he's way slower than Hillbilly sprinting.
---
That’s... not how it works.
---
Just wait till your friend dcs cause he was Insta downed...
---
Ah.
---
These changes sound awful. Increase mend timer, sloppy butcher and two blade addons. I'm sure survivors will be ecstatic to hold m1 for the rest of eternity.
---
This whole game is just survivors bitching about how killers aren't nice to them, it's fucking hilarious.
---
JK, I wont take hate out on survivros, there are many cool and fun players, and I belileve both sides have toxic players, so I dislike how you are being mad at only one side. &gt;:(
---
Right now? Oni but generally Freddy/ghostface
---
Lmao good riddance.
---
Yea but even then u have to be lucky enough to walk up to one that’s almost completed which is harder than you’d think, and the basement one the survivors just run away and stay on the other side of the map even iron grasp can only do so much
---
That’s good thana is great for her especially in higher ranks no one will want to cleanse
---
OMg, close XDDD
---
Sure, but that’s a perk. Any killer can have it, and Jason wouldn’t have to be using the perk at all times.
---
Thanks. I don’t think the developers know of this problem.. it’s just weird that no one has mentioned this
---
I'm beyond disappointed in how they are handling events now. An online multiplayer game having no events is just a slap when in the past we had experimental extra objectives with special generators, oozing flowers, lanterns! Cosmetics on the maps and lobby screen making it feel special. It was a breath of fresh air to the game. 
---
Now its all about the Rift. It feels so lazy and impersonal. Dead by daylight has grown so much but the more it grows the less it feels like it cares which may be an unpopular opinion since they keep trying to balance the game but that's just how I feel.
---
You seem to be missing MY point. It's not a double standard if both sides have the option to do so. In which case the video shows that specific example. I'm not advocating that either party should do it. Neither should be, but they do it anyway. But if someone does they have free rein to do what they want. You get that salt and defending of toxic play from both sides! I've seen it happen multiple times on both sides! That's why I say it's not a double standard. It's just a standard that nobody really likes. And before you go calling me a survivor cry baby, I'm a killer main. I have well over 600 hours in this game and 90% of it has been on killer. I know the whole survivor main toxicity thing happens, believe me. I've had to many gg ez killer, along with death threats because I killed them to count. But, your whole thing seems to be that all survivors are just douchbags and have no remorse and just teabag every game. I can say it happens often but not every game. I agree we need to not be toxic in our game play and hold yourself to a higher standard. But that's not gonna happen in the real world. People are always gonna be hateful to one another no matter what. All we can do is savor the good moments that do happen and try to forget about the bad ones. You have some obvious issues with survivors that you really need to deal with man. I want both sides to be great but it's an impossible task due to the human element. Just try not to be so negative and try to spread some positivity. Merry Christmas.
---
Have you BEEN on this subreddit before? That's exactly what you see.
---
1. That what this thread is about
---
2. My point is your toxic
---
Killers who hit people on hook are the worst because they are also campers most of the time
---
If you don’t know how to use self-care when equipped, you just tap the perk icon to begin healing yourself. Level 40 will only allow you to randomly get self care on other characters but claudette always has it.
---
Trying to get it by bringing Bloody Party Streamers. Cause people aren't going to DC in a match with Bloody Party Streamers right?
---
Right?
---
Yeah can you buy those in iridescent?
---
I’d definitely have to say [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
You can dislike it all you want but that’s exactly what it is, I had 4 killers quit today because we destroyed their hex totem. Killers are just as toxic if not more so. Seems like killers are on some sort of power trip and when they don’t get their way they throw a fit or post about it on reddit
---
Nope, Insidious Bubba is quite infamous for a reason. He is completely silent.
---
They're also the worst cause when they hit the person another survivor can get an easy unhook
---
Back in the day when almost every killer had a cooldown, oni is a nostalgia trip
---
My god, this is the best X,D
---
Could be then again queue times in this game are random as hell. Sometimes on console I get put into a game within 30 seconds sometimes it takes ages. I use to play on PC back in the day (sadly switched to Xbox cause my friends refuse to get a PC) and experienced the same thing.
---
HA jokes on you. I listen to that all the time! It's not a troll if you enjoy it!
---
No, would give an advantage
---
Yeah it was like that with the earlier dark sense challenge. Even if you literally tap the generator the second it’s fixed it will count towards the challenge.
---
Bring bond!
---
Then make the case for hag with Ruin
---
"You wanna smack me around a little?"
---
"As long as you're willing to wiggle ;]"
---
I know right? How are you even going to do that? Even the most brain dead survivors stepping traps will still see someone running too far to take back to the basement.
---
And setting up something like that is going to get you gen rushed to hell and back anyway, at best you can hope for a 3-gen near the basement and to get absurdly lucky with survivors running towards it rather than away, but who is going to do that with this challenge up, or ever? And an entire team doing that?
---
There is Basement Bubba, I advise people to start running Kindred since we're definitely gonna see basement campers.
---
it's basically camping to target an unhooker?
---
Theyd rather self care in the corner against Sloppy Butcher + Thanataphobia
---
That's the build I've been using. It's worked pretty well so far.
---
Especially if the gate is open and they are running decisive strike and deliverance. That's a free win for them. Unfortunately they die on hook.
---
Yes hes really fun
---
I would HIGHLY recommend you check out Fungoose on Twitch. He absolutely adores Plague and has won 114 games in a row as her. Without Ruin. That’s right, 114 consecutive 4k’s without Ruin at the red ranks
---
He uses Discordance, Corrupt Intervention, Pop, and Infectious Fright
---
I think you mean splinters
---
Forgot to mention I’m colorblind to the color red/orange I struggle to pick up scratch marks even if they are fresh I can’t see them well if it all
---
Oh and the Nea was hooked after 2 Survivors were already dead because Nea wasn't doing gens while the other person was being chased.
---
I have through a combination of self care, botany, D strike, and the Doctor.
---
I see that you like MY artwork with my dog It's not so good to take someone else's work 
---
 [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1565832700](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1565832700)
---
Sacrificing all four survivors in the basement should definitely be changed to something else, hooking them in the basement maybe? Survivors already avoid the basement like the death sentence it is if the killer decides to proxy or actually camp, it's ridiculous that survivors just have to escape with a specific skin that doesn't impact their perks, and killers have to bring survivors to the most avoided section on the map and kill all four of them there.
---
Yeah all of those are very good killers for gen pressure, I main ghost face primarily due to his ability of stealth. When playing him I suggest not using the stalk ability it wastes time and etc. instead use your no heartbeat to get close to people to insure a first hit before they can even get to a pallet. From their if the survivor gets to a strong loop and you know it will be a waste of time go on to your next survivor. The more people you have injured the more time they are healing and after a while they are gonna give up on healing since they want to get gens done and that’s when ghostface is very strong. This is especially good with sloppy, thanataphobia, and nurses cause it’s a huge time waster. Most importantly don’t get caught up on one survivor it’s a 1v4 not a 1v1 and too long a chase could really destroy the game since gen speeds r so fast.
---
Realistically, this wouldn’t be possible due to the Lawsuit F13 is facing right now. Great Concept though!
---
DotA2 easily.
---
Dammit Kyle....
---
Even if they added in a slight buffer for colorblind assists it would be great
---
Play a different game?...grab a coke?...anything but DC...anything...
---
Why not? It takes a ton of bps to max a character or even just to p3 them
---
Whaaat there are a lot of cat memes
---
I’m definitely not a fan of that way of play. I’m level 61 on the rift, unless it’s right at the beginning of the archives, I’m going to skip it and not look back. I could care less about the history of the trapper and Claudette. I’d rather just have the gear in the end to show I put up with the grind.
---
Lore will always be available to unlock. You can still do the challenges, and you’ll get the lore and bloodpoints, just no rift shards
---
Weren't Katanas used to slice samurais in half?
---
Update. Over 3 hours into the challenge at yet to get it. Had 3dc’s on shoulder to last hook
---
Nailed the expression.
---
No way he is getting out if this was PC, maybe at like rank 20. Still a good clip though.
---
How old is this video, no end game collapse?
---
The worst part is as soon as the second gen pops at least one survivor disconnects.
---
For everybody asking, yes this is an old clip. I took it about a year ago or more.
---
&gt; You seem to be missing MY point.
---
Oh the irony...
---
&gt; It's not a double standard if both sides have the option to do so
---
I want you to go back to my comment and give the specific statement where I declared that both sides don't have the option to BM. Next, I want you to explain how that specific statement is referencing the double standard.
---
Until then, you're little more than a bad troll who can't get past the strawman.
---
You realize there's so many obstacles in your way that can happen of they get a unhook? Borrowed time, Ds, body blocking, flashlight saves, pallet stuns, the list goes on. And if you're giving the room to unhook, your also giving them room to get way! And you're still camping!
---
I feel like I have heard this some time from BHVR. Brown buffs the killer slightly, yellow is moderately, green is considerably and purple is tremendously and sometimes changes ability. And pink addons change the killers ability slightly
---
I’ve heard of that! It’s on my list of places I’m going to inquire about an apprenticeship, but a bit farther away than some others. Any commute for my dream, though!
---
Still cant be everywhere at once when two get done simultaneously
---
Is there a way to avoid that, like changing lockers?
---
Cause I think I saw someone doing it in one of my games and I dont remember seeing any crows
---
Same experience over here. As soon as someone DC's like that I immediately DC to prevent the last guy getting hatch.
---
MATCHMAKING CAN SUCK MY DICK.   RANK 10/9, YET ALL I EVER SEE IS RED RANK TEAMS WITH AN OCCASIONAL PURPLE.  HAVEN'T SEEN A GREEN RANK NEAR MINE IN WEEKS.
---
I think you've forgotten that the killers have all been mentally broken and/or brainwashed into submission by the entity. They are beyond help.
---
I like playing low rank because personally I have more fun playing the game, chasing people, letting the survivors slip away now and then, and not even focusing on fully killing anyone, instead spreading out the pain.
---
If I tunnel on someone it is either because they seem to want me to chase them the most and that is fun for both of us... or they are being a miserable little cunt that needs to be removed from the match as fast as possible.
---
I got that myself once. I'd been de ranked to 17, so I grabbed Bubba because I didn't know how it would go.
---
I ran each person all over, switching targets, kicking gens, trying not to be a colossal dick. I had a cypress Mori because I never play Bubba, just leveled him for perks, and had a pile of the stupid things. Ended with a 3K and a DC on the mori.
---
Dude went OFF in post game. Chewed me out for being toxic and using perks. I'm not good enough to be some kind of high holy terror, especially on Bubba. I could have baited deer with all the salt thrown my way.
---
Freddy is one of the strongest killers though?
---
A survivor doesn’t need to escape to max out the survival category normally I’m fine with dying in a farm game if I can get everything maxed out
---
I play Billy... the amount of people I accidentally tunnel on while trying to zip around the level so I can laugh while playing with my chainsaw is far higher than I am comfortable with.
---
I feel like Rin would be a good candidate for reform.
---
You should be PROUD of yourself Mr. Phillip Ojomo!
---
I P3 my mains on both sides for the trophy but I don't see much of a point in it. I prestiged some other characters so I could use my bloodpoints, but I only wanted the bloody outfit on one character and the luck increase isn't enough for me to want to basically start all over.
---
everybody knows that amanda is the only one that can continue johns legacy! good job!
---
Who said that tunneling was a bad strategy? It's just an asshole's strategy.
---
Imagine having the worst reputation in the game as a camping baby killer
---
They sure as shit did, had a deadline with Nintendo I bet and they almost didn’t get that and now their mobile version is pushed back, then we won’t get a update on dedicated servers till the new year and knowing BhVR it will be late spring for that!
---
I got you some hacks for all your trapper needs otzcheats.com

Thana and dying light aren’t that great but ok together and ruin is ruin. Overall the build is ok
---
I'm not a Wraith main so rip
---
Idk I'm on xbox and hardly anyone plays him but I never had a problem with him in the past, he's pretty damn slow which balances it imo
---
I just feel like I need to finish stuff
---
I love this 😂 it’s definitely a trait seen in swf squads. I’ve had a friend get seriously tunneled (more unlucky then anything) and all I did was run near them and clicked my flashlight and tbagged once. It’s all they needed to switch focus and tunnel me the rest of the game 😂 if you’re aware of it, it can make it funny
---
It was a pretty toxic post
---
Tomes always exist apparently, it's just the rift fragments  that won't be here
---
"If you disconnect, the killer can't kill you."
---
There is no argument for ragequit DC...none...you finish the match do that your teammates aren't fucked over ...period.
---
&gt;Idk I'm on xbox and hardly anyone plays him but I never had a problem with him in the past, he's pretty damn slow which balances it imo
---
Is not a matter of balance... He isn't strong, he is annoying. Iridescent King will give you a headache IRL.
---
I agree but survivors are mostly toxic, so what
---
You can use anything you feel comfortable with , remember only the final hook must be on the basement
---
TURN UP THE FUCKING BRIGHTNESS FOR YAMAOKA ESTATE. ITS AWFUL. I CANT EVEN PLAY ON IT.
---
What's the nerf?
---
Absofuckinglutely lmao
---
Why is everyone in this generation a fucking snowflake.
---
If shit stinks everywhere you go, check your shoes
---
Am I saying that only SWF count? No. I'm saying that many games, that could've been won by survivors are lost because they either gave up fir some reason or threw a game. I recall many games where killer wasn't able to do anything till the end, where I and other survivors got SO cocky that we literally made a suicide move and couldn't comeback. This doesn't mean survivors were weaker in general. It is just one grave mistake that ruined everything.
---
i think it might be a buff actually, well... an addon buff. not too sure.
---
I USUALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM PLAYING ON CONSOLE BUT HOLY SHIT THE AMOUNT OF TIMES SURVIVORS RUN UP TO ME AND
---
1. I CAN'T SEE THEM
---
2. JOYSTICKS MEAN I CAN'T TURN FAST
---
3. I USUALLY PLAY HILLBILLY
---
MEANS THERE'S NO COUNTERPLAY TO DOING THAT ONCE I REV MY SAW. I HAVE TO GAMBLE OR JUST GO FOR BASIC HITS, WHICH IS REALLY FRUSTRATING
---
Ok boomer
---
Eh
---
When you buy legion you can play as frank and julie.
---
Yes. Frank and Julie are free but you need to pay for Joey and Susie
---
I’m a 7 yr old boomer, noice. Grow up ya pussy😂
---
No
---
The skins/cosmetics change the sex and character the most popular ones are Frank and Susie
---
that sucks
---
awesome to hear. thanks!
---
As fun as that would be, it would be too easy to insert a mute sound file to completely remove any music during a chase for a hearind advantage.
---
I think thana is only good when paired with other perks by itself it’s just bad
---
Lmao🤣
---
Then as Killer I have an easier time of staying in games for 9+ minutes. Either that or the rift progress fucks up sometimes.
---
I’ve legit played for 4 hours a few nights as survivor and only gotten through one tier. To be fair, though, about 1 hour of that is waiting for a lobby.
---
I was just gonna say this
---
Yeah that could work idk how they would do it but  that would be a good feature
---
The fact that the game has no brightness setting proves there is an in-game mcote skin always watching you from the bushes of love
---
Usually Legion art work on this Sub Reddit is terrible, but this is pretty freaking sweet.
---
I wonder if put a perk or add on that apply hemorrhage on Oni or legion. Does that mean you could bleed out almost instantly from loss of blood causing you to die?
---
Legion knows where to stab.
---
They stab not cut

So not much interesting. The end those was hhhh. So bad internet. A gen exploded while I was halfway down the basement... So around the end another Nea distracted Doc and she got out. With about 20 seconds on the clock I opened the other gate (I would’ve died if I couldn’t have found it). I quickly opened the rest (I had about 1/3 done before Doc chased me again. I was legit scared. So quickly without Wake Up! I opened the gate and ran for my life to the exit. I made it. 2 ticks on the clock later and I would’ve died.
---
bbq
---
I haven't tried it, but that makes sense.  By switching lockers, you are still moving.
---
Its enough to hit 2 different survibors and suck like 1 orb to get his power its easy as fuck
---
If survivors do it and killers do it they're both double standards. If both sides do the same thing the standards are no longer doubled. It just becomes the standard!
---
 Why is it always a Nea?
---
We found god.

Make the color more vibrant in ways that color blind people can actually see, their are many variations of color blindness. It wouldn’t be hard to implement

The build isn’t particularly good as much as it is gimmicky. You can nearly infinite him by using multiple loops since he won’t catch up in time. The whole build is about not chasing but if the survivors heal after every initial hit and the Myers isn’t chasing then it’s hard for Myers to actually perform well.
---
Definitely destroys survivors who don’t know how to deal with it well or have potato teammates lol. It’s also really fun to jumpscare everybody.
---
Yup...finish that shit!
---
I’ve learned that as a Nea player I act like No0b3 in which if I’ve been an asshole to the killer I’ll just accept getting killed or tunneled bc I know it’s fair enough
---
Lately, I've been having trouble with my internet connection. Sometimes I can play, but every once in a while, I'll randomly lose my connection which kicks me out of the game. It just happened and now I have to wait 5 minutes to play again. This sucks.
---
Or, I play smart.
---
Or you get lucky
---
Ill say if the hex made the terror radius the size of the map it might synergies well with other perk build like clourophobia, unnerving, overwhelming and even killer like doctor, legion and maybe spirit to hide the woshing sound. Maybe it activate at a certain time interval during chase or injuring a survivor after a certain amount of time to prevent survivor getting ear rape all the time? But its just my opinion...

Tunneling and camping is a terrible strategy most situations. Let's use your example where we return to the hook and the unhooked survivor runs off to the left and the healthy survivor run off to the right. 
---
You chase the injured survivor: they loop you for a few seconds then get hit. They tank your hit with BT. You chase them some more, maybe around one or two loops, then down them again. You get hit with DS. They gain a bunch of distance and get to more loops. What are the other 3 survivors doing? They're on gens. You finally get the injured survivor on a hook and 2 gens pop if they're lucky, then you repeat the process 2 more times. Game's over, everyone escaped except for the one guy you tunneled.
---
Now, instead, you go for the healthy survivor: you've more then likely got an early hit off either right after they unhooked or shortly after. They're now injured, only they don't have DS and BT to save them. You down them much faster and hook them. What have the other survivors been doing? The injured guy more then likely went off somewhere to either heal themselves or find someone to heal them. That's only 1-2 guys on gens now, and considering you'd probably get the healthy guy on the hook faster you'd only have maybe 1 gen pop at most.
---
That’s pretty smart
---
And then there’s Haddonfield.
---
I call everyone “my guy” it’s a New York thing lmao
---
If spirit were alive she’d be my number 1 contender but due to her being undead legion. 3/4 anyway, Frank is a pos.
---
Is it been just me or has Myers' terror radius been super small even though he's in Teir 2/3?
---
damn how'd u get info and post this that fast you must live in brandon
---
it just doesn't suit meg at all
---
the pants are probably actually the only very Meg thing about them
---
VERY RARELY DO I COMPLAIN ABOUT KILLERS BUT TONIGHT WAS THE MOST BLATANT CAMPING AND TUNNELING I'VE EVER SEEN FROM A DOCTOR THAT CHASED AND HOOKED ME FROM VERY START OF GAME UNTIL I WAS DEAD.  DIDNT HELP THAT MY TEAMMATE DECIDED TO IMMERSE THEMSELVES AFTER THE LAST UNHOOK INSTEAD OF TAKING A HIT FOR ME
---
Doesn’t closet cosplay mean average stuff from around the house in its entirety? By that definition, aren’t all closet cosplays relatively low effort/resource since that’s the point?
---
At least I'm not so desperate to create a new account to harass others :D
---
DBD was on the list of free games for August. I know cause I have a screenshot I took on the first match I played and it was taken on the 11th of the August
---
I mean, you're making a choice to make the game less fun &amp; more emotionally trying for the killer. People often already find playing killer stressful. They're getting ganged up on by 4 people, hatemail &amp; unkindness are frequent, etc. Your choice is utilitarian rather than sadistic, but I think people are within their rights to dislike this, and even call it toxic, to piggyback off a toxic atmosphere and be indistinguishable from a toxic player so you can win.
---
Fuck me XD. I was typing way too fast
---
Yuh
---
Yes good catch.
---
Same man I hate getting camped so I try to move away pretty quick, but you’re right they make it impossible sometimes unless you want to just throw the game
---
Those 2 are the only ones I really have a problem with tbh. I feel like the dark sense one is utter bullshit, 3 was hard, but okay and doable. 4 just either requires the most potato of teammates, the most incredible luck, or forcing to play a certain way with swf. If it wasnt so close to when the rift was gonna close it MIGHT be okay, but since there is a lot of people going for this challenge, I'd say I would just wait a bit before trying to do this one. So many games where 2 gens are popped at the same time, with the 3rd shortly after, then bam you have to try to do this challenge again. Same thing with the basement one, it would be one thing to hook all 4 survivors once in the basement in a match, but its sacrifice. Basically requires an insidious camping twat, which as I'm sure bhvr knows the vast majority of the community hates playing that way/against it. So to basically force someone to play that way is bullshit. Then to lock lore behind that? I think they've lost their damn minds.
---
Sure buddy. Whatever you say
---
This is loss
---
Mark as spoiler please
---
Nobody can accept some people just play well lol.
---
Some time there yeah. I can't remember anything
---
Don't say that too loud! The Neas will get sad!
---
Calling it right now, OP is baiting for someone to call him a normie.
---
Like everyone else said. BBQ
---
yea that was the whole point of my comment
---
actually there were two survivors left, one had already died
---
It's not a nerf, he's getting changed, and the changes sound incredibly promising (Of course, we need to see how they pan out before saying it's a nerf or buff):
---
- Not sure if he still has Treatment and Punishment modes.
---
- Has a new ability that shocks **EVERYONE** in Terror Radius instantly.
---
- changes to his add-ons. Chance for skillchecks to move counterclockwise instead of clockwise for instance.
---
And a couple of other changes. Even if it's the only change they do to him, getting rid of Stances would be a HUGE buff to him.
---
ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD IF YOU JUST RUN AGITATION AND PATROL THE BASEMENT HEAVILY. GOT IT IN MY FIRST MATCH, BUT TO BE FAIR THE SURVIVORS WERE PEPEGA-BRAIN RETARDS.
---
[SACRIFICE 4 PEOPLE IN THE BASEMENT, HOWEVER...](/intensifies) DOES BEHAVIOUR PLAY THEIR OWN FUCKING GAME?
---
Yo
---
Tq :)
---
[ESPECIALLY](/intensifies) in the basement!
---
You don't know what a double standard is, do you?
---
I mean, I think you can still only put them in the basement on third hook and it will still counts, but I agree it's pretty hard doing these challenges with people dcing all the time
---
When does the actual video start wtf. Why am I sitting here 3 minutes in without a mention of the topic of the video
---
Dcers that stop playing the game entirely is still a victory for all legitimate players of TEAM based games...that's what it's all about.. getting the DCERS to either play the game through or stop playing entirely.
---
Huh? This is a meme about him laughing, it’s not even complaining in any way?
---
Waiting for somebody to come in and ask what did you to deserve it
---
SIX FEET UNDER AND DARK SENSES ARE FUCKING BULLSHIT. YOU CAN LITERALLY ONLY DO DARK SENSES IN A 4 MAN SWF IF YOUR ALLIES LEAVE THE GENS FOR YOU (ALSO HELPS IF THE KILLER IS FARMING), AND YOU LITERALLY CAN'T DO SIX FEET UNDER UNLESS YOU INTENTIONALLY DERANK TO RANK 15 AND PLAY BASEMENT BUBBA.
---
THESE TWO RIFTS PROVE THAT BEHAVIOUR DOESN'T PLAY THEIR OWN FUCKING GAME. I MEAN THE FACT THAT THEY THINK HOOKING 5 PEOPLE IN THE BASEMENT IN ONE MATCH OR OPENING 12 CHESTS ISN'T TEDIOUS AS FUCK MAKES ME LAUGH.
---
I'M NOT FUCKING BUYING THE NEXT RIFT PASS IF THIS IS THE KIND OF SHIT I CAN EXPECT FROM IT. A BUNCH OF CRAPPY RESKINNED COSMETICS ISN'T WORTH THE HEADACHE. PUT SHARDS OR AT LEAST BLOODPOINTS ON THE RIFT LEVELS AND I MIGHT CARE.
---
The whole point of this game was for me to be trained to a higher rank smh🤦🏻‍♂️
---
The name checks out.
---
How many hours you have in the game?
---
I cannot conceive that's an idea coming from someone who hasn't just bought the game
---
That’s awful, I wish you the best of luck in finishing.
---
I fucking love Doctor. I can't wait ti see what they do to him.
---
No offense dude but toxicity goes both ways. Camping, tunneling, mori’s, slugging for the 4k(or in general) are all pretty toxic acts by killers. These acts will annoy survivors into using the “meta perks” killers always bitch about like DS and it causes this toxic behavior from both sides. As a survivor getting 4 k’d before getting like 1 or 2 gens done is annoying so some like to celebrate those small victories like pallet stuns or escapes. If it bothers you that much git gud or play something else.
---
Yeah that sounds about right :(
---
Download it with the Tap app and you can set your country
---
Just slug the guy who got unhooked and chase down the dude who was a dumbass. The guy who was on the hook doesn't get punished because his friend was an idiot, and the guy who unhooked doesn't get rewarded for being an idiot.
---
It's what I do, and I've gotten a remarkably little hate for it
---
Wow, you're so bad at the game you got negative hits on the survivors. /s
---
I was including David. On the hook doesn't mean out of the game
---
just got this just now. it helps to be injured but no. use no mither and the perk
---
Omg omg I can't find it!!
---
Evey pig main's wet dream
---
If you want to use the perk, you have to be injured. I’m guessing you need to have it on to help people who struggle to hit great skill checks.
---
The guy is trolling you get all 4 base skins when you get legion
---
Alright, thank you so much for all the info!!!
---
Kind of sounds like Margot Verger from Hannibal. Maybe the survivor is Clarice haha
---
Cursed titles
---
It's funny because if he hadn't been hitting me he probably could have grabbed that bill. Baby killers gonna baby killer though lol.
---
First off, git gud? Yep definitely plays survivor. But second off I know but as a killer, i don't comaplain to the survivors for gen rushing or pallet stunning me or anything. We should give respect to each other even if we play different sides of a same story. 
---
Also I do agree kinda for the toxic part, tunneling and slugging I'm general is toxic as all hell, but camping and mori's are fine, camping if it's used in a non toxic way are fine I think, but doing it for no reason is just plain dumb. But I don't think using or having a Mori is toxic, it's a part of the game. Don't like getting morried then talk to the Devs about them which won't get you very far at all.
---
I just had a ghostface tunnel me into the ground for dismantling the ruin because my friend hates ruin skillchecks. Got tunneled each unhook and then died. I spectate my friend and the fucker starts farming with everyone.
---
Idk how to contact devs but u should defiantly voice that to them
---
Theres an endgame chat?
---
Sacrifice 5 survivors in the basement during the end game collapse after they have stepped in a trap.  
---
*Complete this challenge in a single trial.*
---
Is this loss?
---
I think he just wanted to get a rise out of me. I wasn't even teabagging or anything. It actually happens a lot in lower ranks.
---
this is good
---
This needs to be posted to r/oinkers_
---
Let me guess, your father works for Microsoft and you're gonna tell them if they don't work on what you say?
---
Hahahahahaha good one
---
Yeah, its intended. And to be honest i like each maps having unique bullshit about them. Most are survivor sided already so i dont mind if new yamaoka's is you need to rely on echolocation to see survs
---
The level 4 challenges released today, and some of them are pretty difficult, so I would not be surprised that people are farming a lot more. 
---
Farming is also frequent during double bloodpoint events. (the next one happens in January)
---
“I’m gonna put this short” writes 4 paragraph essay
---
Mad?
---
It helps if you're injured (30% increase in size of skill checks) but you don't have to be. Something that I'd recommend is sabotaging hooks if you need to find a way to get more skill checks to appear.
---
Well I didn't plan it out, I think and write, don't like it? Deal with it
---
Toxic?
---
The power is horrible. The whole point of killer is to end chases as fast as possible. You can win any chase by just bloodlusting, but that'd take forever. Waiting total of 90 seconds to get tier 3 is ridiculously weak.
---
Susie or Julie and Frank are much more redeemable than a natural born psychopath.
---
Julie or Susie, whichever one was forced to stab the janitor, is most likely.
---
You'll be in a world of pure imagination when I knock you unconscious with a pallet to your face.
---
Sorry if it’s not clear. I’m not saying the other actions are toxic (well except t-bagging) . Mainly trying to point out how killers are called tunnelers if they kill the most obnoxious player that’s always in their face X3
---

---
Ohhhh I get it now. Thanks, sorry I missed the point lol. Good art btw.
---
No one's saying they aren't.  The joke of the comic is the Nea is going *out of her way* to get the killer's attention, then complaining that the killer only paid attention to her.
---
There's nothing inherently toxic with trying to play the distraction so your team can do objectives, but complaining that you got killed because of it is.  The distraction is a high-risk strategy that makes the distraction the most likely player to get killed.
---
Similarly, if you're too obvious about going for the distraction strategy, a smart killer will realize you're the least worthwhile target to chase and go for the rest of the team.  A player going for the distraction angle is going to spend less time on objectives and more time on being near the killer, so they're never worth chasing; they most likely have lots of chase-extension perks anyway.  It's a smarter play to get rid of the rest of the team, and get the high-visibility player in the endgame where you don't have to worry about what the rest of the team is doing during the extended chase.
---
"Only noobs tunnel"
---
it seems that Feeding Time is a bit too similiar to Stridor, which is a Nurse perk that makes breathing louder, and FotW is a bit similar to Surveilance, which is a Pig perk, though i do like the concept of Inhuman Instincts. It has a lot of potential! &lt;3
---
I swear this game needs better totem spots
---
I personally don’t have a huge problem with them. They’re there to rob the survivors of a full game just like keys are there to rob the killers a full game. So ying a yang but my main point is we’re all pointing fingers at the wrong people. Basically what i’m saying is if a survivor is toxic in one game it may make a killer toxic in the next and so on and so forth. If we stopped reacting to these behaviors by our fellow players then they would stop. Don’t let shitty people turn you into one.

ooof sorry man. Thanks for explaining it though

---
The problem is that if you balance for SWF with comms then solo queue suffers massively.

Survivor bad killer good. Ah yes the purest form of comedy

My favorite comment on dc'ing is people being mad at a 1 minute temp ban.
---
[Wraith's chase music](https://youtu.be/J0uGnm3dGvc?t=4)
---
Theres always a noticable difference in survivors. If I outplay/ drop a survivor who T-bags in front of pallets and flashlights on every pallet from my experience at least they have a higher chance of dcing than a claudette that spends all game in a bush or even a baby dweet or literally any other normal player who finds dcing to be petty. And also, are dc penalties out now or is that just being tested. Either way you'll eventually get it if you keep trying as there are some people who just dont dc.
---
I prefer a challenge.
---
you DC much less because of a game hostage killer than survs who DC because of entitlement. I think its giod im sure theyll tweak the numbers as needed
---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY *ENJOY*?
---
I'd rather have a killer that can sabotage stuff like copying and disabling survivor perks and tools.
---
Honestly, I'd have laughed my ass off if you rolled with it and said: "Man, that Claudette buff though."
---
Yes. In my opinion, assholes who tunnel a e noobs.
---
Your post has 3 sentences in it and 2 of them are filler. The one sentence of substance has exactly what I referenced in it. I have well over 1000 hours in this game and I've been playing since launch and MAYBE 1 in every 200 or so games I've had an actual game breaking bug. That's a big maybe also. Sure a small bug here and there can happen but an actual game breaking bug very very rarely happens. The last one was the basement bug last patch and that was fixed in a few days. Keep crying though. Again we wont miss you.
---
In this case both groups are inflincting the same standard on each other. Making it the standard for both groups. Obviously YOU don't have reading comprehension if i have to explain this to you. Merry Christmas and goodbye.
---
I'm not taking this personal at all. 
---
Lag isnt a bug, its lag. 
---
Hit through pallets also isnt a bug. Its lag or (usually the case) ment to happen. 
---
Perks not activating literally never happened to me once so if it happens to you every time you play idk what to tell you. Your either exaggerating or unlucky. 
---
Falling through the map again never happened to me. I see it here and there but every time you play? My ass.
---
This needs more attention 😂😂😂
---
Don't worry, if they say something racist (such as the aforementioned gamer word) and I match with them again, i'm making sure they don't make it out alive :)
---
I know it probably would go against the point of the challenge, but I wish if someone DC'd it would automatically give some credit to the challenge if applicable.
---
That's not an excuse to quit. Quitting is toxic. Period.
---
This is so accurate lol. The Rift ends in 20 days, and I think a lot of people are starting farm.
---
I wish I had that much time :(
---
They need to stop giving Dwight and Claude cosmetics when others barely get any. So sick of these two getting preferential treatment. Meg gets a lot too but hey stuff are crap.
---
Thank you, I'm glad someone has common sense. But you are correct. But I don't try to be toxic, as a killer or survivor, I just play the game however it goes.
---
I completed level 4 in 2 hours of release because of people farming. Helps too that I coaxed them in with BPS.
---
You are correct, just finished it and only got two while injured.
---
Yeah. It’s comedy cause I’m showing how ridiculous they are being for calling that tunneling.
---
Nature of the beast. Nothing you can change except your own perspective. Ive it so much i just think of them as cuties
---
You speak words of wisdom
---
It doesn't
---
Thanks
---
I love the look the wraith gave the Nea. The wtf look.
---
You DC less often because of bugs and gamehostage scenarios than DC out of entitlement
---
Leaked Level 5 challenge:
---
Spend $20 on Auric Cells. Must be done in a single trial
---
Honestly I’m ok with that
---
Yup
---
Lol the video I just put up says otherwise.
---
Could be  possible but I would love their own take on this.
---
I have no idea how you did that. Frankly I'm impressed
---
I feel, I never touched nurse on the Game because the teleport threw me off so much
---
How about no and keep the music free for everybody to listen to.
---
I mean, both Demo and Oni have global sound effects anyway.
---
Honestly, I don't quite understand this argument since most killers either already have sound effects/map items that reveal who they are before you'd hear the TR music (Pig, Plague, Trapper, Freddy, Chainsaw Boys, Demo, Oni, Huntress Humming) or abilities that would hide the TR music until they wanted to be revealed anyway (Ghostface, Myers, Wraith).  The only killers that would be affected are Doctor, Clown, and Hag and I don't think any of them get any real advantage from not knowing they're the killer until you see them (especially because there's the possibility you might hear a Doctor-triggered scream, see a Clown Cloud, or set off a Hag trap before you hear their TR music anyway).
---
I don’t wanna be rude that’s a pretty stupid thing to say. If you fall through the map you just... stay? I had one guy who couldn’t die earlier. He couldn’t be downed, couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything. And you’re saying he should’ve stayed there? Even though the game has broken for him, he should stay because otherwise he’s toxic?
---
That laugh at the end lol
---
What you call a free escape is really just another mechanic you don't like because you're so used to the killer being catered to.  You got EGC slugging, but the hatch feels like too much?  That's just sad man.
---
&gt; In this case both groups are inflincting the same standard on each other.
---
Clearly people on both sides have a double standard when it comes to this, but the point of my comment had absolutely nothing to do with that. I think you've completely lost track of what's going on, and are instead standing off on your own making all these attempts at good points, when the only person you're talking to is yourself. 
---
I don't know why you felt it necessary to completely derail your thought process, but you keep up fighting that straw man you spent all this time creating.
---
W h a t ?
---
I love how not a single one one knew they would go off
---
IVE BEEN GONE FROM THE GAME FOR A WHILE AND DID THEY TAKE PRAYER BEADS AWAY FROM SPIRIT BECAUSE IVE GONE THROUGH 30 LEVELS AND HAVENT GOTTEN ANY AND EITHER WAY THIS IS BULLSHIT.
---
Not really sure what you could do though. They've already got cosmetics in play so you can't have a system like "press your power and you change to X who have different stats" unless they make default outfits for them. I don't think the power is inherently bad, it's an interesting power, it's just not really handled well.
---
I think if you have deliverance you should absolutely be able to, granted that it is your first hook.
---
DROP PALLET, WAIT FOR BREAK ANIMATION, USE FLASHLIGHT. EZ.
---
AGITATION, IRON GRASP, TRAPPER. GG EZ.
---
I thought this would be funnier after seeing it for the 100th time, but it's not.
---
😢
---
The crossover nobody asked for but let's be honest we would all have to watch out of utter curiosity
---
Console?
---
I guess I didn't fully understand the comic. I sometimes complain about tunnelers but I never try to be too obvious about distracting. It usually backfires on me anyway.
---
However it is very difficult to tell sometimes whether someone is tunneling or if it's just a really crappy coincidence that you're always the one found lol. 
---
I always try to be nice to killers even if they may or may not be intentionally tunneling. There's no reason to start name calling in the chat.
---
I never said that. If the game is physically bugged and you cant be killed, sure quit. Its helpful to if you stay in lobby and explain you couldn't be killed or you fell through the map. That's literally the only valid reason to quit. And like I said that barely ever happens. 99.9% of the time people quit it's because they are salty or "I dont like this killer"
---
Dcs are only being tested on PC and switch
---
Lmao I just kneeeeew he was mad! He camped for 3 gens and got no kills! Shit was wild
---
If you wanted feedback, you can just come to this page and ask for it. So, so many people will gladly give it to you, I guarantee... but from what I can see, you are upset because the survivors didn’t give you something you never even explicitly asked for. I wouldn’t even go as far as to call them ignorant cunts because they decided not to be your teacher... Said players might not even have the best skills as killer, nor the experience. Also, nobody said anything was your fault, you just posted this and expected sympathy, when not one persons sees why they owed you anything in the first place. I’m sorry that matchmaking wasn’t in your favour, but with how long queue is at the moment, it’s no surprise that everybody wants to leave to get onto their next game ASAP. 
---
Again, there’s a lot of helpful people here who will tell you how you can improve. I’ve seen fresh killers - and survivors - post videos of their games, asking the community how they can do better, and Reddit users usually come through.
---
how did you finish the do 4 gens with the perk dark sense? it seems impossible doing 4 gens all by yourself in solo queue
---
I did this last night, it was annoying. And the survivors just stayed there. One even killed himself with the Endgame instead of leaving and not wasting more of my time.
---
Now that's a epic gamer moment
---
Do that, and we'll have 15 more bugs
---
I got it in one go with Iron Grasp, Agitation, Discordance, and a lot of traps on Trapper.  Macmillan Estate is an easy map option for it; Shelter Woods would probably be best, but I did it on Ironworks.
---
I have to turn off my music and stay completely silent so that I can at least use one of my senses on that goddamn map.
---
OBVIOUSLY! DEAD BY DAYLIGHT IS FILLED WITH SCUMMY PLAYERS TO THE POINT WHERE THE DEVELOPERS JUST USED THE IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM JOIN THEM AND ARE JUST MAKING PEOPLE DO IT!
---
“Stacks” is outdated
---
I agree but I'm usually like "be toxic? The others pay for it" Because as the killer, you kill, no mercy from me lol
---
If you already got at least level 1 of one of his perks you can keep leveling them up. Otherwise you'll need to unlock his teachables to get the perk for the first time.
---
Do you know how to complete the hook 4 survivors in the basement one?
---
How do you think I feel being an Adam main.
---
Level 4 done in 3 hours from farming the lower killer path.  FEELS GOOD MAN
---
Bye, don't come back please
---
OMG I FORGOT TO ADD THE EXHAUSTION thanks for reminding me. 
---
And yes, you do. so its a high risk thing, like dead hard.
---
And that's totally fine! It's the killers objective to kill. But for me personally, I feel like I showed em up more like HA! LEAVE AT *MY* MERCY 😂😂😂
---
And I'm still practicing, so I'm fine not pippig up teehee
---
I wish it only happened because of survivor toxicity. Most of the time it's just, well, tunneling.
---
Currently in this situation; basement stuff was fine.  Getting a game with 4 Dark Sense gens is a crap-shoot.
---
Oh you definitely did.
---
How so? The permanent debuff can be rough.
---
I this PS4?
---
Fuuuuck I remember lmms
---
You just need to be on the gens when they pop, use Bond to find other survivors. Prove Thyself is also a good perk.
---
Appreciate this!!!
---
That's literally how I did mine mate. Lmao
---
To be honest, I’m not quite sure what it is you want to hear anymore. You can post /A/ clip from /A/ game, or, to keep it general, write about how you usually perform, your most commonly used perks, who your main is, etc. and I’m sure that somebody will give advice - assuming that is what you’re seeking? You do not have to post the WHOLE video and EVERY video... common sense, please. Or, at least thoroughly explain what answers you are looking for, because again, I’m quite lost now as you to what you wanted to get out of this post.
---
Like, after every match, you want all the survivors to stay back and give you feedback? Again, they aren’t obligated to do that, and many killers and survivors that want to improve will not make it priority to seek help from the people they just played with. Also, Youtubers like Otz exist to help killers improve their gameplay. You can start from there.
---
Not injured which makes it even easier imo, all that practice against ruin pays off ;D
---
Lmao 🤣that is a good idea, I'm gonna use that now
---
To save a teammate by getting the attention of the killer through the only possible methods(tbagging or clicking a flashlight for 2 seconds)...is making the game less fun or emotionally trying for "the killer" wow. So I'm just suppose to let the killer kill my less skilled teammate so that the killer has more fun? This is exactly what I meant lol. 
---
If I can get the killers attention so that I save a teammate from dying who has already been hooked a few times, that is toxic? I'm really trying to understand?
---
I don’t know what you’re talking about. I play both roles evenly. This isn’t some kind of “us vs them” scenario I’m just talking about the game balance as a whole. If the killer kills 3 survivors then it shouldn’t be so easy for the last one to escape. It’s a 4vs1 game for a reason. If the survivors manage to all die then the killer shouldn’t have so much trouble trying to stop the last survivor because they pretty much already lost. If the last survivor gets a higher chance of escape then that’s stupid because they did nothing to earn the escape except being alive last.
---
I see ya point,I’m abit unlucky with killer where I’m at, some reason I take longer to get killer games, but my surv ones only a min or two. St least with killer games you are there to the end no matter what
---
Yes and can we also fix Quentin's face soon.
---
Bro this shit happened to me too as legion. Fuck me
---
Elaborate, please.
---
On other killers, yes. On plague her power already makes them unable to heal. Unless they cleanse, which you want them to do.
---
No biggie
---
Even on plague it’s really not good.
---
What do you mean?? There’s a bunch of reverse psychology tactics like that and a bunch of people use them
---
Please mark as spoiler
---
When you 99 the exit gates to try and save someone off a hook and some pleb comes along opens the exit gate and the killer manages to down you because NOED and everyone dips on you even though it’s your first hook
---
That’s me every time I’m in a game with a leatherface with insidious😂
---
Her phase offers no feedback which in turn leads to a guessing game which leads to you not feeling out played considering she has ears and can see grass move.
---
I wish I could post age old content and still have fans hype it up because they're too stupid to fathom lol
---
lmaoo. im a producer and its like my favorite daw to use
---
don't forget that Susie's version of a knife is actually a broken ruler.
---
16% gen reduction is very good.
---
He was just too dizzy to walk afterwards
---
It also permanently buffs 1/4 survivors basically giving them better botany knowledge
---
Urh no not really, "I'm not racist but.." is usually followed by something racist. Just because somebody says "I play both sides" followed by an opinion that you disagree with doesn't get it the same equivalence. What a false dichotomy and logical fallacy.
---
It's kinda mandatory at high ranks as you have to pressure survivors otherwise gens will get done quickly.
---
Looks like deranking to me
---
On PC there is
---
Yeah same, I produce for Tommie Profitt.
---
I grew up using lmms and now logic mainly but yeah.
---
I just don't find him very annoying he's no more annoying than any of the others :/
---
Damn why you gotta do ayrun like that.
---
That’s just 13 seconds. That’s not very good
---
Amaz—GROOVY
---
Man, it's really sad that so many people don't give a flying fuck about other people's experiences. You're playing against other people, not robots. I hook it and book it, and I rarely tunnel. I get a 3-4k almost every match so It's not like tunneling/camping is the only way to win.
---
OP: "Don't like toxic behavior? Quit crying it's just a game."
---
Also OP: "Why are people so fucking toxic? It's just a game."
---
If you're going to do it, do it properly with No mither...All the way in
---
Talk about haunted grounds 😂😂
---
Apparently you didn't loop to well becuase you still have 4 gens to go.
---
Why is the camera so zoomed out you can fully see clowns hand here
---
BAM BAM
---
I PLAY ON PS4 DUDE, EAT MY ASS
---
Yup you are correct. It's a kind of hook tech 'glitch' where the saver squats under the hooked teammate. If the killer swings, the saver can't get hit. So you just wait there for them to make a move instead, but then you'll be considered camping. I'm sure there are ways to fake leaving, but it's just a tad annoying to go against. The faces of the saver are legit like the nea in the comic, they know you can't do jack sh*t and just t-bag under the hook haha XD
---
So I had my first matchmaking locked. Game crashed during loadout by the time I loaded my game again the timer is at 5sec so what was that? A 1minute Matchmaking ban for the 1st time?
---
Also, I think the ban should only count if the game started...
---
Thanks, it really is a good one :)
---
Here's an idea to prevent disconnecting: play the game you queued up for instead of being a salty asshole because ["WAAAAAAAAAAAAAN THE KILLER HAS TO HOOK ME ONE LESS TIME TOO OP BHVR SO KILLER-SIDED!!!!!!1111"](/intensifies)
---
Thanks!! :D
---
They could've looped the killer,  they cannot control how many gens their team does. :/ I've ran the killer forever and the only two gens done was the ones my swf did. Other two did NOTHING. 
---
But yes OP,  killers will camp you if they don't wanna chase you again or they'll insta tunnel you smh.
---
salty, definitely
---
Because the actual state of the game is not toxic or tryhard?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mREPd_GPlKg
---
As someone who is constantly basement camped, believe me, it is very likely
---
I can never seem to beat Hillbilly. I always panic and get sawd. But he is just hilarious looking.
---
It's the chicken and the mother fucking egg. 
---
Because killers are too. I play both main and there are games where I come across the survivors you mention but I had a game where all I was trying to do was the archive challenge and the killer tunnels me with a bear trap on my fucking head, like wtf!This is probably why people join swfs and bully the killer and this killer might have acted this way because people where in swfs in previous games and bullied him
---
I hope some community members who made their own tracks get selected for the music. There are some good ones out there.
---
Funny you even mention furry cause there are no animals in the animation, I guess everything you don't like is an animal?
---
There’s a difference between unfun and uncounterable
---
Oh god, especially after unhooks. I'll intentionally focus the saviour and somehow round a corner into the guy who just got unhooked.
---
I appreciate your nice comments, and I don't appreciate your hate comments. I am going to be strait forward with my thoughts like you are with yours.
---
75% OF WHAT I SAY IS CALLING PEOPLE OUT FOR BITCHING AND COMPLAINING THAT THEIR OPPONENT TRIED TO WIN THE GAME. TRYING TO WIN ISN'T TOXIC. COMPLAINING ABOUT IT, IRONICALLY, IS.
---
AND MY ACTIONS SO CONSISTENCY HERE. I SEE A BITCH, I CALL A BITCH.
---
QUIT YOUR BITCHING.
---
ALSO - WHERE ARE YOUR CAPITAL LETTERS?!
---
I am sad all the time but that is not a reason to farm
---
I played against 3 SWF Claudettes who brought a Yamaoka's offering, I camped the shit out of one of them because I knew other one was around there (I had Whispers), the 2nd one unhook the 1st when she was in struggle, downed the 2 lf them (I was Billy), the 3rd one appeared, I hooked her also and lefr the 1st one on the ground, just in case of Decisive...I just waited in the lobby to see if any of them said anything (Because you know...3 Clauds that used a Yamaoka's offering, you can already tell they wanted to troll the killer) but neither of them said anything
---
Yep. Been happening for 3 strong years. It will never stop.
---
OH. MY BAD.
---
&gt; THAT AIN'T RUIN, THAT'S YOUR PS4.
---
&gt; SOUNDS LIKE A YOUR PROBLEM.
---
THERE. I FIXED IT FOR YOU.
---
ALSO - AT LEAST BUY ME DINNER FIRST. I EXPECT SOMETHING FANCY. LIKE ARBY'S.
---
As a Adam main i feel sad :c
---
i use the afro with glasses with the swagger body, but i get tunneled so hard every game because of the $wag..
---
I want a gangster thuglife Adam skin so he can hustle even more. GIVE ADAM MORE $WAG AND LOVE BHVR
---
Just say "I farted".
---
Confusion and redundance, all in two words.
---
Isn’t uncounterable unfun?
---
This happened to me the other night 😂😂😂
---
It was hard to do gens...from my hook!! HAHA, seriously though, uhm team?
---
mained him since he came out, he is the only character I have P3 with all perks.
---
There is no "i" in team. There is in Killer though...sadly.
---
MAYBE DEVS SHOULD OPTIMIZE THEIR GAME A LIL BETTER TBH IVE SEEN LAGGY SKILLCHECKS ON GOOD PCS TOO, ALSO WILL WENDYS SUFFICE? THEIR FROSTEES ARE POSITIVELY DIVINE
---
Then I miss it because I shuffled around as it came up and threw off my timing, rip.
---
That’s what I thought it was, but I wanted to make sure. Thanks!
---
Not sure what the team was up to...hiding in lockers. Well, the one guy was at least doing gens.
---
With context of just this clip, what Ash did was fine.
---
Ye! That's what the Nea is doing in the comic. And then later she says "hook trick" is refering to this: https://youtu.be/PZ8ntmZ8WtQ?t=12
---
THE DEVS PROBABLY SHOULD, BUT THAT GRAPHICS THING IS DEFINITELY CLIENT SIDE.
---
ALSO - CAN I GET SOME SPICY NUGGS AND FRIES WITH THAT FROSTY? IF SO, YAS DADDY.
---
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IN A LOCKER. I'M A DWIGHT MAIN.
---
They aren’t PVP games that people take seriously and competitively? News to me...
---
https://youtu.be/PZ8ntmZ8WtQ?t=12
---
I'm not sure wether or not I want to spread this...... can- uh... hum... (please don't do it, and if you do, don't tbag the killer ty &lt;3)
---
WEAR THE HAT DADDY... WEAR THE HAT.
---
What really sucks is when you get funneled which is when the survivor who unhooked you is nowhere to be seen when the killer shows back up.
---
Hero of the people
---
Exactly! Sloppy, Dying Light, Coulrophobia, Thanatophobia, Swing Chains. So much better to completely forego the healing bar.
---
I've said it before on the original post, but if you wait over a minute for the killer to do something, it's either Hag, defensive Trapper, or Bloodwarden+NOED (or afk killer).  Most stealth killers will generally get their first hit in during the first minute unless they're disastrously spotted on approach.  Shape should have his global piano tune go off by the first minute in the worst case, and if he doesn't, then survivors have basically already won unless he's able to snowball into a 4 slug 4k.
---
Yes you do. You see it all the time.
---
And even if not, "other people do it too" is not an excuse. Being a dick is being a dick, even if other people are dicks too.
---
Ok.
---
You’re assuming ruin isn’t going to be gone in the first 1 minute of a game which happens too often ime. Thana paired with dying light I think is ok but by itself nope you just lose too much value other perks would give you for little gain
---
You mind explaining? My views on these go as follows..
---
Camping: you’re completely denying someone any chance of even playing the game cause of 1 mistake/outplay. 
---
Tunneling: equivalent to just kicking someone while they’re down. 
---
Mori’s: literally end the game halfway through so nobody gets to have fun. Also killers get less bp so i find it weird.
---
Slugging: yes everyone loves crawling on the ground for 4 minutes while you try to find the P3 Claudette in a bush. 
---
You may disagree but that’s my view from playing both sides. All of these have counters btw but if you don’t wanna call it toxic then let’s call it “playing like a pos”
---
its because you don't get enough hooks, you dont lose emblems for escaping. You start at zero and gain during the match. You dont lose anything for them getting out. You gain for getting hooks.
---
Feeding time is basically just stridor
---
Just get to the point.
---
I would watch some clips but never the whole movie. Saw was hard enough, centipede is just disgusto party
---
I legit like those hairstyles irl
---
I PHYSICALLY AM NOT CAPABLE OR NOT CARING
---
On Pc there is
---
what's OC mean?
---
There really isnt a solution that anyone other than the dev's can give, honestly the only thing that applies here is probably just patience as waiting for dc penalties is the only thing that could help, if it even ends up going through soon. But if you are gonna try then all I can say with certainty is good luck.
---
Killers with crossmap mobility like Hillbilly and Oni can use TI to effectively camp basement from across the map.  Hillbilly can chainsaw back and chainsaw the basement rescuer, while Oni can keep his rage in reserve until the proc, and then he can clear the whole distance before survivors realize he's coming back.
---
Ah yes, somebody who has never used Infinite T3 Myers
---
I’ve made several? Not to mention Overwatch and DBD both battle mettas and balancing of heroes and killers?   Waiting for you to make yours
---
?
---
My game crashed twice today.   
---
The first time I had to wait an hour, I guess i'll finish the rift in the morning.
---
you use too many terms i don't know haha
---
Probably leather face
---
Ah my b. I thought you meant max survival points for the entire category not just mac points for that action.
---
Uhhh I hate to brake it to you but bubba sawyer is kinda literally “mentally retarded”
---
It doesnt
---
I don't play this game, but I am curious. Could someone ELI5?
---
You mean jeff? Ash was on hook
---
Faced off against an actual tunneler. It was neat
---
My mom did
---
Hilarious
---
That and Bubba is a cutie pie.
---
Like, im ok when he is nowhere near me, but when I hear the heartbeat its like I forget how to play. It's bizzare.
---
Oops, yeah Jeff. But Ash did fine too.
---
Ill still dc if its a camping bubba
---
Ok?
---
If only i could choke this nea player
---
Have you watched the Evil Within III Downward stab? Knives are no joke.
---
&gt;Camping: you’re completely denying someone any chance of even playing the game cause of 1 mistake/outplay.
---
You are not denying "any chance", good survivors with Borrowed Time can still perform an unhook against most of the killer roster expect for a few specific scenarios such as Cannibal standing in front of the hook with his Chainsaw revved. If you have Decisive Strike, you also have a chance to live another day (even if the killer slugs). Not to mention all the other scenarios involving camping which would be the other 2 or 3 survivors escaping effortlessly. 
---
&gt;Tunneling: equivalent to just kicking someone while they’re down.
---
Tunneling is focusing on your goal, removing survivors from the game. Just like focusing generators over secondary objectives such as healing / totems. 
---
&gt;Mori’s: literally end the game halfway through so nobody gets to have fun. Also killers get less bp so i find it weird.
---
I don't think Mori's are fine but they are simply an item available for use and just like Keys, they are a shortcut to reach the objective (killing / escape).
---
&gt;You may disagree but that’s my view from playing both sides. 
---
I understand this is your view, which still doesn't change the fact that it is also the main reason why the word "toxic" is a joke. 
---
The equivalent of these on survivor side would be: Looping, hiding, gen rushing and a key. Before anyone say anything, I also don't have a problem with any of this but these are some of the complaints you see brought up by inexperienced killers. 
---
You can call all of this boring, unfun, unfair, scummy but none of this is toxic.
---
You dc'd because you couldn't sacrifice 4-8 seconds to help someone? Pretty petty imo. Not saying what they did was right, but still.
---
Ok
---
That same thing happened to me when I was swing at a cloudette and she just teleported.
---
My friend when two Claudettes queue with us. "Let's dodge, all Claudettes do is hide around the map, run up to gens I'm on, blow it up and then run away"
---
Me when two Meg's queue with us. "Nope, not dealing with two useless Meg's, they never touch gens and generally are a waste of a survivor slot, always throwing themselves at the hook with the killer right there"
---
I like to let the survivors who looped really well escape and kill the ones who suck. I’m a sucker for letting Megs go though since I main her
---
LOL
---
i mean jeff
---
Which is why I always make sure i'm quick to the trigger to ask them to farm before the match starts. It's a lot harder in game
---
DBD reddit is ass, its just a bunch of killer mains that downvote you if you say something about any killer
---
Speaking of him, i wonder if his power counts towards this challenge
---
Good name btw
---
I only DC’d because we got blocked into a corner haha
---
Huh?? You can’t be this weird. 
---
If two teammates are intentionally trying to stop you from playing the game, DCing is petty? Bad take.
---
100% crying
---
How on earth did you manage that. I’ve tried for 3 hours alone to get the 4 basement hook kills
---
none of em because health care too expensive
---
Lag switching for sure dude.
---
I DC’d because the killer and 2 other survivors trapped me and the other guy in the corner and didn’t let us out. It isn’t petty at all. If you want to complete challenges, find 4 survivors that are willing, or do it without the help. Simple.
---
The killer and 2 teammates blocked us into a corner lol
---
No, not sacrificing a few seconds to help someone is petty. You also seem to forget I did not condone what they did. I feel like everyone just needs to chill and take a hit.
---
this game is trash
---
i touch myself to clown
---
People seem to skim over they fact I didn't condone tge body blocking. But do you booboo.
---
as opposed to what the 1% chance each attmpt?
---
I’m sure people would rather play the actual game. Farming is outright boring and if you can’t get challenges done, then that’s your own problem.
---
&gt;LOL
---
Yep.
---
smh, I can tell you’re a killer main, I didn’t know you maimed Clown IRL too.
---
Is that word the combination of farmed + tunneled or F*cked + Tunneled? :'D Please educate me.
---
It "stacks" with effects like Bloody Party Streamers from Survivors or your BBQ
---
Survivor offerings (other than BBQ) affect either just them or all survivors (no matter if it states "personal" or not, that's outdated as well). Just read the offering in question. If it doesn't say anything about others, it only works for you
---
Plague gave me aids
---
lol. So true...so true.
---
I prefer to be the last guy and just get out
---
be nice but set messages to friends only
---
Balls
---
It happened again as soon as I posted this :(
---
Doctor is only annoying to play against when you camp pallets
---
I feel that
---
Mmmm I'm more of a mommy huntress type
---
The fact that this is an actual challenge... It pretty much promotes face camping. Not to mention that even if you pull it off, DCs can completely ruin it and I expect a DC if you get 4 people in the basement. Just shows how out of touch the devs are regarding balance. Everyone, get your pitchforks. Do what we did for Tome 3 and complain about it untill it's changed.
---
Scores
---
Sooo what you‘re saying is that you team up with three survivors and target one guy for playing the game as it‘s intended... I don‘t know where you come from, but this is literally the definition of griefing.
---
John wanted people to appreciate life more once they were able to escape a special trap for them. Amanda just makes a "game" That you can't win.
---
Probably farmed + tunneled idc I wasn’t the one who made it :b
---
*Susie drinking beer GIF*
---
Man, this reminds me of a game a few weeks ago. We had a DC, 3 people vs ghost face. 2nd guy sucides on hook. I get hooked and died soon after. My friend that I'm playing with struggles off his shoulder because the killer let him. Then the ghost face follows him to the gate, watches him doing it and pulled him off of the gate once, and downed him another time. At the 2nd time, he just hooked him. Didnt let my friend even open the door. Post game when we tell him to just kill us, dont BM us like that. The killer said we should appreciate the extra blood points.... what blood points? You get none from partial door opening progression. He said it wasnt even for a rift quest either. Some people. . . .
---
Sprint main no brain
---
Finally, a man of culture in this cesspool
---
You dramatically misunderstood my comment.  OP was saying that five minutes passed without any hud notifications (five minutes is ridiculous, so I spoke on the assumption he meant &gt;1 minute).  Additionally, there is the implication of no global sound notifications because of the title.  So the essence of OP's post is that there has been no sight, sound, or hud indication of the killer or their identity in over 1 minute from game start.  I decided to argue against the possibility that it was Michael based on those facts.
---
While Tuft does increase the evil needed between tiers II and III, it doesn't actually increase the amount of evil required between tier I and II, meaning that the first global tier up tune will still fire off at about the same time.  It's only after that milestone that Tuft Michael is played differently.
---
The point of my commentary on Myers was that he will do \*something\* to make his presence known in the first minute, even if it's only a global audio cue.  As for the effect of Tuft on my comment that Myers has already lost if you haven't gotten tier II by the first minute, you should see my following statement about snowball victories, which The Shape does excel at.
---
I'd also like to take this time to preempt a Mirror Myers argument by saying that you should already know if it's Mirror Myers by the offering screen, which is even earlier than the match itself starting.  In my experience, Mirror Myers players will \*always\* put in a map offering for either Gideon, Leary's, or Hawkins.  Also, Mirror Myers will also generally manage to get an injury in the first minute, unless they royally screw up their first ambush.
---
There's a special place in the Void for people who disconnect during the loading screen as well.
---
Mine is pig because for some reason they always tunnel me even though I have a reverse bear trap on and there's other survivors around.
---
So, a tall ghostface you arent supposed to look at. I like the idea cause my obsession in the past for the slenderman. Would love to just hear that tv static as a survivor when i look at him.
---
I hate when survivors run when I got the Botany + We'll make it combo it's pretty much an insta heal lol
---
I had five game’s today where survivors would do nothing but try to flashlight the killer for their challenge. They even purposefully got people killed. Just do they could try to flash. He said in the end he didn’t care about anyone or anything else. 
---
Then had a Freddy let us escape because he just needed to get hits. Then a ghost face let us win because he just needed pallet breaks. 
---
The challenges and daily quests ruin this game with the way they’re written.
---
I’ve been wanting new Adam cosmetics forever since he’s my main. He didn’t even release with a purple outfit. It’s so annoying seeing both Meg and Claudette get new outfits almost every chapter.
---
🍺😔🔦
---
4K =/= Merciless Victory. Pip system is a joke, you need a perfect game from a pip standpoint, meaning 9 hooks minimum, good chases, slow gen progression, plenty of hits. It's stupid, honestly. Survivors just simply have to escape. Killers, instead of just getting a 4K, have to beat the terribly implemented new emblem system and play an "ideal" game from the devs perspective.
---
Plague’s power hurts her emblems cause you essentially only hit survivors once to down them when they are sick and broken. Chase in half so less emblem points. Same with Pig if her traps kill survivors
---
Then dont crash 4head

There isn’t much of a reason to do it with killers since they’re already all different from each other.
---
Don’t lol
---
Thanks, I’ll get back on the grind with this in mind! I was worried something was just up with my game, but this should be enough for me to get the last few :)
---
I ran Surge for Mechanical Obsession.  I wasn't keeping perfect count, but I think Surge did end up getting me the challenge completion.

What would you do if it had a child right in front of you?
---
Interesting.... Not sure...
---
When that happends i start to look around my gen, only to see his ass was stalking me the whole time and i run for my fucking life.
---
It's ass in general. I don't get why anyone thinks anyone else would give a shit about their "new perk/killer ideas" or half of the other nonsense.
---
Honestly a second basement would be a cool offering
---
Stranger Things Map in a nutshell.
---
Should’ve used a condom
---
Great mind game!
---
Had this one game on PS4 where I was playing as teapper that made me quit the game for a month. I was using Ruin, Whisper, Franklin's, and BBQ, the same 4 perks I always use on him. I also had purple trap bag, and the difficult to escape traps on. 
---
There was a survivor who clearly wanted me to chase them, and came running up to me after I'd set a few traps. I mind gamed them into running straight into one of the 3 to traps I set. Hooked them near the traps and went to leave. 
---
As I'm leaving I see 2 others running right up, and one goes straight into one of my traps. Walked over, smacked the one, turned around, grabbed the other before they finished the unhook animation in my face.
---
 Now I have 2 slugs and one on hook. I let the slugs crawl away because I felt like this was toxic as hell and was questioning how stupid these guys are. I go looking for the last guy. Last guy unhooks first guy when I'm a distance away, so I come back and find and smack the last guy healing one of the slugs, right as first guy runs into the only trap I had left, so I finish chasing last guy, smack first guy again, and start hooking. 
---
Next thing I know I've got all 4 people spamming the shit out of me on PSN messanger calling me a toxic camper and tunneling and shit, meanwhile the match is still going on and I'm in the middle of hooking all 4 of them. 
---
They spent the next 45 min finding ways to spam me. I blocked them all, then they started spamming me on their alts, so I blocked them. Now two of them have apparently have yet more alts, so now I'm trying to disable all PSN messages and disable friend requests and notifications while still getting spammed by the other people as they make alts. It was a fucking nightmare. Quit DbD for over a month after that shitshow.
---
My favorite mind game is using iron maiden on billy or LF.  People always locker juke so its fun to make them exposed for it lol.
---
That's actually a really good question, they're going to run out of ideas real fast I would imagine.
---
I don't believe he dc'd. Should've shown it.
---
You are just getting *dedicated*. There is no way to fix this, just keep trying and hope it works, eventually.
---
Waiting it to blink
---
I have the same problem. Seems like killers like to grab the air for a second
---
Careful, they are pointing you with their downvotes for saying the truth
---
It’s so real it hurts.
---
And that's why spirit still be the best killer in the game
---
Uh oh watch out little timmy is gonna get his 4 friends to not play DbD
---
That would make the video another 40-50 seconds long mate..
---
First game I played with Claudette + botany knowledge perk and I started searching for herbs around the map to heal myself. I’m pretty sure I wasn’t the only one who did that lol
---
Edit it.
---
She wouldnt man.
---
and they take 0 time to put up with no cooldown.
---
I've never played this game, but is it really that unbalanced that the killer is to blame for certain strategies to win the game? I'd hate playing as the killer if it's my job to make people happy..
---
No, it was absolutely needed. Fuck off with this bullshit. People would DC in 100% of the games people tries this otherwise. I've already had games where I'd normally have DCs and I didn't. 
---
We've needed this for a long time. Stop being an idiot just cause you can't DC without penalty anymore.
---
or you can just deal with it because nobody cares if you dont believe they dc'd or not?
---
YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM HOST
---
Myers, Monitor and abuse. 
---
Ghostface.
---
Wraith, coxcombed and that other addon that blocks tr for 6s.
---
A Bill without Borrowed Time? That should be illegal 😂 Killers do this too often though, I'm glad it worked out for you!
---
I had a schoolgirl Spirit who was doing grab challenge farm with me for the Great Skill Checks challenge. 
---
I also helped a Trapper farm his challenge when I was doing the chest loot one. I left him a burrito because carrying around and setting bear traps just be hungry work 🌯
---
Then there's literally no reason to make changes as is since that's what the perk system does. As someone said before you're just suggesting giving survivors a 5th perk for free.
---
Nobody cares you got a flashlight save. But here we are.
---
I'm saying your argument makes no sense
---
Damnit now I have to change my steam username and equip only healing perks for the rest of the month...
---
I'm a GF main and I use his build. It's super good and you can get alot of 4ks with it. Highly recommended. The perks consists of:
---
Nurse's Calling
---
Thanatophobia
---
Hex: Ruin/ Corrupt Intervention
---
Sloppy Butcher
---
Worst time :(

I can agree that's completely the case , I have got soo many -reps on steam for those things xD

&gt;I'm saying your argument makes no sense

The argument is, you either wait for indefinite amount of time for a fair match up which might not even happen or you play against whatever the game can find. 
---
A lot of people complain about unfairness of matchmaking, saying they rather wait, which was the example I gave in my first comment. 
---
The other half, is you, complaining about queue times.
---
I still can’t get the teir 3 ones :/
---
i don't understand very good english so if you say the pink add on is scarh it is a lot
---
Did this one with Trapper in one go on Macmillan Estate.  Ran Agitation and Iron Grasp to haul, and put Discordance on to locate.
---
It's not impossible, but it's difficult.  Dark Sense survivor was tougher.
---
*Replace Meg with Claudette, then it's accurate*
---
if I play survivor I just try to loop the killer for as long as I can bc I find that the most fun.  
---
if I play killer I turn my brain off and chill  
---
did I do it right?
---
Yes that is what I meant.
---
Thank you so much for making me aware of this sub.
---
Yea
---
Took me 3 games with trapper for one survivor to finally let me trap them 5 times.
---
This is with me setting up two traps and just running into them while they gen rushed me in like 3 mins, lol.
---
Good to know one of my favorite animators ended up liking one of my favorite games
---
The real shit of it was I was going for my "2 sacrafices with NOED in the EGC" Rift challenge but this was such a better outcome, honestly.
---
If I see a farmer I just plain don't farm, Im so sick of lobby times, only to come across some Legion or Trapper asking Me if they could do Their mission or farm.
---
Did you just find out what a comma is? Sounds like you have the hiccups  😂
---
so yes it's really scary it's like the old prayer bead spirit but more easy
---
NERF ONI NERF ONI NERF ONI!
---
Agreed
---
That player sounds like a loser.
---
I really can’t listen to anything when playing. Survivor I need to hear the Heartbeat because I have horrible hearing. Killer to hear all the little details. Can’t tell you how many times I have found someone today because I herd them cleans a totem.
---
[Track source](https://youtu.be/wdT_rIba7PU)
---
Yea. But like man. Play survivor and listening to music is so much fun. Cuz you can still kind of hear but not that well. I was facing a wraith and had to turn it off tho cuz he was hella tunneling and camping
---
Make that a Bill, and it would be perfect.
---
Yes but the challenges for Rocketpass which gives XP towards the tiers can be done in a single match. If you have backlog of 30 challenges to do, you can progress all of them at the same time. In DBD you need to do 1 at a time.
---
It's been nothing but toxicity today.  The past three games were keys, coldwind offering, flashlights and endless tea bags.
---
It's like they dont get that they are at the advantage as survivor players so they get bogus egos from winning all the time at high ranks.
---
Dont get me wrong, I play surv just as much as killer, but it is way less difficult, which is why its dumb to get cocky about it.
---
Anyway... sorry about your sessions, fuck em.
---
Those pants made me think my eyes were messed up or something, never seen that many buttons on pants before lol
---
&gt;Doctor is only annoying to play against when you camp pallets
---
Doctor is annoying when he is in the map. The constant heartbeat, screaming, static on your headphones and even nonstop chase music if he has certain add-ons.
---
they could do a mine 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
no she isn't running noed but she is running rancor and i'm obsession
---
This. You have to complete them as fast as possible to move on to the next challenges so games are completely thrown just to complete a task because you need to do it this game. It’s making the immunity even more toxic than it already is. I came across so many insidious leather faces last level just because of the basement challenges.
---
Yeah, there's no way to hide your tag, but you can disable messages on PS4, but the issue is it takes going through like 3-5 menus depending on your security settings, so it's a like 5 minute affair if you know where you are looking. At the time I didn't. So while I was hunting for it, knowing it existed, the top left quarter of my screen is just being spammed with toxic as hell messages from them. Not everyone knows you can disable messages though. 
---
 I would keep them permanently disabled, except for the fact DbD isn't the only game I play. I play a lot of Destiny 2, and I actually teach people the raids in it, so disabling my messages just to play DBD means I literally have to spend 5 minutes every time I want to play DbD screwing with settings, then reenabling messages when I need to get ahold of the players I'm teaching.
---
I think if you could just work on more than 1 at a time it would be alright. Being stuck on one forever feels really brutal and takes the fun out of the game.
---
The problem is, it takes a long time to get some of the challenges playing normally if you don’t go out of your way to get them. And if you don’t do the challenges you’re not going to complete the tome unless you play literally all day every day.
---
If it's on pc I understand, but that's still unfortunate
---
(On dedicated servers you can perpetually stunlock wraiths)
---
I was going to say exactly this. Dwight and Claudette are in no way “boomers.”
---
Make sure it’s not a lunge, you can’t grab with lunges.
---
Nah I'm not
---
Yeah it's like ''waaa but i wanna camp the pallet waaaa'' well then you're gonna have a bad time..
---
loosely cat memeish but I wouldn't get that from this if someone hadn't said it
---
Well there are 3 default chase musics right now, I wouldn't be surprised if each one goes to the 3 OG killers or if it simply just cycles between them as it does currently if you're facing 1 of them.
---
The original chase music isn't bad anyways, so I know I personally wouldn't mind.
---
Exactly, I love playing doctor and shocking someone and you can just see the palpable button mashing. It's glorious.
---
Actually they have over 300 people working on this game. There’s 0 reason they can’t replace a couple files to put lights on hooks and lockers.
---
Toxic killer, down vote
---
*Bubba has entered the chat
---
Cheers for answering, and why do you say that?
---
Knowing Wraith's lore, this is very likely to happen. He would stay calm, and calm, and calm. And then he snap and meg a second axe out of that bitch.
---
Wraith. Trapper's power is incredibly counterable, gets in the way, and is RNG based. I say he is the worst killer in the game.
---
Wraith is worse ghostface who can move fast. So mid tier.
---
Terror radius
---
60k bp is too generous of a reward for that, 35k take it or leave it.
---
Probably more to-do with the fact he was repeatedly chainsawing the guy on hook. But yeah, people just don't like to hear that sometimes camping is the right move
---
Buff my boy legion behavior. According to Green Day, teenagers should scare the shit out of you!
---
ok lol
---
Thanks its probably my favourite trick to use on any killer.
---
I feel his power is underrated, as you can run a few addons to increase his speed and bone clapper and the mind games are strong. Where as trapper his powrr if yoj are paying attention is far easier to avoid.
---
Took me about 15 hours of play
---
I know they are farming. I just want to get the fuck out ASAP and find a real match
---
F for Soosie
---
on gens and totems that can be done yes but not on vaults
---
It would take all of 2 minute to replace a couple files to add lights to hooks and lockers and allow firecrackers. I’d take events again over the rift and tomes any day.
---
My party friends and I usually understand when atleast one of our teammates gets put into the basement. Obviously we still try to win but if we don't we won't be sore
---
Excuse me, what😂
---
The lvl 4 challenges are actually all doable. I did 3 killer ones in 45m last night. The survivor ones all look fine as well. The flashlight save challenge is harder than any of them except the Dark Sense challenge.
---
🐢
---
took me one video before i played the game
---
That title sure does look like some vine caption.
---
I'd probably have to not play killer for 2 months to get to greenranks to do it. the biggest issue is getting the 4th there.
---
First time I encountered Bubba after first encountering Billy.
---
That would be nice, it's why I 99% my heal when facing those if I have a medkit
---
A lot of streamers/DBD content creators are saying that Wraith is stronger overall which I also kinda agree being with the perks increasing it's value.
---
For Trapper, most of the perks are either to delay the game or can go full slug, though at the same time he is kinda dependent on his traps to end chases though compared to the wraith, it can get speed up and land a hit.
---
But which is the strongest killer? I would kinda lean towards wraith though it honestly depends on your playstyle. Which i do enjoy the Trapper the most the satisfaction of a survivor just randomly stepping on a trap in a middle of nowhere or just making a huge comeback which happens a lot.
---
Can I post this to my memepage with creds to you?
---
This is my new official favorite post
---
Ah, yes wanting to play the game is being a tryhard.
---
i consider wraith the best killer of all
---
For some reason, I thought you were going to get into a hatch and escape. But this is good also.
---
game streamers shouldnt even be a thing. games are to play, not watch
---
I usually just play Micheal with agitation and iron grasp and just start dragging them in the basement. If they try to escape when I'm about to leave, I'm going full tier 3.
---
😂 what was she thinking. That was great
---
I really don't know who's the villain in this.
---
i do all challenges in the first 1-2 days, but it gets it over with. surviving is repetitive anyway and rank is useless. its more fun to let the killer get u when the other 3 escaped
---
Survivor main here: Can confirm
---
Killer mains vs survivor mains
---
The Claud camouflage is working so it seems.
---
Mind-blowing you had to explain what means to be toxic in the game point by point. I guess people need to be spoon-fed the entire thing so they get it.
---
Wraith with bone clapper and a general appearance addon can be very unpredictable and can catch you in the most worse of situations his power can counter perks like BT. I don't really see any perks that would work as a good combo for wraith alone as an M1 killer he can use normal slowdown and nurses with sloppy to gain info along with Whispers that is just a good perk in general.  
---
I personally think Trapper is just as good but in a different area while yes u can counter trappers traps that don't mean they are useless bc just like wraith Trapper is good at being unpredictable, however, trapper would need at least yellow trap bag plus tar bottle which is green would be very good I think in general Wraith will be better with strong add-ons in purple or red but trapper doesn't really need purple or red yes they do help but they don't IMO give him anything that helps that much. Trapper is all about mid to end game pre-game is just about placing traps and then like poker getting lucky.  
---
Both killers can be countered by something like DH and OoO even DS but I think trapper can deal with DS and DH better than Wraith but ofc that heavily relies on the situation but for DS the survivors usual way of using DS on you is to bait u to grab since that denies the slug part but trapper can deny that like for example they jump in a locker? trap the locker boom easy. I also think Trapper can deal more dmg by blocking people in corners by placing a trap right under the survivor that can't move while all wraith can do is get one hit.  
---
But I think overall it is a matter of the match up
---
haha i have the ultimate strategy for this. use hex ruin, stand in front of it, facing it. someone comes to break it, grab them a bit after they started, once theyre invested enuff in it
---
When Bubba first came out, it was difficult to tell who was the killer in a distance being with the chainsaw mechanic making similar sounds. But overtime it was very noticeable until you see his yellow shirt lol
---
I haven't heard any info if such an option is coming or not but I guess you can hope  
---
*key word* ***I***
---
I swear this is the best haha
---
I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOUR RUIN POINT BUT I CAN SEE HOW THE RANK THING WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUEUE TIMES
---
from what I remember it shouldn't work but I guess I will have to wait for 50+ people to go scream at me that I am wrong bc it matters that much
---
[Happens a lot tbh](https://www.twitch.tv/oicmorez/clip/UnsightlyNurturingRingShazBotstix)
---
Seeking success = Entitlement...but yea I get your socialist viewpoint...makes alot more sense now why everything you say is wrong. May also be the fact that you refereed to yourself as "ours" in regards to survivors...signifies you are an "entitled" survivor main.

IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PIPS, IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE GAME LASTS LESS THAN 5 MINUTES BECAUSE IF YOU ACTUALLY DARE CHASE SOMEONE FOR LONGER THAN 30 SECONDS HALF THE GENS ARE GONE
---
I'd bring an Ebony for them
---
It is inaccurate and its not statistically significant...at all...you would know this if you ever took a Stats course in college
---
I think DCing is too far honestly. I mean yes, DBD did add a system to discourage players for dc but, if they really want to finish the rift then they will do it to other players regardless after you leave. So I would just get it over with and give them the challenge completion so they can move on. Same thing with killers being most of the challenges are duable but you do require help from survivors.
---
I've bullied killers before so it really goes both ways
---
Dwight boomed the gen.
---
As a killer main, that is fucking hot as hell LOL
---
Props to you and your tbag! Well deserved!
---
Dude
---
Lol im trolling, good mind game
---
I mean he is annoying. Annoying doesn't mean strong. But constant flashing, heart beats etc just annoy people
---
Wanted to try drawing some other games :)
---
They always give Meg dad butt it is just so sad.
---
Good...concede...its what your kind is good at. "Attack" Lol, wow...what a pathetic and soft generation to think anything I said was "attacking" geez...honestly I would be embarrassed. If the only way YOU can enforce YOUR opinion is by crying about it when someone doesnt agree with your idiotic points, then you SHOULD keep it to yourself...heh...liberals
---
...theres your "attack" btw
---
what a shocker at least it is something to do in the game now
---
As a killer main, i agree.
---
Where's the part where you gotta heal the survivors 20 times in 1 match without getting hit?
---
The Cannibal*
---
True that. It's almost as if theyre frustrated because they can't get out of gray ranks or something.
---
Sure thing, but please don't leave us like Valve just did..
---
See it all the time and I am rank 3...so yea. "shit players" yet ones that cant hit a great skill check everytime but can loop a fking killer for 3-5 gens...yea...they are "shit"
---
ignorance...
---
Lol we did and I ended up getting my head three survivors in a match but my team were stupid and didn’t listen to me about the killer until after and 3 of us died due to end game collapse trying to get my 3 heals 😂
---
I always knew the DC penalties was fake happiness and I am not happy about it
---
You got me 🤷‍♀️ and yeah it works so often and if it doesnt you only lose about 3 seconds.
---
Sooo good.
---
survivor mains...the same ones who play toxic as fk
---
Agreed. People may have a preference for different styles though, so in an ideal scenario where survivors are tagging in and out of chases you can still pick perks according to whether you're stealthy or aggressive. Roles are nowhere near as set in dbd as other games though.
---
You only mention one killer, the other is a meme
---
it works most people arent as observant. You can also see his yellow apron through the walls but you wont notice unless you go in looking.
---
You may not blame people for DCing because they're up against a decent Doctor, but I definitely do. I'm not entirely sure where the moral argument in favor of DCing comes from. You struggle to defeat him... so you just DC, lessening the experience for the 4 other people in your match?  
---
It just doesn't add up.
---
I would like to see the part where you teabagged the killer multiple times and played toxic...wheres that part or do we only get the out of context version?
---
Aww. Poor thing. You 3 were nice try and help tho
---
Don't feel bad. Had that happen 3x. Then get into a game. And hit a gen. BOOM Disconnect
---
Trapper cause he needs IQ, great reward for using your power well, devastating when countered. People saying Wraith because its simple and consistent, like nostalk GF. Downvote me you boring peeps
---
This is a very good point.
---
  
---
If you're not having fun, why do you keep loading into matches?
---
The basic gameplay of DbD is always the same no matter which killer or survivor loadout you are facing. Sometimes you're going to face kits that are tougher and more frustrating to go up against. If that is more than you can handle, the correct choice is to play a different game entirely.
---
Okay,  but yet not a single person on this whole thread has agreed with you yet lolololol. But keep coming for me,  and yes I am a survivor main but you're the one crying over not getting 4ks everytime but can call me entitled. Makes sense.
---
That happened like once per survivor at the start of the game, other than that it's rather unreliable to track them during the mid-late game with it as it was so slow to build up Madness, even with the addons it was painfully slow. Giving us a mechanic that can track anywhere from 1 to 4 survivors (because yes, survivors spread out on higher ranks so consistency is out the window) on such a hefty cooldown is not something i'm not a fun of.
---
Dont blame the survivors, blame the Devs that dont understand what a bad idea even if it slapped them in the face.
---
I keep suffering from technical issues with my pc and there's only 20 days left :((( I just want to play dbd, man. I paid for the chad rift pass and I'm only at tier 40.
---
Wiem, przepraszam. Spodobało mi się a moja krótkotrwała pamięć mówiła mi że już do ciebie napisałem, w rekompensaty mogę ci podarować jakieś karty steam żebyś coś zarobiła na tym bardzo przepraszam! Jeśli będzie trzeba to usunę
---
Flair checks out.
---
how is this leaked lore? it is just the lore books not even the last one we get in tome 4
---
yes. You can walk outside the map, fall down to the exit gate level and touch the escape zone
---
I rage when I get tunneled but when I play killer I purposely tunnel the first person just bc I know how mad it makes me
---
You legitimately said we ONLY have to do GENS,  which literally means you think that's our only objective and all we should be doing. So yes,  it implies you think all surviviors should do is gen rush since we don't "HaVe" to do anything else. 
---
Ruin is fine how it fucking is,  quit being a bitch. Lolololol. You're literally STILL on here crying,  even tho you're having games that you literally are doing well at IF you really are getting 3 to 4 kills per match. QUIT acting like you need 4ks every fucking game, this isn't just a game for killers or you'd have easy ass bots to kill. YOU don't have to "win" every game. Take your 3 kills,  and let the survivor get to SURVIVE sometimes.
---
MYC?
---
Gladiator match shouldnt be a thing. Battles are to be fought not watche
---
Lmaoo it does more than turn your camera bruh..it literally sucks you in towards them.
---
See and that’s kind of the issue with this game, it really pulls you in but it does that so well that when you really need a break it’s harder to see. I did the same thing, after a particularly frustrating killer game I sat back and was like “I’m not even having fun, this is a video game and I’m really not enjoying myself” and after that I took a break from the game for like a month and a bit, came back to it and felt less stressed when playing games
---
I’d have camped them just because the chances of finding any other claudette on that map is slim to none lol gotta take what you can.
---
There's also this challenge :
---
- **Dark Senses** - Completely repair four generators whilst using the Dark Sense perk in a single trial.
---
This is serious bullshit... You will never be able to do it without beiing 4 men SWF...
---
Most Tome 4 challenges require both survivors and killer to agree doing it together... Because I don't see how you could sacrifice 3 survivors during endgame collapse with NOED without survivor cooperating... Or maybe only ultra altruistic and dumb survivors...
---
The way they've implemented the system so far (i know it's just a test) is massive garbage, and will kill the game, this game crashes a lot for everyone
---
Close enough
---
r/beatmetoit
---
Just turn off the game man wtf
---
Just run from gen to gen and do them for a second. If you've done it with all gens, only 4 have to get done and you will get it. Maybe it doesn't count if the gen regress to 0 once.. But I got it on 1 match done and was surprised that it was so easy
---
A few days ago I had such a nice Wraith helping me with the flashlight challenge...  
---
He wasn't going easy on anyone and the match was quite hard for him (I assume) because his ruin was destroyed fast.
---
He downed a Laurie and I, the flashlight potato, ran towards him. He could have avoided the save, but he let me do it. I left him my flashlight afterwards (but Laurie stole it &gt;.&lt;) and thanked him on his steam profile. Both Laurie and me died either way (don't know about the rest).
---
I think I'll try my best to help killers get their challenges, too, if I can (no sandbagging other survivors tho).
---
That doesn't make sense at all. Due to this logic, the dc ratio should be 4:1 surv/killer.
---
Besides that, in my experience it feels like there is one killer disconnecting in like 30 games while average for 1 survivor is about 3-5 games and it doesn't matter if i play survivor or killer.
---
Okay but like, fucking chill bro ! i'm at the 3nd challenge how did you manage that geez louise
---
Expect a retaliation tomorrow
---
This companies isn’t a joke you are just too stupid to know how all of this works... on steam it’s easy because you could release almost everything on it but consoles are like the „higher class“ of games which only release like good and working games. There company isn’t as known as Ubisoft for example so it takes time until they notice that behavior send them a new update for the game and if even one little thing isn’t correct or doesn’t work they won’t get the update online so better think before crying around...
---
Rule #1 of this subreddit: Never call toxic any streamer that isnt Ochido
---
Well I'm not gonna deny it.
---
Flashlight save through corn ?! damn thats sick
---
It doesn't seem like a nerf to me.
---
He no longer has to move at 4.4m/s to increase Survivors' madness, the base Shocl Treatment Range is getting increased and one use of Static Blast in increase the madness level of EVERY Survivor within your terror radius.
---
The only thing that worries me is the cooldown. 60s for Static Blast is WAY too long and should be halved.
---
Ah, okay! I wasn't aware.
---
What is a tunneler exactly. Whats the issue with killing the easiest prey first?
---
I forgot to mention that it was the new Yamaoka's map (I dont know if it was clear enough since we're talking about that), I think it was the first day of release
---
Wait, it works?
---
It was my first thought but then I was like "devs made it not count as a basic attack tho..."
---
"buffs"
---
I LOVE THAT LITTLE TEABAGGING AT THE END
---
I know they currently can't heal or do gens in madness 3. Do you have a source for the rest?
---
I really do hate all the basement ones they're forcing us into. It's not fun for either side to camp the basement.
---
NERF LEGION
---
FIX DEAD HARD
---
BUFF LEGION
---
LEGION
---
Trapper 50/100 bc Trapper is all about luck tbh sure there is skill involved but that skill can be counted just by a dumb survivor that doesn't know how to effectively run a loop or a survivor that just misses a trap by that much.
---
Wraith 100/100 With bone clapper or the silent red clapper *I have forgotten its name* Wraith can be very scary and with the right playstyle, he can be very unpredictable making him strong.
---
Hillbilly 60/100 idk really bc even a dumb Billy that knows their chainsaw can insta down can still get a couple of kills but a skilled Hillbilly is going to 4k pretty much every game depending on the map.
---
Nurse what do I put for *"*skill doesn't matter it is the fucking nurse safety blinking is good enough for 2 kills" a skilled nurse is going to win any game it is at the point where it just matters how good the nurse is. at least imo. 
---
Hag 40/100 even a good hag can have a tuff time 
---
Doc 20/100 his shock to deny pallets and windows is inconsistent and hurts him in the long run even if u know how to do it
---
Myers 50/100 he has a insta down but is stil a M1 killer can be OP as fuck with the right addons and can be shit if survivors can just loop a M1 killer
---
Huntress 80/100 map depends
---
Bubba 40/100 just bc everyone expects u to camp as bubba that is the only thing that can help u but bubba is just a glorified M1 killer worse than billy bc he cant apply as good map pressure even if he has a insta down
---
Freddy 80/100 if u know where to TP and always have PGTW then ur good most of the time
---
Clown 30/100 his power helps him in chases yet he is trash idk how I am seriously confused how a killer with such a good power can be so trash but ig he has no map pressure
---
Spirit 100/100 requires no skill standing still is a mind game dont bother debating it with me u cant change my mind make her shards glow brighter when she is phasing thank u BHVR ur nerf did almost nothing 
---
Legion 40/100 can apply map pressure but that is all his power truly does but he can be fun playing
---
Plague 40/100 also as legion bc sure u can down people in 1 hit it is still a matter of CAN U CATCH THEM but if u get power then 80/100 bc it can be hard to use when u arent ready for it
---
Ghostface 100/100 I have gone against so many Ghostfaces that I am staring right at and it is not breaking them out seriously why though that is so dumb 
---
Demo 30/100 not much u can do basically a worse wraith imo
---
Oni 30/100 bc his nerf made his power stupid hard to use now thanks BHVR for not nerfing what needs nerfing or just QoL fixing  
---
I am 100% sure I dont understand the ranking system u wanted me to use but I tried
---
Balanced Landing should be activated if the survivor stepped down the stairs /s
---
conditions are here so you can't just use them all the time. deal with it
---
wow cool
---
Do you not use ruin because you dont have it or because you dont want to
---
if u are running in the direction u are looking then yes but reacting fast enough gets u far enough away from getting hit right away so I dont see the problem
---
*Time to farm baby*
---
I do this often.. But in purple/red ranks.. in green or higher I would worry if they suicide because they think I ignore them
---
I’ve seen many interesting lists with reasonings attached. 
---
Yours has to be the most interesting.
---
Wait a second, wraith with a blade? What is this heresy, why did you gave our bing bong boi a blade
---
Shut your mouth retard
---
I buyed this Tome, because I knew I will do much to finish this one. I was obsessed with the last charm. But now seeing how much times it costs to complete it, I choose to not buy the next pass.
---
I hope the next pass will not require so much grind, but I bet it still will be like this
---
Salty killer mains in this thread, hate to see it
---
Get a brain you dense cunt. Some killers are just pricks
---
Unless the killer is a trapper with Noed that takes 2 light years to turn around a corner
---
idk if that is a good thing or bad thing but I am not alone in what I am saying I can't be
---
Iam that guy. I fucking hate it when people farm. Its super unfun and a huge waste of time. For me, bloodpoints are not the goal of the game thus wasting 20 minutes on it is just not necessary. 
---
For me the goal is to have fun, escape the trial, help my fellow survivors,and not doing basically nothing for 20 minutes.
---
your change ideas are awfull. They just got rid of Forever Freddy, and you want them to introduce the Longest Legion Again ? 
---
There are tons of etter ideas floating around this reddit, some even make use of the Legion background. I think legion should just go for the full rework route, like freddy, because it is unfixable in this state.
---
ya but, of course 4 dcs shouldnt count 4 basement kills. It took the devs 3 days to code a 3 to a 2 I dont want them to try and code basement dcs as basement kills.
---
SO I FULLY REPAIRED 5 GENERATORS THANKS TO A SNOOP BOOP PIGGY. THEN I FORGOT TO PUT DARK SENSE ON. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU.
---
That's soooo cool, I would like to see that on the serum charm on level 70 of the rift too! Like the serum drips a bit
---
It’s a bad thing. 
---
Your value of wraith and ghostface are overrated and I think you’re a tru3 viewer who believes what he says about those two. 
---
As for the other killers. Some of your ratings and reasonings are just criminal. Billy at a 60? Plague at 40?
---
I love it. Plus sneaking the cat meme in the end, fantastic!
---
Feeling real world violence over a video game is totally rational btw.
---
That pallet one made me lose respect for the devs. Any player will immediately see the problem with it and they cant?

Jeez ok fun police.

I'll look at tier balance of the perks the way modern BHVR does
---
**Under the Mistletoe** 
---
Tier 1 is useless. make only the cooldown change with tiers
---
**Krampusnacht** 
---
No need to specify "your aura is hidden" when you gain Undetectable. Also, make only the amount of tokens change with tiers. 
---
Tier 1s should have \~70% of the tier 3 power. Sneak Peak is one of the perks that are still good on tier 1 so we can make an exception there.
---
My friends been streaming his killer gameplay to me over discord cause hes learning how to play killer. Waited almost 20 minutes for his first game since hes rank 20 and this happened to him. The pain is real.
---
I guess I'm confused but I thought the traps didn't go off after EGC started and they wouldn't go off for people trying to escape.
---
That's great, I've to try that!
---
The community is so split with the rift, like there’s one side who couldn’t give two shits about this thing an then there’s people who will move heaven and earth to complete their challenges. I’m only gonna care when it’s about a killer or survivor I actually like
---
In case you don't know, because many people seem not to, you have to be on 4 gens when they are completed. This means you still get credit even if you do 1% repair progress. It is much easier than it sounds. I did the lvl 3 one with 3 gens in solo Q on Thompson House in 1 try. 
---
To secure your chances, I would recommend...
---
-Bring a toolbox
---
-Get a swf group of 3 or more. This should make it much easier. 
---
-Farm (not recommended, but obvious) 
---
-Bring a map offering that is hard for killers (Coldwind, Badham, Red Forest, Yamaoka, etc)
---
Swf makes this the easiest, but it is not necessary. The moment you get a shitty killer map like Thompson House or Rotten Fields or Temple of Purgation, as long as you have a semi competent team and focus on gens, you should get this without too many tries. 
---
I actually really like the direction they took with lvl 4. The hardest killer challenge is 6 trapped survivors, which is still doable without farming, but is hard. Like it should be.
---
Mate. Stop getting defensive. You look weird. 
---
I have stated, my problem with your rankings is that they are not consistent and do not apply all things. I don’t care how you ranked them or if you did it incorrectly. I’m saying if you make a ranking, the parameters you use to rank them should be the same for all killers.
---
especially if you have we’ll make it
---
If any build, Wraith is better
---
If "most of the time" or at base, Trapper is better
---
Trapper is very strong when played correctly, has many unique mind-games with his traps, has add-ons that make his traps dark as fuck and has the only power in the game that works on its own even when you're carrying someone. He sadly still has to chase people, requires set-up time and can be sabotaged.
---
Wraith tho... He straight up has no power at base. You "choose" your power with add-on combos. The best one so far from the cheap ones, Yellow Bone Clapper, any Windstorm add-on turn him into a god, especially with an anti-healing build. One made by Tru3 is very good at red ranks. Ruin, Thanato, Sloppy, Nurse's. Sounds boring and cheap, but when played correctly it's very deadly. You don't chase, you uncloak, hit, cloak, leave, pick off when healing/working on gen injured
---
I don’t wanna be that person but I’m going to be. You got Legion’s story a tad wrong. Joey hesitated but stabbed anyway, Julie stabbed without question as Frank is her boyfriend and she followed anything he did and Susie didn’t want to but frank grabbed her hands and forced her to stab the janitor
---
Dead Hard requires you being injured state, it wouldn’t make sense to be able to use it while healthy as well
---
I don't understand "get good" if they are the ones who lost. Shouldn't they be getting good? I haven't played Killer though. Seems like most games of you lose and whine about it people tell you to "get good." Is it because they think you sew cheating?
---
Ah yes I'm not allowed to defend myself after someone trying to use "you probably watch Tru3" as a insult.
---
I'm done here say whatever u want I tried but I guess that's not allowed
---
...what?
---
So you want an analysis of killers in the top % of rank 1 gameplay?
---
We're talking about reliability and Wraith with a good build is very reliable, unlike Trapper which can get a shit map, can get sabotaged, can get outsmarted and still has to chase people
---
So u want me to go middle of the map and get hit by the killer so that u can start doing the gen at edge lol nice technique.
---
This is literally what they said they were going to do. It takes them so much time and testing to have seasonal events.
---
I like tru3. I have no problem with people watching. I said that you must watch tru3 if you have the exact same opinion as he does, as he frequently mentions how strong the two clapper add ons are. I made that a point because it would invalidate your rankings if you’re copying someone else. 
---
Hopefully you learn not to be defensive over nothing. Sorry for “riling” you up.
---
I’m honestly okay with it.  I want them to focus on gameplay stuff instead of more events.

If theyre mediocre and downvote them, if you dont want to see downvoted posts then browse hot.
---
I felt like sharing, dont think its every hour bro, if you have more mean shit to say i would rather not have to endure it, thanks.
---
People seriously don't understand generator priority it's so annoying that by the time there's 1 gen left there's still one in the center _and_ 2 other gens right next to it on the edge, next to an exit gate. Infuriating.
---
They don't go off if EGC is forcefully activated, e.g. shutting the hatch. Since they activated a gen, regardless of whether it was the last gen or not, the traps activated. And once active, it works like her old trap, making sure that you can't leave without removing them.
---
I’ve prestiged Legion to P3 simply because I main them and I’ve done the same for Nea and Laurie on survivor side for the same reason but apart from that I leave everyone at base level 50
---
that was me on the third tome with the spine chill challenge
---
They broke the entire lighting system this patch. Just look at Lery's and Haddonfield
---
but yea, about the new map... how do I mind-game when I'm not sure if I'm still actually chasing someone?
---
and no FoV settings
---
I had the same thing happen to me with hillbilly. Were you hit with a pallet and blinded at the same time?
---
Edit the comment.
---
You have to be injured to be grabbed WHEN VAULTING
---
That sounds like work
---
Want the most scummy way to complete the challenge? camp with doctor in treatment mode and spam m1. the moment someone tries to unhook, they get grabbed
---
YES, AFTER HOOKING EVERYONE IN THE BASEMENT, FINAL STEP IS HOOKING YOURSELF
---
We are not even sure if will keep it on PC to begin with.

Yh, whenever dedicated servers get added
---
i always liken DbD to heroin... you know its bad for you but you're addicted so you do it anyway... im in that boat but i finally got to a point where i only play sporadically throughout the week or on my days off and focus on other games mostly. lost interest in rift/archives, events haven't appealed to me recently. no worry about rank any more since they are meaningless (and hidden now how broken matchmaking is) its a casual game and thats all it ever will be but devs need to understand that and they never will.
---
As a killer I CANNOT kill Steves. Especially ahoy bois. Unless they’ve been a massive asshole then I will. 
---
As survivor (main) if I see someone teabag the killer for no reason I won’t save them.
---
I love the idea of static white noise being his 'lullaby' and have the static grow exponentially within the 8m mark. So 32-16 is pretty much the same 16-8 theres a small but detectable increase, and then when he's within that 8m you just know, but you can't look back.
---
Would be interesting as a whole as it makes mind games hard, and prevents 5gen chases, the teleport could also be gets teleported to XXm away from a random survivor, would be a different mechanic to the other teleports we have. little easier for new players, but not as powerful as stuff like Mint Rag Hag.
---
Well it's technically against the rules, I wouldn't be so brazen about admitting it. If he were to report you and recorded footage of you doing it, you'd get a ban for sure.
---
Next thing you know they add neon nea for meg
---
But the P3 heads look so cool 😔
---
NEVER FORGET THAT THIS SUB IS FULL OF HARDCORE FANS. YOU CAN CRITICIZE THE GAME,BUT THERE IS A VERY THIN LINE, ALMOST INVISIBLE AND WHEN YOU CROSS IT, DOWNVOTES ARE READY TO RAIN
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I ocassionaly drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Althought, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Just to clarify the ranking system:
---
A 100  rating would be a killer that when they are being used by someone highly skilled and who has taken the time to fully master that particular killer would be capable of killing all of a 4 man team every single game - when that 4 man team is the strongest swf red rank group.
---
A rating of 1 would be the complete opposite and 50 would be the middle ground.
---
So it's not a case of how much skill it would take so much as how much the potential the killer has in the right hands. 
---
This is the only way I believe you can debate which killer is stronger. Because for 80% of players Freddy may be the strongest but you take a killer like Nurse used to their full potential and then she may infact be the strongest
---
The only thing this Billy did wrong was attack you on hook
---
We could get something fun
---
but we got having to take a break from the game cuz everyone mistakes the game with a farming simulator
---
What problem?  
---
If it's "who the f\*ck thought it's a good idea to put it in the Red Forest when it has such a good potential" type of problem then I agree.
---
And your ugly, just like your mum
---
You don't have to be injured. Literally just get into a match and do some skill checks.
---
You don't have to be injured. 
---
I used Stake Out to complete it.
---
why would people not be happy that people who are leaving the game are getting punished?
---
makes no sense why you would praise somebody for dcing
---
I will miss the creepy Christmas music they had for it the music was dope ( the menu music I mean)
---
This is so cute.
---
Look, at the end of the day it's not comparable. Survivors are part of a 4 man team. If you get bullied, either the killer is wasting their time and helping out your team, or your team will come help you. There's always a benefit.
---
If killers get bullied, with flashlight clicking and teabagging, it's ONE person being treated poorly for no reason and there's nothing they can do.
---
Playing killer is harder than playing survivor, simply because there's so much that you have to DO. Survivors are just spending a lot of time hitting skill checks, it's not comparable at all. And yet I've had games where there's a SWF team who are clearly much higher rank than me, that have clearly decided that they want to 'be a dick' as much as possible. And I can't even share that experience with anyone and nobody can help me, I'm by myself.
---
Dont camp pallets, if a killer is coming at you see how far you can run before you go to a pallet/layout. Bring Spine Chill to peace out early. You will eventually go down provided the killer isn't beyond stupid so think of it as stalling for your team.
---
Perk doesn’t need to be activated, just equipped.  On one of the previous levels that’s how it worked anyway.  I also am combining This Is Not Happening with the Tapp perk Stake Out.  Also use item add ons that increase skill check success zones.  Any skill check counts as well so healing, repairing, sabotaging all count towards it.  Good luck on the challenge.
---
I'm not sure. I think it's cumulative total progress, like the trophy on PS4. So it's based off of 1000% total repair progress, not like the Dark Sense challenge.
---
They can see your aura, you can know the direction they are coming from (perk icon lights up)
---
All the way in...No mither+TINH+Iron will+Resilence
---
Watch some YouTubers/streamers survivor play and take notes.  Pallets aren’t the only way to avoid killers.  Certain structures and vault locations can be better than pallets.
---
Could easily be both but whatever
---
It's funny how winners are called toxic. If survivors destroy you then cheers they have the right to brag about it. If a killer 4kd then they have the right to brag about it. Here's what's toxic, Keys, Moris, Adrenaline, NOED. farming, sand bagging, camping ( end game camping is fine ), tunneling. That's it, humans are here to prove themselves.
---
Woo! Well done. Fuck that killer, he was totally mocking you and showing off with that chainsaw move. I once got hooked by the wraith and he camped me two gens in and just kept banging his bell in front of my face... I was furious. No one could get to me but at least my teammates had more time. Unfortunately I wish I had the skill to serve his karma just like this...
---
It is difficult to give ang advice without any footage or information on the map you were playing. You are complaning about lack of pallets and how unsafe they are but apart from few maps, many maps have plenty of safe pallets.
---
Stakeout and sabotage some hooks. Got over 20 greats that game..
---
Removal of stance switch is HUGE. It lets you actually zap the windows. They also increased the base zap range and removed add-ons that were very bad but looked good, which tricked people into using them (range for cast time)
---
One person's game being ruined is the same as another person's game being ruined. Dicks are dicks are dicks, mate. It's not survivors vs killers, it's people who try to enjoy a game vs assholes that just try to ruin it for everyone. The problem is killers are more likely to run into an assholes as they have 4 opponents who could be dicks, compared to survivors who only ha e one who could be a dick. But at the end of the day, a ruined game is still a ruined game, whether you're a survivor or a killer.
---
Bro, at over 1,900 words, this is literally three times the length of a newspaper editorial just to say you're done playing a video game.
---
I agree about the DC penalties though. I desperately wanted them, but it's already clear they're a complete disaster. Tome farming + DC penalties is the perfect storm of misery.
---
Any tips for new-ish killer mains?
---
I believe that one is full progression. You don't have to 0-100 the same generator, but you need 100% progress across any number of generators.
---
No, it's not the same. Because a survivor can just do their best and peace out once they're hooked. A killer is stuck in the game. Literally nothing they can do. I've been blocked in while carrying a survivor while survivors teabag and flashlight click. Killers CAN have four people obviously BMing them at the same time. It's not possible for that to happen as survivor. 
---
I do agree though that it's not 'survivors are toxic', it's just that it's actually a PROBLEM when you're a killer rather than just a slight inconvenience.
---
Killers are treated like trash. People forget that they're people too. 'He's the enemy' so you can BM. If you outplay the killer, BM. If you die, message him saying 'learn to play'. If you don't die, message him saying 'LOL EZ learn to play'. It's fucking disgusting. I've received messages saying that I should kill myself. And on top of that, if the survivors think that they should AUTOMATICALLY get the hatch because they're the last one alive.
---
Nope. That's what I thought, but I looked at his perk in the end game screen there was no Monitor. Happened a few games after that one too.
---
So fucking annoying, just play the game.
---
Don't call me bud weirdo
---
This game is balanced around swf groups. U either play swf or play a killer that can deal with swf. And I say that as someone who played 99% of the time as a killer in the past 2 months
---
if your response had nothing to do with furries, why mention them, dipshit
---
ok bud
---
Very original
---
Tenacity instead of iron will
---
Poor Wraith needs a raise, this is a whole load of bullshit to have to deal with for the rest of eternity.
---
Oh damn 20 days? I’ve gotta start playing
---
I think that was lag. She was just running straight since your game wasn't getting her input. The disappearance was her jumping back to her position.
---
Well fucking done my dude
---
Dont have it yet
---
You get the birds if you roleplay so hard as survivor that the game says youre just hiding too much. A good example is if you sit in a locker too long, those birds tell land on you to help the killer get you.
---
No, I'd rather watch paint dry for how boring that experience is.
---
It’s pretty awesome. Loving the slugs lately
---
Accurate. Survivors nowadays are ridiculous, just had a Feng saying ''Ez f*cking baby killer'' after dying on her third hook. She also complained about my Whispers and said its OP.
---
Because they don't want to be punished for disconnecting themselves.
---
Now if only there was another way to avoid the penalty...
---
Question. Why do you like the Doc ?
---
Omfg PLZ
---
Where is this from? What site ?
---
Tena+Unbreak+No mither+ what else? Thats the proper slug surv build
---
Borrowed time. Need a reason to be slugged
---
I try to play all killers, cycle them around. I enjoy the variety and so do the survivors, instead of just spirit, nurse and billy
---
See you dont realize that killers can be worse than survivors at times with camping tunneling nodding etc so you saying no one fucking cares is an opinion so far up your own ass that those “toxic” survivors shouldnt stop playing the game,you should im not taking survivors sides there a pain in the dick sometimes but you coming in straight up saying fuck you if you dont play the game like i want you too is a bit self centered wouldnt you agree?
---
BT
---
There’s a weird bug (as usual) in the game where sometimes, a survivor gets mid-hook. It disconnects the actual player but the match doesn’t register it, and instead makes them AFK. Even if other survivors have died or escaped, the game won’t end unless the endgame has been triggered.
---
True i mean other Games can handle it and it is not like they are a small Group of devs... its a big company
---
Hex: Huntress lullaby
---
I misunderstood your question partly, but what i like about doc is how you can manipulate where the chase goes, switching to punishment is super quick so i can shock them then immediately switch to punishment and hit them when they cant vault or drop pallet
---
Next time, just send the salty dudes a smiley face. It makes people seethe more than anything. If someone is being toxic it's probably really easy to piss them off more than you're getting annoyed.
---
Just played in the farm map, besides the truck, there was practically nowhere to run and so i died. The killer simply, inevitably caught up.
---
Freddy, spirit, trapper.
---
Trapper can shut down loops, end chases immediatly with well placed traps early game and scare survivors off certain loops like killer shack. Trapper also makes survivors play less optimally due to the fear of loops being trapped. He also has a very strong basement game and can win games out of nowhere if survivors mess up.
---
His weakness? He literally has to give up 1 or 2 gens to set up and this set up phase can be interrupted by survivors coming across him and disabling his traps. SWF is also a counter to trappers many advantages.
---
Wraith is a pretty straight forward killer, he is very good at finding people and getting an early hit. Unfortunately he is not so good at getting downs because he has no chase ability. With certain add-ons he can be quite the trouble-maker, however at the end of the day he is still a M1 killer and therefore slightly worse than Trapper.
---
Having violent thoughts over a videogame is fun?
---
Ah ok thank you very much
---
Thank you friend
---
Send help
---
They actually brought this up in the DEV stream today.  No.  It’s never going to happen. That gives WAY too much information. 
---
This game was meant to be solo survivors working together. No swf. No mics. Nothing.  They implemented that much after they came out with the game.  The devs still want to make us feel uncomfortable and expect the unexpected despite all of the changes.
---
Ngl she looks so cute on the third panel
---
I cri
---
Nobody, I don’t even remember why I mentioned it in the first place tbh.
---
Hahaha that's what you get you camping ass!
---
You are WAY too late to the party, the level 4 challenges are actually great
---
Did you expect them to save you with Michael in Tier 3 or no? Kinda hard.
---
&gt;What do we think about adding kindred tier 1 to base survivor kit? Or do killers think it would be too op?
---
Just a FYI, doesn't really matter what we think, devs have said (twice now) that they won't be adding it to base kit. 
---
Personally, I think it would be alright for solo players but a "fine tuning" that would make SWF even stronger. I play DBD with 3 casual friends and is not rare that we run into each other while one is looping the killer and the other is supposed to go for a rescue.
---
I wouldn't mind base kindred as a killer and would love it as a survivor but there are definitely issues with it. Kindred is just too strong.
---
15 min queue + 5 min loading and then this... \*RAGE FACE intensifies\*
---
As a survivor main, i think this will be op. I play on PS and its quite surprising to see how many games i play where no one has kindred as one of there perks. Is this one of the reasons your asking?
---
I think that would be a bit too much I already think the fact survivors can see when someone gets trapped by trapper is a bit much but that is a different topic
---
please just stop
---
It's definitely not affected by perks, only addons. I'm not sure what the radius of it is, probably the same as her terror radius.
---
Coming 2020: Killer Battle Royale.
---
Sir, did you mean to respond to my comment? I didn't mention disconnects anywhere in my message. My message was focusing on the idea of a casual mode.
---
Now make Harry barely visible in the corner and call him ghostface
---
It’s painfully relatable
---
that sounds so self destructive, unproductive, and annoying, jesus
---
Jesus christ you're a typical reddit user if you dont understand comparisons.
---
I said people like dumb shit like furries so her cringe could absolutely be liked.  Reading comprehension you insufferable virgin.
---
Fuck, i dont wanna play as quintin tho
---
How are you supposed to do 4 gens in one match? Doesn’t that rely on your three teammates not doing any gens? I’m confused
---
I did try Google docs but couldn't figure it out. I'll probably try a notepad and post the full thing later (I'll take this one down)
---
I dont mean to be a asshat it just seems redundant
---
growing up is just a lie of people who forgot how to have fun Ü
---
Just wanting to start a discussion and see what people think.
---
Ironic
---
- Solo queue
---
- Wait 20 minutes to find a lobby
---
- Finally find a lobby
---
- 3 other Survivors load in at the same time and the killer thinks you're SWF
---
- Killer Leaves.
---
Every Time :(
---
nope. Everyone has the same. Only tier 1 myers, tier 3 myers and post-blink nurse have different lunge distances. On top of that, speed increases (other than the base movement speed) increase the lunge distance as well (but only because you move faster. Attack hitbox stays the same) 
---

---
The killers just gunna face camp you till your stage 2.
---
Sooooo.
---
Nurse is the best still but ok
---
They‘d have it on same prestige lvl most likely
---
pff hell no
---
Imagine omplaining about BNP in 2019
---
**Rampage** should always last 25 seconds and have a 60/50/40s cooldown
---
**It’s Alive** seems like a reverse pop, where you kick the gen first and then hook. Might be decent
---
**Undead Strength** I'd change the scream bubble length to match **Infectious Fright**. 4/5/6 seconds
---
It's easy you're just bad sry
---
Imagine wanting new abilities in a Survivor's kit in 2019
---
I stopped counting how many times it pissed me off that I couldn't try to kobe
---
Seems like this game takes one step forward and an entire flight back
---
I started Doctor. He takes a hot second to get used to, but once you do he feels great. 
---
I would recommend trapper, good area control
---
Nope. They instead focus on Extreme balance and trying to treat the game as if it was a competitive tournament-ready Esports game. Just let it be what it was originally supposed to be. A co-op asymmetric horror Survival game. If they keep trying to make the game tournament-ready... It will just become more and more frustrating and unbalanced.
---
Maybe I just need a decently long break. The no winter solstice thing has crushed me though. It's my favorite event and I was looking forward to it so much. Lately they've been skipping out on events and just putting stuff in the rift in its place, and if that's the way the game is heading I don't like it.
---
I started with leatherface for his teachable perk bbq  and chili.. It's a very good perk for a beginner killer that helps you farm bloodpoints faster.. Then after getting that it's up to you :) just get it first..
---
There are no anti-tunneling perks in the game. There are however FIGHT ME BITCH perks that can also stop tunneling sometimes, but also make the killer want to activate them (hit the unhooked to make them mend, take the unhooked out of the locker to not have to deal with ds in the end-game)
---
The archive challenges don't actually expire, the Rift does. If you finish a challenge that has been released in the past, the rift fragments will count towards the current rift. The only thing you can miss out on are the rift rewards, but the challenges will remain in the game even after the rift has expired, in case someone wants to see the lore but didn't have a chance to play at the time.
---
If they're put on after the 5th gen, then no. If they're put on before the 5th gen pops, yes.
---
Thanks. I'm glad not all of the comments are negative. Honestly I do need a break. Those of you who are recommending that are totally right. Sometimes taking a month or two off the game can do wonders for your mind. This game is incredibly unhealthy in large doses.
---
It has always been broken. Sometimes you reveal them across the map when not seeing them, sometimes they stalk you by standing in the open and you can do jack shit about it
---
I want to post this on Twitter and tag John Wolfe. Do you have a website or something so I can give you credit?
---
I knew that halloween cosmetic would pay off
---
I hate farming. I want to actually play the game the way it was intended. Matches the killer decides to farm, I just get away from them and do gens.
---
yeah because that always works. its not like good nurses exist that can mindgame you
---
Yeah I get that, even if the events only added some new cosmetics they still made the game feel more festive and a little different for that season. I don’t particularly see the rift as a replacement and I don’t think it should ever be that, the rift should be it’s own thing without crushing any other features
---
Trapper definitely! He is a very strong killer who can easily take you to purple ranks
---
My Twitter is @cute_c3. So please credit that. Also I already posted this on my Twitter, could you repost it from my original? Thanks :D
---
But it is “my friend”
---
I pointed out that a rational person doesnt get violent thoughts over a videogame. Do you believe this statement to be false?
---
That was unexpected
---
Don’t play doctor, he’s really weak and also getting a rework, so no point learning.
---
You are arguing with someone who makes shitposts over a stupid comment. 
---
**or you are that nea in the picture wich in case..**
---
Fuck off truetalent
---
I Ran This is Not Happening, Resilience and No Mither. The fourth one was Dead Hard but it didn't really make a difference.
---
I used a toolbox with an emphasis for sabotaging hooks. Then I just went and sabotaged every hook I could find. Man, that Billy I ran against must've been pissed. Three of us escaped that match :)
---
How is it your bane? Do you know what that word means?
---
Dude I legit get mad as survivor when I save someone and they do this. I love running a build that's a super saver with:
---
Borrowed Time
---
We'll make It.
---
X Perk
---
Medkit.
---
When I save them and want to speedy heal they just..... run off. I die inside each time and if it happens 3 times it's a hatch game in my mind.
---
I'd say not bubba if new people already think camping seems smart at least with wraith they learn that's a bad idea with bubba it's more likely they will get more kills bc they camped and get the wrong idea
---
You only need to pop the gen
---
not my fault if a killer decides to chase me for 4m without breaking chase.
---
How the fuck do you do the four survs one basement challenge?
---
The head looks like a sour raisin, the weapon is bigger than wraith and the legs are like bread sticks
---
Pretty much whenever a killer runs it I'm I'm cought out like a noob in the basement trying to go for that chest
---
I'm honestly not looking forward to that challenge
---
Play doc with unnerving presence, distressing, overcharge, and huntress lullaby with "calm" - carter's notes and "order" - caters notes on the game map.
---
Think of it as Predator on Spirit or Shadowborn on Nurse. It's a training wheel for a sense that's acquired later in their lifespan.
---
Honestly a big tip for this is to just ask the survivors if you're on PS4. Had a GF message my friend and I earlier asking if we would help him get it. We agreed under the condition he would let us do some gens and get to the end of the game. The other two survivors willingly did it as well, although to make it easier on him we didn't save the other two just incase they decided to backstab him. Even though we were both working on challenges that focused on escaping, we more than willingly complied. My tip? Look for 4-3 man SWF. Ask and try to sweeten the deal with BPS or just farming in general. Honestly the willingness of Survivors and Killers to help one another get challenges is so strong. It's such a wholesome community sometimes, and definitely my favourite. Because even if I got tunneled and facecamped 3 games in a row, helping a stranger get something done which they've worked on to no avail is so much more satisfying. :) A true act of goodwill always sparks another. &lt;3
---
Oh
---
Lol
---
Next to all high rank Hags run Monitor and Abuse tho
---
Wait what, let me check that shit real check
---
I love it on jumpscare Demogorgon.
---
Yes and my trapper lol
---
Jesus Christ some of you are so fucking weird and desperately need a fucking life
---
I’m pretty sure these weren’t even the first versions, correct me if I’m wrong
---
I can't wait for BHVR to fix Borrowed Time against killers with no terror radius. This shit is depressing to watch. 
---
I loved playing **against** Scratched Mirror Myers and this change ruined this build for me because all we get now are campers hiding behind a wall while seeing everyone's aura. 
---
I know you are not using this build but you are sitting in EW1 which is basically the same thing, just missing the "wallhack".
---
oh god, why?
---
For real...its like you feel naked out there and subjected to jump scares lmaooo
---
Wraith will teach you how to not rely on your power
---
Leatherface has a perk that doubles your bloodpoint gain
---
Trapper, Agitation, Iron Grasp, Deerstalker, BBQ and Chili.
---
Get a trapper bag and coils for setting speed.
---
If you can, offer the hazy reagent to make it harder to see traps.
---
Find the basement ASAP, setup traps around the walls and the immediate surrounding area ESPECIALLY pallets. DO NOT place a trap on the doorways/stairs to the basement.
---
If you can, try to push the survivors to repair all the gens except the 3 closest gens to the basement. If you 3 gen them, the challenge is basically yours.
---
Finally, once you hook 1 person in the basement, the rest will follow soon. From here the next move is up to you - but make absolute sure you slug the 3rd last survivor, drag them to the basement but don’t hook them, and then go find the 4th. Last thing you want is to sacrifice 3 survivors in the basement then have the last one escape through hatch.
---
That’s it. You can also try deranking if it’s too difficult but that was the best strategy for me. Got it first try. It also works for the “hook 6 survivors in the basement in one trial” challenge.
---
Huh?

but that means you're nowhere close to sounding like Hag

Level 4 was leaked a while ago right? Not sure but I think they already changed some of these
---
I was unaware they gave that back. Glad to see it's working as intended.
---
This is by far the most pathetic essay I’ve read here and I’ve read a lot of pathetic essays here

I guess. It would make more sense to have him talking about his friend if Baby Yoda were looking at the Mandalorian[which is designated as the friend], but he's not. Baby Yoda's attention is directed at people in the distance.
---
This has an unspeakable about of spite, I can tell
---
Where in my post did I say "high rank hag"?
---
User flair checks out lol
---
They should make it take longer to mend. And make the wound timer shorter.
---
well clearly they couldn't hear the beeping sound of the RBT's so I'd say they didn't notice the RBT's because they didn't know how hear traps worked.
---
I'd say Wraith but if you rely on your power too much, you might have a hard time playing non stealth killers. 
---
Doctor is a good start though I think. Watching videos and practice is the best way to get better no matter the killer imo.
---
It's not. your husk's terror radius is always 32m
---
In this game I think I had filthy blade and Legion pin although he could of just sprinted off and mended.  I really hope DW gets reworked cause I'm pretty good with legion to the point I apply deep wounds to people multiple times in one power usage
---
The leak wasn't completely true as most were just placeholders for the actual challenges. Like level 3, some didn't make it an to the final version in level. After level 3 got a lot of complaints, they actually changed them. The same would apply for 4, placeholders with some real stuff then the actual level 4. A lot of people, including me aren't happy about some of level 4 and I hope they change some.
---
I don’t have leatherface is he dlc?
---
HE IS TOO DANGEROUS TO BE KEPT ALIVE
---
Sorry for overestimating your skill then
---
Ah, k. I just don’t know why they can’t just fuck off with the basement missions
---
What can u even do for legion anymore their whole power is a problem for the game the whole concept just pop a cap in their head and put them out of their pain
---
Honestly at this point they should just change legion entirely...  cause as soon as you do that he is OP but right now he is good in situations but against 80% of survivors it's more of a nuisance than a threat.
---
just doing my job :)
---
It literally shows the reward when you open the archives lmao
---
Soon as I read that I laughed lol
---
this is so cool ! does it blink ingame tho ?
---
Base kit? Fuck off
---
Would highly recommend Otzdarva if you're wanting to watch videos.
---
&gt;BBQ -&gt; removed aura reading + basekit
---
As if people didn't complain about campers enough. BBQ exists to help survivors by giving killers a target far away from the hook. It already sucks that they added lockers as a counter.
---
Yeah.
---
Shit, I just noticed that one. 
---
Well, that's not really...cool. Another challenge that isn't based on killer skill, but on survivor mistakes. That's definitely the hardest one, then.
---
The trap still needs to activated by a gen being repaired. Back then it didn't matter
---
Exhaustion perks have changed a lot over the years as what is meta.
---
BT hasn't been meta for that long at least what I remember
---
BBQ is hardly meta. Nor is it the best tracking perk for killers that imo is whispers.
---
Hex perks don't need to be nerfed if BHVR balanced gen time around the better players of the game plus who uses anything but hex ruin anymore like the other perks are fun but RNG if they are going to be effective or not
---
Legion is what brought me back to the game as it seemed like such a fresh power.  Then legion got gutted. The problem is they nerfed him and gave nothing back it's blatantly obvious they don't know how to balance the power so they keep nerfing stuff that synergies with it.  Legion is fun for me cause I love running around applying pressure.  Like I understand I can't down people but I have a pressure phase then a phase were I find them with nurses and down them.  That to me is the only method for legion and at that oni is kinda better at applying similar pressure so oh well
---
I also think u can’t bring offerings or addons but I am not sure
---
UNFORTUNATELY YOU HAVE TO HALF PLAY LIKE THAT AS KILLER AND ENSURE A KILL FAIRLY EARLY OR THE GENS GET DONE TOO FAST
---
You had to wait like ten minutes on an infinite. I started scrolling then it happened
---
DEPENDING ON YOUR RANK THAT SEEMS ACCURATE.
---
I HAD TWO SURVIVORS DC AGAINST MY TRAPPER, I LET THE TWO OTHERS FINISH THE GENS BECAUSE FUCK THAT SHIT. THEY LET ME GET MY MASTER CHALLENGE AND BLACK PIP, PLUS WERE SUPER NICE IN CHAT, WAS WORTH IT.
---
Damn guess I’m not playing him wish the game had a season pass
---
Oh I thought you meant it’s your bane as a killer and I think the people upvoting you thought that as well because conventional wisdom here is that it’s not a good perk
---
My buddy was being chased through like 3 gens 1 day all while having deep wound on and when he could finally mend the game lagged and downed him. His screams were hilarious
---
Rank 2 trapper 
---
*moving on*
---
Yup they seem to forget *they're* the Killer's objectives.
---
Hugging gens is ok, hugging survivors, not so much. :(
---
Probably 400 hours, I’ve got most of the good perks.
---
In what universe are BT and BBQ not meta
---
You were in the upside down as nancy, it should unlock an achievement
---
Read the flair
---
Theres a steam sale today if you're on PC. I'd say he's not needed though tbh. BBQ isn't needed and there is better killers but I'm not saying he not fun.
---
no
---
Deep wounds is a joke because of stuff like this I would honestly rather a longer power gauge and no stun after coming out of it than deep wounds so I can use it as traversal and getting injures.  Like bruh why he so weak but I'm too edgy to give up on him ahhhh
---
Amanda, dat u?
---
Console and who was your first
---
I never said BT wasn't meta I said it hasn't been meta for long. 
---
And BBQ is just good for BP I never run it I'd rather have whispers bc it's just much better at tracking
---
What? That’s one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard. Only brain dead survivor mains would think it’s a decent idea at all
---
Some killers play in a rather annoying manner, and some survivors will complain when they lose and trashtalk when they win. The game is not the main issue here, even though it could punish poor gameplay more harshly
---
That isn't countplay in the sense you use it in Spirit's context though. These things aren't beating the killer no matter what. It has a risk to it, it can be prevented by the killer, the time to waste it can be used, Ghostface can juke the reveal etc. All those things are stuff you *can* do that will help against them but also have a chance to not work out for the survivor.
---
Spirit already has that. You can juke her. Phasing from anywhere but directly behind a survivor (unless they're injured) has an inherent risk to miss a juking survivor. That interaction of "Can work, but doesn't have to" is inherently built into her ability. 
---
Counterplay, if you wanna use it in this context, 100% exists. If you mean hardcounters that 100% are safe and have zero option for opposition to circumvent, no matter the skill (like, ironically, a bunch of pallets present on all maps) shouldn't.
---
I'd like garbage pals to get a decent rework like fred boy got. Legion is an awesome killer with trash power now
---
I started Wraith and still main him now. I then mained The Shape (Myers) but he's DLC too.
---
I started Wraith and still main him now. I mained The Shape (Myers) for a bit but he's DLC too.
---
Fuck no, your high as fuck for suggesting this. Part of the risk of going for the hook is you may of wasted time since someone else may of gone to it first/as well wasting your time. Part of the risk of not going for the unhook is that the others assumed you would. Part of the risk of going for the unhook is that the killer may be proxy camping the hook getting you killed.
---
Kindred, especially post change is a great perk. Making any part of it base game, MAYBE beyond "if a killer is within X meters of the hook for 20 seconds reveal them", breaks the game.
---
so you are in the high ranks, so you are in fact nowhere to sounding like Hag ;) ok I'll move on
---
What you personally prefer has nothing to do with whether BBQ is meta. Sorry, but you’re not that important 
---
And BT has been meta fucking forever. Especially old BT
---
Prestige is just good if u want to complete all characters fully the bloody items are cool but if u aren't in for the long ride it's not worth it and I've heard NOT A FACT HERE PEOPLE OKAY I've heard that the % increase for rare items isn't that high to be worth it AGAIN NOT A FACT 
---
I'm saying not a fact bc last time I spoke from personal experience people said that wasn't allowed smh
---
have a cap reached when prestiging if you want to, but I personally don't do it. I won't use the cosmetic anyway
---
was on the shrine last week, you could of.
---
no NSFW? bold of you to post nudity there
---
Do you even read? I said I don't remember if BT was meta or not I'm not a wiki page chill.
---
And I've not seen BBQ in forever at rank 8 Survivor at least.
---
You don't need to act like a dick about it
---
kind of late but thanks lol
---
There that's called a critique, this is where you point out what someone needs to work on. Like your fucking attitude.
---
If I’m against a one shot killer, already injured , or exposed you damn right imma loop  next to that hook lmao.
---
DS obviously. At minimum it makes him scared of DS because someone is an obsession to give him a reason to slug. But you already fucked up by running no mither because they know you can endlessly pick yourself up so they will just eat the DS
---
The pin rework was a nice addition.  I feel maybe if that was standard and built in like breaking people could maybe be alright and not too OP since he gets stunned coming out the power but meh.  Either that or maybe it takes another person to mend your deep wounds but you can stop the timer temporeraly by doing it yourself. Forcing survivors to group up making it easier for you to apply deep wounds.  That's my personal favourite as it fits the style of quick rushes of attacks
---
I agree with bubba, people say he has no skill cap, but i disagree.
---
No other killer depends on mindgames, zoning and positioning like bubba.
---
Becoming good with bubba makes you good with all M1 killers in the future
---
Hate that shit. If you're not going to play - uninstall.  If you need bloodpoints so badly then play the game and get better instead of wasting everyones time including your own.
---
I loved your TF2 animations! So happy to see you on DBD now! :D
---
The best time to prestige would be when you can quickly get the character you prestiged to level 50 again. That would be with the upcoming Bloodhunt on January 2nd. I suggest you keep 1million bloodpoints and then you prestige so you can get to around level 38 so you have chances to unlock powerful perks and start immediately playing with that character. The only advantages are the bloody cosmetics (for killer it is weapon for p1 then body for p2 and head for p3) and the higher chances at the bloodweb although it seems to be quite impercetible
---
I had to keep my eyes open the first time I saw it happen when I unlocked it to make sure I wasn’t seeing things.
---
Prestiging does 2 things. Its unlocks the bloody cosmetics? And it increases the chance to find rarer items in the blood web. If you genuinely enjoy the game despite all the toxicity surrounding it, then prestige your characters. If not, then it may not be a great idea. It's all up to you, but if you're going to prestige, I recommend having to survs or 2 killers at level 50 before prestiging one of them. That way, you have a level 50 to play around with.
---
Dead by Wait times
---
No survivor main, and  I didn't say it's a good idea nor a good perk, only said I like the basic idea of it. Not the implementation. since other exhaustion perks would do the same, just better. Nothing braindead about it you fuck.😙
---
New Dwight ability: Yeet the Meg on hook.
---
Wow that’s the most upvoted post I’ve seen on this sub ever! And it deserves! Great art! Love it👍🏻
---
I really think it's a bad excuse though. You can just run to the middle of the map and that's it. It can actually hurt the team to just do "your" gen right away.
---
Does that provide a tactical advantage?
---
Ugh, as a survivor I hate THESE "mates" as well, especially since they also report on you for not instantly helping them.
---
Iron Will: I gOt YoU fAm
---
What do those two things have to do with each other at all
---
Some people aren't confident at running the killer, going anywhere that isn't where you spawn is highly likely to get the killer on you so its way better to just do your spawned gen then triage from there.
---
Holy fuck are you literally 12?

It says you have to do them completely, but you don’t actually have to do it completely. Your welcome ;)
---
See? This is what you get. 2 nice examples.
---
Omg I get your name now
---
Maybe cause the Hag has Hex: Third Seal?
---
What's your psn?
---
it is, which means you are healing at 92% of normal healing speed
---
well looks like i found it with my small game and broke it. i can see it now
---
send me a screenshot and I'll see what I can do
---
I don't see why items can't be transferred between survs since playing survivors is just a skin as no gameplay changes with survivors
---
H) lag spike for each shock blast
---
No. Only basic attacks
---
That's such a small thing to be upset over
---
I’m pro DC penalty trash posts about how good not dc penalty really isn’t bad
---
Love legion but hate legion
---
Hrm
---
Should've made it before the legion changes. It used to work before
---
Sure I’d love if you did. Thanks for the feedback it’s much appreciated.
---
You just need to be on it when it pops. Just keep going you’ll get it eventually. I used spine chill urban evasion and calm spirit. Don’t go for saves and don’t play risky. If you get a smaller map chances are you won’t get it. Wait for a map like Ormond or farm
---
Swf
---
3 gens for me was a pain, I won't even bother with 4..
---
I mean u dont need 0 to 100% it
---
Takes a while for new players to realise that the edges of the map are literally the most unsafe areas in the game for survivor.
---
Yea but oh well
---
What if someone dc’ed becouse of game breaking , are allowed to rejoin the match at cost of not earning blood points for the ingame activities that had been done . Might give chance to rejoin the match and get things better than completely out a player . And btw I love the game.
---
&gt;The fact that you did this in Tier 1 shows how stupid the survivors you faced are.
---
Tier 1 prevents Borrowed Time from triggering and he kept hugging the basement. How exactly are the survivors stupid? 
---
The one time a Claudette tried to lead him away from it, he dropped chase and came back to hit someone trying to escape the basement.
---
The killer leaving because everyone has toolboxes or flashlights equipped annoys the shit out of me too.
---
Don't be such a pussy and just run Franklin's in your build!
---
I'm doing this right now. My plan is to use bond and a good tool box. I'm gonna keep a low profile and walk around the map in a circle, everytime I see a team mate on a gen and it sounds like it's nearly done I will chip in and finish it. Of course you ideally want a potato killer
---
I believe first offense 30 min . Reset per day . 
---
If someone done it more than once it’s add up the time up to a week or a month
---
Yeah , good luck with that.
---
I expect a lot of dc's so I won't even try this one.
---
Hag with Monitor and abuse is like tier 2 myers
---
Except that most times you won't end up on the other side.
---
&gt; Survivors within the Terror Radius of the Husk will not hear the phasing sound. Survivors outside of that range will hear the sound, but will be unable to determine its direction.
---
Wiki doesn't say how far it goes unfortunately, but I'd guess 16-24m out from the edge of the terror radius.
---
Did you not see the dumbass plays they did?
---
The bill came back AFTER the guy in the basement died.
---
When the claud was saved, the nea ran up to take the hit but where was claudette? in the fucking corner waiting and instead of running up after michael ran pass her she went to the OTHER fucking corner of the basement.
---
They died because they were playing like idiots
---
At the end idk why the hell the nea decided to try and save since 
---
1 she was injured
---
2 micharl has literally nowhere else to go since she's the last one alive and 
---
3 if she had saved claud she would just get downed instantly since she dumb AF hurting her altruism
---
The moment 1 guy died in the basement it was pretty obvious to stay away from the boat but the bill just fucked them all over
---
and challenges like these are why people die on first hook and purposely de-pip so they can play against shitty killers which ruins games for everyone that gets into a game with said person.
---
Most games are able to do both of these things. For some reason this community’s expectations are extremely low.
---
^ what this person said. I let people stay on the ground/hook to stick to the gens. Those people were rescued and I did my gens. I was using Spine Chill, Dark Sense, Fixated, and Sprint Burst.
---
oh wait i just did it
---
&gt; The build isn’t particularly good as much as it is gimmicky. 
---
I agree, but when I play it I don't want to get 4K or be that sweaty, I just want scare jump people and land some sneaky hits.
---
Also I find funny when people blow up a gen when they see me enter the room. xD
---
they can escape via the hatch. just can't open the gates
---
Yep. Thanks
---
I am going yo play survivor 20 minutes in the lobby.. okay I am going to play killer two seconds and I have a lobby but the gens are done in two minutes.. Return to lobby simulator and dont play killer for a week
---
The Lvl. 4 Killer Quests where a breeze, did all of 'em in less then 2h. playtime. The ones in the middle I still need to do but as far as the pink rewards thingy goes I already got that. So effectively I don't need to do anything anymore unless I really want to.
---
That Billy deserved what he got, teabags and all.
---
Isn't the song we took each others hands? If so amazing taste.
---
You just need to play a game where the gates don't get opened. Any game will do! Just don't let 'em open the game use pink mori's camp and/or give the last guy the hatch, just keep them gates closed!
---
Trust me most people just want to get into the next game instead of spending as much time as possible on the floor. We don't need to assume a malicious intent.
---
The reason they crawl around is usually to hope to find the hatch.
---
It is cool that you learned very fast what you were doing wrong as trapper bc, unlike other killers he requires a different strat then just find chase hook next.
---
Usually, with Trapper, you have to give up one gen to set up enough traps to try and win in mid-game or end game. He is a bit of luck killer tbh there could be the chance a survivor misses your trap unintentionally or sometimes survivors are just on you 24/7 giving you no time to set up traps those games are hard to win.
---
As for perks, I don't know how I feel about Infections Fright on trapper but hey if it works it works personally I usually run Agitation bc often a survivor or two wants to bait me to try and hit them which agitation lets me do and get to a hook in time, Hex Ruin but I don't run it with the intent to slow down gens I run it with the idea of it getting broken hopefully kinda early to serve as a distraction while I am setting up more traps, Save The Best For Last honest it has won me games bc it just makes ur M1s that much better letting u get right back into chases, as for the 4th last one I have tried Play With Your Food which I thought if I am already using STBFL then I want to ignore my obsession I didn't rly like it mainly bc I completely forgot to get stacks when I had time but it is probably a good perk to just help that little bit, I also tried Nurses and M&amp;A which I felt was good but I personally like MYC the most since I don't want to camp MYC helps me in 2 ways 1. I can end a chase fast if I find the unhooker or 2. I can tunnel and have a passive timer for DS *yes it is a dick move but let's be honest sometimes it is better to tunnel then to walk aimlessly around the map finding nothing.*
---
I do agree Trapper is weak but very fun and feels very rewarding to win as I personally think though bc he is weak many players are discouraged from playing him which makes his traps that more effective fewer trappers means survivors learn less about spots ofc in higher ranks I have noticed ppl know even the most unpredictable spots but that is to be expected.
---
I am glad you had fun though
---
 Just keep playing , you will eventually get it . I thought that i was never gonna be able to complete this challenge but  i miraculously managed to pull it of first try (got extremly lucky) .
---
You should not be so dependent on a perk, especially like spine chill. Overall is somewhat good tho, it shines for the vault speed boost
---
this is amazing
---
I agree. This is terrible for the game. It's bad enough having people DC every other game, we dont need 30 minute games of farming. I would honestly never play this game again if it weren't for my wife's terrible addiction.
---
Everything about this game is ass-backwards. Look at Apex (or every single game that uses battle passes other than DBD). You can accomplish any of the weekly challenges at any time. You can technically do more than 1 simultaneously (i.e., Pathfinder kills, AR damage, zip lining, etc. Rather than choosing a single rift challenge. Forgot to select a challenge? FUCK YOU, your gen grab doesn't count!) You also get 3 daily challenges every day. We get 1 daily that is focused on 1 of like 35 characters and the BP value is negligent against the 1 trillion points you need to max out your characters.  Seriously, how is it that Bhvr ripped off the whole battle pass concept and failed to implement it even remotely close to every other game that has done battle pass? 
---
Ok, I'm off my soap box. Incoming down votes from the people that have 8 hours to play dbd everyday so they dont mind farming games.
---
It used to be meta for survivors I don't know what happened but people just slowly stopped using it like it is a great information perk
---
Knew you could do it OP!
---
You should try to learn how to play without it, but you shouldn't feel bad for using it.
---
Stealth killers are often played lately and it also helps you against most non-stealth killers as well. It's a good information perk
---
I lost the game
---
tbh I laugh at the steam comments I get I have around 140 that has accumulated and it always makes me laugh
---
It’s a top tier perk. Especially with the rise of stealth killers. Knowing when their coming towards you before they even know your there is so powerful. Giving you ample time to get to a pallet or a strong loop. Also works if your trying to pick up a slug while in a chase that speed bonus isn’t much but every little bit helps. And if your trying to pop the last gen while the killer is coming but it’s sooo close and at 99 when he gets you. Having spine chill would have made that gen pop giving you that sweet sweet adrenaline right in his face.
---
Bro, you don't get it. I know you see me going for the unhook but you should really be worrying about the people that you DON'T see that are SOMEWHERE on this map, bro, cmon, bro, don't something something TUNNEL CAMP.
---
So, the whole comic is about nea being toxic, you think that the hook tech is toxic?
---
You could look at the stats for all ranks too. They are in line with red ranks. But they're not going to balance a game around their "grandmaster" ranks. Especially since matchmaking pairs you up with people below you anyway
---
Ah yeah, you’re right. I kind of overlooked that. But yeah, I’ll always camp hook until struggle phase.
---
There are addons to reduce his terror radius in tier 2, but it becomes bigger in tier 3.
---
I think it is important we learn to laugh at stuff like this. it is like whenever I see killers complain over someone clicking a flashlight at them like I can get it sends a toxic message but nowadays whenever people click flashlights at me I completely ignore it bc usually it is to grab my attention
---
I got basement camped and tunneled because someone ELSE brought in a key..
---
Idk why people are hating on this lol. Pretty clutch flashlight save through the corn
---
That's...not really how this meme works.
---
The correct use would be Kate saying "I'll urban evade around the map", David saying "I'll farm my teammates" and Meg saying "I'll do generators".
---
I completely disagree on this one. The Trapper relies a lot on his traps way more then Ghostface does on his ability. It depends on the Playstyle but when I play Ghostface I usually only use his ability when I get the Expose a 100% otherwise I just use the stealth mechanic to injure all the survivors and then surprise them afterwards to get the down. It works out very well for me and it feels way stronger than playing trapper
---
You seem to miss the point of the comic. Read some of the other comments on this post. The comic is about getting called a tunneler just for punishing a survivor that is always runs up to your face.
---
That is exactly why I use dead hard.
---
However, they do not stack. The 100 percent bonus of We ll make it cannot be raised higher. Besides that I totally feel ya.
---
Fr. Thankfully it’s just a test
---
This is a beautiful death.
---
Well, indeed I got this idea, actually I saw other comments from yourself and made this conclusion based on what I saw
---
Do you have to actually be there to finish the gen or do you just have to do a small amount of each gen?
---
You had me at 6 generators.
---
When I started playing and saw leatherface on the killer list
---
I ALWAYS THOUGHT RANDOM DOWNPOURS DOWNVOTES WERE JUST PART OF THE REDDIT EXPERIENCE.
---
KINDA LIKE RANDOM BULLSHIT GETTING YOU KILLED/SAVING THAT TBAGGING SURVIVOR IS PART OF THE DBD EXPERIENCE.
---
My issue with that is using an M1 depletes your power so you get punished for it but it's his only way to actually down people.  Like I'm not delusional and think he should be OP again I just think most of his kit conflicts with itself making him in a weird place between viable and down right stupid
---
Can you explain why you suck if you killl a guy trying to get your attention that gets within range of your attacks? I know a bit about how dbd works I just don’t understand this development
---
Well you might have got the wrong conclusion. I’m not saying nea is toxic, I’m only using her because she is the meme of the community for being the more obnoxious one :3
---
Errrrgh another dark sense challenge great.....but to answer your question yeah you just need to be in the gen when it’s finished.
---
Yes finally a challenge that’s doable
---
That’s really brain expanding, won’t lie. Killers are so funny sometimes. I got face camped once because they didn’t like my username. It wasn’t even bad, just a reference to a video game.
---
&gt; I've been blocked in while carrying a survivor while survivors teabag and flashlight click
---
So just hit them? At the end of the day survivors can't really ruin a game the way a killer can if he face camps. I don't see how you think getting 60 seconds of gameplay out of a game because the killer decided to face camp on first hook is a slight inconvenience.
---
I’m not reading that. But take it easy man, hopefully you have fun playing something new
---
u just need to be there when it is about to get done u dont need to do 100% of the work
---
Because last time I am confident you had to complete the gen from 0, or 3 gens worth of repair, so this should be easier?
---
Just add a "give up" button that the team can vote, if everyone vote yes, the entity kill all (like end game collapse) and the killer get late game + sacrifice points, that way teams are not forced to play against killers that refuse to hook and let all 4 bleed out, or when killers block you and go afk. Also add this to killer side so they can get away from uraniun toxic squads.
---
\-waste all your good stuff before you prestige so you don't lose it
---
\- be prepared to not be able to play that killer again until you have your perks back( so have some bps saved up if you want to keep playing them with perks)
---
\- I would personally only prestige once you've unlocked most of the teachables, and want to show off on your favorite killer
---
No, they won’t grant rift fragments anymore. That’s stated in the message about L IV being unlocked.
---
Nice to hear, but maybe harder than the previous version of the challenge?
---
The previous challenge where you needed to complete 3, you could complete a gen from 95% to 100% and it still counted.
---
Oh, I see, sorry. I'm not atacking you or anything, I loved the commic (first pannel in special). I just wanna hear people opinion on this tech, I done it twice and I kinda don't wanna be the "toxic ace piece of shit"
---
idk I haven't done any Tome 4 yet
---
Who knows
---
I think because i uploaded 5 or so clips at once, apparently its "flooding" and we are going to run out of room on the subreddit or something, i just share because its fun and if people like it great, if they dont oh well, i get nothing out of it personally except a bit of conversation on a game i like.
---
Your obsession you say? Well that in of itself fits in the lore of him anyways! 
---
also I was thinking of a teleport mechanic but I don't know howd they implement it and how jarring it would be for just a random telpeport. But its a good addition
---
Doesn't seem like much of a nerf to me
---
I think everyone joins basically at the same time anyway, so you can't do that anymore.
---
I can’t take it anymore! I just wanna die already!!!!!
---
if I see no scratch marks I look for blood bc they might have jumped in a locker
---
It's almost like being good at Fortnite doesn't make you automatically good at all other games.
---
Unless you are Admiral Bahroo. Honestly, he deserves ninjas status more than ninja, but this is life.
---
Also the killer: Only chase they will do is right around the hook.
---
I just wonder what they look like

Every time as killer
---
Yeah but Nurse just has a kit that can literally ignore everything. Nurse is still top tier and you could probably run Infectious, Nurses, Monitor, and some random 4th perk, slug and its a guarenteed win.
---
It's a slight inconvenience because survivors can at least LEAVE pretty easily.
---
Just heal them 4head
---
Spirit’s katana actually used to shatter if she hit a wall while carrying a survivor. Too bad they removed the animation
---
Honestly at this point BHVR should just show a label:
---
*SWF: № of platers together*
---
And incentivize playing against SWF with bonus points.
---
People who dodge SWF will do it regardless, but at least they won't dodge those who just connected at the same time.
---
actually freddy with dream pallets use brutal strength, so it doesnt help you at all
---
Time will tell but losing his ability to hinder survivors from interacting with pallets/windows will do a lot.
---
I made it abundantly clear....
---
Are you actually going to tell me or are you going to keep avoiding the subject?
---
The tier 4 challenges look easy except for the sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement and do 4 gens with dark sense
---
You like to feel pain worst adept in the game
---
You can, only perks count.
---
Ah yes because survivors are always the ones who are toxic and killers are innocent victims themselves.
---
What map is that again? I only know maps by oh this will be an interesting match to, oh fuck why the swamp
---
My honest answer is i can not blame people dcing from a match they were bound to lose, but yes, they deserve a penalty no matter what.
---
&gt;so I dislike how you are being mad at only one side.
---
But you're doing the same thing.
---
It’s the one that has a variant with the animatronic/possessed horse.
---
Well that would go without saying, it's part of the quest...
---
They stack. We’ll Make It by itself cannot go above 100% but it can be combined with Botany.
---
The devs in the q&amp;a: look more cosmetics
---
How am I doing the same thing? 
---
In case you didn’t know , JK stands for “Just Kidding”
---
But your playing as bill
---
You say that yet when I played with my friend yesterday he was ranting how the challenge was broken
---
If your game crashes or internet dies you get the same penalty, that is what most don't like.
---
The only good apprentice he had was Dr Gordon
---
Good work contributing to the problem. Bravo...
---
Its this subreddit summed up, but if you make a post or joke about killers being toxic expect a shit ton of downvotes.
---
It starts on January 2nd
---
SF+Enduring if you Want to get your chases carried by perks.
---
He still has his shock though. Only difference is now he won’t have to switch modes and has an on command static field rather than a luck based one.

Maybe you need to distance yourself for idiots like that, it might eventually rub off :-)

does it seriously want me to be the one completing 4 of the 5 generators in one game? cause that requires either me sabotaging for teammates or having a team that wont do the objective..
---
Good, about time you saw what I said and realized how fucking wrong and contradicting of your own statement you are.
---
it's fun when you have a sense of sadism towards these "people" who should be in therapy instead of DBD and a sense self-awareness to not be like them. If you dont have those you'd probably burn out pretty fast I imagine.
---
Why is it that killers are only toxic if a survivor is? The hillybilly was probably cunt without the survivors.
---
I Don't think so
---
[Here.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/113941/live-q-a-recap-december-18th-2019#latest) It's a link to the Q&amp;A the devs did recently. The doc changes are near the bottom.
---
Thing is tho, because the queues are so long, I can’t move up. And when I did, rank reset hit me back down
---
Hey that is money well spent. I have just recently picked the shape up because I really wanted Play with your Food. Tombstone Myers is a blast. I know it’s almost certainly not optimal but I also love the mirror add on wheee you can’t leave Evil Within 1. Myers addons imo are the gold standard of what addons should be. Totally changes his play style.
---
So just loop the map and find survivors working on gens and see if its close to done

Still won't stop ppl from DCing

Ahh the basic bitch build

I understand that this is lore and canon.   
---
I hope you, then, understand that I am choosing to ignore this part of canon for my idea of the killers living together like in Friends.
---
Nah, 10k take it or leave it. Challenge is too easy.
---
Thanks and yeah those changes seem pretty good
---
Going out of your way to get the killer's attention is not toxic, what's toxic is when you then pretend like the killer shouldn't focus you afterwards.
---
Oh yeah let me just hate on one side and then say JK but call someone else out for it.
---
When I have dailies or challenges I let them happen organically.  You don’t always get what you want at that moment.
---
You can visit the /r/LeaksByDaylight subreddit if you like. They have a lot of the info you'll need on this.
---
I agree, you should totally get a BP multiplier based on how many survivors are pre-made or sumn like that!
---
Just had a survivor get stuck in the ground after being dropped by killer, they couldn't move, be hit, or be healed.
---
Dead by Daylight
---
^(Due to these ridiculous queue times)
---
24 same as hags
---
Yes they did. They also did a Q&amp;A stream yesterday where they talked about it as well.
---
thx
---
I was only on 2 gens when they finished, but maybe it was a bug and I was just lucky, but I think more they changed it
---
I had someone berate me for not letting them the door once. Except I also had the daily.
---
It is what it is, if the killer sees me running back to the hook to save someone and I get killed for it, thats not camping its my fault for not being discreet and saving correctly
---
And in this situation its one in the same, if i chase someone the whole game and they get away while their team pops 5 gens, the hats off to them thats really difficult, and I could changed strategy and should have
---
Both sides have their share of difficulties and a good killer or survivor is just good they deserve the praise for their efforts, not salt
---
I would love silent chainsaw hillbilly, or some addon that lets you set fake traps to mindgame loops with the trapper.
---
It’s not like their 3 lasts forever, fan out and swarm lmaoo
---
Both
---
It's an unpopular opinion and a sad one, but if your internet is that spotty you should not be playing a game like this. Its a shame because everyone should be able to play whatever game they want, but If you are prone to this issue you are chancing that you will ruin the game for the other players in your match.
---
How long does it take one to wait for a match
---
Pretty bad tact, but usually it is because they are bad and panicking rather than anything malicious.
---
Killer main here, and I can barely see the blood on most maps. It’s so dark and blends with the dirt/grass. I am not colorblind but the game makes me feel like I am.
---
I literally gave u a answer
---
Nothing wrong with that. Shame on you.
---
No.
---
My name is Evan MacMillan, I'm 33 years old. My shack is in the northeast section of my estate, where all the hooks are, and I am not married. I work for the Entity as a killer, and I return to my shack every day 8 PM at the latest. I dont smoke but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11PM and I make sure to get 8 hours of sleep every night, no matter what. After having a glass of blood points and doing about 20 minutes worth of chases before going to bed. I usually have problems sleeping till morning. Just like a killer main, I wake up in the morning feeling stressed and fatigued. I was told there were no issues since my last match. I'm trying to explain that I am a killer who wishes for a quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with piping or de-piping. That would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with survivors, and I know that it brings me happiness. Although if I were to fight I would lose atleast one pip
---
Oh man, a Fly chapter is a really unique idea, I'm down for it.
---
**However,** 2 of these perks already exist. Feeding time is a _much_ worse Stridor and Fly on the Wall is a worse Surveillance. Inhuman Instincts is _almost_ a worse Discordance, but it still has advantages that perk doesn't give.
---
I'm down for this chapter, getting rep for an all-time classic. I'd suggest reworking the perks though. Good writeup! &lt;3
---
I would give an award, but i'm poor so this will suffice. 🏅
---
Killer entitlement in this thread is unreal
---
Behavior isn't like three dudes in a room with a Dell laptop, they're a game company, and not a small one either. There's no reason they can't do both unless they're staggeringly incompetent.
---
Aw yeah I got a reward. Thanks pally
---
It sucks when you need something and someone else takes it. I ran inner strength and had randoms cleanse a dull in front of me when I was trying to gesture I *really* needed the totem, not just for points
---
Yah that was the main focus point and the Dr. 
---
Not_queen was pretty much Scrooge with the whole “NO WINTER EVENT”

---

---
Servers are still trash and the "fixes" are mostly the bugs they caused in the DLC update.
---
ex fucking scuse me WHERE IS THE COMPLIMENT ON SUSIES NEW SHIRT
---
im a big fan of this perk, but i somethimes feel like replacing it for something more strong, i feel that the really good players can play fine without it
---
I like her purple hoodie more.
---
REEEEEEE
---
I thought it meant SquidWard Flashlight, the ultra rare flashlight that is super unbalanced because it inks the killer's view for a longer time than a normal flashlight, as well as darkening their view for a while afterwards.
---
All very good points man!
---
I think because you play both killer and survivor, you get a good understanding of the balancing issues.
---
It's killer mains who get too entitled that bug me.
---
As a fairly high ranked survivor, I expect to escape on maybe 1 in every 4 games. But Killers seem to feel like they have a god given right to kill everyone in every match and if something like 4 toolboxes potentially hinders that they quit before trying. Plus the killer's usually always outscore survivors so I don't know why they care so much!
---
4. 25 hits took 2, 4 breaks took 1, 2 grabs took 1. The 4 breaks was like 5m because I purposefully didn't apply pressure to other gens.
---
honestly, I only prestige survivors/killers if I want their bloody cosmetics or if by the time I reach level 50 on them I don’t have the right perks I want to run on them. if you were to prestige though, I would save up 1 mil bloodpoints and then prestige them. that way you can just give them a good 30-40 levels straight of the bat (depending on what you buy).
---
Bruh I tried to do the self care challenge 3 times without selecting it  was mad
---
You might like Wraith. Tru3 finally picked up the strategy I've been consistently successful with after seeing his original Ghostface build.
---
Ruin/Sloppy/Nurses with the 4th slot being flexible for Pop/Thanatophobia/BBQ/Franklin's (I've been more successful with Pop lately)
---
For add-ons you want at least 1 of the Windstorms (cloaked movement speed) and for your other add-on you can either do the silent bell, global bell, or an additional Windstorm.
---
You then go through a pressure-&gt;nurses/injured phase. People are constantly injured vs a stealth killer, never really know where you are, and you have high movement speed.
---
Oh yeah, it's tough. These challenges change it up haha. I need to learn to blind evidently.
---
Love that perk it’s really good against Myers,ghostface,wraith and the pig
---
I think it gives a better fov. It also shrinks character model sizes as a survivor. Especially for bigger models like Jake, bill, and Jeff.
---
Myers? Broken?
---
What are you smoking because I want some.
---
Fun yes, broken no.
---
Neat
---
Someone actually lost the game for his team the other day because I hit him with BT and he was just crouching in a corner for some reason as I hit the last survivor. I have no damn clue how.
---
Interesting interpretation of what we mean by tunneler
---
Fine.   Reduce the number of pallets based on the swf number then.
---
Lightweight won't help much, it makes your scratchmarks that normally last 10 seconds, last 7 seconds. So it makes then despawn faster but it also tells the killer where fresher scratchmarks are.
---
Guess you didn’t get the joke?
---
With my 216 hour playtime I can't recall 1 toxic killer yet I can recall countless toxic survivors, and I mostly play survivor.
---
The joke is very evident, just poorly executed in my opinion

Mori add-ons and Infinite T3 sure not easy to use but not balanced
---
Yes, they stack. The 100% refers to the max bonus WMI itself can give so you can’t unhook three survivors and get a 300% bonus. 
---
The bonus from medkits and spine chill stack with WMI so your basic healing speed can easily go above 100%. 
---

---
Also anyone with monitor and abuse, dark devotion etc... I just seem too reliant on it lol
---
The problem with that is that if your team mates aren't potatos ( which at rank 3 they mostly aren't) then whilst you are doing gens at least one of them will be too. If they do more than 1 gen without you then you have failed the challenge, so the best way to do it is to run around and make sure you don't miss any gens being completed. 
---
Also you are less likely to bump into the killer if you move around the edges of the map going from gen to gen than if you stay at a gen for a long period of time.
---
Clearly entitled
---
Yeah but killers get way more tilted that survivors
---
It's a challenge man just gotta keep at it
---
I’ll try to do better next time. (And I still think you don’t get it. The comic is trying to say people who call that tunneling are ridiculous.)
---
Don’t if that’s the case killers are too reliant on Ruin and bbq
---
Yea it's annoying I don't like farming killers either I just wanna play a normal game of dbd and I can't even DC bc the penalty system on PC so I'm stuck there
---
Run padded jaws as trapper.
---
Its not a crutch - but it is one of the best perks on the game when used right. 
---
Because it is literally useful at all times. Whether you are working on a gen, cleansing totems, wandering the map, being chased, opening an exit gate, unhooking somebody, healing somebody.
---
This is why it can feel empty when you are used to using it - because it provides so much information that benefits your game overall. Obviously if you are a SWF 4 player team of flash-lighters and running builds it won't be as necessary, but for a solo survivor I think it is the best perk in the game.
---
And don't even start saying DS is the best because a good survivor won't even find the need to use it.
---
Get over it. Delete this post. Forget about it
---
Get over it. Delete this comment. Forget about it.
---
This is solid advice, much appreciated.
---
Due to the archives I've gotten decent looks for most of the killers and it's the survivors that are lacking. A few of them could do with more camouflage, so I'll think about which ones need could be improved once I have a fat wad of BP in bank.
---
Lol yes, ruin is my spine chill
---
I'm just saying if someone is just running around the map their gonna get chased
---
I mean. BHVR put themselves into this position
---
It's so much fun especially when they out right dodge the killer like this wasn't meant to be a sacrifice
---
Wait, sorry new player, does queue time get longer as you rank up? Coz mine's almost instant for survivor
---
Waaaahhhh
---
Yeah, I just enjoy a regular game of dbd. Farming isn't even smart to do for points, by the time you do 1 prolonged farming game you could've done 2 regular games and got more points with the possibility of not getting a double tick.
---
If he had Fragrant Tuft I can definitely see why they escaped, but if not they could’ve hid around you until his Tier 3 ran out then all came for you.
---
"Servers still sucks ass"
---
"There are still alot of bugs"
---
I wanted to play killer, for I could get better, but it was soooooo fucking long. I played one match as killer and i had two people DC and I wanted death
---
Cool I hope ur right
---
Just a little heads up, spirits Japanese is “スピリット” not “精神”, google translate is not very accurate because words can have multiple meanings
---
Hell yeah cant wait for clowns doot doot doodloo
---
I dare u to say that on any dbd post
---
I'm not your buddy, pal!
---
I found this out pretty quick, but another thing it took me awhile to find out when I first started was that NOED and No One Escapes Death were the same thing. “I think the killer has NOED, wonder if he has No One Escapes Death too.” I’m pretty sure I thought NOES was Nurse’s Calling lmao
---
It also drives me away from the game when other people dc.
---
Those who are willing to ruin the experience of everyone else in that match shouldn't be allowed to queue.
---
As a blendette main, your the one thing I’m scared of
---
Like I'm a bad survivor cause I get anxious playing survivor but I know not to do that
---
Can you see clearly now, is the rain gone?
---
OP thought they could post two pictures of Meg and we wouldn’t notice smh my head
---
I did not
---
"You ruined my mood" is something literally only people you care about can say and even then its a dickish thing for them to say in most situations. Some random saying it is just "lol okay"
---
Same bro i just fucking noticed it
---
Why do people put up with this. It's not a good way of spending your time. Your in a lobby longer than a game and even than you can't predict what will happen in that game to justify the wait time. 
---
I give the lobby five minutes, if I'm still waiting I turn it off. 
---
Value your time more guys because it isn't free and it will run out.
---
Lets put the double blood point event when everyone goes back to work, We smart
---
Get the jersey and you’re done!!
---
I kind of wish that they had the presents in the bloodweb at least. Not going to lie, those were pretty cool.

What happens to the Tome after the rift closes? Does it become unavailable?
---
All of these were sent right after each other he was furious
---
Trapper heavily relies on perks that slow the game down as his early game takes pretty long. Wraith heavily relies on good addons to be viable in higher ranks. Trapper has slightly better teachables compared to Wraith, but overall I’d say Wraith is the better killer. Of course this is my opinion, I’d love to hear what some of you guys think
---
Yeah it is a solid perk and I am a solo survivor so have this and bond. I agree that DS isn't the best perk in the game but it is one of the most impactful. Most of the time you don't need it though.
---
I think you look as Meg as you can without actually being Meg lol. Good job!
---
Should farm with them make it worth while bc that specific challenge isn’t fun for anyone
---
Bruh I had a Blendette message me calling me a scumbag and a hacker cause they thought I had infinite feral frenzy but it's cause they hid and mended then I ran back and hit them again.  I spent 80% of the game in feral frenzy
---
oh i will im already working on it :3
---
thanks :o
---
But it’s not a challenge when it’s mostly out of your control. It’s not in my power to make people dc or not, nor is it in my power that my team isn’t doing gens (I’m referring to the 4-gens-dark-sense challenge)
---
That’s what makes the difference between a challenge and a grind.
---
HUNTRESS SHOULD BE DISABLED UNTIL BEHAVIOUR CAN BE FUCKING BOTHERED TO FIX HITBOXES, I'M FUCKING TIRED OF IRIDESCENT HEADS PASSING 4 FEET TO THE LEFT AND DOWNING ME
---
For me, golden standard add-ons are Hag add-ons. One that makes her traps silent and without a clone, and one that makes her clones bodyblock. Now that's different flavors of the Hag.
---
Also I love scratched mirror Myers, but Mori Myers isn't that fun for me.
---
Only tracer add-on makes Nurse different. "Insidious" add-on isn't really... good on normal nurse since she's &lt;100% killer, without LOADS of detection perks doesn't work well. Walking add-ons... just make her walk.
---
I look at the outfits as a Ying and Yang sorta thing. Both hairstyles have opposite colors and directions.
---
It does not say that! That's 100% old tier 4. It only says to finish repairing 4 generators with Dark Sense.
---
And tier 4 required 0 cooperation on my part and I finished the whole tier. 2 hours on Killer and 4 on Survivor (dummy long wait times). Longest challenge for me was the Dark Sense challenge as you have to jump on gens with others then run and see what other gens are almost done all while avoiding the killer.
---
3k NOED during end game collapse build. Run Hillbilly with NOED, Deerstalker, Blood Warden, and Ruin. Use Carb Tuning guide and the green addon that reduces cooldown and slight charge speed. 2 hook everyone (shouldn't be hard) then apply a ton of pressure by making sure everyone is injured for easy tracking. Down someone with chainsaw after they finish the gens, keep an eye on with deerstalker, and try to down a second person nearby. When you down the second person, open a gate and pick up the first downed survivor. Then hook the second guy. You now have one minute to find someone (shouldn't be too difficult). That's how I did it and it only took me 2 games to do.
---
Tier 3 was long grindy bullshit.
---
The Claudette story is so awful.
---
The story doesn't even seem to know what it wants to say about Claudette. Apparently her parents are worried about her grades, but then her mum cries when she asks for a microscope or whatever. You would think her parents would want to encourage scholarly interest? People think she's weird because she's too smart, but also apparently she's too dumb and is failing school. Her mum cries a lot about a lot of things but can't seem to decide what she's crying about.
---
The resemblance is uncanny
---
Brilliant response
---
it’s not even a grind lol. when you grind, you usually have a set outcome that’s foreseeable. like, getting 10 gens done. this is just luck.
---
The trapper one is so much better with a way better cutscene at the end lol
---
Billy, Bubba, Leatherface, Cannibal - as far as I know, there are at least four chainsaw killers.
---
I did it without sfw. On 2 tries.
---
I had bond, the perk where aurareading is enhanced, kindred, and darksenses.
---
A rainbow map to find the gens quickly.
---
Everytime. I saw a teammate working on a Gen I worked with them.
---
Even if it was just to finish it up.
---
Of course it's no guarantee to get it done quickly.
---
But it worked for me.
---
I was at rank 4 btw.
---
I also did the noed challenge and I am trying for the 4 hooks in the basement.
---
It's hard.
---
But doable.
---
I'm not even a good killer or survivor.
---
Streamers builds do not = good make you better  use the build that works for you
---
The Hag May be a swamp witch, but that doesn’t bean she *has* to hex survivors with hex perks. She can still get the point across that she’s a witch by the fact that she uses black magic to kill survivors. Jason, on the other hand, would have to use that perk to actually be like himself from the movies instead of being an M1 killer whose entire power revolves around being patient and chasing survivors. Movie Jason kills with the first strike, not after chasing his victim for a minute and a half.
---
Pretty spot on, nicely done lass
---
Ace in the hole
---
Looks like they modeled her after you. Nice job.
---
So it is written
---
i dont see a problem here
---
Try using Trapper with Iron Grasp and Agitation. I got it luckily first try due to RNG, but it shouldn't be too difficult with proper set up.
---
Nah they just played normally so it was probably for a meme
---
&gt; I agree that DS isn't the best perk in the game but it is one of the most impactful. Most of the time you don't need it though.
---
Great way of putting it.
---
Perhaps what I said was a little vague:
---
So game starts and you start near a gen. Killer will usually head to the gens straight away unless it's trapper etc.. So move away from the gen and using bond figure out where your team mates are. The killer will most likely be moving through the center to give them the best chance of finding survivors and getting to gens faster, so if you move around the edge of the map in a circle then you are less likely to be found. Of course it helps to have a perk like spine chill or to move around past loops which provide cover and an escape route. As you circle the map you will find team mates on gens and if they are like 90% done then join in.
---
It's one of the only ways I think this can be done as a solo survivor because I tried just working on gens normally with a good toolbox but every game my team mates did more than 1 gen between them whilst I was doing gens.
---
That’s a bad idea, remember how everyone used to DC as soon as they saw they were up against legion? Now imagine that again, going in as killer but the match ending and you missing out on points/dailies/achievements/challenges/fun because the survivors don’t like the killer you’re playing.
---
Yes, yes it does.

Current "top tier nurse" is just as much top tier as, let's say, the Pig. A pig main gets 4ks basically in 3/4 of games, but everybody else sucks ass at her. That's how top tier current nurse currently is. Some kind of stupid shit gate keeping: "They made Nurse harder so bad players can't play her!".
---
Do you think maybe I should drop SC and do Bond + Alert/Dark Sense instead of Kindred? The only downside is when I'm hooked the others won't get some good info.
---
*cries in legion*
---
I always wait at least 10 minutes for a math, then get a message saying “Unable to join host.” Then why the FUCK would you try and match me with them?
---
Honestly I’m not even sure how the system works anymore. Got a perfect 32k game using Freddy. Nobody escaped but they did finish all the gens. I guess that makes sense, but if you get a 4k AND have a perfect game, you should get a merciless

Well for trapper your map pressure is better as you can cut off certain loops. Ghostface usually needs to focus on one person  but as trapper you can corral multiple people into the paths of your traps. If it's a strong loop just stop and put a trap they literally cant do anything about it ghostface just isn't as good.
---
"BuT wE gAvE yOu CosMeTiCs!"
---
Do you think Urban Evasion might make a good alternative? Quick and Quite?
---
Basically what I have been doing lately. I'm not too psyched where the game is right now so taking a break. I have been on annual leave since last Friday and the amount of work around the house I have achieved is amazing. Plus I have been playing other games: Hunt, Dying Light, and Planet Coaster.
---
Changes need to be made before I come back. I'm sure others have their foot already out the door and are only waiting for another game to come out to play...
---
Not to mention if it's the teammates first hook and they are running Kindred it's actually the safest looping you can do since you have wallhacks.
---
With both of the Dark Sense bullshit challenges i messaged people in the lobby and luckily for me i got teammates who were willing to help me :) 
---
Best bet is: one good looper takes the attention of the killer and rest work on gens together.
---
Yeah I'm levelling my ghost face again to run this build.  I love the idea of the build!  I'm definetally gonna run it on him and wraith right now I'm playing a lot of oni and trying to figure out a build/playstyle for clown he seems weaker since I started playing him again I feel like they vault faster while intoxicated... I hope thats not the case cause I love clown and I know he isn't meta but I prefer fun killers over Meta
---
Which doesn’t matter because she has a 40 meter humming radius...
---
Trapper isn't low tier, 3 gen setups should always be in mind but it's a backup plan, corrupt and ruin shouldn't be ran together
---
Urban evasion seems like the better of the two, but if you have lithe and use that also then quick and quiet is better.
---
Nah..  if they wanted that, then they should have been there first.
---
So, do you blame people to not want to play against unfun killera or blame devs for making such a shit killer? Don't force people to play when they don't wanna. 
---
BuT hOw aBoUt mY fUn??!!!!
---
If you think that 1 person having fun and 4 not is fair, then you need some humanity in your heart.
---
It's called egocentrism - believing your own view but not being able to understand that there can be other views of the same issue.  I'd play with someone else who isn't just going to see things from their perspective.
---
Tbf tho all I was expecting was a lobby change and maybe the items. I felt like they way they went about stating there wasn't going to be anything came off as. "We have you all this stuff so be grateful!" I'm glad they are working on fixing the game but until I see alot of positive changes to the game I'm gonna have to agree with someone else who commented here. They are not a tiny team. They should be able to do more than they do.
---
THE BASEMENT IS THE DEVS WAY OF TELLING US THEY WANT US TO CAMP
---
How much does it bother you to be in injured state? 
---
You have IW, so it's not much of a problem, you will be healed eventually.
---
I'd swap SC for bond just for time savings alone.
---
Alert can be somewhat ok, but I'd say it's more useful when in chase and looping.
---
Don't really see the point in dark sense since it requires a gen pop.
---
Leather face for the best killer teachable in the game
---
LAST NIGHT I PLAYED FOR 2 HOURS AND THERE WERE NO WHINY GRIEFERS! THERE'S STILL HOPE!
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Only rank 3 enduring, right?
---
I got Oni and Plague recently and I think Plague is much more fun right now. She also has 2 great perks (Infectious and Corrupt) and one usable perk (Dark Devotion), while Oni only has like one niche perk (Nemesis for obsession builds). Before the nerf I would‘ve said Oni since he was definitely one of the best Killers in the game and very satisfying to play with the flick.
---
Haha, I love how much you can learn about the game from just reddit memes \^\^
---
Nah, use knock out, agitation, iron grasp and a perk of your choice, but probably ruin, slug and hope for the best.
---
Doing my chest challenge, I had more games where I escaped than didn't. Mainly due to the items I was looting.
---
Take the last game I played yesterday before bed, where I was doing the loot challenge. I looted an Emergency Medkit and then a Ranger Medkit that I gave to my team that helped the Nancy heal Meg and I up super fast after an unhook. Then I looted an Alex's Toolbox that I used to dismantle the Trapper traps around the killer shack and cow tree. This allowed me to loop him for the final 2 gens and had Meg not messed up again, our whole team would have gotten out.
---
Wish they had a system like this on pc
---
well then get wishful that the devs rework it idk
---
Dude relax. We all know what it’s like to go in games like that. But your suggestion is a bad one, your main reason for this is good but you have to remember that teams will use this for more reasons than the killer being a dick. Also if your game is really going that badly then DC, you’re not going to get punished massively for one DC. 
---
And in all fairness how often do you actually get games like that, in my experience it’s 1 in 100
---
Okay but does the pig go through walls and pallets? No didn’t think
---
So
---
It all depends on your play style because every killer u have to play differently
---
Will you post the finished cosplay please? ♥ looks good
---
well even tombstone piece sure it wastes a whole T3 that could have possible just ended the game that fast but ur just still just removing a survivor from the game. 
---
and IN MY experience just making that clear usually once survivors realize what addons I am using it is too late, broken maybe isnt the right word but not that great of balance
---
Sure buddy, you can negate it here but the moderators know that ;) dw about it
---
Bm stands for "bad manners", this is both toxic and Bm.
---
I only used pharmacy too
---
Makes sense it is his only good perk
---
I would recommend leatherface exclusively because of barbecue and chili, if the killer is more interesting to you than the perk I would recommend spirit.
---
yes ofc :) ill work as fast as possible on it :D
---
ofc I am not saying it has no counter play but that counter play is basically hoping every survivor knows what is happening and will do gens a SWF will have no problems probably even seasoned players but around mid tier rankings is where I think the addons is a bit OP not like old frank mixtape OP but old 0 TR freddy *tbh I dont remember if ppl considered 0 TR freddy OP but he did have wallhacks* idk tis just my opinion
---
I always feel bad when I get saved with borrowed time and I try and take the hit and the killer just dodges me and goes for the saver. I swear some killers just know. Though I have had a few games where I gamed the killer into thinking we had borrowed time when we didn't. Had a tunneling doctor last night and I get saved on the second hook and I run towards the doctor he assumed borrowed time and went for the saver. Long story short doctor kept after the saver and gave me enough time to heal and finish last gen (already like 95% done) and get door open for us both to escape.
---
What does the one on the art say then?
---
Anyways, I bought it :D gonna try it tomorrow and gonna let you know!
---
Yeah cuz they stopped updating the game 2 years ago. tf are you on about???
---
Killers and Survivors will frequently dodge any match that is up against any &gt; 2 ranks because "iT's So uNfAiR aGaInSt SuCh MaSsIvELy BrOkEn MaTcHmAkInG"

Why do people put up with this? It's not a good way to spend your time. You're in a lobby longer than a game and even then you can't predict what will happen in that game to justify the wait time. 
---
I give the lobby five minutes: if I'm still waiting I turn it off.
---
You can’t buy Leatherface with IS, plus I got BBQ from the shrine a while ago.
---
IKR, it's funny, right? How can a killer with power like this be as effective as a basic loopable killer, but also have a dramatically worse popularity?
---
I can’t stop laughing at how short Meg is in this picture
---
This is the way.
---
Probably bc once 2019 started they where most likely *"not stating a fact"* I would assume they where working on getting Dedicated Servers working along with the Map reworks and the nurse addon rework *"and I think freddy and legion rework but I wanna say those hit by the end of 2018 I honest to god dont remember"*
---
DC penalty for some reason
---
Nobody is saying it's bad. It's just someone outgaming you, it's fine. 
---
However if they loop you all game and then get hooked, you've outgamed them. 
---
I respect but don't really understand the mentality of killers who say 'if they loop me a lot, they get to live'. Surely they get to live if they escape? Does someone who is good at the game and clearly enjoys the competition really want a pity escape?
---
I remember getting camped and tunneled to death by a Freddy who got triggered at me clicking at a pallet :D
---
Little did they know i was just clicking at the pallet as a *"hey i know this is fake"* instead of clicking at them lol
---
That I did not know. Thanks! We'll make it has some misleading text.
---
The thing is a good pig will NEVER be as good as a good nurse so your whole point that they are equal is invalid
---
And have almost 0 counterplay *(if there was no pallet broken before, otherwise you'd see that there was one before)* unless you saw the killer put it up or you were in the area before :)
---
So much fun!
---
Honestly, I don’t even get mad at the survivors when they wanna showboat a little after they destroy me. I usually message them after the game something like “Damn dude ggs you guys destroyed me, nice playing.” Most of them actually apologize for being toxic after that lmao. I do the same when playing survivor, if the killer just straight up decimates us I message them something friendly. There’s no point in really getting mad unless it’s for a good reason, there’s always gonna be that one dick of a killer/survivor that blinds you and tbags or tunnels you ruthlessly then says some shit like “Ggs ez ur trash” but I mean those people exist in every game. Idk man being toxic just isn’t the way I like to play
---
Of course I know this killer, it’s me. Except I didn’t kill anyone and when I said I wanted to farm they ran away from me...
---
It is the law
---
Why would I want to waste my holidays sitting in a game that i cant play. Instead of wanting to play, to progress and level up your characters, why not progress your own character - you. I've been progressing my own character: work, gym, social life - I wont sit in lobbies while me as a character sits silent.  
---
Good work on the house
---
Try to use that logic in any pvp online game. When you realize **only** this community defends DC, maybe you'll realize that's stupid not punish someone who is so egoistic that would ruin everyone's game for it's ego
---
You're in luck bhvr isn't as rigid as other games that gives 30min queue ban for the first offense
---
almost amazing rly wanna learn how to do such clean 360s on pc
---
I personally like Wraith more than Ghostface because:
---
1. Bing Bong
---
2. Movement speed
---
I would say Ghostface is better though. For Oni, I have no help for you. I've tried a lot with Oni but he just feels extremely weak after they nerfed his turning.
---
For Clown, I recommend Ruin/Brutal/STBFL/Corrupt or Pop
---
Ruin is.. Ruin.. Brutal is to shred through the pallets that people will be dropping very quickly. STBFL is to help his speed. Pop helps with your lack of gen pressure. 
---
For add-ons I prefer Exhaustion + increased Duration. The one that adds the extra hindered penalty is also good, as well as the increased AoE add-on.
---
A lot of mistakes that I see Clowns make is that they chase survivors for WAY too long. Clown is the master of forcing down pallets and with Brutal, you're ripping through them. SWITCH TARGETS!! Your new target doesn't know what pallets you've run through. STBFL helps reduce the distance of their sprint burst, and the chance that they will make it to an un-dropped pallet. I can 4k pretty consistently with him at red ranks, but the games tend to be pretty stressful.
---
Good luck with that!
---
LEATHERFACE FUCKS ME WITH HIS CHAINSAW BUT I AM 5 METERS AWAY

Hey, do you happen to be a switch dbd player? If so, do you know if there is a switch discord for dbd? I’m having a hard time making friends on there, with not really being able to communicate like console/pc.
---
Well what sparked this meme for me was when I was doing a gen and a meg opened a chest right next to me, looked at me and the gen and then turned and ran away lol. Also I definitely see more Claudettes or Neas urban evading around the map then Kates. I agree with the david one even though I am a David main ;)

Return on investment.   Why bother making wide game changing features when idiots will cough up $10 a skin.   Why should they give a shit about fixing a game when its obvious the playerbase will gobble up the latest fugly suit for their character to wear?
---
Wouldn't 亡霊 be more accurate? This is more for ghost or spirits of the departed.
---
Especially when you play spirit and you down someone and they DC or they just see you and BAM gone. Luckily my wait times for killer are non existent but when they were long, it sucked

Why is that true tho

Yeah its getting annoying. Every second game there's people who I'm not even close to in rank, and if not someone DCs and i have to wait another 20 minutes to find a game...
---
I think too many players rely on things like trapping certain loops in expected places. I got the 5 survivors trapped in challenge done by doing traps in unexpected places. For example trapping the blocked window on the outside of the killer shack. Also seriously corrupt intervention might be one of the strongest perks on Trapper. Way more useful than ruin and honestly throws a lot of survivors. It gives you a certain amount of time to get set up with is invaluable for Trapper and don't have to guard anything or hope the totem is not found.
---
yuh. for sure. sent him a message telling him to just take the L like a man next time.
---
BBQ is nice but his other two are great as well, especially Franklin’s. I have ruined countless possible key escapes with it
---
They are def hinting at something. Good catch.
---
She was a child when the entity took her...
---
You can still do it whenever you feel like it, you just won't get rift fragments
---
He 100% could’ve closed that hatch as you were jumping in
---
Either incentivize the killer to play against swfs, or disincentivize the swfs from playing together by making it harder.    
---
Or keep getting lobby dodged and spend another 10 mins in queue while I get another batch of survivors in 10 seconds.
---
There’s no mindgame to it XD.
---
Actually I probably got that wrong the new rank reset does this bc it took people back almost no ranks. 
---
also I been getting rank 20 survivors in my rank 6 killer games
---
The serum does move a little in the vile
---
Everytime I get close the last piece of shit pulls the plug, and because I play on console there is nothing I can do about it since the report system is bogus and they don't get quitter penalties yet!
---
Thx, BHVR!
---
This is the way
---
you dont see fake pallettes when youre awake! so just wake up and it wont matter
---
Pigs killrate and use rate at red ranks is higher than Nurse. 
---
Meaning from a statistical standpoint, Nurse is worse than Pig.
---
Yeah I agree it's pretty good, I looted a two keys, gave one to a team mate and we both escaped through the hatch! This meme originated from when I was doing a gen and a meg opened a chest next to me then took one look at me and the gen and sprint bursted away to the killer shack ;D
---
Also I know it's only a joke but I've had games where people were actively avoiding gens in order to search chests which with one less person doing gens ffor pretty much the whole game is far more likely to result in a loss for the team.
---
I can believe this considering the wait time 😭
---
I actually just did it 3rd try with basement freddy.
---
Agitation, iron grasp, bbq (just for points) and stbfl
---
That’s actually perfect because I’ll be on vacation until the first
---
Statistically and Demonstrably false.
---
pls uninstall, u didnt spark the joy
---
Well shit a new piggy
---
Ah yeah, tbh (and no offense to console players) you can pretty much get away with murder on console. I hit Rank 1 with Leatherface on PS4 and was in for a rude awakening when I came back from deployment and switched to PC.
---
Huge Clown tip then: Cigar Box is decent on PC, OP on console. They will pretty much just run into walls and die.
---
This is most likely the next chapter
---
It does make it impossible to control your camera when you go in for the save though
---
It counts as an escape on the end of game screen so I thought it would. No idea why it wouldn’t count!
---
as of right now it seems that crashes will be punished it is unfortunate but if u ask me the DC penalties are dumber then the new rank reset system
---
3 Gens are effectively impossible without 4 people
---
Investigator, cult. I like where this is going.
---
My personal theory is that every Tome we'll get a look at a killer and survivor duo that we'll never actually see for just lore purposes. I could very well be wrong though
---
Nice job taking my videos and not even asking to upload them. You even said it was you who did those spins against the demogorgon.
---
They reworked tome 3's challenges so it's not impossible to say they'd rework these ones
---
did i just get silver on this? cool.
---
First I was like "where did you get a Superman skin?!" but then I realized you already play a much cooler character.
---
Honestly wouldn't even be upset. I love the lore.
---
Idk probably i have the same issue with my mother tongue lol
---
She was a farmer
---
very true *which is why I said get lucky I dont think I am wrong it is luck*
---
Thanks for sharing your views on the topic, I do think Wraith has better map pressure as he can start off strong in early game and still excel in late game. I definitely prefer Otz’s play style when it comes to Trapper, setting up traps around a 3-can be very deadly if you’re willing to sacrifice gens at the start. I honestly view Wraith as a better Legion, I like to use my cloak to quickly catch up to survivors and hit them with thanat and sloppy while being able to easily switch off targets and use pop or surveillance to try and slow their gen game. They either have to waste time healing or focus gens, letting me get easy hooks as they can’t really catch up to me. I usually run addons that increase my speed while in cloak and decrease the time it takes to de-cloak
---
I understand what you're saying. I think most people just read your first sentence and called it a day. But I gave you an upvote :)
---
True but if the survivors weren't toxic it wouldn't turn  the killers toxic the next game. Cause then it causes a cycle of toxicity among them.
---
#BIRTHDAY!
---
Makes sense, I’ll ask you since you’re on of the few Demogorgon mains I’ve met, is Demo viable at higher ranks compared to other strong killers such as Billy, Spirit, etc?
---
If you mean specifically the 4 basement kills, play a proxy Trapper and make basement so full of traps it's like Thailand. Basement Trapper always works.
---
Get yourself a jersey and toolbox and the look is complete.
---
Yep lmao it’s really just a huge cycle
---
I usually run that and the exhaustion add on.  Mainly cause it's funny watching them try to dead hard.  
---
Yeah like I don't sweat it on DBD cause I hate not having fun like billy is so strong but omg it's just like playing Mario Kart and I hate it!  
---
Yeah console most people are kinda trash hence why I just use fun killers
---
Yee
---
Why are gen skill checks so hard? 
---
Why does he always run straight at me after hooking someone?
---
HOW DID HE FIND ME? I WAS HEALING BEHIND TOTAL COVER WITH IRON WILL?
---
Nah it looks good to me
---
Lol I don't get why killers are too damn scared to take a little stun even WITH enduring like its annoying but its not the end of the world unless its some dash to the open door kind of shit
---
I've never thought of this! Thanks OP!
---
Not kill your friends, I promise.
---
By all accounts treatment mode is going and he's just always gonna have access to Shock Therapy. Which is very good, not needing to stance swap should make ST more useful in a chase.
---
I am stuck in the same debate, not sure what I should spend my shards on, The Clown or a holiday sweater.  But for you, I say get The Plague because I don't see her used too often and all her perks can be useful.
---
All three sacrifices died in the basement. Then I had one survivor decide that they should DC specifically to deny me.
---
Cheers, I spend far too long thinking about this haha.
---
Yeah I think his mobility is a huge factor. If he was 115% all the time then I would give it to trapper.
---
Yeah Otz is my favourite DBD streamer. 
---
I definitely think wraith is a bit better than legion but I also think legion isn't as bad as some people think. 
---
For legion I would likely use something like this:
---
Thana, pop, thrilling tremors and discordance.
---
Add ons: Mural sketch and defaced smiley pin so you have more time to hit all survivors and so you basically have sloppy butcher.
---
Used in this way I think Legion can be quite a strong killer. Keep everyone injured with thana and the mangled from the defaced smiley pin and use thrlling and pop whilst in feral frenzy for gen control. Discordance is to help you find multiple people but whispers could be better if they decide to split up, either way thrilling will also help.
---
Most likely they will just stay injured and gen rush which is where thana and pop will help.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
The number of people who are allergic to doing gens is too damn high.
---
It wouldn’t be so bad if those damn people could just run the killer around. But it always ends up with them on the hook, saved and then hiding / crouching for the next ten minutes doing nothing.
---
yea ive been enjoying using trapper again after not touching him for over a year.  
---
now that i'm better at the game, know the maps better, i can use him to his full potential.  
---
i do the same stuff i do with the hag.  Find 4 or 5 gens that are close together and focus my traps on those.   vault spots, pallets, and random spots between gens.
---
Tear out the tongue to make sure the corpse can't talk
---
Ps4
---
if they removed hook struggling to do it automatically they would have a bigger problem bc now you got AFK survivors.
---
Just in my own opinion the more they fix the game and discourage camping face camping bc that is the simplest to define other camping usually gets lost in what people think is camping. That would make ppl DC less but ofc u cant truly get people to stop.
---
ofc camping does get discouraged by fewer points not that a new player would care or even a seasoned veteran that just plays the game for the hell of it *also yes I've met people with more than 1k hour in the game that finds camping fun* but I'm not gonna shit on him. 
---
But yes I agree it ruins the fun but what more than less points can they do about camping perks already reward leaving said hooked person like MYC or BBQ and probably more I can't really remember. Balance in this game is hard bc it is such a special game other games like it have all died Friday 13th and Last Year idk what else is like DBD.
---
Very good advice actually, wish I knew that sooner ;D
---
If survs aren’t able to dodge a sweaty p3 spirit I don’t see why killers should be able to dodge SWF. People talk about SWF on here as if they’re all terrible people and how dare they play together but like in reality they’re usually just friends trying to have a good time and play together and I don’t think they should be punished for that.
---
Think about it this way: you say you feel like you're missing out on progressing your characters, but you're forgetting about the most important character of all - yourself.
---
Have you been putting the time into leveling yourself? Your health? Education? Career? Social life? Family? I can always sink time into this game and level my characters, unlock new perks, but then I'm missing out on putting the time into progressing me. Upgrade yourself (job, education, gym, social life), and unlock new perks (opportunities, knowledge, friends). 
---
If I were to choose, I would always chose me over DbD.
---
I'm not defending the dcs and i don't dc either but this game has tons of bugs that sometimes it will make you dc even if you don't want to. 
---
I can't really say there shouldn't be a punishment for dc but giving people a time out is not the best idea. Lobby times are already a huge problem in this game and giving someone a hour of queue ban will only make the lobby times become worse.
---
People are assholes
---
AND A DROP RATE OF NEGATIVE 1 APPARENTLY
---
Wow, that’s a lotta bloodpoints.
---
I’ll definitely have to try that next time I play Legion, I’m not really that good with them so I usually just run the standard build that consists of thanat, sloppy, ruin, and bbq lmao
---
did you have the perk equipped
---
Glad I could help!
---
It means the survivors realized they aren’t going to escape in 2020 so they’re trying to delay the game as long as possible.
---
yeah they do oh my lord. they should implement something when a killer is looking at a hooked player or is within a very tight radius for too long, to where it makes them walk a lot slower, and deducts points. like the entity laughs in their face and punishes them for being way too unfair to the survivors or some shit. i've thought on it a lot, honestly. 
---
i don't know why you said that dumb passive aggressive shit at the end, i have over 900 hours in the game, camping is bodyblocking, which is against the rules, and i'm super against that shit. in now way is bodyblocking a part of the game. i think it's funny when all 3 people gang up to unhook a camped player and everyone lives though, that shits pretty sublime lol
---
Money 💰 💰 💵
---
well they are incompetent sooo yeah
---
moving things in the side of my vision triggers my killer nerves I even get confused when I hear my own footsteps like "IS THAT SURVIVOR" or when I rustle the grass "IS THAT A SURVIVOR"
---
its more like the killer has bigger problems to worry about. with at least 1 other person busy not doing gens the  killer will probably look for someone else to pressure them more
---
That’s amazing! I was hoping us plebs would get a moving charm like the fog whisperer ones yay!!
---
Isn't Legion teens? I doubt the Entity has a shit  ton of AXE BODY SPRAY^(tm) for them
---
dumb lol. yeah the ranking shit is out of whack, but at the same time, some people are "rank 17" with all tier 3 perks and a full loadout, so you just never know. people DC'd enough to drop their rank real low, so then everyone gets jumbled in the mix x.x
---
I tried queueing for killer 3 times in my past. Never managed to get into a game. An hour total wait time and no game. Guess I'll main survivors.
---
can confirm, am Japanese
---
How many of the updates have been half assed though?
---
**Ron Swanson:**
---
&gt;*“I learned a lesson. Never half ass two things. Whole ass one thing. So if you wanna win that seat.”*
---
How do we know that it was your video?
---
Survivor's think the killer exists as a bot so they can farm bloodpoints and rank up. Any slight deviation from this is toxic behavior.
---
Im so curious as to like.. what platform or region or..maybe rank? Is experiencing 15 minute killer queues. Mine are almost instant, every friend i talk to has a similar experience, and every streamer i watch (except fungoose) has almost instant killer queues. Survivor on the other hand..
---
yea this new rank reset has rly made this happen more
---
I really hope 18 year olds aren't using axe body spray
---
FUCKING FACECAMPERS ARRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!
---
So strange, I have the exact opposite issue. I can never get into a killer game, get survivor games in 5 seconds.
---
I agree with what your frustrated against, but you're not gonna convince them by yelling like that. Provide better alternatives and be friendly so more can come to the pro-consumer side.
---
I definitely agree this is difficult. With no easy answer. And I've had lots of thoughts about it. Protection zones around hooked survivors. Movement penalty. Borrowed time as standard. 
---
I play both survivor and killer so I feel I have a relatively balanced view. Teabagging and Face camping have made me stop playing this game for days on end.
---
&gt;To the boiler room
---
Must be on Pre-school
---
That mirror add on is seriously powerful with tier three whispers
---
Wtf is Ace doing tho?

It was the wrong perk hahahahahahah
---
Amanda wouldn’t smell very much she always comes out of the mask with makeup no blood so it’s a clean pigs head.
---
HES GETTING A CHASE THEME
---
Yeah, you have a point there, but that could still be argued for the other "clean but still mean", so I kind of wanted to discount general body odor.   
---
"Clean but still mean" is kind of a generalization. 
---
Yo I just realised tho props to Amanda for deadass wandering around in a rotting pigs head
---
I am at rank 6 as a killer and I am getting rank 20 survivors that don't even know how to loop me idk what to blame anymore I just want it fixed cos it can't be fun for high ranking survivors to get new players on their team. Plus just bc u have all t3 perks doesn't mean much you could be a P3 survivor or killer and still be trash ive seen plenty of them
---
Me too, that's why I propose to incentivize playing against SWF so killers would hopefully dodge them less too
---
Are you sure? I thought it was a rotting head? If not, I might move her down to stonk as it would probably still stink a bit.
---
I have a lot of people on twitch (Killer mains) that just say, it's a way to play the game. Camping is valid. We don't ask you to rescue people. And that winds me up almost as much as the camping lol
---
maybe it is a plastic head
---
My pleasure ;)
---
Idk man I live in Brooklyn I don't even notice the sounds anymore 🤣
---
and I have proved a point I made in another post long ago right try again man GLHF
---
That's a given. I either heal you under the hook or you follow me. I'm not the one that needs healing.
---
The add-ons that got leaked shouldn't be considered their final state. Treat them as the ideas they're fucking around with rather than the finished package.
---
I've done this once on purpose only because the DemoDog was camping, and wouldn't leave the hooked survivor. We got him off and all escaped, so do I still go to the Boiler Room?
---
If you rub yourself up against his body and he does not kill you, he is taking the game hostage.
---
If he does, then he is just trying to prevent people being lured away for the gens to finish up, he shocks you into tier 3 to keep a bead on you, amd he really isn't holding the game jostage any more than you are.
---
Therefore, if you've lost hope, just don't run away.
---
Whatever you say, pal, I don't give a shit. I feel that getting a 4k while playing clean is much more satisfying, but to each their own.
---
I’ve used it a few times for survivors hiding with iron will, very rare but if I do see blood ik a survivor is nearby
---
New player here and honestly I dont know how people handle all the negativity when playing the killer. I actively walk to the other side of the map when I hook even when I know they are waiting behind a tree to unhook and still get called a camper. I try to play fair all I get rewarded with is teabagging survivors at the exit gate.
---
I am more thinking 
---
what if a survivor is looping close enough to the hooked survivor should the killer be punished?
---
what if the killer is about to leave but someone pops in right in their face should the killer be punished?
---
That is usually what I think about
---
Could be, never established in lore or even the movie(?). Would move her to bottom if so.
---
I doubt serial killing teens would care
---
True
---
the real mysteries of the saw movies
---
Literally scheduled to coincide with my work week. It’s scheduled to run Thursday to Sunday and I’m off Monday and Tuesday. Would it kill them to give us a solid week around Christmas?
---
Literally had someone do this in the last game I played
---
Like, I'm hooked on the corner of the killer shack, I have Kindred so everyone can see David looping them and won't get me, and they aren't doing gens, just crouched and watching from the far corner of the map. Bye.
---
It's just an orange bar that doesn't even go down. You have to be absolutely brainless to go down to it.
---
'Would smash'
---
this last update has made it kinda CPU heavy for me at least which is weird
---
I don't know if anyone's done the math, but the issue is that the rarity of the node is decided before the item. Green *nodes* are more common than red ones, but there are so many possible green items and offerings that any *specific* green item is probably rarer than the ultra-rares.
---
Whoa whoa whoa, cool it man. I can tell you like to type up a storm in those end game chats. What is '' playing clean ''? Everything is a valid strategy and it's up to the person how they wanna play their game. The only people that think anything is dirty are toxic themselves.
---
I am just leaving them bc if the killer comes where the fuck are we gonna run
---
Another build I have seen is where you run Nemesis and play with your food alongside discordance and pop or ruin and if they stay injured then you will down them very easily because you will be moving at 125-130% speed most of the time. due to play with your food and the obsession change on nemesis. Throw in the add on so that you also apply the mangled effect and they will likely stay injured.
---
I'm not a great legion myself but I've seen his potential in other players and I certainly no longer think he is the weakest killer in the game.
---
Then when you finally get in a game it’s a billy with an ebony mori but if you get close to escaping he dc’s even with the new penalty
---
I’ve seen that build as well, not on legion though. So far I’ve seen it on Billy, Leatherface, and Michael
---
when does it end?
---
Perks aren't going to help you as much as learning how to mind game at loops.  Scott Jund has a great video on youtube called "How to run generic tiles as killer."  Check it out if you haven't seen it.
---
I learned today that the 100% limit isn't a thing. You can't stack multiple instances of we'll make it, but you can stack any other heal bonus on top of it (ex. botany knowledge, med kit, dying light bonus)
---
Both because this game is spaghetti coded and unoptimized af
---
You have to have the perk on and if you kill them all before 5 gens you're fine also. As long as they don't open a gate you're fine.
---
The flavor text for her cosmetics say it’s a real, rotting pig head with “runlets of pus”. She kinda nasty
---
rank update error flashbacks
---
Her cosmetics describe it as a rotting pig head with “runlets of pus”
---
oh my...bless u!
---
Which literally does not mean that her power is worse... literally means that more people
---
Play pig power wise pig will NEVER compare to nurse also if you are using the bhvr statistics they were already stated to be very inaccurate
---
But it has the status icon of a sacrifice, and not of a kill. Why would they make it like that?
---
Imagine he would still play DBD 🙏
---
I’ve played it with a 1050 2gb for quite awhile with no issues so I’m inclined to say cpu.
---
Code red everybody this man about to ruin BHVR forever, guess I'll have to play last year instead.
---
Uhhhh. Where did they say the statistics were inaccurate. 
---
Also, furthermore. The counterplay to Pig is more intricate. Mindgaming the crouch and getting boxes is more stuff to do than what you do against Nurse. One juke and then just run in a straight line. She’ll waste far too much time trying to catch you.
---
It's a really dumb power
---
Remember killers! Downing a survivor is tunneling and not disconnecting after hooking is camping.
---
it is very simple you see CALL HIM THE RIGHT NAME AND BE NICE
---
Funny enough, my survivor queues are 1 min max (green rank 12) however my killer rank after reset is just base 20 still cause i CANNOT find a game for the life of me it’s so frustrating cause i wanna play both sides ya know?
---
People at low ranks would probably be more successful with LF than with Billy. Doesn't tell us about their actual relative strength.
---
The Grandmaster stats would rather tell us about killers' strength at the highest level of play, which is truly not the developers' or players' goalpost (in general). 
---
But on the lower ranks it's harder to judge characters' relative strength because matches are generally decided by who makes less mistakes in base aspects of the game. There you will climb up in process of learning where to go and when to hit M1, powers' balance doesn't even come into play below red ranks.
---
Also, if stats at lower ranks are the same as on the high ranks it means their matchmaking is more or less working as intended, and a graphic of rank distribution of individual killers' mains would be a more telling statistic for lower levels of play.
---
I saw someone use play with your food on oni, really caught me off guard haha. I could see it with infectious fright on Myers for sure! I think nemesis + play with your food moves Leather face up quite a few rankings and turns him into mid rank killer
---
Insulting Bing Bong Man is a sin...
---
you can see his appearance he "shimmers" also he cant hit you unless he uncloaks so just take him for a loop ride...when he starts to uncloak he will slow down in most cases and it takes awhile....so continue to loop...then pallet drop his ass and furiously teabag spam to assert dominance
---
So did the update ruin matchmaking even more? Played several games with noob killers and I'm rank 4.
---
Yeah man the DC penalty will surely deter people from DCing. Oh no you have to wait a minute.
---
If someone is gonna be an asshole and DC solely to prevent your challenge getting completed, they’d probably do it no matter the penalty.
---
Well I was playing the game when leatherface came out, so no time at all
---
No problem. Any time my man, shoot me a message of you have more ideas
---
She wasn’t being toxic, she wanted to bait a swing. God the people on this sub.
---
On PC, it's those arrows to the right if the text box that minimizes the chat.
---
people always feel the need to state what they do in this game. "as an altruistic and aggressive survivor main, I.."
---
$20 game+numerous DLC packs+numerous DLC cosmetics+battlepass.

u saying doctors burned flesh doesnt smell
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
I’m currently rank 12 survivor and keep ending up with lower rank teammates. I kinda blame my friend for that tho lol, he’s rank 15. But when I’m playing killer and get put against rank 17-20 as a rank 15 I just feel bad and wish I could have seen it beforehand
---
the point is that thats definitely what they’re gonna do
---
this
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).

&gt; so just wake up
---
Mid chase? Because fake pallets don't matter outside of chase.
---
Looks pretty on point. Noice.
---
You will never get rid of them completely. Some will get banned and new ones will pop up. I’ve dealt with dick heads in every online game, it’s not just a DBD problem. Honestly it’s probably worse in more competitive style games like Call of Duty and Gears of War 
---
Your best bet is to just ignore them and report them. If you engage with them, you’re feeding the troll
---
Kindred and iron will are super good.
---
Drop lightweight and use either an exhaustion perk, quick and quiet or urban.
---
Drop self care because it’s a waste of time and if you aren’t that great at looping the killer then I would recommend being more stealthy with spine chill or urban.

---
Excellent, i'll have to remember that in case I run in to anyone else who asks.
---
&gt;If you rub yourself up against his body and he does not kill you, he is taking the game hostage.
---
Wow it's like I'm talking about a "hostage" doc or something and that's the point.
---
He shocks you to tier 3 so you can't do gens. If you stick close to him he will just shock you again and he will have an easier time doing it.
---
There's a difference between Potential and Potency. Every killer can get a 4k, but some killers cannot consitently get good results without a good toolset. You can play the worst killer like Legion but if you play well you can still get a 4k with the right perks. However Nurse can consitently get these results without perks because her toolset is 10x better than legion
---
I got lucky that i had potato survivors that camped the basement and managed to get this challenge completed. BHVR needs to remove "complete this challenge in 1 match" so people stop dcing and ruining games

I know, It's almost as if giving context to your statement would be silly.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecvigj/great_deal/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

i made a neutral point, wasnt hating or even replying to your post at all... and you got all defensive. all i said is that this sub makes it seem like its not a friendly community because everyone just complains about how people play. im not exactly sure why you seem so offended or feel the need to even try to discredit my opinion.
---
That’s weird since Joe Keery is 5’11 and Bruce Campbell is 6’1
---
So it shall be.
---
This game keeps attracting more and more toxic shit. This game is gonna die soon. Devs aren’t doing anything to make the game interesting. (Actively making it worse)  Just quit playing.
---
I always tell myself if the last doesn't struggle they get hatch. It is frustratingly annoying trying to give the last survivor hatch when they keep wiggling.
---
GETTING HOOKED BUT I HAVE DELIVERANCE BUT THEY’RE A FACE CAMPING ONI WITH BLOOD RAGE READY
---
Some of these are just plain cursed
---
you earn cosmetics in the battlepass as it helps you level if you are 70 already then no they do not matter at all
---
you keep saying its comedy and i never said it wasnt though...
---
When Claudette cosplay kappa?
---
10/10, spot on, imo !
---
Bro ur camping it too. Git the fuck outta here otherwise I’ll report u
---
Ah yes, the most unfun, boring kind of match. Honestly, I really would prefer rift challenges that don’t encourage people farming me off the hook or camping me in the basement or encourage people to play like scumbags. Challenges like “Complete 10 generators” or “Hit survivors with your weapon 20 times” etc. are what the rift needs to encourage and move towards imo. For people to not be incentivized to play like assholes in a game where people already play like assholes.
---
My god dude, this is every game for me i load into a match and get a dress meg trying to pull me on an infinite, then i see a god damn dwight spint into the locker near by (Not as a distraction, just as a dwight) so i get my 4k and see a rank 20 David a rank 17 Dwight a Rank 12 Blendette and a rank 8 Meg
---
Thanks, I think it's a matter of personal opinion on how to play this game and have fun. Generally it's thought that to emphasize your enjoyment over the others is considered toxic, or salty. I think camping is exactly that, prioritizing your enjoyment of the game over the others. But again, that is a matter of personal opinion.
---
I was matched against rank 15-20 survivors as rank 4 killer a lot yesterday. It was really oblious during the matches so I even tried to farm once with those who were still alive but they were so scared that they continued to run away even after juggling
---
I have a similar playstyle and build. Right now I’m running Kindred/Lithe/Quick and Quiet/Dark Sense. But I’m thinking about switching Dark Sense our for Alert or Iron Will once I unlock it.
---
Trapper. Hook one in the basement and the rest will come.  Set traps around the shack. Easy Peasy.
---
I was in the same boat and got Spirit. Best decision I've ever made. Haunted grounds works amazing with Hag's perks and spirit fury is great with anyone, not to mention her power itself which is amazing.
---
^
---
This really helps you see how ugly the survivors faces are
---
Spirit or clown. Clown is actually worth it just for his perks alone, bamboozle and pop goes the weasel are some of the best perks in the game.
---
With the other suggestions I’m looking at Kindred, possibly Bond/Spine Chill/Empathy (whatever’s best to keep tabs on killer), Iron Will, and Lithe.
---
Or Hybridpanda. He's chill too. And funny.
---
Pretty much
---
Bro and i hate being killer when this happens cuz im like "sorry i dont wanna camp, but i cant just let him go"
---
Yes, but in DBD they are pretty much joust model updates. Most males has one models, and same with the females. Some might have slight difference in weight/height/size but most of the time it's one model.
---
I commit to giving the hatch. I will down you and drag that wiggling ass all the way there no matter how long it takes. You are being saved!
---
Message the survivors and ask if they wanna farm

Nemesis &amp; Furtive Chase for Obsession hooking. Knocked out the obsession hook challenge in two games.
---
farming is initiated by the killer. you just have to happen to land on one
---
I've found the same happened to me too. 
---
I'm a survivor main and picked up killer last month, survivor players can be real asses.
---
I got to rank 17 and also got trolled by a group of 4 flash lights on a level 2 Michael Myers with one perk.
---
It was a very stupid game and they all had a meta build.
---
Now I'm ranking between 12 and 7 (sometimes I go up to rank 12 because I'm not using optimal builds because I'm trying to farm BP with bbq and chili or learning a new character) but it's also an easy way down to rank 7 usually.
---
Once you're rank 12 and under you can't ever get a fair game aswell, you get trolled by purple and red ranks even though you're not on that color yet.
---
They are always being smart asses with tbag and flashing and if they piss you off and you decide to slug and camp with small rotations, they insult the life out of you.
---
Doubt it unless they can work out a deal with Charlie Clouser.
---
If survivors go to an infinite just ignore them and look for someone new.
---
You werent rude at all! I’ve heard it differs from console to console and i’m over here like;
---
*y no crossplay?* 
---
Thank you though!
---
Loser
---
a hag mori'd me as elf dwight and she said "sorry but, that skin had to die.."
---
I’m guessing this is so they don’t have to constantly adjust hit boxes and give players unfair advantages for choosing someone with a smaller hit box.
---
Leave how? By Disconnecting? Pretty sure the killer could do the same.
---
&gt; felling stressed and fatigued
---
You mean blinded and looped?
---
So you are going for an Ukiyo-e type of art?
---
Look, In hopes I hope it's a silent hill connection. Heather Mason, was the center of The Order, a cult worshiping the darkness and keeping it away. I would love a connection like that in the game.
---
Im pretty sure they meant for survivors healing the hooked person
---
Looks great!
---
Says you...? I personally prefer long even matches on both killer *and* survivor because those are the games that make you actually stressed out and spooked. Sitting on different gens for the duration of the whole game just doesn't do it for me, the chase is when the real fun starts imo.
---
He's looking for his lost ankles.
---
Looks great! I think it would be just perfect if wore just like meg
---
&gt;You can't just DC. It isn't fair to anyone -
---
Pretty sure that a survivor DC-ing is more destructive than the killer DC-ing. Lol.
---
These are people who DC when they go against a killer that they dont like/survivors that can loop
---
Wait there's another one sharing them. I have a group chat with him and another friend but he doesn't have reddit so he wouldn't share them. He is claiming they're his and has no proof to back him up if you call him out
---
Pay attention to your surroundings, Bellboy is a low tier killer, you should not have problems once you get used to the game.
---
i Do :&gt;  https://www.instagram.com/no.ed_cosplay
---
Why keep chasing the same guy the whole game?...
---
Happens to me all the time
---
It does say to just finish gens so if you can finish off 4 gens, you good.
---
you know whats better than a double bloodpoint event?........TRIPLE
---
Uhhh. The statistics are instantly inaccurate considering it’s based on player skill and not actual red ranks or such just general player skill
---
It jumps up from seconds to minute to 15 to 30+ to literally hours.
---
It's not a minute.
---
I really appreciate behavior looking out for all of us who are on vacation starting tomorrow and back to work starting the 2nd.
---
Don't want to get into it too heavily, but the House says he's guilty and we need the Senate to approve it.
---
This could mean he's out, it also could mean nothing happens.
---
If you have Plunderers and Pharmacy it takes like a minute tops to find and loot all the chests on the map depending on how many coins were dropped and the map size.
---
I have always gotten same amount of bp with survivor and killer.
---
Wiki says 20m
---
Legion is fun and not as bad as people say but spirit seems like the best choice as she’s so powerful
---
That would be great
---
I couldn't even bring myself to buy it as to not support the devs. The dedicated servers completely screw the game over and it's apparent they have no idea how to fix the net code issues. I think they realize that they just ought to milk the remaining player base as the game's life cycle is going downwards. Just look at the steamcharts. The only reason the game keeps going is because of the low entry price and monthly free trials. It's a good product for attracting new people but not for retaining them.
---

i just dont think his friends care to play due to just not understanding the game.

i dont blame em, game is hard to learn when you're just starting out.
---
Attempt 5. Suffocation Pit. Three basement sacrifices. The last one crawled to the corner of the map so that even with Iron Grasp and Agitation I couldn't get her to the basement. Was told to eff myself for trying.

When your teammate is pointing at your locker indicating that someone is in there for the killer and you come out:
---
I got it say one without realizing it doesn’t give any bonus exp. I’ve got like 4 levels left and I’m done.
---
Suicide on hook.
---
A killer who DCs stops the game for everyone.
---
&gt;Smol Meg
---
That being said good job on the hair
---
You catch and kill them...you outgamed them.
---
I've already screenshot this whole thing, y'all getting banned.
---
Looking at your username, I think you shouldnt be friendly towards someone playing killer
---
Nah it's only 20
---
I hate when people wiggle 
---
Sometimes I just keep at it trying to find it before they wiggle off but they just kewp wiggling even though we're passing hooks faster than crappy diners in a small town
---
You could take them there only for the last hook. Less people will care when they're going to die anyway than when they think it's gonna be insidious camping for the rest of the game.
---
That's alot of damage!
---
and it works
---
Actually you be surprised on how many times I've gotten easy hits with that perk on Huntress.
---
thanks for posting this! i love height comparisons
---
If u use sprint burst, most of the times you'll get a head start, when you see the killer u just run, in that case, most times you wont need to use spine chill
---
If the killer DCs, everyone gets kicked out and possibly has to wait 10+ minutes for another game.
---
"If she's so good, why nobody plays her"? As I told in my first post, if only the chosen one can be good at her, she's not stronger than any other killer, because every killer has their chosen ones that always do very well with them, while ALSO maintaining their popularity, unlike Nurse. It seems Nurse's Potential isn't high enough anymore to attract new players.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).

Attempt 6. Mother's Dwelling with corner basement. Enough said.
---
Wait you guys get paid?
---
Close up bing-bong action? I wouldn't say no to that!
---
Ok, whoever you are please stop claiming ownership on my posts
---
Bruh.
---
Except the easy hits weren’t from the perk they were just from dumb survivors.......
---
ohhhh yes :3
---
Hey! That's on a different comment thread, get that shit out of here.
---
Legion is a worse doctor at this point
---
These perks sound like complete acid
---
I don't use DS anymore because my whole strategy works around it and I just don't get to trigger it. It still has uses as an anti-tunnel perk though. But that is more of a punishment for a killer playing badly than a benefit for me. But as you say - it can be very impactful to the killer.
---
I find Adrenaline best with SWF.
---
Why wouldn't it be? Send me a chat request to discuss.
---
Nurse will just make you depressed, shell of what she used to be
---
Well clown has a lose base on John Wayne the same person who inspired it/pennywise
---
Yes. Send me a chat request to discuss.
---
Too toxic?
---
Still, I guess its quite ironic for you to have that username while your flair is a knife emoji

Guide 1: dont play this game  
---
I am good at this
---
Le epic 4chan tier memes
---
Funny how the Stranger Things DLC added the tallest survivor and the shortest survivor with one update. Nice.
---
Gotcha is too powerful. I'd say give it 2 charges at most.
---
Maybe back then it was useful, idk (I started playing DbD around March this year). Now its just trash.
---
I'm sorry I thought you could
---
I'm waiting to find out this is not legit 😂
---
Welp if they dont bring winter theme back this year im using all the iri heads on my huntress, blame bhvr for cutting my favorite theme. Now i gotta mute lobby music and listen to the one i want through youtube 💪😤
---
'Yeah you played well, I'll let you go' *~Wraith who's been looped for 5 gens straight*
---
 I took this picture from my phone, edited the picture and it’s not even a monitor, it’s a tv.
---
Nurse is still the best killer. Losing LOS is the only real defense for survivors but as nurse you have to predict where they will be and that comes with experience. If a survivor is juking you and predicting your blinks then you have to start becoming unpredictable with her blinks and blinking where they wouldn’t expect you to be. Also blinking to gens to check them is fine but just walk around (or float around teehee) once you get there you don’t need to blink everywhere to just look. Then when you think no one is there blink away to the next gen. When I first started playing nurse and couldn’t find people at times that I knew were working in gens I ran surveillance so I would hit the gen blink away and then know they were still there and blink immediately back when the gen turned yellow. Playing nurse requires a lot of lost games before you get good at her. I 4K almost every game with her no matter the map. The only map I struggle with is rotten fields because frick the corn lol.
---
No I don’t want a debuff just because every model doesn’t have to be the same....
---
Watch me!
---
Wait really. Between the ridiculous free to play micro transaction model and overall lack of polish on this game I figured it was being made by a super small team :/ I mean graphics aren’t everything but this game literally looks and feels like a mobile game sometimes.
---
Your point is…?
---
Pig's power becomes slightly better when you sorta realise that the point of traps isn't to get kills, the kills are just the threat to have players actually try to get the hats off. Pig's traps are honestly better as a game delay function, because survivors have to do boxes instead of gens. But they're entirely RNG based so they're still pretty bad.
---
I think he was talking about Wraith's addons too.
---
I hope you all realize this is exclusively a reddit thing
---
I can't count how many times I accidently did this as a rank 20 survivor.
---
I have no problem with then looping. Once you teabag me I camp you the whole fucking time. You are my goal 💀
---
scrolling down I thought this was going to be the mediocre Night King death
---
thank god i was wrong
---
I think you'd look better with the death graden mask.
---
Oh shit this isn't r/roastme
---
No you're literally calling me ignorant and insulting me,  but yet NO one has agreed with you. I'm saying that because obviously, I'm not so ignorant IF other people agree that your idea is fucking stupid. Weird flex to assume so much about someone off of a dead by daylight comment lmfaoooo. "Those people." I'm dead. Haha. Maybe you should get out of the house more buddy..
---
THIS IS A HOT TIP THAT I WILL EMPLOY WITH MY HAG FOR THIS CHALLENGE THANK YOU!!
---
Oh you were being serious, I see. Well I had several games where my team mates literally didn't do any gens because after they got the item out the chest they just kept looking for more chests. But yeah this is a joke not a rant and I made it after I was playing with a meg who did a chest right next to me, took one long at me and the gen and sprint bursted away to the killer shack :D But yes definitely a joke because I did the challenge myself and got two keys and escaped through the hatch haha
---
Its actually the same for BHVR employees. You know why they didn't realize starting an event after vacation time is bad for players? Because they don't fucking play their own game!!!
---
LUCKIPOP YOU ARE WHOLESOME AND WONDERFUL AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG &lt;3
---
I need some tall ladies!!!
---
I rarely see blood.  Maybe why I'm rank 7 not 1
---
I really don't understand what ppl think they are getting out of DCing to deny the challenge - it just makes the killer have to play in an unfun way again with other survivors, it's a lose lose
---
haha xD i think the mask would break :&gt;
---
How come some of the survivors feet don't touch the bottom line
---
This challenge really sucks. Was playing with a friend and the LF asked us to farm, but to let him kill us in the basement after for the challenge. I just wanted to play a normal match, but we said okay to be nice. We put on streamers, did gens then met him in the basement. One of the randos was a jack ass and made him chase her around the map. When she finally got downed near the basement, she dced. The killer not wanting to be topped for jack ass position then dced immediately and we wasted our offerings. Great fun.
---
Wait so you dc’d because they played well?
---
The who? Lol
---
Not sure why you are upset if you tunnel someone with a MORI the whole game then it’s your own fault

That's just a game design flaw. They're worth 1k points now and there is no way for anyone to know you need them.
---
I can't NOT do totems, get fucking noeded at the end of game, just for the off chance that someone has a ln archive it inner strength, and it's worth a lot of points overall.
---
MY BAD CUTIE
---
I have spoken.
---
Yep I may be wrong I seen it on wiki as 20m as well
---
Why not use an offering for farm or autohaven to get one of the tiny maps with the shack in the center?
---
My soloqueue teammates be like...
---
True. They only had 364 days to work on it /s
---
Underrated comment
---
Terrifying  lol
---
Oh and I insulted them in chat, do you know if I can get perman ban for that?
---
I was injured the entire time. I had no means of healing (perks, medkits, teammates)
---
you only needed to kill two of them..
---
Touche.
---
Toxic, clearly you were working with the killer.
---
No worries (: just curious, thank you!
---
I'm sorry little one
---
OUTDATED
---
Console seems to have a 4-10min queue time once you reach Rank 12. Goes higher as you reach &lt;9. You pretty much expect A) killer to be +/- 4 ranks or B) there to be a survivor with a rank out of place. Reach Rank 4 and queue times are like 10mins... though not that Rank matters
---
Kay
---
Don’t
---
I got mad because I hate being looped
---
Why not?
---
that's why i don't play anymore, i get so frustrated and bored waiting for a game then it get cancelled ugh....taking a break for now but i love the memes &lt;3
---
I think we need to see how long your legs are, because in that picture she looks about 2 feet tall. Might need to get height reduction surgery to pull off the cosplay.
---
DELETE GENERATORS MAKE IT THAT NO ONE CAN ESCAPE
---
Please tell me I’m being trolled
---
KILLERS GO FOR EASY TARGETS
---
It only downed me once, and it was my first game back from not playing in a year and I had no idea of any of the changes.
---
Nope, I have strong emotions
---
I don't think I've ever seen single decimal IQ before. But today I saw three!
---
Imagine evading Doctor with Ride the Lightning in the background
---
Then get better at the game.
---
Only joking. She’s very difficult to learn, you will get dabbed on... however predicting survivor movements is key for blinking. Chase them for a while normally (without blinking), get a feel of how they move/where they tend to go and then you’ll be able to blink effectively most of the time 😊
---
That's pretty pathetic honestly, stop playing and ruining the game for others
---
And survivors are complaining about killer's toxicity...
---
Based on what? Looking at red rank stats Nurse is trash. Are they suddenly not accurate bc they don’t show Nurse with a 100% killrate?
---
That’s a bit dumb...sadly can’t really fix that though. I mean you do risk fucking over your monitor though by playing stretched so it’s a risk advantage if anything.
---
Thank you for the tips &gt;^.^&gt;
---
Bbq, shadowborn, deviour hope, whispers
---
No problem! Good luck ❤️
---
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SAVE. IT STILL COUNTS IF YOU BLIND  THEM AT THE START OF THE ANIMATION
---
Well I asked for advice, it's not my fault if nobody told me what to do and that every guide is "you have to guess where the survivor is going, because you have power of predicting the future, woo hoo hoo"
---
If you go in with a mori, survivors are gonna gry hard you because you have an insta kill. Not sure what you expect.
---
I knew they use the same base model for all male and female survivors, but are there actual height differences for killers (other than tall and average, of course)?
---
Oh yeah, because everyone has to be calm like the Dalai Lama now

A *sliiiight* brow furrow and you've nailed it.
---
Same here. We need DC husks because entitled survivors think cucking your challenge is worth the ban.
---
This is some Inception-level shit.
---
Idk, as far as i know, no other killer has been based off of a real person besides maybe some of the licensed ones. Unless there is a movie about Belle Gunness or something similar, the chances of her getting added are probably slim. Also, the lore and the podcast don't amount to much proof.
---
Well now I know to never bring a mori again
---
Same with people who teabag and point at you while you do a totem or open a chest. Chances are they have perks related to it (Plunderers, Ace in the Hole, Pharmacy / Inner Strength) and can get more value out of it than you.
---
I feel this in my heart and soul
---
Because the idiots who downvoted the comment are the one who farm
---
Clearly you just got dab harded on
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
That's not the problem. (Well, it can be a problem too.) 
---
The real problem is even if you CAN manage to hook people in the basement, survivors can simply disconnect. If they DC they simply flop down dead and cannot be hooked, meaning even though you're carrying the last survivor to the basement, he can still DC to screw you out of the challenge out of spite.
---
They didn’t cancel it, though.
---
You didn’t ask for advice lmao. You just made a post crying that you got outplayed. Either learn to get better or stop playing.
---
It's just where I remember learning about it  and there has been one clown was john Wayne gayse he is the inspiration for pennywise as well
---
I still would like a glass shard charm to represent decisive strike.
---
Once you get some dirt make up (or actual dirt, idk how cosplayers do it) youll look spot on.  And the outfit of course, but Im assuming you have that together already.
---
Unless it’s something new that I’ve missed I don’t thing there’s anything wrong with it. You’re taking an average killer and playing to his strengths. I don’t see anything wrong with that.
---
If you come in with that overt BT thirst then yeah of course they're gonna leave you alone. It's like poker - if you play like you've got a good hand, people are going to treat you like you've got a good hand unless they know otherwise.
---
I did, I posted on this reddit some weeks ago and nobody bothered to answer. 
---
And it's easy for people like you to say to get better when you're already better. It's like a rich person telling a homeless to go and make money.
---
game of thrones
---
This. I would have gotten the challenge on my fourth attempt except for a single person DCed rather than die in the basement. On my fifth attempt, I had one person literally run to the end of the map so I couldn't get her to the basement even with Iron and Agitation.
---
You look pissed
---
nope i wanted to see if she fits me first. Im actually suprised how much everyone likes it :&gt;
---
If you’re going to cry about not getting your way, you don’t deserve any advice.
---
Let's get an F in the chat for our boy. And bug respect for the killers like this
---
Yeah, his speed boost and faster vaulting help a lot! The other nerfs didn’t affect me much since I didn’t run stbfl or sloppy. I quite like the deep wounds changes since that’s guaranteed time not on gens, but the quicker mending time hurts a bit.
---
I don't think so. It seemed that the only similarity between John Wayne Gacy and Kenneth Chase is that they both look like Clowns.
---
As in the nickname "the Billy"?
---
That's reasonable enough, otherwise.. how?
---
also when you get kicked from the server randomly, which happens a fuckton
---
I would, but you have a sharp object and I'm in no way capable of self-defense.
---
I asked for advice, and everyone was too lazy to answer. It's not my fault if people are selfish and lazy.
---
Yeah, I didn’t get any good perks on him yet
---
Maybe if you need a game you can stop the moment it frustrates you, you should stick with single player games?
---
That's the issue, it's a great challenge, it would be cool as an overall thing some people could be doing for a challenge for this game.
---
The issue however is two fold. First and foremost is promotes EXTREMELY unfun gameplay all around. I'm sure some killers like playing like this, but generally it's not entertaining gameplay, and the counter is to literally idle on gens and hope people struggle to give you all time to punish the camper. They'll maybe get a 2k if you play it right. SWFs generally don't play it right.
---
Next the issue if the tomb exists. These challenges will be WORTHLESS shortly and be nothing more than glorified dailies for loads of BP. Again, fine for the overall game, but given that without the shards from this you're looking at absurd amounts of play time, everyone is doing these challenges now.
---
If you're T70 and complaining then you're an idiot and should realize these are staying forever and you don't need to complete them right this second, but for those of us that need a tier a day, or a good grind for 70, it's just NOT happening without the archives, making them incredibly frustrating.
---
Ace is really skinny, but definitely taller. It's different in a match if you make your survivor point. They stand up straighter. You also realize the survivors aren't as short as they first appear when you point near a killer.
---
I was on Ace and my friend was on Jeff. We were having fun with this Oni and when we would point our survivors were only about 2 or 3 inches shorter than Oni.
---
Comments like these show me why we never get developer visits. Just a bunch of people complaining about a game that you put way too much time and effort in. 
---
Personally it’s a relief to hear there isn’t a seasonal event. I have six or seven games I frequent throughout my week and it’s a blessing that not all of them have a time sensitive seasonal event that pushes me to play if I want the freebies. DBD has Halloween and they really love that stuff, they do awesome every year for it. But because they don’t have a massive get up for Christmas suddenly developers don’t play their own game. Suddenly they hate you all and don’t care about you.
---
It’s true, a toxic Claudette teabagged me after dropping pallets and I tunneled her into oblivion
---
I KNOW! I CAN'T BLIND TO SAVE MY FUCKIN' LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It looks pretty accurate.  Especially the hair.  Im sure the costume wouldnt be too hard to get.
---
THANK YOU FOR SAYING IT, SOME PEOPLE DONT GET THAT EVEN IS A PROBLEM IS SMALL, IT MATTERS TO THE PERSON DEALING WITH IT
---
Holy fuck this is one of the best things I’ve ever seen on this sub.
---
Just weird I guess.
---
Idk man, i just don't think that there is enough information to build something off of. You could be right tho, if she is the next killer, i'll remember what you said.
---
Thanks for the theory.
---
W o o o o s h 
---
     ^ur ^head
---
Nice
---
*^(I was doing this before I even had a reddit account.)*
---
Christmas is ruined. Guess I have to play Clown, with the Santa skin.
---
I think GhostFaces stalk is far better than people realize, 99ing someone is like injuring them without being able to heal and they are completely oblivious makeing them make risker plays
---
you guys are both fucking weird
---
THE THING YOU SHOULD DO IS GO FOR THE GREAT SKILL CHECKS BUT IF YOU JUST END UP WITH A REGULAR ONE OR FAIL ALTOGETHER, WAIT UNTIL THE ANIMATION OF SPARKS AND SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE GENERATOR COMPLETELY FINISH AND RESUME WORKING.    
---
DURING THAT ANIMATION YOU WILL MAKE NO PROGRESS ON THE GENERATOR BY CONTINUING TO WORK EVEN IF YOU WERE TO LAND A GREAT SKILL CHECK DURING THAT PERIOD.
---
its my real hair :D
---
Holy shit you look like Meh, this is spectacular
---
It would be sad if it weren't so humorous. You start off responding to something that doesn't even exist, then hop to multiple tangents, and finally finish off with "yeah you're being a dick for no reason that's why".
---
Yes, I called entitled survivor mains bitches because they want to BM as much as they can, but will cry, like bitches, when it happens to them. Is that me being a dick for no reason or generalizing? Perhaps, but I don't care. I don't need upvotes or some sort of Reddit clique to bolster me when I point out how incredibly selfish and self-centered survivor mains can be. Whether or not the survivor population on this sub is a vocal minority or majority, I don't particularly care, I still will point out these instances of someone being a crybaby who runs to mommy and daddy when they don't get their way.
---
You assume because I get multiple downvotes that somehow that's an indication of being objectively right or wrong, rather than pluralism, which I completely expect after triggering someone and their cognitive dissonance.
---
But hey, you keep on crusading and deluding yourself, if that's what makes you feel good about yourself.
---
You clearly don’t know how a Reddit works.
---
Smol meg
---
Michael is by far the most balanced killer we have in the game. Fun to face, fair kit that is both strong but counterable, and addons that rarely ever feel oppressive and busted.
---
You clearly don't know how selfish humans are
---
That's really on point! Well done!
---
I just got grabbed on my 4th gen at 99%. Feelsbadman. These archives make me wanna kill myself.
---
Nah I get that completely, I just said it because some of OP's other comments ITT mention the map he got for the attempt and why that made it fail.
---
Gonna keep crying?
---
What the fuck is this?
---
I’m totally fine playing against swf AS LONG AS they don’t have perks that could give me a huge disadvantage- like for example “Object of obsession “ They could tell each other EXACTLY what i’m doing or where i am- especially when i play as trapper, Hag, Wraith, Billy and/or Legion. Also playing in red ranks which - trust me when i say this - it is not fun at all. I’m ok with swf- i sometimes play with my friend so i really don’t see an issue in it, but when you play a 3/4 men, 2 have OoO, while the other 2 fix gens (Rush them affaffafaf) isn’t fun for me! Don’t ask WHY killers dodge you and friends! Don’t ask WHY surv lobbies take way too long&lt; Cuz literally nobody plays killer anymore&gt; then bring with you some sweaty-broken ass perks. Bring flashlights? Ok. 4 DS’s, BT, Dead hard? Yeah sure whatever. 2 OoO? Nope I’m outtie! Find yourself another killer who puts up with your shit. 👋

Jesus Christ put Quentin's hair back on..

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecwo4l/just_bought_this_game_but_cant_play_because_i/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Ah yes, one game of dc’s proves this challenge is bad.
---
You never said anything about luck in this reply thread.
---
I like how people in the comments are pouting out extremely powerful add-ons, or coming up with the most unfun bullshit for survivors to face.
---
Yeah, sound about right for this subreddit/community.
---
yeah let me waste more of my time so i can play this broken game. thanks guys
---
Ahahhaha its me when right after loading hillbilly chainsaws precisely into my ass across the map, choosing my generator of all to check
---
was about to comment this haha,
---
the last guy is supposed to say the "good" thing to do, whereas the rest of the people only have bad ideas.
---
She be vibin tho
---
The very popular mobile game dead by sunrise, of course!
---
Gonna keep being self-centered?
---
Yeah man it’s a casual discussion. I like how you think you should be policing it.
---
She's not great at anything anymore. Like half the killer roster has overcome her at this point
---
Just get better at the game and improve your skills.
---
Here I am waiting for rank to actually mean something.
---
That's a lazy advice
---
Yes lets divide the killer player base into people that want to play against sweatier SWF survivors and people that want to play against solo queue survivors.  
---
If you had the choice between the two, wouldn't you just play against the solo survivor teams everytime?
---
January 2nd-7th I believe?
---
Without rank, how would you know if you’re teammates are new or not? Without rank, games would sort people by just servers and queue times. I could be playing with a red, a green, and two browns and the killer could be red.  We actually kinda need rank
---
That isn't supposed to be an either/or thing there buddy.  You're supposed to be able to do both.
---
I hit skill checks.  I loop killers.  You should be able to do both too.
---
Ah, good counterpoint. There isn’t possibly another option less extreme than being calm like the dalai lama.  
---
Either you tunnel, dc and trashtalk them or you have to be like the dalai lama. There’s nothing in between.
---
Killer being able to turn off SWF would increase queue time for both sides, so it's not an option that is on the Dev's lists.
---
I don’t think leather face needs a rework and I don’t know enough about clown.
---
He can shock once every 60 seconds. How is that going to help him.
---
yep
---
This must’ve been the lobby I joined because that literally happened to me earlier
---
Repost bc it didn’t crop
---
I personally like Ruin/Corrupt Intervention, Nurse's Calling, Thanataphobia, and Sloppy Butcher.
---
Best advice I can offer is just learn to predict how survivors move and where they're going to be. After blinking, don't swing unless you're at least 95% sure you'll land a hit. Swinging after a blink slightly increases the fatigue time. Be ready to lose a few times in the beginning and don't worry so much about getting a hook. Once you get used to her ypur first 4K will be incredibly satisfying.
---
There’s literally nothing wrong with checking a chest in the basement. People with less than 50 hours in this game shouldn’t make memes about perceived poor tactics lmao.
---
Exactly. There's a reason why the devs never implemented voice chat into their game. A clear advantage for survivors. They didn't have the foresight that they would find workarounds though like discord and party chat.
---
I don't know how small/big they were before DbD, but I don't think they were all that much of anything previously. DbD was way more successful than they had originally expected, and made them much bigger than I think they could have anticipated. To me it seems like they run things as if they were still that smaller, pre-DbD company, even though their game has risen well beyond that sphere.
---
And we just got another one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecv8w7/survivors\_defauld\_outfit\_height\_comparison/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecv8w7/survivors_defauld_outfit_height_comparison/)
---
You actually downloaded this instead of Identity V? Lol
---
she's smaller than feng?
---
&gt;You have to learn which pallets you need to break and which ones you can leave up.  Also I'm going to assume you're playing huntress, right?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; You should be able to guess when they are going for a pallet drop and hit them with a hatchet when they are locked into the animation.
---
What I meant is that you want me to never get mad or upset
---
oh no.. not Quentin.. my poor boy
---
Someone just did one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecv8w7/survivors\_defauld\_outfit\_height\_comparison/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecv8w7/survivors_defauld_outfit_height_comparison/)
---
What do you mean increase q times for both sides? Don't lump us lone survivors with the swf crowd.
---
shaking my head my head?
---
I think the 7th?
---
Even if it’s intended it’s broken. The gap should be much lower than it is.
---
Yeah. Btw, is Blackwater swamp looping-loaded?

I assume you’re getting the arm sleeve and jersey outfit too?
---
Keep crying. You’re not capable of being on Reddit.
---
Are you trying to argue in favor that 5 basement hooks in a single game using a specific perk is reasonable? Please explain
---
Toxic scum bag hope you die
---
I have never talked to anyone, who enjoys playing against good Doctor players.
---
What do you mean? Most people who use reddit have the mentality of a 3 years old.
---
yep :3
---
Why do you think LeatherFace doesn't need a rework? His ability encourages a camping play style, which I don't know how anyone finds that fun unless it's the end of the match and you have no other choice to get that kill.
---
I agree with you I don't think it is going to be 1 for 1 recreation
---
Yeah, I thought I saw a different pic that showed Jeff and David as being the tallest survivors (before Steve)
---
Clown is good just noting fancy no bells or whistles you need to be good at loops as a killer for him to work good
---
That's really great, thanks! There's just a tiny mistake: if you zoom in you'll notice that their feet are not starting from the same spot. You could fix it by aligning them all to the closet line.
---
Still, good meme.
---
Is for the rank the queue change if you are in the high or low ranks
---
my personal build is BBQ, Infectious Fright, Shadowborn, and Whispers. Nurse has the greatest chase potential in the entire game, as well as decent map pressure since she can just warp through objects normal Killers would have to walk around, so building her purely for tracking like my above build is the standard go too for good Nurse players.
---
however, don't let this tell you it isn't okay to use Ruin. especially if you're trying to learn her or if you're on console like I am. I've gotten used to the fuckery of console Nurse so I don't need Ruin anymore, but for beginners who will most likely get stomped, no shame in using it whatsoever. 
---
general tips I can give you: turn while you're blinking, not after the blink has ended. be very observant of Survivor movements and try to get a feel for their average fakeouts. use your first blink to get within range of a Survivor then use your second blink to readjust and predict movements. never just be floating around, you HAVE to blink to keep your momentum going as Nurse is 96.25% movement speed when floating around, so literally slower than a running Survivor. 
---
and most importantly, keep at it. you'll get stomped, called bad, teabagged, flashlight clicked, etc. just keep at it, you'll eventually get to the point where even without perks you'll be crushing SWF with four commodious toolboxes and every second chance perk in the game.
---
Killer tree is the easiest one this for around.
---
Got 4 survivors in the basement my 3rd try (with freddy btw) and I doubt itll take long to get the dark sense one.
---
Not sure why people act like these are hard.
---
It's almost as if the second half of my comment mentioned this.
---
Oh yeah, that's exactly how people are. They ignore the person and when they snap, they say "well I was about to help you, but I won't". BE HONEST, SAY THE TRUTH!!!
---
You were never here when I asked for advice, so don't play the "I was about to help, but I'm not because it's your fault". A lot of manipulators and cowards use this card because they want to play the Saint and so-above it facade, but the truth is that you are a lazy bum like 99% of humanity.
---
You think about yourself and you pretend that you care and that you are a good person, but the truth is that like most of humans you are selfish, hypocritical and coward. Shut up with your fake charity.
---
happy to help.
---
Do you smell burnt toast?

As evidenced by theirs

Thanks for being civil

---
I'M SICK OF SURVIVORS DC'ING BEFORE I CAN GET MY SIX FEET UNDER CHALLENGE I JUST WANT MY LORE
---
Clicking while you're already being chased is toxic regardless
---
I wish I had Nemesis, I guess I can use Furtive Chase, it can switch the obsession too.
---
Lol.
---
I have about 500 hours in the game and it’s probably crashed twice so idk about that one.
---
It wasn’t a click? She was blinding him.
---
nice i didnt even think of that, it was too new a perk. i used a different one where if they unhook the obsession then they become it. took me 2 or 3 matches. i forget, yesterday is all a blur. a DBD blur. lol. such a hangover today
---
Who isn't?
---
I tried to leave twice before. Nothing comes close to scratching this itch. See you soon.
---
death is not an escape.
---
She was clicking
---
You know, normally I’d leave by now. But this is actually funny. Everyone who’s seen this post thinks you’re an idiot. You want to continue making everyone think that?
---
Yeah. And if they updated their graphics and textures and animations and stuff. I know that graphics don’t matter in the grand scheme of things but this game could be so much more beautiful, currently its so low quality and “videogame” looking. Also, idk if anyone else has this issue, but queue times (especially as low rank killer) are absolutely abysmal and have actually made me not want to play killer. How am I supposed to rank up and find games faster if I can’t even play the game because of my low rank.  Also this game’s hit detection and netcode is so frustratingly inconsistent, in addition to bugs and subjectively broken mechanics like mori’s and keys. I fkn love this game and there’s nothing else like it but I feel like it could be SO much more than it currently is.
---
I have a long history of providing detailed paragraphs to inquiring players on here hoping to improve their killer and/or survivor play.  I actively participate on those help threads all the time.
---
The way you are conducting yourself in this thread is appalling.  I read every response.  You are childish immature, selfish as all hell and think everyone owes you something here.  We don't.  If you acted like a grown up and not a salty little brat I'd have been more than happy to still answer you.  But you aren't a player that deserves it.  You act like a snotty entitled brat on Reddit and in game you contribute to the biggest problem in the game which is the chronic ragequits when a terrible terrible player doesn't get their way.  Mommy and Daddy never stopped letting you win at Candyland did they?  You just flip the board over if you're losing these days.
---
Congrats dude!
---
I don't care about what people think. Jesus and Joan of Arc were also ganged up against.
---
Every killer has the ability to encourage a camping playstyle, his abilities encourage camping but any all killers can camp and have camped.
---
If a killer is camping then literally do the gens nearest to the killer shack and work outwards, if someone is good at looping/baiting then you can trade hooks with the person but if it’s a group of ransoms then good luck.
---
I usually play SWF and we might suffer one or two deaths at the hands of face campers bc we don’t all crouch around the hook and waste time.
---
I love this
---
I just hit them with a gg &lt;3 at the end no matter what happens. Don’t give them the satisfaction of anything. Their only goal is to trigger people.
---
So it is a limit, but the limit isn't what you thought. It just can't stack with itself, checking the wiki, it looks like it used to stack with itself which must have been absolutely bullshit to play against lmao
---
I tried everything. Trapper with 7 traps around basement, Hag with all 10 traps, Insidious Bubba and finally it took survivors pitying me and realizing what challenge it was for me to get it
---
Wiggle perks really don't do anything significant for survivors.
---
Iron Grasp counters Boil Over's increased struggling effect and you should already know where the basement is running a basement build.
---
Flip Flop only matters if you slug someone long which if your goal is to get 5 basement hooks you probably won't slug very often.
---
Breakout might get you if you are far enough away from the basement and survivors body block, but body blocking can be countered with Mad Grit.
---
At worst, you get a bad rng basement that survivors can easily avoid. You can also play around that by forming a 3 gen strat around the basement.
---
Rank def matter my guy. A rank 6 killer can get a game instantly, while rank 6 survivors have to wait just a minute or 2
---
See you next week!
---
you need the jersey!

DAMNIT YAMAOKA ESTATE IM A RANK 10 KILLER IM NOT READY FOR DAMN BLENDETTES
---
agreed i just think challenges that rely on other people not dcing or killing themselves are flawed (same thing as the endgame unhooks and noed endgame hooks)
---
Bro wtf is a 3nd?
---
To The Extreme kinda sounds like a mix between Dance With Me and the new Yui perk (forgot what it’s called) and Courage sounds like a better Streetwise/Prove Thyself. Everything else seems pretty cool
---
You have activated my NOED

FUCK THIS NEW SYSTEM. DEVS WORK YOUR SHIT OUT!
---
Some people just scream the N word like a homophobic machine gun. You do it because you can.
---
Doesn't make the action any less offensive
---
Plague is much better in every way. She is about mid tier, while Legion is bottom 3 and with all the nerfs might as well not exist anymore. Also her perks are really good (yes even dark devotion).
---
heck yeah,thanks for the links! 😊🤙
---
I wish there was a way to communicate that I want to farm on console.
---
Yeah I’m primarily a “gen jockey” as well. That’s why I usually run Dark Sense, so I can see where to head next after finishing a gen. But I’m trying to wean myself off of it because I feel like there are better perks I could use instead.
---
Let me throw more fuel in the fire by also saying Legion is my main.
---
You're being sarcastic but people genuinely believe this. As if they aren't tasked with a new Killer/Survivor and their perks every 3 months, making sure they work as intended as well as having enough playtime in the game to see what's broken and needs to be changed. It's absolutely baffling that even when they let everyone know that they're going to be taking time off events to focus on the health of the game people still get angry.
---
I know you were. Who is going to have the extra headache exactly?
---
Devs have openly said they will never make any events that have special objectives, the only events we will ever get is just gen and hook reskins and double bloodpoints
---
I only give hatch if they had an unlucky game like a DC or an early suicide. If I beat them fair and square no mercy.
---
No, if your trying to unhook youself with a facecamping killer, then thats your own fault. Staying on the hook is one of the only ways to counter face camping as it gives your teamates time to repair several gens. The only time you should EVER try for the 4% is if the killer is far enough away, which makes adding a stun mechanic usless. No, that would just hurt the game.
---
What about toxic dc'ers. Well now they get hooked, go for the 4%, if they get it, yay they are back in the game. If they fail they'll just suicide. Especially with the recent temporary bans on dc'ing. Just no.
---
On console they use their party chat in there. The devs can't do anything about that.
---

No you can't.  There isn't a licensed character in this game you can unlock for free with shards.  They all require actual money not gametime.

Wasn’t she just trying to blind? I didn’t hear a “clickclickclickclickclickclick...”
---
Lighten up, it's  a joke. Also even if I had played less than 50 hours of this game what does that have to do with anything. Really great way of welcoming people into the community.
---
I already mentioned the killers that went to avoid swf, will get longer q times, but If they're smart enough to avoid swf, they're smart enough to know the increase q time. However, for swf, that's the consequences for wanting to have an easier match.
---
Why not just get rid of survivors, and have bots that are controlled by chimpanzees in theBHVR office, killers would have lots of fun and survivors wont be able to dc, plus since chimpanzees are endangered they will have a nice safe home. This will also reduce toxicity, since chimpanzees are usually nice gamers and good sports even when they get camped on the hook.
---
I think you did a pretty good job so far!
---
No. In fact, I think the I-frames on dead hard should be removed. No reason for you to be able to dead hard through a bear trap, chainsaw, hatchet, etc. and it would still be strong without them.
---
How exactly would I know if they are taking me to a hatch ? What about wiggle points ? I want wiggle points before I die, this is such a dumb system.
---
You know nothing about my childhood. I did not had a perfect family and perfect friends like you. I was raised to not trust people and to know that people are all selfish, cowards and hypocritical like you.

---
You failed me, this world failed me. I have the right to be angry at the world, because this whole world failed me.
---
hard to tell. When she use We'll make it on Meg she does it in 10s while 100% healing speed of a normally speed should let you heal in 8s wchich means that Meg might be affected by mangle.
---
Then on David Claudette use her boosted medkit with 4 perks that increase healing speed. Which one of them really affect it knowing that just the medkit + botany already reduce the healing speed to 5s why would it be 4s with We will make it while there is as well Spine chill and Resilience.
---
We'll make it does not stack with other effect/medkit.
---
Why here in the message people are so toxic?
---
You can check the report system yourself, there's only 1/5 tabs that's actually for game breaking/cheating. Unsportsmanlike, Harassment etc.
---
That's actually pretty genius but it is infact so smart that I don't think the survivors will figure it out :D
---
You said it yourself that you wouldn't personally know.  
---
It would obviously be the killer who opted to play against the SWF lobbies who would have the extra headache instead of playing against 4 randoms with no comms between them.
---
Honestly better if it doesnt lag my framerate
---
F U C K you're right
---
Huge buff to survivors and killers with good teachables, big nerf to killers with bad teachables like Huntress, or teachables that just don't fit them well. We don't need to nerf Trapper, Huntress, Wraith, Myers, etc.
---
I like billy, he is fun :)
---
Worry less about the number than the shape.
---
Get yourself in therapy dude.
---
I don't think it's really that much work since it's mostly just running a build that can easily bring survivors into the basement. 
---
Right now the only challenge that I think is poorly designed is the Dark Sense one since if you ever get chased by the killer or hooked for long enough you'll lose out on finishing 4 gens. I would say it's the most luck based challenge since at least the basement ones can be played around with the right set up and strategy.
---
did you ever get a match or are you still waiting?
---
Okay got you this is a troll lol.  Took a while you were selling it as believable in the previous comments.  I don't usually fall for these these days anymore so kudos I guess.  
---
I'm gonna go now though.  I don't do trolls.  But again credit where credits due.  I usually avoid engaging in these period so well played.
---
I'm sorry but the color is way off, style isn't close and the clothing isn't even an attempt. I couldn't call this a cosplay if I was drunk on LSD Moonshine enema's.
---
Depends. On indoor maps, where seeing blood is easier, i always ignore scratchmarks and follow that instead. On Autohaven/Mac Millan Estate/etc, where you can't really see blood in the grass and dirt, scratchmarks are more important. 
---
Above all though, i pay the most attention to sound. After some time, you'll be able to judge the exact distance between you and a survivor you don't have eyes on, purely by listening to how close or far they are. Keep in mind that Iron Will and Stridor can completely fuck up your tracking in such a scenario though.
---
You can complete all the killer challenges with needing to camp.
---
The challenge have been pretty wack for real. Making people play a specific way. Ends up everyone is just being toxic af and tunneling
---
That’s what I just said. It’s even easier for PC.
---
Joke's on you. I am not even a troll
---
Comparing yourself to those now are you? Lmao.
---
My therapist is busy
---
Maybe I just get shitty teammates because doing 4 gens doesnt seem that hard for me to do even when I'm not trying lol. I can see how a proper build would make this basement challenge significantly easier, but I also dont have nearly the diversity of killer perks as I do survivor. Itll likely be a challenge I just dont complete given how reliant it is on perk builds.
---
That's fair enough. I get why this is a bad concept now. You've changed my mind XD
---
Stop it lol.  Have a good day.  You'll get others.  Just do what you started off doing though.  It completely fell apart with that last paragraph.
---
How did attempt 8 go, OP? We're all rooting for you here.
---
The issue I have with stuff like this (and to be clear, people can play the game and stuff like this isn’t malicious... usually).
---
But the game is balanced around survivors not being able to communicate.  The number of perks that exist purely to try to gain information indicates this.  I always feel back for a killer like this who gets dunked on because of an external benefit the game is not balanced around.
---
when playing
---
Survivor :  i get a rush out of a close escape
---
Killler : when i kill at least 3 surviviors (rare for me)
---
It's extreme yeah. But my point is that it's easy for other people to judge.
---
Thank you for the explanation
---
Can we agree that Jane is the prettiest?
---
The meg Was also pretty stupid, even if she didn't know how bear traps work she might have asked a few questions when she saw her temmates die in front of her XD
---
He is :)
---
For leatherface I would change his base set to be equivalent to that of the primer bulb and that's it. A simple change that makes his chainsaw less loopable. 
---
For clown I would reduce the cool down between bottle throws and make it so his tonic can animation lock: deny window vaults and pallet drops.
---
I’m always at work *cries in adult*
---
Check my post history, I am not trolling
---
As a survivor main, I’d say bcuz it’s an absolute pain to deal with. Definitely is a time killer and keeps survivors off gens due to self healing or team healing
---
the candy lineup
---
Keep Kindred it's God tier solo.  Get rid of Self Care and replace it with...nothing (a 3 perk survivor is a better teamate than a Self Care Gamer).  Seriously though just replace the Self Care with literally any other perk and your team will do better.
---
Iron Will, Kindred, Spine Chill and Bond/Alert/insert anything here would be good.
---
had the same problem with the endgame collapse one, but this seems worse.
---
Clown should have the reload removed. Make it passive. Every 5s you get a bottle. Make his gas radius bigger.
---
Lf should get a passive where he hooks survivors faster, similar to fire up. He should also lose the acceleration garbage associated with saw. Make him swing as long as you hold the button, making go slower over time due to exhaustion. If he hits a survivor he loses speed. If he hits something or gets stunned, his saw goes on cooldown. Also, remove his infinite saw hold.
---
Trapper needs to spawn with 3 traps. Put trap boxes around the map for him to refill. Only 9 traps can be placed at a time. They will recycle similar to hag.
---
Make huntress 115%. Remove iri heads. 
---
Tbh all killers should be 115%. (My mind will not be changed on this, so don't bother.)
---
Yeah, I think he used overwhelming presence instead of unnerving presence and that's why he didnt get it.
---
Very inspiring lol, I appreciate your response (:
---
You do the shook, YOU GET THE HOOK!
---
IM GOING TO BAN YOU ALL TO HELL
---
I bought Spirit. Hearing into my 1st game rn. Wish me luck!
---
In addition to what u/subbeero said, yeah she's an M1 killer, but she's an M1 killer that only has to hit someone once. It's kinda like playing with noed the whole game.
---
Me and the gang when we find a baby trapper
---
The memes.
---
padded jaws injure survivors lol
---
Dude seriously.  Stop it.  Once the cats out of the bag there's no stuffing it back in.  They'll be other sub members.  Just try it on someone else you've already taken it as far as it can go with me.

---
I really want this as a cosmetic.
---
The fuck?
---
Running the killer long enough for everyone to get safe saves, work generators, open the exit gate, etc.  
---
Nothing quite like getting that dead hard distance to the next pallet loop or window to extend the chase for another few minutes
---
I leveled up the bloodweb once and I got monstrous shrine. Ffs.
---
I'm a rank 5 killer and I find a game instantly. I'm also a rank 8 survivor and it takes like 5-10 minutes
---
HOW THE HELL DO I FORCE SOMEONE TO GET HOOKED DURING ENDGAME SO I CAN DO THE FUCKIN RIFT?
---
PLAY FOR SEVERAL HOURS AND IT DON'T FUCKING HAPPEN.
---
YOU SHOULDN'T BE LIMITED TO WORKING ON ONE OF THESE AT A GODDAMNED TIME. DOING THIS SHIT SOLO IS BULLLLLLSHIIIIT.
---
I mean a lot of other killers can ignore mechanics too, and they don't require a couple hundred hours of building muscle memory or a shitload of downtime
---
Hillbilly can casually walk up to you and one-shot, loops avoided. Hag can build an autism nest and smack you twice if they try to approach a window or pallet, loops avoided. 
---
And I mean the only reason she was ever good was the gigga-lunge and the fact everyone would just dc after being hit because they didn't want to learn how to juke nurse.
---
I mostly play survivor, and I LOVE being chased. I'm laughing the whole time a killer is after me, regardless of if I'm winning or losing the chase. Even when I get downed, I have a huge smile on my face.
---
The other thing that makes me really happy when playing is a last minute save. I don't care if I die going for the save, I don't care if I die after the unhook and the other person escapes. The rush of going back in for someone is one of the reasons I load the game up every day.
---
how about a week ban
---
It's the same res that i play csgo on as well so i like the ratio personally.
---
The Entity sees all. Might as well make it as awkward as possible for ‘em.
---
All the content that is practically monetized? Or servers that are wonky and half the platforms don't have?
---
Other than that, they added an add-on forbath key and added a status effect. The rest just seems to be fixing issues that they created in the first place (reworking Freddy/Bedham, Spirit/Nurse, Halloween Event, etc).
---
You’re making it easy lmao
---
If someone cosplaying a killer approaches you, run at the speed of light.
---
This may cause exhaustion.
---
Killer queue time is pretty instant. Killers being able to turn off SWF wouldn’t add to Killer time, it’d just make SWF queue time impossibly long because all the killers would be on No-SWF queues.
---
I love the lore behind the characters, and I enjoy getting better over time. Even though other people can really try to make the game not fun, I enjoy completing quests and dailies. Killing or escaping shouldn’t be the only focus. It makes people too sweaty.
---
Wiggle points are insignificant next to hatch escape points. Even if 9 out of 10 killers hook you, the one that let you escape gives you way more BP than 10 wiggles will. In my experience, not wiggling as last alive is very much worth it.
---
Eww
---
....no they don't
---
IT SUCKS A FAT COCK BUT NOBODY CAN TELL HOW NEW YOU ARE UNTIL IT'S OVER.   SHOULD BE AN OFFICIAL SUCK MY DICK EMOTE FOR THOSE DOUCHES.
---
I think the easiest way to do this is to use agitation and iron grasp, ruin and monitor and abuse. Trapper sack and the honing stone. Then straight away trap ruin and then go straight for survivors. Down one and then carry them to the basement and trap the hell out of it. A trap in front of the window, on the stairs, on both entrances etc..
---
Then run to the edge of your terror radius ( now 24m) and go back to the basement. If someone doesn't step on your trap but do go for the rescue then you can probably herd them into a trap. 
---
At the end I would then let the last guy go and kind of blackmail him into stepping on traps.
---
I did it this way for the level 3 challenge but I've yet to do level 4
---
These padded jaws are meant to restrain, not to wound.
---
Bear Traps do not inflict damage to trapped victims
---
Ikr nerf clown
---
Just play devour hope 1 and survivor wont try hard until it's too late.
---
Rather than buy new hardware, consider whether you don't mind playing the game in low graphics quality and/or in a lower resolution. Not like the game is real eye candy anyway.
---
If you want to make the game run better, I could help.
---
Or run darkened traps with purple bag and place them at choke points around the map. Seemingly random spots catch people. Pallets catch people. Gens, hooks, and obvious doorways do not.
---
So there should be consequences for using a feature put into the game intentionally, even when used the way it was intended? Wow
---
She looks like she just played against clever/toxic loopers, flashlighters and everyone escaped
---
FUCK YOURSELF MOUSEMONGUS SQUEEKY BITCHING. HIT CAPS LOCK AND LEAVE IT DURR
---
It is well made and fair.
---
Don’t blame BHVR because some horrible people did a horrible thing to purposely spite you.
---
Fair enough then. Then let's say for the person who won't camp as LF, why play him over Billy?
---
No they don't. I use them to show survivors that I just want them to step in my traps. It works pretty well most of the time.
---
Yeah but you dont have to look at a flash light. Look away or face a wall when picking someone up.
---
The counter to screaming every 30 seconds against the Doctor is get in a locker
---
With how poorly the Halloween event went down this doesn't surprise me. Don't understand why it's so difficult for them, but apparently it is. And yeah, their timing of the double BPs is weird too. I'm guessing they wanted to stagger it with the release of tome IV to boost the number of people logging in to play.
---
Definitely pop on to YouTube and watch some killer vids from the leading streamers to see about mindgaming and clunterplaying different tiles.  Mindgames are key you will get rekt mindlessly following the loop.  
---
Also treat every chase with a first time survivor in your game as a test.  See how they do with you at your first loop when you find them.  If they run it weak and you know you can down efficiently stay on them.  If they run it to perfection and you can tell this dude is a good runner just force that particular pallet down, break it, and immediately end chase to go pressure your gens.  Sometimes in a chase all you have to do is get them to burn the pallet.  Tunneling long chases is the easiest way to lose games playing killer.  
---
Identify what loops aren't worth your time.  If I'm chasing a survivor I've identified as being good and they take the chase to say the Crotus Asylum main building NO THANKS I'm fucking outtie lol.  I'm not even following for a thrown pallet in that shitshow.  There are loops you flat out shouldn't even mess with until you're in a scenario where you have to pursue them like maybe someone's dead and another's hooked than sure now might be a good time to commit at this point.  Basically abandoning chase is very smart strategy and shouldn't be seen as a pride thing.  The killers that overcommit to chases enjoy 4 minute games.
---
Killer specifically Freddy is amazing at shutting down loops.  Just base kit Snare Freddy is all you need.  When they take you to a pallet loop you just place your dream snare on the side most opposite of the pallet on the edge of the loop path then chase them through it.  The slowdown forces them to eat a hit or immediately waste the pallet.  Both scenarios are pretty good either way.
---
Spirit once you have that hit on them because insanely easy to end chases with.  If they're injured without Iron Will there is effectively no way to lose them.  Just phase in the direction of their most recent scratches and let your ears take over from there, just follow the whimpering and you'll end phase successfully right behind them and 90% of the time.  
---
Trapper is also great since his traps can deny those loops from being used entirely.  The drawbacks with him though are you need map knowledge and setup time to shut those down and unlike the other 2 killers I named swf can take his power away by following and disarming traps.  He's still worth a mention though.  Shutting down God loops and his snowball potential is really nice.
---
I've seen people give you the Spirit Fury/Enduring advice.  I'd be wary of going that route.  It's a band aid solution for a permanent problem.  Those perks promote mindless playstyles of derping into pallets with no thought or strategy involved.  This isn't healthy for your development or the game in general imo.  It's kind of like telling someone who can't get kills to just run NOED.  Sure it might help get another kill but it won't make you a better player.  Also there are plenty of killers you flat out wouldn't run those perks on like and of the primarily M2 Killers like Hag, Spirit, etc...
---
Probably the hardest one there is. You better hope your teammates only finish 1 gen without you. Any more and you're screwed.
---
So if you get found, the right choice is to just get downed immediately or your team will do gens while you are chased. Or sandbag your teammates by leading the killer to them on a gen. Really great challenge they designed here
---
I now feel motivated to download the dbd rip off on the android store "Dead Before Daylight"
---
Doc has some really cool add ons as well, too bad the devs made his base kit trash to compensate
---
A few weeks ago I waited over an hour to actually play a killer match. Two matches ended immediately due to survivor disconnects while loading and when I finally got to play the third match the survivors were all way above my skill level and toxic about it in end game chat. Is it even worth gloating about beating a rank 20 killer with 3 low level perks when you are higher ranked and running 4 max level perks and carrying strong items? :(
---
Smeg
---
I thought Laurie was taller!
---
i did mine with Hag rusted shackle and Agitation, Iron Grasp, Monstrous Shrine, and NOED (didn't even need the NOED). It only took me three tries, and I got super close on the times I didn't succeed. If you commit, it's not that difficult
---
Literally personal preference, I see what your going for and yes I’m aware LF can down literally everyone with his chainsaw but that his ability and I don’t think just because you dislike a certain playstyle it should be removed or changed. I’m not sure what rank survivor/killer you are but whenever people that shit in red ranks they end up with one or two kills unless your doing SWF and the others do something dumb.
---
What can you do against a basement trapper? What’s the best strat? I can’t really play LF well but as a basement trapper my mission fails if I get one person in the basement and all the gens complete... take advantage of the time the killer wastes.
---
Also I notice your downvoting my comments the second they go down which leads me to believe you don’t actually care about what I say so this will most likely be my last message unless you have something specific you want to say.
---
Boo hoo...
---
One word, Mori!
---
Ah, I see.
---
The game is more-so GPU-intensive, especially given high resolutions and high/ultra graphics settings, but the gameplay code is also pretty inefficient and asks more than it has any right to from the CPU. The devs have actually said they want to rewrite base code to make it more efficient, but that was months ago and they've since gone all but silent on optimization.
---
Either way, the GPU is more important. I have pretty dated components and I can still get the game up into the 100fps range (and up to 300-400 in the tutorial, for reference) if I apply some tweaks that reduce the GPU load - which means that even older processors are able to run the game fairly well.
---
What if I told you challenges are supposed to be a challenge?
---
He has ascended
---
That's incorrect. Other console multiplayer games have blocked the ability to join multiplayer modes if the player is in a party.
---
i dunno, from my experience, almost all of them are pretty decent. we just get stuck with low rank survivors and it makes the game unbalanced as fuck and suddenly everyone's in the basement lol
---
I feel personally attacked, because i'm a meg main and all i did yesterday was item hunting with Plunderer's and Ace in the hole.
---
This is why I've stopped being nice.
---
In my opinion he doesn't, not with nemesis and play with your food. If they change the way that nemesis and play with your food work then yes. I can do ok with leather face against red ranks with the primer bulb. If you really wanted to buff him then perhaps give him more map presence somehow. 
---
The clown in my opinion is very weak against good survivors and they will just drop the pallet early. I don't think they would need to make his tonic animation lock but at the bare minimum;  decrease cool down between throws and decrease reload speed. The direct throws create an animation lock could help but he really needs to either have greater lethality to compensate for his severe lack of map presence or he needs a better balance of both. Perhaps give him his own set of bottles that boost his speed when drunk but the effect is cancelled when he throws a tonic bottle
---
i just started getting into spirit and shes been soooo fun to play as, even at a low level with low level perks. if you put a shit ton of bp into her im sure shed be a blast to play as.
---
Almost finished it last night first try. Playing Freddy I popped 3/4 gens. Was last survivor left with about five seconds left on last gen when he closes hatch. I was in a SWF group that saved one gen for me, my first two I popped solo.
---
I was watching a youtube video after being put on a hook and I wasn’t prepared for the survivor to unhook me. The oni came rushing towards us and I tried to get my fingers into position to get away.  I started to get way and I went to press shift and I started crouching. I kept pressing it making be tbag until he downed me. I then realized my thumb was on ctrl instead of shift
---
Sorry, maybe it's me but I don't see any common point except for the hair color.
---
I HATE PLAYING TRAPPER IT'S SO STRESSFUL BUT IT'S MY FAVORITE FUCKING KILLER
---
Hmmm, I see. 
---
I will try to moonwalk more often then and hope I end up on the other side since I use enduring pretty often.
---
To each his own. I will happily trade those few meaningless points for a chance of escape. If it doesn´t pan out, I don´t miss those few points, you should work for the rest of the game to get proper points anyway. 
---
You wanna die for a few points, that is your choice.
---
That's pretty spot on I love it! Even without my weakness for redheads
---
Wraith is just so done with this
---
Playing with friends!
---
Reported for tunneling
---
*Edit* You guys would not believe the luck I just had. Bond and Prove Thyself helped me get it! Thank goodness that’s over.
---
I mean David's head is on a women's body ffs! :D
---
You burn the offering then okay as the killer you loaded in as that’s how it’s supposed to work. Then the killer becomes available in your killer selection after the game. You can play the new killer an unlimited amount of times until you select a new killer or switch to survivor then the killer becomes unavailable again. 
---
Example: pick pig and burn the nightmare offering. You still play as pig for that trial.
---
Hairless Jeff is scary
---
I have no issue with the quality of your photo editing skills
---
UNDERRATED COMMENT TBH
---
I’ve had around 400, play at mostly red ranks and have encountered tons of them,
---
Wow, that is incredibly helpful information, thank you very very much, I will absolutely consider this.
---
awful
---
Nah, as soon as they wiggle they are going on the hook. 
---
Giving hatch is going out of your way to *lose* points. I will happily do it if the game was fun and the survivor doesn´t wiggle, but if he is going out of his way to get those few wiggle points and trying to win a battle he knows he lost, he is out.
---
I can't stand him though
---
Exactly. Especially when they actively ignore generators right next to them and let team mates die on the hook to complete their challenge
---
There's a couple I saw Otzdarva do, one of them was right at the top of the basement stairs but a little to the right and they kept falling for it. Honestly even though it seems obvious I would have probably stood on it because you wouldn't see it til it's too late. 
---
There's a few sneaky ones on the yamoka estate around the house where the oni mask is too
---
This is why. My goal as a killer is not only to just kill, but to keep those survivors off the gens as much as possible. If a survivor is healing themselves, that's one less survivor on a gen, and if they're being healed by someone else, and then taking turns healing, it's a few extra seconds I can keep them off the gen.
---
you will distract them what ?
---
Why nerf the hard counter to Ruin though?
---
The drop from the generator in the Asylum.
---
I had a Steve run up the stairs in front of me, and slam a pallet in my face at the top. He then blinded me with a flashlight. I broke the pallet and hear SNAP. He fell down the hole next to the gen right in to my trap. He dc'ed shortly after I hooked him.
---
I don't think there was ever a cap. WMI alone is 8 seconds while WMI + Botany is 6.87 seconds so you probably just didn't notice the difference.
---
I was a survivor main for a long time
---
I surely wouldn't call that egocentrism, He sounds like he is being an asshole, sure, the game gives you so many signs that somebody is hooked in an area. But maybe the above commenter isn't being 100% honest either.
---
Get the killer to chase him, then dead hard into a wall and die most likely
---
What are you talking about lol. There was an entirely separate chart published measuring killer killrate and userate in red ranks alone. Ergo there ARE red rank statistics for Nurse and they are barely better than Clown and Demogorgon.
---
And everything is based on skill of the player. But I bet you didn’t think that when Nurse was still a good killer. I bet the stats meant **everything** back then
---
Hes gonna ask for personal details that honestly don't matter in an interview. Name, country, bday, etc. 
---
I went ahead and bit the bullet. Personally, feel like this is a scam. Also, paid for writing about dbd? Why tf would you ask reddit?
---
Drinking anesthesia to boost power? Lmao that's ridiculous and I love it.
---
Yeah, but you should try to make a break for somewhere else asap.
---
no it was WMI + BOTA + MEDKIT. 1,5 or 2 seconds is still noticeable when you are healing under pressure.
---
But that was back then for the bubba release if i remember.
---
I mean, it's kind of his career to do that...
---
Uhhhh no sorry. I understand what you are saying but using her blinks at the right moment comes with experience. Also you shouldn’t be using both blinks to travel only use one. a good nurse will blink on top of a survivor and get the first hit. The survivor will get some distance but not enough to out pace her. One blink will recharge in the time it takes for fatigue to end then you blink for distance back to the survivor and then lethal blink and then you got them. Nurse is all about patients and understanding her pace, timing, and blink distance. Nurse is still incredible imo.
---
There have to be 4 survivors and 1 killer in each game, but sure, it's not that easy. But I think it is also not too far away from this. In my old Xbox group, I was the Killer Main, then there were 3 people who play both and 5 people who play survivor. 
---
When I switched to PS4 because of more people and RL friends (still I love Xbox), I'm now playing 60% survivor and 40% Killer, but nearly everyone I know is survivor main :/
---
I think about 10-20% are more killer mains, 30-50% are survivor mains and 30-50% play both sides (nearly) equally.. But that are just random thoughts.
---
when i have a rly intense match where the killer was rly good and despite going for the 4k they give me hatch. 
---
also when i get a message from the killer and theyre like, wanna farm? 
---
OH and like when ghostface or michael are the killers bc i always have fun in those games bc they make me happy :3c
---
i like the lore and cosmetics too! fanart is a plus as well
---
cheers for the detailed rundown :)
---
You're setting up a 3 gen loss though by doing what you're doing.  OP is right.  We all need to identify what gens should be prioritized and which ones should be ignored for late game.  When you start the game the first gen you do should be the most unsafe one in the middle of nowhere with no protective loops around it or right in the middle of the map.  Get the problem gens done first.  Giving a competent killer a 3 gen is a consistent way to blow games for your team.
---
When you least expect it. When you're chasing that Claudette who's been BMing you all game. ***LOUD EXPLOSION NOISE.***
---
You can find Reddit posts before Bubba’s release that say WMI stacks with other perks
---
About vanishing after a fire, I have fire ptsd, is fire mentioned in the lore? Or is that something you interpreted? Ty.
---
Hag sucks for basement games? Not even close
---
No, that was the Demogorgon, not Clown.
---
I APPRECIATE THE HUG
---
You will be asleep during a chase after the 1st hit though.
---
I rather have a survivor try to make me feel bad with useless teabagging or words than have a toxic killer actually ruin the game by using unfun mechanics.
---
Because of this I changed the language on ps4 a loooong time ago to English.
---
honestly they need to fix this tbh
---
Wait marki boy is playing
---
and other post that say it does not stack
---
No dude I'm literally saying that a survivor can outpace her. Statistically.
---
I was curious about percentage on reddit than in game, but thanks :)
---
HADDONFIELD IS A LOT BIGGER THAN YOU THINK WHEN YOU REALIZE HOW FAR THE BASEMENT IS. HOWEVER I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HERE. JUST RUN IRON/AGITATION AND IT'LL PROBABLY WORK OUT. I PERSONALLY LOVE DOING BASEMENT TRAPPER BUT THAT'S ME.
---
them killers ?
---
Please say sike right now.
---
I always let Dwight's escape. I cant allow myself to hurt them .
---
Might mean farming as in doing an unsafe unhook
---
Nurse IS still a good killer in fact she’s the best killer still because SHE GOES THROUGH everything she will always be the best killer if the player is good at her red rank killers do not = good
---
Haha these are worthless. gif
---
Sounds like your mate needs to pay more attention to the symbols on the right.
---
This is one of those scenarios where you are 1000% right and trying to tell survivors how to play more optimally and better help their team but it won't matter that you're right and you'll still get downvoted into oblivion by mediocre players that don't understand the concept of repairing a "bad" generator.  These are the kinds of players that hand Docs 3 gens without any effort.
---
Then get really close when they open the gates to scare them as they leave
---
It's like they think clicking the flashlight will make me change my mind. It won't, it's further proof that I *shouldn't* chase them
---
When Nancy can't stand being near Steve
---
I have nothing to grind for when there are no events. I feel hallow and empty inside. Where are my party starters? Those things that people drop thinking theyre good and then dont even get a blind but blind me. Im gonna miss that. Yeah the Oni is cool and all so is the map but it just doesnt feel right if I cant mori someone under Christmas lights or Tbag at the exit gate merrily. Theres no christmas spirit anymore and I dont like it. Thats why im deciding to run for President of Behavior! Vote for me 2020 Make DBD great again!
---
Sometimes killers will just wait those 15 seconds aswell.
---
That doesn’t mean anything lol. She is still the slowest killer in the game and the basekit nerf gives you 6 seconds of immunity to her even if she hits you with a blink attack.
---
The hitting sound had me fucking dead
---
Imagine not dragging moried survivors back into your basement and making them into your famous chilli smh
---
Yeah apparently they don't appear for them haha.
---
Yes. u/Nova_dark- made a post. I indulged and immediately figured it was a scam. I notified mods.
---
yes. I did. and im trying to make a joke
---
Wait i thought they pay our all the infinite loops.
---
Awesome
---
Yes when Dwight says " so how are we gonna beat this guy" David says " I'll distract them" referring to the killer.  
---
Either him/them would be fine
---
What do you mean by unfun mechanics?
---
I play both sides. Dwight, Nea, Meg, Jake, Adam, David, The Pig, The Legion, The Clown, The Plague, The Huntress, The Demogorgon
---
I wouldn't say I'm particularly casual or competitive. I'm in the middle; sometimes I play to win and sometimes I play freely.
---
I'd definitely say I'm a creative player. DbD isn't known as being a creative game but I really combining cosmetics and perks to build fully developed and interesting characters
---
removed feel free to send us mods a modmail and we will review this
---
why them is correct in this context ?
---
People only said “don’t stack” because they misinterpreted the 100%, like how people still do now. Other posts confirmed that people successfully stacked them in tests. There’s never been a cap. Changing something big like that would have been a very important patch note.
---
He wanted me to sign into a google drive acct to sign an NDA or something and contact his editor?  
---
I didn't bite though.
---
Lol sounds about right
---
The doorways to the preschool.  The one closest to the picket fence vault is awesome because you can hide half of the trap in the doorframe.
---
He didn't feel like taking your DS.
---
No it's to mimic the joke that flew past his head
---
Am I right in guessing English is your second language? If so then you speak it very well :)
---
Honestly I should have had Dwight say " How are we going to beat this killer" and then "them" would have fitted better but it just has less of a ring to it.
---
Wasn't it the same for pewdiepie?
---
Seems felix grew up but this fake face didn't.
---
&gt; You start off responding to something that doesn't even exist
---
Ok, and what is that?
---
&gt; Yes, I called entitled survivor mains bitches because they want to BM as much as they can, but will cry, like bitches, when it happens to them. Is that me being a dick for no reason or generalizing?
---
Yes, it is. First off, this doesn't really have any direct relation to what OP posted, as lots of the stuff you said before. Also you've started with describing "survivors", which only now transformed into "entitled survivor mains". But yet again as it doesn't directly relate to the OP's post, you just did a random rant here, because literally the same thing can be said about "entitled killer mains" - which actually is kinda more related to the video above.
---
But.
---
If somebody started generalizing killer side the same way you did I would have the same response, because if person is being jerk it yet again doesn't matter which side they play, they will be still entitled.
---
&gt; You assume because I get multiple downvotes that somehow that's an indication of being objectively right or wrong, rather than pluralism, which I completely expect after triggering someone and their cognitive dissonance.
---
Actually it's the opposite. I thought the same I do now even before you had any downvotes. I wouldn't even bring up the votes into any discussion in the first place - it's you who started talking about it. 
---
Which I responded by saying that I don't find your downvotes surprising considering how you speak and what.
---
&gt; But hey, you keep on crusading and deluding yourself, if that's what makes you feel good about yourself.
---
Which crusade actually? It actually looks more as your crusade against *survivors* and *buttmads*. I feel myself more of a bad right now for including myself into this discussion because it was kinda obvious how much shit there gonna be bursting. 
---
From a person who talks about "entitlement" and "double standards" btw. 
---
Oh well.
---
I play both but prefer killer and play killer more.
---
You couldn't be more right. Hell they're discontinuing events in favor of more rift nonsense so they don't even have to be creative anymore. I'm really hoping the upcoming asymmetrical games give DBD some real competition. They're getting pretty complacent.
---
This isn't another multiplayer game. We're typing about dbd. Swf grps on console join party chat to communicate with each other. I would know, I play dbd on console after all.
---
I love this one, as well as the one in The Game's drop (tho that one is kinda tricky to place)
---
As a person who uses logic and common sense to process someone's perspective through how they express their opinion about something, I disagree with that statement
---
Not only that but survivors constantly complain about tunneling. Now we're supposed to tunnel to allow BT plays
---
Potato patato.
---
IT WAS STILL INKY A 4K FOR A WHILE BUT THEY CHANGED IT I THINK AROUND PLAGUE TO MEAN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DOUBLE PIP AND NOT JUST 4K
---
What?
---
I love these comments keep them coming!
---
You're a grade A jackass. Well done.
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Hmmm no i'm pretty sure that was a confirmed thing to the point that i completely stop using this combinaison of perks as i said.
---
Anyway i think it's a god think we are now able to really make a use of all those tools together even if at the ends… it's just to win 1,5s.
---
You look a bit too realistic
---
I love the mood and atmosphere.... sneaking carefully through the fog, hearing an ominous warning of who the Killer is (a shriek, a scream, a roar)... then suddenly hearing the terror radius, seeing the red stain and running for your life on adrenaline!
---
I love the creativity of the characters. Especially the early characters were so deep and unique and really stood out as realistic sorts of people from all walks of life. I love seeing how each survivor and killer really take on different personalities, tones and styles
---
Anddd I love the teamwork. I truly love working together and helping out my teammates and keeping them alive. The feeling you get of a gut instinct where you and the other survivor see each other and just *know* what each of you have to do. I love the trust, and I even love the back-and-forth between Killers and Survivors as they get to "know" each other in chase
---
Clerics in a nutshell
---
Lol wtf. Someone asked me to join a discord for an interview but sounded very dodgy
---
Its impossible to say anything without someone getting mad on this subreddit. It's a matter of learning to ignore it. We are an opinionated community
---
We didn't even get party starters! They could literally do exactly what they did last year with no changes and I'd be happy. How hard is it to change the music and add some pretty lights?
---
I would comfortably say 90% I play survivor, mostly swf. 10% killer, mostly if no one is on, I feel like doing a daily or I have rift challenges to do. I play quite a bit. Don't know hours(console) but have been playing since August 2018 and am currently devotion 9.
---
In dead by daylight it does. This is also the same world where people can wall off being impaled on a meat hook. 
---
So chill.
---
sacrificed by pull ups
---
then where is it?
---
Probably going through the wall from the top floor inside.
---
just finish the gens and move on to the next match.
---
Right in the feels haha. I had that happen to me. Except he dropped me kinda close to the hatch. As I was slithering over to it he slammed it shut. Picked me up and took me to a door only to shake his head it at and instead hook me. 
---
It was awesome! /s
---
I don't understand. Why would a killer get a headache if he chose to play against a swf group? You implying he wants the headache? Whatever strokes their boat I guess.
---
He also got killed by farmers.
---
Kill yourself on first hook is the only counter to this zero skill needed killer.
---
Little versions of the current survivors is money I'd throw at the devs.
---
Look what's happening now. At higher ranks q time rises. Only to finally join a match and a killer thinking I'm in a swf group leaves the match, and I have to re q all over again.
---
Oof. This is my life in solo queue every time I'd go for a late unhook with a camping killer. Sometimes I just dead hard through them and force them to take the hit.
---
I'm trying to help you, just take a fucking hit!
---
Does Markiplier play dbd?
---
#she will never touch your peepee
---
They hated him because he told them the truth
---
Don't let this city become the next Riften. We have enough thieve ridden cities.
---
They should honestly just display the loss of points when you do an unsafe unhook. You lose points more points than you gain if they get hit before you're granted the safe unhook points, I think.
---
It's just not displayed for some reason
---
Welcome to reedit. Where everyone's upset about absolutely stupid shit. Lmao
---
No, it was pretty bad then, too.
---
Stabby gang!
---
Fixed my comment stupid auto correct.
---
It only blocks the instantaneous down, and not the actual hit. So if the survivor is injured, they're still going down. And even then, like OP said, it doesn't block chainsaws or Oni's power, so getting hit by those is business as usual.
---
How can you not know they're hooked? Big red aura shows them hanging on a hook unless you get third sealed.
---
So do the gens???? That's an easy win
---
What it the picture from
---
I hate that shit. I'm not asking you to run to each gen but god damned its not rocket science if the killer is busy do a gen, if you don't see the killer, do a gen.
---
Ok, but I agree on what you say, as long as the camping is justified in a way. But tunneling to me, even as a killer, isn't justified. When I accidentally do it while trying to follow scratch marks, it's dumb but I just go along.
---
I would too, but the problem is getting all 4 people to go along with it. Since it has to be 4, it makes it a bit challenging :(
---
I mean are they even looping if you're not trying to catch them?

Fire is how she got away with her crimes because the walls of the law were closing in on her so she killed her kids and set a fire with her as the lady who was found in the house or a person she killed to put in the fire
---
Legion cosmetics come as body, mask, and weapon, instead of top, bottom, weapon so you will receive the whole outfit
---
Yeah he even let us farm first so we wouldn't de pip. Hopefully the next group of survivors let him do it or he accomplishes it on his own
---
Yeah, the fake reactions like other YouTubers he's copying is really annoying.
---
That said he seems like a nice guy, at least.
---
Get downvotes.
---
The shirt and pants are one piece on the legion
---
There's a lot of strong loops left that you can't mind game,  and you're better off just abandoning the chase.
---
awwww ur no fun  
---
 👁️👅👁️
---
!megHead
---
The devs had a plan for the perk the whole time, the mad lads
---
Imo they both have different target audiences, 
---
Pewdiepie atrracts the attention of popular games and memes (and sometimes news).
---
Markiplier targets the gaming community in general and highlights horror games while also showcaseing indie games (I wish he played a wider expansion of them though)
---
I don't really watch them all that much, but this is what I generally got from the two.
---
i do homework or browse twitter 😗
---
Ghostface and Michael are really fun. Leatherface is good if you don't have bbq and chili yet. I also like the demogorgon
---
Damn son what you did to Meg is criminal, the more you look at her the more disturbing it is.
---
Thx I’ll think which of them I’ll pic 😄
---
Killer only. I don't really find survivor fun.
---
I'd finish the gens and move on, if I wasn't dead
---
They never planned one in the first place.
---
I did it, but it wasan't a fun match.
---
I did a similar thing with a MoriMeDaddy lol to my surprise, they were upset after I mori’d them 😂
---
Honestly, the obvious ones get them the most of the time, especially Pallet traps. Also, Trapping downstairs works fine, it's way darker and Survivors tend to gravitate toward doing gens down there first.
---
I want to hit you with a chainsaw and put you on a hook.
---
I have a long pvc pipe and I yell rude things at people as they walk by. They think it’s my neighbor because of the pipe and I bounce the sound off their wall. Greatest shit ever.
---
CHOO-CHOO, motherfuxker
---
I expect the title theme of Thomas to be played when chased by the killer.
---
But they aren't infinites right?
---
I play mostly survivor and some killer🤷🏼‍♀️ I try to get the best of both worlds.
---
Wiggle points or hatch points, choice is yours
---
The joker movie
---
Enduring + spirit fury + shadow dance.
---
There ya go👍
---
Nice! Yeah when I did it I hooked 3 in the basement, finally got the last one after a chase where she wiggled out, and as soon as I hooked her in the basement she DC’d and didn’t start the sacrifice animation. I was a bit worried for a moment but it gave it to me anyway as well.
---
You should try looking more like u just got out of kindergarten and can’t find ur moms car
---
I’m a survivor main and usually only play killer if I absolutely have to for dailies, but the learning curve and potential for playing nurse is an appealing challenge. Thank you for this inspiring post I may just start trying her out tonight :)

[I think "Pyrrhic victory" applies here ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory?wprov=sfla1)
---
Yah the dev yesterday said on stream that it was a glitch as to why we could see that. I think they are full of shit and also stated they removed it so people wouldn’t dodge lobbies and even made the example of a rank 8 survivor getting paired with a bunch of rank 17’s and therefore would dodge the lobby and that’s why they removed it.
---
My opinion is this, 
---
If your shitty match making program that’s always broken and you know it’s broken, “Actually worked” like it was intended, then we wouldn’t even have to dodge the lobby because we would be paired with people at least close to are ranks and not get dicked over in game with a bunch of noobs! 
---
But this is BhVR Interactive who is run by a bunch of incompetent devs...
---
They said on their Q&amp;A it’s not though
---
maybe ur just not good then, no shame in that
---
#  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
People who enjoy playing a game, and are at peace with the fact that they're not the best player in the world, and will get outplayed quite frequently, and are.... ok with that?
---
Reddit, play games on my phone or Netflix
---
Sounds like a YOU problem.
---
Why would the developers give them a misleading name like that?
---
I'm thinking about farming this one :v
---
But you still have to side with me, it's stupid
---
Infinite loading screen still happens 2-3 times a week for me on PS4
---
/r/okbuddyretard
---
Almost every game I play the killer comes back to the hook after an unhook, there is almost no time to fuck around. If he's busy then lets heal under the hook but if no one else is being chased he's coming right back.
---
You're just being maincist.
---
man i BARELY get farming games so when i do i kinda appreciate it from getting my ass wrecked all the time lol but that’s just me
---
I thought within 5 ranks was deemed acceptable at one point?
---
Also, the developers have stated they are looking in to matchmaking. Since it's the holiday season, a fix won't be coming until sometime in the new year.
---
Entity blockers don't always work. I had a Dwight run through the cow fence maze building window 6 times before i had to just leave.
---
Our toxic community does not deserve Otz. Hes too good for us.
---
Reported for damaging their ego.
---
Ngl, it looks kinda traced. If it isn't though, Good job on it OP
---
Not on ps4, people on ps4 are fucking toxic assholes
---
Its because it only applies during a chase and since its such a long loop you can sometimes lose the chase which would make it not count towards the entity blocker.
---
Not all killers - just some of them. I never dodge survivors even if I know the names and suspect that those guys gonna whoop my ass. And I think it's a real minority of those who will dodge 2man SWF.
---
And again those who dodge 3 or 4 lobbies yet again will dodge it regardless - but BP bonus might actually make them reconsider, at least I hope so.
---
Also as I already proposed SWF bonus can stack with BBQ maximum up to 100% - which yet again is neat because people who use BBQ mostly for stacks will be able to pick something they like more.
---
As far as I was aware they were referring to matchmaking wait times and not the ranking disparities. 
---
They haven’t issued an update on the intended rank difference since the last one which stipulated there could be up to a 6 rank difference.
---
As a rank 9 survivor I was getting full lobbies of 20s yesterday and as a rank 12 killer getting reds and purples. The week after the rank reset is worst but then it evens out once everyone plays for a while. I need to get to reds so I don't reset so far...
---
Entitled survivors need to learn how to chill out
---
Those lives belong to daddy entity.
---
Isn’t there a delay the streamer can turn on so they don’t get sniped? I’m not on twitch much and don’t know much about it. Heard a few things in the past from people saying this
---
I prefer the X2BP though. Why do you want events when you know you're just gonna get hook/gen reskins anyway?
---
Hag with Rusty Shackles, Agitation, Mad Grit, Save the Best for Last and Make Your Choice.
---
This isn't the fault of match making this is the fault of wait times caused by the ease of survivor ranking and difficulty of killer ranking.
---
i did this one, but played like an asshole ;-;
---
Community: rank doesn't matter 
---
Behvr: breaks matching due to removal of unintended bug allowing survivors to see each other's rank
---
Community: fix your shit
---
Behvr: were currently working on improving quality of life for Solo que vs swf que'
---
Community: nice road map bruh
---
Behvr: bann 🔨 in twitch
---
This is working as intended. It is +-6 ranks from your current rank, while it is not ideal and should be tuned down, it is working as intended and saying they need to "fix" the matchmaker is largely comical and misplaced.
---
Criticism is fine, but it must be correct criticism. This right here, is not. 
---
"The gap for playing games being +-6 ranks is too much disparity between ranks (especially for lower ranked killers and high ranked Survivors) and that is precisely why so many games are as bad as they currently are. It is never good to be a Rank 7 Survivor and have the chance to face a Rank 1 Killer in which I have no chance, while I completely stomp and run around a poor Rank 13 Killer. This disparity does not make sense, please alleviate or at least, consider alleviating the ranked matching width to about 3-4 ranks."
---
and I don't care about points. I play the game to play the game. if I wanted ot play a farming simulator, I'd get one of those
---
This is true
---
Yea...well...here we are...
---
They are Legion because there are four of them with the same style of hunting in a trial.
---
Should likely add, unkillable only blocks exposed effects, and not the hit. So if you're hit with a chainsaw, for example, you're still going down, since the instadown is built into the chainsaw (and is only removed with speed limiter), ditto with iridescent head, and you're still going down if already injured. It also won't block effects that outright kill you, like Myers's Tombstone.
---
This is true as well, but play a friendly Myers to my victims unless they are toxic evil shitheads
---
I went AFK for a match, all my teammates escaped and I pipped somehow. Go figure.
---
Haha baby killer hit me when I had BT because I bodyblocked. Gotteeeem!
---
Just saying, you don't need to say tbh if you start the statement with honestly. Js.
---
Math is your god
---
Because increasing fun isn't just a number tweak they can easily do. People don't have fun for several reasons, some may dc because they find something un-fun that the majority of people are okay with. Improving small things over time should have the effect of increasing the overall fun

WHY DO PEOPLE SUDDENLY RESPECT PALLETS WHEN I GO FOR THE PALLET STUN CHALLENGE LIKE WHAT
---
The hair should be a bit more orange.
---
Farming as in farming your teammates, performing an unsafe unhook.
---
Trapper add-ons that reset trap and down survivors when they escape from it
---
Trapper daddy build 
---
Map cornfield with basement in the middle or Myers map 
---
I learn people are more accustomed to try to get the hook save when ruin is not on
---
I don't know how much better it would work out for a Trapper (I personally did it with Coxcombed+Ghost Wraith), but try the challenge on Lery's, it won't stop some people from DC'ing like the usual assholes they are, but either basement is pretty nasty for snowballing, especially the one that spawns in the office/study.
---
My wait times are 30 seconds
---
Watch movies on a tablet.
---
Playing the game still wouldn’t be fun for the killer but the extra bloodpoints may seem worth it. I kinda like the idea.
---
Is this the dbd mobile version?
---
Link please?
---
Lol did you see how she climbed up and hooked herself lmfao!
---
It's their wait times vacuuming you into the lobby. If they keep waiting the system keep expanding its search until it find the first available opponent, which happened to be you.
---
I mean it's part of their power lol it's not about dying across the map, it's why do they have both
---
Only 18+ are allowed to play in the fog
---
Link to the video I’m referring to:    https://youtu.be/llox87MyeFI
---
Between no delay to 10 minutes (Rank 5 Killer depends on time of day). Between 5 to 30 minutes (Rank 7-5 Survivor, again, depends on time of day)
---
Probably works better than the DBD mobile app which won’t be out till sometime next year and the Chinese are still ahead of BhVR with their shitty knock offs!
---
During en game collapse camping is perfectly normal.  I say this as a survivor player.  It's reality stop thinking killers have to always follow some moral code.  There's no reason to not camp during the end-game collapse.
---
Killers already easily get more blood points. I get what you're saying though.  Maybe a different approach like you can tell pre lobby if they're a group or not. That way you can decide if you want to stick around or change your build
---
The risk vs reward is nice
---
He violated the law...he had to serve his sentence, his goods were forfeited and he had to pay with his life.
---
I wouldn't mind playing against de-pip squads if I got double bloodpoints everytime and confirmation that they were in fact a de-pip squad dispite what they say in endgame chat.
---
Imagine needing mobility to win, pffftt..
---
TunnelFace!
---
I don't like this. Extra BP is pity points, a band-aid, for an issue that wouldn't get fixed with it.
---
When you cant beliv you git duble pipe.
---
Oh *fuck yes*, whatever cosmetic they give him I'd throw my money at it.
---
Legion is very underwhelming. When they were released thk. Boi it was fun to moonwalk them to death
---
I'd love that too, but it would never get added because then killers would just dodge the lobby every time. I know i would.
---
Lmao she looks like that shrunk down Joker people use for memes
---
legion is good, yes you wont get a 4k every game, but is fun, and u can get good bp, and emblems pretty fast.
---
Its a way to cut the grind and make SWF squads less unbearable. SWF is never gonna be balanced or removed, might as well give us suckers the double BP.
---
I main survivor in red ranks &amp; I'm a green killer when I do play

I mean I love wearing the flashy outfits because I think they look cool. I don’t try to hide at all. I just wish my boy Adam got more love from the devs.

I know we won't get the winter event but are we actually getting another double xp event? I'm not able to check because i'm at work, so I wasnt sure If this was just a meme or an accurate meme.
---
Yeah, that's a "You NEED to talk to a therapist" kinda thing
---
I just literally finished it with Ghostface but do you know thanks for the idea :)
---
Oh yeah and I'm not talking about literally running up to the killer when i talk about them knowing. That is more of a trying to mind game them move. I was talking more about when you just try and run out of the basement or towards a safer loop. When you don't give them a clue you have borrowed time and they still ignore you go for the saver despite them tunneling before.
---
Bruh you a &gt;!bitch!&lt;
---
Ngl
---
Kick them. Kicking a gen causes it to regress over time, it's a fairly important part of playing as the killer.
---
Happy birthday, my dude 🙆🙆🙆

He still uses his chainsaw to down a single survivor 99% of the time :(

unless he facecamps.

Just finished it thank you everyone for the help

Fax
---
remember that swing chains and jump rope addons have been nerfed, i dont like thanato+sloppy on freddy, but thats just my opinion, id go with ruin, pgtw, discordance (so u dont worry about people stackin on gens and also having a reference on where to use pgtw) and some other perk of your choice, dying light is good, but it wont help at all until u get some tokens, surveillance or thrilling tremors are also good, and will help u know where to teleport
---
Double portals around your 3 key generators, and be sure you don't end up stuck in a chase long enough for survivors to destroy two of them at the same time.
---
Alternatively, run a [basement build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-qix4OYfzU).
---
Save the Best for Last is an exceptional perk on Demogorgon - you can use regular attacks on regular survivors, and save your Shred for the Obsession. Other than that, take the same things you'd take on any other killer - slowdown perks, perhaps a lethality perk so that you can quickly put survivors on the back foot.
---
I’m glad he 4k’d them
---
why this game draws so much whininess baffles me
---
Discount myers lol. Not even close my dude.
---
People could totally swing themselves off meat hooks in real life. Bad example. The realm of the Entity is strange, but it still follows basic laws of physics and other such things that adhere to our world. Don’t use the “because video game” excuse.
---
r/Stabbygang

We must stab
---
Survivors tend to be worse, if only through mob mentality
---
Hes honestly not abysmal if you decide not to camp.
---
Don’t tell him guys
---
CAMPING KILLERS PISS ME OFF. IT SHOWS ABSOLUTELY NO GAME SKILL. IF I SEE YOU CAMP TWO HOOKS AND THEN TRY TO HOOK ME I WILL DC. I DON'T DC OUT OF RESPECT GENERALLY BUT FUCK OFF WITH YOUR FACECAMPS.
---
Yeah but some people don't want to hear a story about making out in dbd
---
I just say to myself if he breaks off he does. I can understand wiggling to 99 as insurance but breaking off is a sin I cannot allow
---
Hag for ruin, or clown for pop goes the weasel and bamboozle
---
A momentary and rare drop won't ruin your wait time. If you're dropping every other match you have a problem and you need to not drag other people's games into that problem.
---
Wow, some people are greedy for no good reason. The wiggle points are not even a big deal
---
Nice, shame they got out.  I hate the t bagging flashlight clicking ones but usually they want to just waste your time so I ignore them and let them chase me around and not do any gens. Do you need any tips as killer?
---
How much money have u spent on this game
---
This brings joy to my heart.
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if meg turned on her team and hunted her team especially dwight who lives in lockers and cowars in fear of everything /s
---
No, you have to finish level iv of the archives or you'll miss out
---
The incredible irony being that this sub is exactly what you’re describing
---
And you had a clown mori...which is the best in game
---
Please, i need help, my chases either take too long or end straight away
---
Same. Hope they get banned, but they probably were using smurf accounts
---
So you spend time on the Reddit because?
---
The hag I got it for free
---
People gotta learn this tactic smh
---
I think they need to experiment with height difference a little more. I want a short male survivor and a tall female one
---
I guess it’s because Frank is the “frontman”
---
i think they should just allow chat in game  and alter whatever needs to be altered around the survivor team having comms
---
I have 1,000+ hours in the game and yet to have this Achievement.
---
Any time I’ve tried, someone has ALWAYS d/c’d
---
I honestly find the butt dances or „tbagging” cute they dont bother me at all
---
IS NOT GETTINGN AAVE DAND BEING PUT ON DEATH HOOK PART OF THE GAME. I HAVENT GOT SAVED ONCE THIS ENTIRE WEEK
---
Nemesis, Furtive chase, Pop goes etc, and Ruin. Took me two games because I didn’t kill anyone.  I’m the non killing killer.
---
The 10% of videos where he actually plays a game he isn't pretending to like is pretty good, though.
---
Can you be a gang if there is only one of you?
---
People who are upset about being ‘slugged’ are really ignorant to the game mechanics. Being slugged gives you and your team time to heal you; if you’re hooked it’s the same situation except now your in a new hook phase and time is ticking. No killer would/should slug a whole team and not hook for the whole death timer; that’s stupid on their part and that’s a player issue that *should* be reportable.
---
wow this is sad
---
Yeah I was confused cause Steam sent me elsewhere but thanks to you i found the support ticket option lol thanks!
---
Sometimes I feel really bad for the survivors though
---
If the game is pretty close and they wiggle they get the hook but I've had a bunch of games where the survivors get absolutely destroyed and I still wanna give the last one the hatch even if he wiggles
---
She's still technically like 8 years old mentally (maybe younger I'm not too fresh on her lore) so the pallet stun sound kinda reflects a temper tantrum at loosing her prey
---
Annnd I still haven’t seen the movie :(
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been hearing. I’ll rethink it and post again another time, thanks!
---
Almost every part of No Escape is broken
---
why would they DC "trying to win" ?
---
You may have to go into the in-game store that's what you have to do on PS4 to actually get them.
---
Red Moris are an issue, but that just means the game can end faster and you should rethink your perception on the **game.** Just play it out and practice your looping when you see a more in play; it’s a good opportunity to practice and play a different play style.
---
This was from a long while ago
---
Looks about right. :)
---
Nobody runs from the humming though, they just become slightly more cautious for the TR.
---
Stab.
---
As survivor: Using head on never fails to make me laugh, especially when it’s super unexpected. Also everyone on the team working well together and the game goes on for a bit/feels like a fair fight. 
---
As a killer: since my rank is low and I play killer for fun, seeing baby survivors freak out and make silly decisions and scaring them as Myers. Always makes me laugh.
---
It's one extra post. Is it because I crossposted?..Sorry?
---
Explain😂😂😂

Lol I wish I got that on PS4
---
No!! Adam is a sweet teacher. He is average height in my imagination
---
Ok well like I said I'm open to suggestions on changes. You made it sound like this is awful all around but with your last comment you just think changing the percentage would be an ok change. I just used 10% as an easy number to work with. I watch alot of DBD videos and from what ive seen and how I feel playing survivors feel 0 pressure when healthy and in a chase. Maybe if being injured was an actual negative instead of activating really strong perks then you'd have more of that sense of urgency
---
Is it bad?
---
Yes you can
---
Allow the killer to have a 5th perk slot
---
I’d tap that
---
The ranking system is working like it was intended, devs stated it would match you within 6 plus or minus of your rank...
---
That it all
---
Ok thank you
---
Yeah, you can do any challenge whenever as long as you have it unlocked. I just took the shortest route to get to the epilogue then went back to do the others so I could have the next level available. I still have a couple left in 2 and 3 but can go back and do them whenever as long as the rift is still open.
---
The biggest brain killers will use DS to beat this challenge.
---
Then there’s me who hates to tunnel and never really goes for people who just got off the hook....I mean I’ll do it if I’m five feet in front of them
---
That's rough. Thanks.
---
Why do it?
---
Ok thanks! Not even sure if it will actually make a difference but I think it’ll help me feel like I’m accomplishing more lol
---
Take power naps while waiting for the lobby :forehead:
---
The play was to purposely get grabbed
---
This post is inaccurate. Dwights never leave their lockers
---
You actually look like her! That’s awesome
---
This was actually inspired by u/chamomileskye falling asleep mid-queue. Then he got me back by catching me in sleep mode in queue.
---
  Browse this subreddit while eating a piece of cake and scratching my balls...

but demogorgon is a new killer
---
Much more than I should have
---
Not even kidding I use that same style for nea
---
Tell me !! Come on!! Do iiit !! Tell me nowwww!
---
I've them kicked several times but for some reason not one is counted.
---
The archives are around permanently and not directly part of the rift.
---
autoaim is weird and hotboxes are wack
---
my favorite legion build rn is thana, ruin, nurses, discordance with the iri pin and the pin that makes people broken. the broken status feels necessary so they can't auto mend while I'm pressuring everyone else and can catch more people with nurses. I'm having a lot of success with this build at about rank 8(even without those add ons but those add ons feel optimal rn)
---
If you mean it's silly, the actual *coils* hurt the survivor. 
---
"the bloody coils exact their price and that Survivor becomes **Injured**."
---
The entity hurts them for having the audacity to disarm a padded trap.
---
only way i can deal is by not reading chat at the end of matches and leaving as soon as its over
---
"Smol Meg cant hurt you"
---
Annoyed killer main actually. Don't like other killers giving me a bad name by being unnecessarily shitty people.
---
you might not see it as a killer, but I definitely notice as survivor. When the average wait time for my survivor matches is 3-5 minutes and there's what feels like a 50% chance the killer just dodges the second we load into the lobby, it really multiplies how long I have to wait for my matches, I mean I average barely 2 matches in an hour as survivor when I can get like 5-6 killer matches in that same hour.
---
I just don't want to give killers a reason to dodge lobbies more and more. There are just as many killers out there who would rather stomp on baby survivors and hate a challenge just as there are survivors who do the same.
---
I’m not suggesting anything, not sure if you can read bud. Trying to see what people think. Never suggested they should do this.
---
son of a bitch you take my upvote
---
As much as I don't want to admit it, I sadly must.
---
^^Meg
---
I play both pretty evenly but have preferred killer gameplay recently.
---
Lmaooooo
---
That surprised me honestly
---
Or how about... get better?
---
Nah, gen speed is fine. Basically that would eliminate perks that need totems to work
---
Bloodthirsty would be the most powerful perk for either side that has ever existed. It's basically enduring and play with your food (on steroids) combined with no downsides.
---
 No Escape would be the second most powerful perk ever to exist for either side. It would give you the effects of some of the most powerful addons for huntress and clown, the effects of feral frenzy, and half of sloppy butcher all in one perk.
---
People have been posting screen shots about this that have been getting removed because of the over saturation rule number 8, devs are aware and also said we will be seeing glitch’s in the match making system over the holiday because they are trying out a few new things if I remember right on what not_queen stated on the stream yesterday
---
Face and makeup are good.
---
Just need the toboggan and you will have the Meg Griffin look spot on.
---
Wait where’s single pallet in the estate
---
Alright I do think some kind of inherent penalty should be applied when injured in general. It's not like I was taking looping away entirely just shortening how long you can do it.
---
cant we just fix the amount of BP survivors get?
---
To make SWF less annoying to go against, they need to buff solo survivor in ways that wont affect swf, like adding kindred to base kit, then nerfing survivor as they seem fit after solo is actually decent to play.
---
Wow an original, funny meme. Take my upvote
---
Freddy cosplay: 400 upvotes
---
Makeup test with attractive girl: 2200 and climbing
---
Forreal? Why couldn’t they just leave it how it was before.
---
Keys are fine the way they are
---
I was going to suggest this. Bond, Prove Thyself, Sprint Burst or better together, and a toolbox really help.
---
Oh cool I didnt get a chance to watch the stream but this is good they are looking into it atleast.
---
Oh. Thanks it’s kinda confusing and he shouldn’t plagiarise but thanks for clearing it up.
---
Looks good! How's your sprint, though?
---
I don’t think the key should break but it would close as soon as 1 person jumps in
---
Oh, the internet...
---
I'd wager $250 over the last 5 months
---
I thought about this or seen the idea posted around. 
---
I don't dodge as much as I used to but I think a BP bonus would incentivize killers to actually "Take on" SWF teams instead of dodging.
---
In the GameUserSettings.ini, set bUseVSync=False and FrameRateLimit=0.000000; in the Engine.ini, add the lines:
---
    [/Script/Engine.Engine]
---
    bSmoothFrameRate=False
---
Note that framerates beyond 120fps may cause problems on dedicated servers.
---
No, you milk drinker. They stole my cheese wheel
---
when the surv dcs you get an abandonment bonus, when the killer dcs you get a survival bonus and don't lose any points, since yall played streams you also get the xs bonus, you didn't really lose anything here.
---
That sounds toxic. Basically sandbagging remaining team more often than not. They are fine.
---
I like to chip then dip on survivors with my squad of edgy teenagers.
---
Also nothing is better than narrowly escaping that hatchet throw.
---
my favorites are the ones who get BT unhooked in the basement, then tank the hit on their way out of the basement. It never occurs to them that I'll just let them speed boost out with a bleed timer while I proceed to attack the unhooker "hiding" behind the hook pole.
---
That’s usually what I do as well, but it’s hard when they’re all claudettes with the same skin :/
---
This is edited
---
Well, yeah, but then that's on them
---
I use the excuse of waiting to charge my controller. I play on play station
---
Ever been to Bleakrock cave? Mysterious place. 
---
*Map updated*
---
right? all the points they could have earned get knocked down to zero for dc'ing. it's just a dick move at that point.
---
Seems genius but I can’t find engine.engine, I can only find engine.gameusersettings. Is this the right one?
---
Legion has better info, can easily chain first hits and also has a lot of map pressure. Doc game slowdown is much bigger and can prevent loops (although a good survivor can counter this) and madness in general fucks up the survivor. I fail to see how the two are related to the point of one being worse than the other.
---
I know its stupid broken, I'm trying to see how I nerf something I made
---
What about Quiet But Deadly?
---
COMPLETE 4/5 GENERATORS BY MYSELF WHILE MY TEAMMATES DO NOTHING AND THEN GET HOOKED WHILE THEY FINISH THE LAST ONE AND DON'T COME GET ME DOWN REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Haha possibly. Dead by daylight is like a drug. It's terrible for you but horribly addicted
---
Oh shit I’m stupid. Didn’t realize you said to add it. I’ll try it now. Have you been using this or no?
---
Honestly I feel like dead by daylight is a drug. It's bad for you but so addictive
---
I don't want to be an attention seeker but I actually made a very comprehensive rework for Legion and I would love to see what you think: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecjybe/after\_some\_careful\_consideration\_i\_made\_a\_legion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecjybe/after_some_careful_consideration_i_made_a_legion/)
---
Everyone says oh why did they nerfed legion they fucking buffed him only cause one perk build is now slightly worst it doesn't mean that they nerfed him they buffed him!
---
blendettes would like that
---
Probably not. He was recovering from  the whiff
---
You are a master
---
Gracias
---
Or when they waste a pallet to stun you even do they are injured and you were in his power mode
---
So basically turning Quiet But Deadly into an indestructible N.O.E.D. with 0 Terror Radius
---
another thing to add in the killer rulebook for survivors smh.
---
I wonder how many gens ive kicked that had a survivor on the other side.
---
I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess.
---
No problem, have fun.
---
(If your character starts warping around or something, that might be caused by the server being unable to handle your framerate. So while I don't know whether there actually will be issues, keep in mind that if there are, it could be caused by your framerate.)
---
You had me until the speed changes. I'm fortunate enough to have played back when nurse was 115% base and let me tell you it was very unfun.
---
💙❤️💙
---
Nurse is always going to be unfun. Its the power, not the speed.
---
...Did I say it was toxic? Literally anywhere in my post?
---
They should legit have a Meg skin for Legion or vice versa. Just a hoodie, braid on the side, her mask, etc.
---
Just need to find the totem....
---
This could work it's not too big of a change and still gives him counter play
---
The middle of the ramp on the collector. It’s camouflage trap with no addons and partly under a slab of wood, kind of like the spot in middle of killer shack. 
---
On the stairs in the game map, not on top or bottom, ON them. 
---
Just outside the doorways on the house in preschool map to get the doorways and the window drops.
---
So I'm not the only autistic Doctor main? 
---
Anyways I find it funny he's saying you're automatically bad just because you use NOED. Did you sacrifice him before the gens were done? Love when people whine I have NOED when the game was over before we even hit endgame.
---
Both of you need to stfu. It's part of the game. Get over it. You're salty because you lost.
---
If you zoom in it looks like fengs feet start slightly further to the top, their feet don't seem to be perfectly aligned
---
Sorry, got your post and the main post mixed up with what I was typing, my apologies
---
I’ll look for it later. Someone here did a large survey of over 1500 people across one week
---
btw I think it’s extremely telling that my comment is the one that people are skeptical about but y’all don’t seem skeptical about the one saying it’s mostly killer mains. Your bias is very obvious
---
What would really help is if you had map examples so there was an in game 3d version and the 2d version, that would be awesome but this is pretty good as it is thanks!
---
I think they should just add an unlocking progress bar. Maybe some skillchecks?
---
Well , I just checked a recent video and it seems like he still is the same clown that overreacts and exaggerates with his facial expressions that make him look retarded that I remember seeing good 7-8 years ago or so.

Not sure if you've seen it but there's this [really good post by Chattywindow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a6nysq/survivor_cosmetics_for_legion_killer_versions_of/)
---
Doing the 6 traps I agreed to farm to get it. I ended up breaking Jane by picking up the trap while she stepped into it. She couldn’t do anything until I hooked her
---
No, I got him during the endgame by bloodlusting  around a pallet.  He had Adrenaline, so I'm not sure why he was complaining.
---
I really notice it a survivor and that's exactly the reason I'm proposing to incentivize playing against SWF
---
As I've said it already, I don't dodge as a killer, so I'm proposing it mainly to benefit as a survivor
---
We are farmers
---
It’s in YouTube and they talked about the match making towards the beginning
---
There is no "Should or Shouldn't" at all. There needs to be  colorblind options. Period.
---
Omg someone agrees!! LIKE WHY PM IN THE FIRST PLACE. I had to turn off pms due to this toxic community on ps4!!
---
I thought of making this yesterday lmao
---
I saw someone draw it, but not the original
---
She's in the background can't you see her
---
In the post-game chat, one of them complained about his twitch chat calling them toxic.
---
Double bp later for much less time
---
Ah, so this is what the other side of these messages look like. Pretty pathetic tbh.
---
For 25 seconds. It says the duration in your perk descriptions. It would work very similarly to bitter murmer and dark sense.
---
your username is perfect for how annoying you are
---
Did they just die? Or did they die sooner, i have not watched so
---
He’s very impressive!
---
Not every david main plays the same and why are you david main he has only one good perk that affects the game were gonna life together just gives you bp and dead hard is ok and no mither is just shit
---
Especially the part when he used the accent! He’s probably the best I’ve seen in years
---
That’s true
---
Knew what this was gonna be as soon as I saw the title. IMO this is the most satisfying thing to do in DBD.
---
So a Survivor did something explicitly against the rules. Again, not the challenge just the player.
---
Needs a bit of a sneer to be sure, but I think it's good, if needs to be brighter with that hair.
---
It’s big Chungs Meg edition

---
My mate was chased for 2 gens and camped by incidious basement bubba...
---
Who's yelling?  
---
In order for better things to come to the players, they should stand together, but that's the beauty of the game right all survivors are toxic and all killer and tunnelers and hook campers. They divide the ranks and in the meantime can do as they please... It's like talking about politics whether your right/left wing you'll always get some uptight asshole against you that doesn't understand that that is exactly how they want you to think and while you're divided the guys in charge profit and let the "little people' fight amongst themselves.
---
And it'll never get better, because 95% are to dumb to realize when they are put over a barrel and taken dry up the ass with extra talcum powder...

It's not fun, but... it's just the way it is!

I also only want genuine answers please. Actually curious here, and not looking for jokes or sarcasm
---
They should at least make it a full 7 days of double blood points since we ain’t getting a Xmas event. 4 days ain’t shit and people gotta work...
---
Must have been a different post oops
---
It may be optional but it has lore associated and some people want to get all the lore
---
“Them” is often used as a singular pronoun when the identity/gender of the third party is unknown.
---
He’s woke
---
Literally no idea lol
---
That could be right when you run up to them they have a skill check ping, rather take the extra second or two to hit that than alert the killer
---
Because I have most of the teachable perks and I like david the most. It's worth starting with david purely for we're gonna live forever because then you can level up the others faster. Dead hard is a lot more than just an ok perk, it's one of the best perks in the game ( when it doesn't lag). No mither is shit yes I agree lol.
---
If we're talking who the best to start is based on teachables then I would say probably Dwight, Meg or Bill;
---
Screenshot u in a lobby with Dwight stache surf tones and relaxed jeans on
---
The virgin hillbilly VS The Chad Cannibal.
---
it also promotes killers to bring their better add-ons and Mori's. To "put the toxic SWF in their place" so I'm still not for it in that regard. Since there's the common stigma that all SWFs are gods and toxic that the killer should be doing the same.
---
They didn’t dc because of the challenge they dcd because they couldn’t take being downed near the basement and being put in it. So instead of hanging on and getting back in the game they think to themselves “I wouldn’t rescue a noob down here. Might as well leave”
---
At least the stacking dc penalty keeps these dc rage quitters out of games more than they can get into.
---
YEZZSZZZ
---
As one of the 8 Jane mains in existence, I’m with you.
---
Ss yourself in a lobby with Dwight stacks relaxed jeans and surf tones on
---
😏
---
Wait he did..... the period!!!!
---
You need to look way more inconvenienced.
---
Ah I see. I've learned that Legion does a lot better if you don't focus on their power unless the survivors are together or for managing gens.
---
I don’t know why we need something innovative. This is a really good idea.
---
Well what's your solution? I honestly can't think of one to nerf obnoxious "We're gonna lead the baby killer to your locker, have him pick me up and I DS him, then you head on him while I flashlight him for my juke montage." SWF that wouldn't be unfair towards typical "I'm playing with my friend" SWF. 
---
And yes extra bp wouldn't solve the problem, but I'd be more likely to simply bite down and bear it knowing I'm going to be "compensated" in case I end up having to deal with x4 OoO teabaggers with flashlights, instead of simply noping the fuck out of a lobby with 2 .ttvs, a full Legacy jake with a toolbox, and a P3 Claudette with a flashlight. 
---
Sorry for rambling here but yeah I honestly don't know how to fix it. Hard-penalties to the SWF players like 75% gen speed or an extra gen to finish would make many people just drop the game. Killer buffs like a 5th perk slot would result in casual groups of friends just playing together having to deal with a stronger-than-normal killer even if the survivors are not so much stronger than solos. 
---
Any solutions you can think of?
---
Yup and you know there will be the “COSMETIC DROP” to go right with it so they are making optimal $$$$ while people poor in for the new tome...
---
Yeah, she is t-bagging right next to the Wraith!
---
I would actually put claudeted there too because of sc I think its pretty meta to heal yourself without teameates
---
Dat picture quality tho....
---
&gt; This low tier crap needs to get off dbd.
---
Lots of memes posted here are basically low tier, but they get upvoted so much, I doubt much will change.
---
clown was based off of a real person, so this is all around possible!
---
Literally unplayable.
---
where do you get the pants?
---
More like a game from the PS2 days and BhVR Interactive is rather big with a decent cash flow now and it’s a lack of management and decent coders in which BhVR has neither. 
---
Hell they shut down Blood Garden.
---
lol
---
They can both swap out the ability to down survivors for a debuff attack that disables your ability to complete objectives until you perform a healing channel on yourself. They also never lose track of survivors, and suck big fat donkey balls in chases.
---
Main difference is Doctor causes hallucinations, and Legion runs faster.
---
Slightly offtopic, but:
---
I encountered a total Noob Bill as Impossible Skillcheck Doc lately. I didn´t realize this ofc, until he was in Tier 3 Madness, he legit screamed his Lungs out, failing the Check each time.
---
I felt really bad for him, so i bashed him down and carried him to the (still closed, there was someone left) Hatch and searched the last Guy. He got up with Unbreakable, and continued to scream at top volume for literally over a minute before DCing.
---
I felt so bad i tried to talk to him Postgame, but he was long gone, and he didn´t accept my Friend Request (I don´t blame him for that, i also wouldn´t).
---
Bill from Ormonds, the Red dressed german Doctor Player truly feels sorry for technicly ruining your Experience, forgive me
---
Good luck with catching anyone with this addon xD
---
Honestly I've been having more difficulty with the ark sense challenge than the middle three challenges
---
You reminded me, today I pit a trap on the stairs that lead to the pig killing place that has a vault into a drop on The Game, it was COMPLETELY invisible, it was at the top of the stairs
---
I don’t think mechanically speaking the game is sided either way. The problem comes with maps, as maps tend to be sided one way or the other. New map is super survivor sided while maps like the Game are super killer sided.
---
Yes, that's exactly it
---
Why 精神？
---
FUCK YOU DEVS YOU LAZY ASS UGLY LOOKING CUNTS
---
Gotcha, To the Extreme, and Courage are much too strong.
---
Gotcha: Free injury, not much to say about it, it's just wildly unfair to the survivor.
---
To the Extreme: I don't know if you wanted to put a cooldown or duration on this effect but I'm going to assume that the no scratch marks effect lasts 3 seconds after vaulting (like how Dance With Me works). This perks is a stronger Dance With Me with no cooldown and would make ending chases too easy.
---
Courage: The devs have been very careful about adding anything that makes gen repair faster and that's for a good reason. Also 15% speed buff is bannanas, that would make a survivor literally un-catchable without bloodlust even if they were just running in circles around a rock.
---
Savior: This one isn't as unbalanced as the others, but the devs have also been very careful about the endurance effect since mettle of man was nerfed.
---
Complete in a single trial
---
Boop
---
I know, I wouldn´t DC. It is not the Killers fault or the challenge or whatever. I kept doing it and at some point he had to hook me on another hook and failed his challenge. Obviously he was pissed because I didn´t gift him the challenge even though the game was pretty much over. 
---
I mean the first 2 people got hook in the basement and both instantly killed themselves even though I was trying to rescue them.
---
And yeah the last person gave up and tried to help the Killer with his challenge.
---
Don't do this to me. Oh god.
---
As one of the maybe 11 Bubba Mains who play normally, I offer you a Bowl of Chili.
---
It´s Pork, trust me
---
The game has some of the highest concentration of safe pallets in the game. It used to be a bad survivor map but that hasn’t been true for awhile
---
Thank you for the boop, you are now blessed.
---
I am a survivor main, but I do play killer occasionally. I would say I am a casual player, I usually try my best but I don’t care about rank or using meta perks etc

WHY ARE TOME CHALLENGES DONE ONE AT A TIME, ANY OTHER GAME ISNT LIKE THIS WHAT IN THE FECK
---
Just mend in front of them right after while you watch them go somewhere else. 8/8
---
As a Legion main I couldn't help but love this!
---
It depends on your teammates. If the other survivors are useless then it’s practically a 1v1 at that point and Killer will almost always win. If survivors are a god team, then Killer feels powerless.
---
Beside the meg meme, I feel like you like you have to go for a more dirty look. It looks a bit to clean.

Exactly!

r/StabbyGang
---
I personally have not found that to be the case, and I've seen enough people on this subreddit talk about long killer queues that I question that statement. Either way it doesn't really affect the point, if rank 15 and higher killers have long queues then they would absolutely be negatively impacted by splitting the survivor player base with even longer queues.
---
Except they're doing it at the slowest rate possible and most health changes are just fixes to newer fuck ups. Not older problems.
---
Only reason you should be using this perk is if you're low level and have no better perks
---
*getting looped*
---
Man, this survivor's pretty good. Respe-

*clickclickclickclick*

Very legal and very cool.

Even if we defend BHVR and take their word about fixing bugs. They still wouldn't fix any bugs. This is what? 3-4 years old and we still have game breaking spagetti code around
---
But wait... the survivor has plunderers instinct and ace in the hole. They got a purple tool box...
---
Rip
---
I had a spirit one game dedicate the entire game to defending her Ruin. Like she wouldnt even chase past 15 feet from her Ruin. 
---
Apparently they get statisfation of survivors having to power thur 5 gens with Tier 3 Ruin. 
---
 Just a really really boring game over-all and a big waste of time. Dont be like these killers.

As a general rule for me, I give about 3 downs for them to get the memo. That's already breaking the law, I can't risk any more than that for fear of the entity sending me to the gallows!

I SUPPORT YOU, BITCH! &lt;3
---
I heard that your sword can’t even cut butter. I can enchant it for you
---
That is bubba for you when BHVR will buff him so they stop being only good at this who fucking knows
---
I recommend spine chill so you know when to get going or hide and avoid running at all
---
Also you can use it to determine when stalking killers like ghost face and Myers are stalking, or when undetectable killers like spirit, wraith, pig, etc are looking at you but in stealth
---
But the instadowns are completely counterable.
---
I don’t really see anything in here demonstrating the game is killer sided
---
I’m going to be frank: this looks like the complaints of a newer player who wants the game to overall be more about stealth and little killer interaction
---
So your just admitting to being an asshole huh, is your definition of long chase longer than 50 seconds errr
---
No I mean I chase them after unhooking them and before I can start healing they self care in front of me
---
The odds that you’re the type of person to complain that killers are OP are very good
---
I get every chest I see and open it even if I dont want the item yet.  Sometimes it's too risky to get healed by a teammate.
---
Tbf tunneling is a legit tactic, even in red ranks, as it can be countered by the survivors. Yet it is kinda cheap, yadayadayada, but not gamebreaking or "not fun".
---
The killer was an asshat because he thinks swf need to be punished but you're not any better by being salty to the point you could be used as a salt mine.
---
I TOTALLY HEAR YOU, I AGREE AND I AM IN MUCH THE SAME BOAT! AT THE SAME TIME, EVEN THOUGH IT SUCKS, I STILL THINK THEY'VE GOTTA BALANCE IT FOR THE MOST PLAYERS POSSIBLE SO I GET THAT IT NEEDS TO HAVE ROOM FOR LOTS OF GRINDING FOR THOSE THAT DO PLAY A LOT! STILL DOESN'T FEEL GOOD THOUGH :P RAGE IT UP!
---
Gottem
---
Because i can. Simple as that.
---
Yeah but I'm a killer main :(
---
Unfortunately, this is the truth.  Nothing keeps people from rage quitting, especially if you're doing well enough to basement hook all of them.  The last one will always DC before you reach the hook.
---
Like cmon, just one shot multiple survivors with the chainsaw and they can never get the unhook
---
HAG SISTER, I HEAR YOU. PRO TIP SURVIVORS: DON'T TRIGGER THE TRAP IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE  ~ H A G ~
---
hey op when you ask for someones opinion on something why dont you just accept it instead of being an annoying twat and trying to argue with it or tell them their wrong?
---
I can't find it anymore tbh. But there was an update to Tap yesterday so idk if they changed it. Sorry
---
She also should be able to fuck all survivors with a dildo, making them 5000% slower and apply bleeding and hindered. Also when she looks at you you freeze, instanly get down and bleed out. Because you were genrushing, you explode when you're 4m from a survivor, making them explode at the same time. The killer also receives 6969420% bonus bloodpoints because you all survivors are too strong and they nwwd too much time to farm. Every time you run you get injured and if you're injured you get down. This killer will also be able to call out his friends, so it would be a fair 4vs69. I think this idea is perfect to balance the game. What you think?
---
But if you go to DBD in Tap it says "Global test," so maybe it'll work anyway?
---
Ok fuck you’re right I should never engage with what anyone says or offer any counterpoints. I’m so dumb. I forgot that opinions are sacred and can never be challenged
---
but you see that isn't always gonna work but nobody expects a doc to insta grab every time. 
---
Also I got bored and that is how I did my grabs I regret nothing
---
it happened to me twice. the first time i had no visible penalty and the second time i was at five minutes
---
On asylum in the main building outside the big open widowed room, place a trap on he two bricks in front of the window, they jump, snap, the run by possibly snap
---
On any map with the bus, trap on top of the tire, if no one sees you it’s almost a hair enters trap
---
On gas haven if you hear people in the garage, trap one of the two ways out the left aisle or the pallet it’s easy to farce people into it when you chase them around
---
On any map with the hill structure, trap a corner that survivors are likely to run around, I get a lot of people that way
---
I've had sessions where I suicide on first hook like 4-5 games in a row. People are that bad/dumb even in red ranks. I even run Kindred and if the killer camps/hard patrols I'll *still* see everyone on the team get off gens and Urban around corners. 
---
The most satisfying feeling is doing a 3-4 minute chase with zero gens popping, seeing everyone urbanly evading, suiciding on hook, an then that turns into a chain reaction of everyone else either suiciding on hook too or just DC'ing lmao.
---
ABSOLUTELY! SOMETIMES WE JUST NEED TO COMMISERATE WITH OUR FELLOW PEOPLES ABOUT BULLSHIT NO MATTER HOW IMPORTANT OR BIG THAT BULLSHIT IS. I LEAVE YOU WITH A BIG INTERNET HUG AND PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU DESERVE TO FEEL GOOD, AND YOU DESERVE TO FEEL HEARD WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS EVEN IF THEY'RE TINY :)
---
They can't ban them because "they don't have proof". The same happened with Tru3 when that group of people kept sniping him and changing their names (he checked and it was them)
---
You can always get that top at the official dbd Merch store
---
Fuck
---
Does he think DC penalties are on Xbox or ps4 *IDK what system that app is for*
---
You used photoshop on this?
---
Yeah, people forget he can grab when in shock therapy mode
---
Hey, if I wanted any more lip from you I'd undo my zipper. Go back to sucking your mom's tit kid. Boomer lol.
---
It’s on xbox and apparently there’s no dc penalty yet...? According to him at least
---
with the undetectable status change, were you able to see the guy with OoO?
---
Naw he admitted in an autocomplete interview that he doesn't play video games much anymore, mostly just board games.
---
&gt;opinions are scared and can never be challenged
---
no? it's just their opinions so it's kinda stupid of you to try and change someones mind on it. like it's not a fact, youre not gonna prove anyone wrong, youre just being annoying. you asked for their opinion, they gave it. nothing more to really be said
---
also tbh I find doc camping more cheeky and toxic then bubba camping bc if survivors stay around for too long they are gonna tier up and at T3 they cant save their teammates like I am glad they are reworking him this shit is stupid xD
---
‘85 I think /s
---
And stabs and stabs and stabs. When does it stop.
---
Lmao that just sounds like the people on /r/modernwarfare that complain about "sound whoring". People will look for any excuse to make sure they can convince themselves that the person who outplayed them was cheating
---
Look a lot better than her In game.
---
That moment when the entity just hates you
---
I have frequently gone the entire duration of Ghostface’s power. Or Oni’s power. Or Michael’s power, etc. without being hit during it.
---
It’s counterable because you can still utilize pallets and windows and you have adequate information to make decisions off of.
---
Nothing I been literally saying to my friends that this system won't fix anything and will only hurt people that have bad internet and people who have their game crash often
---
Its happened to me only once before and it took me the rest of the game to figure out, i was just in confused silence
---
Hes been in and out of jail for like 10 years. Im over it lol. Much older now.
---
I have a friend who doesn't play killer and subsequently can only play survivor to a certain level because of it. Once you put hours into killing SWF lobbies you understand how hard killer can be and how one sided it definitely isn't. Especially at Rank 1. There is a reason most killers run annoying perks like Ruin and NOED. Besides, legit survivor mains are the cringey Five Nights At Freddie's crowd that migrated over anyways.
---
It was originally gonna be they all had to be there at the same time, so if one KYSed before you made someone else in basement you were screwed.
---

Lol asking for an opinion doesn’t bar me from replying to whatever it is, and it isn’t annoying to do so unless you just don’t want certain things to be challenged
---
Yeah, it's not popular with a lot of streamers though. I'd imagine Otz wouldn't do it because he likes talking to his chat in real time.
---
If you don't wanna play ranked, your casual option is KYF. The official dbd server has plenty of people playing it around the clock.
---
Same build except I think I was running Sprint Burst.  I wanted to be out when the killer came to the gen with several survivors.  
---
I did it solo and I think "knowing" where my teammates where so they wouldn't pop gens without me would be the biggest tip I can give.  Play like a killer but when you find the  survivors, do the gen.
---
Damn you got a big ass forehead . That’s a fuckin $20 cab ride from your eyebrows to your hairline

This is so true. I will give hatch 90% of the time but when they shake, they die.

I'm not sure if anything has satisfied me more in this game than getting 2+ downs in one chainsaw run.

Ok, thanks

Yup, Undetectable and Blindness both prevent the Survivor from seeing the Killer, but the Killer can still see the Survivor.

I had a killer dc when I was about to complete the 4 gens with dark sense challenge, *feelsbadman*
---
I think frequency would be better for dead by daylight get 15 basement kills maybe at least that way its a grind without the headache I really don't enjoy the in a single trial aspect I think it's just tedious not fun.
---
Easy, if someone tries to kobe 3 times and doesn't struggle in second phase, count it as a DC.
---
I do that with Ash. The only cosmetic I don't have is the Value Stop vest, but apparently neither does anyone else lmao
---
You wiggle, you die. Live or die make your choice :D
---
What I used was Dark Sense, Bond, Adrenaline, and Borrowed Time. Made sure to always do a gen with another survivor. Luckily the killer didn't spot me the whole match so I ended up popping all 5 gens
---
I know. Just a unrelevant post on this sub imo.

See, shit like this is why this community has zero faith in the reporting feature. Behaviour makes up a million and one reasons why toxic assholes don't deserve to be banned. You'd think it would be an easy formula of "you're a toxic cunt so you're banned" but I guess BHVR realizes that half their playerbase would be gone if they got rid of these awful people.
---
I mean, it took them like 2 years to permaban Ochido, someone who literally made an entire career on being a toxic asshole, ruining the game for others, and doing everything in his power to ignore DbD's ToS.
---
They drop the pallet when they see the red stain so if youre close when you spin around you should make it
---
I just wanted to make people aware of this silly mistake because not everyone plays in German and wouldn’t know this :D
---
I think it’s funny because this is a rather stupid oversight
---
if u run infectious then discordance, if not BBQ or run both.
---
I mean I have too, but how often do you go the full duration? 50/50 at best I'd bet. I would bet for the large majority of players its 50/50 or less on insta downs and escaping them. There have been times I've avoided insta downs bu the point is that there is no comparable advantage for survivors. I'm not even doing the whole "omg killers are over powered" I just think that insta downs are unfair and if they aren't unfair why not make every killer just one hit and you're down? 
---
Anyway I'm pretty equal between killer and survivor main I enjoy both but I find getting a 4K as a killer is way easier than everyone getting out on the survivor end. Maybe its just my experience.
---
FACECAMP MODE ACTIVATE
---
But there'd be so many factors to consider. Besides, people would just afk. Forcing suicide and DC penalties onto an unbalanced game is going to kill it.
---
I played against two OoO yesterday on The Game and I swear, every time I got close to them, they stopped/started tea-bagging, ran to a loop or wouldn't come towards me (say, if they were already about to run into me.)
---
For everyone's satisfaction, I fucking ruined the entire team as a Pig with brown add-ons but I have no idea how they kept knowing when I was close.
---
I can only speak for PC right now but it's a buildable timeout from lobbies after a dc for any reason, including load screen freezing. 1st offense is 1 minute timeout, not sure about 2nd, 3rd etc but I know that it does compound.
---
I got lucky and had a pig that memed with two survivors and me and my friend went around with toolboxes and prove thyself and did four gens while they were booping snoots.
---
I actually played against a Proxy Camping Doctor with Make Your Choice and *Furtive Chase* of all fucking perks.
---
I mean it was certainly an interesting build, and he was certainly effective ~~at being an asshole~~ but uhhhh... he didn't win the game. After awhile we just did gens while he facecamped and 3 people got out.
---
**:OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
---
*Sits for 30 seconds like this.*
---
Yeah it helped with my first time doing it unless you get a stealth killer it is really easy to do
---
This is the challenge that has taken me the longest so far with this new tome level, I beat the 4 kills in the basement by getting overly altruistic survivors on my second try but this one has taken me so many games to do
---
Dude i have almost the same cosmetic set up on hag, simply becuz its disgusting lmao
---
Yeah I was struggling so I put it on just to test it and was surprised when it worked then the next game hit 10 in a row with out needing the perk lol
---
They said no in the q and a because they want it to be more centered around the rift
---
So did the infinitely harder ones like the 4 gens with dark sense but not the hust do 10 Genes?..... WHY!
---
It's not the fact that it's hard to kill everyone in basement. A killer can do a build a do that fairly easy, it's just that if a survivor dc's it denies you the sacrifice and you have to do it all over again because someone can't accept they lost.
---
As for the dark sense, it's honestly the hardest one on standard terms (basement one is only hard because dc's don't count) because it relies on the killer not noticing you and your team never doing more than two gens without you. Seriously if that second gen pops while you're getting chased or working on a gen or doing literally anything other than running around like a headless chicken waiting for a gen to be near done then you have already failed and gotta try again
---
I prefer Prove, Better Together, Bond and Dark Sense. Prove for speed and BT and Bond to see other Survs and go to they gen. If you can you may pick purple toolbox with Brand New Parts and offering for start in the same place
---
Great satisfaction
---
I just started playing her and I find this combo hilarious. Surprised I've never seen a Hag rock it.
---
I usually just say gg wp.  They're wanting salt, best to not let them know they got under your skin.
---
Play pig all traps come off the survivors first box

I’ve been in so many games recently with people telling me to stop getting a chest and then later I end up being given a purple med kit and some random add ons. Feels nice.

---
I use the hollowed blight arm, thats the only difference lol
---
I fail to see how getting better will make SWF less unbearable.
---
I was so annoyed getting the challenge for opening the exit gate, I was leaving it 99% and then never getting the chance to open it... so I had to be selfish just once to get it.
---
That's the issue with challenges and achievements like the Evil Within and Six Feet Under, assholes will deny it because they can. If DCs counted towards them, there would be no problem. This isn't a challenge of "Can you do X?" because the answer is "of course," the challenge is to try and find people that will let you complete it.

Myers is one of my favorite killers to go against. i'll be looking around while working on a gen, when suddenly i scope that white face. always gives me a jump. good times
---
It doesn't. It just gives you extra BP to take the sting away
---
Yeah for sure. I'm on PS4 though, so I don't have to deal with the end game chat lol.
---
Oh, you thought it was your choice? :)
---
haha yes thank you :3 i'm still working on it :D
---
I play killer more than survivor but I don't think the game is survivor sided nor do I believe there's anything to convince you otherwise in a post as short as this. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Both survivor and killer have large skill ceilings and the better team has a better chance of winning but it's not guaranteed because RNG permeates multiple levels of this game. 
---
Maps are randomly generated. Depending on the tiles, windows, and pallets, it could be survivor or killer sided. Some maps allow you to see the tiles and pallets before running to them with lots of long wall tiles, others have a bunch of useless four walls, and others are enclosed rooms with no way of knowing if that pallet has been used or if one spawned at all. 
---
Ranks mean nothing in terms of skill. How good the killer or survivors are is random. People say survivor is easy to rank up and I agree. But I've also heard people say ranking up as killer is difficult and I just don't agree whatsoever. It feels just easy, if not easier, to rank up as killer because you're not relying on your teammates to be good, you're relying on you and only you being good. But just as easy as it is to pip up, it's equally easy for someone to wait for rank reset, create a smurf account, or just throw a few games to derank. 
---
Not only is ranking too easy to inflate or deflate, both sides have access to overtuned items, addons, and offerings to drastically shift the favor to one side. Moris are busted. Commodious toolboxes are ridiculous. Pink killer add ons are usually too strong. Medkits make healing take no time at all. So even though the skill ceiling on both sides is high, there's no way of knowing what kind of game you're getting unless you're the killer that can see the items beforehand. This is compounded by the fact rank once again means nothing in terms of skill and is highly exploitable. 
---
So if maps are randomly generated, ranks are useless and therefore your teammates/opponents are of highly varying skill, the killer and item addons are both powerful and mysterious, the game is RNG. **There is no killer or survivor sided.** It's whatever the fuck matchmaking and map generation decide to give you. 
---
Here's my anecdotal experience playing killer at red ranks. A strong killer will almost always have the advantage against four randos of varying skill and stunted efficiency due to lack of communication. If the other side coordinates well and use better pathing and mindgames than me, I think they deserve to win. That being said, it is extremely rare for a team to be better than me and to play efficiently. 
---
TLDR: You can't take this game seriously at any competitive level because so much is RNG or not at all indicative of skill.

I got reset to 9 currently, but before I was at 8 which was my best killer rank ever.
---
At rank 8 I had 20+ games in a row were not a single survivor was my rank or even green rank.
---
Usually people were rank 5, sometimes with a red rank mixed in.
---
I really felt cheated out of my fun: I could either play Freddy in full sweat mode and have some games with decent results or try to get daylies on other Killers or challenges with the Trapper (which I don't feel I suck at) and get absolutely shit on by survivors that knew the location of every pallet and every loop.

As someone pointed out, bad matchmaking is terrible: if you get matched against noobs you just feel bad for them. If you get matched with people that own your soul because they have hundreds or even thousands of hours on me, it just makes you want to uninstall

Increase Pig’s Crouch movement speed to 115% or have RBTs activate on unhook and have the timer increase 15-20 seconds if the survivor gets downed.

Julie isn’t taller than Frank, it just looks that way because Frank is pretty upright whereas Julie kind of tilts her head and slants her hip in the lobby so she looks slightly shorter. All of the Legion Members are pretty much the same height
---
Only if you do it softly
---
yea, my dozen of messages I got from killers justifying their holding the game hostage, excessive slugging(by excessive I mean literally just having 3+ people downed on the ground and letting them bleed out), proxy camping with Mori's, and complaining that I'm using OP mechanics too with SWF (which most of the time I'm not in a SWF and if I am it's with 1 other person), begs to differ. They don't do it regardless most of the time, a lot of killers justify using it to combat the SWF, and if they for sure know it's a SWF they will do 1 of 2 things, back out or be equally as toxic as they assume the SWF would be to them. It's no secret that a handful of killers have basically guaranteed win add-ons and when paired with a Mori, there's usually no point to playing survivor against them.
---
because SWF is a guaranteed win I guess.
---
That's a thing you can do to change the visual style of the game, and is by no means a hack.
---
thanks to you too, id send a message but idk how to because im newer to reddit. i only know how to post and stuff like that
---
I can definitely agree
---
Lol, saved if you like it or not
---
I can concur
---
Franklin's demise, lightborn, mad grit, brutal strength.

I wish you nothing but the best on your journey.
---
Then its worthless imo.
---
I dropped the last survivor at the exit gates so he could power them before the other survivor died on hook, and I contemplated killing him as soon as he did it so that I could get the NOED challenge.
---
Bond, ProveThyself, Dark Sense and Dead Hard for the chases, always stay with the other survivors.
---
Provethyself is kinda like bait since survivors will want to stay with you for the gen speed boost
---
I usually kick and run. Im an avid surveilance user lol.
---
Lemme guess another one of his special abilities is that he can grab survivors by the neck and after 3-5 secs he can mori them and couns-*cough* survivors can prevent this by stabbing the killer with ig max. 3 pocket knives which conveniently lie in some chests
---
To call her may deadly is assuming she’s the most deadly of the Seven Sins AND Four Horsemen. We’re doomed
---
Sounds about right. I was on the hook on the hill, and instead of coming to get me so I could finish my challenge, I got to watch a claudette pop the last gen I needed then urban around the hill, wasting enough time to let me die.....
---
No worries, I sent you one
---
That happened to me with a gf too wtf is this game lol
---
Oh jeez. Everyone’s taking about scratch marks and auras. I haven’t even thought of this. We need change!
---
Ah, I asked bc a lot of people accused some people ik a while back of streamsniping otz after they got him a few times
---
I just bought the skin. It's easily one of the most terrifying ones in the game! The severed board's head, with antlers violently shoved through its eye sockets?? Damn! And then it's got the gnarly bloody flesh hanging off the antlers too. I would be genuinely frightened to be chased by that XD
---
i can’t stop laughing at meg’s height 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
It's a strategy in which the killer focuses down on a specific survivor, regardless of whether or not theres an easier to hit survivor in the way, such as  going for one that just got unhooked. It is a decent way to take a survivor early out of the game, seeing as how they get a shorter hook time and die quicker, but it does ruin the fun for them if they get picked first or have stupid teammates. There are perks that discourage it, like make your choice and survivors can carry borrowed time to get them off safely and decisive strike to carry the chase on.
---
Got that one as pig with a 4k. No one booped the snoot so they had to perish.
---
I got hung on the loading screen the other night, had to force close and came back with a friendly greeting of 30 something seconds. While I'm glad they're cracking down on the scumbags that used to dc left and right, I was like o.0 You froze/failed to load!

Wraith with Ruin, HG and Thrill of the Hunt is my favourite build to mess around at the moment.

Defend the totems like a madman and watch survivors take way to many hits and waste a shit ton of time trying to cleanse them just to get hit with HG when they are double teaming the totem with a body block in front of the cleanser 😄
---
Oooooooohhhhh
---
I saw a dude he kept trying to get stunned and I thought he was doing a PWYF strat so I never dropped pallets
---
I’ve never played killer above rank twelve which is why I mentioned before this is a survivor sided POV, however I do play above rank twelve and can confirm like any other player above rank twelve that killer needs ruin in most cases to win, which is in itself an issue of game design, (only mechanic of the game is to sit on generators, devs think “how can we make that mechanic harder without deciding to make the game more unique?”= ruin was born.) I’ve seen plenty of comportent killers use the time they have to end the game in a 4K, with or without ruin. The games average time also, isn’t necessarily limited to the game as there’s no official timer, but the average game turns to be 11 minute, in a truly balanced world, 11 minutes should be enough for the killer to get two kills and for the survivors to get 2 escapes, however imo that’s not the case. Take too long, you have a game where pallets run dry and killers get increased map control as gens become closer together, game is getting genrushed, then there are pallets-a-plenty and killers have no sense of proper map control. If you added in another unique aspect to the game that requires survivors and killers to be more interactive, you would in theory be adding more time to the game, however with a new objective it compensates for the issue. My point is devs shouldn’t have to increase game time solely to make it easier for survivors or killers, but to add a new objective to make the game more fun.

The delay kills interaction with chat.
---
I'll be your friend!
---
I play on PC so that may be a small issue, but we can chat of anything DBD related if that's what you want :)

"Make up test for my Meg cosplay". 
---
This isn't a cosplay. It's a make up test for the cosplay. Cool your jets.
---
Good stuff
---
Pretty sure this is a woosh.
---
Well all I can say is that we have had different experiences
---
This challenge is impossible without DC husks.
---
Just add pop goes the weasel and there’s the standard build of any killer from rank 1-10. Maybe swap nurses calling with Noed or some sloppy butcher from time to time.
---
DCs LEFT AND RIGHT! ARGH!
---
Dedicated servers on console need to be actually good and not laggy because it’s already laggy on non dedicated servers
---
I'll be your dbd friend I'm at work rn so I can't play now but add xXbburr10085Xx if you want

A “pill shape”, that of a large upright cylinder with rounded corners, is an often default and easy-to-use hitbox for games that don’t require precise hit detection. However, in situation where attacks require precision, (such as hatchets,) there can be a large disconnect between the models of a crouching survivor and a flying hatchet, and the pill-shaped hitboxes that surround both. When those “pills” collide, even if the in-game models don’t appear to be touching one another whatsoever, a hit will be registered.
---
Lmao Xbox usually bans if you report a cuss word message go for it
---
I'm struggling with an elegant way to say that you're behaving like an asshole and advise OP to ignore you.
---
Naw.... Elf Dwights only. #SaveElfDweet
---
Thanks man, I ended up getting it due to the sacrifice of my swf, he ran a pig around the whole game so I can do gens with the randos haha
---
Can we get perks mentioned in that?
---
Bubba's perks are a lot.more useful than Billy's
---
This goes both ways.
---
Can confirm. I used to abuse Grab-Happy-Doc to win hatch standoffs back when they were a thing. 
---
Sadly the rework will have right click as zap and no treatment mode so this won't be a thing anymore. With how buggy grabs are right  now this is pretty much the only reliable way to get interrupts.
---
Wait this isn’t a !ROASTME post? What the
---
Atleast that challenge is pretty easy since you don’t have to be injured for the skill check to count
---
•Simple Trapper fix, I wish they'd just do it already.
---
•12 seconds? Jesus, not even Demogorgon has that much. 2 seconds is enough, imo.
---
•I think 105-110% would be a better choice instead of 115%, just seems a lot more fair and you'd have no reason to be in non-crouch unless you're in a Chase.
---
To slow the game down just a a big bit xd
---
First killer I leveled was the Wraith and I had next to no perks other than 1-2 from the shrine.
---
So I ran Sloppy Butcher, Bloodhound, Nurses calling and NOED.
---
NOED noobery aside, that build puts a lot of pressure on a single hurt survivor, because they just can't get away from you after the first hit that comes easy to the Wraith.
---
The tracking from Bloodhound with Sloppy is amazing, I wonder why not more people run this on Spirit.
---
Hasn't happened yet, they're still messaging me.  Is there anything you suggest I do?
---
After the holidays...
---
Its supposed to be to celebrate Christmas/New years but they do no decorations and put bp in January unlike previous years on DbD.
---
nvm took it to serious, ignore what i said
---
my fave memory when i was doing her infamous trophy was, (using a tiny marker stuck to center of monitor to use as guide) when i set myself up so that a charged shot hits anyone opening an exit gate, and one by one every one of them dropped like flies. they all assumed it was safe since i was sooo far away that there was no terror radius. they were like 'why isnt anyone opening this? thats weird. YARGH'
---
Technically they're not as it's modifying the game files. However I use them and have never experienced an issue, nor has anyone else been punished for using them, so it's pretty safe.
---
I dont think you can get banned for stream sniping. When it was happening to Tru3 they didn't do anything. You make the choice to stream your games. Bhvr doesn't care.
---
I mean they would do it even if there is no swf sign, just every time people connect at once. But I hear you.
---
Also, I'm surprised. I don't have any collection like that after 2 years of playing.
---
unacceptable behaviour, i'm proud of you
---
I think it looks amazing but the jungle him looks like it is a bit too easy to infinite. Other than that it looks really good keep going
---
It's mostly depends on rank and what your playing it on
---
How long have you been using them for?
---
Ochido is still on the loose. He's moved to PS4 and hiding all survivor/killer names to prevent anyone of figuring out what his account name is...
---
Had so many people get pissed at me when I did the NOED or basement sacrifice challenge.
---
Inversely I've had so many assholes who facecamp or hard tunnel and insist that "iT's JuSt FoR tHe RiFt!" Some challenges will always be a pain in the ass and will always force toxic gameplay (NOED challenges and anything that has to do with the basement) but it really makes me groan and roll my eyes when people play like complete cunts and justify it with "Rift lol." I did the basement hook, Obsession hook, and kick the same generator multiple times challenges playing perfectly normally, just with a few build adaptations (Obsession perks to guarantee an Obsession, Agitation cause you need Agitation for the basement hook thing anyways, and Surveillance to make kicking the same gen multiple times easier.) I did use an Ebony Mori for the "Kill the Obsession" and "End the match before the gates are powered" Rifts but I honestly think Mori hate is massively overrated.
---
Why not both?
---
As long as you have a killer that can get an easy first hit (Wraith, GF, Legion, Pig ...), the tracking becomes a piece od cake
---
I'm on xbox, in a 4 man at the moment but what's your gt and if one leaves then you can join
---
Or diversion
---
Ok this was funny lol
---
Bubba my time have come
---
One and off since around the release of Plague.
---
From what I remember BHVR said they don't have any problems with custom icons *but* if the anti cheat automatically picks them up for whatever reason and bans you then they're not going to reverse the ban. I haven't seen anyone say they've actually been banned for using them though so it's probably not a big risk.
---
Because she can't see blood when she phases without an ultra rare add on
---
I honestly just hate how some of these challanges are forging you to be a cunt to get it done.
---
Imagine being a degenerate and not being able to talk
---
This post was made by almost everyone gang
---
I don't think it would be that bad as mobile and switch run at a good speed where it's about the same as PC is right now
---
As sad as that is to hear at least he's not ruining the game on PC anymore. PC is the biggest playerbase and while my heart goes out to the console players "the biggest cunt in the universe" is just one problem you guys are going to have to deal with, along with "console turning into a jet engine" and "crashing whenever you breathe."
---
Yeah, someone fucked up.
---
The three blendettes meeting up while I’m on hook
---
It's a nice doodle, nice job.
---
Photoshop? More like MS Paint
---
It’s pretty hard to argue considering there are so many components in place. You would have to determine if we are taking perks, offerings, survive with friends and maps into consideration and which killers we are looking at, and most importantly, what contributes as a win before you start arguing this. 
---
The game is generally survivor sided if all the survivors are very good at the game and the killer isn’t using anything special. But this is rarely the case. I’ve never run into an unbeatable squad (I play on ps4 though). 
---
If the survivors and the killer aren’t that good, then solo survivors are definitely the weakest role in the game in my opinion, and if I recall correctly, most players played as solo according to BHVR’s stats.
---
he explained it better than i ever could
---
Yeah I’m never going to do it again next time I will be so fucking toxic
---
The better you are the better you can deal with good survivors.
---
Shut up Meg!
---
Bubba with PWYF as well
---
basement bubba gg ez my man
---
And even if you run the ultra rare add-on, blood is already brighter while phasing anyways.
---
Im in purple ranks where every god damn team has mics and get 2 gens done in 30 fu king seconds and avoids the basement like the god damn plague
---
I’m a simple man. I see HunterxHunter I up vote.
---
I do agree bone clapper 10-12 is a bit much, I couldn’t think of a decent replacement for it was kinda thinking on the spot.
---
Pig however even if they re-buffed combat straps I’d be happy with that
---
Nice! ya I've been doing the nemesis/pwyf combo on Legion. Works great. Seems like it would be really good on LF
---
If you were infinite EW1 then you got lucky and had the perfect counter to OoO which is the undetectable status.
---
Pig Ghostface and EW1 Myers all have the undetectable status effect and they can see the survivor who's using OoO but the survivor can't see the killer while they have that effect. 
---
Undetectable status is ridiculously good, I remember going for adept Laurie and I ran into pre-rework Fredward and it was terrible because I  couldn't see his aura even though he could see mine.
---
Basement bubba only works if the survivors are brain dead. Once they realize you’re camping near the basement with insidious, your whole build is ruined
---
Well put.
---
damn
---
Chased the first survivor I found around and around the same pallet for two minutes or more earlier to get my 90s chase with Distressing challenge done. Blood lust 3 is super speedy. 
---
Another survivor had the audacity to teabag at the exit gate as if I'd been playing with a mite of sincerity.
---
Call xbox if they ban you. You have screenshots of the convo.
---
Used in a team on coms, Object is devastating.
---
yeah i suppose, only other thing i can think of is use a small map offering, then do slug billy or bubba with enduring agitation
---
Make it at least 2 in the basement that shits do able but 4 in single trial i almost had then 2 people dc cucking me over
---
That's on you m8, it came out in October.
---
oh yeah i would imagine dcs all day, but hey dc punishment coming soon
---
Myers can use Nemesis pretty well since one of his add-ons makes stalking his obsession really fast. Plus the oblivious is really nice when you have a huge TR. Can also combo well into Dark Devotion. Get stunned by obsession, slug him and hunt for other survivors while undetectable in T3.
---
Yeah I have more fun as killer too because at least you won't die on your first hook. Heck you won't die at all.
---
F tho
---
Leorio approves this message
---
Myers with Judith's Journal and PWYF. He gets stunned and can stalk and lose chase for the speed. Tier 3 and faster speed.
---
Nice! I forgot about that Addon! that's sweet. thanks
---
I don't disagree, but the map is really small which favors the killer.
---
Lot of safe pallets though
---
