How did that hit you when you vaulted the window you fully vaulted it and got actually managed to run a little.
---
---
---
At least before there were lots of r1 players. Now I'd bet 0.0001% of players are there.
---
You are learning grasshoppa lol.  Yeah that's pretty much it.  I play predominantly Wraith, Trapper, Pig and Freddy, but mix in some Billy, Doctor and Myers here and there too so it works with any killer.  
---

---
Perk wise my staples on most killers are Ruin, Overcharge, Save the Best for Last and Enduring.  First two help slow the game down.  Overcharge is particularly useful for 3 genning survivors at end.  Last two make you efficient as hell in chases.  Obviously some killer specific swaps, I would throw bbq in place of STBFL on Billy for example.  
---
That's exactly it though don't overcommit to any one survivor.  Especially the teabagging, flashlight clicking obsession.  He is just baiting you into chasing him for the next 3 gens.  Just laugh at their attempts to tilt you into throwing the game and stick with the plan.  Another reason why I love stbfl it encourages you to ignore obsession until the games progress makes sense to chase them.  That in and of itself will win games for you.  Eventually you'll pick them off one by one and since you are pressuring gens so aggressively you're getting tons of bloodpoints by not tunneling and resorting to camps and such.  Fun games for both sides and consistent wins for you once you get it down.    Good luck man.
---
Spot on. It’s much easier to say “I was genrushed, fuck those survivors” than it is to look at yourself and how you play the game. 
---
Bro is that Squidward?
---
We'll make it was not working for me so no faster heals doesnt work when i have BT and WGLF on
---
That's a lot of hoops to jump through when the answer is simply that the angry guy simply doesn't have much in the way of reading comprehension. Don't defend him.
---
There's a dropdown on the right side of the temple (when facing it from the front) where u can instantly get right next to the basement/gen

Gotta admit, they had us in the first half
---
That's fucking awesome bro
---
Wait what is this sorcery? A Redditor giving creds to the original author?
---
This has been happening to me on both killer and survivor. Not a fun time
---
You had a close game that ended with two kills? Sounds like it was a pretty balanced game then since 2 kills per game is what they try to balance around. Plus you did it with one of the worst killers in the game depending on the add-ons you used.
---
The spawns are pretty predictable on most maps. I haven't learned Ormond yet, but for the most part you'll be able to run a loop around the map and check all possible totem locations in a minute or two. Throw in one teammate helping you or a bit of luck and you'll be able to consistently knock out totems quickly.

&gt;base 10 second immunity for unhooked survivors
---
Right, that's a good suggestion, and the kind of thing I'm thinking about. For the same reasons you mentioned, as well: it creates consistent gameplay for both sides, where you don't have to play around the possibility of certain perks being in play, or use perks that do it for you. And more than providing soft incentives against tunnelling, it would make tunnelling "okay". Alternatively, an unhooked survivor could simply be healthy, rather than injured.
---
I also agree with your qualifier. I already think Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike should not work after the gates are powered (and if yesterday's hotfix hasn't changed anything, BT currently actually doesn't), and the same should apply to any base mechanics that would replace them.
---
#GOTTA LOVE COMCAST 
---
You say shitpost but I say logic.
---
I find that ruin is shit for both sides. Survivors struggle to do gens and when ruin gets cleansed right away killers feel like crap that they are down a perk all game. I literally SPAWNED on ruin in a game yesterday. 
---
Always blue for bubba
---
As a bubba main, I fucking hated getting the mask but it's definitely the best mask and most noticeable 
---
Excuse me
---
I say bring these back but up the point totals, make them weeklies or something.
---
If you want to avoid something that people get banned for don’t tunnel? I don’t see the correlation here partner. 
---
Rank 3 Killer V.S. Rank 10 Survivors.
---
I'll never get tired of clips where people look away for a half second and somehow he's THERE
---
What is m1? I play console soooo.is that the stab?
---
Trapper's power is deceptively difficult to master. He's considered easy because he's easy to pick up and play, but he requires attentiveness, creativity, and tactical prowess to actually master. 
---
Bill, if we're talking about his three unique perks, are actually riskier than David's to use or are outright situational. I'm a huge fan of the Left 4 Dead series, though, so I can't not play him. 
---
What are your preferred loadouts on your mains? 
---
I can't help but imagine you typing this with cheesy Dorito dust fingers
---
unless it’s the last one and you see the noed coming
---
Yikes.
---
Oh now that's hot
---
Happens to Billy too
---
I played my second game of killer ever as wraith a few days ago and fought a swf with flashlights 7-8 levels higher than me. I was wrecked so hard 
---
What are we looking for here? Just a camping killer?
---
On PC there's an achievement tied to it, for people who haven't yet it feels satisfying to reach rank 1 for the first time, you're less likely to get purple and green ranked players who have less experience, you're more likely to be challenged by optimal teams, etc. The deeper into red ranks you go, the more red ranks you'll face. More red ranks means a higher chance of facing experienced survivors and not just breezing through the matches. There's plenty of reasons to want to reach rank 1. Of course they're pretty much all unimportant but they're there. If the devs add some sort of reward or incentive for reaching rank 1 (which they have implied will be added in the future), then this current system is a bust. 
---
Nice!! Lol. I guess Nurse would be one killer it would always work on at least, since they never have Enduring, as long as you aren’t slugged obviously. I just hate that the shitty tunnelers know all they have to do is use Enduring and it kills it completely. 
---
How often are you having success with it? 
---
Yess. I had to keep faithful to the game somehow hahaha.
---
Basically. Just seems to happen a lot again, especially with the plague. (At least for my experience)

That’s literally exactly what I said...
---
That is you making an assumption that any of us are "teammates". I go in solo, I survive. The game is built around this, hence why literally in the trailer they are ignoring a hooked person to try and survive. 
---
You're thinking of Detective's Hunch for finding totems. Detective's Hunch shows you totems when a gen is completed. Stakeout gives you great skill checks if you hit a 'good' skill check and have a token.
---
 
---
&gt;When completing a Generator, the Auras of Generators, Chests, and Totems within **32**/**48**/**64** metres are revealed to you for **5 seconds**.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;When *Stake Out* has at least **1 Token**, Good Skill Checks  are considered Great Skill Checks and consume **1 Token**.
---
“I’m going to stop playing this game because it’s so broken right now!”
---
*One Hour Later*
---
“Okay for real this time!”
---
Haha. I just started playing again and all my killers have either iron grasp and/or agitation on them XD. Those were dark days.
---
Plague's side boob looks like a fucking potato.
---
I vaguely remember avoiding Rituals most of the time due to how pathetic they were.
---
No I'm saying small game is better for finding totems
---
That was my point you god damn twat. What was so fucking difficult to fucking understand? The fucking OP post is titled "I feel like we're almost there in terms of balance" Were you fucking dropped on your fucking head? 
---
Idk why this made me laugh so much lol good one m8
---
Nope we're not blessed at all. As we're getting more Perks with new dlc, the amount of bp for solid builds increases dramatically. Farming for a long time is getting unenjoyable really quick imo
---
Can I be honest? Doesn't look like you were completely annihilated from here. You weren't useless and scored over 10,000 points, which I'd consider a win in my book. 
---
..Stakeout doesn't find totems though.
---
I mean you have said that it is a boring and annoying way to play. It's just not, it's how you play the game. 
---
I checked the updates on Steam and there is nothing new after what I already saw on Tuesday
---
I've had generators pop faster than I could even get over to them. When I first hit mid ranks I assumed survivors started on the opposite side of the map as you so I ~~ran~~ slowly walked over there and still had it finished before I got over there. Yes, all 4 were working on it. 
---
WOOO
---
On plague I use ruin,corrupt,nurses, and infectious fright .. for spirit I use ruin,nurse,sloppy butcher, noed
---
Look at the bottom most perk of his during the beginning part of the clip. Distortion activates 3 times anytime your aura would've been revealed to the killer, and hides your aura instead. You can see the counter decrease, and the cooldown on the perk
---
I have no clue if they did this on purpose or not. I went downstairs and saw scratch marks leading into the locker as well as a noise indicator saying they jumped into it. I put a trap down next to the (wrong) locker they were at (since i just needed to get my trapper daily) and walked away. I came back and checked the other locker to see this. They stayed in there for a while and never left. Eventually they disconnected after having crows for a while. 
---
Uhh no? Blocking a killer from hooking another survivor? They get really salty from that 
---
It really does look like a potato.
---
This is giving me PTSD...
---
I think its just "The Last Mask" Should get you there I believe. 
---
I agree, this is the most ridiculous bs I have ever seen.  They make it easier for the killers to kill, so you don't escape, and you don't pip! so what the hell kinda fun is this? Why play a game where you die almost every time, and you never pip?
---
Ah, I get what you mean now.
---
Totally agree. It took me less than a week or two to realize that the only truly viable killers were Nurse/Hillbilly due to their mobility and ability to apply map pressure. Especially as you rank up. Playing them is pretty much the only way you can 4K.
---
I feel like there’s multiple ways to fix them. Make killers slightly faster when not in a chase. Make maps smaller. Add more objectives into the game for survivors so that escaping isn’t so easy. Make gens take longer.
---
They keep doing these bandaids instead of directly focusing on the problem: Gens get done way too fast.
---
The devs "solution" to the problem with being farmed was just adding invincibility frames to survivors who get unhooked. Which didn't really fix anything because a killer could just wait 3-4 seconds (the invincibility is supposed to be a second but it's very inconsistent) for it to go away and down you again. 
---
There should have been a "reject" option so you can't get farmed but the devs were too lazy to code that in and decided to give you guys invincibility instead. 
---
No. No no. As a killer main for a long time, this new system sucks. I can sprint around all game, get 2 kills, a Mori, and 3 more hooks and still depip. The only way not to from what I’m hearing is to play the meta killers, but I don’t want to have to play 2 or three different killers just so I can have a better rank in a system that doesn’t mean anything to begin with. So screw it. The rank system was useless before, but now it’s just laughable.
---
Oh god, the Pallets. Brutal Strength felt almost required back in the day. I'm glad they fixed it (more or less), but I had a game on Wretched Shop a few nights ago that really brought back some bad memories. 
---
Except when I’m the killer, they find it immediately
---
Why aren’t his ears bleeding?
---
I read your reply to another comment. A big thing I recommend not running is NOED. Not because of the toxic meta of it- no. However because of the fact that it can be used as a failsafe for bad killers. Using NOED will (in my opinion) prevent you from properly learning killer. You'll never learn what does and doesn't waste time, you will be able to throw the whole game and still win. Most NOED users have the mindset of "even though there's still four alive, I will have noed so I can get at least a kill or two." That kind of mindset will slow or even completely prevent the learning of playing killer. However in any other situation, I'd say keep playing and practicing- look up guides and tutorials for tricks you may use ect.
---
Oink 
---
(X-Files theme) 
---
I stated my opinion that it’s boring and annoying, and you’re telling me “it’s not.” How does that makes sense? As someone who has had the game since August, 2016, I can confidently say that in my personal experience, standing in one spot holding a button down becomes quite boring. If that’s not boring for you, cool. I’m happy for ya. But, as I very clearly stated in my post, gen rushing isn’t wrong because it’s the objective, BUT... The devs need to change that. They need to add in more objectives for survivors so that escaping isn’t such and easy and quick job for them.
---
Poor gullible trapper.
---
Before I start, do the Huntress's lines just say: Aggressive Sustained Humming?
---
That’s in the sequel.
---
I'd say legion is a berserker and spirit is a monk 
---
Oh I know. It's probably just a relic of those better times for him. I don't even play him much but I feel very bad for the people who do and have been promised a rework/buff for a long time now. This seems like a very simple fix they could implement in the meantime, either rework the effect of Adrenaline vs. the dream state or remove it entirely.
---
Damn, first the bee and now the tree
---
Search before posting lmao
---
Just make 2 modes, one for ranking and one for fun, casual play. Only problem is I don't think ppl would play ranked if there was no reward.
---
No response but that. Okay this isnt worth my time if you dont want to answer anything else i said. 
---
songs pretty yikes, but other than that it good
---
I think you're massively overlooking the point that these Survivors were so new and had so little experience in the game that Ruin was an instant DC for them. Gane health is not anywhere **NEAR** what this discussion is about.
---
I have like 5 more clips of me doing the deliverance decisive combo 
---
I haven't missed ds since the update, the new bigger skill check is great and the ps4 optimization means way less frame issues
---
I suggest that you and some of those replying to yoi put some time intl researching the history of Dead by Daylight and how utterly Survivor-biased it was throughout late 2016 to early 2018. Things only started turning to a balanced game with 2.0.0 in June 2018. If you guys have just been playing for the past 3 months, then it's no surprise that you think this game to be Killer-biased, which is not the case.
---
Killers had to fight a long time for the devs to finally acknowledge the broken state of the game and that just listening to the majority of players (Survivors as there are 4x as many as Killers), was a mistake.
---
Jesus! That was amazing. Awesome writing man :) 
---
How long did this take to write? xD
---
Must be nice, Im rank 6, have played probably ten games, maybe about five of which were really strong games with 4 man survives, and barely safety pipped in all but three.  Two of those three were depips and one was a pip!   
---
Recap, one pip out of 10 games.  WTF!
---
It made me laugh. :/
---
To each their own. 
---
I’ve been working on it off an on for about a year.
---
are you saying jane is like a white oprah? because i thought that too
---
That last one is a fucking steal
---
That’s some serious *dedication.*
---
My bad, I meant small game is way better at getting rid of ruin thereby, ending it's whole career
---
The best way I can explain it is that its a prewritten code and cant distinguish if the sentence would be grammatically correct with the S at the end our without. So they put the S in parenthesis because if the sentence makes sense with an S at the end or if it doesnt make sense with an S at the end, it covers the correct grammar for both options.
---

---
~~That template is perfect~~
---
Calls for backup then immediately gets pulverized 
---
The game can't afford two modes at the moment. There simply aren't enough players...
---
The entirety of your comment is based upon me complaining about Adrenaline and DS even though the person that said that is not me. Either you're braindead, replying to the wrong person, or both. All I said was that generators shouldn't take more than 5 minutes.
---
I'm not arguing with any of your points because you haven't really said anything incorrect, aside from the fact that you think I'm someone else.
---
Now, go ahead and link me to where I complained about adrenaline. Thanks for the downvote because you can't read, btw.
---
That would be a neat feature in KYF when you're spectating
---
the sun is the flashlight 
---
You guys can’t tell me that you don’t ever feel the same way? And like I said I play as much as a killer as I do as a survivor, and being a killer is way too easy. It’s boring actually. But of course you close minded idiots don’t know how to have a proper discussion without just going back to what anybody else would typically say 
---
Your primary attack, not the lunge
---
Its the only consistently viable strat vs a facecamper tho
---
Burger King Myers could use a visit
---
^^^^^^ This person knows what they're talking about.
---
I just 4k’d with the plague using only her three unique perks and I did not get the trophy (PS4)
---
As long as there’s iri heads then insta heals are fine other than that everything is balanced.
---
This is incredible.
---
The new play mode. Adventure battle Royale. 
---
I'm usually at high ranks I just haven't played in awhile and also don't have good perks on my Jane. But my allies were goddamn morons and the Killer was downing them in 0.25 seconds. I can't babysit my entire team and also do gens for myself.
---
Ultra Rare's usually don't appear until level 30 at the earliest. Once you get to level 50 they're more common. 
---
Uh, they didn't? Two people died and the other two were on their final hook.
---
That T pose as he falls from the sky haha
---
We're idiots? I'm sure I'm not the only one who's played this game on Xbox since release and have NEVER hit the button that sets it to inverted. Sounds like something an idiot would do.
---
Yes cause removing 4 hooks in the same area is fair. Got the plague and when they try that i hit em with turbo vomit along with Franklin's Demise. Your anus is mine
---
The killer probably had Enduring. He got stunned, but the stun was very brief. 
---
Same thing happened to me, it’s so annoying especially since gaining that pip back is so hard now. I was coasting on my last pip on rank 6 and lost it to someone who did that to me WHILE IN A CHASE!!!  I always try and take a hit for someone if I unhook and the killer shows up right after but it never seems to happen for me. 
---
28.8 seconds without toolboxes, Prove Thyself, or greats. It's pretty crazy. But at least you know you gain time if you get there in time to stop completion
---
I agree with this except for spirit because whenever I play against a spirit they face camp 
---
As a p3 Bubba I want somebody to explain to me how I don't have enough fucking Jakes?
---
Or I can just ask on Reddit and watch you guys get mad for asking about it either one :/
---
One of the few issues Freddy doesn't have.
---
Gen Rushing isn’t a bad thing, it literally is the objective. Generators can go by really fast, that’s the problem.
---
Yep if the killer has enduring the stun is not existent. 
---
I asked MC\_Lean about it in his stream and he told me its probably gonna get a  change.
---
Where’s the locker?
---
It's the name of the game. Sorry that you don't understand that. Monitor nearby active hooks, one person can't reliably stop a hook unless you just keep following where they run to. I'm a killer main, but I'm not a crybaby.
---
As a Myers main, moments like these are what I live for.
---
dOiNg GeNs, YoU?
---
Lmfao good god I am peeing myself this is so funny.
---
I know. It's refreshing to see them have a sense of humor, instead of going super try hard hitting the easy kill, THEN checking the locker
---
Wow you’re lucky someone else was still there and didn’t leave or none of that would have been possible. 
---
Where is the pic from?
---
I agree with you 
---
This is actually a really good strategy. You let someone stay on the hook for 30 seconds to do a gen then u unhook them before stage 2. 
---
It would also need a Dawgs perk...where it releases the hounds and reveals the locations of all survivors for 10 seconds
---
What were the pallets like?
---
Only weak bitches DC because they're up against a killer they don't like. It ruins the game for everyone.
---
This has been the best update in a while though tbh, the map was the only drawback but that doesn't matter much to me. New killer is great, new survivor is new and different, and the performance! Man it runs better for sure, and the matchmaking is much better too. Fair play to the team for this update tbh. 
---
Also, it gives me hope for the switch version
---
Yeah, I normally play with my friends and don't have any disconnects for hours, than when I play a single solo que, I'm surprised if someone doesn't 
---
No the devs decided to add in fully functional perks into kill your friends for no fucking reason. 
---
With the new system I’m willing to bet nobody pipped
---
Yes it does. Ive had a survivor use it against me
---
as a survivor dont like it jump
---
as a killer dont like it hit them
---
you will earn more bloodpointa going to your next game than sitting for 10 20 min
---
I give it the TacticalWeeb48 seal of approval, the username is amazing 
---
I’m don’t have much of an issue pipping, then again I never really did 
---
I was tinkering around with m&amp;a and nurse's calling today, and it amazed me the amount of hits I got! I even managed a few gen grabs while using line of sight blockers. Rank 12 to be fair, but still. I was never this stealthy while the pig or the spirit :D
---
What would you substitute for Make Your Choice? I love the idea of this perk, but it seemed like the rescuer would go into stealth mode half the time (although this makes them less likely to heal the hooked person right by the hook, making them easy to catch again.)
---
Are her special effect trap add-ons (the sound muffling one) any good?
---
Thanks for all the great info! I never thought I'd love the hag as much as spirit, but I'm having a blast with her so far. Such an underrated killer!
---
I WISH SURVIVORS WOULD BE NICE TO ME AT LEAST SOME PERCENTAGE OF TIME INSTEAD OF EVERYONE SAY EZ AGAINST MY RANK 18 PLAGUE WITH ONE PERK AND WHITE ADDONS

One of my fourth grade teachers was a Mrs. Meyers so I misspell it like that all the damn time.

It’s the worst rank system I’ve seen in any game. 
---
moblie formatting error 
---
It's more to do with the fact that the killer was kinda rubbish so I'm not too bothered about bloodpoints
---
Because DS wasn’t at the crazy level that NOED IS AT 
---
Gens b4 friends 
---
Understandable 
---
My point is saying that insta heals are “OP” when killers got more OP shit that survivors have to deal with.. 
---
I Fuckin Called iT! Deliverstrike Is A Thing!

Also Yeah, Any Flashlight Can Pretty Much Insta-Blind Now If It Has Intense Halogen... \*sigh\*

makes more sense

I read this as plagues blowjob and I got super concerned for a second
---
Haha, its fine adds to his character a bit. Good job. I dunno if you take requests, but it would be cool if you drew Quentin and Laurie together.
---
I wait about 5 minutes before jumping or hitting I don’t wanna play a staring contest for long
---
Eliminating them is just hanging them and patroling gens and stay within a good range of that hook to punish both those gens and a potential rescue
---
[DOZENS!!!](/intensifies)

Oh OK I thought it was like something that they accidently put in with the latest patch lol

Oh those were hot as shit. 
---
M O Z A M B I Q U E  H E R E
---
Groovy 
---
Well I had it not working multiple times and it also got confirmed by MC\_Lean in his stream today.
---
When Myers killers use scratched mirror the game becomes insanely more intense. I was doing a gen in the shack by myself today and out of nowhere, Myers appears and pulls me off the gen
---
They can get as salty as they want it's not bannable lol.
---
I think it's only a matter of perspective. It's not really a strat, but on the rare occasions when 3 gens pop within 5 seconds it can be rage inducing for most people.
---
One person can't do all the hooks you walk to unless you follow them to the next hook. Bust a quick 180 and walk away and bring to another hook. If you have a group doing it then it's SWF and that's already busted in itself, can't talk about balance with comms involved when that's 3rd party. Getting good = adapting. It sounds like you'd rather whine about fairness in a game of survival than slug and chase the offender. And according to you "face camp" so you further lose on anything to gain from the game.
---
Nobody really means NOED is unfair. It's cheap and waters the game down. It's why I refuse to use it even on killers that should have it (Trapper and Freddy) for perks that help me win chases or put on map pressure. I've been a fan of Enduring, STBFL, Sloppy, Nurses, Discordance, Infectious Fright w/ Agitation, Bamboozle, and Spirits Fury.
---
Ok
---
I actually love this idea. Lol
---
How fucking dare the survivors do the objective
---
Honestly curious what your story is since I had thought about taking a whack at at least an outline for a DBD movie.  I spent a couple years co-writing a horror screenplay called Curse, which very nearly got made, but stuff fell through.  Sucks for me, but not for my co-writer, who’s already an editor in Hollywood.  😭
---
I’d argue that stakeout is better because you can just ignore Ruin as if it didn’t exist. Imo you should be aiming to hit The great skill check even with stake out stacks so you can keep them as long as possible for your mistakes.
---
Stake out is also a pseudo Spine chill in that it only counts up when you’re in terror radius range 
---
Spine chill is just great. 
---
Bold of you to assume its even on the map. 
---
I swear when i play killer its gone within 14 seconds if the game, but when im survivor the totem is literally no existant until all exit gates are powered and it gets clensed instead of NOED. 
---
Nah Mofugga U Fedora Dwight is best dwight, be a cocksucker.
---
Yeah I’m on 40 and nothing.

Hug corners. She can't vomit around them very well, and maps like Lery's and The Game are super hard for her.

Isn’t there supposed to be Double BP this weekend? I thought there was one every start of the seasons, and its now spring.

Do you watch Kittychipz? I lurk but I just saw someone with your name in the chat lol.

Ah ok! So it looks like I should get leatherface right? I mean 100% extra bloodpoints sounds amazing
---
alright and ty ;) i only use noed when its 4 flash lights. im probably gonna play legion now and have fun x3

You're welcome to read it. I used their biographies and focused in on how they arrived in the situation. However, I think its important to create characters in these situations where the audience will care whether they live or die. With Feng, her biography of being an over competitive  esports player or whatever, wouldn't work. The story connects 8 familiar characters into a game of cat and mouse with the killers

Why you gotta do warlock dirty like that?

Is that unbreakable? Where's Bill's hat?

The only actual gen rush I think exists if they got fucking BNP's. Marth88's old "depip squad" is the only actual use of gen rush that I believe exists.

PS4 doesn’t have bill so they altered his perks a little

Is this anything like my concept "The Rider" who summons a guillotine and goes YUH as part of his mori?
---
I can't really say much, than learn at your own pace.
---
But if you want genuine tips
---
\-Constantly think in the mind of a survivor to find them
---
\-Never check the closest gens to you, Yeah a survivor *May* spawn there, its not worth risking as it may waste time
---
\-Practice Back-peddling and manipulating the red stain
---
\-Know when survivors will and won't make pallets
---
\-Don't be afraid to run the scummiest perks possible to win
---
*"But thats entirely up to you lol"*
---
I'm more being literal; the millitant SWFs that just absolutely shitwreck me. Like I'll basement hook one of them end game when they descend on me with fucking flashlights and bodyblocks to make sure "no one is left behind" and then is followed up with "ezpz 2pip" chanted like a fucking mantra by all of them within milliseconds of each other.
---
I've seen this so much. Unless I'm playing by "survivor rules", I almost always have at least one disconnect per game. And I main Hag, for crying out loud.
---
It's getting out of hand. I've seen a mish-mash of excuses like "I'm not having fun", "I shouldn't have to play a match if I don't want to", "The killer is broken", "Ebony mori is OP".
---
Although I got the gem of a SWF team complaining that they can't loop *THE HAG* after a 4-man DC. I guess being able to loop the killer is the new standard for a killer being OP or unfun.
---
I don't understand your argument here, spending time around generators is bad? If you get decent at skillchecks then you won't be spending more time than usual while spending overall less time in the match.
---
Plus the killer will be checking his ruin from time to time too.
---
This makes me sad
---
This makes me very sad.
---
I’m shleeeeeep 😂😂
---
The "black whip" is only activated when a sick survivor cleanses themselves at a fountain, and then The Plague visits that fountain and "upgrades" her vomit to a lethal projectile instead of one that just makes you sick. It'll make a loud "BONG!" noise when she has the lethal vomit.
---
Don't get caught in the open. If you know her lethal power is active, be aware of your surroundings and make sure you have a place to run with higher walls that she can't get it over.
---
Also, be smart with your pallet usage - like Huntress, she can hit you over the pallet, so keep that in mind when going to throw. She might predict you're about to throw it and just spit at you over it, and you're on the ground and down one pallet.
---
How is this funny?
---
All you did was sandbag your team... Think of how pissed off you get when someone goes down 3 seconds into a chase.
---
LOL, so you Fall in to the Group of People who are so biased that they Ignore all Data to the contrary. That is Very easy to see.  
---
Prove thyself isn't the way to go, you want everyone split far away from each other &amp; working on separate generators to spread the pressure.
---
You don't want to group up, that's how you lose.
---
Wow sharp hand Joe wearing platforms?
---
Very Rare The T-Rapper Perk
---
now this is epic.
---
I agree. Very many people with Killer Bias trying to pretend like actual data is meaningless
---
I was not aware of that. I guess I assumed there would be more randomness involved.
---
Excuse me why isn't this the top post of all time on this sub. This is perfection. 
---
I play survivor killer 50/50... but the nerfs constantly to survivor has caused this. That and the rank system forcing me to play against killers that are frustrated and would rather facecamp once 2 gens ate done. 
---
I think asking that question here is going to be answered by the same douchey people that are doing those review bombs. 😂
---
Well they created a flawed ranking system and players are pretty irritated by it. I don’t found it surprising at all people are taking shots at BHVR for it.
---
It only makes sense to focus gens if the killer is camping lmao. Also genrushing is pretty common at high elo
---
To add to what the others have said, you get higher rarity items more often the higher level the bloodweb is. 
---
Dummy thicc
---
My current build is classic Lisa.
---
Monitor and Abuse and Nurses Calling is with no doubt one of the best combinations on Hag. Having a tiny terror radius (16m) and a short height means that once you see a survivor with Nurses, you have around two and a half second before they will hear your heartbeat. 
---
Make Your Choice is also a great perk for her. Hag probably fits this perk just as much as Nurse. Although at higher ranks the usefulness can diminish. 
---
Sloppy butcher is a good choice for your “slowing the game down just a lil bit” perk. Corrupt Intervention also would be a safer Ruin as you can concentrate your web around the four closest gens and potentially force the survivors into a 3 gen strat.
---
I’m gonna go against the grain and say that BBQ isn’t that great. You are too slow to take advantage of the information it gives you. Only use it for farming points. Only exception is if you are using mint rag. 
---
Addons wise? ALWAYS pick a distance addon, or stack the dried cicada and dragonfly wing. It gives you so much more freedom and increases your map control enormously.
---
The necklets are also great to reduce trap setting time. This is really useful in regards to setting traps midchase and not loosing distance.
---
Good luck in the fog fellow Hag! 
---
Idk what to tell you
---
&gt;Yep if the killer has enduring the stun is not existent. 
---
Isn't this how counters supposed to work? 
---
Recently started playing killer. Have mercy, reddit :)
---
I dont get it
---
Look at meg and nea, are they men in disguise?
---
I agree lol but I think whoever made Nea was in charge of creating Jane. 
---
Praise be 
---
I was rank 1 and now I'm rank 6 lol.
---
Nea is a Stand User confirmed . 
---
You're not fooling anyone, no one actually believes you're laughing out loud. 
---
Hooks are straight up hell to get to on that map though...
---
Have about 100 hours spread out through different killers. I still have trouble on that corn map.
---
Mate... you need to try better...
---
It's ironic I just faced a camping leatherface. You can take my upvote anyway sir
---
Last time I played you didn't depip if the killer disconnected. It'd at least give you enough points to prevent a depip.
---
I think I face-camped 9 survivors, I mean, Nobody wants to admit they face-camped 9 survivors but I did and I’m ashamed of myself, but the first camp doesn’t count, then you get the second and the third, forth and fifth I think I hit with the chainsaw and then I just kept camping.
---
Cool, one of my favorites. Love the toxicity
---
Every killer is better than Legion lol (only kinda joking)
---
When the big man with the wooden mask has someone hooked in the basement 
---
Thank you, much appreciated. I won't mind if you leave one or two of those self-activating traps either :)
---
It deserves to get review bombed. I haven't played a single game ever since the update that didn't include a disconnect and a 4 minute cue time for survivor. Fuck this game
---
You'll get this back when you've earned it.

I mean... we should just be here for a good time

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._

Lol
---
No, you are sacrificing winning the game to get one guy out of the game. It's an awful way to try to win and almost any other strategy is better than that.
---
Brave Billy, playing that map. I'm also gonna guess he had Tinkerer 
---
Come one, come all!!
---
Are you tired of surviving? Have you had enough of daddy Myers? 
---
No worries! Just come right in for your free Mori! 
---
**Limited time offer, while supplies last.**
---
I agree, but sometimes you have to run around too much to find the actual hex. I'd rather just power though ruin, because, most players will look for it first. 
---
Imagine the horror of seeing this:
---
Patch notes for 2.6.9
---
- Due to multiple complaints against the new Decisive Strike rework, we have reverted the changes prior to 2.6.0.
---
I agree. I've actually been having way more fun after not caring about rank and just playing casually. I find games much more enjoyable when I do that, and it's improved my experience with tons of games.
---
This has been every survivor game against her in one photo. Every Match I swear it has to be the same damn plague. Same tier of ruin etc. Since I'm a rank 8 I keep getting paired with potatoes who dont know how to work around ruin so they sit there instead of looking for the totem or something while I'm the only one being chased. I wish we had like a rant thread on soemthing that wasnt just on wednesdays because I'm full of salt rn
---
No, by camping one guy you aren't putting any pressure on the map as others can just do generators while you are sitting in one area.
---
Against something that counters underhanded behavior? Not really 
---
Only 38% of players actually got a character to level 25, these statistics include a lot of people who have barely played, especially since the game was free on Playstation. 
---
PS4 player here that's never experienced a crash. Not saying you're lying, but I think it's far from unstable across the board. 
---
 ty :) these are great tips especially the second on e&lt;3
---
I like the term genrush because its meaning is crystal clear, not because it's meant as a pejorative or an unfair advantage.
---
100% not a furry huh? &gt;_&gt;
---
Good. They broke their game with the rank system and constant survivor nerfs.
---
MY LEG!
---
No it's not one of the best ways at all. You focused on one guy for a significant amount of the match.
---
Everyone else is doing gens and by the time the one guy dies 3-4 gens are finished or will be by the time you get to another guy. You should be spreading the pressure around the map, hooking one guy and chasing another, so that 2 people are occupied and the other guy or two have to go for the unhook/heal the guy while you finish chasing the next target and hook them. Rinse and repeat as you wear them down so they are busy and not doing generators.
---
&gt;30, 35 and forty
---
*Eye twitches*
---
Same. She's funny as hell too
---
And it’s a goddamn Freddy
---
I think a good change for her would be to put Corrupt Purge on a consumption bar rather than a time period. In this pay off Vile Purge would be reloaded like the Clown’s bottles. This change would have to alter some of her add ons though.
---
I'll admit that that honestly kinda sucks. We always wanted Enduring to work at full strength because DS used to be Bullshit. But now, honestly, how the hell does this seem fair—countering an Anti-Tunneling perk into Nonexistence? 
---
It's nice that I have yet to actually get hit by DS, but this is problematic because being tunneled and using it against Enduring III only imposes a slight delay if even. You've still been farmed or tunneled, and it actually can't be helped. 
---
The killer could also stand to actively benefit because if I run STBFL and my Obsession dies before they die or DC, I want to reinstate the perk and start accumulating stacks. And how do I do it? *Tunneling*.
---
i had a survivor disconnect after i downed them, and then message me saying i was a “gen camper” 🤔
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Get better at chases, have better gamesense to know general spawn locations, use whispers.
---
If you do everything slowly then it's not a problem with the game that you lose games to lack of pressure.
---
Why, so other survivors can troll you with the reject button when you are trying to legitimately save them? That is not the answer.
---
BILL NYE THE ZOMBIE GUY
---
Where did I imply that I lose games or even play killer often at all? The game needs better balancing and more objectives. Simple as that.

Those implants are a tad lumpy.

You can only rely on scratch marks and environmental movement during Phase Walk.
---
when i think genrush i think 3-4 people on a gen w toolboxes. so basically swf.
---
its hard to play killer when you check 2 gens and the survivors have already knocked one off across the map in 20 seconds.
---
Same, always check for active hexes before cleansing hex totems... Cleanse all dull ones tho.
---
Killer running Noed and Haunted Ground but they survivors destroy the three dull is lovely...
---
You people need help

more like thicc mami and sick mommy

Aw-shit I didn't see that Discord overlay. Well, it's mostly a joke around our group. I am a furry, yes, but I'm no longer interested in the "porn" part of it. I WAS, but am no longer. I'm a clean furry. I think? I guess?? I don't know. You will never hear me say "OwO" or "UwU" unless I'm making a joke, I swear on that.
---
Facts
---
I like to play risky, too. I sometimes do a build without any sort of backup plan just because it's healthy for time management. In other words, I like to play this game with as much variation as possible and like to hone my skills. That's really what I like to do as Killer, is get better without necessarily winning. Basement builds. Chaser Builds. You name it. It's fun to experiment and see things work out. Don't stress over rank. Because in the end what matters is a good experience. 
---
I agree with you. This game is sadly going down the drain

Hmmm... it'll be some labor costs. I'll get you an estimate

I love to play legion, but I dread going against as franks and stab wound legion. Because that’s always a possibility I don’t judge people that dc but staying in the game to then bm the killer is a bit far. Don’t like the killer you’re against? DC, it’s not that hard and you won’t have to suffer 
---
Coldwind Farm 101
---
MA BOYE DWIT
---
Yep. Freddy's also the only killer you can play in broad daylight lol
---
NOED is a counter to gen rushing. Change my mind
---
I think we'll probably get him as a stand alone survivor, although a deadite killer and a map with an old abandoned cabin would be really cool.... that is, if the leak didn't ruin it for everyone and it gets cancelled 
---
I think this is a tiny bit much, but it's both perks working. The survivor still got off the killer's shoulder. The killer just happened to have a perk that reduces stuns... against a perk that includes a stun. Both perks are working as intended. 
---
I noted the second part when I saw the DS change. Ironically, in trying to prevent tunneling, the devs made a perk that, with the right perks and conditions, made killers *want* to tunnel and ***actually*** ***want to get hit by DS***. Outside of actually wanting to get hit by DS, an opponent should not ever want to run into something that is meant to be a deterrent/downside to them. 
---
It shows who plays swf and who solos lel
---
Plus WGLF hoooooooo boy
---
Sadistic Intention: Needs to be until they get on the hook, or that's an Instant DC from me; Not only does the Killer know exactly who to tunnel first, but they're heavily encouraged to do so.
---
Hex: False Start: Does each Survivor get the regression check, or is it one survivor has to land a check that could take it back 75% of the way? Also, should only work once per generator.
---
Hex: No Way Out: How long does this last for? Because typically the hatch is the last hope for the survivor to escape.
---
That's the way she goes, bud
---
I don't fancy myself a masochist, buuuut...
---
Save the Best For Last. 
---
I hate using her power while going up/down stairs, it seems to fuck up the trajectory a lot.
---
Hey, you wanna tell your buddies which way I went after I hook you? Good luck with that, lmao. 
---
Just no.
---
Same here. Snitches get stitches.
---
Huntress hatchets are pretty much bullshit. They had them fixed at one point, but reverted them after what I assume was a mountain of bitching by Huntress mains.
---
No killer would ever take that hatch one off, that's way too strong lol. That and survivors would just hide for hours if they're the last one alive and theres 1+ gens left. There would be no chance for them and that is shit.
---
Nah she cute
---
Huh???
---
damn, you should be banned.
---
But I agree that the System is insanely stupid 
---
How to get hatch--Make loud noise far away from it by either running, throwing down a pallet, or a gen explosion. If they don't come to the hatch, continue gens. If they aren't stupid, they'll eventually come looking for you. Be sneaky and go around the perimeter (Most killers don't bother checking the very corners of the map behind every wall) to get to the hatch.
---
Currupt intervention if anything helps the survivors avoid a 3 gen :(
---
He started playing again now with me lol but hadn't checked his dailies
---
damn, isnt Ace twice as old?
---
He has a pretty big terror radius in tier 3, monitor or no monitor.
---
"the land of spider god murder playground"
---
I'm going to be stealing this, thanks!
---
Wow. It’s 2019, dude.
---
Mmm, I completely agree, and it's such a great feeling. Now killers, their obsession perks, and good old STBFL are actually a threat and the power is back in the killer's hands. No more worrying about 3 or 4 DS's in a match, no more 35% stabs as I'm going to a hook, no more going down to 2 stacks from 8 just because my obsession decided they didn't want to go on a hook just yet and DS'd me.... It's so good. 
---
This is actually one of the greatest things I’ve seen in this sub
---
Ace is a gamblin man, and that right there is one hell of a gamble. 
---
K den.
---
This is all great stuff. Thank you! 
---
So hatch spawns into the map when 1 survivor has died and 4 gens completed I believe, so that's when the totem would light up. When the hatch spawns into the map.
---
Unless it's a hatch game where 3 gens are left and only one survivor is left, then the totem would light up
---
"Significant amount of the match" - I never said I take a significant part of the match. You seem to think I mean "camp the fuck out of them".  
---
But if I know someone is weak and bad, I \*can\* focus them every time I find a group of survivors, going for the weak link and going for someone who was already hooked once or is on their last hook is smart, kill rushing. It's just like when you come back to an unhook (pre-DS rework) and the injured and the obsession are running away. Always smarter and better to go for the injured one and ignore the obsession who was almost certainly pre-nerf DS. But then survivors get mad at you for "tunneling".  Which I understand but hey, it's doing the objective. The moment you reduce the survivor team to 3, you have made huge progress towards a win. And that's my objective, to win. Not give survivors a "great game". 
---
They never "give me a great game" when they're winning and I wouldn't expect them to. 
---
Games without Ruin can end in 4 minutes. You can tell yourself that gen rushing doesn't exist but the truth is that efficient survivors can end the game before it has even begun.
---
I don't blame survivors for focusing on the objective, I blame the devs for not balancing the game around good survivors and just leaving Ruin unchanged as a band-aid fix.
---
IIRC, the devs said everyone is at least 21 years old. 
---
Just don't be mad when you didn't cleanse all the totems and get hit with NOED.
---
Gen rushing is basically a term for “exclusively doing the main objective extremely fast”. No looting chests, no cleansing dulls, no following the killer around to flashlight save, no goofin around, just straight smashing that m1 button on gens.
---
I think a lot pf survivors actually don’t enjoy it that much. Plenty of people like goofin around.
---
It would fit well as long as NOED stays the way it does, cleanse them dull totems and you would have nothing to worry about 
---
Why are you guys like this
---
Why would a killer run ruin with corrupt intervention? Three gens get locked so survivors will be running around looking for another gen and will most likely run across your hex totem.
---
Not saying you are. I'm saying that ~~thanks to the new garbage matchmaker~~ a lot of people are simply quitting instead of learning how to play against Plague and are calling her OP as a result.
---
No this is Patrick.
---
Muh 4k 
---
Pretty fun just wish they would tone down the whispering with the corruption. Feels like I have schizophrenia
---
I used blender
---
That's how it often goes. Playing killer is just as frustrating with this new system. Tired of being a rank 10 and getting rank 1s that are just low rank bc of this shit. Makes me want to uninstall.
---
Yikes transphobic shit posts.
---
&gt;again
---
We didn't talk to each other before?
---
&gt;if they choose that then finish the gens and leave. 
---
I wasn't arguing about game balance? I just said that face camping is a thing, that it's an awful strategy to use as it's not effective at winning. The guy getting face camped is still getting face camped, so face camping is a thing.
---
I'm believing it actually, so that's a person right there.
---
Disproved you with data.
---
We acknowledge its pretty high but we would like to see how it plays out, basically it would probably still be faster than powering through a ruin gene. Also it would only happen once per gen
---
I find the killer kind of annoying to play against tbh but definitely better than Legipn 
---
Thank you again u/ZombieHuggerr!
---
More like stop disconnecting on purpose and play the fucking game the right way. 
---
I mean Tru u could but to be fair it's rare to see survivors get all 5 gens and live. And if they get the hatch they are very lucky. I'm not saying I have a problem with Ruin, but I DO have a problem with getting a killer with it EVERY GAME. 
---
Yup exactly, would work just like noed, if no dull totems are available then the hex wont work
---
No you did not give any data confirming that killers downvote someone if they don't join them in their "woe is me" efforts, don't try to twist things just because you have no evidence.
---
Muh free escape
---
But that's not camping, that's tunneling. You are focusing one guy.
---
Camping is staying around the area of the hooked person, hoping that someone comes around for the unhook so that you can down them.
---
I mean, yeah you are winning, and if all you care about is getting the game over as fast as possible then that's good for you. Some people might just find it boring.

Yeah, so if I get a full SWF team with 2k hour survivors you strategy doesn't work. You cannot prevent a good team from genrushing if you don't play a killer that can pressure by ending chases quickly.
---
That's all there is to it.
---
To an extent. Remember, Ruin's still meta and likely will be for a long time coming. 
---
Ah, I see. Nice to meet you! And thanks for pointing that out, I'll be more mindful of the Discord Overlay from now on when I take screenshots I intend to share. Thankfully this wasn't a serious case, but someone could discover me or one of my friend's real names. (Granted I personally do not care purely because my Steam profile uses my real name but that's besides the point).
---
Prepare your body for the hate

No need to change your mind, Ace, I agree.

Oh nooooo pls

its actually about 70% of the time that all 5 gens get done after the stats the devs released, but you can also just work through ruin
---
Well yeah but to beef up your main, it takes no time. 
---
Yeah, Ruin, but I was talking about in regards to the obsession mechanic. 
---
Yellow apron + tie

Here’s the [link](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/rx4elRs)

Just made the idea for fun, thank you for the useless input. 
---
I got it once as killer.
---
You mean red?
---
Jfc
---
Small game to get that ruin so your pubs aren’t scared to do gens, perhaps?
---
Well they’ve already been messing up the balance quite a bit 
---
My input: it literally looks the you mashed the spirit and bing bong boi together. 
---
Killers are arguably stronger than survivors now, I’m hoping they don’t whine until bhvr nerfs mettle of man into the ground
---
Think of all the killer synergies. Like make it 3 exit doors, 10 gens required out of like 16, then have trapper hag, or huntress clown, maybe wraith pig, that would be so cool! 
---
I close my eyes and seize it
---
I clench my fist and beat it
---
I grab my Dwight and hook it
---
I am The Entity I worship
---
killer should have been billiy boi
---
I dont just mean with survivor I enjoy killer way more because I like killing more then fleeing but just ooo it's frustrating 
---
H E X  D E T E C H E D
---
God damn Sharp hand Josephine 😂😂😂
---
Again BHVR listens to killer bitching what can you do?
---
One thing might be that a new DLC just dropped, so good players who maybe dropped the game because they got bored with it or whatever decided to come back.
---
Also, DS got the shit nerfed out of it. So survivors are probably speeding through gens now that they've got their safety net taken away from them.
---
You sound like me when I get placed against a teabagging swf.
---
A large Shirtless Myers
---
Coven of Ardetha unite! 
---
I think that in general the games are faster.  I don’t seem to have those 15-20 minute matches anymore.  I think it’s due to killer being more efficient.  I notice that pretty early on a survivor gets hit.  Unusually early.  Only time this didn’t happen last night was when I was playing a very inexperienced nurse.  People are also learning to slam out generators instead of healing I’ve noticed too and believe it’s because they have learned to do this do to playing legion multiple times.  The games are faster and pipping isn’t always simple.
---
Just because she has a spine on her weapon doesn't mean they are the same😂 
---
By your logic then Billy and bubba are the same 
---
Same weapons for both chainsaw and hammer
---
You know, if you don't like the art I make for fun, you can make your own
---
*cough I think you mean thrill of the hunt cough*
---
*looks at her flashlight being insidious camped by a leatherface*
---
Nevermind I agree with you now lol
---
I’m a rank 12 survivor &amp; my games have also been unusually quick, but in the opposite direction. Every team I’ve been in gets demolished unusually fast now.
---
How?
---
You know women are just capable of having faces outside of the standard round face, small chin, button nose ones right?
---
Nobody cares about you. Not your mother, not your father. Nobody in the world.
---
4K to even think of pipping.  Since the release it seemed they back off of it being as hard but I still find that as a survivor if you dc, it doesn’t matter what the killer does, they will black pip.  So essentially survivors can control a killers rank Just by dcing
---
I got a pink addon for Clown at 25.
---
Tbh I hit the ruin skills check like 80% it's my neanderthal teammates that run around the map for 5 minutes and won't touch a damn gen with a 10 foot pole until ruin is cleansed.
---
That's what I worry about.
---
*laughs in 25mps*
---
happy microphone day!
---
IT’S NOT MY FAULT, IT’S EVERYONE ELSES
---
I like to cleanse 4 totems find the last one and do the last gen that way if they have NOED I get 400 extra points I also either die or get to save a teammate who went down 5 seconds after the last gen is done
---
Thanks for checking it out. 
---
OOF. I meant thrill of the hunt. (They look way too similar)
---
Yeah. I’m a rank 15 killer right now (I’ve been red rank but I stopped playing killer for a bit), and I got a 3k earlier with the last one getting a hatch escape. Safety pipped.
---
Where’s nea?
---
that warpstorm looks nasty
---
Instead of giving more pallets I'd rather they find other ways to give survivors a chance. I tend to sigh when I see a pallet because it's just gonna be a loop or the survivor failing to pull it down right, so not exciting at all really.
---
I just want a bit more variance honestly. Picking splinters out of my teeth gets boring. 
---
I don’t play MM without M&amp;A
---
TBH I have been (at my highest) rank 5 and MYC is still useful. MYC has NOT worn out its usefulness at rank 12 for sure!
---
There is a great discord server if you have it called The Haggers Den. Its a community of Hag mains that I have learnt a lot from. 
---
Another great perk for Hag is STBFL. Sure, you have an obsession but the weapon wipe is RIDICULOUSLY quick which is good for a slow killer. 
---
Enduring can be good if you are an aggressive type of Hag, good perk in general because swinging through pallets is something all killers should do. 
---
Agitation is a good perk as well. You can waste a lot of time getting to a hook due to 110% movement speed.
---
Remember Me / Bloodwarden for endgame.
---
Rancor gives you information for where survivors are and the mori at the end is a bonus.
---
Frankelins Demise is also great for dealing with Flashlights. They have to set off traps that you put on the items :3. 
---
I know you said Hexes are out but Hex: Haunted Grounds is beautiful thing on Hag... YOU THOUGHT IT WAS DEVOUR SOAP!
---
Muffling sound addon? Completely useless really... If you want no terror radius for periods use Dark Devotion. 
---
Addons which show aura for a few seconds can also be good. I personally just like wacking down traps and having a large teleport range. Great thing with Hag is that there are many builds and playstyles that you can employ. Mix and match and have fun!
---
I reccomend the youtube channel Space Coconut for a great guide on the Hag as well as his videos in general. 
---
I did this at rank 2 just a few games ago (not bragging, I only mention rank because the asinine requirements there are in the red ranks to get pips), and I swear, I felt my pants get a little warm. 
---
Yeah, I understand that sentiment. My personal nemesis is Myers, and getting games where you don’t hear a heartbeat and there aren’t any jigsaw boxes one after another really wears my patience thin. 
---
Actually best advice for killers I’ve ever heard. I’ll change the way I play, as I tend to get bogged down in long chases
---
I’ve never lost so many frames in my life! Ps4 pro on boost mode = 0 effect to whatever the fuck happened lmao 
---
Would definitely be down for this so long as everything else in the game gets fixed first.
---
WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
---
Which is why I relentlessly tunnel and slug so they can't genrush me. EZ.
---
I can't even listen to music and play killer and that's what keeps me calm usually music but this damn game man. Its so infuriating but I play it because I know deep down behind all the anger and hate I like the game and what they are doing 
---
The "dbd mobile game" Identity V has this implemented. It works pretty well and I could see it working here. Also, the two creators worked together on Identity V so I can't see any copyright going around. 
---
They said 18 but in the Legions bio 3 of them are still in highschool so probs 17 or 16 but they have to say 18 most likely for legal matters.
---
They're making it even MORE grindy than it already is. FFFFFFFFU
---
Sure, it was more of a "hey survivors, I'm not asking for longer gens without some kind of compensation for you" throwaway comment.
---
But yes, more variance and a little longer on average game times. So far, I don't think BHVR has found the answer.
---
Props
---
as someone whos visually impaired this one hit a bit Too Close to Home
---
God, I would've pissed myself
---
Why do people keep downvoting this I dont understand.
---
It means more than a min you’re reading it wrong 
---
^(nah that's nea)
---
I noticed that too. I was wondering if survivors could hear that or just me. Spirit is useless right now with these bugs.
---
Me too, especially how they angrily slam the empty locker shut and turn around. But the trapper one really had me laughing, I was the only one not dead or on a hook...and he still looked in the damn locker.
---
Cause I think one of the purpose of daily rituals is to get you out of your said comfort zone and try out something new ( I guess) 
---
I would agree with you that pandering is stupid when it's forced. Jane is like our first kinda big survivor though so I wouldn't call that pandering.
---
Overall with how many survivors and killers for that matter that we've gotten it makes sense to finally get a kinda chubby girl. She is big too, not just "THICC" as people are saying which nothing is wrong with.
---
I personally like that since Clown/Kate the characters have been a bit more expressive and kinda wish they would go back and redo all previous characters to have more unique physics and animations so it doesn't feel like we basically have Male model and female model for survivors and that all the other killers don't just have expressionless faces all the time.
---
With the old ranking system I would've still ranked up for killing all 4 Survivors before the gates were open.
---
Indeed. They meet every Tuesday to scour the dark web using extremely unreliable internet. Tim brings the Krispy Kreme and Pam’s in charge of the Starbucks. 
---
Haha, the horrible thing is, is that there’s genuinely people with this trail of thought who post on this sub. 
---
Exactly.   I get tunneled and facecamped a lot, Dstrike is so good for how I wind up having to play.  
---
Absolutely and I think that would work. 
---
This script is my attempt to provide the same experience we DBD players feel for non gamers- a high octane experience of who’s going to survive. I guess I wanted the essence to be the collective experience of the game. 
---
Lucky.
---
they still Spawn in plain sight and on gens
---
I've had this happen once. I walked away with something like 220k BP (thank you BBQ and 2x BP)
---
Then call it "focusing."   DStrike is a blessing now against killers that don't know there are 3 other survivors in a match.  
---
Looks like nobody in your game did LOL
---
Gotta keep the Ghostface love alive so they don't forget
---
Or just don't jump out during the tantrum.
---
It's extremely rare that you are going to get the swf team you mentioned.  4 loop gods is an anomaly.  Typically 2 of them are likely to be weaker in chases.  I'm telling you that if you pressure pressure non stop and use chases you cannot end quickly to simply eliminate a quick pallet and abandon chase hit and run style, eventually you wittle down their defenses and it becomes quite easy to down even the good ones near the end.  It isn't instant gratification and requires some patience and setup but it's your best option to beat the sweaty swf groups.  I pay no mind to the first 2 gens.  I don't care how fast they pop.  The game ends up slowing down considerably once you're down to the gens you care about and at that point since those have been your focus you'd have eliminated the defenses around these final gens making the eventual 3 gen strat a strong one.  Again I'm doing it myself with what's considered to be the weakest killers in the game so it doesn't require you to sweat with Nurse or Billy every game.
---
That’s *some serious dedication.
---
i like it, i can actually find games quicker with my friends. Before the change we would regularly sit in the lobby for more than 5 minutes waiting.
---
They could all be seniors. 
---
At least it was Kate and not Quentin. *shudders*
---
Yes please. Give me killers and survivors that aren’t my rank, I will have fun regardless but please do not give me 200+ ping. 
---
But that could've been said about Decisive too. Can't catch a survivor or two after being stunned get over it or u don't deserve to rank up. And like I said in another comment, I DONT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HEX RUIN. I'm just tired of getting it EVERY GAME. geez. 
---
Tunneling isn't even a thing, it's called killing the survivors one by one. Change my mind.
---
Yet you are probably one of those same whiny bitches crying about NOED.
---
Guess what? We just doing the objective too, bitch 
---
The killer got everyone within a few minutes... it’s almost like it’s balanced 
---
Her weapon is a whip, the spinal cord is more just a visual aesthetic 
---
&gt;survivors pop gens ASAP and only run the main building whilst the killer proceeds to facecamp.
---
The killer is an AI and they must play exactly how survivors want them to /s
---
Bye, see you tomorrow
---
Oh boy Haha I'm actually a killer main, and I just posted one as bout noed not being overpowered.
---
I fucking wish I could get games like that
---
True but the way that they are described it makes it sound like they are either seniors and 17 or juniors and 16 or 17
---
I'd love a Scream chapter, and while I don't think MTV Ghostface cosmetics would sell, I'd still like them in the game. 
---
I JUST DID THAT AS TRAPPER AND DIDN'T GET THE TROPHY. ARE THEY ALL BUGGED NOW?
---
I posted my first comment before your comment, sorry. 
---
I personally feel like the Plague is more similar to Huntress simply because they both have projectiles that injure. 
---
They do both have annoying abilities that require a certain action but I feel like that's as far as it goes. Saying they both make vaulting/pallets unsafer doesn't exactly help when comparing the two since many killers already exert this pressure. Huntress can hit you by throwing a hatchet, Nurse and Hag can teleport, Myers gets more time to stalk, Trapper can put traps in the best pallet and vaulting spots, Spirit can play some serious mind games at pallets by making you wonder whether she's using her power, ECT.
---
Also, I can't think of a single killer ability that isn't annoying. 
---
To wrap it up, yes they have similarities, but that's inevitable with so many killers and abilities. The thing is they have different intended playstyles. Legion is meant to be able to chain attacks quickly that do less damage and have little cool down. Plague is meant to pressure survivors into choosing between being broken the whole match or giving the Plague access to Corrupt Purge but being at full health imo.
---
We're all going to have different opinions but I feel claiming they're reusing abilities/ideas is a little extreme. Thanks for sharing your opinion tho.
---
Dont respect pallets
---
Strafe corners instead of holding W
---
Learn how and WHEN to moonwalk tiles (this is so fucking important, but so many killers do it at tiles where it literally can't work.)
---
Don't tunnel 1 sirv at a time, you will lose if you don't pressure everyone.
---
I would need to see proof for that. I have tons of game footage where I didn’t double pip because someone suicided/last survivor died instantly on hook.
---
ya i mean shes playable but bad rn. 
---
Take off infectious fright for enduring and ruin for sloppy
---
Take of noed for whispers or BBQ.
---
*Riiiight*
---
Use Head On &gt;:)
---
I wish there was a pop up of a message from them being salty. 
---
Hex names are just a common name and I guess she thinks they belong to a guild or something,
---
Works only after 3 seconds spent in the locker :c
---
Very true
---
lil murderer got what she deserved!
---
Any links to leaked Outfits?
---
Oof. Um, use your Claudette teleporting powers then.
---
Apex player I see :)
---
Seeing monk made me think, why haven't they made a killer that takes down survivors with a punch to the head
---
They don't want to split the community because then there will never be games to be found
---
Still, kinda sucks, great game but this has really began to turn me off of it.
---
Shhhhh.... The first rule of Hex Guild is that you don't talk about Hex Guild. 
---
Slug them ✌️ slug them ✌️
---
Does anyone know if this is still bugged? Trying to get all my Adepts to 100% again and this bug is pretty irritating. Yet somehow I’m not surprised something this massive got by BHVR.
---
I am 100% certain you either didn’t check the ping, or the ping spiked
---
I thought it fit because of the clown’s perk. 
---
I actually dislike Mirage with a passion. Lmao. 
---
I mean.. your emblems are pretty bad. How do you get silver devout? 3 sacs is 6 points. Did you let one bleed out?
---
You need 2 iridescent medals and 2 golds to rank up in ranks 1-4. 
---
What the fuck were they thinking?
---
The new survivor meta seems to be gens at all costs, no healing, adrenaline at the end. I've swapped Ruin for Thanatophobia on Billy. It seems to at least provoke the survivors into getting off the gens to heal. 
---
I really don't get why they made ranking as it is. I've been ranked with people that are rank 10-15 and haven't even seen a single red today. It's pretty much a joke at this point.
---
If you do gens really fast when killer is camping that's gen rushing
---
If they do gens really fast because you were busy chasing the same survivor all game that's doing the objective and killer is doing something wrong
---
If survivors let people die when killer isn't camping it's survivors doing something wrong
---
M1 only Leatherfaces be like
---
¿
---
No wonder no one likes you
---
I don't get it. I really don't. 
---
I haven't seen a single red survivor at all after the first day of the new patch. The best I've seen is purple survivors, along with some greens.
---
I also had an entire lobby of people that were grey. Like, what the hell?
---
Getting camped is on survivors 90% of the time as they got downed
---
Loll accurate
---
Easiest way to deal with them i find is camp the hook. I always see some 900IQ play to try to rescue the victim when its swf.
---
Except survivors physically can't lag switch because Killers host the game.
---
The same people who agree with this are the same people who think NOED is OP lmao
---
Needs more protein 
---
It has to be a internet/PC issue because on my ps4 I rarely have trouble finding matches with good ping
---
Do you have Megface yet?
---
I require a picture of whatever cutie patootie lives inside that terrarium.
---
This strategy is unknown to too many people that it actually hurts real bad. Why the fuck does someone get unhooked so early 😐
---
We need to survive. It's a team game. If you are selfish, stop playing this game. You are just spoiling it for others.
---
This will get you demolished by most (decent) swf. Most times, they’re coordinating which gens to do aka which ones aren’t near the killer, and will wait until the last second for an unhook or a chase with another person. It’s almost best to really dole out damage to multiple survivors.  Like tag one and break chase when you see another. Don’t get tunnel vision on one guy. 
---
I really doubt it, I can look for 15 minutes and eventually find a lobby with decent ping, it just seems that matches aren't being filtered at all based on ping, and that I'm being put in games no matter how high or low the ping is, and it's basically a dice roll whether I get decent ping or not.
---
That cant be real 45000 bp lmaooo
---
*survs have WGLF and killer BBQ*
---
How about a little more? 
---
Found the killer main. This is not killer vs survivor debate. If you want to post a valid argument, then do so instead of writing shit!
---
They probably just used the same house-sized hitboxes they use for Huntress hatchets. We wouldn't want Killers to have to actually aim.
---
Well my internet is better than most so I dont really have issues ever. Its usually only at high rank it gets difficult but that's due to the amount of people at that rank not really the match making itself. Supply and demand my dude
---
That’s not a half bad idea, but I feel like Ruin might be more important than ever. Even if they all hit greats (which they won’t all the time), it’s still better than not having it. 
---
Freaking A + Wraith cosplay, how did you even do that? 
---
I never bothered to unlock DS but now I actually want to use it. Just last night I got relentlessly tunneled by a spirit using rancor (I was the lucky obsession) and that just made no sense to me. Why tunnel and hook me 3 times when you can just down me once and mori me? Wtf? 
---
Shhhh it’s an inside joke
---
Who tf are you to tell someone to stop playing a game? Lmao
---
You haven’t even seen r/deathgarden
---
Works for me 
---
NEW MAP: THE RANCH
---
Still, 24 metres when he has instadowns is terrifying
---
Been trying that, but it's hard not to pursue a target that's one more hit until death... The issue is coordination, people will almost always outplay anyone but a nurse when it comes to that, and I hate playing Nurse, it's so sweaty .
---
"You're ugly. You're disgusting. I'm gonna kill you"
---
Fully in support of the rework, but:
---
They really need to give Decisive an uncountered stun duration of at least 3 seconds. Imho, it should be a normal gen skill check, and if you hit great, it should be 6 seconds; or you should just press a button on pick-up for a guaranteed 3 second stun.
---
It punishes tunneling, now, so why make it possible to shrug it? Enduring is heavily ingrained in the meta, they should have accounted for this one.
---
This seems to be very specific to the new killer. I just had two games in a row where I encountered this issue both with the new killer and my last game against a Billy where this did not happen.
---
I would love to know if anyone else has encountered this bug? It's truly game breaking for me as whenever I turn the "wiggle" animation would begin except I'm not actually in the killers grasp as it stops my survivor in her tracks. Very frustrating 
---
I keep seeing these and thought people were joking around but with the actual picture damn, it is real
---
Presumptive of you to assume they knew what a killer was
---
This urks me a little bit because it only got reworked cause the KILLERS who complained about it werent good enough to re-catch the survivor that used it on em. Apparently it "made games too slow" even tho that's basically what 95% of killer perks do lmao. 
---
I am stealing this
---
How did he do?
---
So what would her ability be?

at least legions power doesn't give you a insta heal 😂
---
Poor killer their BM cost them a kill
---
Hey, this guy slays zombies too. Huh. 
---
Too damn funny! 
---
lol she hit you so you basicly times that PERFECTLY
---
I love innocently doing gens and not having Spine Chill go off for a long time... too long... then you turn the camera slightly... squint your eyes and BAM! 
---
Meg's doing a dull totem.
---
Yes, so bhvr made it so no one can get to rank 1. That was the whole point of the meme
---
Crawl a bit away from it when they hit you.
---
Tenacity is actually a really good pairing with it, it'll get you just far enough, and if they somehow respect it, you can get help easier.
---
Then they'd all dc cause they got downed after tbagging the first pallet they drop 
---
Have your opinion my friend, but Kate is best girl
---
it's an 18+ game, just sayin...
---
play a game of marbles with diversion
---
And you genrushing makes the killer useless because the gens get done in 20 seconds.
---
I'm getting PTSD from image
---
I have almost 600 hours into this game and no matter the place, Tiers 1 Myers always scares me.
---
Whenever I start the match and I don't know who the killer is, I always look everywhere when I'm doing a gen to expect Myers.
---
Or a damn sneaky piggy
---
Yes, and that is grossly oversimplified as they really mean taking the game hostage via bodyblocking, such as a survivor trapping another survivor or the killer trapping a survivor for an extended period of time. A survivor cannot take a game hostage by bodyblocking, the killer can simply hit them. I showed the link to the official set of bannable offenses, and it clearly states bodyblocking by itself IS NOT bannable.
---
For you, thats fine. She's not my type in the slightest. Too blonde for my taste. Nothing wrong with how she looks, but Jane is much more up my alley in every way.
---
The rank reset man 😂. It's always the rank reset.
---
*laughing Bubba your Entity is amazing.
---
It seems we have reached an understanding, have a nice day
---
All the legions would just get one hit killed 
---
A rare thing for reddit, indeed!
---
Stakeout gamers rise up
---
What?
---
Huntress would probably win, but killers that can get close quickly like Spirit or Nurse would stand a chance.
---
Nurses calling, monitor and abuse, sloppy butcher and bbq&amp;chili 
---
HAD A BAD START AND WAS PLAYING MYERS ON THOMPSONS, HAD A COUPLE HOOKS HERE AND THERE BUT GOT SMASHED ON GENS. I MANAGED TO HOOK ONE FAR FROM EXIT GATE AND TIER 3 ANOTHER AND HOOKED HIM CLOSE. JUGGLED BETWEEN SURVIVOURS PERFECTLY AND STALK. ENDED UP HAVING 2 DEAD AND CUT OFF THE LAST ONE TO GET STALK THEN DOWNED THEM AND GOT THE TIER 3 KILL INCHES BEFORE THE LAST ESCAPED. ALL THAT TO DE RANK. I PRETTY MUCH PLAYED THE MATCH PERFECT FOR THE END GAME AND LOST BECAUSE OF IT. THERE WAS NO CAMPING EVEN THOUGH THE EXIT GATES WERE OPEN I RISKED LEAVING HOOKS ON HUNCHES THAT I KNEW WHERE THEY WERE. QUIT THE GAME AFTER AND WONT BE COMING BACK TILL THESE DEVS POOL TOGETHER 10 IQ BETWEEN THEM. IT ACC BAFFLES ME HOW DISCONNECTED THEY ARE FROM THEIR OWN GAME. 
---
Fuck I hope so!
---
It's bad for us Killers too. Gatekeeper got buffed, but that's out of our control because it's always so dependent on whether or you guys actually give a shit about doing gens. Devout is now nearly impossible to get Iridescent on, as it now requires no less than 9 hook scores. The 4k is only enough for a gold. Malicious is okay, but the penalty for successful heals is worse. 
---
And now on to the really bad one--Chaser. It used to be bad, and now it's worse. It basically rewards us for short chases (meaning downing you quickly) and punishes camping. The last part is actually excruciating, because some killers' playstyles thrive on being able to effectively defend hooked Survivors. As a Trapper main, for example, I have to head out to gather my defenses and spend time placing them around the hook before I can leave, because I don't want unhooks. This is actually a very effective strategy but I'm usually punished for it so badly that I'm lucky to get above silver. 
---
So long story short, it's stupid in general. 
---
Problem with NOED is that it's really hit or miss. If you have any other hex totem active, *everyone* will just assume you've got more and cleanse every totem, dull or not, that they come across. There are opportunities where NOED is in an impossibly difficult place to find once active, like the boiler room on Bedham, but it's unlikely and seldom does it even result in more than 1 kill. 
---
I don't even know how to moonwalk with Legion if I'm honest. Unless I'm mind-gaming mid chase when not in FF
---
Ironically Freddy is probably the most powerful. 
---
I MADE AN OOOSIE AAAAAAAAAAAA
---
It then NEEDS to be removed from the reportable options which leads to a BAN if it’s not BANNABLE is all I’m saying. 
---
Facecamp isn't even a thing, it's called "Survivor fishing" and "Early Christmas" CHANGE MY MIND
---
Do you think there is 1 person who really cares about that? And also it’s not like DBD is scary. The only scary thing in the game is jumpscare Myers.
---
If this isn't your average Billy game play I don't know what is!
---
Bruh
---
Why is a four year old playing this? 
---
Nah I'm just yanking your chain- play whatever you want as a kid. Play God of War or some shit, and we're not talking sterline 2018 God of War where blood is really just lava, and the only decapitation is shown offscreen. No, we're talking balls to the wall God of Gore from 2005 mofos.
---
I don't know what I'm talking about. I need sleep. 
---
That would be quite cool as well, basically the same concept just more realistic.
---
Very alive and well to me. You should just ... quit playing? 
---
Rin is best girl.
---
Imagine failing to get this as Wraith.

That first perk is begging people to hide in a locker or the basement for 2 minutes lol.

Why the hell would anyone do that first of all, and second you could just make it a visual cue that they are rejecting or accepting. Next time just try to think about it before trying to hate on my perfectly good idea, thanks!
---
Iron maiden and Deerstalker are garbage on Legion. I don't know why they think that's toxic. A real toxic build would be Stridor, Bloodhound, M&amp;A, Sloppy Butcher. 
---
I'm playing fine with killer in high ranks and I get matched with other rank 1-3 survs. Maybe sometimes I'll come across a rank 5 surv
---
I had to get chased for 2 seconds as meg for 30k BP.
---
This is an amazing cosplay, I'm a huge fan of the original texas chainsaw massacre, and this makes me so happy. You did a great job ❤️
---
That's why you wait out the tantrum as well. 
---
CROUCH BEHIND A GENERATOR AND DON'T WORK ON IT, YOUR AURA IS HIDDEN BEHIND IT. SOURCE: KILLER MAIN WHO THOUGHT BBQ WAS FUCKING BUGGED UNTIL A FRIEND TOLD ME WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
---
Id rather have killers with interesting new powers than the same chase, left click spam things we already have lots of
---
This is honestly funny. I agree with OP but that salt is delicious. 
---
legion good
---
Yeah, it would slow the game down just a little bit longer at the beginning, unless the obsession literally doesn't give a shit lol. And I know, I'd be mad too if we all missed the skill check and had to do the gen over again, but honestly, 4 survivors never get to do a gen together. It's mostly just 2 survivors teaming up or maybe 3. But it gives an incentive to cleanse totems and not just gen rush and escape
---
Was literally thinking the same thing. 
---
That's a little edgy and unnecessary, is it not? 
---
Disclaimer: I don't even own the mofo.
---
And why is that? Does it play off his ability really well? 
---
Bloodhound.
---
#6 just answers SO many questions for me. I've been dealing with this almost every game with the new killer!! THANK YOU
---
Freddy? 
---
Ain't that the fucking truth. 
---
Dark Devotion Myers is pretty sick.
---
I actually experienced this 2 days ago, i was wondering why the killer was so sweaty and later at the scoreboard, the killer was ranked 2
---
It's a thing, and it sucks as a Killer, but that doesn't mean it's wrong.
---
sooo, slow down the games main objective / doing something while chasing a surv or finding a surv.
---
Idk man those feel more important than survs secondary actions
---
If we're talking game rules, she can attack Freddy before he can touch her. Freddy can get slammed by a pallet thrown by a survivor that's awake, after all. If it's movie rules, then definitely Freddy can win. Can't really argue against movie-rules Freddy.
---
Slenderman? Is that you?
---
Ha I feel like I just got rick rolled, kindly take my upvote sir
---
They just need to get good
---
&gt; Hate to break it to you, but I play as Killer 4-1, and your point is coming off as a sad song on a small violin.
---
I have almost 4000 hours in this game. I find it highly unlikely that any serious killer in the red ranks who has dealt with DS since it's inception would be ok with a killer perk being nerfed to suit the most rage-inducing survivor perk for the past two years.
---
&gt; Most Killers run Enduring. It's borderline basic kit, and has been since release. You don't have to respect pallets with it. In the state that DS is now in, it's a fair perk that exists to give tunneled people a second chance.
---
There were several perks and several strategies to avoid tunneling already. DS is just the latest. And I got news for you - it's not going to deter tunneling if the killer has become angered by any survivor's t-bagging/trolling behavior. He's going to chase you regardless of your perks, down you, and kill you. 
---
A base mechanic that deters tunneling from campers? I'm all for and that is what should be considered. Enduring being nerfed to suit DS? No. DS being uncountable by any killer perks? Hell to the No. Both of these should not be considered and will not fix a killer who is bent on tunneling.
---
&gt; If you'd like to avoid it, down the injured guy, and hook him immediately if you're next to a hook.
---
The only way to avoid the reworked DS is to slug and patrol around the person for 60 seconds which is a complete time waster and will probably lead to a loss of rank with the re-worked rank system, or to not engage in a chase at all even if you have hooked another person before returning and even if the unhooked person runs right in front of you within the 60 seconds. It's the devs attempt to force killers to play the least optimal way possible on the possibility that the person may have DS. It derails the snowball effect, and prolongs the game unnecessarily. Just to suit a crutch perk.
---
&gt; You could down him, and then chase after the healthy one. Come back, and hook / redown the first guy after. DS is done by then.
---
As I said, that is not optimal, especially in the red ranks. Slugging is not only boring for both sides, but the person is going to get picked up before you return more often than not so you would have wasted a hook opportunity PLUS the downed survivor who is now picked up still has DS in his back pocket.
---
&gt; You can also down him, pick him up, and eat the literal less than a second stun Enduring grants you.
---
I know Enduring helps, but my complaint was that they are considering not having Enduring help at all, so your point is moot i this change goes through. There will be no perk at all that would be able to reduce the stun time and killers will either have to avoid an unhooked player for 60 seconds irregardless of the circumstance or else. 
---
&gt; It's a near worthless perk, now. Just because it was bad and abused before shouldn't mean it should be trash. It should always be 3 seconds, same as wiggling out.
---
DS does not deserve any sort of sympathy buff. It has been too bad for too long toward killers. And it *is* 3 seconds, probably a little more. It's only reduced when a killer has a perk to counter that, which is completely reasonable and logical and the way it should be. 
---
Every perk - all perks - should have a counter to it. Everything should be a risk/reward. DS, of all perks, should not be immune to this for it has absolutely earned the ire of every killer main that despises it. Four different survivor perks that counters BB&amp;Q, and three base-game mechanics that counter it as well. But killers can't have one damn perk that counters DS.. give me a break. The violin is for you or anyone else that feels that DS having one counter is "too much" and "too unfair".
---
What hentai is this? 
---
It’s funny because my brother has been getting nothing but red ranks and he is rank 12. He’ll get at least 1-2 reds per game 
---
&gt;And also it’s not like DBD is scary
---
For YOU. That's a fucking child, you idiot. Then we can give  the child also alcohol, because it's not bad for you.
---
Fun right!!!
---
I BUMPED INTO A FEW FRIENDS WHILE PLAYING AND WE DECIDED TO SWF TOGETHER. WE HAD SOME BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS LYING AROUND SO WE FIGURED WE'D HAVE A GOOD TIME AND GET SOME EXTRA BP.
---
* SET OF BPS #1 - FACE CAMPING LEATHERFACE
---
* SET OF BPS #2 - KILLER DCS INSTANTLY. LITERALLY AS SOON AS THE MATCH STARTS THEY LEAVE. OH BOY THE 5000 SURVIVAL BLOODPOINTS WE GOT WERE MULTIPLIED BY THREE!
---
* SET OF BPS #3 - TWO PEOPLE DON'T LOAD IN.
---
IT HAS BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN THAT PLACING BLOOD ON A BIRTHDAY STREAMER WILL CAUSE THE SPEED OF ANY NEARBY INTERNET HOTSPOT TO DROP BY 70% AND INSTANTLY MAKE ANY NEARBY PERSON A SELFISH ENTITLED ASSHOLE WHO WILL TRY THEIR HARDEST TO AVOID ALL SOCIAL INTERACTION.
---
Never said I was red ranks; I play Killer about 4 times to every one survivor match.
---
You didn't say anything about Enduring being basically base kit on anyone high rank, so I don't know why you keep acting like people bring it to counter DS, oh no, my one perk that counters it.
---
 You also said "if they're set on tunneling." Yeah, that's literally the only reason someone would run this perk now. It's one more chance out of it, and getting .75 seconds after getting tunneled makes this perk very, very undertuned.
---
As it is, I'm saying it's not functionally 3 seconds, it's .75 to almost any post-rank 10-5 killer, except a Nurse.
---
 This isn't a sympathy buff, this is a way, like BBQ, Devour Hope, and Make your Choice, to incentivize killers not tunneling or camping someone out. Is a stick, not a carrot, and you're acting like putting it back in a place where it can function is entitlement. 
---
It should work for someone worried about getting tunneled, that isn't next to a hook, and only once. Look, you're absolutely coming off to me like this perk should be worthless as a punishment, and that sounds way more entitled than addressing that while the meta has been significantly improved for Killers, the reworked perk is absolutely bad.
---
I don't think nurse would be any issue for him, since she never really enters a new realm.   
---
Spirit? Maybe. 
---
..you probably deserved the facecamp 
---
Whats with the martyr complex?? every single person in DBD has had someone leave on them, both killer and survivor. Why do you feel the need to make a post crying about how bad you have it... especially since they most likely left because you "liked Legions back story". You're the one that needs to grow up and stop acting like a petulant little child, you're probably a grown ass man. You freak.
---
But that assumes the hatches do not follow the rules, pallets at least make sense since Entity wants a good show.   
---
I'd imagine that the hatches would follow the rule, but she herself cant see him, and would prob be more focused on targets irl.
---
Your yt gave me a brain tumor so ig that’s a start
---
Oh Old Sport..
---
Jokes on you escaping legion is super easy, all you gotta do is alt-f4
---
lol +1
---
Usually he tiers up in a chase, though. That'd mean he's more than 40m away...
---
Yo what song is this? Sounds good
---
It’s lavender 
---
Survivor side: Ran 4 times to 20-19 rank killers that had 1-30hrs in DbD. (Rank 10)
---
If clown is your favourite you have issues. 
---
Running bloodhound doesn't mean you're moonwalking.
---
Doing gens isn't gen rushing. ONLY doing gens is gen rushing. There's nothing fun about playing a slow killer and hooking the first survivor when 2-3 gens have been done already because everybody bought a toolbox for a very obvious reason.
---
Bubba useing speed limiter.
---
This path is just.. wow
---
I can't even play the game. I tried asking this sub but bot deleted my post. If anyone's interested to help me, feel free to reply
---
the final boss
---
Y’all sound like a lot of fun to play with lmao. I’m always paranoid of a possible Myers showing up, especially in Lery’s.
---
Oh the baby tums oh the baby tums 
---
DCing against a killer because you don't know how to play against them means you suck. DCing against a killer because its a soul sucking experience is something I find more acceptable.  
---
Killers have literally threatened me after a bad match, telling me that if they ever saw me again, they would put on Legion with Frank's mix tape (I am dead ass serious). That is the worst thing that they could think of to threaten another human being with in that context. They choose this because it creates a situation in which the other player is absolutely powerless. The thing is, the player isn't really powerless, because they can just DC. If you put a rational human in a position where their options are to experience a totally powerless scenario, or to opt out, I think you will find that most often they will opt out. Considering how many people DC when facing Legion, and no other killer, it's pretty clear that he is the problem.
---
and then discover that the killer uses Iron Maiden
---
At this point I'm curious how much of her is textured. I wouldn't be surprised if her full body was textured, considering Feng's lunar dress has actual panties underneath.
---
Plus, I think we can all agree the game was terrifying in the first few games if we went in blind.
---
I’m still not sure. Some people are saying she’s OP while others think she’s balanced. I haven’t played DBD since the chapter came out so I can’t really form an opinion, but from what I’ve seen she seems infuriating to play against. One single fully charged vomit will get you into the broken status the she can M1 you. I don’t want to go as far as to say she’s as broken as legion, but she does not seem fun to play against. I probably won’t be playing DBD for a while because of this killer, and also the fact that outside the very minor change, console still isn’t optimized. Still pisses me off that Freddy has to wait even longer for his rework since the devs are gonna work on legion. 
---
😠👉 PLEASE DEVS 🙇 REMOVE ANY KIND OF FUN IN MY VIDEO GAME PLEASE 🤗💪
---
Mwhahahahaha! I'm glad I prefer playing solo
---
When you cleanse yourself versus Plague you essentially give her the ability to insta down  
---
The third one is kinda lame if you don't care about getting the 4k, but the second one sounds real good with Tinkerer and Billy/Nurse/Spirit.
---
Oink. 
---
it's by no means a strong perk, but it by all means is only used by bad killers, OR people memeing trying to specifically do an endgame build
---
I stopped at '100% revolves around supporting the killer'. Yuup I'm thinking what you think I am, just another one. Bye lol
---
If they took post game chat away from PC the community would start to fall. I’m sure half the players play this game just to chat shit &amp; be dicks
---
&gt; Not really sure what you mean by averting aggro.
---
if you can't handle eating a DS then you just stop chasing obsession
---
&gt;Slugging is extremely situational and rarely happens
---
Nope. Slugging is very strong. If you know where another survivor is, try slugging the first dude you down and head straight to the next guy, especially if they're already injured.
---
&gt;I don't understand how a DC could ever help survivors more.
---
Play the game more.
---
She’s kind of lame. The new killer perks are lame. The new survivor perks are trash. The new map is god awful. The chapter introduced more bugs than it fixed. It all sucks. Makes me wanna take a longgg break.
---
Personally, I love the DS changes, as both killer and survivor. As killer, I don't have to worry about p3 claudys getting a free second chance along with a 4 second stun. As survivor, I no longer see the perk as a cunt-ish perk, so I use it. At least the toxic jackholes can't be as toxic now. 
---
Yeah in the past I'd make a lobby and within the minute, I'd find people to kill. Now I got to wait several minutes  plus some more after I made the lobby :( needs some getting used to
---
NOED wasn't a problem until it was unnecessarily buffed so that EVERY killer runs it. Most of the time it's only worth it to try and cleanse all the totems if you're in a SWF group because otherwise (thanks to no totem counter) you have no idea if your braindead teammates are also cleansing the dulls. 
---
If you spend the game with only you going around to cleanse them then it's unlikely you'll get to the endgame anyway thanks to your incompetence in letting your team down by not doing gens. 1 person is hooked, 1 person is chased and 1 person is going for the save while you do gens- oh wait no sorry you're busy finding and cleansing dull totems for a perk the killer *may* not have. 
---
Faster to DC
---
I bring pudding. 
---
No, but you can see scratch marks and listennnnn o-O
---
What the 
---
&gt; 
---
Yeah, that works. At the cost of abandoning a survivor because their perk is too strong.
---
&gt; Nope. Slugging is very strong. If you know where another survivor is, try slugging the first dude you down and head straight to the next guy, especially if they're already injured.
---
I use a huntress slugging build, I know it's very strong. It's still very difficult to pull off against four people, three is possible but still difficult.
---
&gt; Play the game more.
---
Don't be a dick. DC'ing is a terrible idea.
---
You know what sucks? They only fix bugs once every 6 weeks. And when they fix those bugs, more will take their place.
---
Short killers when? 
---
No I hate leatherfuk
---
Fair, but not all perks have to be useful in every circumstance. I think it might be fun for streamers who like to do 4ks in a row or something. Plus, with the new patch, you almost have to get 4ks every match to even keep your pip at all depending on your rank.
---
Honestly considering the daily for co-op action that is only worth like 25000 or 30000 where you have to do it for THREE MINS its like damn that shit takes like a whole day of me playing survivor to complete without like refusing to do a gen unless someone else is on it and praying they dont have a toolbox so we finish it slower
---
I would readily provide it but it's impossible to do so reliably since I can't revert updates, sorry about that.
---
Ikr, they really need to make opening exits harder
---
i agree but still its going to happen i dont think there is anything they can do to fix camping so its here to stay
---
Well with the new pip system gen rushing me actually be a bad thing. Will survivors pip if lets say 2 of them focus on gens only and the other 2 on the killer only? This would also result in let points. Don't get me wrong escaping is escaping but it feels as there's more to be gained from each side by not gen rushing. Well I guess technically you could gen rush and then mess around after so that you have and escape available if things get to risky.
---
Whenever I want to make myself look like that, I play Leatherface. Nobody likes that guy xD
---
lol
---
Hell some killers can 4K and depip. 
---
It’s a joke. 
---
Looks like Han Solo from Star Wars
---
Can't check the details from here, but I'd suspect only Rin or Wraith might be capable of pulling Freddy into a realm where he can actually be killed.
---
But... The only way, I can think of, destroying Rin is to banish her spirit. And since only the Entity could do that you'd need a combatant who's good mates with the Entity. So Nea wins.
---
As long as they airlift all the previous killers back in and continue the story, I would be super hyped for a second game. They can even doll out returning challengers as *paid* DLC if the game is varied enough, and I'd be fine. I don't know, I just feel like the lore and characters are an underrated aspect of this game. 
---
How much do you love that killer...If the answer is A LOT and you see yourself play that killer a lot, you can prestige....that's when you reach lvl 50 (max lvl) and you reset your level. That option will be unlocked. Do it and you get the bloody weapon...Do it three times in total (the prestige) and you'll get a full bloody prestige cosmetic set for your character. But everytime you prestige you need to level up again and gather all your items (apart from cosmetics, you lose EVERYTHING). So in total it would be three times to 50 to prestige, and a fourth time to finish it and gather all the perks for one final time. Complete him first and you'll have less perks to unlock (cause you don't unlock the teachables from other killers yet). I leveled most of my killers to 40 and as a result all those teachable perks are in my bloodwebs, which makes it harder for me to unlock the desired perk, cause there's less chance for it to appear :c Keep that in mind for when YOU level
---
Ruin is so common anymore this recent change doesn't even bother me like it should. It just gets boring gen tapping every game now. In regards to SWF, I'm surprised they bail when it's used. 4 man SWF you'd think would just gen tap together but I guess not. 
---
No. Totem spawns are still garbage and i feel like they are even worse.
---
I don't want to play this way man. It's such a downer when I load into a lobby and tell myself "I have to kill every survivor in this game or I'm not going to get a pip". I just want to mindlessly take on chases and play like an idiot sometimes, I don't want every match to be a sweatfest
---
Crotus Prenn is the smallest map in terms of tiles. Most maps have ~15 - which when included with jungle gyms, big loops like on the Ironworks or the School in Haddenfield, and with proper looping is **more** than enough. 
---
At high ranks I have never seen all the pallets used in recent memory. For both sides. 
---
Its a bug. McLean confirmed that.
---
Amazing play?? Killer is like zero skill 😅 wow moonwalk
---
I don't know, just kill them :/
---
I rank up without intent
---
I still feel like instead of copying Legion, they combined Legion and Pig with the interesting aspects of each. I still think Plague's abilities are a lot more interactive and strategy inducing. 
---
I just realized I'm a underappreciated artful Dodger, my team's a bunch of gen jockeys always busting gens out and leaving me on the hook usually because of noed. Big sad
---
Is this going on on all systems? I'm on ps4 and most matches look like this, although I did run into a few reds
---
Not much of a gimmick, but I love it nonetheless.
---
On Trapper I run Brutal Strength, BBQ and Chilli, Ruin, and Save the Best for Last. I dub it my "Better than Average" Build because I do everything better than the average killer. I break pallets faster, make more bp, delay the game more, and hit people faster.
---
Also basement build on hillbilly. So nice to drag someone down and laugh knowing this will be the last time they see the feel the pale moonlight against their skin as metal pierces flesh
---
I played for a while, but never heard of fox camping, where did the fox one come from?
---
Same same. I’m 12 and I got rank 2 killer who then apologized post game in a message. I told them it wasn’t there fault, it’s a pretty good job so far. 
---
Yes...this matchmaking system needs some getting used to
---
I was playing on PS4 in kyf and noticed Ashley's perks
---
Oh yeah yesterday I didn't do any cleansing, I remained sick. To troll a bit and have some more fun on top of having no perks on my Dwight. But yeah I only  SAW the Plague use her red vomit thing once.
---
I would like this more if devs color coded the auras of totems.
---
Orange aura = Ruin
---
Green aura = thrill
---
Blue aura = Devour hope
---
Yellow aura = Haunted grounds
---
White aura = NOED
---
Or something to the effect.
---
i dONt kNow AboUT u BUt iM nEVeR wROnG
---
Jane for me. Latinas always and again in dbd, it just confirms it some more
---
I find it fun to be honest, I can infect my team mates lmao
---
Or you just jelly cause you can't spit that far
---
Using tier 1 borrowed time, so toxic
---
Damn survivors are creating more and more terms to use when they're angry
---
Why 'fox' though?
---
No idea whatsoever lmao😂 And yeah people are so toxic nowadays...
---
Legion thanatophobia, Sloppy butcher. And the rest dont matter cause 1 stab is enough to find them all.
---
Or her active camo
---
Doing the objective? Playing the objective, you illiterate heathen.
---
Well technically Hag counters looping with her being short AF and her traps... 
---
THEY'RE NOT BUGGED JUST THE NEW PIPPING SYSTEM MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH THE "MERCILESS KILLING" REQUIREMENT. ALMOST IF NOT NEEDING TO DOUBLE PIP SHOULD NOT BE EQUIVALENT TO SIMPLY SURVIVING 
---
I'm now waiting for a term for killers that circle around the hook area isntead of being just close...what's that going to be called? 
---
Shark camping? Sharking? Vulturing? .-. facepalm
---
Does anybody even read the subreddit before posting?
---
Whenever I play a farm map and I'm in the corn this "survivor found" pops up and I'm like: "Really? Where?"
---
Yeah, my issue is the fact that full on loops using only one window exist. Usually the shack. It’s disgusting and the only thing you can do is TRY to mindgame it.
---
No I meant crotus prenn had 11 and another map, I can't remember which one; possibly family residence, had only 8 including the shack. Several times I've been chasing a survivor round a corner to where a pallet should be and I easily get a hit in because there isn't one there. It's not hard to get rid of jungle gym pallets and half of them on a map aren't even safe to loop around anyway. 
---
A good killer physically cannot get less than 3k (mostly due to hatch escapes) unless they're up against a good SWF and with the ranking system now messed up it's easier than ever to win as killer. 
---
Where's Nea? 
---
Ninja-Doc 
---
Hex : Bad matchmaking
---
Is not like you get something from ranking up  in this game anyway
---
still waiting for a Hag cosplay
---
mostly just to see if someone could do it with a reasonable degree of quality
---
no, they just fuked up matchmaking this bad 
---
If I remember correctly you could still get a de-pip in the scorboard before, but it didn't actually count as a depip. Idk if it's still like that tho.
---
Games where snitches get their asses handed to them are the best.
---
GET RID OF THE FUCKING SHAPE
---
Could use this chance to actually learn Nurse without Ruin or 3 blinks :^)
---
Also besides the snarky remark I'm serious this is probably the best time to practice
---
What servers?
---
&gt; I know 100% that the data from the Dev 86 stream does not include them.
---
How. You can't make a statement like that without using evidence.

I'm rank 2 killer rn, I'll trade you. My rank 15 for your rank 3, sounds good?

Add Nurse's and Bloodhound, and you sir have the ability to flawlessly play Legion.

You win this round of OwO UwU and congratulate you

Tbh Claudette mask is the easiest one because there are like a huge lot of them and some don't even know that hiding is a thing.

Jake on the other hand... Monto is on PC so I have ho fukken clue how to get this mask on console
---
As someone who is not visually impaired this makes me think I am.
---
I bet wraith could go into the dream world with his bell. Or wake himself up. 
---
i haven't tried this build yet but i have been thinking about it, it was going to be a survivor ultimate aura reading build, it would consist of Bond and Empathy for the ultimate survivor aura reading and Alert to see the killer every once in a while. i feel like Alert is an underrated perk, it's really good and has saved my life a number of times. as for the 4th perk, i haven't really thought of one since i main Tapp, i was thinking of Detective's Hunch, however that perk isn't really good since it's only 5 seconds? i feel like if it was buffed to 30 or at least 15 seconds, i would totally use it in this build. 
---
and you know what im gonna use it anyway because this is a gimmick build
---
« Annoying hands » I love it haha
---
&gt; Never said I was red ranks; I play Killer about 4 times to every one survivor match.
---
I was speaking for myself, I am red rank. I am speaking from a place of being d-striked for two years and having no counter to it. And now that we finally get one the devs are considering ripping it from us. Two years of waiting and we don't even get a month to savor a counter. Utter and complete bs. It makes me hate that perk even more.
---
&gt; You didn't say anything about Enduring being basically base kit on anyone high rank, so I don't know why you keep acting like people bring it to counter DS, oh no, my one perk that counters it.
---
People don't bring in Enduring just for DS, but it's a pretty sweet side effect to have it for. I myself only run it when I have Spirit Fury to go along with it, but it gives me a great amount of pleasure to see it utterly ruin any d-striker's chance a free escape. I hope more killers run it than already is. 
---
&gt; You also said "if they're set on tunneling." Yeah, that's literally the only reason someone would run this perk now. It's one more chance out of it, and getting .75 seconds after getting tunneled makes this perk very, very undertuned.
---
Good. D-strikers deserve no mercy, no sympathy, no second chances. And it should 100% be counterable. All perks should be counterable, yet it seems the only perks that are ok being countered are killers. Leave Enduring alone. We don't have a great pool of great perks to choose from as is. And hex placements are still a joke.
---
&gt; Edit: Re: Slugs getting rescued: ( If they ran DS, and you don't / can't eat it, and somebody picks them up; can you really call that a missed hook opportunity? That wasn't your hook at all, if you didn't get them on it. Slugging is boring, but you shouldn't always go for unsafe hooks, and that's just common sense. )

Snowballing is very important for killers, especially high rank ones. Ruin, for the 30 seconds it lasts before it's cleansed, is nice but then all you have to depend on is hooking as many people as fast as possible in order to get one survivor dead as fast as possible because 3 players left with at least 3 gens means you have a great chance at winning (and what I consider winning is at least 3 kills. 2 escapes is just a tie).
---
We don't have time to babysit slugs. We don't have time to pass up an injured survivor who is running right in front of us because of DS. Every hook is crucial to eliminating that survivor. Getting DS'd by a window, or a pallet, or even worse next to an infinite means that our hook momentum is gone and more time is about to be wasted chasing down a survivor who we have already outplayed and should have been awarded the hook because we earned it.
---
The new DS doesn't differentiate what is considered tunneling. It doesn't ask the unhooked survivor to play smart and either run to the nearest loop or hide to avoid detection. It doesn't care if the survivor runs in front you by accident after being unhooked. It doesn't care if another survivor unhooks before you leave the area. It doesn't care if you've left and downed/hooked another survivor before returning. It doesn't care if the gates are opened and getting DS would guarantee an escape.
---
No, it just gives any unhooked survivor a full minute of hook immunity, circumstance be damned. And as killers we are told to just suck it up, and on top of it now one of our best perks might get nerfed for this garbage crutch perk. Screw that.
---
&gt; As it is, I'm saying it's not functionally 3 seconds, it's .75 to almost any post-rank 10-5 killer, except a Nurse.
---
With Enduring. Without Enduring it's at least 3 seconds, and it's more likely that the killer won't have it, than do. Enduring is not the equivalent of Self Care for killers. It's not in all builds.
---
And it's *suppose* to counter it. The point of a counter is to stop the action. What good is it as a counter if you still get to run to your loops and waste at 30 more seconds of the killer's time. You're not suppose to escape when a killer has it, that's the whole point. Everything should have a counter, especially the bane of killer mains.
---
But apparently DS is too special to have a counter, except for killer mains to walk past the unhooked survivor and let them go on their merry way for the next 60 seconds to do gens and heal and then t-bag at the exit gate with "gg ez" in the post game chat. Because anything less would be "tunneling". Or better yet, slug the unhooked survivor, wait around while everyone else does gens while the downed survivor gets up due to Unbreakable or Adrenaline, t-bag at the exit gate, and give a gg ez in the post game chat.
---
&gt; This isn't a sympathy buff, this is a way, like BBQ, Devour Hope, and Make your Choice, to incentivize killers not tunneling or camping someone out. It's just a stick, not a carrot, and you're acting like putting it back in a place where it can function is entitlement. 
---
It hasn't even been a week yet, it is a sympathy buff to the outcries of survivor mains who don't like that they have to be more stealthy and can't t-bag the killer without getting hooked after being downed. They abused that for two years and now want the Devs to feel sorry for them.
---
And BBQ has many counters - I don't see the Devs considering removing some of them. Hell they might come up with a new counter for it next month. Devour Hope and hex perk placements in general is still a joke and too easily cleansed - I don't hear survivors asking for better placements. This isn't the same type of complaint. It's survivors asking the devs to make sure there isn't any killer perk that can counter their precious perk. They want the killer to have no recourse but to leave them alone for a full minute after being unhooked or to suffer getting d-striked AND having the killer's obsession perks screwed with as an extra slice of this garbage pie. They want total advantage not "fairness". It's never been about fairness. They didn't give a crap for two years about what killers went through but now want killer mains to feel sorry for them. DS has not earned that.
---
&gt; It should work for someone worried about getting tunneled, that isn't next to a hook, and only once. Look, you're absolutely coming off to me like this perk should be worthless as a punishment, and that sounds way more entitled than addressing that while the meta has been significantly improved for Killers, the reworked perk is absolutely ruined when put against one of the top 3 most common Killer perks.
---
I've said in the past that I would be completely ok with DS being grounded into dust and the dust being thrown into a volcano. But I am not without reason. I do genuinely dislike camping with tunneling (that's the only type of tunneling I consider true tunneling.) 
---
A killer that chases a survivor that is near you  and is thus near you himself is not a camper, and a killer that has left you and returned after looking for another victim is not tunneling you. And I abhor any perk or mechanic which punishes a killer for out-thinking and/or out playing a survivor and denying him his reward of hooking you which is why I loathe DS, past version and current version.
---
The idea I came up with was one that helped curb true tunneling and true camping (and it didn't involve DS or nerfing Enduring). It was: 
---
* An unhooked survivor is granted 10 seconds of damage immunity upon being rescued. However if the killer is within 16 meters of the hooked survivor for 15 consecutive seconds **and** there are no others survivors within 12 meters of the hooked survivor during the first 15 seconds, both the unhooker and the unhooked survivors are granted 10 seconds of damage immunity during a rescue.
---
* Does not apply if exit gates are opened.
---
It would be a base mechanic for the game, no perks necessary. Best of all it has qualifiers, and doesn't punish killers for doing their job at an optimal level. And everyone would know the rule and would be prepared to strategise around it. DS could be eliminated, and tunneling/camping could be fixed to a great degree.
---
Fellow Hag main \o

We are so rare that we win by people forgetting how to play against us.

The nurse has to be entering something when she blinks. Freddy wouldnt be able to see wraith to sleep hin assuming he was the ladt one left.

---
Nurses is not needed if I have bloodhound. Discordance would make a better fit. Or ruin. The 4th slot is a bit of a Joker slot cause anything can be useful there. Iron grasp, Ruin, ect.
---
Showed him who is boss of this ~~gym~~ fog
---
I played a game yesterday where I had 3 people on hook at the same time and the last one disconnected when I found him. I depipped
---
In the long run yes, but in the short term they'd need to make all those cosmetics. And how would it work? would it be a random one everytime you reach rank 1? or would you get to choose? if you depip to rank 2 and go back do you get another one? It's great in theory but would take a lot of time and effort. But hey, bunny feng could be one of them
---
gimmicking for running away, dance with me, quick and quiet, lithe, and iron will you get chased and fast vault and hope they didn't see where you went(works fairly well)
---
Seriously. I get so many grabs from people jumping back over a pallet because my trap went off, it's glorious. Sometimes I feel like they don't know that I can choose to *not* teleport to the trap. Using the camera flick to make them bump into corners and walls is hilarious too.
---
I play both but I’m prepared for the hate. But it seems like recently they just keep favoring the killer side 
---
\*Just Legion\*
---
Not gonna lie
---
Yeah she can seem strong but the constant instaheals really balance out her pressure.
---
Obviously you've probably played against enough good Billys/Nurses to know that when these guys are on a snowball it's extremely hard to come back since you're slowed down by healing or you don't get chance to heal and so you go down in one hit.
---
This is why I think the instaheals are balanced despite killer mains still complaining. She's a strong killer but survivors get like 10 second heals against her. It just makes for a faster paced game.
---
Ero-vomit. You don't pronounce the t by the way so it sounds Frenchy. 
---
Gen rush means no pip so no, it is litteraly not playing well.
---
I just found it funny to spot a claudette fixing a gennie, and then me the green smelly Dwight come in, touch the gen, infect everything, and you see Claudette running off, puking hahaha
---
With the dedicated servers coming, this might be much easier to implement actually, since you can also easily see whether the person just "left the game" or the client actually, physically lost connection.
---
That doesn't stop people from just janking their network cable, but at least it would make way to punish disconnects in the game, especially early in the game.
---
lol nice with the music!
---
*violent puking sounds. 
---
Has never happened to me but to someone I played SWF with for a trophy (I usually play only solo). So I can tell you the problem existed already in the Legion patch, it’s just extremely rare.
---
And as a software developer, I can also tell you that fixing such stuff that happens rarely and cannot be reliably reproduced is very hard to fix, sadly.
---

Jump scare myers. Dying light, bloodhound, iron grasp, and Franklin's demise. Use boyfriend's note and the scratched mirror add ons with either the game or the léry's memorial institute. Tunnel obsession and proceed to terrorize remaining survivors.
---
They take 2 and a half minutes normally
---
2 minutes with a tampered timer 
---
The gear add ons don’t reduce the timer, the increase the time it takes to search boxes and decrease the time it takes to put the trap on
---
I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them. They're just there.
---
Red rank survivors have been pushed out of red ranks, because it is impossible to stay where now, so you probably getting rank 1 survivors in your games. And at rank 1 it is usually, no heal gens at all cost meta, adrenaline if we get to end game. Rank 1 survivors usually are confident enough to run around killer even if they are injured.

Not gonna lie, they got us in the first half

I once bullied a trapper for the whole game, then bm’d him... rightfully got hooked but then the other people just sat there, waiting to be pushed out (I mean rightfully so), went to kill self on hook, got off and hatch opened right next to me. I felt so bad poor guy ended up being rank 20 (against 4 under 10 ranks)
---
That's Nurse's karma for hitting you on the hook
---
Yikes a comment about liking Legion, you should get out of here, it's not safe for you

or probably not

Is this true?

"I don't want every match to be a sweatfeat"
---
Then don't sweat. If you can have fun, and do what feels good, why make it about ranking up? 
---
&gt;It still eliminates great skill checks, which dramatically lower time to complete gen.
---
Its 1.6 seconds saved per great skillcheck, its not that big of a deal
---
But playing balanced are more fun.

Oh im doing it on purpose. I know what happends.

Thats fucking it

No Mither, Self Care, Solidarity, and Adrenaline.

&gt; SINCE KILLERS WON'T EARN A PIP IF THEY DON'T GET AT LEAST A 3K
---
I CAN'T PIP AS NURSE EVEN WITH A 4K BECAUSE THE GAME ENDS TOO QUICKLY. I WANT TO RANK UP SO I'M NOT VS SO INEXPERIENCED PLAYERS BUT I WOULD NEED TO INTENTIONALLY PLAY BADLY TO ACTUALLY RANK UP. WHAT THE HELL DEVS, DOES NO ONE TEST THESE CHANGES?
---
IF EITHER SIDE IS STRONGER, NO ONE PIPS UNLESS THEY FORCE HITS/HOOKS/CHASES. EVEN IF THE SIDES ARE EQUALLY STRONG THERE'S NOT ENOUGH POINTS TO GO AROUND.

*sudden audio notification and the sound of piss leaking down my leg.

Happened to me yesterday and I legit started running round in circles confused as the music wouldn’t go away, she was crouched under my eyesight the entire time.

Bitch Claudette got camped
---
EVERY DAMN TIME
---
Tfw you flee the killers terror radius only to run into Legion and DC cos you ain’t got time for that shit
---
😂😂
---
I know people say it’s acceptable and that to camp when the exit gates are open but I really dislike it and I’m always super happy when I see videos of it failing miserably.
---
You know that nurses controller went right through their TV
---
Always upvote Jojo 
---
I guess they never miss, huh?
---
Adrenaline is fine the way it is. It’s a situational perk, as is NOED, if you play your cards right. Why nerf something that’s completely fine?  
---
I swear killers would prefer all of us on the hook at the start of the match
---
Every time I play against Michael
---
She’s one lanky fuck 
---
Oh no...
---
Almost more infuriating is when all three are on a single gen. I understand 2 on one gen, but yall don't have to have a knitting circle. Sure your not hiding in a locker but what are we getting out of this?
---
Mint rag, rusty shackles and MYC distance camping
---
Just do gens if the killer is camping.
---
If you're the one getting camped, just stay alive as long as possible, dont kill yourself.
---
So, it's what, 5 reds to pip now? &gt;&lt;
---
Wednesday is the usual day for cosmetics 
---
I'd change stridor with thanatophobia and it's not the perks they were talking about, it was that the franklin's mixtape was the only addon option

*Laughs back in Nurse’s Calling, NOED, BBQ and Chilli, Ruin,  Thanataphobia and related “op” killer perks
---
Guess you're getting...
---
"Luckyy".
---
poor baby killers getting rekt by rng
---
Are you sure mate
---
*Several people are typing*
---
That would be horror indeed. The stun should be buffed tough, I don't understand how they tought that making the perk more situational would go well with a stat nerf
---
*Survivor play rate drops to 0%*
---
Get better at the game nerd, lmao.
---
As much as I hated it I agree, if it’s an anti-tunneling perk niche then it should still retain that devastating stun
---
I've never seen it as trying to demean anyone or lambast a cheap tactic. It's simply referring to survivors that don't get distracted by secondary objectives- don't mess with chests, dull totems, etc- and just bang out gens as fast as they possibly can.
---
There's nothing wrong with that, it's just something the killer needs to be conscious of and guard against. Stuff like Ruin helps slow that down, stuff like NOED punishes survivors for it, the 3 gen strat is especially important, etc.
---
Nice and slow ☺😍
---
Grouping up is necessary to rush the last few gens, which are the most challenging/dangerous ones, anyway.
---
You know what...this is pretty well said! As a survivor main, NOED was annoying to deal with but I was never too bothered about it. Just take Small Game and do totems?? Also if you're smart enough you can still open Exit Gates even with NOED and not get hit.
---
This is actually a good point.
---
I like this screenshot. Very cinematic.
---
I'm famous
---
Your rude
---
That will teach em not to BM in the future
---
Happy cake day
---
The fact people still moonwalk when looking down is easier and far more reliable is just stupid.
---
Blessed reply. 
---
Breaking the totem.
---
You do get banned if your DC rate is like 50%. It should be lower.
---
Lol they were quite thorough it seems. 
---
I imagine this is only because of how late the skill check was in the circle. Still, it shouldn't happen with how the Perk is intended to work now.
---
Stop, don't do that
---
Try me. I'll smack you with my locker perk. Nice cosplay!
---
You can only truly **A S C E N D** if you play DBD so you can stare at the Spirit's ass in the Main Menu
---
I think it's acceptable to camp as well, especially if you don't have any kills yet, that doesn't mean that video's like this don't make me happy.
---
The thing that made me happy the most was that she hit the hooked survivor and paid for it. I hate killers that hit the hookes survivor for no reason. It's the killer equivalent of survivors T-bagging at the exit gates and it's always heart warming to see the cockyness of people backfire
---
Liiiiiiit meme ma boooooooi 💯💯💯🔥🔥
---
They look nothing alike and neither of their backstories hint towards any relation. So i'd say they're not related.
---
&gt;It just gets boring gen tapping every game
---
Umm, maybe don't gen tap? It's literally less effective than working through ruin. 
---
Yeah doctor players are like the most obvious tunnelers. I got tunneled 3 times. Had a pig with enduring and i couldnt out distance her.
---
And if it’s about exit gates powered camping. The killer just want a kill at this point. And there’s more risk than reward going out to chase someone after hooking.
---
Mori spamming a little at first with 5 stacks is always appropriate. I love it
---
While someone is getting eaten 4 feet away. 
---
Every time I watch that show I wanna die
---
Don't be rude
---
I like your suggestion for NOED, but don't agree with your commentary at all and think it's.. extremely apologistic and weird.. you can make suggestions about killer perks without performing your hatred for survivors and how you're a "good survivor" all over the post you know, I think that is allowed.
---
Please stop you're scaring my cat
---
If they stand still for 4 seconds then I will assume it is
---
I can't believe I never realised the potential meme of this scene. This is gonna be gold. 
---
You mean your *neko* girl? *grao!*
---
Martyr complex? Jesus Christ this community really is full of themselves. I made a simple post, not “crying” about anything, just subtly drawing attention to the fact that consistent games people have disconnected on purpose. 
---
All I want to do is enjoy the game but in an online game that depends on other players, it sucks when people ruin it. That’s all there is to it
---
I hope they're tweaking the rank system because they're gonna add rewards soon. If not, I have no clue why they'd make ranking up this hard.
---
I was on the other side of this in a different game. The killer can’t see you, only your huge texture. Yet you still have normal hitbox.
---
^^^its free real estate
---
 While it would be nice to punish people that abuse it the way the game is right now, dc punishment should not even be a passing thought as long as most of the following are a thing:
---
*Killers trapping people in the basement or other places until they dc, maybe have them go through the killer after some time, and yes i know this is used to wait out BT at some cases, but trapping someone for a minute and more should not be a thing, they can tweak it accordingly.
---
*Spawning on parts of the map that get you stuck (rather rare but still happening)
---
*Getting stuck on something while playing. This mostly goes to killers, and yes the survivors can do gens and escape, but we should not be left at the mercy of randoms that could have all the time in the world and decide to do almost nothing that game.
---
*Games that start with 3 or less survivors, nobody wants to play against a killer at such a disadvantage.
---
*Survivors reaching spots the killer can't get them until the killer either dc's or goes afk hoping the survivor has not done the same and actually escapes at some point.
---
In the rage Wednesday people have even listed more new bugs that prevent you from playing right now, even multiple times in a row, why be punished for wanting to leave a match in which you are bugged and cannot play a game you paid for?
---
Timer should always be 60 seconds and stun be 3/3.5/4, maybe even increase 1 second
---
^^^^*its* ^^^^*free* ^^^^*real* ^^^^*estate*
---
Wait that illegal 
---
It’s like a lot of other things in the game: random between a few different options of where to be.
---
I posted an update for colored icons.
---
My friends and I are going to a con this weekend as a group of killers and survivors, feel free to join 😅
---
Is that Kate in the background? 🤔
---
A lot of players of this game *really*, really want nobody to want to play survivor anymore lol.
---
devs themselfes said they are thinking about to remove the levels from perks months ago. isntead they are making perks viable on lvl 1
---
As a killer they literally punish you for ranking up
---
&gt; the only truly viable killers
---
&gt; the only way you can 4K
---
that is not being viable. Being viable is getting an average 2K at high ranks
---
Agitation, Iron grasp, Insidious and Monstrous Shrine.....Yeah &gt;:)
---
I play both Killer and Survivor but am more of a Killer main and agree NOED is f**king stupid.
---
My problem exactly. I don't care about the number, in fact if there were rewards I'd probably still not care, but the experience now in the middle-ish 12-7 or so ranks is either too easy or too hard, with very little middle ground. 
---
Nope
---
And then you find out they’re playing Legion with Frank’s mixtape
---
You don't differentiate, you say all survivors are "entitled and toxic", and then position yourself as the "good survivor" by going on about how *you* don't teabag and *you* don't do the "awful" things other survivors do.. it's really performative like "please killers don't hate me".
---
Anyway I have to alter my feedback as I didn't realize you wanted NOED to be part of the killer's basic kit in which case... hell no that's terrible. It should still be a perk and be a one-time instant down and that's it. Especially after what they did to DS (which you claim was "unfair" but you don't think NOED is unfair... lol, pander to killer players harder) and all the killer buffs over the last several months, it's just unnecessary. Your suggestion is really just "reward bad killers as a matter of course"... not great.
---
I was rooting for you
---
Outfit looks great, BTW!
---
Hag is actually the tallest of the small killer if she stands up straight 
---
Personally, I've gotten more use out of decisive now than I have before. You can take a hit after getting rescued to save the person that rescued you. You can't be dribbled to prevent the use of your perk. And the skillcheck is easier. And as far as the suggested NOED change, having it be a one time use makes a big difference. In it's current state, you can't body block a NOED killer. You hesitate to save if NOED is active, and the killer can easily 4k with NOED alone. That's what makes it frustrating. If it is just one time use, it only adds pressure. That's it. It's not an instant win button. Feel free to add any suggestions though.
---
Thanks dude! :D
---
Fucking true XD
---
P3 Claudette intensifies!!!
---
Haha nice one rank 14
---
I'll come rescue you, hold still
---
Body blocking can only get you banned if you hold the game hostage. Since you killed him I guess instantly you have not broken any rules.
---
mom youre embarrasing me
---
Because all you have to do is destroy totems which is ez on swf and if solo run small game or detectives hunch also noed is a punish for gen rushing.
---
Then it's up to your team to do gens and you to stay alive on the hook. 
---
Stupid hunter!!!!!!
---
Me
---
You mean A S S C E N D?
---
I'm not quite sure what you're trying to tell me
---
Maybe cause we don't like being made fun of?  We get enough of that kind of abuse from SWF groups and streamers.
---
NOOOOOOO MY BABY
---
How about hiding in locker with Daddy Trapper😍😍😍
---
You didn't keep the game hostage (stall the game so it's impossible to anyone to win) so no, you're fine
---
Being punished for doing objectives, seems about right. 
---
*Michael face camping*
---
Thought this was on deathgardens sub lol was thinking “yeah no eff” 
---
Then it hit me. And I liked it.
---
F
---
**They got us in the first half, not gonna lie**
---
I’m not saying that it is bad. I also agree that applying map pressure is really hard for lower tier killers, especially on huge maps like farm. I’m just saying that perk that rewards killer for losing 5 gens is a badly designed perk. 
---
what's bm?
---
Pretty much. Until rewards are involved, rank is a dick measuring contest for the insecure.
---
It is my preference also im not rank 14
---
Immediately 
---
Play something else, then. Take a break. Civilization seems fine
---
SO TRUE
---
Scratch marks are fucked again, i had scratch marks leave a loop and the survivor actually went the other way (didn't fake the direction either).
---
Bad manners, she hit her on the hook so she got recovery period during which she couldnt blink to catch up to her
---
Because Bruce Campbell back in the day gets people's motors running!
---
She reminded me of Jadis from "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe". Just getting somilar vibes. 
---
I choose... MONK!
---
*gets jumped by the whole dbd community*
---
Buttered toast?!
---
So you're saying perks such as adrenaline, unbreakable, and deliverance reward bad survivors? Since they're only of use if you failed at not getting hit? Both sides have things to counter each other, and you should use perks that balance out your weaknesses. I used premonition for a long time since I somehow always managed to run straight into the killer. I'm not pandering to killer players, I'm trying to find BALANCE. An easy 4k with one perk is not balanced, I agree with that. But good survivors will utilize pallets efficiently, take hits for each other, body block, and usually have self-care and adrenaline to make sure they have no fear. A one-time NOED at the end would at least add some intimidation factor to the end-game against good survivors. Can you honestly say it's fun knowing without a doubt that there's no possible way the killer can get any of you because you can all just take hits at the end? This is supposed to be a horror game right? 
---
And I'm not trying to get on the killers good side. As I said, when I play killer, those are the things that frustrate ME. I see these things when I play killer, and it makes me not want to play killer as much. I don't even run NOED, but I play killers that should - Freddy and Pig. And when you play them, suddenly everyones right on top of those totems. Strange how that doesn't happen regardless. People will laugh about doing all totems and preventing NOED but also bitch when they haven't done them and get hit with it. A one time use would prevent both situations. Also, with the suggestion of hook state reduction, it wouldn't be a complete game ender. If anything, it would add MORE gameplay. I don't see how that's a bad thing. I certainly find games more exciting when trying to rescue other survivors once the gates are opened. In case you aren't aware, you can die and still pip.
---
Stake Out + Alert was for me the ultimate Gen Rush combo.
---
It countered Ruin so hard at Rank 1 during the moon rise event and let me escaped so fast! EZ event done in 3 days. xD
---
Even if you did body block, pretty sure they only investigate players with high report levels. Not just one or two reports. Cuts down on the bs reports like yours
---
It's just under 3 seconds.
---
What if I wanted to but I kept playing
---
I’m placing all my money on a Deadite killer
---
Maybe the customization options will be different Deadites from the movies/show?
---
Yeah i cant see shit 
---
Wtf why would you not want to help your teammates? 
---
Stake out is an underappreciated perk and is amazing for gen rushing. Also really good with urban evasion (another underappreciated perk) and prove thyself.
---
My lord, is that legal?
---
Then you're mentally unstable
---
My survivor queue yesterday said the average wait time was 45 minutes... But in reality it took maybe 2 lol. Was strange indeed.
---
All of those perks require actual skill and positioning to use - you can't use Adrenaline unless you survive to a certain point, you have to perform a safe hook rescue to use Deliverance at all *and* it costs you a hook state, and for Unbreakable to work the killer has to leave you slugged long enough for it to activate which is quite a long time and usually requires teamwork (ie another survivor getting the killer's attention before they can pick you up) to work. So all of those perks reward skill, teamwork, and good game sense. NOED rewards... doing nothing but failing to get kills. And if you considered DS pre-nerf to be "broken" then you should definitely see why NOED is also broken and unfair. But you are pandering to killers so you won't admit that of course p:
---
&gt;I'm trying to find BALANCE
---
Giving every killer free NOED isn't balanced though? Even if it's only one instant down it's not balanced. Especially not now when killers have been being buffed over and over again for MONTHS and survivors nerfed over and over again for the same amount of time...
---
&gt;But good survivors will utilize pallets efficiently, take hits for each other, body block, and usually have self-care and adrenaline to make sure they have no fear.
---
Pallets have been nerfed to the point where there are hardly any left on the map to use, taking hits for other survivors and/or body-blocking doesn't work against NOED unless the totem has been cleansed, Self-Care doesn't matter against NOED and neither does Adrenaline... and also every single one of those things is countered by at least *several* killer perks and/or abilities and most of those mechanisms have been nerfed (ie exhaustion nerf)..
---
&gt;Can you honestly say it's fun knowing without a doubt that there's no possible way the killer can get any of you because you can all just take hits at the end?
---
Can you honestly say it's fun to play a game knowing that even if the killer completely fails at literally the entire game and never gets a single hook they'll get a free hook at the end just to make them feel better about themselves? Does that sound fair to you?
---
&gt;This is supposed to be a horror game right?
---
I mean... yes it's horror themed but the game clearly is not meant to be scary? It is meant to be exciting and interesting but it isn't meant to scare you really at all. It isn't that kind of game, the structure of the matches and the style of play make it impossible. So I find this a really bad argument.
---
&gt;And I'm not trying to get on the killers good side.
---
Your post was pretty clearly trying to do exactly this but okay lol.
---
&gt;And when you play them, suddenly everyones right on top of those totems. 
---
Not since the totem changes that make them much more hidden / more difficult to find.
---
&gt;If anything, it would add MORE gameplay.
---
It really wouldn't... it would just be the same boring, frustrating thing as ever: The killer would face camp their courtesy hook and the survivors would have to sit there and decide if they want to chance a rescue or just get on with things.. just like they do against any face camper. There is nothing interesting or fun about dealing with a face camping killer, and it's even worse when the camper only even got the hook because the game gave him a "gimme" because he was doing so badly.
---
What you're suggesting would be great for underachieving, low-skill killers who want to rank up but aren't skilled enough to do it without a major crutch, but it would be terrible for morale and general gameplay and incredibly frustrating and unfair and no fun for survivors. The game has been getting worse and worse for survivors for months now.. it doesn't need to keep going like this.
---
&gt;In case you aren't aware, you can die and still pip.
---
Pipping doesn't matter.

The decisive strike by David is a seductive whisper, they drop him because they’re too horny, easy Science tbf

I do miss her sweet ass, but you can't beat a sick Kimono.
---
Iron Grasp definitely. Btw if you wanna run a carrying perk take agitation. Counters body blocking and you can get the same distance and faster. Iron is like Tenacity. You run it with Unbreakabill (Agitation) but otherwise it’s not as effective.
---
It’s blood orange

Thank you, my friend!

---
Vent e du norsk? Merka akurat brukernavne ditt
---
Does it really matter either way? I don't play often enough to keep a consistent rank but I play often enough to know what I'm doing. That hasn't stopped this new system from constantly sticking me with rank 6/7 survivors as a rank 15 killer.
---
Totem counter for small game doesn't sound bad and gives people reason to use a weak perk.
---
Exponentially increased pipping thresholds based on your rank. 
---
They changed the amount of points needed to rank up. This results in games like doing 2 generators, escaping a chase, unhooking 2 people, and healing one and you'll just barely rank up. Obviously, thats not sustainable to do nor is it likely that even if all 4 escape they all pip
---
a lot of grind with no reward 
---
I finally got back into drawing and decided to warm up with a younger Myers. I tried combining Tony Moran, Tyler Mane, and a little bit of Jamie Lee Curtis as reference points. I figured this would be a good community to upload to :) 
---
Iron Grasp. I use Ruin, Monitor and Abuse,  Enduring and Spirit Fury. 
---
Dude David isn’t just a muscular guy, he is a rugby player.
---
And of course Reddit's jackshit video loading happens
---
I thought that was a given
---
You can get a 3k or sometimes even 4k and still depip
---
I pipped once in the last 4 or 5 killer games and thats when I completely stomped and deserved a double pip
---
You need to hook each survivor 3 times and have to chase them all game and not let them heal, you can't let them do a single gen
---
Basically if the survivors have at least 3 braincells combines you wont double pip ever

There is literally no balance at all in those ranks because the requirements for piping in those ranks are stupid
---
OMG AKDKSHS
---
Is it weird to comment that you *sound* like someone who would type "broken ass textures"
---
True as fck
---
One of the survivors claim 4 people at once reported me and is threatening to send video footage of the game played which I'm fine with. Is that enough to get looked at? 
---
I'm so god damn happy about the change in ranking system. I hated how I'd always inevitably end up as a rank 1 survivor just by playing, amd get put against constant BBQ Billy and nurses but me amd the other survivors would be potatoes 
---
His range add-ons, class photo, and dresses are so much better than his blocks. If you use Z-Block, you're just making freddy an m1 killer. Range, class photo, and dresses heavily help his best benefits, as your main focus as freddy is slowing the survivors down to get kills, not just getting kills.
---
*I think they took a step in the right direction*. 
---
Some points for consideration:
---
1) I see casual and moderate players like myself now being capped at a certain rank which is good; I don’t want to get matched with a hex ruin, noed, bbq Nurse who knows EVERY loop on every map, every game and is trying to get the rank 1 badge.
---
I just wanna run around screaming because Myers has dropped down on me.  
---
2) Scrapping the ranking system would be another option taken away from the players. Having the option to grind is _ALWAYS_ good. You don’t have to do it, but you can if you like that sense of achievement. That keeps people playing, spending money, paying for further development of the game. 
---
3) Being able to have objectives to work towards in game gives players (especially solo players without communication) a structure to go into a match with. 
---
4) It is fun to see how well you do each game and compare your progress over time. 
---
TLDR: Having a ranked system provides more benefits that not having one and I believe Behaviour has taken a step in the right direction, they just need to keep tweaking numbers. 
---
Smurfing is when you intentionally drop rank (or create a new account) to play with lower level players and essentially stomp them into the ground. It happens a lot in other video games.
---

Yeah, I tried to make him pretty average looking but then ended up making him unintentionally sexy?
---
As far as i know it's always been 3 hooks per survivor to max. But i started playing right before the emblem system originally dropped
---
Ah ok :)
---
Its a joke lmao
---
This is only the new system
---
Guys chill He didn’t actually play dbd
---
That minimum distance is ridiculous though. 
---
oh ok
---
Shut up and take my upvotes
---
It's a real perk.
---
You can clearly tell by the fail in the spelling.
---
Iron grasp, it adds like &lt;2 seconds of carry time.
---
You need to cool it with the LSD. ^^^/s
---
lmao fair enough
---
Maybe if they directly contact DBD support, but even with the video, as long as you did nothing wrong like holding the game hostage longer than a couple minutes, there’s no action taken. We’re talking about 50+ reports to get their attention otherwise.
---
Even if you got banned, it would be a temporary ban, slap on the wrist.
---
Yeah, but some can happen multiple times during a bad patch that BHVR releases, like the bug that will not allow you to interact with objects or do other actions. My point is, fix the game a little better, so most if not all of these things are a possibilty that can ruin multiple games in one of your sessions before you try punishing someone for for leaving in one of those cases. Also, don't try and defend this addition with what you said, even if the chance of these things happening is small, the amount of stuff that can happen to you pushes dc punishment down from the list of important things to be fixed/added, no reason having a chance to punish someone for disconnecting because the game fails to work properly.
---
What plot...?
---
People in this sub usually think Myers is sexy. 
---
Toxic survivors always think that Bubba camps. Really insulting... 
---
I dont play killer
---
Camping too much bro :D
---
There might not be rewards, but the skill gap in games is way higher than it used to be
---
Whats your vote? 
---
Freddy main here, range is one of his best add-ons by far.
---
Extremely Insulting 
---
After downing a survivor you can brick their pc
---
Would result in better que times as well
---
I voted huntress by accident lmao. Hillbilly is much more balanced imo as huntress heavily depends on the map. Even the best huntress players can struggle on treatment theatre. 
---
I literally can't get games as survivor or killer.
---
As survivor it takes ages to get a lobby and if i get in it's awful ping. I stay in it regardless because i'm desperate but other survivors don't. Then the killer gives up or his lobby errors and we start from zero.
---
As killer it takes 5 minutes to create the lobby,an indefinite amount of time to get survivors and then erroring every 10 minutes and having to wait 5 more for another lobby.
---
All this and you're not even guaranteed to get into a match because chances are you'l get infinite loading screen or disconnect.
---
The new matchmaking is pure garbage.
---
Unless the killer runs enduring then it's useless because it makes the stun 1 second due to the stun time nerf. They just have to turn around and hit again no chance to gain distance.
---
I was getting 360’d so hard my man
---
Watching this was way more interesting that all of them other plain gameplay videos and I actually laughed xD
---
HOW DARE YOU SAY SOMETHING SO RIGHT?!
---
I think they're both well balanced but the Huntress has a hard time on some maps. Her hatchets aren't great on tight maps like meat plant. Billy works well on most maps because he can travel so fast around the maps, and he can instadown.
---
ikr! hes my main and people cant stand him at rank 8
---
r/beetlejucing
---
Dammit hate when this happens :(
---
They should pair 4 people with a killer and start the match immediately. Get rid of the never ending pointless lobby. With dedicated servers there will be no reason to dodge ping anymore, just start the game already
---
I never had any issues with it. Do you use wireless or wired connection? Because obviously wired connection will work a lot better. Check your network settings and see what it says. 
---
I doubt the person is serious anymore. I wasn't at all rude or inappropriate during our entire conversation but they continued to insult and namecall over something that never happened. After I told them how they were wrong with proof they tried to get a rise out of me by saying more inappropriate things but I'm not at all affected by insults from a delusional person. Not surprising that when I asked for an apology they said and I quote "I don't owe you shit" so yeah very mature.
---
I’m happy that speedrunning games is less rewarding at higher levels. That 4K 5 gens mentality or Do 5 gens in 4 mins and leave mentality can’t work at high rank anymore. Playing with your food is the desired effect. 
---
Early snowballing is out. Mid game/late game is in. 
---
I didn’t create a meme here. This didn’t take 5 minutes. And this took more guts to post online than anything you’ve done, which based on your history is only bitch about shit.
---
No one cares what you studied in college. I seriously doubt you use what you learned because you’re too busy bitching about character voice acting in video games.
---
Read the title cocksucker. I wrote this for fun. You don’t like it. That’s great. Move on.
---
Are you defending face camping right now? Jesus dude.
---
Someonehastistarttheslowclap.png
---
You forgot in the end there to have 2 of the community , one saying what you wrote and the other bitching "OP" and complaining.
---
I was waiting for the Nurse to just teleport right in front of you, hit you then the music stops abruptly lol.
---
Hillbilly because he can instadown and get around the map, but is easily loopable.
---
I have wired connection, checked the connection and router, they are fine. I will try the game again later.
---
Yes right now the killers Internet is used as the lobby. From what I gather when they start matchmaking and you’re paired with a killer there is a delay as you’re actually put in the lobby ~30 seconds or so. During that time, the killer could quit their lobby for any reason - impatience for the last players needed to fill the lobby, bad ping from survivors, didn’t mean to start a lobby, Mom said food is ready, the dog pooped on the floor or anything, really. 
---
You never had to do that in the first place. You could always play the game casually, and not get to rank 1. But now, players who DO play like that and attempt to win as efficiently as possible don’t even pip? Forget hook camping, if you win chases too soon you get punished in general. Wouldn’t the goal be to have chases be as short as possible to delay generator progress, which is another medal? The new system needs adjustments. I like what they were trying to do, but it was an overtuned change imo. 
---
I mean I had 3 survivors DC when they realized I was playing plague
---
It's actually a killer emblem I changed slightly and added some border for prove thyself 
---
can i get uhhhhhh hot husband
---
Wait so you proxy camped a slugged person and they reported you for breaking TOS? Yowch
---
The Game Over trap popping event only give additional points in Sacrifice category for some reason, sadly.
---
Pretty much 
---
The F***
---
Just nightmare things, nbd. 
---
Wish they would have all the DLC ln a discount execpt the Legion one
---
Honestly I’d understand if it was Kate, Meg, maybe even Jane, but you get the real scare when you look at Nea’s ass
---
Most killers who facecamped someone from my team blamed the survivors tho. Whenever I ask "why did you camp" they just go "you genrushed", so they clearly blamed us. Even more hilarious when those kind of killers don't run any anti-gen perks and chase 1 guy for 3 gens instead of switching target and applying pressure
---
If it’s PS4 that’s bannable if you report their message. Otherwise, sounds like a troll lol
---
Meg with red sweatpants and crop top. 
---
Plague has Entirty steroids 
---
the whole reason why i bought the new survivor
---
When everyone is in the same rank, does it even matter?  I for one am just happy I'm in the same queue with mediocre survivors AND pro survivors instead of just pro try hard survivors like last ranked system.
---
Legion with Iridescent Button addon and duration addon.
---
Unnerving Presence - Overwhelming Presence - Coulrophobia - Ruin
---
Is it supposed to be moving (like a gif?) I don’t see any movement like a gif would make. 
---
Nope, the 4k used to guarantee Iridescent. 
---
Huntress is far more balanced.
---
She has a strong ability to end chases (her hatchets) but the strength of attacking at range is offset by several factors:
---
- Aim: It takes a high degree of skill to master her throwing, and without practice she will flail.
---
- Limited Hatchets: On top of aiming, you can't just try again and again, fail and you are harshly limited in a chase.
---
- Movement speed: An important aspect, you must be good at using her power to play her, as her default chasing is hindered. Like other killers that move rapidly or ignore barriers, she is intended to be played around her power, not fall back on basics.
---
That said, when mastered, she can decimate survivors, turning their strongest points on the map into free hits. The only unbalanced part about her is her add ons, mostly the stacking behaviour between iridescent heads and + hatchet add ons.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
In contrast you have Hillbilly.
---
He has a strong ability that end chases incredibly fast, and often has the ability to find and down a survivor in ways that prevent them even reacting before they're lying on their ass.
---
- Aim: Like Huntress he takes aim. Arguably far less practice needs to be put into Hillbilly. Yes, pro players can do exceptional maneuvers through obstacles, but even a new player can fumble through him in a few games and get the basic movement across map down. Unlike Huntress, he has add ons for steering, reducing the skill required to get a handle on him. Nothing makes you aim hatchets better.
---
- No Limit to his power: He has a *very* short cooldown between chainsaws, can use it for potentially infinite duration, infinite times, with no restocking, no actual cooldown meter, just a quick second or two.
---
-  No compensation: Hillbilly comes from the time when all killers were the same speed, and since then they haven't ~~fixed~~ changed that about him. EVERY other killer with mobility, speedy map control, and similar power dynamics is hindered by lowered movement speed. Even Leatherface moves significantly slower revving up the chainsaw. Yet when the chainsaw fails Billy still has the chase speed and capacity of regular M1 killers, when he's revving the chainsaw behind a survivor he loses no ground (and at that point has at LEAST a 50/50 shot to land it) and due to the speed while revving, can often bodyblock survivors entirely and cheese a whole chase.
---
But, like the devs said, they can't nerf Hillbilly because too many people, and too many popular and vocal players, play a lot of Hillbilly, and you can't nerf him without damaging their fragile egos when they can no longer 4k every match without fail with "hurr durr most balanced killer!"
---
Gosh, Herman is way too hot
---
The problem is that he's completely shit when played the way he's intended, he's complete freddy-tier when played like that. Tunneling is the only viable way to play him.
---
How dare you. 
---
&gt;Pallets have been nerfed to the point where there are hardly any left on the map to use, taking hits for other survivors and/or body-blocking doesn't work against NOED unless the totem has been cleansed, Self-Care doesn't matter against NOED and neither does Adrenaline... and also every single one of those things is countered by at least *several* killer perks and/or abilities and most of those mechanisms have been nerfed (ie exhaustion nerf)..
---
Taking hits *doesn't work against NOED*. Adrenaline *doesn't work against NOED*.  Self-care *doesn't work against NOED*.... Okay so if the killer doesn't have NOED... That's three advantages the survivors have over the killer. Immediately. After they've already managed to do the main objective. Your main argument is that there's a killer perk that counters a survivor perk. And to complain about Exhaustion and pallet 'nerfs'... You're not looking for balance. You're looking to have an advantage. You want to ensure you escape 100% of the time. Sure everyone WANTS to win every game, but to say you SHOULD is insanity. A one time NOED is a weaker version of a tier 3 Myers - someone that has NOED built into his kit. I'm guessing you don't much care for him. Also, Leatherface can down 4 survivors at once without a single perk or add-on. Thoughts?
---
&gt; The killer would face camp 
---
New DS counters face campers. Hard. Not to mention, if there's more than one other survivor left, getting past a face camper is easy. Lastly, someone dying at the END of the game doesn't mean you lost. You played through the entire match. You got your points, you got your gameplay - why are you SO upset that the killer got one kill. This is a GAME. Being so upset that the opposing team got any objective even though they clearly lost is just poor sportsmanship. I'm never afraid to sacrifice myself to get someone off the hook from a camping killer. I get rescue points, that guy gets out, and hey maybe some crazy play will happen afterwards. I've done an unbreakable/deliverance/decisive against a camping leatherface and that was one of my most memorable games. I totally died, but all 3 of my teammates got out, even after being downed. I had fun, they had fun, bubba got his one kill. It's whatever.
---
I'm curious... Do you think the hatch is OP? I mean, the amount of times I've been left to die so the immersed Claudette (doing gens, u?) that did nothing all game could take the hatch is annoying. Are they not being given a 'gimmie' for not completing their objective?
---
AS A DOCTOR MAIN I HATE THOSE TYPE OF MY SPECIES WHEN I SEE THEY
---
hmmmm
---
Stun is 3seconds now tho... I was testing the new ds myself and billy had enduring with 75% stun reduction... You do the math... DS is useless as fuk against dat, should be back to 4seconds stun tbh

Hex: Reported for hacking
---
&gt; It is the killers job to kill the survivors as fast as possible. I'm sorry but if the killer manages to kill 2/3 people before they do 2 generators without tunnelling - then that would be fine? Because it would be fine for people games to be cut short if tunnelling isn't involved..?
---
That would be a responsibility of survivors who were outplayed. They had fair play and they've lost it.
---
I don't say I can't understand the reasoning behind tunneling, I'd just say it comes not from rational desire to play optimally, but from feeling that they don't control the game without tunneling. And for me it feels like tunneling is basically the same as learning to run with crutches, you will be to used for it to play efficiently without. Plus you'll screw with others
---
where is that 
---
is that really the entity 
---
Hex: OOF
---
When you are stunned by survivor 5/4/3 times, the perk automatically activates and the survivor drops one health state. When the totem attached to this perk is cleansed, a loud "OOF" noise is played and every survivor has the *Exposed* status effect for 3/4/5 seconds. 
---
*"Oof" -Lost tapes, Roblox Noob*
---
Sigh. No one said I don't help people. That is the key to pipping. Again, watch the opening cutscene. Go look at some stuff the devs themselves have said. This isn't rocket science. 
---
We understood it, it's just that your joke is shite.
---
Same lol
---
Both are tactically sound sure, but tunneling in particular sometimes makes some killers do genuinely stupid things.
---
Like trying to squeeze past a bodyblocker early game instead of smacking them out of the way, trying to wiggle past hook bodyblockers and letting the survivor on their shoulder wiggle free, or a huntress rage-chasing one guy all game with no hatchets and then whining about genrush post-game. 
---
It's like camping really. Makes perfect sense if you see 2 or even 3 survivors hang around the hook, a serious misplay if a killer 5 meter "patrols" with 5 gens up and then keeps doing it when 3 gens pop in unison.
---
We will all be rank 20 soon enough!
---
Except getting the achievement for getting rank 1 with Killer or Survivor is hell now.
---
Ah, I've looked through their post history... you're right, I shouldn't have taken the bait.
---
The clown is really good, but the text is awful. It's 2019, not 2012. 
---
Same. I care about the blood points only.
---
I made quick runs back and forth to the last three generators checking to see if the last survivor was working on them multiple times but all they wanted to do was get their friend up. Torwards the last sliver of health the downed survivor had I did wait around a lil bit but not more than 10 seconds. Claimed I was body blocking because the downed survivor kept crawling underneath me. If they were smart they would've did the generators or looked for the hatch. 
---
Yeah i cant help it if the killer chases a survivor for a long time and me and the other 2 finish 3 seperate gens before he downs the one honestly
---
and they in fact were swf not randoms
---
They can downvote you all they want, but the devs already said they're not changing it. The little bitches here are gonna have to learn to deal.
---
This thread has been up for a long while so there's a good chance no one will see this but if someone/OP does let me know if this is reasonable:
---
Gen Rushing is when, as a survivor, you ignore other important objectives, like rescuing a downed/hooked survivor, healing yourself to full-health when hurt, or (arguably) seeking and destroying Hex totems in favor of remaining on a gen. Essentially, prioritizing generator progress when a second more time-sensitive objective arises.
---
Can’t even be mad
---
fuck this is already in my head with all the killers dancing to bugs and problems oh fuck
---
Is it just me, or did they fix it already? I've been pipping like normal, but I haven't gotten back up to rank 1 yet since the rank reset, so maybe it's tougher in the red ranks?
---
??? theyre different, not only reffering to gameplay but also stats, shes taller and faster and theyre abilities are pretty different, looks like you got ptsd from playing against legion
---
Actually getting a mori with it. The hard part is not getting to 5 stacks and having it break mid chase with someone right as you're about to get them.
---
I tried to this gif file on reddit but didn’t work, so I post my blog link. Hopefully you would enjoy this moving fan art!

I love it. Title makes it perfect lol

How bout camping??

what do you mean report their message? Like report them through psn messenger?

That's how they do it in Apex and it seems to be working fine for them.

"there are survivors on the map."
---
Getting adrenaline to pop a millisecond after Michael hits you in tier 3 but you're not worried because tier 3 just ended 
---
Noed is one of those things that fun to use but not play against. I think it needs to be reworked or changed.
---
4 dead survivors 
---
Trully a horror game now 
---
Because some killers have a very difficult time applying gen pressure, out of mobility issues or a weaker power. And for those killers, NOED can even the odds toward the endgame.
---
Additionally, everyone and their grandma seems to be running adrenaline these days, which makes NOED even more appealing.
---
The opening cutscene is irrelevant and doesn't change anything about the fact that you would be a pain to play with. 
---
Wow... I knew Adiris was tall, but not THAT tall!
---
The what? 
---
I wouldn't really call those "advantages over the killer" so much as.. strategies? Since, you know, the killer can *hit you and down you* if you body block or take hits, and several killers have one-hit downs as well. Self-Care I am not going to start with as it is a perk that exists for the purpose of helping the survivor, you might as well complain that any killer perk at all gives killers an advantage since it makes it easier for the killer to find/down/whatever survivors.
---
&gt;Your main argument is that there's a killer perk that counters a survivor perk.
---
No, my main argument is that NOED in its current form is unfair to survivors and rewards bad play from the killer. Just like how killer players always complained that DS pre-nerf gave survivors a "free escape" and rewarded bad play from survivors.
---
&gt;You're not looking for balance. You're looking to have an advantage. You want to ensure you escape 100% of the time.
---
All this language, so biased... I think it's so funny how people always assume that because I want the game to be fair and not biased against survivors all the time and giving killers automatic 4ks every game I must only play survivor lol.. "You" "you" "you"...
---
I play mostly killer. But go off I guess? p: Make yourself look silly and biased just like you have been this whole time...
---
Anyway, your scare quotes around "nerfs" is ridiculous since if you try to claim those weren't nerfs and severe ones you're literally lying... and you can't balance a game by nerfing one side (survivors) into the ground while continuously buffing the other side (killers) and making the game way too easy for them, but I guess that's the kind of "balance" you love and appreciate. But you claim you're not biased against survivors lol... okay.
---
&gt;Thoughts?
---
Killer abilities are specifically designed with limitations and differences... automatic one-use NOED for every single killer with no drawbacks, no need to do anything to earn your one-shot or anything. Leatherface's chainsaw is powerful but requires a charge, is unwieldy, and has a short range. Myers' EW3 requires an extensive charge up time that can only be accomplished by staring at survivors when they don't notice and hide from him and only lasts for a specific short amount of time (without add-ons anyway). Automatic one-shot NOED for every killer would have no drawbacks or conditions.
---
(And to be contrary, I'll point out that the same is true for pretty much all survivor perks... Self-Care allows the survivor to heal themselves without a Med-Kit, but it takes a significantly longer amount of time to do it (the drawback). Sprint Burst gives the survivor a burst of speed, but they can't run at all without activating it and it has a very long recharge time which, after the exhaustion nerf, won't recharge while running (drawbacks). That's why these skills and the killer abilities are viable in the game - they have drawbacks, limitations and/or complications that make using them a skill, not just a "gimme".)
---
&gt;New DS counters face campers. Hard.
---
It doesn't at all. Someone just posted a video today showing that if a survivor is rescued off the hook and downed immediately, with new DS they can still be put right on the hook with no chance to use the perk. And if the killer is running Enduring, the survivor can't even get off the killer's shoulder before the stun is over and the killer can just knock them back down. Even without Enduring, the stun is so short that a survivor can't even get over a nearby pallet before the killer can hit them again. The perk is literally useless now against *any* killer.
---
Not to mention that most face campers will just pull a rescuing survivor off before they can accomplish the rescue and then drop them... they usually don't allow the unhook to actually take place.
---
&gt;You got your points, you got your gameplay - why are you SO upset that the killer got one kill.
---
I'm not upset that the killer "got one kill", I'm upset that you're talking about **handing the killer a kill**. If the killer outplays me at the end and kills me? Good for them! I don't care. Winning or losing doesn't really interest me so much as having a fun and interesting game while I'm in it. But if the killer scams a kill because the game took pity on them and gave them a freebie, of course I'm going to be frustrated and upset - they didn't outplay me, they didn't legitimately earn that kill, they were *handed* that kill by a bad mechanic that shouldn't be in the game at all. It removes skill from the equation which is unfair and not right.
---
&gt;Being so upset that the opposing team got any objective even though they clearly lost is just poor sportsmanship.
---
No, it's called wanting the game to be fair. If you were playing a sports game and a team that got no points and played terribly through the whole game was allowed at the end to take as many free shots as necessary to give them more points than the opposing team (who scored and played well the whole game) and give them the win, you'd object, right? Or would it be "poor sportsmanship" to think that's BS?
---
&gt;Are they not being given a 'gimmie' for not completing their objective?
---
No, the hatch is a last chance for a survivor to escape. It's comparable on the killer's side to the time it takes the exit gates to open which allows the killer a last chance to grab the survivor off the door and hook them even if they haven't gotten any hooks yet.
---
Michael trying to get that tier3 mori all survivors achievement but couldn't find any survivors: :'(
---
I voted Huntress. 
---
And the moment you wanna start the actual mori -BOOM-
---
Now that ranking doesn't matter, people have less reason to care about losing 2 pips by disconnecting. Hence why disconnects seem to be up.
---
Nobody likes a camper and camping is the only logical reason anyone would play LF 
---
There are currently 15 Killers in the game, 18 if you consider that the Legion is comprised of 4 members, being them Frank, Julie, Susie and Joey. So knowing that here all of the Killers were changed for just The Legion and knowing that the Legion are actually 4 different people, then 15 x 4 = 60. So there would be 60 ''Killers'', them being comprised of 15 Franks, 15 Julies, 15 Susies and 15 Joeys. Imagine how that would be.
---
When your girlfriend leaves you for someone else who's better than you so you get really salty and defensive :) 
---
Oh, yeah. The Emblem got changed though 
---
Fun fact: trapper is called hunter in the portuguese translation lmao
---
It should award more given how rare it is. I'm glad they changed the daily, though... (shivers) 
---
I’m guilty
---
Except it does, it's the reason why I'm playing with people who are too scared/new at the game to rescue even though I run kindred III. I'm also destroying killers looping them for ages but not pipping fast enough cause of the changes.
---
Saying "You know what? I'm about to say it" doesn't make what you're about to say true, you just sound like an edgelord lmao.
---
TL;DR: It does matter and affects your experience, no one said anything about rewards.
---
Quentin is secretly Michael Myers 
---
NOOB HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO REPORT SOMEONE
---
When you personally attack someone about their private life on social media because they didn't like your meme so now you're salty and can't come up with a better insult than to insult their releationship you have no business in.
---
That's really sad hahahaha get NOGGED on 
---
Haha, my cake day was actually on the 8Th this month. I just messed up somehow when making the account but thanks! 
---
I was in a chase and as the killer was swinging haunted grounds was cleansed. I was instadowned then adrenaline brought me up.
---
why is a girl cosplaying as male character?
---
I don't even know if someone else has done this. I was expecting it!
---
Shhh...don't tell anyone.
---
I main killer, so this system sometimes allows me to just dick around and toy with survivors instead of constantly being forced to try hard and run meta perks.  I can try hard if I want, but that's what I've been forced to do for the past year and a half, so this is kind of refreshing.  I can see how it would be frustrating as a survivor though.
---
Quinten is a killer confirmed 
---
When you act like the victim even though you're the one who commented on their very beautiful meme that took their friend a very long time to make and pretend you didn't just insult them in your original reply.

He hangs out in Nea's basement. 
---
For the most part I don't care about rank. But getting blood points is alot easier if you don't get paired with rank 17 survivors with 2 perks. 
---
He wasn’t using scratched mirror. He was just a baby
---
Agreed
---
you can report them on their profile, at least on xbox
---
People tend to DC cause they suspect a camp

Try updating your gpu drivers and if that doesn’t work try verifying the game cache

No its not bannable to slug and camp the slug
---
She played over 3700 hours in this game :D
---
TOTEMS ARE MY JAM FAM
---
More like, no
---
Decisives trigger requirements post rework are great.  No problem with that.  It's fair now.  I'd run it myself now that it punishes tunnelers if only it had a useful stun duration.  3 seconds is worthless.  That was decisive 1 pre change which allows killers to get right back on you too quickly.  If they are one of the multitudes of killers running Enduring.  It is literally worthless, you couldn't get away fast enough if you wanted to.  They'll be chasing you as you hit the ground lol.  
---
He is suggesting NOED down as base for every killer which is literally the last thing this game needs.  One of the craziest things I've ever seen on the sub to be honest with you.  It's just very tone deaf in regards to the current balance killers are enjoying currently.  
---
I'M ONLY PIPPING WHEN I 4K AS NURSE, EVEN ONE DC SHAFTS IT ALL TO HELL
---
Doing gens and leaving is definitely a sign of skill. 
---
And 3650 of that was afk? 
---
Reason for rank is not for rewards, its for more fair games. Also its more fun to play a game with a working ladder
---
Oh really? i've been running meme perks and hitting rank 1 with ease every month since the emblem system on both killer and survivor. It was never a challenge in any way to get rank 1.
---
Yeah, finishing chases quick gets rewarded?
---
Instadowns are not rewarded that well i guess, which i think they should change so Hillbilly and Myers T3 gets rewarded, but Noed etc. instadowns does not.
---
Having survivors die on first or second hook gets punished, since you don't get the full points.
---
And i do agree (i guess i didn't specify) that it needs tweaking, since it is a bit too much on the impossible side.
---
But at the same time, i kinda like the idea of having a proper rank system where a large portion of the community will never get to rank 1. 
---
Let me also explain the reason i don't believe rank 1 rewards would be a good idea.
---
Think of how annoying Ruin, Noed, old DS, insta heals, etc. are.. Then imagine if people actually had a reason to grind rank 1.
---
Every single match would be Ebony mori, Ruin, Noed, Nurse vs. 4 man SWF with insta medkits and any perk you hate going against.
---
All that try harding and toxicity would not be healthy for the community imo, and some skin reward wouldn't make up for that.
---
I will downvote if you DONT facecamp me
---
Being a battle Royale, that's a whole different story.
---
That is even that bad ive been getting rank 15s all day
---
"That's not a woman, that's a tree"
---
Here’s the Myers build I use and get 4K’s consistently: 
---
Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and M&amp;A
---
WHY DO SURVIVORS GET TO RUN AROUND IN 3RD PERSON ALL GAME EVERY GAME ABLE TO USE 360 DEGREES OF VISION AND AN ARRAY OF COMUNICATION APPS AND PROGRAMES BUT KILLERS ARE FORCED TO BE IN FIRST PERSON THE WHOLE TIME???!!! WE STILL DONT HAVE A MULTI KILLER MODE!!
---
Ummm... Okay? Any particular reason for that? And any particular reason that you felt the need to announce it to the world? You could have easily just done so quietly and nobody would ever have known.
---
Make DC through the menu cost 10k BP. If someone is experiencing a glitch or the issues you mentioned, they can DC by closing the application, or send in a ticket to get their 10k BP back. Also DC on the hook should count as a sacrifice for the killer. I came imagine someone complaining about these changes, as it should be a net positive for everyone's experience. 
---
Yeah I agree. I look at their health and how much more gen I need. If i think I can make it, then I'm finishing the gen. Seems like more recently though, people are letting themselves die while being initially hooked or just DC'ing. So, for that reason, I'm more likely to try finishing a gen. 
---
Awesome sauce! I would've went on but it was almost 1 In the morning for me and I wanted to sleep lol
---
Ohh, well then lets call it a draw

THEY RUINED SPIRIT. I CANT HEAR SHIT ANYMORE EXCEPT GLASS SHATTERING. WHAT THE FUCK.

what about playing DBD to trigger some frustrated manchilds as killer?

Why, thank you.

That's a flaw of the game design then, isn't it? If everyone trying their hardest to win breaks the game, then you've designed a bad game.
---
I didn't edit the six new perks, there should be nothing wrong with them. When you mean open you mean the png files directly right?
---
Thye need to make the spawns more uniform tho, sometimes they beside a random tree no one checks and sometimes they are beside the gen in the main building
---
I dont know if i even WANT to reach rank 1
---
Okay but then he is still able to spear them.
---
Playing DBD for the cancer 🔥👌😫👌💦💯
---
Why am I Dead Hard
---
Yeah it still counts as a mori kill though I’m pretty sure. I agree though, when you get punished for kills it’s bollocks.
---
Stay away from my hooks.
---
Rochester! 
---
 🦀 Twitter is not your customer service 🦀 
---
It probably has a legitimate reason, such as prioritizing the killer’s who queued up before you and we’re thus waiting longer. I’ve got no clue though, but honestly seven minutes is nothing. Swf on ps4 would take 45 minutes and I’m not even exaggerating.
---
What the hell is that wraith build, other than nothing. 
---
The beam-meme build. Really you just need a map and that glass bead offering. Put the marker down in front of a locker and get inside. When a survivor comes to check it out, jump out of the locker, throw out a quick T-bag and run away.
---
They're in random static locations. They will be found regardless. It is a risk to run them. You have great games and you have games they're found right away. Experienced people run and check the static spots.
---
Just utilize them while you can and when they break it's fine. I've never understood people giving up when they lose a hex. If you're that bad that a hex is carrying you try to just get better.
---
Sure the survivors starting next to them during spawns was bad but they fixed that. We dont need to hear about this anymore. It is not wrong and its not broken. Totems are fine. Run the new plague perk if you dont like ruin getting destroyed.
---
Local chili boi goes on rampage... 
---
no survivors
---
I play for Kate's bare hips
---
This is neat. Good work!
---
It's fine this was happening with some of the other perks before as well. They ended up working just fine so I'll test these and hopefully there won't be any problems.
---
Hitting the last survivor isn’t the same thing at all though. Teabagging at the gate = prolonging the game and gloating after you’ve already won, forcing the killer to waste their own time to hit you out. Hitting the last survivor=just trying not to be bored while they get struggle points. Hardly on the same level of BM.
---
*Alyssa Edwards’ voice* BEAST!
---
Hiding might get you survive for longer, but you achieve nothing from it that is worth something. You will get while playing when to hide, and when don't.
---
Yes, main objective is to fix generators and buy as much time as you can, when killer is chasing you for your team to fix generators.
---
You can see generators by their lights, if you play in outside maps, they are tall. If you play inside map, sorry, even people who plays for 100h have trouble finding them :)
---
Yea, gen spawn location as is everything else is a bit randomized, but they usually spawn in the same locations. You will learn those locations while playing.
---
Nice cosplay but nb likes jake
---
I've done this only once. A couple hours ago. I'm sorry.
---
idk how it would be coded but I mean make it so that rancor bascaly scans your perks and if it doesn't detect an obsession related one (DS/OoO/SS) then the exposed/mori part wont take effect
---
the info related parts of the perk would function as normal
---
Matchmaking? Does that exist? Can you eat that? 
---
Feels like playing Apex, matchmaking its unexistent and that impacts directly in my playing experience, making it a pain in the ass and boring. Getting smacked over and over is only fun when you are a masochist.
---
10/10 sabotaged hooks
---
I would say it doesn't reward them for losing five gens. rather it gives them a second chance so they can still get a few bps. I'm a person who thinks decisive before the nerf and Noed are just good perks that will help and give you a second chance if you made a big mistake.
---
Thanks!

**cough** *all exhaustion perks*  **cough**
---
I'm very confused why you're using tournaments as the basis to judge the games meta.  Makes no sense.  This game is a laughingstock when looking at their tournaments.  They have been bungled shitshows in the past because there isn't a good way to score the teams against each other in competitive play.  Hence why camping can win tournaments despite the other killer outplaying the team hard because the camper denied points to the other team.  Use the actual game itself when analyzing meta.  If you do you'll find camping is literally the least efficient way to play killer.  Camping results in horrible bloodpoints do devs are telling you something in that metric.  Don't care about bloodpoints?  Let's look at ranking up.  Camping is easily the least efficient way to secure a pip especially with the new system.  So the devs are telling you that in terms of ranked play and matchmaking that camping is also a subpar strat.  The game is actively taking a stand against camping.  It is telling you hey you can do it but we are going to penalize you in every metric if you do.  They're trying to tell you something.
---
&gt;Teabagging at the gate = prolonging the game 
---
Not always, sometimes the killer is right behined you, you are about to escape and you T-bag and leave before he can get you.
---
&gt;gloating after you’ve already won
---
What do you think hitting a hooked survivor means?
---
&gt;Hitting the last survivor=just trying not to be bored while they get struggle points
---
If you don't want to be bored, go around the map and break some pallets. Anything you do ks better than hitting the hooked survivor
---
Her height was the inspiration for this.

And uh, before anyone asks for sauce: &gt;!Alice Merchesi and Lauren Phillips!&lt;
---
what's the song? it sounds very familiar
---
Found the cunt that facecamps on first hook then complains when 4 gens activate
---
Wow what a great attitude, I definitely don’t feel any sort of guilt for telling you outright it was shit, you may have done it for ‘fun’ but it’s no excuse for wooden, stilted dialogue and terrible world building and an overall lack of any original thought, imagination or even talent.

*You nerfed my only meta perk, now im going to* **starve**
---
unlike killers survivors have zero restriction on the good perks they can run, literally just adapt and try something else
---
Something g like this would take a skilled writer less than a few days to churn out, it’s that bad
---
pretty typical for those people with "dots" for names, I know their game and why they do that.  they are scum
---
I agree. I don't get the reasoning that it "awards for failing". It is more of a second wind perk, because it gives you an edge during the endgame. I also agree that DS didn't need a nerf. They were both pretty good perks.
---
45 minutes?  good lord, I would give up on any game where I need to wait over 5 minutes to play.  There is no excuse, well maybe if the game was dead and had no players.
---
Eyyyy I already follow you on insta, you make such a good Jake!
---
So? Adrenaline gives you a speed boost and heals you and wakes you up. Even if you didn't touch a single generator. That's also an easy second chance for a survivor.
---
Just like decisive strike was before the nerf. That doesn't make these things "crutches", they're second wind perks, yes, but a crutch implies that you can't win without them, which simply isn't true. 
---
Big mad lol
---
It would be a good strategy, however the fountains when all corrupted go back to normal and the plague automatically gets corrupt purge, so she can’t do that
---
Don't forget about the Legion 
---
I thought you were holding a burrito at first.
---
Here are the reasons:
---
1. Frank's mixtape
---
2. People DC against him 24 7
---
3. He breaks fundamental mechanics of the game. Survivors are supposed to use windows and pallets to gain distance between them and the killer. Legion completely disregards this. Nurse does as well but nurse gets punished harshly if she messes up(long ass fatigue time). Legion doesn't have any punishment for messing up in the chase.
---
“Was it easy for you?” * no reply* xD

She is by a fair bit, she's the tallest in game currently. Check my posts (I can't link from mobile) you'll see the tallest killers one there. 👌🏻
---
As swf?
---
Huh... Ya know, I have to completely agree with the Leatherface being F tier. Everytime I see a Leatherface, they are only playing them for the perks. Hell, only BBQ and Chili sometimes. I rarely see a Leatherface use their power, and when they do, it's easy to avoid if you're on a close map like Gideon Meat Plant. 
---
Funny enough, an interesting change to see Freddy not at the bottom anymore. Though, he probably is just as bad, if not worse, than Leatherface. 
---
Pretty good list dude. 
---
Then you're the god of the universe.
---
I wonder, maybe get a cheap chainsaw and remove the chain for a better chainsaw if your current one got a little broke at Halloween? (I don't know how much chainsaws are, so sorry if it's a stupid idea haha)
---
They just need to nerf NOED and put in a mandatory secondary objective, because all that the devs did with the NOED changes is make people angry that “killers get rewarded for bad plays” instead of successfully finding a way to prolong matches in a healthy way. 
---
Gens aren’t the only intended objective, you’re a survivor not a mechanic. Totems are SUPPOSED to be a secondary objective, but they just straight up changed things without telling the community how they intended the changes to affect the meta. I love the devs and they’re heading in the right direction but man do they struggle with communication 
---
Take responsablitlity for  actions and eventually improve? Fuck that, I'm going to keep blaming others.

*insert spirit pallet stun noise followed by spirit fucking off to somewhere else*
---
Being within radius for 15 seconds without being in a chase is a pretty demanding requirement. The 15 seconds I spend risking being around and chasing the killer could be time spent working on a gen away from the killer. Yes, there are times where you are within the radius while working on a gen, but those are too rare, and when they do come up, 15 seconds is too long to make a real difference. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, not so much. If they took off the "not being chased" requirement, then it would be an amazing perk.
---
Only the best killers for this video. 
---
*mommies and daddies as far as the eye can see*
---

---
Niceee. good spot
---
u get a little better teammates, that can probably run the killer more than 10 seconds.
---
David with red sweatpants and *no* top.
---
xD
---
True , but as a killer is totally useless to rank up sadly.
---
Weird are you EU or US? 
---
Someone's probably put a spreadsheet out somewhere, but the info about gen repair with toolboxes is mostly on the [toolbox](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Toolboxes) page.
---
So far as shape and stuff like that, i'm not actually sure. People have been wanting clearer indicators for ages, but the devs seem to like their moderately/considerably/tremendously ambiguity. 
---
Clearly I am. I'm not a great killer but when I can't make a kill at rank 14 after 2.8k hours I have to feel like its not me. I gave up on nurse and  huntress(because I struggle to 2k with them)now looks like plague is a gonna be a hard pass for me too. 2.8k hrs with a handful of dcs.All against legion or as plague. Im very displeased with both recent killers. I've played 5 games as plague and dcd 2 of them very not my style but its such a pain to see 4 direct hits with corrupt purge miss over a pallet.
---
US
---
maybe that’s why
---
I did have a friend saying he couldnt find games,then he tried with me and it was still good
---

---
You will never wait 7mins or 15mins to start the game as a killer.  The wait times for Survivors are dependent on Rank, and SWF group sizes.  Most SWF groups are 2 or 3 so then you are looking to fill them in your criteria.    At least now we get so see wait times. and everyone needs to play more killer 
---
Well put.
---
Thats dope
---
Last night was just awful.  I played for two hours I got 4 3-survivor lobbies in a row. One as killer, 3 as survivor.  Two others. Of maybe 8-10 matches I played, 3 of them had full teams. This latest patch is terrible.
---
I disagree on the plague's placement. In the right hands she's extremely powerful. More so than the huntress (at least on console). 
---
It's always been that way for me so I didn't even know the pig used to be able to see them lol 
---
tnk you i am going to save
---
ok i am going to save
---
Play a legit killer that needs skill?
---
Last night I was with some buddies playing survive with friends and the killer killed one of us, getting like 5k bp and my buddy that did two whole gens and opened the gate and escaped got the same amount lol. It’s like they don’t reward you for escaping anymore 
---
The video won’t load, can someone describe it for me?
---
I’m rank 12. Yesterday I unhooked every single one of my teammates, did 4/5 gems, won the majority of my chases, but got got hooked and died towards the end of the match.
---
Depipped. 
---
Yea, I could. Maybe something like:
---
"You have to be joking, there's no way someone can be this stupid. The title literally refers to a singular survivor and a group of killers, and the picture shows one person against a group. You should have been able to figure this out given the context".
---
I'd say hat would have been a lot more condescending.
---
I wasn't even being condescending, I was asking a legitimate question, you're just too sensitive.
---
I only ever sudoku on hook if I'm playing against a plague or legion who tunnels or if I'm letting someone get the hatch.
---
Yea tbh I thought the same thing and was very confused when I read the achieve description. My bad :). That’s way too hard for killers now 
---
I'm fine with with everything in the rank system, except for how high of a requirement is needed for safety pipping.
---
It’s not scummy there’s no other way to counter it, smart survivors would’ve seen you patrolling it and worked on gens 
---
Curious as to what perks? I’m assuming adrenaline, right? 
---
I got mine back in a few days

Since the 2.6.0 patch I have not been able to play any full matches. If I go in a survivor I will DC randomly midway through the match. Majority of the time it has been when starting an action of any sort including healing, unhooking, repairing. A few times it has happened just while running. Playing SWF has confirmed that I am the only one being kicked and that the game is still going.
---
When playing as the killer, I will get a minimum of 2 people to disconnect from me. Sometimes at least 3 or all 4. It happens randomly in the middle of the match. SWF groups have confirmed their friends did not DC on purpose.
---
I have tried everything I can to resolve this issue. I have seen your issue resolving document and tried all items on there. I have verified files. Switched hard drives. Re-installed DX. Rebooted internet. Turned off all overlays. Updated all Windows, hardware,  and device drivers. Nothing has been successful.
---
I have only seen a handful of similar reports but the reports I saw confirmed that it is the exact same for them. At the moment it is impossible to play the game as I cant stay in long enough to rank and keep de-ranking because of it.
---
I can confirm that the game worked flawlessly before the update.
---
I think the rework is great, its basically Borrowed Time for yourself, once per game. The issue is the stun time isnt long enough/affected by Enduring. The fact Enduring completely neutralizes it is unfortunate and hopefully sometime the Devs will change. 
---
Hook vacuum needs to go other than that Ive learned even being downed 30 secs into a game is not ALWAYS an immediate death or bad game. Mostly yes but not always. 
---
It's punishment because the survivors get way better and the queue times get way worse.
---
Finding about ash I've been watching the Netflix one 
---
It was ez to die, yes 
---
I mean, you're teammates regardless of how you frame it. You wouldn't win a 1v1.
---
I was about to comment something snarky then I saw you got pissed over the emblems changes, understandable 
---
Eh differnce is the temple has pallets and a lot of moving space. You can just run them around down there and then come up aftrr a pallet stun and thr upstairs of the temple is a godsend bc of all the windows. If you have BL I wish the killer luck. It also seems like the map has pallets everywhere so even if you do take a hit coming out of temple basement you can run anywhere and pretty much be safe

Platform: Pc
---
Type of bug: Visual
---
Description: No one in game could see progression on people who were hooked, it stayed completely full until you died.
---
Steps to reproduce: have been completely unable to reproduce, however the game was against a pig. No idea what caused the bug.
---
Removing feral frenzy would just make legion useless garbage, it just needs to be tweaked.
---
They just need to make it that we cant moonwalk as legion, and that each time you recharge frenzy by hitting a survivor the time it lasts reduces by 25% or something, so they cant easily wound all 4 survivors with one frenzy.  Also frenzy should probably take about 50% longer to charge, and potentially take even longer to charge based on how long you were in frenzy (how many times it triggered), so if you hit frenzy 3 times and wounded 3 survivors, maybe you cant use it again for 45 seconds or so instead of the current 10-15 second recharge.

I never realized doctor was the tallest killer until plague, always thought it was wraith. I think he has the tallest first person stance too in treatment mode.
---
Same power, they just made her set traps much quicker (used to take 3 seconds, now it's just over 2) and removed the downsides from her add-ons. She also received a few buffs before that major one, like decreasing her terror radius (used to be 28m) and increasing the base range she can teleport to her traps (used to be 32m, now 40m)
---
demise of the faithful be like
---
Yeah. Then a trapper stood with me on his shoulder to get an upskirt. Sent me a message ahead of time.
---

---
Bros in dbd need ta get laid.
---
What about the DLC is there something I should get in the beginning?
---
It's a strat that comes with it's own risks. The benefits are that it disorientates and tilts the killer and drags the game into your favour but the risks are that one person is often sacrificed to do it, the threat of NOED is real and the new pip system will really fuck you over if you don't complete it's arbitrary checklist. 
---
If I'm in a team that's genrushing, you can bet I'm gonna go on the hunt for totems. 
---
oh YES
---
I'm mostly against it for the sake of new/bad players. They don't deserve to get stomped that hard :(
---
I've just felt bad the last couple games as killer, cause even though i'm just playing wraith for funsies i'm clearly matching against new people, since only 2 survivors in 3 games had a full set of perks even.
---
Hag struggles on really big maps with spread out gens as she can't control an area as well with her traps.
---
That said, I don't think Coldwind is too bad for her. The only map I would say is truly an issue is Temple of Purgation, because there's like 60m between gens lol.
---
The sad thing is that thanks to Streamers like Ochido you don't know if you're talking to grown adults or kids. Entity knows Chris Hansen doesn't care if you made a mistake.
---
I do mean seppuku but it's a meme to call it sudoku. 
---
She can tunnel better than pretty much any other killer. She follows you getting you broken and then instantly downing you. Whilst corrupt she essentially turns into a ranged Cannibal when it comes to camping.
---
Then there's ruin, corrupt and thrill of the hunt... Yeah. I really don't like playing against her.
---
Yes but then he doesnt have any extra movement speed
---
Run looks so cute here
---
Eh, Cannible isn't great, but he does have an ability and I wouldn't put him below Freddy. You can hit people running around scenery tightly, it's just not super easy to do. He also has the delightful niche of punishing overly altruistic plays and he makes the basement uniquely difficult.
---
Unlike Freddy he can actually guard hooks and totems and properly pressure generators. Basically, Freddy won't ever be higher than anyone else tier wise as long as he has to wait 7 seconds to do what comes naturally to literally every other killer. 
---
He didn't say anything super weird just "can I down you and pick you up for a screenshot."
---
I was like okay.
---
After. "TY wanted that upskirt on jane."

Red Ranked survivors who care about their rank are not playing until their are adjustments to the ranking system. The ones that did care but want to still play are now level 5+.  
---
This will probably be the way it goes until rank decay.   
---
As far as i know obsession is only for perks and there is only a obsession if someone has a perk for it 
---
Well they were good weren’t they?
---
&gt;Right I don’t care google exists.
---
"Hell to the naw, to the naw, naw, naw."
---
As a solo survivor, I might stay on the hook if anyone ever came for me. Trash SWF only give a shit if it is one of their friends on the hook.  I can see you ignoring me or deciding its okay to unhook in front of the killer to give your group extra time because fuck the solo guy.   
---
Would suicide again.  No Ragerts.

I did not expect this to get 220+ upvotes.

I really didn't think about it because it was a farm game.

Quick someone get the missle toe
---
me neither tf
---
I mean, what makes any killer "good" is their ability, if you just made him a "normal" killer with his only special bonus being that he can vault pallets sometimes, he would instantly become bottom tier and  people would just unlock his perks for other killers and forget about him.  Nurse and billy are already god tier at ignoring pallets, and bamboozle is already a decent vaulting perk that any killer can have.   I really think the vaulting ability would just fall by the wayside and he wouldn't be played.
---
I think the only real option here is making feral frenzy less powerful if we want legion to stay a viable character - because as a killer main I actually really do enjoy playing him
---
Look like youre about to drop a hot mix.
---
Why can't folks just keep their lewdness to themselves?
---
Legion=dc
---
Yes, M&amp;A does keep the bigger terror radius for a split second after you down someone.

Your hair is amazing and it's like mine and that if you could gimme them clothes I could be almost simailr

The blood is spot on and just ughhh I wish I could give you gold but I'm poor ;c

I usually two hook people, never tunnel or camp, not enough for a pip :/
---
"Fix your fucking game... devs."

Every damn survivor deserves facecamp kappa
---
Someone's got to pay for his haircut.
---
If I had fun during the match and racked up some bp I'll consider it a personal win, honestly 
---
That one isn't my picture actually but when the DH bug was happening i did get an insane stack but i played it like 1 hook = 1 stack. Otherwise i could've just insta-down-mori'd everyone after the first hook lol.
---
yup. it's the 80's themed one with the fanny pack
---
true...
---
If i wasn't so lazy i would've made a shitpost about it lol.
---
as he should be
---
That's one hell of a thunderstorm 
---
The heart sees what it wants to see
---
Here’s my best understanding. 
---
As you play and do various actions, you will receive emblem points in various categories. Survivors have Objective, Survival, Altruisim, and Boldness. Killers have Brutality, Deviousness, Sacrifice, and Hunting. After a match those emblem points are tallied up and depending on rank and number of Emblem points, you either get either -1, +/-0, +1, or +2 pips. Every few pips received results in a rankup, from say 8 to 7.
---
DH is stacked by unhooks. As killer, you simply hook people and allow them to get rescued when you are 24+ meters away. If you are too close to the hook, you will not get a stack. If you are far away enough each rescue will get you a token, indicates by a sound cue and a counter on the perk icon. 2 tokens affect your movement speed I believe while 3 cause players to be exposed (instadownable) and 5 allows you to kill survivors by hand. 
---
Obsessions are in play if the killer or any survivor runs an obsession perk of any kind. If no obsession perks are run, there will be no obsession. If the killer is the only one running one, a random survivor is chosen. If a single survivor runs one, they will be the obsession. If multiple survivors run obsession perks, a random survivor is chosen among them to be the obsession. 
---
just play for fun then,  I play with the attitude of zero fucks given, its great and refreshing
---
FFFFF
---
I came my pants
---
Getting enough bloodpoints, getting 4 stacks for BBQ
---
Ohhhhh okay, I wasn’t sure if you meant that it happened  to you mid- match or not haha. But at that point, just let the killer kill me at that point lol, not to mention that it was a 2v1, but yeah it was really odd and messed up chasing and looping haha 
---
At the moment i just steamroll people and let everyone escape, i'm not going to pip anyways and people have been appreciating my friendly gesture :)
---
Fountain DING can be heard even after you've died.
---
Game still hangs until someone leaves (3 people games)
---
Match making put all sorts of ranks together.
---
The pip system is crazy bad now. 
---
PC
---
Getting the safety pip at least, and maybe not dying instantly when trying to loop
---
Bloodlusting the godpallet? I'd like to see that
---
I see your temple picture and raise you mine: 
---
Warning: earrape at some bits
---
Yeah when this happens to me I just try my best to get out in to the open so I can drop my item where people will see it and wait for the killer to come down me. I stopped playing survivor because it's happening so frequently. Will be playing that killer and I will not be using that perk until I see a change 
---
no, its the match making.  Its a joke, and I have honestly never seen its this slow and ive been playing since 2016.  As a results, I am playing the game less and less.  If they wanted to kill the game, they found a great way to do it.
---
Why are dots their names?
---
I see your temple picture, and raise you my Plague picture!

Thank you! I'm just drawing whoever I feel at the moment to keep consistent! I may draw those two in future as I love them dearly. &lt;3
---
There's a version of that perk called"I like it hard and fast." asdgfhjjkl 
---
i main billy and pretty much 3 hook everyone, have no problem double piping often tbh unless it's a 3 man game, or people suicide on hook. when i play survivor tho, in 30 games to give or take i piped up .... once. 20k+ pts, safety pip. it's insane. 
---
&gt;Played on and off for a year and have no clue still.
---
perfect
---
Which perk might that be? But I don’t blame you. I played a handful of matches last night, and more since the update came out, and that was the only time it happened to me so far, so hopefully it’s a very rare bug (unfortunate that it’s been happening to you so frequently though)
---
What else is there to do besides generators and looping though? They should have added more objectives first rather than changing the ranking system because this game gets increasingly boring every update.
---
Why do you have 3 little ping numbers to the side of your screen?
---
Also, nice.
---
👆 What this guy said, it works
---
From what I'm reading it's caused by the new perk that has the entity blocking off select generators from a duration at the beginning of the match

The thing is that without Frank's or moonwalking Legion already isn't that powerful. Outright nerfing them would make them redundant.
---
Bitch Move
---
You don't get it.
---
It's not about "buhuu, I am red ranks, I am sooooo much better"...
---
It's way more about the difficulty level everyone is at, skill-wise.
---
With the rank system it is now, you will get god-like survivors being matched with babykillers and vice versa.
---
This means you will get shit-rounds regularely.
---
How big of a loser you gotta be to care about rank...in DBD xD
---
I voted for Huntress.     
---
Honestly they’re both around the same level but in terms of add-ons I think Billy is just slightly more broken. I know the one shot hatchet might seem better then buffing Billy’s chainsaw but everything to help Billy get around the map easier makes the game a little scarier. Huntress is extremely slow but has a throwing projectile, even if it can one shot you still waste time getting to them.
---
Achievements? Conditions for a merciless victory have been raised therefore they are now harder to get.
---
No one? Ok. r/dbdgonewild
---
If you're gonna repost, you probably shouldn't repost one of the top posts of the month 
---
Such a good idea honestly having to get every perk three times is such a hassle.. that alone would cut grind out dramatically.
---
Lost 30k irdescent shards upvote for notice pls. 
---
Well so is teabagging as survivor 
---
I'd honestly rather get 1-2 survivor kills and depip instead of no kills and a pip.
---
I know the pip is technically the victory condition but personally it doesn't feel like a victory at all unless I get 3-4 kills.  Otherwise it just feels like I lost in my head.

Riveting gameplay..
---
I actually main The Pig and have never used NOED.
---
She should definitely be a 110% speed killer. With 115% she can stay right behind you ready to hit you after you get broken (kinda like a moonwalking Legion except without exploiting game mechanics).
---
As for dodging, it's really inconsistent, I find that sometimes I don't get infected from what looks like it hit me but I get infected from it being a few feet away from me so it's very hard to judge where you should be to dodge it. Hopefully dedicated servers might fix this. 
---
I always seem to get broken very quickly and its definitely busted that your infection goes up whilst in a chase. Changing that alone would fix a lot of issues with Plague (whilst also making the toxic ones moonwalk like Legion...)
---
Whenever I play Plague I always play "Plague Blossom" from Plague Inc. in the background.

So even BHVR can't escape the Battle Royale craze

Hooking everyone at least twice and one dead

As a killer main, I only camp teabagging douchebags. If everyone played without being an asshole and i have 0 kills with exit gates open, I will try my best to get someone without resorting to bitch tactics like camping. If the other survivors actually let me leave the hook, cause people love hook diving

---
Last update was busted I was a rank 20 learning nurse and huntress going against reds I actually gave up out of pure frustration for a little bit 
---
Just got tunneled in a match. Like the killer abandoned chases whenever they saw me to come after me. And then after I was unhooked for the second time a survivor threw down a pallet immediately and I was trapped in the pallet. Killer comes back, breaks pallet, I go 2 feet, and I'm downed and hooked again. Feels bad man.
---
You get teamed up with fewer noobs though. 
---
Pip: The tick marks that show your progress towards the next rank. They are gained/lost through game play via the emblem system. Depending on your rank, you have a scoring requirement to reach in order to gain a pip and have a requirement to stay above otherwise you lose a pip. The emblems give 0pts = none, 1pts = bronze, 2pts = silver, 3pts = gold, 4pts = iridescent. The way you increase the quality of the emblems is based on your actions during gameplay.
---
Hex: Devour Hope: Devour hope is a totem that requires tokens in order to function. To stack tokens you must hook a survivor then move 24 meters away from the hook. If you are out of the range and the survivor is unhooked, you gain a token up to 5 maximum. 2 Tokens gives you a haste buff, 3 tokens gives you double damage (Exposed Effect), 5 tokens grants the ability to preform a Mori to kill the survivor with your own hand when in the dying state.
---
Obsession Perks: When a survivor or killer has an add on or perk that causes the obsession mechanic, a random survivor's portrait on the HUD will be surrounded by the entity spikes. This indicates the killer's obsession. All obsession based effects (for example Dying Light, Rancor, Play With Your Food) will apply to that survivor only. So if the killer is trying to stack PWYF they need to chase the obsession then let them escape since it gives them a stack of haste (up to 3). There can be an obsession even if the killer does not have an obsession perk at all and vice versa for survivors that do not run any of Laurie Strode's Perks (Because i'm pretty sure she is the only survivor that has them). Example: If a survivor is running Decisive Strike (Which also increases their chance to be the obsession if needed to be chosen by the game) and the killer is running non obsession perks, the survivor will still become the obsession since there is at least one obsession perk in play. This also applies to addons such as Freddy's Black Box and Myer's Judith's Journal.

I get such bad games when I run Tuft. People just dc when the T3 doesn't end, or afk in lockers, or I get it with one gen remaining or something like that.
---
So I should run legion every game to pip now....evil plan has been hatched MUHAHAHA
---
I'm actually pretty shit at Legion though if I'm honest. I find the fast motion distracts and confuses me so I get lost when I should be chasing them down. I usually main Pig, and I'm far better, but I find that post-patch Legion, I'm still pipping at a similar rate to when I was a Pig if I had a mediocre game. So not sure what that's about. 
---
This comment is also unnecessary
---
It depends on the situation.  If it's just a really dumb play then I'll still take the easy down because it was just the survivor being dumb.  However if they are unhooking RIGHT in front of me, going for the farm or sandbag then yeah I'll just go for the person farming because fuck em.

Bruuuuuuuuuute!

Mostly. Seeing as DS was nerfed that’s not really a complaint anymore. There’s also a couple exhaustion perks I don’t really like. I hate the ones that take no thought like sprint burst.
---
Iron Grasp, Agitation, Mad Grit, Enduring on any killer: "It's team-up time!"

I was mostly memeing. As I main Nurse I get what you mean about motion confusion, pesky survivors are so difficult to track. I recommend getting Bloodhound if you have issues with them breaking line of sight, it helped me a lot.
---
Tyler and spirit make the same fucking noises so
---
Because legion removes all skill from the game. You find someone, they go down on a timer. You get found, you go down on a timer. They can’t be looped so the only way to get away from a legion is for them to be stupid irl and lose track of you or run into a pallet stun with feral frenzy 
---
Barabrian 
---
I don’t believe she is stronger than huntress. She lacks a lot of consistency huntress has and is also limited by the range and honestly shitty hit boxes on plauges vomit. Also harder for her to snowball since corrupt plague is on a timer.
---
I think a win is getting enough emblems and entertaining the entity, that's always been the point of the trails. The devs haven't lost sight of the spirit of the game at all.
---
Yikes 
---
The entire reason I actually got into this game was for the lore
---
I was sorely disappointed that it basically has no bearing on the game whatsoever, alas
---
(flashlight) Saving teammates is pretty much the opposite to those things, slowing down the killers objective. Totems are important because you can remove the killers perks from the game permanently which gives a good advantage.

Having the noed totem light up while you are cleansing a dull
---
I still dont understand how shes staying directly behind you, unless you're not using scenery and pallets. Once you throw down a pallet she either has to break it or walk around it either way you put distance between the two of you. She also has to slow herself down to vomit.
---
I'm not sure she would really have much of a killer power if it didn't build during Chase. Survivors can see Fountain auras and cleansing takes a very small amount of time. If it didn't build in Chase she would have to vomit then manually hit the survivor twice. Once they got unhooked they would just cleanse as usual. I wouldn't make sense to ever use her power outside of temporarily becoming Huntress a couple times a game .
---
The easiest way to pip has always been to farm idk why you think that’s new

Similar thing with Jeff tbh. Literally a slightly shorter beard and an inch off his hair, and it costs like 4950 iridescent shards.

I probably should have used /s instead of kappa but thought it would be obvious enough
---
Thats not that long. Chances are it always took that long but you didnt notice because people would come in and out of the lobby. Now all that in out is done on the backend
---
Nice save kappa
---
Great tier list, I completely agree with everything except perhaps Spirit being the hardest killer in the game (maybe in current patch with 2 bugnerfs). imo huntress is more difficult to play because of a requirement to really learn every map hatch texture filtration and huge drawbacks.  
---
Also did you mean Unnerving presence in Doctor part? Overwhelming presence is funny to use sometimes, but I dont see how it'd affect tracking
---
Just received mine!  I can't express enough thanks for how Bloddy amazing this is in person!!! Outstanding work
---
Thanks, I appreciate that. I mostly based it off Tony Moran, and used this as a reference point https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/halloweenmovie/images/c/cf/Moran.png/revision/latest?cb=20150528024814
---
But we've had so many different wonderful people playing Myers that I did want to try and combine them a bit. Tyler Mane and Tony Moran have very similar noses to Jamie Lee Curtis, which was what I was trying to go for. 
---
*laughs in Lightborn*
---
First time I've ever witnessed a hook escape. Thought it was just a myth
---
You didn’t really answer his question directly though, you said it more like “well it’s obviously obvious so you shouldn’t have to ask this question,” which seems condescending to me 
---
I preferred death gardens gameplay so much compared to dbd.. too bad they didn't advertise it *at all* and way overpriced it for early access
---
Maybe the revamp will bring some new players in, maybe when the Game fully releases people will think it's worth the price. I can't even play dbd anymore because it feels so slow in comparison. 
---
I miss DG :(
---
Oh my bad I thought she was the shortest killer is it hag or Rin who’s the shortest?
---
Not sure why people only talk about David's abs. His ass is the star of the show in those red pants.
---
As Killer I can never seem to remember where it is. I remember, my first ever game on that map I fell through and actually got lost. 
---
Damn was really hoping you’d die
---
I've been actually pipping as survivor ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Isn't PS4 worse though (as in framerate and toxicity) I find most things that are buggy in the game with people stating that they are PS4 but idk I'm probably wrong
---
Whoops, yup.  That's a mistake on my end, I see Overwhelming as extremely meh 
---
And yet I hit it with them 3 inches away and it does nothing
---
That’s weird, but the billy I faced legit only had enduring on. Hmmmmm this is a mystery 
---
I think because it's the morning and that's it
---
What might have happened was the ping wasn’t stable (was green at lobby, uncontrollable in game) or a straight up lag switch. I’ve had hits like that from normal m1 attacks, it’s still BS 100%, but it’s out of your control as a survivor some of the time
---
Its only hard when close to red ranks tbh
---
Thanks for the support :) I had fun doodling her and the perks. Eventually I'm gonna write a backstory and in depth description of her power and make a survivor with perks too. I'm probably gonna redraw everything digitally and make it look professional
---
Out of chase? "Heretic, Hero/Zealous Champion" or "Peril/Jeopardy" from Halo 2. In chase? Probably "Engaged" from Halo Reach. Dunno why because it has so little to do with Trapper, it just sounds awesome if I edit it in. 
---
Huntress would like to know your location 
---
As shameful as it sounds it's unlikely he listens to Queen. 
---
I'm at R5 or 6 atm, i don't really keep track cause idc about rank.
---
Getting. it was last night and I'm probably a good 100 hours in to the game. Not much by a lot of peoples standards, but I only started playing like 2ish weeks ago
---
Or she’s just ugly as fuck like every other survivor 
---
These are technically Billy's advantages and they dont properly "work" against good survivors most of the time. So his real potential is very limited despite him being able to theoretically make awesome plays like downing all 4 survivors at the same time with chainsaw
---
Like something by Approaching Nirvana or Deadmau5. I like it. 
---
The rank is the reward in itself, when you do good you want the game to acknowledge it. Doing a flawless game only be told you didn’t do good enough sucks. 
---
Matchmaking isn’t as bad as people say, higher ranks tend to face higher, but if everyone who was red is now rank 10 they will start facing newer players and getting even easier games and still not pip. At least before, if you had an easy game it would rank you up until you got good games. 
---
There is one reward, the achievement for achievement hunters. 
---
My heart will go on by Celine Dion 😂the titanic song
---
I can't decide if Rin is terrifying or adorable and it's tearing up my insides.
---
Oh, cool. I started back in January. Which Killer did you get mori'd by? 
---
Seconded. Dwight with a lizard is husband material.
---
The Hag! I must say when she bit the throat I got nauseous for a moment but tbh I've never been good with gore
---
*rin getting hit by pallet noise*
---
And watch them get yanked out and hooked because locker stun doesn't work.
---
I'd say in this instance, her face says more of a "" ^waah ;-;"
---
Finding someone in a basement locker is so damn satisfying 
---
Just had a game like this as survivor. My framerate was ass and everyone was huge and stretched. This game is broken
---
Because he is an amazing bp generator, slap on distressing + beast of prey and you can get 15,000 blood points in a 5 minute gen rush.
---
Lmfao
---
There is zero balance. Most of my games are fucked. I am at rank 12 survivor and I got put with a rank 14, 8 and 5 against a rank 2 god tier nurse lol. That game didn’t last long lol  
---
Didnyou have 28 matches in the row where the totem was placed right next to a gen?
---
This can only end in death or make-outs.
---
What are you talking about, nothing strange happened a year ago. Nothing happened.
---
I can’t believe how many killers I have told in the last few days to get thee back to rank 1. Teasingly of course because they murdered my face, but also a little bit seriously.
---
As Killer, only consider it a win if I 4k excluding a hatch escape. If I 3k and the last survivor gets hatch I still consider it a win.
---
As Survivor, it's a win if I pip, simple as that.
---
r/terriblefacebookmemes
---
I understand that pov, but for me the logic is: Why provide a ranking system when it's useless/ don't motivate you playing the game? 
---
Dirty legion main... 
---
It does have a very odd hitbox 
---
I mostly buy cosmetics for myself lol. I realised how little I actually notice skins in the heat of the moment of the game, but it is also nice to show support to the devs as well when they come out with a patch you really like!
---
I love this community 
---
Aww, I'm glad you like it. Thanks so much for letting me know. &lt;3
---
furries deserve to know they're disgusting, u know
---
I don't think that's new lol
---
I’d be more frustrated for the survivors. That sucks, being down a person right from the start. When someone does that I usually farm with the remaining survivors 
---
OH My
---
Survivors are really bad at the higher ranks. If not SWF, getting a competent team outside of red ranks is extremely difficult. I do agree though, no rewards and easier killers at lower ranks so I don't mind staying lower.
---
RUIN TO TOTEMS!
---
It's weird that you would place the Doctor higher than you would place the wraith as they are in a somewhat similar place.  On their own without add ons both killers are extremely weak but with the right ones they can be devastating.
---
A purple all Seeing add on and a purple wind dance add on let you zoom around the map while still being able to see the immersed claudettes hiding behind a tree, rock, etc. 
---
Plus with windstorm you can generally either beat the survivor to a pallet/window and then body block it so they can't interact with it or place yourself halfway in the loop and lunge to them based on which way they drop the pallet.
---
TLDR: Bing Bong, his placement is wrong.
---
OP, remember when the last event had two bugs:
---
1) Killer DC and screws everyone out of points  
---
2) Survivor leaves first with lantern and everyone gets the points
---
They fixed 2 and left 1 alone. Don't assume BHVR cares about DC's depiping survivors.
---
RBT kills with the Pig
---
Maybe not that many, but I've had my totems be destroyed even when they were far away from a gen and I've had them remain for almost the entire game when it was next to a gen that had already been completed when they destroyed it. When all totem spots are good, none of them are. If none of them spawn near gens or landmarks, survivors will know and will look away from these locations. Keeping a diversity in totem spots, be it close to gens or not, keeps people on their feet when looking for them. Hex totems, ideally, stay hidden, but there should be at least some kind of counter. If it's such a big problem, you could use Thrill of the Hunt or Haunted Ground.
---
You caught me, a p3 50 Joey. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
*bows*  It's awesome how dedicated and involved you are on here and making this community so much better!! 
---
I usually do too but not if I have someone else watching.
---
Hmm... why is it you feel that way, exactly?
---
Also, you DO know it's possible to hold a conversation and state your opinion without sounding like a jackass, right? Just thought I should let you know that. A simple "I don't like furries" would suffice. I would still ask "Why is that?" of course, but at the very least I would be more inclined to respect your opinion than you just calling all of them disgusting.
---
Oh no :o
---
But what if David spears Legion out of nowhere. He can take the knife and beat the shit out of them.
---
Bowel Movement, I bet that killer feels like shit.
---
LOL bitch I’ve has this game since 2016!!! I have no problem playing myself. My whole point is that the game gets boring due to lack of objectives. You’re crazy ahaha byeee
---
Woman or not, they are a threat to him so violence is accepted.
---
That’s what I’m saying, there’s a reason we have a lobby screen where you can see the players before the match starts. The day BHVR forces me to play with people living on the moon without my input is the day I drop the game.
---
I'm on board with sprint burst, but it's nothing compared to what it used to be. Exhaustion perks as a whole took a huge blow with the exhaustion nerf. Half the time my deadhard doesn't even register.
---
Thank you so much. RIP man.
---
\* Sorry, your computer does not meet the minimum specifications required to run this product \*
---
But the only think that doesn't have the green sign is the dedicated video RAM in the recommended section, everything else is ok. Given I meet all minimum requirements and 7/8 of the recommended requirements shouldn't I be able to somewhat run it? Sorry if I sound like an ignorant.
---
Idk maybe this was an isolated situation.
---
I’ve played against her one time and won with no issues. But this player was just walking back and forth between generators vomiting which just irritated me
---
I believe Easter should be a double BP event 
---
Bruh it’s not a glitch there’s a small button to the left of your guide button and if you press it you invert your controls 
---
"There is a time and place for everything, but not now"
---
This can't be working, it says I can't run Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 but I've been playing for over a year just fine. Sorry for the double reply.
---
Wow. You got some balls XD
---
New player here
---
So does hitting level 50 do anything special to the blood web? 
---
If you like the show, you'll like Army of Darkness. The original Evil Dead and the sequel, maybe not.
---
Im sorry to say this but did you even bothered playing trapper before saying that?
---
Which reddit are you on lol all I ever see are people complaining about the queue times and the weird ranks people are being matched with, survivor and killer alike
---
BUG FIXES AND CHANGES:
---
Fixed an issue that made it impossible to pick up Survivors if they were downed while cleansing themselves at a fountain.

---
Misc localization and translation improvements.  
---
Misc LOD improvements. 
---
I'm main survivor and have waiting queues from 5 to 75 minutes 
---
And as a killer I have between 1 and 7 minutes 
---
I think I have the same if not similar laptop as you, game goes kinda potato for me (lowest graphics and fps drops and so) but is playable for me. Can't wait to be able to upgrade to a new and better one because as I said, playable but very potatoy.
---
Who is the dude Fourth in from the left?
---
What's the point in caring about rank? Play a solo game at rank 15...then play a solo game at rank 1. Why do you think a lot of people complain about reset?
---
I think that’s his problem he’s a bit easier to play than billy but he’s inferior in every way 
---
Can't wait for dedicated servers to reveal that most survivors complaining about lag switches are actually salty bitches with bad internet 
---
😫😫😫me looking at a meg leg. 😷😷😘😘🤟🤟
---
Huntress is a DLC killer...
---
then it mustn't be a consistent bug, but it was definitely happening to us against the plague. 
---
Not to mention they broke spirit for the 3rd patch in a row, randomly nerfed spies from the shadows, and the infinite loading screen bug that has been around since the legion is still here. 
---
people are downvoting it and i don't understand why
---
Did they fix the crash on launch issue?
---
Tried both iron will and calm spirit during ptb
---
Iron will makes coughing a but quieter but does nothing with puke
---
Calm spirit does nothing at all
---
I miss it too. Haven't seen in in the main menu ever since I bought the *seifuku*. I couldn't pass on the chance of looking like the adorable high school student she used to be.
---
phew, now i can continue WAAAAaaaAaAAAing at pallets without fear
---
that cosmetic is cute af and has a septum piercing. understandable. 
---
Well rip. I'll buy it and test it and I'll return it if its unbearable.
---
Good to hear, as a person obsessed over making perks and additions to this game i really like seeing people share their stuff they put effort into.
---
It's similar for Jane, she has a few cosmetics that literally only change the color of her lipstick.
---
Type of Bug: Gameplay
---
Map: Autohaven Wreckers, Wretched Shop
---
Bug description: I was playing against The Plague and a fountain in the middle of the map was not able to be interacted with, resulting in 4 survivors with broken status.
---
Video showing the bug: https://plays.tv/video/5c93fec89bf10981b2/nice-man-kan-tage-den-?from=user
---
\&gt;! I think the mods just put this out as a general reminder, not specifically referring to the recent leak !&lt;
---
Ok i  get that it will take time to seperate good survs from the bad ones in higher ranks after the ranking change, but this should not affect the above mentioned depip- problem. 
---
Anyway, I hope they'll fix it and till then I have to stay calm and wait... a long time probably as far as I know BHVR's hotfix/bug department. 
---
I think I’ve seen this position in a video somewhere idk might just be me
---
&gt;But you gotta admit it's a match made in hell for Survivors with Blood Warden.
---
Combo that with Piggy saving RBT's for when the gates are open.
---
He’s 6’5
---
I think everyone is all for it being harder to pip, the issue is that if you steamroll the other team, instead of double popping because clearly you should be higher, you either de pip or black pip depending on how high up you already are in rank. That needs to be fixed.
---
Am I perv for knowing the reference?
---
Bc its reddit lol Ive had random stuff downvoted for no reason. Could also be a problem not effecting to many people and the nonbelievers are downvoting idk
---
I don't know why people complain about it. I mainly play survivor solo in the first place unless I see a friend online but I play killer more so idk.
---
I'm guessing not on console because need update bit more aka removing the leaked perks.
---
That's another topic and imo also an unmotivating cause unrewardable system. I'm totally with you and would like to see changes in that topic but my problem is not the ranking system itself (i should update the header..) but the ranking progress, that is broken by some dumb survs.
---
Well yeah BHVR has to get their priorities right!!! /s
---
Yeah this is PC.  
---
Sure it does. However, Stridor is better for chasing down a target no matter what (it's near impossible to lose someone once you start chasing them due to the increased volume). It also helps with finding survivors who are attempting to hide. That entire build is supposed to be about being the most toxic tunneling POS you can be and Stridor allows you to do it that much more effectively. Why waste time forcing survivors to heal in discrete corners of the map when you can just find them and kill them yourself?
---
Healing others, and unhooks is the last one.
---
I guess there's that survival category, but I feel like you just need to not be downed / hooked multiple times for that to be okay.
---
She's weaker than Huntress imo. Huntress has consistency with her hatchets and can snowball very fast at any point in the game if Survivors mess up. Plauge's regular vomit gets you only one hit so if the survivor reaches a loop before you can down them then you will have to chase them around that like billy or myers. Her corrupt purge also suffers from being on a timer, significantly shorter range then huntress, and some very wonky hitboxes. She definitely isn't weak at all but she has a few points that keep her from being overbearing. 
---
it's because with graphic cards, there's no set line of what can run it and what can't. That's why it probably says you can't run it. Sometimes it says that your graphics card shouldn't be able to run it, but it can for some reason. Everything else on that website works fine, just the graphics card portion of it is a little iffy
---
yea I think you should be able to, but don't take my word for it. I would do what someone else said, buy it and if it doesn't work then just return it 
---
Why my pp happy?
---
Ah Nurse. As a console player, when i went for all her trophies, I swear I've never been so frustrated in my life. On the match that I finally got 'Adept Nurse' I swear I was sweating. Too stressful for me to continue with.
---
Bloodhound - I'm guessing it still doesn't let Legion see trails during Frenzy, but lets you more easily/readily see the trails after you come out of it? Usually during Frenzy I stab someone, look around to try to find another one and fail to find one so try to lock back on to original guy, and end up running into a wall.
---
I stay on the off chance the killer feels bad and wants to farm lol.
---
It happens more frequently on the new map. I told a dev about this because obviously it's broken. I got downvoted for letting a dev know about an exploitable bug in the game. This community is completely fucking ridiculous.
---
Is the Spirit going to continue have the shattered glass sound?
---
Legit, I've been playing both sides a fair bit and have decent internet. My connection is perfectly fine in most matches. And then there's that one fucking Infinite Tier 3 Myers that can't seem to win without a lag switch. Good lobby ping, good ping when nobody's in a chase, but as soon as they find someone, lag city.
---
Killers objective is to sacrifice all 4 survivors. Not hook one and stare at them.
---
&gt;Literally going through survivors
---
&gt;Fixed
---
I member this
---
When you throw the pebble you've had in your pocket the entire game and get the killer to check behind a random tree while your teammate finishes opening the gate.
---
Yes, you still need 9 hooks to get iridescent. My point is even if you disconnect, the killer gets a 20% bonus per DC toward devout scoring. This means disconnecting does nothing for the survivor and doesn't hurt the killer at all.
---
Gotcha. I'll do what most redditors are suggesting, I'll buy it and see if it works, if not I'll return it.
---
it looks like that giant soldier glitch from Battlefield 3
---
I like the Ruin change because it means more people will have to learn how to work through Ruin instead of gen tapping. (It also means I don't have to grind the Bloodweb as much for a useful perk.) But in the moment it's painful to have allies who have never seen Ruin before in their life suddenly face this "overpowered, uncounterable perk."
---
Your style is so good!!!
---
As others said you can't do that or they'll all be cleansed automatically but what you can do is take your time using them to whittle down and herd where survivors go if they want to cleanse.
---
It used to when it pitched you against people who were around the same rank. Only problem is that's out the window now too...
---
I'm not complaining lol. And I agree, it does work the same with survivors too. I'm a survivor main. I don't play killer.
---
I mean... in its current state it’s completely useless... the only reason people used it was to avoid campers, and it cannot be used for it. 
---
It ain't much, but it's honest work
---
I mean, with Kate, Jane, and Spirit, you've certainly got some ass to see.
---
if you sit there and teabag and be a toxic cunt, you sir, are in fact deserve the face camp. so many fucking salty toxic surv mains
---
I've rarely seen people DC against other killers in the purple and red ranks. I see your point though. For people who want to play the new killer, it sucks when you can't get into a match, especially with the long queue times. All I can say is that I don't DC the second I see Legion, but if I'm hit with a franks and the Legion immediately starts doing the moon-walking exploit, I'll peace out ASAP. I will say that I have had good matches against Legions that played him in the way he was designed to be played.  
---
Whenever Legion comes up I feel the need to voice my opinion. I'm just trying to add my voice the conversation about Legion, and help push the devs to make this a higher priority issue. Clearly it's not just bad for survivors. The problems with Legion's mechanics are making it difficult for killers to get into games where people don't DC. I just want BHVR to step in on this and fix the issue. It took them literal eons to fix DS, but they've shown that they can come up with good solutions. Hopefully the do something before I die of old age.
---
Killer: I get lotsa bp and at least two, preferably three, kills.
---
Survivor: i get lotsa bp and escape 
---
So we can actually get to level 50 after we prestige
---
&gt; Yeah, that works. At the cost of abandoning a survivor because their perk is too strong
---
I said *if* it's a problem. I often just eat it cause I run enduring for pallet loops anyway.
---
&gt;I use a huntress slugging build, I know it's very strong. It's still very difficult to pull off against four people, three is more possible but still difficult.
---
Slugging works as long as you know the location of another survivor very quickly, or there are 1 or more injured survivors in the match. Slugging brings survivors to your side of the map. They're like mini-hooks, only more bait-y because survivors don't mind picking someone up who might be hidden over an unhook.
---
DC'ing also helps survivors a ton in most regards, as unintuitive as that sounds. Same reason why tunnelling flat out never works in a killer's favour; survivors spend less time running to and from gens.
---
Killer chases someone for a minute and they DC? Well, no reason to stop this gen at 70%. Killer now has to wander around and guarantee hearing 2 gens pop midway through next chase, perhaps bringing the game down to 3-2 gens by the time they are chasing their second survivor with no one else injured. By the time they get second person on hook and someone is forced to do altruism, you probably have 2 50%+ gens.
---
This may be anecdotal, but when it comes to games that people DC in I tend to play a little more hardcore as well. Gen rush/ commit to using pallets more liberally.
---
I swear to you, I survive more often solo queueing into a "single DC" match than I have in regular 4 survivor rounds. Altruism gets people off gens, which is also why slugging works to begin with.
---
Meme.
---
🦀 I'm playing against Rank 3s 🦀
---
🦀 At Rank 10 🦀
---
As I said if the DC happens before the survivor has been hooked first time the iri may be impossible even with 9 hooks (but someone may have to test this to verify). So I wouldn’t exactly say „doesn’t hurt the killer at all“. It depends on when the DC happens, if it is when the survivor is on death hook then it certainly hurts the least. 
---
Hello Phillip
---
If you think that's bad then you should see their general post history. Yikes.
---
Are they legal?
---
[Jane has three yellow alternate head cosmetics that change the color of her lipstick and give her a bit of make up. They literally don't do anything else.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b3lhw0/jane_has_3_cosmetics_that_change_the_color_of_her/)
---
WHY ARE YOU BOOING ME I'M RIGHT
---
I don't think I had been in radius of the perk to work, but if it works the same way as the doctors scream, yes it will work 
---
He rage quit because he was chasing one person while myself and two survivors popped two gens. Besides, if he had left right before the 1st gen completed, I would still depip and my argument would hold.
---
I bought it. I really don't like his default old man look but the young boii beard is cute af uwu.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b3lhw0/jane_has_3_cosmetics_that_change_the_color_of_her/
---
Good, only nurse in rank 1, just as God intended it.
---
Nothing screams white trashy more than that T-shirt/hat/hair combo.  Get your grubby peddling ass out of here. 
---
I’m guessing they’re going to keep it as a shadow nerf.
---
UHHHHHHHHHHHHH [EXCUSE ME](/intensifies) HE HAS A NAME YOU KNOW THAT IS THE SURVIVOR FROM THE DEAD BY DAYLIGHT VIDEO GAME NAMED JACOB PARKINSONS GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT FML 😤
---
thank you!!! 
---
I've bought some but I have to admit they're all very overpriced.
---
Damn beat me to it.
---
So I'm not alone having this issue. I still couldn't even try out the new chapter. :/ Unlucky
---
The shirt itself has terrible placements of the characters. The only cool part is the font for Myers but besides that it’s lame af 
---
So out of all problems you want to “fix” teabagging
---
RIP mind games.  This is what made her amazing. 
---
Probably because you're a lower rank with killer then
---
Yeah I have no fucking idea why that hole is there and why it's so hidden. I had a game as Myers the other day and I'm walking along the wall trying to keep close to it in case I see a Survivor around the corner and then "welp guess I'm here now."
---
Ironically enough there was actually a survivor Self Caring in the basement so it ended up working out for me.
---
Along with Tampered Timer and Chloroform to keep them from trying to Dead Hard over the line
---
Not to mention the three characters make up Halloween, not “Myers”.  This shirt belongs in the long lines at a water slide park. 
---
^waaah
---
I'm killer rank 1 and survivor rank 1 
---
It's new, they introduced it with the matchmaking changes and the subsequent patch the other day.
---
Dedicated servers are supposed to come this summer.
---
Aww, that's really sweet of you. &lt;3 I appreciate you saying that.
---
What about the leaked perks?
---
A c h i e v e m e n t s
---
Oh yeah she can be a real game slower
---
Long time killer and I'm honestly over 4k's. At this point I want fun chases.
---
If the gates open it's literally gg dude. I even feel bad when I get someone on their 3rd hook when they are open.
---
The only people I go thirsty over are people who scumbag their own teammates (waste god pallets/ sandbag players who are good at chases)
---
she never was, wraith is taller. unless you mean tallest female.
---
No, McLean said on his stream last night that they never do shadow nerfs and that they're already working on fixing the Spirit bugs.
---
Rank doesn't matter because of rewards, it matters because it's supposed to be indicative of your skill set. I literally do not care what number I am in rank but I want my matches to be balanced. I don't want to be completely wrecked in minutes or have a cake walk. I want a fair match. When you're level 12-15 and get a rank 2 killer and it's not SWF, you know there's a problem. 
---
McLean said they're working on that issue 
---
Yeah, it's not fun for neither of the parties. This must be fixed
---
It was, but now it's just an anti tunneling perk
---
Then how much did u pay for her?
---
Exactly.
---
Both sides are equally as annoying. 
---
The have only seen the Cannibal's chainsaw get blocked twice on trees, once on a wall, and once on a window but I still got downed. The thing seems really inconsistent as I've seen it clip through plenty of objects without pause.
---
I also play both survivor and killer, usually it's the opposite side that starts the toxicity, if someone doesn't agree with your opinion, they are not a "survivor main"
---
Keep playing; it makes the games where I've pulled it off against serious Killers have been very exciting.
---
Wraith looks shorter here maybe without her hat huntress is smaller never knew 
---
Survivor : Jake. Played him since release, I just like his jacket.
---
Killer : Trapper. I've swapped killers a lot, but trapper is just great. He's big and scary, and you can anti-loop the entire map.
---
Those perks actually say otherwise. 
---
yeah its by eye height
---
Ah, I don't have Legion so I didn't know he doesn't see tracks at all. Even so, it makes them last longer for what it's worth and also make them far easier to notice
---
I spawned is as the obsession despite the killer using no obsession perks or add ons and myself also not running any obsession perks? My friend had DS and yet I was the obsession to boot. 
---
Exactly I love the mindgame potential of this game, yet since pallet looping gives so many more bloodpoints than just hiding from the killer, not to mention far more effective, it’s all people do. Apart from Claudette mains of course.
---
DLC is downloadable content. Not all DLCs are paid for. There are free DLCs such as Nurse and Huntress DLCs for this game.
---
Freddy because i hate myself and Min because she is quiet and can sneak around and shes a gamer.
---
guess u never played dbd in the first 1-1.5 years...
---
Wait so you aren’t supposed to lose all your power as spirit when hit by a pallet? How long has it been like that, I thought that was a feature lol
---
I had a game with this too. I brought the killer over to it and they let me try to finish gens and get hatch.
---
Guess you have no idea what you're talking about. The cap was instated to detect &amp; prevent HACKING, not botting.
---
Praise!

---
I mean it was more of the killer’s fault than a good play from the survivor, but either way satisfying to watch
---
#Happy Cake Day
---
imagine being Jane yet still using meta perks
---
Yep. He has lightborn. 
---
I actually haven’t seen it but also most of the time it’s only me or me and one other person left due to DCs so the killer lets us farm.
---
Well then i ment paid killers
---
Standing behind Jane.
---
Hi! 
---
Queue times dont tske more than 5 minutes at red ranks. I got 4 rank 15 survivors as a rank 1 Killer. 
---
I’d say op played pretty fair just from this end game screen. Getting almost max 32k means that he probably triple or at least double hooked everyone, and the top two survivors got decent points so they probably both hit a few chases, unhooks, gens throughout the game. Especially considering the rank of all the survivors, a killer could easily demolish them all and they get few points at all. The perks are just the most efficient for most killers but it’s not like they’re annoying ones like Noed or insidious.
---
This was painful to watch
---
TBR reports from the game just go in the fire. 
---
More thicc please
---
I would keep playing. Sometimes Killers can be real cuddly. If you die? Oh well. But if the killer decides to farm it's a win win.
---
it means that she has collected a pool of devotion and now can damage you with her vomit for a little while
---
Being a survivor when the last gen is popped, and you're casually close to a totem and it suddenly lights up and the killer is miles away
---
such a small addition but i love it
---
I see you use unternet explorer.
---
Man, it's been three days since her official release.  
---
Maybe you need to change up your perks or your strategy when you're facing off with her.
---
You don't run from a huntress the same way you'd run away from a hill billy.
---
we're gonna hex forever
---
I’ve already watched the first 8 episodes! :D
---
Depends. If it’s Legion, a bullshit add-on, or a mori I’d just leave. Otherwise I’ll stick around.
---
Eh? I'm playing on PS4? 
---
I’m aware of that. I think it was just a different situation where the person playing her was just being annoying 
---
*a pretty good job so far* echoes in the background 
---
Me and my party usually get that. We usually have to come full circle of different people making lobbies in order to get a game 
---
This is not accurate, claudatte would have DC'd in the first panel
---
00:41 your sprint burst activated, again.
---
It's one time use as it stands now because what would stop you from getting downed and using it again if you're within the timer.
---
Thanks for being the 964th person to post this
---
Bro, I'm trying to main nurse, you're telling me I'm supposed to be able to find P3 claudettes hiding around rocks and bushes with Urban with a speed of 3,8m/s and not waste time? Running ruin is a necessary risk, without ruin the game would end in 5 mins bcs even the shittiest toolbox increases repair speed by a ton. Btw Rank 1 is literally almost undoable without ruin or some cheesy/crutch method
---
*Platform:* PC 
---
*Type of Bug:* Visual, Audio,
---
*Description:* One of the bugs are that,
---
°Some Male Characters dont have facial animations when opening a exit door for example (eyes moving,Mouth Etc,),Quentin Smith and Detective Tapp Have That Strange Bug/Glitch
---
°Some Survivors Have their eyes closed during some Moris Animation (Mouth Inc, like in the Plague Mori)
---
°The Plague has No Voicelines in the Menu (Idle Animation) instead a gunshot or weird sound is heard,And when a survivor gets healed in the fountain,the sound notification plays like 5x times
---
I've literally seen, like, 2. I didn't know people were already aware. 
---
How was she being annoying?
---
If you're on PS4, I know two of the gongs are cleansing survivors and the plague's power up, but there's a multitude of others  I haven't figured out yet
---
I forgot to memtion that it would still stop the timer, you'd just be able to use it again if you get hooked a second time. Maybe the 2nd change is a little too strong, but I really want the first one
---
Accurate
---
Survivor was unplayable before the queues were so bad.  I'm getting lobbies in under a minute now.  Sure some break but it is still infinitely better than waiting 20 plus minutes to maybe get a lobby that the killer doesn't then dodge
---
It’s a bug that slipped in the 2.6.0 patch
---
That's the sound of your teamates screwing up by feeding her corrupt purges.  Just stay sick and repair brothers.  EZ games.
---
Not to be rude but posts like this have been made like a thousand times 2 days ago I believe. So I’d just delete the post.
---
Ah. Haven’t played spirit more than two weeks, glad they’re removing that 
---
Honestly, NOED and most hex perks are balanced around the fact that people don't know how many totems are left, so here's an idea:
---
When the last dull totem is cleansed, make a unique noise notification similar to that of a Hex Totem cleanse, but slightly different, with an icon like blue lightning. That way there's no more "did my teammates cleanse the rest of the totems" while not making it overtly obvious with a counter
---
Do you know that nurse can... you know... blink?.. Nurse main is the last person who should complain about games going too fast since nurse could literally win the game in 2 minutes. Also you should try PGTW on nurse, better then ruin imo. 
---
This glitch is very common for me on PS4 lately. I got hooked in a recent match, but while I was on the hook my camera followed the killer everywhere. I'm taking advantage of this glitch for fun with friends lol
---
Surviror is Meg because I can do Track&amp;Field.
---
Killer is Nurse because she is awesome. 
---
Hey, I get that, but not if, and I'm not kidding, 90% of your lobbies break. It's that bad right now we have to restart 9 lobbies to get 2 lobby working, that's more annoying than just waiting 10-20 minutes, in my opinion at least.
---
Nah man almost if not all the big circumstantial game changing perks onl proc once per game and because of their benefits they have an inhenerent risk of being useless in your trial.
---
Think Unbreakable, Deliverance, Adrenaline, all of those are one use because of the way they can swing a match into the survivor's favor if the right requirements are met.
---
I agree. Been waiting for a Mori with somebodies head being blown off.
---
WHAT EVEN IS THAT
---
Can't relate, No Mither does not know what exposed means
---
Damn, trying to call out a 41 day old comment. I Ain’t your mate. And considering you can buy killers for 9000 shards, I’d say they are not a cash grab. 
---
BHVR is a lost cause. They gone crazy.
---
Iron Grasp.
---
2,000 IQ holy crap...
---
People will derank with any system, this one at least helps keep the games at high ranks better instead of people either being terrible or using a mori every game because they’ll depip if they do
---
Killer: Doctor. Disconnects are funny to watch. His ability lights up survivor locations for me. (I am not good against stealth.) His laugh is fun to hear. He allows me to play the game instead of camp and tunnel. And he stuns survivors. Just all around good character.
---
(I want to dab in plague and clown to just trying to get good builds and such.)
---
Survivor: claudette. (Or ninjuette in my eyes.) She's hard to spot if you know any good spots. It allows me to do gens cleanse totems, unhook and find a safe spot to hide. 
---
(Played Kate for a while because boil over and she was  cute. But I was always caught and such cuz I wasnt able to blend in as well as a claudette.)
---
I was looking at Kate cosmetics yesterday, and there are two ponytail hairstyles that are the same, and her hair colour changes ever so slightly. One is 250 AC, and the other is 200, i think.
---
Nea - Dat cosmetic ensemble though
---
Trappy Boi - Because all of your loops am belong to me.  Use that Pallet I doible dog dare ya.  
---
🦀JMODS WONT REPLY TO THIS POST🦀
---
He is inferior to Billy in every way but comparing two killers is kind of pointless. Its like comparing huntress to plague or hag to trapper. They are similar but they are both played completely differently.
---
Let's just say there are a few people that play legion to be silly with survivors. 
---
I purchased DBD on PS4 for my friends yesterday for 50% off I'm sure it works on PS4.
---
The only reason why it matters to me is that I hate playing killer as rank 15 and getting matched with 8’s and 6’s. I also hate being a rank 15 suvi and getting matched with a lvl 19 killer, well I mean I would enjoy it but I’m not a gg ez asshole
---
r/woooosh
---
Yamaoka?  What are you Halpert?
---
&gt;Unbreakable
---
It doesn't have a time limit
---
&gt;Deliverance
---
You can only try escaping the hook in thw first stage, you'd have to remove the struggle stage to use it twice
---
&gt;Adrenaline
---
Can't finish the final generator twice. Not to mention that this effect is way stronger than just stunning the killer for 3 seconds
---
Unbreakable: quite useless to be honest
---
Deliverance: balanced spot
---
Adrenaline: meta
---
Decisive Strike: quite useless to be honest
---
The problem is that Decisibe Strike doesn't have a useful effect at the moment. The killer will catch your right after
---
Haha wow nice catch
---
Just today, I was transporting a survivor to a hook as the killer. I didn’t know the hole was there and I fell through, with the survivor on my shoulder. The basement was down there. A welcome surprise, I’ll take it.

The hair is 400 auric cells taller
---
Wow is this new? I haven’t seen this at all sense the new dlc dropped 
---
There was a rank update?
---
If you castrate yourself, you cant get boners anymore *taps head*
---
It *shouldn't* matter, but as a result everyone is playing like an absolute asshole, so in effect it does matter. Matches the last few days have been fucking nightmares. Unfun, like pulling teeth to get through. Bad teammates, toxic play, just all around amplifying the worst parts of the game. I might need to take a break for a week. Either they'll reverse the rank change or everyone will have gotten used to it and stop playing like fucking baboons.
---
With this sub I never know if it’s satire or passive aggression, but still on me I guess
---
Jokes on them I only play legion anyway 
---
It's really useful for ambushing the gen in there, if you hear it above dropping down the hole is way faster than stairs and survivors don't see it coming.
---
Happened to me too. Stopped after I changed to another player view. 
---
it just happened to me, I haven't tested the perk out yet but if this is not a sign of change i dont know what is
---
My fave perk is noed
---
6'5 btw ecks dee
---
When playing as plague the game crashes as soon as the third person loop starts or as soon as you go into first person.  I have never had a killer game crash at the beginning like this. I’ve never really had a killer crash at all before.
---
The one other killer I’ve tried this patch was playable but I was experiencing extreme lag where I have never had lag. 
---
Survivor was laggy at the start of the patch but I’ve had no problems after a few days. 
---
Please help with this killer side issue or I have no choice but to main survivor instead of playing both sides.
---
Yeah matchmaking is all fucked up because basically no one is in red ranks right now lol. Imo if they wanna keep this ranking system they should space out the rank resets a bit more
---
I'm actually kind of okay with that. At least they're not locked behind any sort of loot box, and most of the pieces you can buy with shards are actually really nice.

I want cosmetic rewards. I want to flex on rank 20 survivors!
---
I love how someone is on the floor while you're doing that xD
---
I just said that I use off meta perks. Decisive Strike is no longer a crutch perk, do that is why I started using it
---
Can I get a link to the page, OP? 
---
Stop fucking pallet looping how about that? It's a strat some people use, They WILL de pip so you can't say "I was just playing the game normally!" You were being toxic.
---
Didnt know they could spawn there. I'll uh keep that in mind
---
Flying Ace and the Dwight Stuff. 
---
You‘re too late..DS is gone. 
---
You need to try it with another op survivor perk like Pharmacy, Diversion ah and not to forget Tenacity :-)
---
[Except if they run enduring](https://clips.twitch.tv/BrainyWildNarwhalPeteZaroll)
---
Good. Thanks for telling me, I’ve been dreading that being a nerf.
---
8/10 not as thick as Jane in game
---
Rank means less now than it did before. Before it at least meant you were mechanically skilled enough to be a challange at worst. Now it just means as a killer you can get a 4k and as a survivor you were rank 1 before reset and now you just blackpip
---
Actually it was a 4.8 seconds before.
---
Ive not tested the new one yet
---
Well, I assumed that you were a higher rank survivor since you had to specify, that you were a survivor main.
---
This is why Myers needs a head tilt emote.
---
Dwight because i like his cosmetics
---
wraith only if ive got the ghost+cax clapper, otherwise i dont play much killer
---
Had to delete the old album because Imgur is stupid... will update this post shortly with album link

This happens intermittently on PS4 too.

Couldn't have drawn her better haha
---
Damn bro you are the human version of r/whooosh
---
Well yeah that’s what killer mains having crying for what did you expect? 
---
Edit: Nice twitch! 
---
I love pallet mind games especially. Survivors can be really damn stupid and not pay attention to which loops are safe, so an on-point lunge that puts them into the Dying State after the vault is unbelievably satisfying. 
---

And this fellas, is why the game is unbalanced

Survivor would be Meg, her perks are nice and her rainbow jacket fucks
---
Killer would be Trap Daddy or Hatchet Mommy, they both have really fun playstyles. 
---
WHATS WRONG JIMMU-KUUUUN?
---
Brother Bill: "Whoa...!"
---
*Rank 15 :(
---
Dude, I have no problem finding survivors by standard, if I use Billy I can 4k almost every game rank 1. But with Nurse it's a different story, 1/2 of your entire game consists of having a blurry screen in which you can't see shit, if the survivor as much as runs iron will you're going to have to spend a shit ton of time finding them back after hitting them
---
Yeah they went overboard shortening the stun duration to what Decisive 1 was pre change.  The changes to what triggers it should have been enough.  They shouldn't have messed with the stun duration too.  I like that on paper the perk was redesigned to punish babytunnels but 3 seconds simply isn't enough time to be useful and Enduring literally makes the perk worthless which is a meta perk on many killers.
---
Beautiful.
---
Kate and Spirit since they are the prettiest 
---
And?..
---
could it be... YOU'RE CRAVING MY CROISSANT
---
Can you please for the love of god not drop pallets like that for no reason? 
---
What do you dislike about it. If you leave the hook is pretty much garunteed they'll escape.
---
It means stealth build is the end of it
---
Either exaggeration or region differences. Benefit of the doubt instead of assuming a lie.
---
These should be a thing on Killers, too. I'd like to see Billy just go "Wheeeeeeee hahaha."
---
Doesn't Loomis refer to him as pure evil that only takes the shape of a man?
---
There's a post about it literally 2 posts below yours in new
---
If you teleport towards a gen it already means fatigue, that gives them all the time in the world to get the f out of there and hide in a distant corner
---
This happens on PS4 as well. I spent a good 30 seconds trying to figure out just the right angle for it before finally giving up.
---
Joey, he's the forth member of Legion.
---
Ranking up was made more difficult. Not sure why since ranks offer no prizes or rewards other than a number. Not sure about the player level. Never paid enough attention to it but it feels like same to me. 
---
Ironic Nea sounds scared when she falls, pretty contrary to Balnced Landings quote

Like a bard, but a singer
---
Ayyye, I'm 5'6".
---
Most hacked profiles already give you like 100 of each add-on/offering and every perk so adding bloodpoints is pretty useless.
---
Good tips. I've noticed when i play plague, i have a much higher chance of losing the less times that i get corrupt. controlling which fountains she can access is very important
---
It varies, sometimes you'll get killers/survivors that are way better than you and sometimes way worse. This can happen at any rank but it especially happens after rank resets. Also some players de-rank to bully lower level players. I once got a rank 4 killer who missed attacks 4 times in a row, it happens. But don't worry it won't happen every single time and will be less of a problem when you get better at the game. 
---
Ah, thanks, friend. 
---
I want to live your fantasy land where survivors aren't toxic douchebags at every single opportunity.
---
Nice job. Very clean, nice to look at

No iteration of feral frenzy will ever be fun to play against. The whole reason legion is cancer is they can just vault through loops 
---
look if the Heartless in Kingdom hearts give free haircuts, the Entity has no excuse.
---
Not really. The killer was just absolute dog shit.
---
Could've double backed, could've blood lusted him, could've poisoned the entire path he ran on so that he would go away from the pallet, or could've simply just left.
---
You aren't supposed to 4-man and win every game. The game is balanced as is, killers like this guy in the video are the ones to complain when in reality they play like they're mentally handicapped, no offense.
---
Based on a true story
---
Anyone else hear Michael and Pigs breathing?

Kate needs to get her hairpiece checked, it's not really pinned down in the back.

Why is Adiris so damn tall? It doesn't make any sense. She's like eight foot 6.

we

go!
---
I get that there's no rewards, but people really forget the fact that the ranked system is there for a reason.
---
A rank 2 nurse against greys/greens? Well, those players are going to get stomped so hard they won't be able to learn jack shit from it because the match is going to last all of 5 minutes.
---
A rank 15 killer against rank 5 survivors? The killer is going to get looped till the cows come home and feel like the game is unfun and,  most likely, learn nothing from it.
---
I can attest. This happened to me, too.
---
It literally makes you not just kill everyone tho. Hooks/chases &gt; kills which is how it should be, they just need to lower the safety and one pip amounts a bit 
---
It states "merciless victory". So you actually need to double pip. Kills mattering is the relic of a long forgotten past.

I mean you are totally right. But it’s a dick measuring contest but with like 4+ inch dicks.

It happens with almost all the newer survivors.  Uncommon is just repaints of their default clothing, ever since Kate.

Yeah i think they’re preparing for dedicated servers

It doesn’t matter which survivor you play, they are just reskins lol

Best thing about baby’s against Myers. They think he’s just super cool and friendly.
---
This made me realize maybe it's not the best idea to jump two stories over a railing down a chute.

God, it takes *so* long just to buy a Killer/Survivor with irridecant shards, and it's more than twice that amount to get an outfit for one. I don't understand.

I need to get my hands on Deliverance so I can get the achievement for doing this. 
---
Am I seeing a Legion there
---
Oooooh so this is CGI edited
---
I can hear the thundering sound of them cheeks clapping
---
That’s not what I was talking about. If you only had the info of a survivor saying noed should be nerfed and a killer rebutting with that it’s fine it’s place you couldn’t tell the difference because instead of attacking the argument survivors AND killers attack each other.
---
I would be glad to see both BT and DS leave the game, in favour of base mechanics the sort of which you lined out entering it. And I think especially important is the part about grabbing that you mentioned: to allow for more interactive gameplay around hooks, the grabbing mechanic has to be adjusted, and protecting against being grabbed, in those situations, is an important part of countering hard-camping. Currently you can't even unhook a survivor while a third survivor is being grabbed off the unhook, due to the hooked survivor being locked in the animation.
---
Only for Discordance 😂👌🏻
---
As a fellow Trapper main I'm all too likely to see this 
---
Actually it affects new players' enjoyment.

Nah, there’s a few of us. Also, fun fact, Trixie plays DBD. 
---
Ah okay 👌🏻 
---
I find that the lower rank I am, the more the killer face camps which seems strange to me. 
---
I'm getting Left 4 Dead Flashbacks 
---
I dont think they’ll nerf ruin, they just buffed it
---
Wow, that is unexpected. Trixie Mattel?
---
That sounds really bad...
---
Carefully, he's a hero
---
Small Nurse, big potential 
---
Why?
---
i mean like i didnt saw any around me and dont want to just randomly buy something (best would be if someone had experience with it)
---
Yep. I hate Flashlights enough to not really sympathize, but it does suck to have this happen 
---
See playing normally, while it sucks, is still ok. Playing like a jerk and making sure you get all the points but they get none is where I draw the line. 
---
Thank you for making the game not terrible. 
---
Bubba = EZ Deppip
---
I wasn't sure how her puke worked when I did it, I didn't realise it was a charge that went down, I thought she could just shoot for so long and immediately stop so I didn't wanna take the risk
---
Hello! 
---
This is intended.
---
See you in the fog :)
---
I haven't had that problem at all, matchmaking has been pretty solid for me so far, with some high ping lobbies showing up. But no bugged games with only 3 survivors though.
---
Wait...
---
#WHAT?!
---
Slugging isn’t bad against overly altruistic teams but if they know it’s bait then it’s useless. 
---
However, being a jerk because you can is when it’s messed up. 
---
Hello, 
---
To unlock the trophy, you must achieve a Merciless Victory, which consists in a double pip, not a 4K.
---
OHHHHHHH
---
^ yeah I’m confused on this too?
---
Usually I’ll go easier if there’s only 3 survivors because it’s so much more difficult but if they bring bps then those bitches better be ready for the farm of their life. 
---
With what killer?
---
Hex: Thrill of the Hunt Tier 4
---
Good luck with the new pipping system!
---
I've not heard that, but I did notice her corrupt purge sound delays sometimes. I had her chasing me with an unexpected corrupt purge at one point and the sound played while she was chasing me. Don't know whether that's an add-on though, haven't played her yet
---
i always see this i dont understand what a reward is supposed to be exactly?
---
Np. It's actually still a potentially useful perk for me. It would allow me to have more of a chance to find them when I drop frenzy. Thanks! Also I recommend giving Legion a try. I don't find him anywhere near as boring or OP as people say.
---
The beard maketh the Jake.
---
200 iq 
---
I'll take worse resolution for better framerate any day.
---
I would say forget about decisive strike because it's not as good as it used to be. If you feel like you're doing well in your games you can get David King for dead hard and We're gonna live forever. Former is a good high skill exhaustion perk, latter helps you farm.
---
Otherwise if you want more useful perks rush Meg. Sprint burst is baby's first exhaustion perk and adrenaline is dogshit overpowered.
---
For survivors the meta is basically adrenaline, one exhaustion perk, and two perks of your choice. Those two perks can be a healing perk (we're gonna make it, botany, etc), I like leader, prove thyself, resilience, balanced landing, self care, iron will, etc. Hope that helps.
---
If I were you rn I would run maybe iron will, resilience, self care, and a healing perk or maybe calm spirit
---
What a joke.
---
spirit 
---
When Jane gets hit, sometimes she will say "Ahhh haaah, oh dammit ahhh" really quietly.
---
Were there Adept issues on PS4? I got both achievements..
---
use Borrowed Time with We're going to live forever so you can get good unhook bonuses. Plus people will love you for it
---
How about I do when I see them 
---
Which is the point I'm making. Half of them? The moment they see or even get a hint of you coming they've urban evaded off somewhere into the ether.
---
Especially the PS4 survivor community. Good god what a boring lot to go up against 80 percent of the time.
---
so is it confirmed bug? cause no exaggeration the survivor vaulted it probably 20 times within a minute and no block
---
THIS IS GONNA BE MY ENDGAME CHAT STARTER WHEN I PLAY HER
---
yup, I totally agree. it's not like the graphics are that good anyway.
---
I mean sometimes aye there's a problem survivor you need off the table, that is just part of it. However when there's no need to and you're just being a jerk that's different. 
---
However I wouldn't say that doing gens while one teammate is getting chased is 'gen rushing'. That's just playing the game.
---
You must be blind then
---
Program called MLGA: make lobbies great again
---
Hahahah are you kidding me what do you want survivors to do run in a straight line nd it’s not my fault you de pip get better at the game and stop being shit 
---
Didn't always work. I got Adept Jane but I killed all 4 with plague with her 3 perks and only her 3 perks and didn't get it. Appears to be random.
---
why would i care if furries think i sound like a jackass LOL
---
skill checks are way smother I noticed which makes it much easier.
---
Ps4. Perks like Dark Sense and Alert are not working consistently. The Spirit shows so faint sometimes you can barely see her. On the ski resort it's happened more often. Trapper and Huntress havent shown at all on some levels. 
---
I'm disappointed with this map. The temple in the middle is cool, but the rest just feels like a mish-mash of features. This part especially.
---
An entire indoor temple would've been cool, or at least not just pasted on top of Red Forest. Babylon wasn't anywhere near Chernobyl.
---
Yes but Rin is a teenager, (not sure which year) but she's like 6'1 she's probably taller than Freddy (granted Freddy is a Manlet)
---
What happened to Spirit? 
---
Spied wasn’t so much a nerf as it was QOL
---
I remember when totems were first released. Compared to then and now it's night and day. Honestly, the spawn of the totems are so much better I don't think they need to be in the centre of attention (opinion) at the present moment. We could ask developers to give us some statistics such as which map/realm all five totems are cleansed by the time game ends and perhaps ask if they have any prior archived statistics of when the totems were released for comparison. 
---
I know where this is going :(
---
Hurtful
---
Laurie and Feng min sounds the best, the rest sounds so weird.  
---
I too have had this happen on ps4
---
I wonder who she mains. Oh what am i saying its obviously kate.
---
Didn't they reduced the range on spies? And spirit now loses all of her power gauge when she gets stunned, her husk makes an ear rape glass breaking sound when she phases or vaults, and her phasing audio is map wide.
---
It’s the game’s fault but you could’ve just mind-gamed then
---
Yeah if you play as the plague, you will quickly realize that the cooldown is a bit brutal sometimes. Gotta just sit there and stare at them jamming M1/R2 after puking lol
---
u/Siberlily look at this locker juke and teamwork. 10/10
---
Nah, I'd personally say Meg was 5'2, Rin 5'8 with Adiris being 7'8ish 
---
There's a difference between recolored hair and recolored fucking lips.
---
I love the colours, why she CHUNKY tho
---
the true most ambitious crossover event in history
---
You must have a fetish towards manly looking women. Jane has a strong square jaw line and her eyebrow bone sticks out (characteristics of a men) and so much more I can list. But im about to play dbd with pretty characters unlike jose, bye now ! :D 
---
Anyone who mains Quentin has my respect, in game boi has a face only a mother can love
---
Hell i usually farm 3v1s anyway
---
Agreed. and i wasn't really refering to the act of slugging, more so those situations where the game just started and there's 1 guy on the hook and the other 3 are slugged at the killer shack lol
---
Ah rip that sucks. Hope they fix it!
---
The Evil Dead perks are still in the KYF lobby lmao 
---
How to avoid getting dodged for bringing items 101
---
Micheal Myers would just be absolutely silent, maybe the pianos go louder for a bit as he falls, but then it goes back to normal.
---
Git gud
---
“Meglets, will they ever learn?”
---
still there! 
---
Having just bought the Spirit I thought losing her charge when stunned was by design. Glad to know it's not!
---
Slightly, but IMO it makes sense as you wouldn’t be able to even get to whoever made the noise before they were gone before. 
---
Yeah, I did notice that. Also noticed the glass thing, and I wouldn’t know about the phasing thing since I was playing with prayer beads. Thanks for the heads up 
---
The entity hasn’t blocked any windows since the new patch.
---
Five Nights at Myers' 2
---
Imagine playing with the perks you want and having people attack you because of that
---
I think Adiris is wearing heels, but I'd say Meg is like 5'5 because 5'2 is bordering midget and Meg is a college track member and would be Average size.
---
Bullet Hell Plague is the true test of your dodging skills.
---
It's an amazing drawing, no doubt, but why didn't you decide to bring in some Nick Castle as well?
---
That was the biggest brain play I’ve ever seen in this game 
---
So witty.  Now go run along and hide in tall grass with the rest of the P3 Claudettes who think they're good at the game cause they held M1 or R1 for an entire match. :)
---
Yeah, I got 4 kills and no trophy either. I was wondering if they changed it so that you need a "merciless victory" with the new pip system? Or did they acknowledge that there is a bug?
---
pretty hard to mind game the cow tree loop lol, any loop that isnt an infinite and i would agree with you
---
Could you make any more *noise*?!
---
(Gets shocked by the Doctor) 
---
…I guess so. 
---
you just need to stand closer to the tree to cleanse it. 
---
Nice job!
---
please perk this! 
---
My oh my, you're quite the child, I see. Well, fuck me for enjoying a specific art style, I guess. Also, you still have not answered my question, so allow me to repeat myself:
---
Why is it you feel that way, exactly?
---
Type of Bug: Lobby
---
Description: I get booted out of literally every lobby with a message that the game couldn't validate the host's account through easy andi-cheat.
---
Steps to reproduce: Go into a lobby and try to start a game
---
Expected result: You start a game.
---
Actual result: You get kicked out of the lobby and get an error
---
Reproduction rate: I have a 100% reproduction succes rate over roughly 10 tries.
---
One that is not stack in the past.
---
The problem with 120s is that basically is a 120s window where you can't get picked up. I do agree that the stun time needs to be longer. Before the stun time meant that you could get to another window or reach another loop and run that. Now it can only activate by a hook and there really isn't all that much near a hook that can stop you from getting hooked again especially if the killer has enduring.
---
If I reworked it, I would make it so that if you get downed within like maybe 50 seconds of being unhooked, your ds will activate the moment you get picked up regardless of if it happens a minute since you got unhooked or a few seconds from you bleeding out. It then lasts until you get get healed from the dying state. I'd even want to include the ability to recover from the dying state, but I that at that point it could be op.
---
Just use your power 5head

Unique survivor emotes when devs?
---
I love Nick Castle! I appreciate the compliment. 
---
The issue with that is it's hard, for me at least, to bring 4 different people into one. I was mostly going for the look from the original. If anything, we do get a little bit of Castle's mouth and eyebrows with my upload. 
---
It's really cringe and weird as fuck. Not to mention how immature the furries are.
---
The most important thing, however, is that it normalizes bestiality. I don't care if the wolf has abs and a human penis. You're sexualizing a fucking animal.

Concerning the last sentence, Amanda.
---
She's naive, impatient, and doesn't think things through 100% of the time. Perfect candidate for sloppy saw traps.
---
a mother and her daughter
---
When a friend introduced me to the Evil Dead universe he told me to skip the first movie. I really enjoyed the sequel, Army to Darkness and the show. Shame it got canceled
---
Sam Raimi is probably on the phone ready to take that license away from them. Lol.
---
I think the only real problem is it is effected by enduring. Maybe also should not count down while in a chase. 
---
For the most part, I will play a normal game unless I get a farming request. Otherwise good luck, have fun.
---
They're wasting a shit load of time then. Just run unbreakable or something if that happens. 120 is also way too long as it moves from being an anti-tunnel perk to an anti-downing that guy at all perk.
---
It isnt strange, they are more inexperienced thus are more likely to guard and secure kills,  particularly if you looped them.
---
&gt;it's hard, for me at least, to bring 4 different people into one
---
Of course, but you hadled it really well!
---
Wish I could draw this good...
---
...Is she? I didn't think she was chunky at all lol
---
LUL the funny thing is we got out .
---
What about achievements?
---
Bruh those are my favorite. It’s those ones that make me just wanna thank the devs for a perfect game. 
---
Depends
---
Its a leather jacket id yiu want julie or frank
---
Susie and joey are just hoodies
---
perfectly timed!
---
Money
---
I prefer not to buy DLC characters
---
See I’m fine with even playing a normal game. Nobody is required to farm. It’s the people who go out of their way to be jerks with 4 bps and taunt the survivors that need a chill pill. 
---
I can feel your pain my friend.
---
How about people who are mad that other people, who paid for the game, are playing the way they want to play it?
---
Yes. Spirit has a bug which she looses her power too. However, that's a bug.
---
Story of my latest wasted escape cake:
---
* Killer finds me instantly and I loop him for a good while. Not a single generator is done. When I go down I see my allies slowly gen tapping or crouch walking around doing fuck all. Hook #1.
---
* Later on people get hooked and I unhook them. They run away from me to do gens that aren't even remotely worked on and even after they're done the gen they still refused to be healed. I have We'll Make It and a Medkit, by the way.
---
* When I get hooked the second time (no pallets ty allies for wasting them all) this one dumbass Claudette kept looping the Killer around my hook and refused to leave so other people could unhook me. From second hook to sacrifice what fun.
---
[check this out, it helps so many people. ](google.com) 
---
Killer: *runs literally any hex or gives me reason to believe they might run NOED* 
---
Me: *with small game* HEX HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL 
---
Real money, just in case anything happens I want a paper trail showing I bought them, and shards are for cosmetics.
---
I currently have 20k shards so I could get DLC with them, but I'd rather get outfits. I did the math and I need 1.4 million shards if I want every outfit. Well on my way!
---
The spirit one was a bug and is patched out in 2.6.2
---
Good luck
---
I mean it stops noobs from playing rank 1. So people can get decent matches
---
Thanks i guess
---
Ahh dang. Thanks for the reply!
---
Perfection.
---
Boo hoo
---
Do gens
---
...yeah. It is. It means you didn't get yourself killed and you did exactly what you were supposed to.
---
Lol ez game baby killer 
---
lol true
---
That was an amazing play. Killer might NEVER slug another survivor again lol
---
Yep same on PS4 after patch got all survivors with only the plaques perks but no achievement clearly still bugged 
---
i can see this as a problem for newer players coming into the game \^\_\^ 
---
Rip
---
Now you see, THAT'S the answer I was looking for. Something I can actually read that makes sense.
---
Now let's see... well, you'll be happy to know that although I WAS part of the "porn" part of the furry fandom, but I have moved on from that and am no longer interested in it.
---
I do see why you find it strange and unsettling, that's a perfectly normal reaction. It's like the MLP porn... fucking bizarre (no, I did not find that appealing in the slightest).
---
And yeah, the "immature" and "cringe" factors do make sense. I've seen my fair share of unironic "OwO"s and "UwU"s. Though you do need to keep in mind that not EVERYONE in the fandom is immature or ungodly horny. There are people who just 100% normal but happen to enjoy the artstyle. It's like bronies, but a bit different.
---
Anyways, thanks for finally giving a straight answer. You're one of the few people I've met that I actually want to take back the insults I threw at them.
---
Also, quick fun fact: There are actually not that many furries that are into it for the porn. It's just a very, VERY loud minority. Think of it like, again, My Little Pony or Sonic. Just because those people exist does not mean they represent the entire fandom.
---
Enjoy the rest of your day!
---
P.S. Before you ask, no, I do not own a fursuit.
---
Was legit just gonna say the same thing. LoL
---
and have the different ‘outfits’ just be the various celobites? and will pinhead get involved?
---
Probably because other people had said it before.

---
That is a nice idea. And absolutely, as Pinhead is the face of the Cenobites. 
---
&gt;Could've double backed

Can't double back without line of sight blockers against good survivors unless you want to waste time.
---
She just had to stay closer to the props... to cut the loop closer you should press W+A or W+D and go around it looking moving diagonally looking at the prop. If you go straight and curve only with the mouse as she did you'll cut it much wider. ZubatLEL provides a good example on his stream.
---
Also she kept truing to puke wich slowed her down significantly.
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
I forgot to mention I think one reason why I prefer to use iridescent shards is because I’m exclusively a console player
---
The Legion is Fine as long as you're not toxic, in my opinion. I play a lot of legion and I've never got or had complaints.
---
1.9.3? 
---
I had the same thing happen to me, but on a survivor side. Just me and Claudette left, one gen to do and I get on the ground. Billy leaves me to look for her and I see she’s just hiding in different lockers in a building near the hatch. She was waiting for me to bleed out to escape. Billy came right before I died, let me off his shoulders and we went to look for Claud together :) she died, he gave me the hatch. Killers like you are the real MVP. 
---
you can access the game files via pc easily , to get this on xbox/ps4 would take too long and not be worth it when you get perma banned.
---
correct 
---
To be fair that's usually the survivors' fault but the killer should recognize, not only are they ending the game fast and wasting the bonus from the bps, but they destroyed their chase category, sacrifice too cause only 1 hook each, deviousness because no ability being used and brutality because you only hit each person twice. So basically you used your bps so they can waste it on not getting any points. Really screws every one over
---
bad ass, have him imitate survivor noises or able to switch between two killers
---
Repost, neato mosquito .
---
Hell yeah!!
---
I stay even when all the rest leave, always. 
---
Same here. I like having a paper trail with Sony. 
---
I play survivor too. But guess what? You're damn right 
---
Uhh... It’s clean and has no cuts duh? /s
---
His abilities can relate to torturing the survivors without downing them to get a myers like level of the ability or something 
---
It would have to be executed in a way that Survivors could really only soft counter, in other words it'd be genuinely convincing. 
---
you get banned over that but you can camp...
---
Yeah but Tapp is a veteran police detective, that hardly implies he's a pushover. He's old and a bit out of shape, so he might be the weaker of the trio, but he still has training and a lot of experience.
---
I doubt it too, and all the perks used by player is fully known by BHVR, its just cool for newer players (like myself) to get a birds eye view of which per to try first.
---
Pachislot?! Really?!
---
I don't get it, can you explain the joke?
---
give him the pig’s ability to crouch tho  just to make it more convincing as they’re supposed to be just humans
---
*Michael stalks me*
---
Me: Not my problem
---
Or
---
Killer: Spirit
---
Me: *sees hex totem, but there is no Ruin*
---
Me: *Cleanses anyways*
---
Hex: Haunted grounds
---
I do agree on survivors faults. A lot of people say that 4 good survivors would be a good killer. 
---
That’s one of the worst games imo because it’s not fun for any side. Rescuing with no back up plan really fucks up the game. 
---
Overall I don’t expect people to always farm but don’t be fucking crumpets or super fun killer (pun intended). 
---
I tried, this tree position doesn't allow for any angle.
---
What a nice Trappy Boi

I’d love that! 
---
I prefer Blood Warden but it needs a buff. Give us 120 seconds like hope! Enough time to go to both exits.
---
I'm new to the game, and a little confused, do you just have a perk that allows you to completely recover?
---
DEW IT
---
Yeah definitly not the Susie bod...
---
I usually find the killer and see if he's cool to farm first, if not I just kms or dc.
---

Hi it me
---
I wouldn't wanna play too much with Exposed, but i feel a giant sword in the back could warrant it, with reach, to make up for the slower speed. Or monsters in the otherworld could slow survivors down like clown bottles.
---
I have plenty of shirtless ones posted already.
---

---
I never used DS until the update, I don't need to adapt. I'm just saying the perk is completely useless. Its beyond situational. Ive used it in maybe 30 matches since the update and I never even came into play in over 20. And the killer had enduring all but 2 times I got to use it. 2/30 success rate is completely useless. They should've just removed it from the game instead of making another perk nobody will every use. Its just adding insult to injury that they've buffed noed instead of nerfing it.

Google ‘Bara’, but careful as its NSFW
---
Save the best for last, brutal strength, devour hope, sloppy butcher. Flask of bleach and ether are his best add ons and I also use bottle of chloroform a decent amount as it increases the cloud they have to run through and makes hitting survivors easier. Throw bottles at places where you know survivors are looking to loop. Most times, they’ll be so worried about the gas that they’ll let you get an easier hit instead for some reason. 
---
Xbox suffered as well, I stopped playing the game because of those graphics glad it’s fixed. 
---
Unbreakable has come in clutch so many times for me i love it
---
Doesn't even matter with the current matchmaker, it seemingly ignores rank anyway. Every second game, the killer is either rank 15 or 1, with the survivors being around 8, or the other way around.
---
Im sorry to say this, But you outplayed legit no one and put it in a montage, there is not even any interesting edits

Yes, I really am. You don't have to buy any of the dlc, other than licensed characters (understandable). There is 3 - 4 months worth of time to grind out 18,000 shards for both characters in between chapters. I play anywhere from 2 - 4 (maybe more on days off) hours a day, and had enough shards to buy both new characters and a nice sweater for Claudette, all for the low low cost of free. Considering how much work they actually put in to new killers/survivors, broken or not, they could easily make it so you have to pay real money for each dlc. If you don't want the new characters, you can get their perks from the shrine for 2,700 shards or less whenever they pop up.
---
You *especially* don't have to buy cosmetics. They have very little impact on the enjoyment of the game. Most "exclusive" sets they release also come with a slightly changed version that doesn't cost auric cells. They look as good, if not better, than the set that is exclusive to auric cells. Take Trapper's road rage set, for instance. Yeah the black exclusive one is cool, but the brown one covered in blood is way cooler, and costs shards/less auric cells. 
---
Love 'em or hate 'em, Bhvr has spent 2 years and 9 months updating and improving this game. I have no problem spending 10 bucks to grab a couple nice cosmetics or a new chapter if it means they continue to support this game, especially since they no longer have funding from a publisher.

---
Good luck 
---
thanks for the view ;)
---
OH NO YOU DON'T MEGHAN!
---
Great work!
---
just wait and trash it, that’s ridiculous 
---
man ripley has a survivor would be so awesome also
---
That was nice. 
---
Actually it took me longer the other day to start a game as killer. 4/5 mins waiting to start a lobby and then 3/4 mins as survivors came and went. Swf has always had long wait times. Adding the que system to killer lobbies can only make that worse... I am assuming here. I cannot see why this que and wait on killer lobbies has been introduced. Nor read or thought of an argument that seems reasonable for it either. 
---
Although if one crops up I'll change my opinion. 
---
That's why I stopped using the perk long ago. They never really leave you on the ground for long enough. Kind of wish it would get a buff. Maybe it should have been removed and implemented into DS or something.
---
That’s what they do though
---
CosmicBrain
---
Yeah. Once per match. It's name is Unbreakable, and it belongs to Bill.
---
Sounds pretty hot
---
Eh honestly imo the new ranking system almost encourages DCing. If you don’t have an awesome game and are mad about something why stay in the game? You’re gonna depip anyways. Get farmed in the beginning of match? DC. Get tunneled? DC. I’ve seen way more DCing personally since the update 
---
haha yeah, she ability can be a reference to her wanting to keep everyone alive and have the ability to make the killer drop a survivor they’re carrying! “get away from her you bitch”
---
well done. thats clutch thinking right there.
---
No mither, resilience, prove thyself and a trusty toolbox.
---
Platform: PS4 
---
Type of Bug: in-game
---
Description: if the killer runs Dark Devotion borrowed time doesn't trigger 
---
Also 10 min wait for 200 ping lobbies 😍
---
It still looks like shit on the og PS4. Everything looked fine before the update smh
---
If they change it though I fully expect them to put in place a mandatory second objective. Nerfing or changing it....all that does is make survivors definitely not cleanse totems bc there is no threat. And that speeds up games which us the opposite of what makes a fun game. I have no fun mouse 1 ing a few gens, maybe looping a bit, then escaping nor do I have fun downing 1 guy and 3 gens popping with the other 2 popping pretty fast after.
---
Tbh I would rather they fix problems with perks you have to take like Ruin. I love ruin but I hate that I HAVE to take it or say goodbye to having enough time to find survivors and get momentum. There are a ton of fun builds I would love to do but because perks like ruin exist you cant do them. Not enough space.
---
With survivor there are almost no perks that I would consider you have to take. Or at the very least no perks where there arent alternatives that are about as good but do not stack.
---
Though I couldn't tell you what is balanced.
---
I appreciate that! I believe you can draw good, too! Just keep practicing. 
---
Swiftly followed by 🤮
---
Yeah it's pretty rare that a Killer goes for slugs like that anymore.  
---
Running around the same pallet forever wasn't necessarily an issue with the game, that was just the killer continuing to try to vomit on the survivor. She kept slowing down to get the puke off. Had she just walked at the survivor, they would've had to drop the pallet or get hit. Huntress suffers from the same mind game.
---
Some loops are undeniably stupid I agree, but I don't think a killer playing a semi-safe loop incorrectly is cause for outcry about game imbalance. 
---
Huh
---
Personally I’d like to see him sprint on  all 4 creepy like he does. Something between Billy and Pig would be great. Would love to see a high mobility/stealth killer.
---
I’m less likely to leave if you’re camping someone in the hook, I’ll stay and gather the others go use the hook altogether and get the poor soul pure camping out safely
---
Yeah generator and bbq aura’s have been super faint since this last patch makes it hard to patrol when you can barely see where the gens are :/ 
---
Ranked has really never mattered because of that fact.  Unsure if BHVR's attempts to make it more srs are to justify giving it rewards in the future or what.  
---
Well that’s kinda rude,  you can say that about any cosplay
---
Having to rely on having a window nearby sounds horrible, almost impossible even.
---
Fast vaulting also gives away your position.
---
One of my ideas was the killer’s power makes them stronger for every remaining required generator. They’re faster, swings recover quicker, they break pallets quicker (or just ignore them when no gens have been done) etc, and slowly tone down to a killer that is weak.
---
The survivor’s perks would center around a similar mechanic, all of their action speeds are faster and get slower as more gens are completed, down to slightly slower than a normal survivor.
---
(Or flip this dynamic, and have them scale up in power, which probably would work better)
---
Dang, you beat me 😂
---
with the new ds, i love running unbreakable, ds, deliverance and dead hard.
---
if they’re camping i can get off the hook with deliverance which then gives 1 of 3 options:
---
- i lose the killer
---
- i get down and slugged, get myself back up with unbreakable
---
- i get down and picked back up and use ds.
---
dead hard is there so i can escape the killer easily.
---
What you did won't get you banned.
---
However I mostly came to point out your comment "if I wasn't aware of the terms of service"
---
In any case game rules, laws, terms of service. Ignorance isn't an excuse nor would it stop you from getting banned or in trouble. Just some life advice always be aware of repercussions of your actions before you commit them.
---
Also Oink!
---
Lol you people are in your own bubble world, they literally told you that it's fine, it's in a good place, there's appropriate counters, and they don't see the false equivalency with survivor perks that this dumbshit community makes. 
---
Overpriced compared to a few years ago. This is the pricing model now thanks to Fortnite and League. At least they don't have a battle pass or loot boxes 
---
We Are All Down With THE THICCNESS 
---
You can see they’re playing on Xbox
---
Lol @ all these replies not noticing it says 2 seconds
---
Damn that was so cool, nice! The scream of anger and/or pain from The Huntress... I wonder how that player felt to see that being pulled off.
---
You did the right think. The Nea apears to be a good player and kinda carried the team on her back. Survivors like this Jeff are really selfish and end up fucking their team over and even taking the game hostage. So i think you were fair and altought you could've have killed the Nea you were nice by giving her the hatch. The only problem? You were plating with The Pig, you should've teabagged him for a little bit.
---
I think they think you're serious.
---
Rude yes, but that isn't mutually exclusive to the truth.
---
Outstanding move
---
Not the hair I picture when I think Jake, but still very good cosplay.
---
The real question is what tier map and what addons does it have?
---
Yeah your right I should be more thoughtful of things I accept. I'll keep that in mind from now on.
---
Are these already in the game? Sorry haven’t played dbd in awhile 
---
i've seen this happen on ps4. 
---
Dwight triggered the afk killer with pew pew contrantly resulting in him getting hooked till dead
---
then a meg picked up his flashlight once all the gens were done, realized she fucked up and bleed out cuz the killer wouldn't let anyone heal her 
---
she was downed in the middle of the map and stood no chance as only 1 gate was opened ahahah 
---
\^\^\^bleeegh
---
That’s always awful when they do nothing and still manage to get out :(
---
Legion sucks
---
the way I see it is that. if you go on Tumblr (well, not anymore, but before they removed all NSFW stuff) and search for that fandom, what do you find?
---
if what you find is primarily NSFW shit, then i think its a poor excuse to say only a small part of the fandom is a horny virgin. 
---
when i'd search furry to test this, the vast majority of the shit that popped up was NSFW. when joining furry servers, there were channels for NSFW art and roleplay.
---
even if the entirety of the fandom might be this disgusting, it doesnt change the fact that its also really cringe, and their behavior is... just weird
---
Who said I didn't tea bag him?
---
Pig main = Big brain
---
No, most of the community doesn't. We all play for fun and bloodpoints 
---
Ok, gonna post it now. Thanks for the motovation! o/
---
Sorry, i didn't mean copyrighted. I just meant that  its well known amongst my friends as "The President Claudette" 
---
Your flat analogy doesn't make sense since this is a video game and not an apartment.
---
This is truly amazing!
---
*Laughs in Franklin's Demise and Overwhelming Presence with smart gameplay^(and nurse for extra salt)*
---
Haha jokes. Yeah I use this outfit because it looks classier than the the prestige shirt and I generally am harder to see than normal. 
---
Aka Freddy’s Fire Up..
---
Except not shit and barely noticeable 
---
Same. By the way, the same glitch happened to me with unbreakable. 
---
I have a special place in my heart for Bill. As killer they are always helpful to the other survivors and, usually, have bad luck with me. I play Bill as helpful as possible. 
---
Are we talking about fortnite? Who cares about cosmetics.  And considering I haven’t purchased a killer or survivor since the pig and tapp, tells me this isn’t a cash grab. You can’t complain about things being cash grabs if they give you the option to earn it by playing the game.  And you always had to buy the charity dlc’s the proceeds went to a charity, so I think you’re confused.
---
Did you achieve a merciless victory? Or a ruthless victory? You need to achieve a merciless victory in order to unlock the achievement. Since the rank update, you can get a 4K and only safety pip or 1 pip. Before the update, a 4K would’ve got you merciless most likely. That’s not the case anymore.
---
I buy the DLCs with money, just better value for me imo. Usually I use shards for extra BPs from the shrine 
---
Yeah, like I said, it's a LOUD minority. That's the big issue. I completely understand your reasoning. And again, not EVERYONE is "cringe", but I do see why you see it that way... Just at the very least, I say that if you meet someone and become friends with them and at some point they mention they're a furry, don't dismiss them right away. But if they start engaging in bizarre behaviour, I understand if you want to part ways with them. I have a few friends who are furries (both pro-porn and anti-porn) and none of them act in that "cringe" way. 
---
Well, this was a nice chat. If there's anything else you'd like to add, please do! If not, I guess this is where we part ways. Either way, have a nice day!
---
And sorry, seven bucks over the span of three months doesn’t hurt my wallet. If it does, you should probably find a better job
---
Does bill not talk in l4d?
---
No worries mate, it's not much, but have my upvote! 
---
My man. Playing Pig allows for some sweet, humping karma ;)
---
I don't main trapper but I associate Saminations trapper song with him, I sing it silently while playing trapper sometimes 
---
I see you are a person with good taste. 
---
Yeah exactly, altho the matchmaking is off atm. You feel really the difference when you play against lower ranks. And when you feel that you play more relaxed and you can indeed double/triple hook every1.
---
These addons are good for bp farming imo
---
You're treading some dangerous waters there my friend 
---
True, but so is killing you.  \*equips Mori\*
---
NOED is more bullshit
---
You could have picked the female legion and one of the many dudes.....but no....you just thought frame 1 claudette buldge was the way to go
---
There needs to be some kind of counter to items, even if its a tech perk like franklin's. IMO its an aweful execution of a counter to items but is somewhat of a neccesary evil.
---
Amen to that. I usually try to make progress and act as a sort of "Commander" to the team. They're too disorganized otherwise. "A few years in the service'll slim 'em down and shut 'em up."
---
Someone who loves clown as well. Wohoo! 
---
Honestly I think noed would be good to use only if- nah I tried coming up with a reason but there isn't one. Noed really sucks to play against if your not a survivor main.
---
Candyman
---
It wouldn't even tell me the killer wait time, i waiting 5 min to no avail.
---
How do the majority of a 4v1 game play killer? You would easily expect survivors in theory to outnumber them 4 to 1
---
Gotta also use add-ons for faster crouching
---
A 4K is a 4K kiddo

Ever since the update I've only been able to get in one match. I try to cue for a lobby and it gives me infinite loading screen of death and despair. I just want to play the game but instead it denies me. 
---
It's shocking to me that bhvr (who are well known to be shitty devs but still) don't see this as a major issue where there are currently NO high rank survivors that killers from that range are matched with brown and yellow ranks. 
---
an excuse for survivors to gang up around the hooked survivor and complain post game instead of doing gens
---
Dwight cause he's freaking adorable lol. And Spirit because I love pulling ppl off gens/totems/hooks/etc. Plus she can jumpscare decently well. Not as good as Myers but pretty well lol
---
Reupload, except have his falling sound be the locker opening squeak and the landing be the locker slam sound

Description: Spirit’s phase walk. Whenever Spirit is stunned by pallet, her phase meter resets. I don’t know if this was a purposeful change in the latest update or if this is a bug. If this was a purposeful change, it was not mentioned in the patch notes. The phase walk meter didn’t reset upon stuns before.

G string i bet, shes a g string kinda girl
---
I’m not going to argue I guess
---
or just DC. It's not fun.
---
Legion isn't fun people DC on them.
---
Good thing she didn't pick you up first
---
Can you imagine her thought process when you got back up?
---
Shadowborn buff looks good!
---
Why does ace always represent the toxic survivor in these? When I hear "Toxic Survivor" Ace is one of the last people I think of
---
Yes I realize this but if people see this list they might start actually thinking instead of regurgitating some youtubers talking points about how survivors control the game etc.
---
You can go back and pick it up when you escape though
---
The main reason for using these add-ons basically. I mean, as a Pig Main i rarely rely on crounching, so crounching a few seconds faster is only useful when taunting toxic survivors. 
---
if you are a survivor that normal-ish. As a killer you should be getting more. though some killers struggle in certain point categories while other don't even try and max it out. Deviousness is where I'm guess you are lacking points and that has to do with the killers power being used and you get a bonus in it if no one survives. Someone like the trapper will usually get little to no deviousness points. Its rare that people are constantly walking into your traps and you get a very little amount for setting them. Yet someone like doc or freddy will find they are almost always at 8k deviousness points at the end of the game
---
 [https://isthereanydeal.com/game/deadbydaylight/info/](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/deadbydaylight/info/) 
---
It happens sometimes when say, the killer just downed you and is going after some survivor who showed themselves.
---
I would like to report this (whole thread as bug) [https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b4b1bu/please_stop_matching_me_against_red_rank_killers/]
---
Depends on your setup. It's situational for sure, but it's a possibility that wasn't available before.
---
Have you tried buying the latest cosmetics? That should fix the problem.
---
No he's aldwight
---
You should check out the CJ-Tech move. Straight 200 iq play. 
---
on non other than good ol leatherface I assume
---
Or people are exploiting it and don't want their free SWF win card to be removed.
---
Lol I’m just addressing what’s in the post. If NOED is Adrenaline’s counter, then yeah by that logic if Adrenaline gets nerfed so should the counter. Im not even complaining about NOED, just like I don’t think killers should be complaining about Adrenaline (with the only possible exception being the wake up for Freddy)
---
Or that yea
---
You thought wrong.
---
I agree that it's especially bad form to camp in those matches. Other than that though, any other expectation would seem a bit too entitled, IMO. I don't think using specific items should obligate your opponent to give you an easier match, some players just want to play straight up every time, and I don't really blame them. Personally, I have an hour and a half of game time on weekdays, and I don't always want to play just one game. 
---
20k bp
---
I'll DC if he moonwalks me too. It's so infuriating when you loop him well at one pallet and just moonwalks to get me afterwards.
---
You said it partner.
---
They changed the perk so that all tiers provide the exposed and mori effect as opposed to only tier 2 &amp; 3. 
---
The speed buff was just poorly translated in the notes, similar to how distressing was written to provide 100% bonus bp for all tiers.
---
I thought you were trolling at first but judging by your comment history you're completely serious. You just want DBD matches to be five survivors doing gens and escaping. You're a whiny tool and I'm glad nobody listens to you.
---
Are you using reshade? The colors a more vibrant.
---
This is always a good one. I seem to always get a streamer in my game when I do this so I get to watch them getting jump scared in the VOD
---
Why is Thicc MILF a brute? 
---
resilience
---
 spine chill
---
 prove thy self 
---
&gt; fast vaulting gives away your position
---
The old Lithe required you to be in a chase, so the killer probably had an idea of where you were. 
---
And while I don't really do this, you can use Lithe with Quick &amp; Quiet to avoid that. Use Dance With Me as well and you can maybe end the chase. 
---
Also I really doubt the killers hear the music 🤔
---
Eh thats true, but he doesn't say any actual words in DBD.
---
I think we all did 
---
I agree, remove the invulnerability frames from Dead Hard and make it possible for Dead Hard to stun small Killers.
---
All the small Killers then have to do is turn around and smack him.
---
I'd prefer a similar sound queue to breaking a hex signifying all dulls being cleansed. Hexes are balanced around survivors not knowing how many totems remain and adding a UI counter would nerf them further. And on the occasion I use Ruin, it still spawns in a survivors actual asshole.
---
Nice work! I'm glad you posted.
---
She does feel a lot like legion, because those DCs at the start of the game throw me off when I think its Legion.
---
shhh let them have their answers lmao
---
I thought you were going to pop that gen and at the same time as someone else and everyone was going to get adrenaline. This was still great though
---
Not to mention the hate mail you get from swf players when you kill everyone fair and square. 
---
Spirit is way more fun imo. Also the second best killer overall and first best on console.
---
what would his ability be? a fear like the doctor? shooting bees?
---
I believe distressing does now provided 100% at all tiers
---
I thought they changed it so enduring didn’t effect DS, this is just depressing.
---
I would love a secondary objective. Anyone who says that games "aren't fast" has never played a killer that isn't Nurse, Billy,  or Huntress. Without Ruin. At rank 1. The speed at which generators pop is fucking ludicrous.
---
Broken, they came with legion.... u need 4 hits or 3 to get a kill... and now they add this killer. 0 skill using the vomit on someone and killing him.... i mean, wtf 
---
Same i cant find a  game as survivor even with 100 ping since 20 minutes. Great job bhvr.
---
for the jumpscares, make him able to manuver over and under terrain and climb it too 
---
Great work! Looks super neat 
---
have you tried uninstalling?
---
Thanks man, I'm gonna try some more I think, very thankful for encouraging me!
---
no clue, but def something with BEES!
---
I do agree that you shouldn’t be obligated to farm and if you don’t then you don’t deserve to be burned or some shit. I suppose I just say don’t camp and tunnel and sprinkle in that little bit more toxicity to really ruin it just because there’s bps. 
---
Maybe I expect too much. :/
---
Thank you so much!
---
Most of the survivor players would have quit. They already DC against anything that tickles their butthole the wrong way as it is.
---
They still have The Walking Dead game up and it doesn't even exist anymore. It tanked so they stopped making it.
---
What about the one that lets her Mori her obsession? That sounds like it'd be a lot of fun. 
---
I said this just a few hours after the release of the new dlc. No one was saying it before because they want their free exploits to not be talked about. If It's not that it's because they think or thought I was making shit up. I've got better things to do with my time than make shit up.
---
ahh I can spot the hair from a mile away and thru the fog
---
I love the hair, I think it fits well with his backstory because he's supposed to be some sort of rich spoiled dude who didn't want any of it. I really wish he had a haircut that didn't make him look like a hobo.
---
The game is super fun and very enjoyable. I 100% recommend it but I'm warning you that if you aren't really good at taking in toxicity, you might want to consider your choice because dbd is without a doubt one of the most toxic communities I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of them 
---
Weird, I see most people praise this killer. Interested in explaining why? 
---
I think 28 is pretty reasonable 
---
I'm working rn but as soon as I ca get the chance I'll go over it
---
yeah it is very very situational. 
---
Okay, to be fair tho, the second photo is bought down a bit so it can fool you into thinking the hair isn’t that different. In reality, the hair is inch taller. So it makes more of a difference then this meme leads you to believe, but the meme is still valid in its own right.
---
Its that bad. People just vomit on you close range and M1 swing you. It's not fun. I would rather face legion.

Obligatory “doing gens, you?“ joke
---
It’s the warning she’s picked up her Red vomit, as if her glowing red wasn’t enough of a warning.
---
Ahh man this happened to me the other day while playing. I've always wanted to be able to spectate the killer. Soon as they got unhooked the screen went back to normal
---
Yes, much to my surprise BHVR doesn't include porno intros in game. 
---
/s
---
Some killers can't deal with 360's and pallet loops. So when they find a sruvivor t bagging who loops them for 3 gens, they're going to camp. Guarentee every time you find a bad killer you loop, t bag then send a "GG EZ" afterwards and whenever you die it MUST be because they cheated, or they didn't play fair, or they lag switched, or tunneled or used crutch perks it's NEVER your fault! People camp because you're toxic. Not because they find it fun.
---
Exactly.  As a P3 Kate I must disagree with the Perk part, DWM + Lithe or Head On, Windows For learning the new maps (now I know where all the pallets spawn on the Temple of Purgation by playing 3 games of that map with Windows), and Boil Over...well Boil Over can just be hilarious when killers walk past such obvious hooks and watch them bump into tyres and trees left right and centre 😂
---
This is the best and the worst thing I have ever seen 
---
Just give me your login info and i should have it back in 2 hours!
---
Yeah pretty sure that since the wait times (at peek times) are pretty close, the ratio is about 4 survivors for 1 killer &lt;.&lt; go figure 
---
NOED just became the single biggest crutch perk left in the game with the Decisive rework.  I thoroughly disagree with OP's complaining of the absurdly broken shit they took out the game like bnp, instablind and pallet vacuum but objectively NOED should be revisited.  Killer has never been easier to play than it is now yet every baby killer still runs that shit.  It doesn't matter how balanced the game becomes they will still use their biggest crutch.  If they were to do something about it I would gladly accept every single change they've made to survivors to buff killers.  That is the lone cheap safety net they still use obsessively that should be looked at.  
---
In the context of gameplay you were just a bot. Run to gen. Hold gen button. Repeat. Open exit gate. Leave. You didn’t do too much there not gonna lie. Did you “win”? Yes. Was it an eventuful game? Nope. 
---
It is not easy to throw them damn hatchets, Billy's turn radius with the saw is bs, and nurse can be dodged easily because you vant stop mid-blink.
---
Try verifying your game cache or possibly reinstalling
---
That's the dbd community 99% of people are toxic and act like this game is life
---
Very tall walls and ummm..that's all. Lol her power needs a hitbox like Huntress axes cause that shit takes no skill at all to land.
---
I miss the game F13 used to be, man. So many fun memories, but I don't think this is possible.
---
a dc
---
I love the lithe, dance with me and quick and quiet combo,its soo nasty especially on lerys. I really think boil over needs a buff, dance with me needs a lesser cooldown timer and windows of opportunity is good for beginners or learning a new map but after that it's not super helpful(as much as I love all these perks). Boil over has insane potential and it saddens me to see it just be so weak when it has soo many areas to buff
---
Legion isn't the newest killer anymore. You guys can stop now with the "David can beat them up" shit. Pig is the same size as all of the Legion members yet I didn't see this when she came out with her edgy wrist blade and ineffectual bear traps.
---
close the app
---
You get to play a 3 perk killer lol.  Who cares about items.  You don't need them as survivor anyways.  
---
I mean, depending on which iteration we were talking about BNPs were pretty stupid. The literal instant ones were suuuuuuuuper dumb. On their own the ones with repeated skill checks that went to full were ok on their own, but when people coordinated and brought multiple ones into a game it was just boring as all fuck. 
---
Pallet vacuum was ass. Buggy, never-should-have-been-in-the-game ass.
---
Installing flashlghts (back when you could click on for .5 seconds and blind a killer) were pretty fucking stupid too. 
---
Re Ruin and NOED, i've tried super hard to understand this point of view, but just really can't. Noed is 100% avoidable by either just cleansing totems or leaving the game once the generators are powered. Ruin is easy to cleanse or just power through...neither are really worth a slot on most killers outside of low tier play atm imo.
---
So far as no fun/strong perks, that's really subjective. Tons of people seem to enjoy Dance With Me, Deliverance, Aftercare and Distortion.  
---
Sorry if i sound harsh, but I have a hard time sympathizing with anyone who things pallet vacuums were good for the health of this game. 
---
Negan from the walking dead as a killer. I just love the idea of this charismatic clean guy coming after you.
---
Also a bit more out there, but an individual survivor pack with Dana Scully and Fox Mulder from the X-files. That lore on how they get to the entity would be interesting 
---
It is going crazy on ps4
---
I had that happen twice as survivor too...
---
It seems rather inconsistent too, all she needs is one particle to hit you and the timer begins to tick. It’s almost impossible to dodge it all
---
I mean, I think you are getting irrationally upset. You have to remember, regardless of “killer” or “survivor” title, it’s a 4v1 game. Think about that. You simply can not give survivors perks as strong as the killers. It will always seems perks or nerfs are in the killers favor, and it is because it’s 4v1. *Killers need strong perks and add ons*.
---
I know survivors want to single handedly stomp and bully killers all day. They can. That’s where the skill gap comes in. Add on meta goober perks on top of that and the game becomes a shit show for killers.
---
In comparison, run a group of survivors perkless vs a killer perkless and see how that goes.
---
You don't. Just run and pray to god that this particular Legion isn't the smartest. Or do the ancient hidden technique of Nea/Claudette mains and dc.
---
That was amazing!
---
Ok you need to stop one don’t make assumptions you can’t prove. Because I play fairly and always try to break chase as soon as possible,unless the killers is on my ass, 2 crutch perks shut up yes killers don’t use noed, ruin or anything.I main killer and survivor I go against toxic people all the time as killer and win, you need to get better at the game if you have to camp. 
---
OMG IMAGINE THE PIG CHASING HER
---
I support the devs n the game, so I'll put down some money.
---
I am trolling
---
Good luck getting a 4k while camping at red ranks
---
How about instead of adding Jason we add Pamela. Everyone is like "awww grandma survivor" and then she pulls out a knife
---
Yeah it kinda is easy lmao 
---
What do you mean? good billies don't face that problem only shitty ones such as yourself
---
And nurse can EASILY be dodged. EASILY. 
---
all you proved with this comment is that you have no idea what you're talking about, at all. 
---
I need to know what the doctor and nurse thought when the plague showed up vomming everywhere. I can see the plague believing the entity is a God and her purpose was never to save people from the plague, but to become it and spread it. I think the entity would absolutely play that angle.
---
lmfao couldnt pay me to support this company
---
I'm not saying it works but I'm pretty sure it is considered cheating if it does and if they actually are able to would probably be bannable
---
no but that seems like the best solution
---
Insta blinds, ds, bnp and pallet vaccum were all absurdly overpowered and thank God they were removed. 
---
Oh I'd be pissed hahaha
---
Probably camped. 
---
Yellow ranks btw. 
---
Sorry, I am relatively new to dbd, why do they vault the pallet back and forth then flash lighting, instead of just waiting then normally flash lighting?
---
I don't think a single answer here is serious, looking at them all.
---
Ok we will stop making you play against red ranks but in exchange it will now take you 2 to 3 hours to find a match. Sound good?
---
Survivors can use items over and over to 1%, escape with it and have that item as long as they survive. Some of us take the responsibility of claiming those toolboxes for the entity.
---
You'd be surprised
---
Like was said to killers so many times before DS got nerfed, maybe you just need to adapt and get better.
---
Nah every time I’d down someone they’d wait for me to pick up nd they’d dc
---
Yeah, it should be shift+click ONLY to cancel actions on yourself 
---
Pig is cute while Legion are not.
---
Sees spirit
---
OH hell yeah respect!
---
Sees Quentin
---
Respect lost 
---
The killer is going to break the pallet before picking up the survivor. If you vault at the right time, the killers break pallet command changes to pick up the survivor instead, locking them in the animation giving you time to flashlight stun and allowing the dropped survivor to either run or vault away. 
---
Read all of these replies.
---
Not one of them is serious.
---
(Watch out for the add-on that spawns one survivor on a hook; let me into your steam; trash it, too hard)
---
I honestly don't care.
---
What's difference between waiting 5 hours to a game that I can actually stand a chance on or getting a game in a minute only to literally die in a minute cause the killers much better than me? 
---
I read it in the metaton voice lol
---
Lol, this legion WAS NOT dumb. Hit me twice and then got me a third. He actually had blood hound too. Pretty much a death sentence
---
It checks line of sight within 32m of you, while spawning but it can still spawn a totem within that radius, and sometimes it spawns it on the other side of a wall or object less than 10m from you. So even though you didn't see it as you spawned, if take a few steps in the direction of it... bam! Killer loses a totem. Had a match where as I spawned and the camera circled me, I heard a totem to my characters 10 o'clock, went over there and sure enough, hiding in the bushes next to a tree was Ruin. The totem hiding system still needs a little work.
---
Still better than Adam’s 80’s hair tbh, half a centimeter taller omg so much difference
---
It is hard to dodge it *all* but at the same time, the time it takes broken to build up is pretty significant if she just nicks you with a fleck of vomit one time. 
---
Treating her like huntress and swivelling the camera when she's trying to vom on you is useful. After that she's an M1 killer unless she stops and drinks a font or someone uses the last one while you're mid chase. 
---
Cleansing is probably gonna be a match to match things. I've noticed some Plagues consume fonts right away all  the time while others let them build up so they might get super vomit mid chase. So i'd say just adjust on a per game basis. 
---
you can counter this by not bringing anything
---
Tip" you can always pick it up \^\_\^ 
---
It’s not 
---
They *broke* unbreakable
---
Na. Adrenaline is a strong perk but I just don’t see it as OP. DS was a garbage, OP perk. There’s a fine line between strong and OP.
---
Infectious Fright completely makes trying to go flashlight saves impossible. 
---
Think about it like this even if you die you get slightly better. Why, because you are playing. If you aren't playing the game and instead wait for queues that take hours upon hours to find a match you can't get better and therefore lose any chance of that. Also you wouldn't want 1 match every 5 hours because it's actually really boring. There was one point where I was able to watch the entirety of Deadpool 2 and Venom and came back still sitting in a queue looking for a match.
---
I love that its there. It is forgetful though lol.
---
Ahh alright, thank you. I’m currently on around 700k so I’m kinda close
---
My friends are not interested in this game :( So solo queuing it is
---
You probably did it without STYLE
---
Damn I feel for you
---
Why would you skip the first movie?? Go watch it, now!
---
Nah (good idea) but dont think that would work 
---
(maybe it could but I dont think so)
---
Genuine question, how the shit did you only get partial progress on this lmao
---
Not gonna lie, I expected Jane to come bursting out of the locker due to this comment XD
---
Meta perks are subject to change man. This is every online video game. If you don’t like DS anymore, find a new perk to use. 
---
Yellow ranks dc for anything these days
---
So does Lightborn, but does anyone use both of them? Infectious fright released very recently and I already never see people use it unless they want to try it out because it's new. Even then it's super rare and I'm guessing after a month we'll never see it again(unless they buff it or something). 
---
Do you post at the dbd forum? This is just the kinda comment I’d expect to see there lol.
---
DONG
---
I play killer on console, usually Myer a lot, and I do slug often. If anybody ever were to run Unbreakable I'd be BIG fucked. 
---
What you think that's the gist of it?  I'm pretty sure to not be seen and just hit gens like that requires SOME skill since the killer doesn't just sit in one corner.  Survivors are there to survive, which means getting the fuck out ASAP.  Not run around like little chickens so you can live out your chase fantasies.  Probably one of those guys who intentionally de ranks for the new guys.
---
This is great
---
#P R E A C H
---
Looks like grimace from McDonalds
---
Amen to that brother.
---
I forgot to add this in my description of that idea, but zero-collision is given to the unhooker if the killer qualifies for camping. So basically they can swing all they want and the hits will go right through you as you're unhooking the survivor. Then, as soon as the unhooked survivor lands, you'll both be immune to hits and will receive a speed burst from any hit within the 10 second window.
---
Most definitely this would put a dent in camping and tunneling gameplay-wise. While the pip rank system will take care of it points-wise and rank-wise. Let's hope the Devs consider something like this.
---
I don't have a leadership position but thanks for the feedback
---
that was very smart you had to plan that for a while 
---
It depends on how good the ping is. I’ve had games where I would be in a pallet spamming space bar trying to drop the pallet, but I get hit, and the pallet doesn’t even drop. Note the ping before you start a match, and if you get hit through a pallet drop, remember that and try to drop it earlier.
---
Play testers need to be fired if they have any
---
Thanks for the report!
---
Vaulting the pallet blocks the Break prompt which forces the killer to pick up the slug. Of course if you just wait a moment you’ll have a survivor vaulting right into you, but the whole point of the tech is to catch people mashing Space to break the pallet. 
---
Another good strat is to lurk in the shadows and avoid the killer long enough for them to give up. Don't do anything that will give your possition away. JUST HIDE after 40 min they will give up and you will safety pip.
---
Combat straps had been on the whole design team's radar for a while, but you're welcome =)

Plays Survivor/killer
---
Thanks bud
---
That’s an okay perk but imo not worth it. It’s more of a ‘didn’t play as good, let me get a free kill’ perk. I’ve never tried it with blood warden but you can try. Doesn’t the survivor have to be hooked in order for blood warden to activate? Haunted Grounds can be good if you decide to run an instadown build (Thrill, Haunted, Devour and MYC). Spirit Fury still my favourite. My build for any killer that isn’t Nurse or Spirit is Ruin, BBQ, Enduring and Spirit Fury.

Sorry it isn't super detailed. I'm not sure how it happens. I'll just be switching between my friends and suddenly, 3rd person killer cam.
---
Noed isn't op and has already been massacred since it's release. Literally noed used to be unlimited now way to stop it then was put to a timer in which you would just wait out the timer and hide. Then finnaly was put to a hex because that is the most balanced version

What is this incomplete sentence supposed to mean...
---
I liked the idea of changing ds so it wasn’t a get out of jail free card, and even more so when I found out it was gunna be an anti tunnel perk. 
---
I can’t tell if it’s stupidity or just ineptitude from bvhr when they also make it so that the ‘anti tunneller’ aspect of the rework is totally void by making it last 0.7 seconds by equipping a (often used even before this patch) perk. Crazy that some people still maintain that the changes weren’t a huge nerf. 
---
I would be forced to DC from this world.
---
I can hear Killer's respectful rage from here.
---
Honestly it just needs a rework like for every dull totem left on the map is the amount of people you are allowed to down. For example if there’s 5 totems left you can down everybody 5 times. And if someone left even one only one person gets punished but everyone else is fine.
---
fucking yes, dbd needs POTG
---
Yikes. I haven’t looked really no. That bad huh? 
---
Verify files through steam, likely an update installed incorrectly
---
It turns me on too
---
Appart from on Legion. It is still very much useful on legion. You say nerfed, but with all 4 survivors injured, it actually got a buff. And guess what. Legion is good at keeping survivors injured
---
So by your own admission, NOED isn't OP, you just want it nerfed because you think that is some kind of retaliation against killer mains who single handedly ruined a perk you liked. You actively want to ruin a perk you believe is fine, simply because it will annoy other players.
---
Then I understand your choice. Ace does indeed loom stunning
---
Just every post game say "spit on my mommy". Finally got a killer to reply to me today. "I always spit on my pussy before I eat it" Good game
---
thats a unique opinion, I kinda agree tho, in a way it's more intimidating

nothing important

That's standard price. Ten bucks for what amounts to an Epic skin. 
---
Oh yeah, very bad. Regulars there will tell you Nurse is a balanced killer. I recently saw a post where someone said if there’s 4 DCs, the killer should get 32k bp. People thought it was a good idea.
---
Yeah, I slug on PS4 often for 3 reasons.
---
1. If I find myself finding the same survivor over and over again I’d rather slug them and give them a chance than hook them for the third time. Sometimes it seems like I’m tunneling but unhooked survivors legitimately just end up running into me. 
---
2. There are two survivors left and I want to flush the other one out.
---
3. It’s a SWF that is toxic and I want to cluster them with Cannibal.
---
Type of Bug: Visual, In Game
---
I was playing SWF on The Game map. Last survivor alive with one generator done. I was working on the generator in the bathroom, and would get auditory notifications for skill checks, but the actual skill check would not show up on my screen. Missed every single one, got caught and died. 
---
My friend was spectating and said she saw the skill checks, but they wouldn't show up at all on my screen. 
---
I have never seen this happen before. Anyone else experience this?
---
... Oh my. 
---
That sucks way more. Just the new map or any map.
---
I always try as much as I can to respect everyone's opinions no matter how ridiculous they might be (they're opinions after all) but come on, I think we should all agree that ds, pallet vaccum, insta flashlights etc are insanely overpowered and their departure has definitely improved the games health. Just like how things like iridescent head and prayer beads are op, difference being that these are add ons; ds and pallet vaccum are not 
---
&gt;So by your own admission, NOED isn't OP, 
---
Just because its not op doesn't mean it's not a crutch. Only bad killers use noed to get kills they don't deserve. I want those bad killers to be denied their cheap kills
---
&gt;you just want it nerfed because you think that is some kind of retaliation against killer mains who single handedly ruined a perk you liked. 
---
Yup

The thought process of 'us vs. them' mains in a nutshell

Hrrgn, Kate, I'm tryna sneak around, but I'm DUMMY THICC and the clap from my ass cheeks keeps alerting the Plague.

On the map Haddonfield, there is a window on a fence that only works (can be vaulted) on one side only. If the park is on your left its the fence around the house the farthest on the right, on the right side of the house I believe.
---
(note: it could be the 2nd to last. Not home to double check) 
---
100% to not work. 
---
Well it’s not the worst thing, you can’t really do game breaking things but someone said you can change your rank but that might be locally (I don’t remember).
---
I didn't go to what you linked, but I did see the meme.  What a time to be alive!
---
I didnt enjoy that.
---
This sums up everyone of my games im the rank 1 killer with Green rank survivors who are all European 200+ ping even tho im from US. REVERT THE CHANGES.
---
Noed gamer.
---
It's a 1% buff at tier 3 with all survivors injured. At all other points, it's the same or worse.
---
Slam gens and and only cleanse yourself if you are worried about doing a gen in an area that has no safety options, or if your team is already spam cleansing. If the whole team only cleanses near the end of the match and cleanses across the map from her you will shit on her day as she is just an m1 killer.
---
If you guys keep giving her corrupt purge that is convenient for her to grab then you are at mercy of the map. Only certain maps have the pallet loops to prevent being red vomit murdered. If it is a bad map, you hear the noise and treat her like michael myers t3 and hide till she is back to normal
---
Thank you! It's actually my first time ever receiving it! People here are so nice 
---
That’s honestly a hot enough vid that it’s considered porn
---
There are like, 3 red rank survivors left after the update.  You literally cannot find an equally ranked team.

---
\*ruin
---
No issues with me so far. I’m on a pro if that makes any difference.
---
The times I have run NOED, if theres only 1 gen left I can wait until NOED activates to do the hit. You can tell people are running adrenaline when they don't heal around the end as well.
---
save the best for last is very, very good on clown, don't sleep on it. i run variations of:
---
ruin / bbq / enduring / spirit fury

bbq / stbfl / enduring / spirit fury

as for add ons, you really can't go wrong with the feathers, ethers, flask of bleach, and the solvent jug. redhead's is great, but avoid tattoo's.
---

---
I’m on standard PlayStation at the moment but I’m gonna try my pro in my living room to see if it makes a difference. 
---
I think ruin on Mixtape Legion is kinda toxic. Because the only thing survivors can do is genrush. Same with Ruin-Nurse. 
---
nerfing ds is understandably shit but if they nerf unbreakable i stg 
---
Thanks. I hope I was able to give a clear enough description in words of what I had in mind.
---
The one thing I think I dislike the most is that for other killers to have one hits on survivors they either need an add-on (Huntress) or a perk (NOED/Devour Hope, if I'm incorrect on Devour Hope then let me know) but all you need to do against The Plague is... Heal in a fountain.. a thing that is in your best interest if you don't want to be slower, louder, and more visible in terms of leaving blood or infecting stuff. You can't heal when you're completely infected, which is fine, but it does really bother me that without any sort of add-on, perk, or offering, she just has One-Hit-Spit. To each their own, however. I'm not here to tell anyone they're wrong. Just to explain my reasons.
---
I’d be interested to know if it does so I can stick on my pro till the next patch.

---
Honestly if you just do gens and hide all game the only person deranking is you. I don’t know why this is such a difficult concept to grasp. A quick ended game on either side is not a test of skill. You didn’t prove any of your skill by just holding Repair until the gates opened vs a less than interactive killer. Also if everyone died on first hook with little to no chases and no jukes or interaction, the killer didn’t prove any skill. They walked forward and downed someone for running in a straight line. Those aren’t demonstrations of skill, that’s just being asleep at the wheel. 
---
That kind of gameplay will give you a safety pip at best in the reds now and I’ll keep it 100, that’s miles better than what was going on in red ranks before. Wait for a lobby for 10 minutes, get tunneled and die in three minutes and the killer gets rewarded? Like huh? 
---
But sure focus on a false point about deranking. Classic diversion. 
---
What are u talkin about,this is obviously correct 
---
