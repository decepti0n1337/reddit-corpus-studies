It's not only her experiencing that, I see the same survivors on Zubat's, ScottJund's and many others streamers' games. I get that in my own games too if I get to red ranks at the start of the season. 
---

---
I'm really annoyed that people seem to say she's the only one experiencing that.
---
---
---
Nope. The way I play they rarely do 4 gens. Adrenaline rarely pops. Maybe you just don't know how to play Freddy effectively
---
messages containing only emojis. ugh
---
Evey Pek is OP. How dare u use it
---
He's had enough of the madness.

Drake &amp; Josh?! All I can think of is Drake &amp; Josh.

---
There it is again, “maybe you just don’t know how to play Freddy effectively”
---
Also, it sounds like in your case that your getting shitty survivors. I guarantee that if you got good survivors you wouldn’t win, then you’d see my point. 
---
The correct one is *insert name of literally any major company here*
---
This honestly would be amazing
---
Ok. Fair. I though he was bullied the entire match
---
His name seems to bring out people witch hunting me, not sure why. It definitely makes me feel an hostility towards him though, as this shit doesn't come from nowhere.
---
Dwight would be an amazing killer
---
To be honest that killer was probably ranked better prior to the ptb 
---
By all means do that just don't get shocked when you get mori'd
---
Such a shining beacon of the community he is. We don't deserve him.
---
Lots of grass not a lot of windows/pallets. Spirit is really good at hunting by sound and the distance isn't too bad for her on that map. Windows are her biggest problem and that map doesn't have much in the way of them for it's size. Same reason she's decent on swamp maps
---
I think that in 800 hours of Freddy I should be bound to find one good survivors. 
---
Yeah all of those other wonderful people who harrased her on twitter and kept calling her a whore (Tyde got called out for liking that tweet) and multiple other insults. 
---
Yeah I know, I saw it.
---
I'm waiting for a sick locker juke video, now with Head On.
---
I was hoping it was haunted grounds and now my day is ruined
---
Lol. Hi level thinking isnt my kinda thing.
---
Again like I said. It was a specific video I told you about. It’s just funny how  a lot of people have the same criticism.  Complaining about D Strike passionately even after you won lol 
---
But you don’t see it.  It’s just hard to see yourself that way. 
---
It is my criticism towards you. Like you have done plenty of times already... you’ll deny it. Not take criticism and learn from it or anything. Just “ NOPE YOU’RE WRONG. “  your ego is showing. 
---
And how you’ve been avoiding. I’m not doubting your skills, your passion for the game nor your grind.  Keep shaking ya dick.  Do your thing for the money. Keep on killing. Do you. But when you have 200k plus subscribers also comes a lot of Criticism. 
---
You aren’t the only one who bitches a lot. There’s tyde tyme and even Noob3 in the survivor side of things but at least they take Criticism. Specially tyde. He has it tough. 
---
Obviously you’re not ochido level but that doesn’t mean you’re immune to criticism. 
---
Also, yeah that guy really fucking loves hating you. Even tho a lot of clips are still just as valuable. 
---
Who were you referencing as a veteran of the game and community veteran?
---
I also got it with a similar build. 
---
Ruin, Whispers, PWYF and M+A with The Game offering (The Game sucks but with how Myers can’t stalk over/ through many things anymore it’s not too bad). 
---
no this can't be real Jeff would never do this this has to be some sort of sick joke 
---
Philip's the kinda guy thats cool with vegans, unless that fact is shoved in his face 24/7.
---
The perks lobster sounds like a wonderful creature. 
---
lol
---
The huntress hunts animals and people. Often describing people as meat. There is no way she would be cool with vegans.
---
So you’re the one that keeps missing the skillchecks...
---
I would take discordance personally. It’s more applicable I find, as you don’t have to break any gens to track the gens. It gives you info as soon as survivors start “rushing” gens
---
Yeah, I've got some issues that make me easily irritated. But seriously, the lag and fps and all that shit is so damn bad.
---
Yup. 
---
The Chapel building in Crotus, Haddonfield's two story houses, and (IIRC) the Disturbed Ward building in Crotus can all be pseudo-infinites if you have Balanced Landing.
---
Unless the Killer moonwalks/doubles-back there are tile variations on those maps where they will never be able to catch up (Haddonfield's is the worst because, if the Survivor is paying close attention, moonwalking/doubling can be countered).
---
Middleman here, absolutely lmao
---
What video is this from? 
---
Lol. Those controls look clunky. The guys on Friday the 13th figured out a working around to use your controller with it. 
---
I'd love to be vomit and mix it with my bloody outfit then crawl around as a slug
---
Fair enough. This is why we type F in the chat. 
---
Get the butter 
---
Toxic 10 year-olds that infest every game, causing the game to be fucking shit by them. Kind of Ochido fanboys.

Surveillance has become one of the best tracking perks. Discordance is okay but if you kick a gen and look back 10 seconds later and it's color's changed, you know the Survivor was just camping near while you left. It's absolutely amazing because it applies to all generators as opposed to only ones Survivors work on together.
---
Thank you very much! It's just like whenever I burn a Phalanx Bone, I almost never get either of MacMillan's good maps. If you're going to have variations of different Realms you should be able to control which maps you go to. 
---
A most exquisite specimen 
---
Oh yeah but what most confuses me is the immigrant part ya know? Like we’ve all seen the Jose_whatever common last name but not a younger version.
---
All perks lobster open
---
Lobster killer when?
---
That’s what I thought too, but I also doubt that in your 800 hours as freddy you haven’t lost at all. So you mean to tell me that in all your 800 hours as Freddy you’ve always gotten a 4K?
---
X to doubt. 
---
Locker hides aura so he can't see you in his world. When you are not asleep he can still grab you out of a locker and you are instantly in the dream world + injured.
---
Could do this but with my download speed 
---
Id put it on mine if the hud were gone
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death. A non-teachable perk with an Icon that looks like a Pile of Skulls. For unknown reasons one of the most controversial killer perks, particularly amongst newer players who don't remember that it was way more broken back in the day. 
---
Jake's face is perfect.
---
Meanwhile Bill's just like "it's gonna be one of those days isn't it".
---
I agree with you, and it'd bring some much needed addition to the bloodweb, it gets a bit boring seeing the exact same things over and over
---
I’d take Discordance. It’s super useful early game and I think it’s really good. 
---
He really didn’t see your red marks?
---
This makes sense to me but also playing survivor mostly takes less time when u die earlier than your teammates but killer must stay till the last survivor either dies or escapes. 
---
And this is remotely relevant... how?
---
Doctor is a living uav and is a great way to piss people off if that's what u wanna do
---
Probably the same day it releases for PC 
---
One of his videos is only a month old though. What do you feel about that one? 
---
No, I have played Freddy for 800 hours. At the beginning I did very bad, but after a few months I changed my play style as well as perks and since I have been very consistency with my Freddy. OFC I don't get 4k every match. If I wanted that I would play Nurse or Hillbilly, but I don't enjoy those characters cause once you learn them they get kinda brain dead. 
---
Idk. I like that not all of them are connected. Id rather the survivors just have unique likeness and abilities. 
---
So once it's done with the test server phase?
---
&gt; Often describing people as meat.
---
Where is that stated? She hunts people, yes, but she hunts them for sport and to take their supplies/things she wants. AFAIK it is never suggested anywhere that she eats people. 
---
Her smokehouse contains only the bodies of large, hoofed mammals; not the bodies of any human victims, and the skulls located around her home are more than likely trophies or sad mementos of her kidnapped girls rather than remnants of any kind of cannibalistic feast.
---
While Huntress definitely eats meat I don't see her disliking people who don't with any special fervor. She'd probably mentally compare it to the diet dynamics of animals in the wild, since she's more familiar with the natural world than human society. Rabbits don't eat meat, and she doesn't seem to dislike them. 
---
All that said, she'd probably still kill a vegan for their stuff, but that's because that's how she usually deals with people. If she did befriend another human, I don't think she'd dislike or hate them based on their diet.
---
Oh, no. I was saying White Knighting can be kind of gross. Just the overall mind fantasies some guys can get over female streamers. 
---
Maybe it’s thematic connections, at least for some of the pairs. Kate and the Clown were both entertainers, one for ill and one for good.  David and Huntress are both brutes with soft spots, though Huntress’ leads to starving little girls (and David’s leads to... uh... bonus BP gain...) The Plague and Jane were both women of high repute and standing who’s own shortcomings lead to their deaths. Etc etc
---
Nah, I agree. Despite the fact that I think Survivor is easier I can agree on that front. I main Killer mostly but I do feel the breath of fresh air should be just as lucrative. 
---
"Eat my booty bitch" 
---
HOOOOONNNNNNNNNNKKKKKKK
---
Aka not at work :(
---
But check out the gamevice controller. Totally worth it. 
---
Well, you are dismissing people who disagree with what you're saying as white knighting. This kinda defeats the purpose of an open discussion if you disregard what people disagreeing with you are saying on the basis of them white knighting.

---
I use a similar build a lot of the time
---
NOED, Blood Warden, Remember Me and Bitter Murmur. the trick is to not RBT someone until endgame.
---
When I'm not trying to meme I generally run Ruin, Enduring, Sloppy Butcher and BBQ/ other flex perk. I can't wait for the Thana buff because that sounds fun on the oink.
---
I usually just skin them alive and make book bindings or lamps out from them.. spines and skulls look interesting as a table lamp.
---
Nice
---
I don’t farm, or care about blood points, ranks are a joke at the moment.
---
Cute/10
---
Its a stop sign for a reason..
---
I'd check it out but i don't mobile game Much. 
---
Oh yeah Let me send you a whole library of videos lmao  you have a channel with all the videos. But I guess it’s hard to see yourself that way. 
---
Yeah man. you checkmated me real good 😂  
---
I guess all the Memes and all these different people just have a false narrative and a false sense of reality. 
---
Never said I wasn’t wrong because I very well could be. You may have gotten better and good on you.  Sadly, it seems Criticism is an attack on you. 
---
It doesn’t matter if you don’t bring the extra unfun addons, legion itself isn’t fun to play against. 
---
I'm glad I was an inspiration for you :D
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: In-game
---
Description: Sometimes I'm unable to attack and takes me multiple clicks to trigger an attack. As a survivor, I have my struggle key as M1 and sometimes I'll stop struggling and die. I just got a new mouse as well, so I know it's not a hardware issue.
---
But I enjoy playing him, so who cares? I bought the game with my money, I bought legion with my money, so why shouldn’t I be allowed to enjoy him?
---
But he can see your aura doing the "get into locker" animation, so if he's paying attention you're screwed right?
---
I just made mention that before she initially came under fire from this a month or so back she would always start streams in the green ranks despite being in the red ranks previously.  You do not derank that hard unless you are making a conscious effort and the way she described doing it would be extremely time consuming.  I don't tune into every single stream ever, but she seems very consistent and plays for hours on end.  It doesn't seem realistic that you'd do it that way.  I don't for a second believe it.  
---
As for proving legitimacy, she herself openly admits to DCing on stream and there is video proof of it happening.  When you're openly broadcasting it *and* arrogantly talking as though you're free from consequence then that won't sit well with people.  There needs to be some sort of reprisal for this from BHVR because this is really making them look bad.  
---
ScottJund, KittyChipz, Boxghostsz, AngryPug, Geistra should be punished too.  Nobody is saying "only JenDenise and nobody else", but she has had a history of doing this constantly and there is nothing being done about it.  Funnily enough, I think everyone you listed except Pug are friends of hers.  I guess DCers sharpen DCers.  
---
And I'll say again, if there is little difference between R10 and R1 then why derank to begin with?  Just play like a normal person.
---
Pigs fun. People want to be toxic so they get 4 traps. 
---
Ruin, Surveillance, BBQ, MYC/Nurses
---
Combat straps, Gears/sketch
---
BBQ and Surveillance make it really easier to keep track of the survivors.
---
One of the most important things while running the killer is to not throw down every consecutive pallet. That creates dead-zones in maps when someone else has to run the killer. If you teabag a bunch, chances are, you're not going to make it as far, and might have to throw down the very next pallet. It might not affect the teabagger, but it will probably affect whoever has to run the killer next.
---
You can liveyour dreams of being an edgy teenager and stab the fuck outta people
---
I love yeeting over pallets 
---
GODD HOWARD\*
---
“Don’t let this distract you from the fact that pig her addons suck 
---
&gt;As for proving legitimacy, she herself openly admits to DCing on stream and there is video proof of it happening. 
---
Did you even read what I wrote? 
---
&gt;The rules are that you are not supposed to DC more than a certain % of your total games overall. That % is not known to the public and only devs know it. If she went over that % she would get punished. But she hasn't exceeded it as she plays a ton of games and DCs only a tiny % of them. So she's not breaking the rules. Unless you know what % it is and can prove that overall (along her off-stream games) she DCs more than she plays then go ahead. Show the source from which you are getting the numbers and prove their legitimacy.
---
No shit she deranks, neither she nor I ever said she doesn't. You are ignoring what I've wrote and answering made up question. I didn't ask you to prove that she deranks. I'm asking you to prove that she exceeded the % number of DCs that is allowed.
---
I have clearly provided the reasons why streamers derank (and not only streamers, players overall). Killers do it for shorter queues and more variety, survivors do it for more variety. Devs don't have a problem with DCing unless it's below certain % and you face equally bad players at red ranks as you do at rank 10. The only difference is that you have a bigger pool of players.
---
The reason people derank is because at the start of the season people who play the game more rank up faster. It doesn't matter if they are good or bad, if you play the game a lot you will rank up as the ranking system doesn't represent your skill at all. That means for the first 2 weeks of the rank season you are stuck against the same people every game. Every game you know what the other player is playing, how they play, what they are using. It gets mind-numbingly boring as it completely lacks variety. You don't need to be a streamer to experience it, just get to red ranks early. You'll notice as the rank seasons start nearing its end streamers stop deranking as more people catch up and you get more variety and shorter Q times. Jen has stated multiple times on twitter that she deranks because of lack of variety at red ranks early in the season.
---
You don't have to be a streamer to do it, tons of players do it as it's not fun at all to play against the exact same people every game or two. There were streams in which she literally went against the same 2 killers for hours.
---
Normally I agree about camping being both really boring and unfair for that person, but when the exit gates are open, I think it's very reasonable to do so. What else does that killer have to do besides secure one kill? Should they just leave so you get a free unhook?
---
Interesting data 
---
&gt; Doc can find every single survivor with such ease.
---
Once... then he has to zap them or they have to be in your terror radius for half a minute. 
---
&gt; You are actually stupid if you think Freddy is better. He can only see he auras of survivors outside his TR and in the Dream world.
---
With how easy it is to snag survivors and how small his terror radius is, I dont think I'm the stupid one lol
---
Not a nerf, just a change. It's no longer going to be the most hated perk, just one that will help you with tunnelers.
---
I've refused to use it my entire dbd career because I think it's B.S., but I'll use it after the change. 
---
Touché
---
How about Ormond and Legion?
---
Nea's smile actually looks pretty natural if I'm being honest.
---
Doc in unequivocally the best tracker in the game. Once you see who screams you run over and chase them. Once is enough to start a chase. He doesn’t need tracking perks like BBQ, Nurse’s calling, or whispers because he’s the best tracker. 
---
Here’s the most useful thing I can add to this discussion, mind your own business and let people play how they want,  and if you don’t like it don’t watch them, literally watch anyone else if all you’re gonna do is bitch and complain about how they play the game. 
---
I think you can also play it with steam link mobile (if you own the game on Steam, obviously) 
---
Ok
---
Why do you keep reposting?
---
Are you that desperate for views and likes? 
---
He gotta S L O R P 
---
Yeah, you aren't there to entertain them, but if you just come in with full slaughter mode, how much fun are you going to have compared to if you took it easy and fucked with them a bit before killing them? I'm not saying don't kill survivors if someone DCs, I'm saying to don't be a cunt about it and just toy with them a bit.
---
S L O R P 
---
Honestly if people DC I'm not even mad at Legion anymore and feel bad that their and my game were ruined. Stop DCing you fucks
---
That's ok, when the patch is released, you can just tunnel the Meg wearing the neon jacket, have her DS you, boom, new obsession!
---
&gt; Once you see who screams you run over and chase them. Once is enough to start a chase.
---
What about the next chase, then the next, then the next. Freddy gets to know exactly where everyone is who is asleep at all times, whereas doc needs to zap them multiple times AND they only scream, not reveal their auras. Plus, its so much eaisier to snap out of it than to get out of the dream world. 
---
Aight whats your usual build, addonswise
---
It is indeed, ultra rare if I'm not mistaken 
---
You can't see scratch marks on Ormond - Legion can't see scratch marks. 200iq design.
---
Nope. One's purple and just very rare, the other is pink and ultra-rare.
---
I so hate the swamp
---
I like the green legion pin and the increased movement. But when I can I use increased duration. I like being super fast and yeeting over pallets. 
---
The penalty to the emblem does not apply if a survivor is within 16 meters of the hooked one. 
---
What’s the difference between them?
---
I stack blocks
---
Report the message. He’s guaranteed a PSN warning/ban.
---
You care more about her dcing than the actual devs do so I suggest you stop wasting your time and mind your business.
---
*tasted like pumpkin pie*
---
I actually did that because the price it's based off of doesn't even have feet, but that's a really cool way if looking at it! I decided that I wanna keep working on it with my imagination, so I'm going to add feet and a background, I've pretty much never free drawn on anything close to this good so wish me luck lol, you sound like you know what your doing so I ask your blessing
---
Clown gang rise up
---
The basic M1 killer setup with Enduring and Spirit Fury, with BBQ on top. The last perk changes depending on my mood, but most often it's Ruin or Whispers. I usually just use random brown/yellow addons, as I'm currently stocking up on the high tier ones.
---
Now, if I feel like being spicy, I'll change things up. Huntress' Lullaby, Unnerving Presence, Agitation, BBQ. With Interlocking Razor and Razor Wire as addons. It sucks if they find your Lullaby totem early, but it can snowball out of control pretty quickly.
---
d a r n 
---
*Gets the soy sauce* Got to have sodium. 
---
This guy gets it
---
If you have a problem with hook camping I suggest running DS and Deliverance and saving them for endgame.
---
White knighting is using logic now. You people are hilarious. The devs don’t give a shit that she dcs, meanwhile you people literally froth at the mouth everytime she does it. Have fun wasting time over shit that doesn’t concern you. 
---
Just fyi, the tombstone is often comboed with another addon that gives infinite tier 3, but also makes reaching tier 3 much longer. To counter, simply try to not give him stalk time by hiding and running away. 
---
I have a problem with someone being a jerk, doesn’t matter if it’s survivor or killer
---
"Look at me with my 200 iq and also im aways right even tho im an asshole, also i'll use emojis to prove how serious and how right i am"
---
Shouldve said "Hagtually" 
---
Ok well that isnt optimal. Blocks are heavily overrated. Try using range addons and dress, run the green range addon and the yellow dress. Apart from class photo those are his best addons
---
The purple one ends his tier 3 immediately after and the pink only goes down about halfway. 
---
This is really cool, I've been thinking about getting the self care icon tattooed somewhere on my body too. You always need to remember to take care of yourself &lt;3
---
One had about 600
---
I have used every single addon. I prefer stacking blocks since it shortens the time and I can usually get a grab since the survivors think “I have 7 seconds I can finish this” and I get a free grab. Other than that, pill bottle is my favorite. I don’t like class photo since the tracking isn’t for me and I like shorter dream transition. 
---
There are few pallets (lowest number in the game, they are actually increasing it next patch so there will be 8 of them minimum) and they are very far away from each other.
---
I don't think I've lost once as killer on that map, after the first 2 chases all the survivors can do is run in a straight line and or try to hide as there are no pallets left.
---
That person was saying that you shouldn’t care how other people choose to play a game to the point where it becomes obsessive, case in point here with the amount of toddlers crying about a streamer dcing and making note of it everytime. 
---
I’m defending her because I feel that her treatment is unfair and in the end boils down to people disliking her and wanting any reason to jump down her throat.
---
\[Roundabout Plays\]
---
The pink one has no affect on your evil within bar
---
So you could theoretic mori all four survivors is you can catch them.
---
It can also be combined with tuft of hair to give you infinite mori capabilities as tier 3 won't run out.
---
^^faint ^^halloween ^^jingle
---
Or hear his loud ass footsteps? Or heavy panting?
---
It'll accumulate more infection as they do more actions
---
Woah now that you mention it the right hand does look a lot like the DS icon coming in to slice the arm open
---
You have my blessing my child. Go forth and draw.
---
PS: Have you got a drawing mannequin? I  find that it can be really helpful for positioning!
---
Same. Guys don’t even wanna play the game. Just r1 and crouch away. 
---
I'm pretty sure the streamer should also have "teabags at pallets and disconnects on first down"
---
Because people need to use it to justify their gameplay. They're bad players. Easy.
---
"I never actually said anything mildly offensive" lol anyway last I'm saying but everything and even more is what I expected in this little reddit chat. I still think your a narcissist. Cheers!
---
Not everyone can can reach any rank though. Only a tiny, tiny% of players even reach Rank 1. I remember a while back when Behavior released some data that showed how few people reach higher ranks.  It was something like only 20% of players ever even reach Rank 10 (going off memory so could be off a decent bit but it was a pretty extreme)
---
Speedhack disguised as bad ping
---
Then you are playing Freddy unoptimally. Dont call him bad then if you arent playing him to his potential
---
Dude, you're acting super edgy about a video game where you can't do that, and as your fellow killer I'm reminding you we're all here to have fun and not to make life Hell for people whose team has fucked them over.
---
The trapper! I think I could achieve that actually
---
No, this person said we shouldn't care how other people play, even if they are a big part of DbD's community.
---
Like I said, if it's okay for her, it should be okay for Ochido since we "shouldn't care how other people choose to play a game"
---
If not then you're a hypocrite.
---
Yeah, people dislike her for her behaviour and her playstyle. Just like people disliked Ochido for his behaviour and playstyle. 
---
Even if I use the best addons, he’s still the worst killer. I recommend you watch Bricky’s casefile on Freddy before starting another argument like this. 
---
He probably left his VHS porno up there &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt; Well, I don't own any DLC, so I haven't played any of the non-base maps firsthand
---
&gt;I do remember playing like, three games in a row on Mt. Ormond the other night
---
uh, pick one? :')
---
Try to play some matches without your friend because there is a big difference between solo survivor and swf, the best thing to do is to first learn how to survive by yourself and then learn to survive together, you can't help others if you can't help yourself you see
---
Also as a first survivors, you did a good choice choosing Meg, she has one of the best perk in the  game, Adrenaline, it will save you in most of your game. Claudette and Feng are also good choices for beginners because their perks are easy to learn and to use, when you'll get better to the game (and I'm sure you will) Bill is a good choice if you're playing on PC, his perks are mostly "high risk, high rewards" but they'll too help you and your teammates, especially Borrowed Time.
---
As killer play a easy one to start, Trapper,Wraith and Hillbilly are the best choice to learn the basics of killers (+ they got good perks). When you'll start to do some Merciless Victories, you should try all the killers, to see the one that correspond the most to you.
---
Also ignore the toxicity of some players, all they want is attention, don't become like them, don't start insulting players because they're bad or trolling you, just be nice in general and people will be thanksful.
---
sory if bed english me french and tired
---
Give me a nurse with blink and a leatherfaces saw. Add on? Tombstone and 5 blinks. 
---
FOR THE LAST TIME ITS CHERRY KOOLAID!
---
With this said I do believe survivors should get more points for cooperative actions like healing each other especially in solo queues as it rewards positive teamwork
---
Currently most of them don't as the queue times have been suprisingly positive for the killers lately. But there was a long period of time around a month ago or so when Scott and a bunch of less known streamers I've seen were deranking around rank 5-6 because of awful queue times.
---
The pink one also keeps his speed at around tier 1
---
Yes you can, what about bodyblocking? You can abuse it by holding some one hostage in the game.  The Dev dismissed some one voicing concerns(Like many people are doing to OP) about killers being a lot harder to play and it just wasn't fun. (Back then it was a LOT harder to play killer) and he just dismissed it and told him to play another game.
---
Deranking is scummy. You're going to rank you're not supossed to be that can possibly ruin some one else's game due to them not having the same amount of experience.
---
You have to look at the bigger picture my friend.
---
I'm no angel, I think every one here has Rage Quit or quit due to other reasons, but I don't do it constantly to derank to get easier games. There is no excuse to derank. And her excuse was just so weak.
---
Yeah, streamers are held at a higher standard, as some one with influence you should spread positivity and set an example, not actively do something heavily looked down at and give excuses for it, trying to justify it.
---
That's a funny way of spelling David.
---
Ooft another one ;p I'm honored 
---
Well damn that is an unusual combination. 
---
But one of the best experiences in the game is equipping the best addons, getting the red mori, and raining on the parade of a SWF team that thinks flashlight blinding a killer before they’re even allowed to react means they have skill
---
Just go up to them and press attack. Don’t lunge.
---
You like the block ones the most, so you are playing freddy wrong. Period.
---
I just thought of what would scare me. 
---
I mean it’s hard being a legion because they are a dogshit killer 
---
?
---
Who?
---
Cmon man. This is BHVR were talking about. So probably not anytime soon®
---
If you get bullied, your just bad.
---
Why do her legs look so small
---
Perfect length.
---
In the hood crack heads state through the windows like raptors from Jurassic park. 
---
Does coughing cause any effect, like a noise notification  
---
Yea, but when referring to Legion as a whole, a lot of people use it. Besides, not everyone plays Joey.
---
Oh I just find it a bit tedious to constantly say “They” or “It” (please don’t take this out of context) 
---
I just refer to legion as either Legion or Him because that’s how I am. 
---
Huntress can sit on my face, so yeah you're pretty much right.
---
Kind of hard for me to play killer in the PTB, I tried waiting 30 mins and still had no one in my lobby. Plus there already numerous posts about how hard it is for killers to rank up with the new system. We don't need to beat that dead horse. 
---
You were just in my post justifying depipping as survivor for "more fun".
---
I don't think you get to grief this guy for playing anything for fun. 
---
Don't fret, she can bully. But when it goes off, Leatherdaddy will fucking destroy! Don't take any shit LF mains!
---
No, you can hear them better as they cough but low level infections don't do anything at all. The only effect infection has on a Survivor is when it goes to 100% and they get broken plus vomit. No pings for the Killer, no traceable trails, nothing really till it gets to 100% and applies broken. They also can NOT infect other players/objects till it reaches 100%.
---
There isn't a reason to half way make someone sick unless you are wanting them to use a fountain in order to have Corrupt Purge yourself for later or as a slight time stall while you do something else.
---
Woah woah woah. I think you need to calm down a little bit.
---
Because if you dominate THAT hard, it was likely because the survivors were trash and you weren't against people of appropriate skill level. This stops people from easy-pipping and will hopefully make rank matter just a LITTLE more 
---
Come on man don't tip your hat that you're trolling. 
---
New defibrillators are really hardcore 
---
Oh, my, gods, that took me way too long. Although in my defense I always thought she ate the heart (so most of the time was spent looking that up). Good pun!
---
Ugh! I wish I'd done a caption contest!
---
I not Jake. But I relate. I sent a killer a msg today saying sorry, and he shouldnt give up, that matchmaking is shit. Me and my friends are rank 7-11 and he was rank 20 trapper :c we didn't bully him but the random 4th guy was being toxic
---
i always gg if its not a camper or tunneller.
---
I’ve been following this artist for some time (I posted a parody piece they did here before) and I have to say I love how passionate they are about this ship. They even have some really interesting views on the toxicity of these two being together but also,,, the art is adorable
---
No
---
Oh hey that's my friend and I omg I'm the Dwight!!
---
It's not really dumb, you are getting punished for not using your power as you choose not to pick up your 115% movement speed ranged attack.
---
Plus being forced to play broken against her while she's using the newly buffed thanatophobia is pretty unfair for the survivors as they don't get a choice in anything. It's like playing against a tuft of hair/perma tier 3 Myers but without the requirement of stalking people for half of the game.
---
Hag eats the alien parasite before it can eat you, she’s really misunderstood but in my fanfiction, she’s the hero of our tale, survivors wake up a little later and are like wow I feel great time to leave, i was completely wrong, and want to rethink all of my prejudices regarding mummies
---
We were fucking blessed with papa Jeff, you take that back.
---
Hag eats whatever’s in those searchable gore sacks you find wherever there are wasteland raider scum
---
1. I believe it’s maybe 15-20 seconds somewhere around there 
---
2. You make someone broken with one fully charged vile pure. I think it’s fine the way it is 
---
3. I hope they don’t increase the range, it’s already easy enough to hit people as is and it can be made to do damage. Looking up is a pretty tactic as well to make it go over rocks/walls
---
4. I haven’t really payed much attention to that so I can’t comment on that one

It’s this reason when I’m not playing seriously I don’t hook people, which sucks. I’ve seen far to many survivors get the shaft from their own team which is beyond terrible because of how many killers try and secure a kill at all costs, making them being low level and learning the game very discouraging. I hate to always come back to this reason, but the sad truth is there is a lot of... juvenile players on here. And nothing against the younger players, but it usually means their more likely to try and be toxic in order to “have fun”. It’s not even questionable for me at this point, I’ll play 10hours and like clockwork as soon as schools let out, the servers go from having common sense to a cesspool of attempted toxicity. I just wish more people, the younger included, but took more pride in becoming better and honing their skills, instead of trying to feel good like a sociopath being malicious to others. A man can dream I guess.
---
Meg main massive brain
---
I mean even if they stop playing dbd, it represents something important: literal self-care.
---
Exactly 
---
They post content here every now and then don’t they?
---
Uhh you say a 50 game spreadsheet but yet there’s 55? I’m confused. 
---
Oh I thought this was supposed to be a joke. What a terrible opinion
---
Let's be honest: it's both 
---
so the survivors had a small numbers tweak.  killers had a big overhaul on all emblems. the thing that sucks the most is i feel like im gonna be playing against survivors not up to par with me because its really hard to pip. If anything i think survivors should worry too, because i think it will kill rank 1 queue time.
---
But this makes your spreadsheet incorrect. You’re actually skewing your numbers by not counting the games that you got farmed and dc’d. That would be a baseball batter not counted his strikes from randy Johnson because the ball is too wet or his tummy is hurting. He says that bats 337 but really he’s batting 280 or something. 
---
Ok, a 115% movement speed killer with instadowns, that takes 2 add ons to be efficient at all?
---
So there's Myers who gets that intermittantly though the match anyway, fragrant tuft that only takes one add on.
---
Huntress with Iri heads that is permanent and takes no set up, and is ranged, where it wouldn's be on Plague as you're not using the corruption.
---
Cannibal, who can do that PLUS multiple one shots at once.
---
And Hillbilly, that people like to pretend is balanced is essentially that with no setup WITH insane map control.
---
Will do, gonna make a few more, so it's long enough for a decent video :) 
---
I don’t like legion because he has no counterplay, I like him because he’s fun. If I wanted to play a killer who doesn’t have counterplay, I’d play Nurse, but she’s boring. I wouldn’t mind it if he got reworked so long as he’s still fun. I really don’t like it when people put words in my mouth and misunderstand what I’m saying. I just want to have fun with the game, and legion is really fun 
---
Plague no question 
---
Who am I to claim my opinion? Dunno. Who are you to claim that she shouldn't be banned for blatantly being toxic?
---
&gt;DC-ing in that form isn't a problem as you are not negatively impacting the games you do it in
---
How about the new players her SWF group is playing against? You sure smurfing doesn't affect them?
---
First Dwight has to Prove Thyself to Jane.
---
He's fucking with you
---
I also follow a drawing sub, I saw this and thought... This would be perfect for the deadbydaylight sub! Then I realized... 
---
Who said I was comparing
---
I don't think he even tries to resist. ;)
---
In math result column it would be nice to see difference  in color shade or boldness for escaped vs death so it’s easier to visualize the difference. 
---
The devs are aware of the game loading issues and you won't get banned for that, they've stated this specifically. If a player disconnects during game play that puts you and your team mates at a clear disadvantage, that's reportable. If a player disconnects just before their death hook prompt it's not bannable. 
---
I once had a match where a player that spawned near me immediately ran to a pallet and slammed it down to make a noise prompt, hopped over the pallet twice to noise spam, and then disconnected right after causing me to be found by the killer at the start of the match. That's reportable. That was a weird match haha 
---
Platform: Xbox (maybe all consoles) 
---
Description: Some survivors are getting on top of the rocks that are on the mounds in maps. When done Killers are unable to reach survivors unless playing as the Huntress. 
---
Reproduction: To get up on top of the rocks you just need to basically surf climb while moving forwards till you move a little up the rock to then slightly move either left or right while holding forward till you are walking on top of the rock. 
---
Expected results: What should happen would be that they are not able to climb and just drop off the side of the mounds. 
---
Reproduction rate: When I follow the steps I normally am able to do the glitch once ever few games granted that it is a map with mounds.

This is a very important point but is it better to then take a hit and avoid a pallet so that you can get a speed boost to get to the other pallet?

Thanks and love your name!
---
Well, it's disappointing that I put hours into this work and get downvoted, but what can you do. \*shrug\*
---
And this is a video game, not baseball. I don't feel your analogy works because the only data I wanted to compile were games without ill intent that went against the concept of the game.
---
For example, including all 1v3s does not generate accurate numbers for 1v4s, which is the data I was trying to compile. Now, you might say, "just include those anyway. Whoever wants to assess the data can just pick out the 1v4s if they want to use it," but the numbers are already skewed in the 1v3s because I don't really play to win in those games due to the incredibly low statistical likelihood of actually winning/surviving them. 
---
And if you want to use that data, it *is* there. It's in the spreadsheet, just not added to the total because it wasn't a regular farm game--it was a unique game where the Killer/Survivor were *actively working together to farm me* (this wasn't just Claudette pulling me off and running away). 
---
Providing a template *and* the inspiration? Best kind of OP
---
If a Nurse is getting run around, then it's not a good Nurse. Simple.
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Appreciate your suggestions! 
---
Will be changing that for future spreadsheets.
---
If you want to rank up (note: PTB changes to rankup *might* go into effect and make rankups a lot harder) what you'll want to do is get at least 1 gen done, get 1 or 2 saves, and get chased for a decent amount, with some line of sight breaking getting you some points too, even if you get found immediately after. If you want some tips on movement I'd suggest watching some good youtubers and copying their movement till it becomes 2nd nature, it's how I managed to get to rank 1 as both killer and survivor, and youll start to see whats safe and what isnt yourself naturally.
---
Shouldn't it be "let me out"?
---
Basement is guaranteed save
---
I like the new changes. The PTB is just bugged rn, and it messes up how many pips you actually get. It should be fine after it comes out. 
---
Well tbh i'm not good at the game at all, but is easy to get in rank 5-1. Especially as a survivor in my experience. So maybe a good change?
---
No? It's BHVR's fault for creating those killers. And it's silly to think people only play Nurse for "revenge". They play Nurse because they don't wanna deal with the chase mechanics.
---
SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS
---
Your just being rude for no reason 
---
I have nothing against nurse. 
---
Too funny!
---
leaked Switch footage
---
Rank 1 doesn't equal good. But actual good nurses end games incredibly early on. I don't think I've ever survived when it was someone like Zubat, Swift or even some of the nurse players who aren't streamers that I know are really good.
---
I wonder if that counts everyone who purchased the game. Doubtlessly, there were and are people who own Dead by Daylight but don't actively play it and they could massively skew such results.
---
In any case what I'm trying to say is that it used to be more of a time commitment to reach Rank 1 than any testament of skill. Anyone who plays this game consistently and has encountered facecampers at Rank 3 or immersed Claudettes at Rank 1 can tell you that Rank didn't really mean anything.
---
It still won't mean anything if nobody can pip up, but the current system doesn't exactly serve much purpose either.
---
Hi I'm 10 why does that dog have extra small leg
---
I set it to R3 so I can do it while looking around and never accidentally throw pallets when healing (or vise versa) I also set my skill check button to X so I can play one-handed while working on gens and I set the invert camera to left on the directional pad so I don't accidentally pressed it in game. (It's the black pad by default, a very large button that is too easy to press on accident)
---
Serves 'em right. 
---
Fair 
---
Pig
---
Nice to know.
---
I still feel pretty bad for all those folks who queued up only to have my game crash before the match even starts.  Heh.
---
The Pig. Putting traps on people and watch them shit their pants as they try to get it off in time. LOL. (insert evil laugh) 
---
Honestly I don't see why everyone hates the Legion so much, personally I enjoy facing them as well as playing them, I hate Mike as much as everyone else hates the Legion though.

---
The Nea (rank 3) prevented him from getting any kills, I didn’t know the hardships he endured and took a hit at the gate for Feng, effectively letting Nea TBag him at the hatch
---
I normally just try to steamroll and get survivors on hooks at a pace that matches them taking previous ones off
---
And if I confirm the location of like ~2 injured survivors and a healthy one, it gets turned into a slugfest that instantly ends game if I catch the last survivor coming back to pick a lad up
---
I feel like any time I focus on a survivor a gen or two pops off. also 3 hooks per person gets more points overall for everyone so to me it feels more "optimal" over sweating a 4k
---
Yessir. 
---
I am a firm believer in giving credit where it is due. If it is just a popular meme format that everybody uses, I may not link that, but since I was inspired by someone's creative and original piece, I believe they are due some of the credit of what I made.

Thank you now prepare for people hating you cause you stated your opinion

Nice of you to ignore most of my post. Really adds to the conversation.
---
&gt;Who am I to claim my opinion
---
No, it's the devs that make the rules for DC-ing and its their say whether or not it's fine to DC if you don't go below certain %. You said that DC-ing doesn't belong in this game at all, while the devs don't think that. You can claim whatever you want.
---
She is allowed to say whatever she wants on her stream. 90% of the time it's played as jokes as she's an entertainer and her stream. She doesn't say anything in the post game chat that is in that type, she doesn't harrass people on steam or on social media, she doesn't send her viewers after people. She has strict moderating against people using racial slurs or diseases such as cancer or aids in sentences. If you think she's toxic for calling someone dumb after they make a dumb decision or say something dumb then you must really dislike internet in general. 
---
&gt;How about the new players 
---
Rank doesn't matter in this game. You can be a new player and get to the red ranks fast and easy if you play a lot. I got to rank 1 as killer in the first 2 weeks as I tunneled and facecamped people. I was shit at the game and I got to rank 1.
---
You get the exact same number of bad players at rank 10 as you get at rank 1. You get the exact same number of potato teammates and good teammates at lower ranks and at rank 1.
---
Jen and her friends never go to 20-15 where the actual new players that just got the game are.
---
Killers do it for shorter queues and more variety, survivors do it for more variety. Devs don't have a problem with DCing unless it's below certain % and you face equally bad players at red ranks as you do at rank 10. The only difference is that you have a bigger pool of players.
---
You don't have to be a streamer to do it, tons of players do it as it's not fun at all to play against the exact same people every game or two. There were streams in which she literally went against the same 2 killers for hours. I know that happens, I've seen it on multiple streams and had it happen to me too. In the first weekend of this ranked season I've played against the same 3 groups of survivors over and over again. I tried to switch killers to at least give them some variety but we were all pretty bored by the end of it as we knew what to expect from each other.
---
Both of the cannibals and the finger-muncher (and Michael) hate vegans. We must be too stringy. 🤔
---
IT'S THE GAME SPHERE!
---
SPHERICAL!
---
I try to play like that too but most survivors will just yeet someone off a hook and it's really not hard to just come over and instadown them rather than committing to a full chase with someone else. Add to this a dumb team that just spends all their time unhooking with noone doing gens and it's an easy 3k at least. Killers would stop doing this annoying shit if survivors would just do gens but they both wont stop.
---
Huntress breaking pallets???
---
Oh, I was just making options for the poll. Surprised I got through them that quickly... Thanks for checking tho!
---
Yeah that happened to me today. I tunneled him. I usually don’t do that but if you’re going to be that guy, I have no problem returning the favor. 
---
BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Whispers
---
Any other build doesn’t compare
---
Another installment in our Killer vs Killer videos! This time with The Spirit and The Legion! Hope you guys enjoy. We put extra work into the intro for this one.
---
Note: These videos are not monetized and just for a fun hobby. They aren't a "true" competition against each other. Just for fun nonsense entertainment. We also are stupid and did this weird voice effect/RPG element for some reason on this one.
---
As far as I know that Ochido dude is the only console player who got banned for anything other than the P3 exploit
---
non
---
I mean, they seem dumb to you, but in most high rank games good killers don't hang around hooks so to them it's reasonable
---
Oui
---
I thought I was looking at Identity V for a second.
---
Right? I think the most balanced was the Victory Cube ranking, although I think the game should be leveled to where you should average 2k a game for the stats.
---
Agreed. I like to imagine that the killer and their chapter's survivor came out of the same "movie" and that there was a story there that we didn't see, like with the licensed characters.
---
Maybe something like the cave where the Plague was buried got unearthed, and Jane was one of the many people trying to get the scoop on it (yeah, archaeology finds aren't really talk show material, but let's go with it), and all the disturbance somehow reawakened the Plague? Maybe Jane is a descendant of hers or someone she knew in life (I don't think Jane's ethnicity was stated, but the Plague's so old there's plenty of time for her descendants to go wherever to make it work), and somehow her blood or w/e woke the Plague up. Jane's film crew get picked off one by one, leaving Jane the final girl to face the Plague before they both got snapped up by the Entity.
---
That's just off the top of my head so it'd need more work, but it sounds enough like a horror movie plot to work. I just really dig the idea of fleshing out all the killers (and survivors too, by proxy) with their own horror movie backgrounds so they can stack up to established licensed killers and feel like they really committed enough murder to catch the Entity's attention. The slasher villains who impressed the Entity and the survivors worthy enough of going up against them.
---
It wouldn't impact the game much, but it'd add a lot of fun to the characters' stories if each of them was the summary of a mini-slasher flick.
---
Yo I thought it was a meme like “Bitch”
---
Probably didn’t read the PWYF fix for Plague.  Devour on Plague works decently well, but Dark Devotion is trash lol
---
I should match you then. You would let me survive right? 😂
---
Don’t worry, it is. The other one was edited to say “let me out” instead too.

when you extend a chase by 4 seconds
---
This is dope, good job!
---
Hello, fellow vegan. Do you play on PC or PS4?
---
Yeah, the fact that it can get grabs which are essentially one hit downs without chases, with absolutely 0 counterplay without using a mediocre perk every game *in case* she shows up with one is bullshit.
---
She can so easily phase from out of sight using perks like discordance or surveillance, or the BS 5 totem build.
---
It really needs to have a downside, like lowered phase duration to limit how far she can get with complete stealth.

I don't think auto adjust does anything. I'd suggest low settings, 0% reso and maybe run in windowed mode might speed it up a little. I recently upgraded my pc, I went from 80 fps on medium settings to 144 on ultra. It's very satisfying. 
---
the game really is good for pig though, the layout is complex enough so getting billy boxes take longer, but at the same time the map being so small is good for crouching

---
Most killers aren't Zubat.
---
No, she's really good even without add ons, I'd say she's better than Myers. If you are any decent and land your stream then you can down then pretty fast. If you are bad on her then yeah she's not really good as it will take a long time for them to get broken, the timer is 50 seconds if you don't land your puke. She's not add on reliant at all.
---
The fact that it takes add ons doesn't change the fact that it's not fair to play against, omegablink nurse takes add ons too, does it make it fair? Insaheal is an ultra rare add on, does it make it fair?
---
&gt;So there's Myers who gets that intermittantly though the match anyway, fragrant tuft that only takes one add on.
---
Yes, we are comparing something that takes like 1-2 gens vs a character with his ultra rare add on that takes half of the game or more to set up if you are playing well and not playing vs potatoes. That's totally the same.
---
You are talking about it not being broken by comparing stuff to iridescent head, a broken and unfair add on. I don't think you're going in the right direction. 
---
&gt;Cannibal
---
Yeah great argument, he can instadown multiple people at once! Wow that's so strong, it will totally happen often because survivors with a brain will clump together for you. You're also comparing a chainsaw that takes fair amount of time to charge and can be countered by windows and pallets to a killer using an auto attack (again, we are talking about a situation where everyone is broken and can't clense themselves).
---
Billy is balanced minus the instasaw, you can loop him so that he doesn't get to use his chainsaw on you if you are any good at survivor. Yes, Billy's map control makes him a really strong killer, one of the top tier killers. If you think base hillbilly is not balanced then you are just not really good at the game yet. If you get better at looping then you'll realise he's fair. You can make him unable to use his chainsaw on you as it takes time to charge, you can just swing at them normally as Plague in that setup.
---
The clense on the fountains is fine, it's fair for both sides.
---
I know how much people hate legion so I try to make my matches as fun as possible. I don’t use Frank’s mixtape or Mori’s because I want everyone to have fun. 
---
If I wanted to play someone because I didn’t want survivors having fun I’d play Nurse, and she’s boring asf to play. 
---
No that's Anthem
---
I ended up getting a 4k at 3 gens. But I played super fair. They were mostly running around clicking at me  
---
I reported but I doubt anything will come from it 
---
*Usually* being the key word. 
---
Some of the rude fuckers are actually really goddamned good and it is especially annoying. 
---
Thats an A pose you noob.
---
Makes your pp smaller.
---
Bruh, I'm like rank 10 max (hovering 11-12) and I keep getting swf with rank 2 to 8. I get roflstomped. It's disheartening. 
---
Then right after I stomp rank 11s and feel a little bit better. 
---
Meh
---
And what about that oddly placed TV? That's either dangerously close and will damage the patient's eyes or it is uselessly facing the wrong direction. 
---
Thanks. The message genuinely threw me off after having countless fun games where we just give each other ggs and compliments on good plays. I mostly have positive interactions post games but this one just threw me waaay off.
---
They should remove swamp
---
RISE *cough* UUUUUUP!
---
For the one person you get with it, yea. But normally it’ll take so long to get t3 everyone else will be gome
---
This is so wrong...
---
There is no wrong or right man 
---
I never said otherwise my dude. I meant zubat as in above average skill level nurses, pleeeeenty of them out there. You can manage to maybe survive a bit if theres structures you can juke on but imagine for instances blood lodge or auto heaven , if nurse sees you in the middle of the map, you are pretty much done as things you would normally do are useless, looping vaulting etc etc. Thats why its a gamebreaking killer, kills the fundamentals of chasing with pretty much no counter
---
The witch is dead
---
The way it moves through her face so majestically 
---
Then we need to look at the points scored per minute. 
---
True
---
At that point people just unhook each other regardless of killer location though
---
Points + hoping the killer chases you instead, or dead harding through the killer to get to an obstacle if you're the one being farmed
---
A meaty decisive strike can result in either in Dwight being sent into the dying state by Jane Herself or a hot trial in a locker with her.
---
Right? And the dude was like, just stop ducking at the game. Ugh. People like that make me hate this community, but then people who offer to farm are the reason I love this community.
---
Just wait for the 50 self unhooks achievement. 
---
That was exhausting. 
---
Wraith, invisibility and a sweet bell.
---
Honestly it shouldn't upset me as much as it does, but when someone teabags after vaulting/dropping pallets [PS4], I immediately camp their asses after hooking them. Now, I hate when killers go camping as much as the next guy, but goddamn it really gets to me, and I need retribution. 
---
This one dude cussed me out after teabagging and I camped him, and my response was fairly simple: you teabag like a bitch, you get camped like a bitch.
---
The mustache kept him sane
---
Killers literally complained so much that the devs nerfed survivor perks into the ground yet they are the ones that cry too much hahah this community is absolutely insane. 
---
I swear Jane looks like my new assistance manager at my job
---
Oh man this seems like a bad sign… I’ve seen stuff like this happen before. A game gets to a stage where the developers themselves almost… like… misunderstand their own game? (If that’s a good way to put it) Almost as if they don’t realize that what they *want* for the game doesn’t make any sense for what the game *is*.
---
no. Why would you not hit them anyways, just in case?
---
Same...Rank 3 and no skill. I've only been playing for a month and I don't survive very often but pip anyways. Occasionally get trash talked by killers for my rank and my deaths, lol. I don't have all purple perks, or a bunch of cool teachable perks from different characters so I feel less cool than other people in high ranks haha. I do the same thing as you. Unhook people, do gens, usually die in chases and pip. Hopefully we'll both improve!

Ugh. Those people absolutely suck. However, most of them are probably just 9 year olds with way too much time on their hands. Or full grown adults with no actual life. Usually if they say they're good, it basically just means they have no social life and either live in a tiny cramped apartment, or are living in the basement with big bubba sawyer.
---
HIGH QUALITY H20
---
Lol loads of people have that name. It probably wasn't them 
---
I'm sorry but this is just a hoodie and paper machet for an already low effort killer... At least wear it or something.
---
What's next? Pictures of chainsaws? 
---
Yeah, this guy was an adult and from what I understand most of the time he spends not playing the game is spent smoking weed.
---
Awesome tattoo, but how the hell is sewing yourself back together selfish?
---
Oddly specific, but okay. 
---
Does holding it longer after the bar is full make it go farther or something?
---
Slight confuse. 
---
There is and this is it
---
Not gonna lie, really digging All In
---
I think it’s more like the bar is indicative of how far it can/will go. Don’t quote me on that though.
---
I'm just gonna say never, and be pleasantly surprised if it ever happens.
---
Oh boy. The double whammy. Druggie and a video game addict with too much time.
---
Well I have, It's called Dead By Daylight. IDK if you've heard of it.
---
I got lucky doing that achievement, went against a 4 man Dwights
---
The trick here, they apparently were all high and stoned, because when I sneaked near the gen two were doing and I got my tier 2, they posted in the end game chat that they were scared to hell out of nowhere and stoned too
---
I think you are absolutely right. Its not an open discussion if its "Disgusting white knights vs Good people" OP is wrong and we all know it.
---
I got to about rank 5-6 with nurse and then started to get my ass handed to me every game.
---
Put in many hours trying to get better, no use. Nurse is just dogshit on console, no way around it.
---
Between the shaking screen during fatigue and survivor bullying, it's a pretty miserable experience. 
---
Ugh, except that's not universal at all. I'm on PC in New Zealand and can barely play killer at all cause the wait times are attrocious.
---
Why are you being downvoted? I can see the confusion 
---
Not too sure.
---
Might be the players who like to use her so they can hide better and they don’t want that changed 
---
I am not getting paid, I just simply have a different opinion about the streamer. The title of the post is "open debate" so I assumed other opinions are free to share.
---
I don't think there are any restrictions on who you can respond to or how many times you can respond to people in a comment section. 
---
If people can freely share their concerns about Jendenise I should too be free to share what I think are responses to those concerns, which I base on facts and personal experiences. 
---
I am responding to the things that you say, I am not bringing in random tidbits that are not relevant to the topic. I have a different opinion about the topic so it's likely that I will be less likely to agree with you on things. It doesn't help that you keep ignoring parts of my responses and repeat things as if I didn't address them before.
---
I like how Claudette has DS ready. 
---
I've been here virtually everyday since the sub started as a use and a mod, comment daily and post every other day. The OP is bitter his copy+paste noeffort shitpost got removed and has been harassing me since trying to get a rise put of me. Lol. 
---
Invisible man.
---
Most exhausting for me was skilled huntress because I play on console and when I got it you needed 100 downs from over 24 meters away with huntress. That was my hardest achievement but I was pretty happy after I got it. Then they had to go and change the requirements to 20 downs.
---
For real, I have a black neighbor I talk to when we both go out to smoke, and 90% I don’t even know he’s out there lol
---
Well, weed isn't exactly bad for you, atleast not more than cigarettes are, but people see this and think that it's okay to do other drugs, they feel like they're superior to you somehow because they smoke, or their dealer starts lacing addictive shit in it. I don't care if someone vapes or smokes weed or cigarettes, but I don't want them doing it in any room I have to be in, and I don't want them to do it near me without me okaying it because A. I don't need to get high. B. Whether it's vape or cigs, there are still toxins in that shit, asides from actual smoke in both cigs and weed. And C. The shit stinks.
---
HE’S A MENACE!

Also he won’t tombstone on hits on vaults or if they hide in lockers

Survivor : Destroyed by pallets and logic 😎😎😎

Lol 
---
If Dwight isn't gay, then I want a refund. 
---
I scare 
---
It's not running on the phone 
---
Dwight is gay and a bottom.
---
I've just started playing again - played about 1 week so far. Most people are fine post game chat. Maybe it's the red ranks or something. everyone is just "gg wp". There's an occasional lunatic, but nothing to lose a sweat about.
---
I also started playing Overwatch on competitive. Seriously, fuck those people. Screaming into mics and acting like disappointed McDonald shift managers when things don't go their way. I find OW far more toxic than dbd. 
---
Gen tap to avoid getting grabbed most of the time. typically she'll come out of phase to grab you, but you'll have just finished your tap or just begin another, at which point she won't grab and instead attacks you. Seems to be the only counter to prayer beads aside from watching out for moving grass.
---
Truly worth an award
---
Exactly I don’t understand why survivors aren’t saying anything mid rank is gonna be way harder ranks, since they’ll be fighting previously rank 1 killers 
---
Sometimes it is, IMO. For really strong pallets, like killer shack and ones in the Asylum, or that one pallet in the corner tile of The Game, I'll take a hit if it's still early in the game. Last thing I want to do is drop god pallet before a gen gets popped, and pallets like those usually create a hell of a dead zone when they're gone.
---
survivors were nerfed because they were OP. There is 4 of you - the game needs to be balance with that in mind. It wasn't
---
Personal experience advice to anyone trying to pull this off themselves, forget the fragrant tuft of hair, use one of the lesser hair add-ons instead. I used the purple lock of hair, got two kills in the first EW3, got the other two in the second EW3. Make sure you kill people you've drained a lot of Evil from already, and you should be able to get 2 or 3 EW3s in a game. Being able to get EW3 faster means earlier kills and an easier game.
---
*Kills Survivors, then kills self*
---
*1 point away from Black Pip*

Honestly I think BHVR did a good job on the new killer, because I find it fun to play as her and against her, and it also doesn't fucking erase my pc off the face of the earth with the vomit.
---
A burning sensation when you pee
---
Yeah but how do survivors rank up in the new system when they face the noobish camper killers that don't let any room for altruism? It seems the devs also don't want survivors to just do gens and escape so how does every piece come together? Do survivor's pips depend on killers too now?
---
Nice.
---
Just lost my shit
---
.
---
I can’t find it
---
Surprised Jake was one of the least common survivors, I usually play with a decent number of Jakes
---
congratulations
---
you played yourself
---
Yeah at least I faced the facts
---
You play a game, you get XP for your player account. Each level up give you more Shards per level until you reach level 99 and then you get a Devotion level, and it starts all over again. 
---
I would assume it's based off of your Emblems. I honestly don't know that part.
---
It doesn't indicate how far the vomit will go ,it about how MUCH vomit is thrown at the surviour 
---
Jane don't need add-ons.
---
oh shit, i’m a dummy LMAO
---
AND IF YOU’D HAD BEEN THERE
---
Thanks 
---
I tbagged a Freddy cause he was tunneling me and I got hooked, camped, saved, and tunneled even after adrenaline popped. I was the only one hooked and looped him for 5 gens. All three left me for no fucking reason. He didn’t have noed. They’re just bitches. 
---
The tbag was important bc that was his reasoning for tunneling and camping. He was using a splinter offering, and I looped him at the silo for 4 gens. He’s just wasn’t good. 
---
Doctor and Clown are sort of the same in that they disrupt the Survivors in some way. Pig is just a partial stealth, partial game delayer. 
---
Out of all of them, Clown is probably the easiest albeit the least effective of the three. If you want "fun", then you should get Doctor over Clown. However, Clown has some good add-ons in comparison to the others.
---
I'm a Clown main, so I enjoy Clown over the other two. 
---
Jesus Christ that was awesome
---
Please, nobody question why this was made or she might not make another.
---
The difference between people who belong at rank 1 and rank 10 are tremendous. 
---
Rank 1 killers/survivors will have a full perk load out as well as add ons (depends on the person/killer) and the knowledge of the game. 
---
Rank 10 killers/survivors are normally still experimenting (if they aren't being slow to rerank) may not have 4 perks and items/addons as well as lack the knowledge of the game that someone who belongs at rank 1
---
Those are big differences between those ranks. And I said belong in those ranks not rushed to those ranks or farmed to those ranks
---
 Starting to think that you don't know what opinion is 
---
As a spirit main I agree. I pretty much boycott them and only use them rarely for memes but I never tryhard with it
---
I actually don’t care that the survivors don’t correspond with the killers. I like that they’re modern.
---
It’s cool for survivors from 2018 to meet some random ass bitch from before Christ
---
The new Wizard of Oz game looks great
---
I'd rather have her from behind.
---
Wee wooo weee woo!
---
Someone has to be hooked AFTER the gates are open 
---
That reference was a+
---
Me too but I play them because I want Frank to penetrate me.
---
I hate golden legacy players , all of them are straight up cunts 
---
Love this spreadsheet! I’ve been thinking of doing something similar. What system do you play on?
---
Yeah that creeped me out, this says that dbd has a lot of potential to be scary but devs never think about it 
---
No, you clearly cant comprehend what I said. Belongs-(of a person) fit in a specified place or environment. Hope that helps you understand what I said.
---
I play a good Spirit game. Love prayer beads.
---
You're still entirely correct.
---
I explained why people at high ranks don't necassarly have complete perks and game knowledge.
---
It doesn't matter that they belong there or not, they rushed to red ranks by spamming the game, you will get them in your games whether they belong in them or not. The end effect for both of them is the same, the player is bad.
---
Reeee Nerf killer swing speed 360s not strong enough
---
Thanks for the entertainment, got to read all the comments and see 1 person hop into every comment thread and defend who shall not be named. As a content creator and big hand in the pot they should be held to higher standards. That's my opinion and it wont change, while fogwhispers isnt a paid spot on the team or w/e anyone wants to say it does make them public figures for the game and they should be held as such, because they aren't a regular player anymore 
---
Bruh now imma do this
---
If you're ever curious about the perks and add-ons, then you need to wait until the end. Or just go on the wiki and look at them.
---
Permanently?
---
Me on spectator mode watching my friends fuck up
---
thats what i was thinking.  and then its gonna cause even more deranking on the survivor side.
---
I just tunnel them until they rage quit.
---
Usually I just down them and let them bleed out but I carry them for a bit to draw out their anger.
---
And let them carry on running then instantly down them again.
---
Do survivors actually do that? I'm not sure I've ever seen that
---
slick AF 360s
---
Why you all draw Jane like she doesn't look like Sreck ? 
---
Complaining about NOED
---
Not breaking totems
---
Well people forget gg means good game. Not every game is good game, when I loose to slugging nurse, or no sound spirit I never type gg, because it never is a good game, you just get shit on and that's that. I type gg when killer outplays as, or if I actually had a good time in a game.
---
Dw both sides despise it.
---
I actually like seeing a healthy amount of Tom foolery in a match. Keeps us sane. 
---
As I said, people bitch around rather than try something new.
---
NOED is so easy to counter. Destroy the totems!
---
Siri, how do I delete someone else’s post? 
---
I started playing because I had a ritual for her, and now o love Rancor. Always letting my obsession barely escape, and then practically begging them the last non-obsessed survivor to finish the last ten so I can omae wa mou shindeiru my obsession
---
It's actually the first region where I learned that maps follow a template instead of being completely random. That moment of revelation gives me fond memories for, like, the first half second when I spawn into it.
---
Gen tapping.
---
Context?
---
Probably because killers almost never get nerfed 
---
Also just pressing it when you are close enough sometimes might not be enough.
---
If you have tombstone or tombstone piece, you need to wait till a prompt appears at the bottom of the screen. It will say kill. That's when you know you're good to go.
---
I love the Spirit as I consider her to be a masterpiece, the developers outdid themselves with her but I do find the weeb fan art to be cringey
---
Agreed. Or they at least could have made Jane a scholar of some kind who researched/uncovered information on the Plague.
---
I can see his pee-pee
---
You are really slow, you usually depend on getting stacks of "Play with your food" perk alongside really really slow stalking speed.
---
Lol live in denial all you want. Survivors have had it easy since release.
---
If you want people to reply to your entire post, don't write a fucking novel.
---
Yeah just hope she doesn't get lucky and grabs you mid tap.
---
It slows generator progress just by existing, and it's still a free hit even if she doens't get a grab.
---
You not knowing in any way that she's on her way is stupid.
---
Inb4 reddit killers coming to say camping when the gens are done isn’t toxic at all, and that the other 3 survivors aren’t objectives still on the map lol. 
---
But god forbid you chill at the exit gate for extra points, that’s definitely not the same thing. 
---
Chat was so... Civil!
---
You asked and I delivered. Just use one of the many crutch perks to counter her. Simple.
---
I mean I maines killer from release until last chapter so it’s not really denial saying a+ teir killers have it too easy right now and that billy/nurse/spirit could use nerfs to their addons
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
This makes my heart happy &lt;3 this game can be frustrating from both perspectives so it's nice when to see someone not get screwed over by camper/tunnel killers or teammates who abandon you.
---
Its 16 perks vs 4. Get creative.
---
I’m telling you I’ve tried it. It doesn’t work.
---
No. I haven't come across another tombstone. But at the time I was in evil within 3
---
Grim pantry isn't too bad. Pale Rose is awful though. 
---
I'm overall happy with the killer, I think she's above Myers but below Hag power level wise.
---
I have one suggestion for a buff, might be too strong but I just have it as an idea.
---
I think that if all of the fountains get clensed after all of them become corrupted then I think she should recive corrupted purge as if she picked it up from one of the fountains. That way she is rewarded by spreading the sickness to everyone. Might be a bit too strong, since all of the fountains getting clensed is also your fault since you are making a mistake by not using her empowered ability.
---
It's apparently supposed to stop camping, but it just makes killing survivors quick a punishment. I don't want to bring any moris because of this new trash ranking system.
---
So a 7? 
---
Spirit Fury Tier IIII
---
One of many crutch perks? Like?
---
I know that having 4 boxes on the map gives a 50% chance to escape the rbt each time a box is checked, but what about if additional boxes were added on the map? Does it affect its chances?
---
Like wolfenstein
---
What are you talking about, Im a rank one killer lol, plus you dont even know what build or killers I use surveillance with. How would you know if I'd get better results
---
Having recently re-watching this movie, it bothers me that the screenshot used in this meme is not the same shot as when he actually say the line in the movie.
---
I stopped being scared like 40 hours into the game. Not because of selfcare, just because I got used to it. Myers still creeps me out btw 
---
I am already working on that survey. Should be done bye tommorow. Just need 23more tests.
---
what are you on about? you hear her footsteps in phase. i've never had a problem with Beads Rin
---
You delivered a bad answer as that's not counterplay at all.
---
It's like saying "just hide" as counterplay to nurse.
---
Which crutch perk do you think helps vs her? Spine chill? Yeah just run spine chill that is shit vs literally anything else.
---
With the removal of DS there is literally 0 crutch perks for the survivors.
---
You dont play much do ya? Lol.
---
Even mother's dwelling with the right windows open.
---
or when she phases in terror. still hear the footsteps.
---
Learned that lesson the hard way yesterday. We were in the exit with Myers and I walked quite slowly to give the other players enough time to open the other gate they were at. My mate said "hurry he's got a mori"... Well he should have mentioned this grabbing thing too. Died because I wanted to let him hit me one more time xD
---
Yep. Probably because injured survivors are easy to find in phase walk. "Mindgame" killer
---
Keep crying.
---
Wowie you are rank one killer, that's amazing.
---
Whispers, nurse's calling, even bitter murmur. All of them will be of much more use than that.
---
Take that bitches shoes
---
Thank god
---
It really is, i wanted to thank a huntress today for not slugging for a 4k like so many other killers do, cuz it drags the game on for so long and i just wanna die and start my 20 minute search for the next one. They left game as soon as it ended, so i decided to comment on their profile, it was private. (PC btw). then i friend requested them but they ignored it. 
---
Piggle if youre out there, thanks for not making me sit on the ground doing nothing while you look for the other person forever. The game ended with me getting hooked, rescued, the rescuer getting hooked, then them killing themselves on the hook (idk why, i was right there to save them) and i got the hatch. I dont even care if i had died that game, my time wasnt wasted by a killer who HAS to 4k every game and slug to do so.
---
Honestly I can't understand those people who call out for a Noed rework. You literally just have to cleanse the totems in order for Noed to not activate, it's so simple but so many people complain. Use Detective's Hunch or Small game to Locate the totems and then cleanse them. Noed acts like a genrush punishment: If you rush the gens without caring about the totems, you pay the price by being insta downed, it's as easy as that. Noed was unfair quite a time ago when it wasn't affected by the totems but since it is, it's not that big of a problem anymore.
---
I’d be okay with nurse choking me
---
Great argument.
---
You've done nothing but offer counters to the build...so. good one lul.
---
You're acting like the killers don't have anything that's overly strong.
---
Have you reported that in the bug report section on the forum?
---
because that does not happen for me, and so I would not report it myself.
---
I know I know. Cleansing 5 totems is super hard for you.
---
Who said I wasnt using nurses? Also, again, you don't even know what killers or build Im using.
---
Besides, the only reason i brought up meaningless rank is because you said better results. If Im consistently 3k or 4k at rank 1, what better results exist than that? Obviously none.
---
Why did no one say anything of the P3 Jake with a chainsaw?
---
*strained breathing*
---
What? Counters to what build? What are you talking about?
---
I'm saying that there are perks that are stronger than it as their effects are better than survelliance's. It has more uses.
---
Object of depression 
---
1. they're both stealth killers. 2. most pig mains are brain dead and just camp/tunnel 3. nobody plays pig seriously because her power is so inconsistent.
---
If they keep this wonky ass new ranking system I'll just ignore ranking up.   I'll just play for the fun of it and if I rank up, cool.  
---
It's not about always making good killers. It's also not about having all killers do the same think. Freddy is unique and his power allows him to slow down the game, he also has great tracking cause of his power an certain add-ons make his tracking even better. Yes he lacks chase power, but a chase should not only me determined by the power of the killer, you shouldn't win chases cause you are playing killer it should be a matter of skill, this is a big issue with Bloodlust IMO, it feels like as a survivor you get punished by going on long chases. 
---
aand thats the reason they made the changes for killer pipping really, because if you play this game casually as survivor killers that play like their real life is on stake make survivors game boring and unplayable. The problem that the game has is the devs forgot that it should at least be kinda fun, even if you are the first to die. What is nothing fun is to get farmed and tunnelled as a solo, then you have people that kill themselves in hook, dcs and now this patch. I don't think it's well made tho, I think the killer should have incentives to go for others, not detriments for playing as logic would tell you to do. It's kinda a complicated problem i think.
---
People who DC are simply the worst players in the game. They are worse than the supposed toxic Legion players. They are worse than the very concept of current Freddy.  
---
They are the epitome of toxicity and uselessness, and the only people who are as bad as them are the ones who suicide on the first hook less than a minute into a match.
---
👏 Her 👏 Name 👏 Is 👏 Amanda 👏
---
If someone farms in front of me,  the person that did the farming gets put on the hook and tunneled afterward.  Hate that. 
---
Your skill as a survivor doesnt really matter vs a  good spirit, its just a guess, and the odds are not in your favour.
---
How so?
---
ToXiC SuRvIVoRs ArE RuInInG ThE GaMe!
---
Nurse is freeeeeeeeeee!
---
Wait this sucks it's just a bunch of campfires
---
Perhaps you cannot understand because you play swf as a survivor? Destroying 5 totems is a collective team effort, something that doesn't occur often in solo games. 
---
End game usually have less pallets and ways of defending yourself so going up against 119% speed m1 instant down killer seem like something out of balance. 
---
NOED is not gen rush counter, it is a crutch like DS or Adrenaline. NOED is more unfair now that even level 1 of the perk is now as useful as level 3 which makes this perk a 'go to' for every player that cannot secure a kill or two before the game ends. 
---
The speed buff should be in reverse; you are 4/3/2% slower but you're able to one shot survivors. Just one of the lazy adjustment to a perk that requires rework.
---
This was really cute, now I want to see more interactions in this style. Like plague puking and hag trying to copy her
---
&gt; kiddo
---
Ah yes, the insult of the adult.
---
And the perks are still too powerful.
---
Thanks for the help! I'll definetly will be using Enduring, hovewer im worried to get gen rushed without Ruin, since my mobility doesnt really matter if im chasing someone, additionaly to that I've been busy leveling other Killers for their teachables so that I got barely any experience with Billy, thus I will propably wont be able to optimize his mobility to the fullest extent for some time, Do you think Ruin, Nurses Calling, BBQ &amp; Enduring is a good enough build?
---
I play most of the time solo and I like the challenge of cleansing them, just my opinion
---
I will go for your teammate anyway because I don't condone farming each other like that.
---
If you t-bag me then you might end up just changing my mind.
---
Shut up you melon head and enjoy the post
---
As a solo survivor I'm having issues following what people are complaining about, the counter is their and very straight forward and in majority of games survivors spawn next to a totem and clear them. 
---
I further don't get how if clearing totems/NOED is REALLY that big of a deal why you wouldn't use something like the small game perk to make clearing all the totems a cakewalk. 
---
NOED is the punishment for not clearing totems, Old DS is punishment for picking up a survivor to hook them like you're supposed to. Survivors just need to remember totems are part of their objectives.
---
Yerp.
---
trappers reaction: FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
This is the DBD SUBREDDIT. No jokes or fun allowed in this establishment! 
---
You should be able to play killer without any difficulties. Survivor however also depends on how good the killer's internet is. Dedicated servers are coming in a few months anyway so it shouldn't be a huge deal with that part right now anyway (just dodge high ping lobbies)
---
I'm biased because I main her, but I love playing against spirit. Since I played spirit a lot I know exactly how they think, which makes playing against her not a guessing game but rather a predicting game (and tbh most spirits assume you're a dumb survivor, so it's easy predicting their first move).
---
Yes the odds are against you, as should be the case with any killer. You CAN make chases last pretty long though, which can cost her the game or at least a few survivors. 
---
Then you proc dying light with the dead Meg. Then the Claudette gets DS and now dying light is unprocced 
---
literally on console all you have to do is run into the killer and chances are they will miss since the fps is so ass.
---
Whoa is this og?
---
his hands aren’t touching the tv, don’t trust him he’s not doing his job correctly 
---
It's basically a copy, but the grind is heavier and the killer also has a top down perspective, so once you are found it is almost impossible to escape. After the first hit you get a short speed burst, but once that's over you start limping and leaving literal bloody footprints
---
I dont like the salt. It gets me worked up. Some people say gg but not usually. 
---
Who cares?
---
WTF slugging bitch killer KYS and uninstall idiot.

---
Likely post game chat after being nice and not last hooking someone.

---
Just wow... Really showing your gay there, huh?
---
At rank 1 they don't give a good god damn about your plight unfortunately.
---
I bet you watch Farmer John huh
---
I love playing Amanda, I think she’s underrated. However, I’d say 80% of pigs play her like a prick. Most pigs will tunnel your ass so hard you wonder why she bothers trapping you. A lot camp too, they just crouch and wait till the unhook. I know there’s good pigs out there but they’re pretty rare.

&gt;We clearly have a very different way of playing. What I do when I play is sleep everyone then go for chases. This means all survivors have 50% reduction to action speed. I also have "global" vision on them. 
---
Unless you are running Class Photo, putting everyone to sleep before going for a chase will result in a very slow process. Survivors will also be actively attempting to escape from the dream state while this is happening. Resulting in a Sisyphus scenario most of the time as you attempt to herd cats. Unless you have good concentrations of survivors with bad luck clumped on certain parts of the map the average time to get a skill check on a gen is about 12.5 seconds. Which allows for survivors to get out of the dream state rather easily even without other survivors aid. The knowledge of where survivors are located is important and can allow for more transitions as survivors being woken up visibly crouch allowing you to sleep more survivors. However due to Freddy's average movement speed being able to get everyone into the sleep state before committing to a chase is a bit long winded. If a survivor is far enough away it doesn't matter if you know where they are if they move after they miss their skill check.
---
Your strategy is what many would label as a *dream scenario* to pull off quickly. The problem even with this tactic is that while it allows for you to choose your targets after managing to pull it off at best you've stalled the game a little bit. At worst the effort to put everyone to sleep has resulted in progression on the objectives of the survivors without you progressing your side of the game very much. 
---
What happens next is that you choose your survivor to run after for a bit, after about 30 seconds of running around you've likely seen all other survivors snap out of dream state. Hopefully the chase is short but it is rather possible that you'll be looped. Even when you were able to choose the most vulnerable survivor to focus on the survivors are already working on the gens. You hook the survivor and you got the regular 2 gen pop. If survivors haven't managed to get other gens while you were trying to get all the other survivors to bed. 
---
Now if you are lucky you might be able to switch targets if the survivor you're running after is giving you trouble if one of the survivors hasn't gotten out of dream yet. Or simply disengage from the chase and choose someone as they will have to take a bit to get out of dream and heal themselves if needed. This is an upside of Freddy. Which is heavily softened by the ease of getting out of dream state. 
---
Less of a repercussion for abandoning chases is nice but it does little when your little safety bump is very small and often short. Also I do know what Freddy's power does, if you want to quote the wiki just quote the wiki.
---
Also your last comment is really annoying for a variety of reasons. The most glaring of them is the sort of haughty nature you have about people not touching Freddy before they write him off as being bad. 
---
I've touched Freddy. Multiple times. I've touched him so hard that I was able to check for prostate cancer. I've touched him hard enough to get an undead child molester to consider filing a restraining order.
---
Yeah sure, I haven't done a full body dissection like it seems you have done but unless his appendix is a viable pipe bomb. 
---
His problems.
---
Are important.
---
For as much as I enjoy Freddy. I am also the guy that enjoyed *Ganon in Brawl*. And for an even better analogy 
---
&gt;"You could consider Meta Knight to be a weak character in Brawl due to his weak damage and low weight"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"That would be a stupid idea"  
---
&gt;"Meta Knight is broken because he is the best in every other aspect"
---
Freddy is just barely serviceable in every other aspect.
---
Lets review the elephant in the room.
---
&gt;Same for Freddy, the 7 second dream transition doesn't matter if you don't chase survivors who are falling asleep. 
---
You do realize that people can get out of dream state right? You realize that the ease of doing so is Freddy's biggest flaw? You hopefully realize that if a survivor does get out of dream state while you are searching for another survivor that means you will not have another target to go for?
---
That means, and you guessed it! You will have to wait 7 seconds to go after a survivor or possibly more!
---
Oh even better btw. Because people can break out of dream state that means that people will not be walking around with a 50% reduction in action speed. Meaning that they can do things like complete gens, break hex totems, unhook teammates, escape via the hatch or gate without the even small worry that there will be consequences to their actions. And even if there is that consequence is very well telegraphed and they are allowed a good amount of time to get to a better location.
---
Survivor is running to the exit gate? Freddy has NOED? Doesn't matter if they are close enough because guess what (7 second dream transition). Freddy lacks the ability to properly punish survivors unless they are in a state that is very easy to break out of. This is not something that if I did a cost benefit analysis on would be outweighed by Freddy's upsides. At best he breaks even.
---
He is bad. I hope I don't need to provide another 2 page report on him past midnight again. You ain't Wobbles, and Freddy ain't Ice Climbers. 
---
Some of us just prefer a killer you can play agianst where your skill as survivor matter instead of a killer who diesnt take skill just run at you with no counterplay to it. 
---
To be honest this will result in skillful rank 1 killers and rank 1 camper killers who also know what they are doing either get a black pip or -1 pip and will play with lower ranks. And when they fall into those lower ranks they can do whatever the F they please since they will be trashing other low rank survivors.
---
Please someone replace the fountain with Romero's bootay.
---
Yeah they’re bad for it. I mean let’s face it most killers tunnel anyways, it’s rare you get unhooked and the killer isn’t back on your ass instantly but it’s easy for a spirit. She just waits and phases back, survivor panics and runs so she has your tracks. 
---
&gt;New Zealand
---
Tell us WHAT perk instead of being dumb. Cant wait to know what perk prevent invisible instadown on action.
---
Cue funky bass
---
Nah man, a lot of people struggle against her. I might be unpopular with this but she needs a soft nerf. Nothing too serious but something that makes her phasing in chase have some way of telling. Its way too fucking easy to "mindgame" with her because unlike you the spirit can do some kind of tracking and you just stand there and take it. I heard many streamers say they don't like going against her and killer mains themselves say that a good spirit will end you no matter what. I just don't like abilities that can fuck you up without the killer having to be skilled. The passive phasing, the fact that even if you call her play you get hit... It's kinda annoying. I would take insta saw billy or a nurse over her anytime.
---
then everyone clapped.
---
They should add Shrek as a killer instead.
---
What the fuck?They nerfed spine chill? Lmfao
---
Holy shit, since when can the killers spawn in the survivor Lobby? Smh my head
---
Can confirm. Doesn't know. 
---
I was playing against a Jake yesterday and bless his heart he was trying but he kept getting turned around in lery's and running into me. It took about 4 pity slug for me to finally put him out of his misery.
---
Mori’s have been nerfed
---
This would be far from a decent rework. This would become a perk that damages you more than no mither does. You will be unable to shake off the killer, they will always know exactly where you are and while you also know the exact location of the killer, a killer knowing an exact survivor location is way more valuable than a survivor knowing the exact killer location
---
Nurse: "lol, let's see the Plague do this! Stupid bitch." 
---
It's different tho, I see when a huntress winds up, and I see where I can hide. I hear when a billy revs up and I know I have windows and loops to protect me. Even if I know the spirit is phasing it's just stupid guessing. You can't really do the walk away thing because she is so fucking fast you just make yourself vulnerable and you won't make it far. If you are really (and I mean really) lucky you might smack her with a pallet, but even vaulting windows won't get you far.
---
Billy trying to pole-dance for the first time 
---
&gt; Unless you are running Class Photo, putting everyone to sleep before going for a chase will result in a very slow process.
---
This is the exact way I play, this and skill check add-ons (Green Dress). It doesn't matter if it takes time, it's about winning.
---
&gt; You do realize that people can get out of dream state right? You realize that the ease of doing so is Freddy's biggest flaw? You hopefully realize that if a survivor does get out of dream state while you are searching for another survivor that means you will not have another target to go for?
---
Yes OFC survivors wan wake up, but it isn't a big deal tbh, you just right click them again, this gives you a proc of class photo and you can go on.
---
&gt; Oh even better btw. Because people can break out of dream state that means that people will not be walking around with a 50% reduction in action speed. Meaning that they can do things like complete gens, break hex totems, unhook teammates, escape via the hatch or gate without the even small worry that there will be consequences to their actions.
---
I constantly try and keep everyone asleep so this doesn't become a big issue.
---
&gt; Survivor is running to the exit gate? Freddy has NOED? Doesn't matter if they are close enough because guess what (7 second dream transition).
---
This I can agree on, at the end game it gets hard if no one is sleeping. But Freddy can stall the game long enough to where you don't reach this stage of the match.
---
Here are the patch notes
---
[https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patches](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patches)
---
The spirit was 2.3.0 
---
"This isn't too bad, instead of repetitive generators I'm doing repetitive digging now."
---
Chucky DLC.
---
"Get over here you little Shit!"
---
I really want a Chucky that constantly cusses. 
---
This was hilarious
---
People hate the legion because unless he's brain dead, he gets a guaranteed hit. he can then moonwalk to bleed you out, basically forcing you to go down with zero counterplay.
---
It's not op, it's just anti-fun.
---
They are a badly designed killer and thusly are disliked by the community. 
---
Wow. Interesting.
---
I have been playing him with no perks or add ons, and I usually get respect. No camping, and I always try to get jump scares. 
---
No, then it would be too strong.  
---
Every survivor would just run to the closest locker.  
---
The killer would be forced to either leave the survivor alone or be stunned for 3 seconds.  
---
It would be a stupid stand off.  
---
well its gonna be hard because not everyone doing the same thing like dwight is hiding but jake is sabotaging hooks or claudette healing someone . BP given by the time played is a lot worst for toxic players.
---
oh wow it took me a while to get it
---
__I also follow a drawing sub, I saw this and thought... This would be perfect for the deadbydaylight sub! Then I realized...__
---
I totally get that.  I must be low rank because 95% of the time I see another survive get hit,  they get downed 5 seconds later. It's so rare to see someone get that first hit and then survive. 
---
I have about 2mbps internet and only get accused of being a lag switcher ever 3 or so matches so you should be fine.
---
Never said it was bad for killer. its not. It creates a wasted time aspect. hence the mention of sloppy butcher. 
---
Oh, thats interesting! I do like that idea. Trying to keep tabs on how many fountains are left is a bit tricky, so I can see the scenario happen. Pretty cool idea. 
---
You should've used that "Daddy Myers" skin if you really want to get the community upset.
---
Even though I despise Legion I have to agree with you on Myers so... have my upvote. 
---
How does it create a “wasted time aspect”?
---
Daddy Myers pls frick me
---
Too bad it will only be 5 frames per second
---
I grinded out shards for the Spirit and she was definitely worth it, but I nearly burnt myself out on the game in the process. My take from the footage I've seen so far is she'll be stronger than the Spirit on console and PC. If you're really into the game, it's probably worth it. With only 3000 or so left to go it's really not that much farther.
---
They said in patch note it’d be a lot harder. I’m not too sure if what it currently is on PTB servers is what they mean, because it is RIDICULOUSLY hard to pip.
---
I love this game but I have recently stopped looking for groups on xbox after being falsey accused of being a stalker. People are weird in the dbd community.
---
In this patch. When the king loses the crown people gonna look for a new king. Right now DS is in the centre but next one on the chopping block will most likely be NOED. 
---
So you're the one I keep getting paired with 🤔
---
I'm fine with making it harder because it was so easy to pip up as killer but this is a bit ridiculous. I hope it's just a bug and that the real new system is a bit easier
---
thanks so much for the answers, it's a relief to know that even with garbage internet I can still play the game. :&gt;
---

---
Oh I know but I don’t know what Sreck is ^(/s)
---
They better go and play CiV 5 if they have a issue.
---
Im trying to sneak around. 
---
Not much has happened since Spirit overall. We got Legion and Jeff chapter about to get a new one on the coming weeks.
---
Entity isn’t a killer
---
Literally the best teeth in the game
---
Yeah, because being able to instantly mori someone no matter what takes skill, you're right bud, my bad
---
At leaat you can extend the chase for 5 gens if you are good legion removes all of this from the game, because of his no skilled and no counterplay kit
---
I had to do a system restore when this happened to myself.
---
They were probably using either add-ons or perks.
---
But I'm dummy thick.
---
Np, I personally love the Susie cosmetic and could never hate legion due to that, but their flaws are clear imo
---
Some perks got buffed to a useable state for both killer and survivor such as leader and prove thyself for survivor and spies of the shadows and surveillance for killer. 
---
The 2 new killers have appeared with the plague being the most recent and legion which was released near Christmas. 
---
Legion was a disappointment of a killer with having a powe that kind of break the way the game is meant to be played and has overall recieved very negative reception. Playing him without addons makes him relatively weak whereas using certain addons makes him absurdly op. 
---

---
Aftercare
---
When you heal a survivor or save them you can both see each other aura over unlimited distance.

---
Poised
---
When completiting a gen you leave no scratch marks for 10 seconds
---
Some healing perk (Cant remember name) 
---
You heal 50% the rate of what you heal another survivor. A good perk for reducing heal time especially if you have we will make it.
---
Big changes; 
---
Distressing gets 100% bonus BP for killers - PTB
---
Decisive has been nerfed so that it activates for 60 seconds after being unhooked. You cant be dribbled with it anymore. Its now an anti-tunnel perk were if you are tunneled after being unhooked you can DS and escape the killer. -PTB
---
Ruin now applies its effects at all tiers but with less regression for goods at the lower tiers. - PTB
---
It limited his power, now he is not restrained by the limitations of Reality
---
No winners or losers here. Just great humor!
---
Wow..
---
 That's what i call a good use for a uno reverse card
---
&gt;I hate to say it, but a bad spawn is just the pits
---
Yeah, [tell me about it](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/xl-pharcyde-lx/screenshot/11692258)
---
For those who care for it she seems to be speaking portuguese : "Atanecam y meam asabumem" -&gt; "their getting to me very fast" (really rough translation as I only know Latin and a bit of spanish)
---
,which would be fitting when we speak about a somewhat maya culture after the colonial times.
---
I'd personally pay as I want the extra outfit.  Unlike Legion, she's actually fun and looks cool.  Speaking of Legion, I actually have a lot of Iridiscent shards (around 28,000) but even then I still haven't been able to convince myself to spend it on Legion and Jeff. 
---
Normally you'd be right, but because the hit registration is so ass in the game, he always just teleports through space and time past the windows and pallets to tickle my scrotum with his knife lmao, then again I am just bad at the game, I actually find it easier to escape the legion than Mike, I always get killed by Mike, but I've escaped from the speedy kids more often than not
---
Não
---
Dribbling one person 3 different times when you down them takes as much time as just letting them use DS. Sure they won't get to use DS but if you have to dribble that one person each time you down them you'll be wasting as much time as if you just let them use it.
---
r/engrish
---
How would you buff it? Make it so it activates when there is 0/1/2 generators left?
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/50886/the-plague-s-dialogue-translated
---
Someone took a stab at trying to translate her mori speech. I'm pretty sure the devs will do a Q&amp;A as I believe they also did it for the legion as well with his designs. They seem to be really pleased with their creation as they made a behind the scenes video of the creation of the plague.
---
Actually I play both survivor and killer, I just don't have many clips of killer
---
There is a Q&amp;A on the Chapter as a whole so you can ask whatever you like here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/50856/q-a-ask-your-questions-on-chapter-11#latest
---
They're making it less about kills and more about spending as much time in each round as possible. It's not a good change, because as a killer, your incentive is to kill, not play tower defense
---
Ah, I see lol, the only killer I dc against is the spirit, because she legitimately freaks me out, thanks for not biting my head off about my opinion lol
---
And you don't know what a joke is
---
Totems take time too, you know. 
---
In theory, yes, but since its probably far away its impossible to tell which locker it was once hes in the area.
---
Well nea was the one who burned down crotus prenn  
---
Playing survivor I find is the easiest way to gain shards as games finish a lot quicker than killer games. Even if you dont preform well just staying in the match until you escape or die will net you a handsome reward that of course gets better as you level up in the game. 
---
As previously mentioned you can just buy auric cells to get access to her as it would be cheaper than buying the full dlc. 
---
The new survivor seems a bit lackluster imo so I would probably just get the killer.
---
Yep
---
Yes, i'm just saying that dribbling is not really a counter since it still wastes a lot of time
---
The OP didn't specify Killers though.
---
Ahh yes, might be that then :)
---
I mean they already shifted pips to make it harder on higher ranks. Why push it even further with emblem reworks? Not like we don't need it was N one form or another, but testing these changes one by one makes more sense to me. 
---
Or better yet, you look for the unhooker, can't find them, lose track of the wounded, unhooked survivor and they run straight up to you anyways for a pretty much free down
---
Possibility it's intentional to facilitate match-making?
---
Well we don’t know if the whispers are actual words or just nonsense (from a lore perspective)
---
They need to fine a middle ground for balance. I think dead in the middle of current live server ranking system with PTB will be perfect
---
I did not have an agrument. Just tought it was fun.
---
Fuck ,who’d you play against to be this upset?. You sound like a whiny fucking child , just stop
---
It's a perk that facilitates drawbacks for hitting your Obsession but rewards keeping them alive. This is very difficult to do, psychologically, if they're being an ass. 
---
Yeah, not even camping either. Many will let a hook person go into struggle so they can finish gens or totem while your chasing someone else far away. I cant make them unhook them eariler but get punished if they dont. 
---
I do think removing the bonus speed would make it way more fair.  
---
Only mommy jane can save dwight from daddy myers.
---
Saving post...
---
I think it would be better compared to his team running out onto the field and trying to bean him with the ball after batting.

There have been hand-made puppets and rather high quality cosplays posted time and time again of probably the easiest-to-cosplay character in the game(On account of a rather normal physique, and the fact that it can be both genders). Pair that with the only demanding piece being the mask(Hoodies aren't exactly hard to come by), and you have an overload of very easy to accomplish cosplay pictures
---
The fact that there's been numerous pictures having multiple cosplayers in a single picture at once doesn't help. Default legion is the most mind numbingly easy cosplay, which is why it gets flack. 
---
I get it, people want to feel like they can accomplish something distinct, unique and appreciated by the community, and something as easy as legion is the most straight forward path. The first few cosplays got extremely positive responses as well. It's just that we've seen it. A LOT. Like, A LOT a lot. That's the reason for the negative response. It's nothing personal, it's just fatigue turning to bitterness

Now rank TRULY won't matter because no matter how you play, you're likely to depip or get a black pip so everyone will be low rank!

Hey, I'm sorry to say, but on some rare occasions I'm the latter guy. 
---
If I'm up against a killer that I don't find fun or lacks counterplay (Freddy mainly) and I'm instantly found and hooked... I really don't feel the need to stick around in the match.
---
I have brief periods of respite in my life to unwind playing games, I don't always want to spend them not enjoying myself. 
---
There's still a chance she can grab you doing even that, but gen tapping takes longer to complete a gen than even powering through one with Ruin does on average, so that's pretty piss that Prayer Beads will bag her a hit AND slow gen progression down that greatly. 
---
I can respect that. 
---

---
Like I said, I love when add-ons alter the game. But this one is straight busted. 
---
So you're playing badly in tactic means, because when the gates are already opened(not only powered, opened) you won;t be able to hook anyone ;) 
---
Yeah dude iridescent head is totally fair, get in melee and get downed. Great design.
---
It should only instadown you if you hit it from longer range, that way you are rewarded for aiming good hatchets and shitty huntresses can't just bonk you because they are using something rare and call it fair.
---
Nurse still breaks all of the rules of the game and doesn't give you any counterplay, just because she doesn't have 3 blinks by defeault doesn't mean she's fair.
---
Wow you don't get to get morid instantly, now you only need to get tunneled off hook to get morid, cutting your time in game in half. That's so balanced dude, imagine if survivors had an offering that adds another extra hook stage.
---
If someone farms in front of me, I hit the farmed person to take away the safe unhook points from the farmer and then go straight at the farmer.

&gt; When the king loses the crown people gonna look for a new king. Right now DS is in the centre but next one on the chopping block will most likely be NOED.
---
Fuck that was nice to read. Are you a writer?
---
I'm curious to see how the rank distribution will be if they keep it this way. It might actually have a net positive result on queue times for purple ranks if barely anyone can reach rank 1. I hope so, anyway.
---
It just depends on if it’s impossibly hard to rank up or just balanced hard.
---
I don't mean that they need to make trash or OP killers. I want a normal mid level killer. For me it feels a lot more rewarding playing things people consider weak and doing good instead of being a meta slave. League is the perfect example. I played that game for 3 years and I always got a bunch of hate for playing non meta champions. People always seem to go to the conclusion after a character just releases that they are weak or OP almost instantly. Just look at Freddy and Legion. Sure the entire community may be against what I say about Freddy, but I believe that he is a decent killer. BHVR seem to look what the community has to say when it comes to doing reworks as well as buffs and nerfs. And look when Freddy was released, he was "op" according to the community so they made him weaker. 
---
I won't change my view, Freddy is a decent killer, he may have weaknesses like any killer, but they can be countered.
---
HyperX Cloud II.
---
Plugs into your controller and has great sound. Only £80, so I'd highly recommend them.
---
I’ll be waiting patiently 🖤 just like we all had to wait for DS :) 
---
I have an old ass pair of skullcandy headphones that allow you to adjust the bass (for music obviously) but even tho I got them years ago if I turn the bass all the way up I can hear everything.  
---
Just like every survivor can stall anywhere with Sprint Burst or Balanced Landing, and force the killer to have to come to them, then sprinting off?
---
Again, survivors are forgoing using a sprint perk for Head On - so what if you eat a 3-second stun a survivor was stupid enough to just waste at the beginning of a chase, if in turn you don't have to worry about any of the other Exhaustion perks?
---
On top of that, there's counterplay. If you try to use the perk mid-chase, you risk getting hit or grabbed, jumping into the locker. The killer can try to bait out the locker jump, going in and out of range, and grabbing you out of the locker if you don't jump. This is especially true because Head On, like Dead Hard, is vulnerable to latency, and thus favours killers. It also seems that in order to get the stun, the "exit locker" animation has to have fully played out - this potentially allows killers to hit or grab survivors before the animation is through. Enduring might also affect the stun timer.
---
In either case, the perk currently is a gimmick. It is supposed to be used instead of a sprint perk - it should be strong. Why are people so afraid of strong perks? We've been using mostly the same two handfuls of perks for years now, because they are strong, whereas most of the new perks so very much are not. It's beyond stale. I want more strong perks, I want a more diverse and fun and interesting metagame that makes for more varied gameplay with new and engaging interactions. You don't get that with meme-tier gimmick perks like Head On in its current form. A few weeks into Chapter release, it will vanish off the face of regular play, like most perks.

I agree. A way of telling when she’s phasing would make the playing field more fair. And yes I would definitely take billy boi and nurse over her. Thanks for replying
---
Trapper and Myers are generally the most wholesome in my experience. When I play either of those two I prefer to be so and deliberate over the game with the survivors post game. In the event of some victories I've been insulted, told to kill myself, and you can imagine what else sore losers might say, but that's surprisingly only about 30% of the time. The rest of the time they're either passive aggressive and I don't get ggs or they actually talk to me. 
---
Wait until you find somebody who sits at a pallet and just hope gets you luck. 
---
I did it with tinkerer though. Was fortunate enough to find someone not paying attention for the sound of my blink. 
---
Exactly, so you'll get people who've played for 1000 hours regularly going up against those who've only played for 100.
---
A lot of upset survivors in the comments... As someone who plays mostly survivor, I have already been puked on for no reason. Initially, I went into more-uptight-than-a-butthole, "tHis Is BM oH my GoD" mode, until I realized how funny the situation was. Regardless of whether you were doing this in a trolling manner or not, it's still hilarious. People need to lighten up and let themselves be showered in comedic vomit, goddamnit!
---
I think moto moto likes you
---
Sorry to busy your bubble bud, but I doubt that's going to happen, we're stuck with legion, just like we're stuck with Mike
---
It's a reward for completing your main objective and its effect is really mild compared to killer's alternative. You get 1 chase reset (if you aren't on hook or in killer's grasp or dead) compared to a 4K potential killer has with most late game perks.
---
Adrenaline is a late game perk, by taking it you are assuming that all 5 gens are going to get popped which isn't nearly as often if the killer is good. You want to counter adrenaline? Do your main objective as killer and learn how to apply map pressure properly/learn how to do chases properly. Just like with Noed, it will be completely useless if you never get to late game.
---
Is that a jojo reference 
---
I think white knight killers who pretend to be ok with the bs in the game are the worst. Cringe fest.
---
That was intense!
---
But... those perks at those ranks?
---
No problem, I didn't get offended
---
Just that it's "easy" or "low effort" doesn't mean we can't appreciate it, right? We also can't compare the high quality of other cosplays with someone else's, who might be less experienced.
---
OP just wanted to show something that they are proud of. So let's not throw negative comments their way. "We've already seen this." "There is only a piece of cardboard and a hoodie." This is still a work in progress and something new they are making/have made. 
---
Honestly, I know this community is salty by standard, but sometimes if you've got nothing nice to say just scroll by and leave it alone. It can't hurt you...
---
Oh yeah, my fault. I forgot about that achievement. 
---
Fuck that achievement. Took me like 13 games AFTER I figured out what it meant. 
---
You’d think BHVR would’ve learned by now to not make ridiculous achievements like that. 
---
Legion was pretty balanced. /s for the retarded.
---
Stay tuned on next episode!
---
4th one is bald pizza dwight or christmas dwight for me m8 dangerous lad
---
A comment that gets attention and even a response is infact a valid comment. Nothing you can do about that sadly. gg
---
"Usually don't use it" yes because it removes all fun from the chase and is completely unfair. Also most people will DC vs it so they actually want to have a match.
---
Yeah go watch Zubat play Nurse and come back and tell me that Nurse is fine as she is. Arguing that a bad nurse isn't that good doesn't do anything as an argument. You can argue that with everything! Everything has a potential to be bad if its used by a potato player! It proves exactly nothing.
---
&gt;Nerfed ones are ok, you can get tunneled of the hook even without Mori, so what's your point?
---
Well I don't know, maybe that you don't get another hook and another chase and another potential to be saved? You are cutting the whole game in half for the survivors. That's why it's not fair.
---
Okay so I'm gonna try to give you an unbiased answer, since everyone else gave you very biased ones lol.
---
Stereotypes/Stigmas:
---
\-Nurse is God Tier
---
\-Nurse, Hillbilly, Huntress, and Spirit are some of the best killers in the game (Huntress is subjective at times, though)
---
\-Wraiths and Leatherfaces are known for camping (mainly Leatherfaces)
---
\-Pig is cute
---
\-Legion and Freddy are the worst killers
---
\-Freddy has needed buffs since his release
---
\-Most of the community view doctor and wraith as low tier killers
---
\-Most feel the hag, pig, and michael myers are mid tier
---
\-I've seen a few people express that clown is garbage, while others say he's higher tier with a high skill ceiling
---
\-Huntress seems to be the communities fav killer cuz she's thick and "motherly" I guess
---
My biased stereotypes, from personal experiences include:
---
\-9/10 Leatherfaces are pricks and yes, they love hard-camping, it's my least favorite killer in the game
---
\-Clowns tend to soft camp rather than hard camp, they love to tunnel, and are generally douchebags
---
\-Spirits are often played by skilled killers, but their play styles often come off as arrogant and douchey to me
---
\-Huntresses DC the most
---
\-Hag is higher tier
---
\-Nurse is OP
---
I never claimed to say he was OP when he came out. And yes his weaknesses can be countered, no chase potential, you can mind game, since Freddy doesn't need a lot of tracking or disruption perks you can almost solely focus on chase perks. The 7 sec transition, yes this is an issue late game, so delay the game long enough so the game doesn't reach that stage. 
---
If Survivor was so easy, killers would not be averaging more than 2 Kills/Game across basically all maps.  In most cases, people who claim Killers have it too hard are those who do not consider 2 Kills to have been a good game think Killers should average 3-4 Kills/Game
---
i never knew i wanted something so bad....
---
Some changes happen faster than others :) until it’s changed I’ll keep playing swf so it’s all good 
---
r/CursedImages
---
&gt;Good survivors will do gens anyway
---
Then you are failing your objective and they are getting rewarded for doing theirs properly. Plus it's still not true, you can beat good survivors even without playing top tier killers. It's just dependant on your skill level.
---
DS is getting reworked into uselessness so it's not really a problem anymore.
---
Crutch? So it's used cheating to make your mistakes go away as survivor? But you just mentioned that good survivors use it?
---
It's as much of a crutch as remember me or Noed. If you are playing well it's effects are neglible and complaining about it is honestly silly.
---

---
I was **Hope** this would be a **Windows of Opportunity** for me to see the  r/puninternalaffairs's office xD
---
I love the piggy gal! =D
---
I mean here’s a picture: you are in the middle of a match and you have to go to work, have plans with friends, or you received some bad news. Imagine not being able to exit the game, so you leave your controller on the ground, your teammates reporting you for being afk.
---
Not to argue your point or anything, but Pill Bottle has no drawbacks as well. And everyone is OK with having it (at least while Freddy is in his current state). 
---
I still don't get people getting angry at bei g slugged. Okey, maybe it's because I sometimes run No Mither, Unbreakable and/pr tenacity but I am always glad when I see someone slug. It also makes me happy to see that the killer is actually thinking. I like to feel like I'm playing against people and if the killer just chases, hooks and repeats, I feel like I might as well be fighting an AI
---
She's a priestess, not a godess though. So I suppose first panel should contain Pope instead of Jesus. 
---
Dust out your ps4.
---
I can guarantee that's half the issue.
---
TBF they can report you for leaving early too. That said, removing the option to leave is a bad idea. 
---
Finally, the killer buff we have been needing! Take the shoes of dead Megs to run faster!
---
As a killer main, you're an embarrassment to the rest of us. 
---
So good riddance. Don't let the door hit you on your way out. 
---
&gt; As a solo survivor I'm having issues following what people are complaining about, the counter is their and very straight forward and in majority of games survivors spawn next to a totem and clear them.
---
There is no counter for totems, and how often do randoms really cleanse totems in your solo games?
---
Me playing killer doesn't stop me from aknowledging that some of the things killers have are overly strong and deserve adjustments.
---
If you think a character that can moonwalk you with no interaction is fair then good for you. I certainly don't.
---
I'm not saying they are overpowered, something can be broken because it breaks the rules of the game/is terribly designed.
---
Again, they could just Control, Alt, Delete their way out of the match. Removing the button wouldn’t affect bad players dcing.
---
just let the salt feed you duh. i always giggle a lot when i see that someone took the time to message me because they died
---
The Pip System is stupid as shit right now; they expect you to give free gens, expect people to not DC/kill themself on hook and basically punishes you for people being assholes as Killer.
---
And as Survivor you depip if your team's stupid, doing two and a half gens, saving four people and looping the Killer for a solid two minutes before they left me.
---
Like, yeah, make High Ranks harder to achieve. Just not the damn Olympus of Ranking.
---
If you play and change up your perks and killers enough you will get better. 
---
You probably are making small mistakes (like missing immersed survivors or not optimally picking chases) that are adding up. When you shave off a few seconds from every hit, chase, and patrol it really adds up.
---
When you get good enough you start to get used SWFs being overly altruistic and you can punish them hard.
---
Frequently change up who you play and what perks you use and you'll pick up things that improve you with every killer.
---
Yes, I know.
---
But SOMETIMES I think it would be at least a little more effort to leave the game, some people wouldn’t.    It’d get annoying after a while to keep reloading up the game 
---
However if it’s a true emergency it doesn’t matter as you will not reload the game, you really leave.
---
It’s not going to fix it, but I think it will help or at least slightly annoy dcers 
---
Also, more annoying for consoles, so even more of a deterrent from dcers 
---
Yes but then there's more input lag because you wouldn't be connected to the same network as your PS4. 
---
Imagine stunning the Killer and Sprint Bursting away, that's why it's an exhaust
---
You're doing gods work OP
---
I ranted about this the other day and some of ya were saying it's fine. How is 5 Gen, 4K, No Pip is a good thing?
---
It's so you can't combo it with others for a free stun then Sprint burst away 
---
Why didn’t you just make the text white? 
---
I’ll be the roundabout!
---
So because you can possibly miss it then that makes it fair? Well then I'll argue that current DS is fair, the survivor can miss it and you can jiggle around to make it harder for them to hit it.
---
Go ask him if he thinks nurse is fair.
---
&gt;If the Killer wants to tunnel you till you die you won't get another chase anyway
---
Yes but you know what's the difference there? You get to play it out. Maybe you will get out, maybe your teammates will save you, maybe the killer misplays it. Mori removes all of that, it removes you from the game after a single hook.
---
It might suprise you, but the survivor is there to survive and just like the killer trying to kill them they deserve a fair chance at that. Mori takes it away.
---
You seriously think that it being a 4v1 equals everything out? That none of it is too strong? That's ridiculous.
---
Survivors hate legion because he breaks all the chase mechanics in the game and forces you to a "m1 simulator" where you only mend or do gens
---
Killers hate legion because he is shit tier without franks mixtape and OP with it. And it's not fun to use a killer that has pre-determined chases (you hit someone twice, moonwalk them for 10 secs, and hit them again). 
---
What's the reference? I didn't get it 
---
How long does the stun last? Cause if its like 3 sec you can just permastun the killer by jumping in and out of the locker every three seconds ig theres no cd.
---
I only enjoy playing this game with my friends for this reason. It's so rare to find a good random survivor who won't flame the shit of you for a minor mistake while having such a long chase.
---
Oh but wait, killers even dodge 2 man swf.
---
Yeah this game is unenjoyable only because of the community. 
---
Oh, I definitely agree with you on that one, I was only speaking for killers. But for survivors it definitely need to be some changes done for the ranking up system yeah. 
---
Lol you're getting down voted for speaking the truth. 
---
Yea mine starts roaring but rarely crashes
---
True, true. IT TOOK ME 6 MINUTES TO BE ABLE TO SAY THIS.
---
What's poor about their English? It's just not their mother's tongue, do you not understand them? O.o

---
I remember my very first game as Legion, some guy DC on me the moment he saw me and messaged me saying "No Thanks"
---
The only messages I've gotten as Michael have been from angry kids because I've killed him first.
---
Legion has no counter as survivor unless you're a master at sandbagging, but he is VERY fun to play as.
---
FBI Wants to Know Your Location
---
I did it during an event when people were farming and it was super easy.
---
At first the context is intended to be purely innocent as I wanted to draw Jane as a 'mom' figure comforting Dwight. But halfway drawing I just.... well what the hell lol
---
&gt;Then you are failing your objective and they are getting rewarded for doing theirs properly.
---
Implying that if you are playing optimally as killer survivors will never ever complete 5 gens, don't be funny mate. BTW, you know that there's such thing as "endgame build", right?
---
&gt;Plus it's not true that you need to play top killers, you can beat good survivors even without playing top tier killers.
---
I didn't meant that you can't beat good survivors as non-top killers. They just have much less potential to stop them, so they will get genrushed very often.
---
&gt;DS is getting reworked into uselessness so it's not really a problem anymore.
---
Not into uselessness, but more specific target. It's anti-tunneling perk now, and it's very good idea. Right now DS is straight up broken.
---
&gt;If they play better than you then they deserve to be rewarded for it.
---
Sure, it's good to reward skillful players. The problem is that it will reward all others aswell.
---
&gt;Crutch? So it's used cheating to make you mistakes go away as survivor? But you just mentioned that good survivors use it?
---
One more time: it gives you free heal and better Sprint Burst. If you are playing against Freddy then he is double fucked, because before he can chase you again he has to wait 7 goddamn seconds to even start the chase. Before you will catch up and put you to sleep others will probably already open the exit gates. 3 very good effects just because your team repaired 5 gens, you don even have to touch one. You can hide in a locker whole game, and you will still get your Adrenaline. Of course good survivors use it, because it's great perk with no downsides. Why wouldn't they? In my region (EU) 80% of survivors in Rank 1 use it. There's no game without Adrenaline.
---
&gt;It's half as strong as remember me or Noed. If you are playing well it's effects are neglible and complaining about it is honestly silly.
---
NOED can be deactivated before it even activates, and Remember Me requires to tunnel one single survivor till he is dead. Others can easilly repair gens before that happens if obsession knows what he's doing. Besides that, noone actually runs it. Adrenaline has no counter. Sure, you can kill survivor using it before 5 gens pop, but it's not a counter. Just luck.
---
&gt;Why is the perk being strong automatically making it a crutch? Do you consider balanced landing or dead hard or unbreakable crutches as well?
---
Just like I've said before. And no, I don't. Those are all examples of strong perks that aren't broken, I'm completly fine with them.

It's a perk that does nothing all game, has numerous ways to ensure it doesn't do anything, and may not result in anything even if it activates. It's fine how it is.
---
What a precious little miguel...
---
Entity be like: "hold up, no.... we have the wrong Elanor Shellstrop here, brb"
---
You're asking us to react only positively to something overdone. If someone posted a meme for the 5000th time, it would lose its weight too. This really is no different
---
Um purpose of this post?
---
HAHAHAHAHA NICE
---
I agree that it would be better if there was legitimate counterplay, but I'd rather take it with a downside that can be mitigated, as well as being more costly and rare, than for it to be a purple with 0 counterplay
---
This is a crime punishable by tunneling
---
If you saved your sprint burst and went in a locker why not? I mean you could just sprint burst away anyway?
---
Go log onto your main account and talk trash. I dare you
---
Agreed this perk is meme level trash right now. It could be a fun and risky perk if they got ris of the waiting and exhaustion. Just give it a cooldown after use
---
gotta equip it when everyones running flashlight
---
I think this works pretty well for these two characters and is super cutea
---
Lmao what a little baby
---
Oh boy yeah, what a counter, just take twice as long to do any gens!
---

The new pip system could be good if they tweak the scoring in the emblem system. Some friends and I did some testing and with 4 rank 1 survivors the best we did was have 2 of us pip 1 safety and 1 depip. Killer pretty much had to tunnel a survivor for 2 hooks and then move to the next survivor to gain their pip. Plus this system makes deranking hella easy and now rewards the deranker with blood points. 
---
Approximately 2014
---
This looks like a good list to me (besides Clown who, IMO, either belongs at the top or bottom)!
---
Especially Mandy's tier; a nice date with her would probably end with some kind of 'test'.
---
Wtf just happened 
---
More wait that’s the law
---
Looked at some of your other work too. Good job!
---
Frim my perspective there are going to be more games where the killer is really good to hunt down survivors since they will be lower rank
---
So you are one of those “Friendly Killers” who wants to hold hands and cuddle?
---
I was banned for griefing once on PC. it happens
---
This is my main account. You act like im scared of you or public opinion
---
“Pity Slug” sounds like the name of an indie band.  Or Danger Mouse’s more pitiable cousin.
---
It’s fine if you’re in a SWF. Not if you’re solo surviving. It’s the most crutch perk in the game for bad players 
---
Yep:)
---
What if I told you that it's not bait? 
---
I played a game where the obsession Jake kept instasaving with this hag we were up against. Never let himself get healed he would just instasave. 
---
In her defense, the hag never actually tunneled and never went back. I guess she felt bad about the saves tbh. Her traps were really good too. 
---
Cue me, the Dwight with no Urban Immersion, sneaking around coldwind to the hatch. 
---
From my perspective there are going to be more games where the killer is really good to hunt down survivors since they will be lower rank. Basically the killer that used to play against red ranks will play against green or beige ranks.
---
Im convinced at this point though that DS basically is a second chance perk
---
*You would like that wouldn't you*
---
Sad that almost all the camper/tunnellers got 4ks
---
i bought myc from the shrine. ds too
---
You do you - I don’t give a fuck. If I meet you as a survivor I don’t farm with you. If I meet you as a killer I will fuck you up.
---
Exactly what Top comment said, Buy a pressured air can and problemo solved
---
Mentally, debatable. Barely any killer is collected mentally
---
Have you never played a competitive game? I cant think of a single successful competitive game that didnt allow a player to leave a match. Yeah there were punishments, but it is still ALWAYS an option.
---
Exactly! It's very frustrating 😥
---
Sureee;)
---
Center button &gt; close software then. My word some of you are braindead.
---
But calling her Mandy is okay too right?
---
nah
---
Good we have understanding. Fuck off then kiddo
---
The first time I have ever seen freddy on top of a list
---
It's not that hard to cleanse totems or remember where some easy to cleanse ones are. I can't remember the last time I got hit by NOED. Also running a perk doesn't make you a good or bad player.
---
You can in the settings, I am sure I lowered chat volume anyway. Will check when I’m next using it. 
---
It's my favourite bug in the game tbh.
---
Don't tunnel and it will be okay.
---
I would like to call 911
---
I don't know why this isn't talked about more. It's way more of a problem than noed. 
---
I see what you did there. But trust me when you wake up you will be tested.
---
Yeah the perk is awfully situational and it also requires a 3 second prep time. 
---
Just give it a timer like quick and quiet.
---
Let's be honest dribbling was an exploit
---
I’ll be sure to bend you over and d strike your butthole
---
No, it really wouldn't. It takes 3 seconds for it proc so you can't really use it in a chase without getting pulled out of the locker.
---
A day old, exclusively basing your name on your view of reddit's survivor side of things. Yeah, no. Come back when you're less full of shit &lt;3
---
The words will make you out and out,
---
Hmmmm.......ok? I'm saying about the probability being manipulated by the devs, i'm not saying It is impossible to get it in the shrine, but Now: think about the times MYC appeared in the shrine, and compare It with lightborn, the third Seal or any other bad-medium One. Those bad-medium perks appeared MUCH more (seriously, empathy appeared 12 times in the shrine..12..territorial imperative appeared 9 fucking times in It, and is a totally shit perk (imo), while that:perks like iron Maiden doesn't appeared AT ALL. This can't me a coincidence..maybe the bad perks have a higher chance..
---
Why os this tagged as Spoiler?
---
You met a legit edgy teenager hes gonna send you mean messages and vauge threats but wont actually do anything
---
I mean instead of getting into the locker and waiting for the killer to close the distance and potentially try to bait out the stun you could have sprint bursted earlier and gained a MASSIVE distance advantage over the killer.
---
Not sure why all the downvotes, you're exactly right.
---
Cute try .. almost made me chuckle 
---
If its his opinion, dont hate him, but you should do this a NSFW post... people are getting crazy lmao
---
Meh, I've never had a problem with DS. If they were a shitty survivor, they often ran to where there were no pallets and I caught them again in less than 10 seconds. If they were good and knew how to loop, I just ignored them and obliterated their team, saving them for last.
---
The good ones often got wrapped up in trying to get my attention, wasting most of their time following me around instead of doing gens. The change now just forces killers to either play inefficiently or run Enduring. 
---
I can just swap out a perk on any killer build and fit Enduring in, nothing changes for me, If you're the weak link on your team, I'm still gonna tunnel you.
---
It doesn't slow down the progress too much; it adds maybe 10 seconds on the gen, and its much better to take a hit than get grabbed. Using gen tapping as a counter to the beads leaves her with a very narrow window to grab, and more often than not she doesn't get the grab and ends up chasing you. Spirit players who rely on beads to snatch people are usually not as good at chases making them easier to juke. It's worked for me plenty of times, and beats prayer beads "snatcher build" spirits more often than not because if she doesn't chase, you go heal and get back at tapping gens, if she does chase, you buy time for your allies to do the gens without worrying about getting grabbed. It may not be the most ideal counter to it, but it is a counter that works. Otherwise you are left with scanning around for moving grass and jumping off the gen the moment you notice it, but that's not possible on maps like Lery's, The Game, or any place with gens that have no grass nearby. 
---
UwU you ain’t gonna be sayin that when it happens, Feng is ur daddy now UwU
---
This is one I haven’t gotten yet- and you’re right. Every time I’ve gotten close, the last person disconnects. 
---
On NOED wasting survivors' time because it might be there: stuff like that is a part of the risk of this game. With that logic, you could say BBQ and other perks like it are badly designed, because BBQ forces survivors to hide pre-hook in order to not get seen (or just use the run in one direction fake-out trick). Stuff being a risk does not mean a bad design. Survivors are just lazy.
---
And bank on getting lucky that she doesn't get a grab anyway.
---
4 survivors would have to be Claudette, Meg,Dwight,David. 
---
Just to balance it out otherwise swap David for Meg, however this then becomes a Femdom porno.
---
gachiBASS
---
Damn good meme
---
She's mid tier but REALLY fun. Her perks are Dark Devotion: shit, Infectious Fright: decent, Corrupt Intervention: great as long as you can get momentum going while it's active.
---
People sometimes have other things to do. We have lives outside of this game. 
---
Besides, removing this option won't do anything. I can just run Ctrl+Alt+Delete and dump via Task Manager. 
---
What does swf mean?
---
Paint god here.

Omg thank you!!! I can't understand half of these memes

Yes.

dude bless you, seriously 
---
Hit them and force them to leave simple
---
You sounded like Goofy in this video I love it.
---
hahaha no worries! it took me a long time to understand a lot of the memes and abbreviations, if you ever don’t know just ask :)
---
Tunneling with Dying Light against the new DS is really bad for DL. If you get struck by it, DL deactivates.
---
It's worse than sprint bursting early and getting more distance, which was the first half of my post you seem to have ignored in your reply.
---
You are taking a worst option out of the two and actually putting yourself at a disadvantage compared to running away early. I don't really see anything bad about it. It's mildly annoying but the killer benefits from it.
---
It's like pallet blinding, you are mildly inconveniencing the killer while putting yourself at a disadvantage. The blind runs out by the time the killer is finished kicking the pallet and can move again, at which point they look up and the blind can't be extended. You would make more distance by just running away. The killer benefits in the end. I don't see a problem.
---
Colonel...
---
Like when you see that Huntress Thiccness and its too much?
---
So .. this means you don’t know how to say no to your friends 
---
Not free anymore. If the 60 seconds are up or the killer doesn't tunnel, it's a dead perk. The killer can literally never see DS ever again if they play their cards right.
---
There is a name for this sort of fetish, can't recall though.
---
Oi
---
Tru3 went from rank 1 to rank 5 in PTB. Do you think its fine?
---
I mean, Im all-in to make it harder to pip, but this is absurd.
---
Pretty sure me closing the game means **no.**
---
Source?
---
one of the beds also has a dead cow in it
---
You don’t need to 4k for the adept achievement. You need a 4k OR a 2 pip. 
---
I don’t know what perks you have but I was able to do it with ruin I, whispers III, BBQ I, and then another intel perk. I think it was spies. 
---
Slug the third dude, you have four minutes to find and hook the last guy. 
---
How?
---
With this I'd suggest using Blood All-Seeing. You'll be able to find both the Slugged person and the Healthy person by searching the map while cloaked.
---
Do you remember the killers name?
---
Was it SwoleBenji or Hi5ToTheFace?
---
This happened to me recently. ;_;
---
Yep. I was talking about the old one--still technically in use because I opted out of the PTB. 
---
And therefore us killers can enjoy the full benefits of our Obsession perks. 
---
&gt; OR a 2 pip.
---
That's not true. Merciless Killer does not get the adept achievement 
---
Chad enough to just stride right over it. 
---
Audio has been further broken on ptb, as far as I can tell.  Pretty much par for the course when patch notes include "engine update" 
---
The legion bullshit achievement is much worse. 
---
The spirit also did not kill anyone. 
---
I also just realized I had the dumbest comment of this entire sub so I had to delete it. 
---
That is not what you should’ve picked out. Lmao. 
---
I'm not saying it's not a Get Out Of Jail Free Card, it is, and that is a problem. However, it wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem if ruin wasn't as common because hitting tiny skillchecks is hard until you practice with them a lot.
---
Can confirm hit boxes for Head On are busted. They don't even have to touch you, the shockwave of Janes ass clapping as she sprints out the locker is intense enough to stun from a distance.
---
I see your argument, and I raise you one: "Basement has lockers right in front of the stairs".
---
Oh yeah, I forgot, I'm an idiot
---
Not like vaulting at a higher speed does anything if the window is open. 
---
Basement says hello.
---
Bug is just another word for imminent feature. 
---
That super Mario jump at the end was hilarious 
---
I addressed your point in my first 11 words. The point is NOT IT"S CHASE VIABILITY, BUT IT'S TOXICITY POTENTIAL that I am referring to. You CAN run immediately but some would stay in a near locker, get the stun and then run to god knows where before a killer can even start to go after them. I for example have got several stuns on the new map in the temple by hiding in the lockers in the basement and stunning a killer as they walk past to kick the gen and to add a sprint to it so the killer has no chance to really try to go after me would be risk free toxicity.
---
Sounds familiar, but after looking through recent players I don't see them. Maybe it's too far back?
---
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that DS skill check is at least two or three times the size of a great skill check
---
Slug the second to last survivor
---
This is only partly true.  While the generally accepted "lagswitch" is something that only works on killers, Survivors can (or at least could, eac may detect now) use connection manipulation for a variety of effects, including teleporting back to last touched interactable mid-chase, moving past exit gates, and preventing the killer from being able to hook them (which is also or was also doable with a standard "lagswitch" if timed properly). 
---
I think it would cool to see as an anthology like in the vein of creepshow so that way we can get brief glimpses into lore of the chapters. 
---
Well, you know. 3s stun that start at the beginning of you exiting the locker (0.5s animation), it aint really powerful. Using lithe+DWM is something powerful. But this isnt THAT powerful, and having the possibility to use an exhaust after could be nice. But i’m ok with the perk as it is.
---
Fuck, that is so hot
---
You honestly think deliverance is harder to achieve than evil incarnate? Lol......
---
Okay.  There's nothing else to be said I guess.  You must have a respectable region. My survivors DC literally almost every game. Lucky you.
---
At rank one, nobody on my team disconnects and we actually have a fun game. Imagine that?
---
Spread out, do gens, stealth when he’s around, and make the most of your injury sprint bursts.
---
He’s not some almighty God of Bullshit that’s guaranteed a 4K. Only broken thing about him is Frank’s Mixtape, which will definitely get tweaked, and most Legions can’t stand to even use it.
---
If he’s camping or tunneling, that’s a whole separate issue. Nobody tunnels more than the common Spirit, but there’s no rallies to remove her from the game.
---
All the crybabies just can’t believe a killer can fast vault. Big deal.
---
is it a language that exists?
---
Reverse OoO that only works in terror radius
---
Bruh that was the most clutch escape I've ever seen
---
I dislike playing against legions, stop trying to make me feel bad for leaving the match. 
---
It works Both ways lol 
---
Getting 5 totems on your own is not that easy dude.
---
Ive been rank 1 for the past two weeks playing consistantly and almost never had toxic survivor/killer in post game chat
---
I’m not saying it’s harder. 
---
I’m saying it’s more grindy and annoying. 
---
Most people get EI in 10 games max. 
---
Generally speaking you shouldn't start games you're not prepared to finish.  Just saying.
---
This. Survivors don't like stuff that impedes them from banging out gens ASAP, when that's what killers have been asking for for quite a while now and that would be good for the game.
---
That would be cool
---
You cant even imagine how thankfull I am for your help! thank you so much! You already made my life as a killer much easier, and ill make sure to study the videos you linked! Thanks again!
---
I like that idea
---
He's fine not even gonna go down
---
What if they changed it so it was reversed? You cant hear it if she's outside of your terror radius, but you CAN if she's INSIDE it. It won't really stop the grabs off gens if she builds around it, but during chases she can't mind game + it's easier to deal with as a survivor.
---
I fookin love that dwight skin
---
More like the brighter the clothes, the more toxic the nea is
---
Who cares? It hurts them more to have to bend and then heal on top of that. 
---
Oh god, i'm talking about the frequency, i'm not saying It is impossible, okay? See the times a good perk like ruin was in the shrine:Only a few right? Now think about a bad perk like territorial from huntress:The chances are unbalanced. 
---
Easiest to farm with with traps 
---
Yea it would definitely work better as a series than a movie. Because you’re right, they already have very intriguing lore, if they could just build off of that I’m sure a series would be a hit. Plus with a series I think they could go more in depth with how the killer(s) came to be.
---
"Cucumbers taste better pickled".
---
"Immortal" - too many "buts" in the first paragraph.
---
He's bloody gorgeous
---
Also imagine being stunned for 3 seconds, catching the Sprinter up again to a locker and they would stun you for 3 more seconds. It wouldn't be the smartest move to go in another locker but as a killer I would be done with the match with a long chase on top of 6 seconds of stuns (this does not include pallets, window loops and even more lockers) 
---
New killer looks incredible.  I can't wait to add her into my rotation.  She looks so much fun and quite strong.
---
But you can literally grab someone before the stun, so it wouldn't work.
---
I just tombstoned

"Group who ain't save me"
---
Thats more of a nitpick from me but thats not proper London.
---
The killer power seems way too op. Camoflauge is a way top op perk.
---
She's not hot, just thicc, which apparently this sub loves.
---
So instead of fixing the problem with intentionally depipping, we're going to have more highly skilled killers dunking on less skilled players through no fault of their own? That's, uh, not ideal. 
---
Yeah legion is an answer to swf in a way. All his perks punish teamwork and slow the game down even body blocking hooks lol I think ppl just need to realize how he plays and work around it
---
It's clearly bait as it's impossible for Michael 'Hunk' Myers to spark joy in your pants
---
I think Head On causes Exhaustion because Behavior is far too scared of creating a second Decisive Strike.
---
Same, unless they do something stupid with my charity - like try to open a chest right behind me two seconds after I start pursuit of the unhooker
---
I half disagree with you. I don't think the problem with Legion is that they slow the game down, but HOW they slow the game down. Being able to destroy the fun of any chase by M1ing multiple people with ease is awfully boring on the receiving end.
---
Look at a killer like the pig and how she can slow the game down by using her traps. Now I get it if you think holding M1 to mend and holding M1 on the right box isn't much different, but it feels a lot more involved.
---
I disagree with OP about removing Legion from the game unless they plan on giving people who purchased Legion compensation, but I do agree that Legion is bad for the game in their current state.
---
There is no tactical use of the power and it seems a bit ridiculous for a survivor to be instantly exposed when they are in a chase.
---
That's hilarious!
---
Thank you for doing this. Will you be doing 3d renders of the new leaked skins?
---
So just get stunned 20 times and still have no idea someone is right there, also, play without sound, right?
---
Double BP?
---
not comparing, just linking a connection 
---
It’s just really annoying to get tunneled by a pig since it is an even worse play than usual if she trapped you
---
we just gonna ignore how rare it is for newish players to consistently hit DS
---
Head on and then lithe. No thank you.
---
What is this song? I see it everywhere and I love it!
---
It's not as simple as that sounds, as balance of everything would be affected.
---
Top tier characters like Nurse, spirit and billy would need to get nerfed because the game got slowed down to help killers that are low tier because of their lack of map pressure. Ruin and other game delaying perks would require adjustments and potential changes to make up for a slowed down game.
---
Yeah but why should teamwork ever be discouraged? Regardless of power teamwork should be the focus of survivors so they can get out.
---
Where did you get that stat? Lol.....  you're just being nonsensical for a no argument type situation. Maybe you're trying to sharpen your ability for debate.
---
You personally might find it annoying or grindy.  From an objective perspective there is no debate that evil incarnate is more difficult to get.... that's all I'm saying and there's nothing really to debate there.  Just getting off point....
---
I'm pretty sure Dwight is power bottom twink though. Just check out the way he handles that flashlight.
---
I usually have trouble communicating to that last surviving dude that I'm letting them go.  I'll pick them up and even if I'm walking in a direction that's obviously hook-free, they'll still wiggle out and run away.  I usually have to pin them in a situation where it's very, *very* obvious that I could just swat them if I wanted to, and then stand there motionless for a minute while that sinks in; and then they get the picture that I'm cool with them escaping.
---
Can confirm.
---
I believe if the doctor is in treatment mode then it will apply madness around survivors in the obsessions terror radius. If perk effects apply in the terror radius then I guess the same properties would apply.
---
Road to p3 piggy, I love playing her but it hurts when I get the camping tunneling noed pigs when I play surv

You can boop my snoot any time :)
---
r/Don'tDeadOpenInside
---
Or lightborn 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I've been thinking this for awhile, but I've never stopped during a chase to watch a killer jump out the window to see the animation.
---
you can report but the actual punishment will be handled by the system 
---
Honest question, does it seem like the hit box for getting caught in traps is too small? I've seen people weave past them mid chase at a pallet. Would being able to set them closer to walls or closer together help? It feels like his traps need something to help them out but I'm not sure what. Tar bottle on by default perhaps?
---
Hey - that's me!
---
Glad someone made it. lol
---
That's the price you pay.  As a parallel example, if you're someone who can't use Dead Hard worth beans, or figure out how to use it in high ping, or judge distances or timings, then it'll be a waste to use.
---
I still say Head On is worth it on its own because it's already proven to have a couple scenarios in the PTB where it was useful (and game-saving) even when it was suspected both by, and as, the killer.  However if it loses its exhaustion limitation, it becomes too powerful as to be imbalanced by way of drastically altering chase routes - particularly against SWFs.
---

---
Nurse does “ Shotgun noise”away from you! 
---
Save some for clown and Santa cosmetic
---
They changed it down to 20 in console now?
---
True, but I think that’s more down to the huge amount of survivors seeing totems as pointless or a waste of time. It surprises me how many people will walk right past them when they aren’t even in much of a hurry to go anywhere. I take quick detours around structures that I pass to check for totems and I still manage to get generators done, heal teammates, etc... Granted, it’s a bit boring and not worth many bloodpoints but it doesn’t take long at all. I really don’t understand why the majority of survivors flat-out ignore totems.
---
This clips tells me something has changed with the hitbox. I've been "sucked" in to traps from greater distances. ofc this could be latency, but I feel like I could never get this close without being trapped.
---
If you use it every game for like a day then you’ll get used to it...
---
Yeah. It was pretty close.
---
There shouldn't be final survivor. The end goal should be to get out of the Entity realm with as many survivors as possible. 
---
I do believe that having people DC in a match should do more to reward both the killer and survivor in bp gain and maybe help against deranking. 
---
Maybe provide the killer with the full bp gain of hooking and killing a survivor when they DC instead of a small bp gain. 
---
For survivors, possibly provide them with a large BP and maybe increase the normal bp rewards throughout the match as the game is made to be much harder.
---
The DC punishing though can be debatable as there are times where disconnection may be needed. You got situations where players may have to leave for something important or a killer/survivor is holding the game hostage. Imagine being a killer and its been 20 minutes and the last survivor has just been hiding from you at full health and there is not hatch. 
---
DC at the start of the match though without doing much should be punishable though.
---
I feel like a lot of times killers that slug are thirsty af. Either they get someone down and see another injured person nearby, and want to secure 2 hooks, or it’s a toxic nurse or billy with deer stalker who just slugs at 5 gens with ruin still up because they’re soooo thirsty for a 4K
---
Or if it's an unsafe basement unhook and you get in the locker and when the killer goes to open, then bam
---
So sensitive.
---
Good. I think she is fine rn. 
---
They're not going to ban people for DCing. That'd be stupid. Just suck it up and deal with it. 
---
Toxicity creates toxicity. If you do that and mess up and the Killer facecamps you when your friends are still trying to save you, don't complain.
---
I always forget about how weird Unbreakable looks on console.
---
exactly, being a toxic ass is a two way street 
---
As long as Elizabeth Warren in Native American headdress is included. I'd also accept breadline Bernie too. 
---
no but currently the chaser emblem is bugged. It's always 0 whatever happened. Maybe their new system will work if it's not bugged.
---
This isn't Missed Connections on Craigslist. 
---
If you hug the wall you will not move in the other direction. You can press A and stick to the wall no matter their wiggles.
---
But then why run a gimmicky perk when you can have a better perk? If you have high ping then use balanced landing, buffed light, sprint burst. All of them are much better exhaustion perks.
---
If the survivors are wasting time sitting in lockers instead of doing generators just for a short stun then the killer is benefitting overall. It is not going to be as powerful as you are trying to make it out to be at all.
---
Weird.
---
And if it wasn't an exhaustion perk then you could just stun loop the killer from locker to locker.
---
theyre just adjusting the parameters to more suit the power of the killer
---
You get a movement speed burst for the hit, you are moving much faster than he is.
---
Yeah now the sidebar appeared. I’m gonna mess around in it to see if I can fix it.
---
Ok. For some reason, a couple days ago, my sidebar disappeared along with the usernames of the survivors. It came back when the timer was at 5 seconds left.
---
Sure, won't engage any further. Have a good day, it looks like you need it.
---
A good looper can still easily cheese the cool down like the old exhaustion system.
---
I think one of the new perks like transfers your TR to a survivor, doesn't it? That would be an awesome game.. 
---
Bamboozled again Myers! Lol
---
yea ik it’s just sometimes you can still get hit and i’m speaking from personal experience, it just depends on what shit is in your way
---
I hope they lower the current dailies too :d

I can go on all the menus, but now I can’t switch characters or go on the menus. Someone I’m playing with forced me too get out of the game, so I can do no further exploring. :/ This was on PS4 by the way.
---
Hi mom!
---
I’d like to see the legion by itself as a killer, because tbh it’d be fair 
---
Sprint bursting away gives the killer a trail to follow and they'll catch up, if you could hide in a locker when you hear heart beat then maybe the chase doesn't even start at all or you could get a stun + speed boost and easily find a new place to hide.
---
Same here except everything stayed gone.
---
That's really strange. 
---
No regerts
---
Yeah.
---
Very appropriate use of the meme but I feel like the ace Ventura meme would have been just as good if not better 
---
Oof
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
And if you have quick and quiet it is definitely usable in a chase in some loops, if you break line of site at a pallet/window/locker loop then you could mind game the killer and easily get those 3 seconds before they realize you've gone into the locker.
---
Good one
---
The logs kinda look like corpses.. 
---
Pig main here. Keep spreading the good word 
---
It's because survivors are too altruistic and it helps camping killers, thus getting them more kills than they deserve, then they rank up, and blah blah blah you get it.
---
Thankfully, the new ranking system should combat this... with a few tweaks.
---
This is super exciting. Shame that you can submit several queries though. It might screw up the end result.
---
I honestly don't think I'll be doing it again. 
---
I know it's just a game but we're still people behind it, maybe if some kept that in mind this community wouldn't be so toxic. That said, I wholeheartedly agree with your last sentence.
---
Well, I can't say I respect your actions, but there's not much I can do about it, except ask that you don't. At least give your teammates a chance to save you, you know?  
---
You certainly won't be able to enjoy a match against a killer like Freddy if you don't try. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised if you try to change your mindset a little.  
---
"Maybe this match will be fun regardless," you could say to yourself, or even just "I might as well get as much BP out of this as I can."
---
Chapter XII leaked here on Reddit, folks
---
As we've seen before they have one hell of a team working with cgi like the clown trailer and the hallowen trailer as well, maybe they can get a few more animators and make it a thing
---
How so? Then you have to choose your second add on to either bring phasing moving speed back up, or use the purple sword to extend range. I’m not saying make both the case, just pick one. 
---
Your entire argument is that there’s no draw backs to using it. This would give a drawback that doesn’t ruin the add on lol
---
&gt;This is the exact way I play, this and skill check add-ons (Green Dress). It doesn't matter if it takes time, it's about winning. 
---
With class photo. Freddy is mid tier to highish tier. Thing is this is not an option you can always run. Its like running Freddy only with iridescent moris. You are not relying on the power of the killer to win **you are relying on the power of a very high tier addon.**
---
&gt;Yes OFC survivors wan wake up, but it isn't a big deal tbh, you just right click them again, this gives you a proc of class photo and you can go on. 
---
*You are not relying on the power of the killer to win you are relying on the power of a very high tier addon.*
---
If you are only playing with class photo. You have a warped view of Freddy. Freddy with common to uncommon addons is okish. A pretty low mid tier at best if you don't consider what other killers can accomplish with their common to uncommon addons. Thing is most other killers are good even without their addons. Leatherface has the worst pool of course but other killers have great addons at higher rarities. Saying that wraith is high tier due to running only rare and higher addons is a warped perception of their strength. Every killer will be elevated by running their best addons to much better tiers despite how crap or amazing they can be without these addons.
---
&gt;I constantly try and keep everyone asleep so this doesn't become a big issue. 
---
Let me guess. With class photo?
---
&gt;This I can agree on, at the end game it gets hard if no one is sleeping. But Freddy can stall the game long enough to where you don't reach this stage of the match. 
---
*Class Photo?*
---
Small suggestion. Try playing Freddy without any addons. Then try playing any other killer without addons as well. Then do the same for all the remaining. They do this again with only common to uncommon addons. You might just be surprised how crap Freddy is in comparison to all the others. Just so you have a good guideline for each killer's addons to run let me give you a breakdown.
---
* Trapper: Trapper Bag, Trapper's Gloves
---
* Hag: Dragonfly's Wings, Rope Necklace
---
* Cannibal: Primer Bulb, Vegetable Oil
---
* Doctor: Polished Electrode, Order - Class 1
---
* Hillbilly: Spiked Boots, Spark Plug
---
* Freddy: Green Dress/Nancy's Sketch, Sheep Block
---
* Shape: Dead Rabbit, Tacky Earrings
---
* Legion: Julie's Mix Tape, Scratched Ruler
---
* Huntress: Leather Loop, Berus Toxin
---
* Pig: Last Will, Combat Straps
---
* Nurse: Dark Cincture, Wooden Horse
---
* Clown: Sticky Soda Bottle, Finger-less Parade Gloves
---
* Wraith: Bone Clapper, The Ghost - Soot
---
* Spirit: Rin's Broken Watch, Gifted Bamboo Comb
---
Hopefully this will be able to allow you to understand how Freddy isn't great. His addons like most other killers elevate him. But if you are judging all killers power based on their most broken addons you might need to adjust your view them to understand without these addons they do much worse. And in Freddie's case create a tire fire.
---
And killers are welcome to give up on chases to patrol generators more.
---
I've made my point as well as I can make it.  You don't need all survivors on the rescue squad, just the ones where they need to be when it's convenient.  Similar to being able to run off for a flashlight save when you're in range.
---
I think we're really going to begin to see spicy plays once PTB is Live for a few weeks.
---
Wow how did you get this pic of me
---
how did you instantly heal after being in a trap?
---
If it pauses during chase, the survivors will run to the killer to get to use it, and if the killer slugs, then they have multiple ways to get back up before it expires.
---
Right now it's a safety perk that can be used for it's intention, but what you're asking would make it EXTREMELY powerful, and have buffed it.
---
Why aren’t we supposed to report them? 
---
I learned yesterday that it was possible to hit in midair, probably because of this little delay.
---
The system automatically flags them. No report needed.
---
Had a match yesterday with two people SWF who literally didn't do anything but crouch around. I tried to add the Killer just to tell 'em where those guys were hiding but he didn't accept.
---
I hate when SWFs do that. Sometimes j get really good ones that aren't toxic but sometimes you get these people where you just root for the Killer to annihilate them.
---
rendering bell wraith is so sexy
---
They don’t ban for DC’ing unless it’s extremely consistent. If your game crashes it won’t flag it as a DC.
---
Your shirt is like, "check out this shit!"
---
Yeah I know. The overall tendency stays the same though,  no dramatic changes since like 300 responses. If this goes well I'll make a more thorough survey. 
---
Yeah that makes me sensitive xD good one, tell another.
---
I'm having failed matchmaking all day. Lost a few party streamers, having to hard crash the game every two to three matches. Any magic I can apply to be able to not keep disappearing my offerings?
---
Type: in-game
---
Description: Camera stayed on the killer's shoulder after getting hooked.
---
When playing huntress I usually try trapping the survivor so I can get a hatchet hit, whether it’s in a pallet loop (which I just moon walk) or killer shack loop. Also I try to get the survivor to vault through windows. I just use her hatchets a lot, maybe too much. Maybe that’s because I can sneak up want to literally down a survivor fast. The way I deal with DS is I try to down them as closest to a hook as I can. You can always pressure a survivor with a hatchet no matter where you are, just winding it up is enough pressure to get them to react somehow.
---
Every joke ever that got popular.
---
Adrenaline probably 
---
I am not saying that is why I dc (tho I DC vs moonwalking legion and frank's legion), I'm just saying that it is something that causes people to DC a lot.
---
Something that I love to do if a Survivor was incredibly toxic is take them to the hatch, stand there for a moment, and then go to a hook. You only get the hatch if you play kindly. 
---
thats actually really well done goddamn
---
Aww poor baby. Cant even figure out your sexuality let alone the fact that I don't care about karma. But you stopped using the heart ;) sorry I hurt your feelings.
---
No, quick and quiet will be used when you are jumping out of the locker to stun them. That's what I was refering to.
---
Instead of hiding and hoping the killer won't find you, you can have a more reliable way of staying safe by maximising the distance between you and them.
---
I love all the toxic try hard survivors who downvoted your comment lol.. you weren’t even rude. You just spoke the truth. I myself was against NOED until I learned of the pleasure of smacking a cocky bitch down in one hit.
---
LOL DBD is far from being competitive. The failed tournaments clearly show that. It's a casual game with unbalanced gameplay. Accept that and move on with your life. 
---
Now when you're old you can explain why you have a few dicks on your arm.
---
Survivors genrushing is the punishment for a Killer not applying enough pressure. NOED gives them a free chance to come back from that, so they can still rank even though they haven't learned to get better. I honestly don't understand why so many Killers defend the perk. It hurts them in the long run if their goal is to actually be good at the game. I guess some people want their wins and don't care about improving though.
---
2v8 but you can’t have two of the same hunter. Like Identity V.
---
"He's not trying to kill you. He's just... expressing his excitement... with... interpretive dance!"
---
"Okay, even if that wasn't complete bull-shirt, I still wouldn't be wrong. Because no Good Place that's worth a carp would have any amount of interpretive dance in it."
---
The difference between BBQ and NOED is that there are tells if a killer uses BBQ (running toward specific gens, for example). Additionally, countering BBQ takes 4 seconds max, and failing to do so does not mean a free hook for the killer.
---
For NOED, there's no inclination that it's there before it's too late, takes well over a minute to counter at minimum, and not countering it can turn a 0k into a 4k
---
Its an example of powerful vs powerless. BBQ is a powerful perk, but NOED makes survivors feel powerless, which is why only that has controversy around it
---
Which
---
After playing her more, I was dead wrong in my initial reaction (I thought she was bad). I don't think she needs 110% speed while holding corrupted puke because it's something she usually has to go out of her way to get.  It's not a 1 to 1 comparison with Huntress hatchets. Corrupted purge has more limited range and a time limit whereas hatchets are the Huntress's normal power. 
---
Actually, I still used it, just on the first sentence. Not really my fault if you're too dumb to read more than a single sentence.
---
And no, bisexual is a sexuality too, but I suppose you'd need more than 5 braincells to figure that one out &lt;3
---
I suggest you grind and get spirit(if you don't have her). This new killer is good but I can guarantee you that spirit is better. If you have spirit then yeah just grind the 9k shards and get the plague. Only use money to buy the licensed killers.
---
Now where's my kiss? 
---
I edited my comment a lot since in the last minute, but you'd be using quick and quiet to quickly jump in the locker during a chase loop where you've broken line of sight and 3 seconds is not a long time when the killer doesn't not realize you've silently jumped in the locker during the chase.
---
I've been known to click leave game quite a few times. No point in playing with potatoes.

Omfg thank you so much for making this bro. I’ve been trying so hard to get a good look at her while she’s carrying me... And my computer is set to the lowest settings for graphics sooo... Haven’t been able to get a good look. Absolutely gorgeous shot. Thanks so much for taking the time to make this. I’m shook that her hair is grey/white.
---
Oh ok, I have read it again to update myself on what you've said.
---
I mean the killer can be paying attention to the scratches and notice that they stop in front of your locker. You are banking on the killer having really slow reaction time.
---
I do agree that the perk has uses, but I don't think it's powerful enough even when combined with other things that it validates giving it an exhaustion debuff. A timer like quick and quiet would be enough.
---
This... actually made me really happy. Half the time if I’m the last person left and get caught, I accept defeat and don’t bother struggling. Never knew that some killers would give me the hatch cuz of that lul. Gtk
---
And I wasn't referring to quick and quiet at all for hiding a locker, I just meant for stealthy players who can use spine chill, just UE into a locker when it goes off, then either you evade the killer, and not start a chase at all leaving head on and sprint burst for another time or if head on wasn't exhaustion you could stun them and sprint burst away if they check the locker and you've just gained a huge amount of time to find a new spot.
---
You've asked the same question twice.  "Why use the perk when there are better?"   
---
It's been answered. 'Better' is only better if it suits the playstyle,  the abilities, and awareness of the player.  If it doesn't suit yours, that's fine.  However, a perk that can turn every locker into a reusable pallet drop via timer cooldown (rather than exhaustion) is a move that leans towards imbalance by way of affecting chase routes.
---
It doesn't matter if there are better perks -- at all.  It has no absolutely no place in the discussion on whether Head On should or shouldn't have exhaustion.  I would be thrilled as a survivor to have Head On not use exhaustion - because I know just how I would abuse the hell out of it.  Hence, why I'm not arguing for that mechanic - it can be abused to create infinites again on multiple maps with just one friend in a game.
---
I know I'm going to be using a map with crystal bead a LOT.  Tell teammates to get hit in front of, or run past a locker with the light pillar when they need a save.  SMASH!
---
That's all. 
---
She can get looped hard due to her height as well. Very easy to track. I think she's really well balanced. 
---
Fist time I went against it blew my mind! 
---
my exact train of thought lol
---
It rewards killers for making mistakes.
---
The Behavior interactive wiki
---
Lol yeah, dbd in a nutshell. 
---
To be fair, this requires you to play as the wraith, which is a big enough challenge as it is
---
*cries in bing bong*
---
DS has always punished the KILLER for doing well...
---
It's meant to be a safety net, like Borrowed Time. Should Borrowed Time pause while in chase?
---
&gt;I mean the killer can be paying attention to the scratches and notice that they stop in front of your locker. You are banking on the killer having really slow reaction time.
---
And I totally agree with that (although it does work on some low rank killers), but I mean if you've been looping around walls and a pallet or even the shack there will be marks every where and they won't be able to tell that you've stopped if they lost sight, even losing sight for a second to jump in a shack locker is surprisingly effective a lot of the time because most killers will continue trying to mind game you or think you are mind gaming them. And personally I think having it on a cool down would just bring us back to the days before the exhaustion nerf where any decent survivor could just waste a killer's time.
---
Holy mother of truth 😤
---
It happens most commonly if you happen to get stuck on something, you can outrun him only if you run in a straight line, otherwise he catches up especially with beast marks.
---
The add-ons are there to make the killer better. Any killer other than Nurse would hella weak without add-ons. And yes you can always use the desried add-ons. I just save up 1mil BP and spend it all on Freddy. I don't run Class Photo every game, most games I run Green Dress and Nancys Masterpeice and play the exact same way, these are add-ons of uncommon and rare rarity
---
Survivors who burn Gideon Meat Plant offerings 
---
This is rad, I really like the placement too
---
What is this Moonwalk you talk about?
---
&gt;DS has always punished the KILLER for doing well...
---
yeah and they reworked it because of exactly that, no? Is it supposed to punish the survivor now? If so that's an amazing idea for a rework, not gonna lie.
---
Borrowed time allows you to take a hit early and doesnt require you to get picked up by the killer. You can use the hit's speed boost to gain more distance on the killer. With the new ds if you get hit after running the killer around you get nothing.
---
There's a ranking system henceforth it's competetive. And regardless people who leave ruin the game for everyone involved. If the game has a dedicated matchmaker and a commited match with no drop-in-and-out mechanics then leaving in the middle of the match ruins the game for everyone else involved.
---
But you're the kind of guy who arrives for a buisness meeting 30 minutes late and wonders what the big deal is.
---
And the pleasure of knowing you needed NOED to get a kill on someone who you admitted was better than you
---
you melon head, I can't stop laughing
---
 "I never actually said anything mildly offensive" You're a narcissist and projecting heavily on me, this conversation is ended as its pointless unless I just wanna hear you " "never actually said anything mildly offensive" over and over.
---
What you say are lies and exaggeration and as I said a projection of your own thoughts and feelings. Its a dark place and I bid you farewell.
---
Cheers!
---
The exhaustion changes should have been only implemented on sprint burst, as it was the only problematic one of them.
---
All the rest of them are situational and in case of dead hard don't even give you much distance. I really dislike how they punished all of the exhaustion perks just because sprint burst is bs.
---
I don’t listen to Claudette mains who need to play a broken and invisible character to escape.. sorry
---
Have fun with it! 
---
I played wraith and it was a bug for 3 mins still, also I don't have any issues playing wraith. He's great with certain add ons :D
---
No, Distressing only gives you more points for actions int he deviousness category. EX, if you get 100 deviousness you would get 200 with distressing.
---
When do I know if I have to go to the fountains?
---
When I'm broken? 
---
Her massive alien head is what forced me to upvote the post. Well played, OP.
---
It'll be good info for the more one sided players indeed.
---
Cool, imma call the cops
---
On PS4 so that would mean that you would have to go directly on their profile.
---
Do you go out your way to message killers who camp?
---
Seems like a lot of unnecessary hassle.
---
Oh god
---
It's not overly sensitive, it's plain wrong. 
---
Will have to try it out then. Never used that perk. Just sucks to have to waste a perk slot on not getting bullied hahaha
---
CONFIRMED: IT DOESN'T WORK WITH THE TALL KILLERS 
---
Only think if it's The Game offering they've burned.
---
Noed is like Bullet Bill in Mario kart, makes up for being bad
---
Yep, using them when your not broken just makes it easier for the killer, buy as much time as possible without giving her the power 
---
&gt;Any killer other than Nurse would hella weak without add-ons. 
---
Looks at Hag, Hillbilly, Huntress, and Spirit.
---
&gt;And yes you can always use the desried add-ons. I just save up 1mil BP and spend it all on Freddy.  
---
Funny I don't need to do the same thing with any other killer, perhaps I'm just not fully understanding how Freddy requires dumping in 1 million BP to play him. Damn shame that I would prefer to play other characters that don't require high tier addons to do well.
---
Perhaps I should only play The Shape with Fragrant Tuft Of Hair and J. Myers Memorial. Obviously that means the killer is broken and deserves a nerf. 
---
&gt;I don't run Class Photo every game, most games I run Green Dress and Nancys Masterpeice and play the exact same way, these are add-ons of uncommon and rare rarity 
---
Good one. And all Legions mains don't run Cold Dirt and Frank's Mixtape every game and say how he is not under powered without them. I think the last time you used an uncommon addon was back when he was first released. Why would you, you just stop playing him when you run out of rare and above addons. Obviously the sign of a very powerful killer.
---
It actually looks amazing.
---
Except for when it doesn't make a difference cus either all totems are broken or the lit totem is really close to a surv...
---
Orrrr even when all the survs just open an exit gate and leave
---
This means that you've completed the game.
---
Congrats  :)
---
No they should put them with rank 1’s
---
Someone in the swf usually does. And usually only if they are extremely toxic, face camping, etc.
---
Okay that's sounds logical 
---
So dead hard would help, right?
---
But is there any counterplay like calm spirit against doctor, spine chill against freddy, ect ? 
---
&gt;lacks counterplay (Freddy mainly)
---
Freddy's existence is his biggest counterplay. Why you DC'ing on the worst killer?
---
I think that Swamp just sucks ass for killer and survivor: it's a very boring map to play on. You can at least have some fun on The Game playing against/as the Pig and Myers.
---
I honestly prefer the game over the swamp at this point.
---
When you get farmed off the hook by an asshole teammate so you stand there so you can get downed and make them lose benevolent points but the killer just ignores you
---
So why use it?
---
Because the probability of it being useful is way higher than
---
Nice 
---
Dw, all that matters is that we've cleared up any misunderstandings.
---
Bubba can be romantic, he'd make a homemade dinner with candlelight 
---
I honestly love The Game. It’s two floors and the fact that it’s indoors make it much easier to lose the killer, and for killers it’s easier to patrol gens.
---
How can you say someone who regularly 4k's is terrible at the game ? I dont understand
---
More when someone burn a jigsaw or lerys
---
I love it.
---
As survivor, you turn your character around and start walking backwards by pressing a and d while holding either w or s with pretty perfect timing. Doesn’t do anything, it’s just cool.
---
You literally need to throw yourself at the killer if you want to get the chance to use it, it runs out by the time you eventually get caught once you got tunneled off the hook.
---
For how situational it is (having to throw yourself at the killer) it isn't strong in its new niche situation. Plus for no reason at all they've nerfed the stun duration from 4 seconds to 3. With Enduring the stun is less than 2 seconds, it gives you no meaningful distance.
---
The perk doesn't help you when getting tunneled, since the killer can tunnel you normally and then wait for 10 seconds left after they've downed you.
---
Thanks
---
Kindess works both ways, matches that i get teabaged and looped for every, I act like an ass,  I have games where I was just wrecking the survivors but then stopped downing them once I hooked everyone twice.  Its no fun when the game is toxic. 
---
Lol then how did you know it dies after a few days?
---
BHVR: it’s free real estate
---
There was a post a while ago about giving Small game the total amount of Totems left on the map. Would make it even better than it is for Totem hunting.
---
Did you "bang bang bang" before you pulled your trigger?
---
Brutal Strength with the purple add on for "tremendously faster at breaking shit while cloaked" and the auras while cloaked add on is pretty dope.
---
I must go my people need me
---
Some people were using no mither and dead hard but that isn't too good since yeah you can't be broken again so her vomit is literally useless but you're still one hit. I think stealth is the best defence against her, so any stealth perks would be good.
---
Maybe it's meant to be very situational, as it's essentially an extra life?
---
Boneclapper+Ghost+good positioning=free grabs
---
No sound bell addon + ghost = many free grabs
---
And best of all:
---
Boneclapper + fast disappearing = the ability to spamm the bells globaly very fast nonstop so you can annoy the survivors or make them mute the game
---
no it doesn't, but the killer's time is a bit more valuable as there aren't 3 other killers out there killing survivors.
---
I used to watch his streams. He’s terrible lol
---
His YouTube videos paint him in a way better light. 
---
Maybe he’s improved but doubt it 
---
And all the killers that are regarded as solid, viable picks don't rely on just M1 mind games in chases. Hence why Freddy's lack of an applicable power during chases makes him lackluster. 
---
Every single killer's power should be multi-purpose. It needs to have an affect outside of and during a chase. Otherwise the process of finding as well as downing become mundane and tedious. 
---
i feel like she does would have a harder time infecting is closed off maps like larrys. stick to corners loop her around buy your teammates as much time as possible... 
---
in my own optionion don't bother healing by the fountain unless your in the broken status effect. Try to pick one that's farthest from where your teammates are at . (they are highlighted similar to pig boxes) As she needs to go to that specific one to gain corrupt vomit. .... this is of course if she doesnt down your ass lol 
---
I assume you are asking for use on the Legion. 
---
FPS has no effect on the chase mechanic. 
---
The chase mechanic is activated when there is a **running** survivor within your field of view and within a certain range, roughly 12-16 meters. 
---
The chase mechanic ends under a few circumstances. 
---
* When the survivor is no longer running, but still in range for upwards of 5 seconds, more or less 
---
* When the survivor is out of range
---
This means you can look up, down, left, right, or behind you and the chase will never begin until the survivor is in your field of view, no matter how close they are. 
---
If you want the best use out of Legion's frenzy for killing one survivor quickly, hit them twice and immediately back up during your stun. Most survivors continue running away, and therefore quickly out of range, starting the timer much quicker. You then follow them, but take care to not look at them once you get too close. 
---
Once their bleed out timer is below 1/4, you can hit them with Frenzy to easily down them. Most survivors have tried to hide and mend by this point, so you can get an easy hit.  
---
Planning for failure is the perfect way to put it. Use a perk that lets you avoid failure instead. 
---
But it's not good in it's situation. It is not an extra life as by the time when it could give you that supposed extra life it has long expired.
---
Wouldn't change the issues. Would weaken her in the wrong areas. 
---
Raise the ban hammer 🤬
---
No, almost all complaints about legion are about franks mixtape, moonwalking, and the sheer lack of counterplay to the killer. I very rarely see anyone talk about his game slow potential as most people are fine with it. 
---
So apparently looks like it only work with PIG and it only works ON THAT SPECIFIC Window
---
It would instead be an overall nerf to her power and make the add-on pretty worthless.
---
Not to mention you have BHVR-endorsed streamers do it. 
---
New dailys:
---
1. Touch a generator
---
2. Hide in a locker for a total of 2 seconds
---
3. Live for a total of 3 nanoseconds
---
It's, you know, kind of OBVIOUS.
---
You play to see the New characters and their mechanics, but your progress don't save, so you're lossing time:the same time you could be spending to Farm.
---
That would be great buff for Small Game, solo survivor would be much more frustrating that way. Great idea man.
---

Swamp is good for survivor tho 
---
Freddy does have multi-purpose, Tracking and disruption
---
Aye, a scratch, a scratch! 
---
I believe you could of added more questions like least survivor/killer used, time played in a week, favorite/least favorite map.
---
*laughs in tier 1 with hair and tombstone*
---
It’s 45, and Enduring is not a perk I would use, but still a good perk on Anna.
---
as streamers have said in the past the ptb dies due to not finding games , dc, blah blah blah 
---
for those who stick with it till its offline kudos to them
---
lol he's talking about survivors doing it
---
Not a single one of those are applicable to a chase. 
---
You're completely grasping at straws. 
---
Wait... that’s illegal.

Sorry didn't realise it was so OBVIOUS I also play on console
---
Good Plague players will try and predict where you're going to run to instead of aiming for where you are. If you're trying to loop and she's charging her vile purge try and leave the loop, she'll end up waiting for you to show up in part of the loop only to find you've left, buying you more time.
---
After using the fountains I suggest getting as far away from it as possible. If you're nearby when she gains corrupted purge (which can damage you like an M1 hit) you're more likely to get downed since it has a long range and is very easy to aim. Make her waste time trying to find you, it's your best shot. Purge is blocked by jungle gyms as long as you're ducking behind them. If she has corrupted purge find cover, it will help a lot.
---
If she has corrupted purge and you're trying to unhook someone *be very careful*. Her ability works like Bubba's chainsaw but with a longer range, so she can hit both you and the unhooked survivor in one shot. She's hell when it comes to basements if she's got corrupted purge.
---
Overall, she's pretty fun to play against. She not under-powered and since corrupted purge isn't active for a lot of the game, she doesn't feel overpowered either. You just have to make smart decisions on timing things. Just listen for when she's activated corrupted purge (you'll know the sound when you hear it), at that point you have to be careful.
---
BTW if corrupted purge is active, you don't get sick from getting hit, but you can get sick if she vomits on you while you're on the hook. As time goes on, I expect Plague players will vomit on the hook less and less since it gives the survivor a free heal when they use fountains, but as of now it's a popular tactic for them.
---
Hope this helps
---
Adams he does own a very handsome suit for dinners.
---
Now thats a good meme
---
That makes a lot of sense, I hadn't heard anyone talking about those issues before, I rarely watch streamers though, I play console and like to avoid as much as I can until the new chapters drop so it's more of a surprise
---
&gt; I think her corrupted purge needs to grant the sprint burst since it damages.
---
It already does.
---
It's the surv main in me lol
---
It's ok, and Sorry for the caps Lock "Obvious", i'm from another country and my spell checker from my phone sometimes caps lock some words
---
Wow look at the downvotes. Clearly the tunnel happy killers are about.
---
wait that's illigal
---
So you mean Wraith downs everyone faster than in 3 seconds?
---
I just take them down over and over until I get them to the hatch or they give up and let me take them. Sometimes they just leave the room or something and it takes them a minute to realize that they're on the hatch.
---
It has counter play, not my fault
---
people are allergic to cleansing totems.
---
More like Meg-a brain
---
The Spirit also killed no one.
---
Best guess is that the Entity saw potential in The Plague due to her blindly following her God/s so she could be made to do whatever the Entity wants.
---
Because he is Mother fucking sonic. His gotta go fast bitch ass
---
#PATCH THIS
---
getting genrushed isn't a real thing, learn to put out map pressure. \*granted I know this is a meme\*
---
Exactly!😁 I have some mates who can’t play without it, they love it that much.
---
I'm glad they're making pipping harder it's a joke as is, I'd rather not be in red ranks after 10 games thanks
---
Well played sir! 
---
You are missing my point. If a legion wants you downed, they will get you and it will happen in a set amount of time almost every time due to how their power works. The killer is poorly designed and honestly they should have seen this issue before his release but somehow failed to.
---
Franks is more than a different way of playing legion. Chases last 15-30 seconds with franks and cold dirt and there is nothing you as the survivor can do to stop it against a competent player. I see no way in which this is fair or reasonable as there is next to no skill required by the killer to perform this. 
---
I had collected over 100 of those in 2 years since I never burn Map Offerings.
---
Burnt like 10 in a row and everyone in end game always was like "which of you fuckers did that".
---
I still feel guilty about it lmao
---
Hey, what are you doing insulting Jumpscare Myers! He just wants to scare u

Dead by daydwight? no?
---
That was the intended idea but they ended up making a killer that is godly at tunneling. While it is not solely a legion issue, he is standing at the pinnacle of it.
---
This already happens 😂
---
Uhhh. Well I hope you tell him/her that it’s not needed most time. Lmao. 
---
Not what you were saying earlier, but alright.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they added an option like this. Should make this suggested on the official dbd forums. Can very much see a "give up" option for downed survivors.
---
Iron Maiden is so good on her. Your reload time is hugely reduced and you get notified if anyone uses a locker. I honestly think every huntress should run it, especially with BBQ

There’s no place like Haddonfield...

Ooh, big pants there, Brie Larson, are you sure you wouldn't rather be playing CoD?
---
Dead by Crate-light
---
Even better when the killer is Legion 
---
thank you! you’re so sensitive that you’re feelings are apparently too hurt to come up with anything better. 
---
I think you should respond with a “No U” and really drive home the point you’re trying pretty hard to make. That’ll show me :-)
---
I play 4-9 a day on average and I don’t think I’d hit it consistently in a day playing like that. 
---
Oh yea that’s so hot 
---
Try and fit Iron Will into your loadout; really strong against Spirit and killers in general.
---
Is le shitpost
---
Tbagging I understand but don’t get angry you get looped, it’s literally what a survivor has to do.
---
He's an edgelord that's angry over people being nice to eachother in a video game, everything would be too much for him.
---
Dude can you take a second to check the flair of the post? If you already have, then i respect your opinion lol
---
If you are using stealth its best to use it when she is in her corrupt stage (the harmful puke). She basically becomes a easy huntress allowing her to do easy hits on you around loops. Avoid her at that stage when you hear an audio cue when the plague as drinked from one of the fountains. She has 45 seconds by default of her power and is unlikely to search for you for an extended period of time due to the nature of her power. 
---
Without corrupt I would stay stick to loops and walls as it makes it much harder to hit you with the vomit. Try to avoid vaults in her line of sight if you see her holding the puke as she can easily infect you. Just try to block line of sight and use walls and obstacles like you were dodging a huntress axe.  
---
One time I was last alive vs a huntress and knew where the hatch was so I was crawling towards it while she hooked my buddy. 
---
She then picked me up and proceeded to carry me around the entire other side of the map looking for the hatch to give me.
---
My dumbass finally got impatient and thought it’d be a good idea to struggle off and point in the direction of the hatch but the second I wiggled she NOPED the fuck out to the nearest hook
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Omg why didn’t I think about that lol. Do you think light weight would pair well with that against her?
---
Lmfao. That's really great. Tell another one.
---
He's a harasser type killer. 
---
Honestly that's such a mood
---
I’m running both of those perks every game atm, because scratch marks are busted. Iron Will is all you need for Spirit though, and when she phases just walk instead of run.
---
Also, when she phases she has to move through the world normally. So finding a vault asap is essential to lasting in chases.
---
I dont think people have been banned for editing a setting file for more fps, i could be wrong but i highly doubt it. Ive been running it for 2 years
---
i admire your persistence :-) you’re getting a little annoying now so I’ll stop but congrats you get the last word :-)
---
Loool
---
Had a match yesterday against a huntress, I didn’t wiggle cause I just wanted the match to end. She took me to the hatch and dropped me a few feet away knowing that I would bleed out before I reached the hatch lol
---
as an avid Balanced Landing user, I never mind an old fashioned swamp offering. even the Meat Plant offerings work in my favor. 
---
And I didn't even use a Mori.
---
Give her ❤ back :(
---
Poor little baby Dwight
---
rip
---
A SCRATCH?! YOUR ARM'S OFF! 
---
They ‘buffed’ medium vaults and ‘nerfed’ perks effecting vault speed. So a soft hit to Spine Chill.
---
Any guesses? :)
---
Romeo and Juliet? Nah, more like Hamlet. 
---
Why are all of your Os crying
---
That's.... not true. Because then 3 of them lose everything. It would maybe encourage members of a SWF to D.C. When only one person is left, but they do that already.
---
No, what will actually happen is regular survivors will feel like it's ok to leave, since at least the teammates they're forcing to lose get BPs
---
You’ve got some perfect teeth there
---
Literally who gives a shit
---
One of the few times lag doesn't fuck you over.
---
Swamp sucks but when a survivor burns a lerys offering its time to throw hands
---
This is just one big salty dumb KKona
---
Imagine caring this much about a ranking system that is garbage
---
I FOUND you, faker! 
---
Gay ass font tho. Lmao
---
Living slugs are important for applying pressure so I'd hate this option.
---
If I get bored being slugged I just DC or go make a coffee or something.
---
Not impossible on any FPS you have, but the more FPS you get the more precise you have to be in tapping A/D, ~55FPS should be the best to do it. 
---
You can change your FPS rate with the GameUserSettings.ini in your gamefiles. Which also makes it possible to get more than 60 FPS, given your pc and monitor can handle it.
---
They should make pipping harder but not safety pipping because as survivor it’s really easy to depip if the killer wants to be a dick 
---
Here we go again.... 
---
Because a font has a sexuality. 
---
What was your favourite computer game 5 years ago?  So you wish you had a logo from that game tattooed on yourself now?
---
It's uploading. Once it's done, I'll provide a link.
---
Im rank 1 lol.
---
no, i mean chasing for longer than 2 seconds is a challenge for wraith
---
Yeah and I worked so hard to get it before so I was a little upset
---
Heaven forbid people try to have fun in a video game, and when they AREN'T having fun, leave the game that they aren't having fun in!  
---
((also literally who gives a fuck))
---
The first post in that forum thread is nuts and would make the Plague ridiculously OP.
---
This
---
Yeah I honestly don't know why people fall for the old "I'm gonna hook you and leave except obviously I'm just gonna walk away and phase back to the hook in time to down you again" trick. 
---
Also you fo realize the system is AUTOMATED? You do realize that right? The devs don't manually ban for DCs, it's a bot-system that bases it off the % of DCs pretty sure, so you know, it's not special treatment.
---
There are many,many reasons
---
Its just gonna make rank 1 queues really long. I doubt the changes will go through. People already de rank to avoid being rank 1 
---
That font is cancer my dude.
---
the tydepod army finally finished booting up internet explorer i see

Part of why I like Legion so much, you can max out your Deviousness, Hunting and even your Brutality meters by the time the gate's are open. I let whole teams go at that point.

---
Escape -&gt; Leave Game
---
I had one last night that was kinda weird.  It was an obvious 3-man SWF with a +1.  I hunted and chased like I normally do, downed one, hooked.  Downed another, hooked.  Caught the first on on a generator, downed again, hook #2, then he disconnects.  Couple seconds later, the other two disconnect, too. 
---
I found the random +1 standing next to a hook, I guess like "OK, let's get this over with."  But I'm like, naw, man—I'm not giving you a hard time because three dudes decided to rage off, you're getting some points.
---
There were still five generators left, so I lead the dude to the nearest generator, and they get to working on that.  I had T3 Unnerving Presence on, which I had completely forgotten about, so they were borking the skill checks, but they get it up and running, and my HUD now says 4 gens left.  If I understand the mechanics right, we need to get one more generator done before the hatch will spawn, so I head off to the next closest generator when all the sudden, screen goes black, Ruthless Killer pops up, and the end-game screen shows three disconnects and one escape.
---
Never figured out what happened.  Nothing in the post-game except GG and done.  I'm not sure if the hatch was there the whole time and my HUD was bugged out or if my knowledge of hatch requirements if off.  Whatever happened, that last dude got out somehow.
---
Or at least turn it off once you’ve readied. It’s so weird to me that they’re still active at that point. 
---

imagine stepping out and the killer just fucking tumbles to their death 
---
She does not do it enough to trigger the system, therefore not doing a bannable action.
---
If you wanna call it special treatment; why can I instantly DC every single Coldwind and Haddonfield match as killer, and every single Legion as surv and not get banned? I'm not a streamer or a whisperer?
---
**Because it isn't bannable in restricted quantities.**
---
XD I'm not a liberal snowflake, you however seem to be just as fragile, and as much of a high and mighty "If you don't like how we're handling this thing you like then go away" bitchiness as her. Now run along, edgelord, your deal is more playing Hatred and pretending it's a serious game made with good story telling.

It doesn’t really look like it’s from a game if you don’t know dbd. I think it looks great 
---
Check my post history 😭 we need to he friends man
---
I'd like you to consider the fact that NOED is only useful when all 5 generators are completed. Personally, I think the killer should be trying to prevent that from happening. Maybe if you ran something that helped you in tracking or chasing, they wouldn't get 5 gens so often?
---
How are you doing that????
---
Seriously? Thank you so much!

Yes and No, I like all the other movies

A way I found works it to crank the dpi on my mouse up to max, look up and spin the fuck around for a good few seconds. If anything else they turn to look at wtf you are doing and then if you look at them and don’t move they tend to get it. Especially if there have been at least two dcs within a couple of seconds of starting a game. 
---
With the phone
---
Yea I’ve heard people talking about basement saves with it 
---
Followed by insta dc
---
Is that the remote play for some reason only in IOS? Also thought you couldn't use a dualshock controller. 
---
I can, with near certainty, tell everyone that the harder pipping is a result of a bug of the hook proximity camping point decrease. 
---
This is based off of the patchnotes, the screenshot of tru3 with nothing in Chaser, and general experience with Bhvr
---
This font is bad and you should feel bad for it
---
Everyone acting like OP's crazy for this, but he completely has a point.

If you're just a random player or an unaffiliated streamer, do whatever you want.

Too bad this was removed by mods, I hate people who openly don't give a fuck about disconnecting and do it to give unfair advantages mid-game.

---

---
good, try it on the outside too 
---
Wow. Why do atheists always come off so edgy.
---
Uh no I highly disagree with this as a killer main, if your unhooking in front of the killer that's already your problem and shouldn't be punished for it 
---
oscar is a pretty gay name so 
---
They probably increased the range you lose points from if youre too close to the hook. Maybe too much? I dont know. You might have to actually leave the hook instead of doing mini circles around it til someone saves.
---
you dont know cancer, my dude.
---
Nope, but you come onto a post where people are talking about how people are being nice to eachother when someone DCs, trying to be edgy and going on about how you're going on to just be a dick about it, and I'm sure you can see the down votes you've taken, and in your own logic of if someone doesn't like how things are handled in something they like then they should go away, why don't you and your edginess get out of the thread where people try to be nice to eachother and go play something where your spiked jacket and in store ripped jeans are more appropriate; Hatred. It's just 6 bucks on steam.
---
Ehh it’s happened in other games. I think it’s a known issue w the stealth 700’s.
---
because of killers like this guy.
---
I forgot which headset I have, but it does help most times. I think there is some directional sound issues with it though.
---
Personally, I wish the BGM in game was adjustable so I'm not hearing ambient noises when I'm trying to hear Survivors. Bad enough my Killer makes noise on his own, I don't need the bad lofi beat with it.
---
Man, you don't say something like that after someone gets a tat. Not cool.
---
Not tru3, at least as far as I know. I doubt it tho.
---
(hx)
---
Yeah wireless headsets can be unreliable.
---
The difference between you and him is that you currently have to explain why you Are a dick. 
---
The fact that its not often you'd M1 through a pallet is exactly why its such a good idea to M1 through pallets sometimes with Huntress.
---
edgy because I said God isnt real? totes.
---
Press r1 to doubt
---
Regularly 4k'ing isnt hard lol literally main nurse and you have to try to lose. I was regularly 4k'ing til like rank 4 with trapper only. Not saying True isnt good but its not the best testament of skill.
---
Derankers are also pussies who disconnect when they don’t like how the game’s going, so fuck them
---
Cause people rarely use it
---
I don’t understand the hate. Why is Swamp bad? The only thing I could possibly think of is totem placements for Ruin. I totally understand Lery’s and Gideon though.
---
So this is why we got a recap 
---
Not saying that I"m unhooking a survivor I'm being the survivor being unhooked in front of the killer 99% of my matches as Survivor, its super annoying because then the killer just tunnels me until death hook. 
---
I respect your beliefs but fuck, stop spouting "ugh, God isnt real" whenever God is even mentioned. It's annoying.
---
Slight confuse
---
They are turning it off in the next patch
---
I think objective wise Survivor is easier than Killer with the mechanics the game currently has. But this is opening a can of worms that we don't need to be opened again...
---
Just equip the bloody versiom of her outfit and boom ur invisible
---
The fundamental aim is the same: what you are doing is wrong and not supposed to happen.  
---
If anything, you deciding to DC against Legion or as killer on certain maps goes to show that these streamers do hold sway and influence on the community at large.  Hence why the DC epidemic continues to grow.  
---
It does not matter if it is survivor or killer, intentional DCing is DCing.  
---
As for your other question, message me the fog whisperer and I will get around to bringing visibility their way.  
---
Wow that’s actually a really good one, I’ve seen some shitty ones before 
---
I respect your right to believe in a magical man in the sky, but you telling me not to say God isnt real is like me saying wl dont mention God and I wont point out that God doesn't exist. its dumb.

Spread this over Twitter, Steam forums, official forums, Reddit, wherever.  I appreciate the gesture, but I am not doing this for karma farming.  I am doing this because I want this community to become better and more positive.  It will not be possible if BHVR allows these streamers to continue unabated.

Clown: He's boring and rather strong.

Reality: He's only fun if you like what he does, and he's very mediocre in terms of viability.

Just my belief though.

ITT survivor cant have any nice things without it being broken. Dont waste your breath guys if we have any combos the game is over. Meanwhile gens blocked for 90 seconds with hex ruin with thanatophobia and some other annoying perk :(. Maybe we should all just run left behind only because thats what we is now.
---
As far as I’m aware this is a bug and nothing to do with SWF.
---
I’ve played R1 killer and had 3 perk less rank 20 potatoes to verse and another R1.
---
Alternatively I’ve seen a three man of R1s vs a rank 20 killer.
---
It’s a bug.
---
Lol, that would be so funny
---
The state has become significantly better for killer and near enough balanced. Pallet vacuum is gone, pallets are more evenly distributed to avoid double palleting. More pallets that have mind game potential are available. 
---
Overall the game state seems to have improved according to players that have played in that time but there is still some RNG base on how well the map forms for survivors. Idk if it existed a year ago but windows get blocked by the entity if they are used 3 times by the survivor in quick succession. Helps with getting looped. The biggest thing is the removal of pallet vacuum allowing for hits through pallets if timed right and the ability to mind game survivors in small loops.
---
He's very add on reliant, but with good add ons he can be pretty decent.
---
are you in the PTB or the regular game?
---
I tried Fast Disappearing + increased movespeed while cloaked. You basically get to teleport across the map for free. It's amazing.
---
Disagree, it is helpful for bloodpoints
---
I know, i didn't think anything of the font when i posted this but God damn it apparently sent everyone into the same daze.  bout to change my font real quick and retake the screenshot lmao.

everyone should be coming irl

There is a big flaw in his Add-ons. Coxcombed clapper actually makes him viable and quite strong but without it he lacks everything (other then speed). 
---
To rely on an ultra rare add-on is complete bs and the only other viable add-on (Swift) makes him slower then crouch speed while uncloaking (which btw completely destroys the ability to catch someone off loops). 
---
This results in good survivor looping you until you force the pallet... I mean freddy has to do the same but a good freddy can do way more then a good wraith.
---
oh and lets not forget that any survivor with decent eye sight can spot you from 20 meters away
---
Did anyone really expect them too? No legion changes yet lol. They dont change anything except perks and SOMETIMES items.

This is the kind of tattoo that even years after the game is gone will still look fucking sick.
---
The game has been killer favored for quite a while now 
---
And when I opened that video I randomly clicked a time stamp and got tydetyme saying nurse is weak because they made it so she gets stunned by pallets lmao. Thank god no one listens to that moron anymore. 
---
Yes... but to rely on an ultra rare add-on is just wrong.
---
It's literally the most basic killer perk and is easily dealt with by cleansing totems. So by you knowing about it and doing nothing about it kinda shows who's better already. 
---
Pirate killer doesn’t use a sword come on man! 
---
All jokes aside this one is great but no cutlass?
---
JuSt LeArN hOw To FiGhT hEr 4HEAD ASS
---
I dont think she broken i just think this is the most idiotic argument ever. I thought the PTB was Patch TESTING bullshit. Whats the point in having a PTB if youre not gonna change anything? Just release the new chapter.
---
Pro - killer would have to target the other survivor, giving the death to the farmer instead.
---
Con - randoms may avoid rescuing entirely if they feel they will be in danger
---
Could be worth testing out in ptb at the very least.
---
Oh, I didn't think about it being that many players. Makes more sense now.
---
Wraith's power isn't needed to kill survivors, whereas Freddy's is required if you even just want to hit the survivor. At that Legion without add-ons is also bad because of their slow movement speed and the ineffectiveness of their power to really help slow down the game in a meaningful way. 
---
Wraith's power while not that exciting at least lets him get close to survivors without them noticing ideally. Wraith isn't the strongest, but he's far from the weakest. 
---
Console Nurse is borderline unplayable due to how poorly the game runs for her, let alone the difficulties of aiming your post-blink attacks with a controller.
---
I will say that Wraith is probably the second worst killer after Console Nurse, which sucks because Bing Bong Boi used to be my main but I hardly ever touch him any more because he is so easily countered and his power so useless outside of low ranks.  And my mains are Pig, Trapper, and fucking Freddy Fazbitch, so it’s not exactly like I’m particularly picky about how strong my killers are, yet even by my standards Wraith is not only boring but unplayably useless.
---
Could be something with your RAM or processor. Do you look at Task Manager while playing to see what the .exe looks like?
---
They did, except, it still doesn’t explain why there is such a high minimum of points to simply even pop.
---
Pretty much
---
Good to hear they bought it back from seabreeze, or is it starbreeze, fingers crossed it helps them although they were only there to help them publish their own game which is what they done with Payday.
---
How can it be stupid to call them what they are. I was part of Beta on PC and advised of issues I still see in the game today.
---
As I have already said that there are plenty of games that can publish patches to games on a weekly basis with no issue from Sony or Microsoft if you want an example I'll point you towards Fortnite.
---
While it may be cheaper to work on one build, let's not use the word efficient as it is incorrectly used here since ignoring a PTB for the consoles only provides more issues to ignore which, as I've said, is what they do.
---
Deep wounds is terrible and the whole problem. No way they're fixed without a rework. The core part of their kit is broken on its base level.
---
Whatever you have to tell yourself small child trying to be an edgelord and had to pick a fight with people who were just enjoying themselves talking about being nice to eachother in a video game. Maybe it's quite telling of your life that you feel such a need to be so edgy in the presence of people who are just being friendly to eachother. Either way, you keep saying that I'm not worth your time, but your come backs are just so pathetic and you always have to come back again whenever you get verbally smacked down. Now, go back to your sulking corner and play some Hatred.
---
Ah, thank you.
---
What the hell. 
---
If the problem is being bored because the killer can't find you, give them built in Deerstalker. Problem solved. 
---
Slugged survivors can see auras, for free. This suggestion is stupidly biased. 
---
PTB is basically just an advertisement for the new patch and to create hype for the new patch.
---
That may help a bit.  Depending on how frustrated you get, whenever there's a free weekend for dbd would be the best time to grind up to 15+.  Those will definitely be the heaviest new player moments. 
---
I have the worst luck lol. Need more Chalk Pouches I guess...
---
If all the fountains are corrupt, they become pure
---
Wraith sounds more usable then he is trust me. Wraith has no way of slowing the game down at all. Legion and Freddy can waste some time and if you know when and who to hit/sleep you will be way more succesfull with legion and freddy then you ever can with Wratih. I tried to make Wraith work for a very long time now and he just is the worst character in my eyes. 
---
No. And I'll use Reddit as I see fit not what you want.
---
If you really think that is me putting him down you must live a very sheltered life, I hadn't actually been harsh at all.  I didn't mention the poor quality, the lack of detail, the fact that when he trys to explain what the game was about when it's long forgotten he's going to sound like an active shooter, the fact it's going to put alot of employers off, the fact its location is going to make it difficult to hide... And I'm still not being harsh...
---
Again if you are scared of seeing opinions you don't like, probably don't post on an open forum for feedback, do you think I'm the only person who thinks this?
---
Why do you think there are so many jokes about no ragrets?
---
Oh yes cause BHVR have a great track history of everything is working before it hits live right?
---
This being said, you could leave 3 of them corrupt for quite a bit I would imagine 
---
If you get puked on or get infected from a Gen, just get away from killer and then ignore it.  It does absolutely nothing to you outside of a health state.  Finish gens, then cleanse, rescue, and leave. 
---
Isnt that was the teaser trailer is for? And live streams they do? I would believe its just an advertisment so youll buy the new killer.
---
i bet they both use ds
---
Why are the generators sparking? Is this the work of an enemy stand!?
---
And how pathetic you can't even reply in the thread anymore now you're DMing me about this shit.
---
Don't even worry about it then.  Just work on gens.  Cleanse once doors are up or you have to go save someone whose time is about to run out. 
---
The truth is what it is, it doesn't have to be cool.  A lot of people are best served by hearing reality.
---
That’s my fetish 
---
Basically spamming the beginning of the mori animation over and over without actually filling the bar all the way up
---
Wait, you are the Bubba who just wants items am I right? 
---
tbh, it’s probably always better to buy a killer than to buy a survivor. Because with a killer you get a whole new character but when you play survivor it’s kind of just a reskin.
---
so this is king crimson's ability...
---
Seems like you're overreacting a bit to me. OP said that it would only be once they're in the "find help" stage, which takes quite a bit to get to without being picked up. Even killers that slug will EVENTUALLY (not ruining the viability of their strat) have to pick players up this way, I like the idea
---
went with the spirit, thank u for ur advice 
---
Only if they sit there....
---
Are we basing this off every killer having no add ons?
---
This is good lol
---
I'm pretty sure the changes were reverted.  if your talking about survivor pick up time
---
So first of all thanks @Audiopeaches for the support.  
---
Now to the loser who is being condescending , there is more meaning behind this tattoo then you will ever know.  You see it as a game logo, but to me it is much deeper then that.  
---
I have made friends that I have had for years that I have met playing this game, and not just friends that I get on Xbox or PS and talk to when I play, these people are my friends on facebook, we have each others numbers they know whats going on in my private life, people that care for me as much as I care for them in a genuine way.  And it was all because of this game.    
---
So if you must know that is why I got it, I have lots of memories from my 36 years of gaming, but this game is where I have made some REAL friends and that is why I got the tattoo.  Now you are dismissed.
---
As a survivor main, I feel like I never ever win on Swamp, especially against killers who have really good mobility.  There are maps that are disadvantageous for killers too though, so it balances out.
---
I think our asses hit the edge of the window before we fall, but we can't see it.
---
short poem
---
all good
---
Im fine with green to brown add-ons. But im mostly talking about no add ons.
---
Im just really frustraded that i cant make this dude work. Im not just here to just deny anything you say.
---
They do not care.
---
fixing freddy would be pretty easy too: Survivors cannot tell when they are being put into dream state and while they are in dream they are exhausted. there. A tier.
---
2019 seems close enough.
---
Damn I'll never get the 3rd one at this rate ;w;
---
Legion will anything but Frank’s mixtape is awful. 
---
Wraith is mindgames and if you don’t know how to lunge farther with him then there’s no reason to play him. 
---
Isn't she still basically 12 years old mentally though? Her mom died when she was young, leaving her completely on her own in the middle of the forest with no one else to teach her anything. She literally doesn't understand that you can't keep little girls chained in your basement without any sort of care without them dying. She's basically an absolute feral child with a soft spot for girls
---
I only really play killer so i can give insight only on that side but what I would do:
---
* Monstrous shrine, make people take longer to die in the basement (you don't want your bait to die quicker), and when someone is saved from the basement they suffer exhaustion.
---
* Unrelenting/Predator- its for new players, its fine.
---
* Dying light- its good enough that sometimes it gets ran and changes up the game a bit, but not good enough to be meta. Its fine.
---
* Third Seal- just make it not a hex. There, fixed.
---
* Overcharge- it has its niche uses. If anything it should make all failed skillchecks regress the gen more.
---
* Beast of Prey- it just removes the stain outright. Would be pretty good.
---
* Pop goes the weasel- very, very strong perk when the stars align. Just make it not have a time limit.
---
* PWYF- Its fine. If anything, make it so that losing stacks are harder. Maybe on a missed attack?
---
* Fire Up- give it a movement speed bonus. Nothing too big. 
---
They’d be somewhat fucked if the game reaches gate opening stage with remember me. 
---
That’d be terrible to play against. 
---
As a killer I'm fine with dcing long as it's because someone farmed them off hook or I'm farming and they don't want their time wasted.
---
I'm definitely not okay with someone representing the community dcing
---
Why? Let people with consoles the chance to get into this game. I really don't get people who say "MaKe ThIs GaMe eXcLuSive oThEr plaTfOrMs aRe sHit lmao"
---
It's okay, I had to do a triple take when I read your meme lol
---
I use the P3 face on occasion when I'm playing with other Quentins just so that we can distinguish each other.   
---
But still:  
---
Beanie&gt;P3 Face&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Default Face  
---
I am also the rare breed that prefers Baggy Quin
---
I see you've never met Mr. Wordwide Doctor where his Terror Radius covers 80% of the map at any given time
---
Freddy should be strong endgame. And it's not like awake survivors and hooks don't wake you up at that point.
---
I've never heard that suggestion before. Not a bad idea. The only problem I have currently have (which isn't really too big of a deal) is that I feel as though the fountain should only instaheal if the survivor was injured from the purge/sickness.
---
Devs are increasing the penalty for camping a hooked survivor. 
---
In current public branch, the killer loses points in the Chaser emblem for each second they're near a hook, I think exponentially as well. However, the value is so low that it is totally easy to ignore and continue to camp without penalty. 
---
The PTB increases this penalty, likely bugged to be far too harsh though as there have been people talking about killers getting all four survivors in a short time, yet black pipping. I also saw a screenshot posted on Reddit with Tru3 not getting anything in Chaser, so I put two and two together. 
---
Nope! I was surprised to find out. Stay tuned 
---
this just sounds fucking hilarious, especially if the game glitches for mori'ying
---
if a survivor cannot tell when they are falling asleep, they wouldn't really want to stay in the lullaby. Sure they might get more of the gen done, but the risk of getting pulled off might help deter them.
---
The problem is being bored because the killer refuses to hook you, not because he can't find you.
---
Having two people downed at a time has nothing to do with being dumb or not, if you're an SWF 4 man, sure "git gud stoopid", but when you're all randoms? How does this even make sense?
---
Then what would your idea be? Because you haven’t suggested any. My drawbacks are both easily solved by pairing with another add on. That’s how most of them work.
---
You can’t really call for a change without suggesting your own ideas 
---
Flashlights aren't some Satanic Stick. If you see a guy with a flashlight, be cautious when you pick someone up. Face the wall as you pick up a survivor, or you can pretend you're gonna pick them up to bait the flashlight user into showing themself. If you really need to hook someone, quickly change directions to lower the chances of getting blinded. 
---
I really do not see a problem denying survivor perks. Nothing should be 100% guaranteed. Makes people think about their build more.
---
\*killer stumbles down stairs
---
(rapid table smacking)
---
I think you emptied your luck for the next... I dunno... twenty years?
---
I was looting the basement there (which seems darker than the other basements) and didn't notice the pig crept up behind me. I turned around and fucking SCREAMED. Then she oneshot me with haunted grounds
---
I would like to point out the spelling error it's thicc
---
anyone wanna do some swf?
---
Well one killer has to be shite .. I don’t mind it to be Ding Dong
---
If he can get everyone late game, it’s basically game over. 
---
Also, that indirectly buffs noed. Nobody wants that. 
---
At least 1 survivor is usually dead come end game. 
---
Sometimes it’s because of bad ping, get over yourself guy!
---
My favorite build is pretty fun and can do quite alot in most situation. Lithe, Prove Thy Self, Adrenaline / Well Make It / Alert. The build allows you ability to get generators down quickly while giving the chance for looping and map awareness to plan what to do next. The Adrenaline / Well Make It is basically if you are feeling courageous or wanting to stick more to looping and gens.
---
when I play Nurse and I see someone burn the meat plant offering I'm just like "ah man you're gonna regret that"
---
I was thinking to roast some lamb.. have to hook it first and bleed it out
---
Yeah but I can't really think of any killer power denying perks without add-ons. But maybe I'm wrong and it's just alcohol speaking here.
---
It's just a hatless Bill, but yeah, definitely prefer the L4D look of the icons
---
There is an option.. called disconnect
---
Diversion quick and quiet dead hard iron will/urban/adrenaline.
---
Fucking love pebble, q and q as I’m often low rank as I don’t play frequently, dead hard as fookin dead ard and then either urban iron or adrenaline based on how I’m feeling 
---
I don't think so. Being put to sleep needs to be a definitive statement, not a warning or a maybe.
---
That's a tough one...
---
Inb4 : "NOED != Decisive".
---
OP makes good points. Noed boring af.
---
What’s worse is baby-killers who take myers AND noed as if the exposed status effect didn’t happen often enough
---
Ever considered that maybe it's meant for a different situation than you want to use it?
---
An extra life is VERY good, and thus hard to get.
---
Imagine if Pop goes the Weasel only triggered once the gens we're done, but let the killer reset one fully?
---
I feel as the perk is intended for newer players.
---
Yea
---
I’m 
---
If you get unhooked in front of the Killer then sorry but too bad. Obviously it's not your fault, it's your teammate's, but you don't deserve to escape.
---
Diversion, Urban Evasion, Stakeout, and the 4th perk cycles between (Self Care, Technician, &amp; Iron Will).
---
People really underrate the pebble.  It’s more than just a meme, it is an incredibly niche but genuinely useful tool that can and will save lives so long as you know when to use it and don’t overplay your hand.  Too many people take it, then just throw it directly into the killer’s face for the memes and complain that diversion sucks.  It’s true, you basically have to build your entire kit around the pebble, but that doesn’t make it instantly trash tier.  You also have to build your entire kit around Lithe and Monitor &amp; Abuse, yet both perks see regular usage and players who swear by them.
---
I would absolutely love this. If it worked like kill your friends you could play around with all the ingame perks and play with build ideas that you could use in the main game. 
---
Also would work as practice for new killers before they get into the actual game.
---
Only issue is that I believe devs would have a hard time coding bots to do loops properly and to understand how efficient loops are with randomised maps. Would be very interesting to body block a bot and see how it reacts.
---
Amazing suggestion.
---
I ran qq, dance with me, head on, and iron will. Whenever I dashed out of a locker and stunned them I left no scratch marks and they were confused where I went.
---
It should cause exhaustion after use but it should ignore exhaustion when you use it. Like adrenaline.
---
Well that's kinda the mindgame isn't it? You hear the lullaby and you don't know if he got you, when he got you, if he is still around, etc.
---
It would make the game a lot spookier to play i feel. Just not being able to reliably tell exactly how long you have before you fall asleep with be a massive buff.
---
Then Micheal needs to tap his heels while saying “There’s no place like home” in heavy breathing.
---
Up again, now with Billy.
---
I feel it's kinda pointless to reupload it considering I wasn't even the first one to upload it but my brother convinced me to upload it anyway so here it is, I guess.
---
It's a great idea. Let's cross our fingers
---
I fail to see how being different from other killers would be a bad thing.
---
Slugging can't really hold the game hostage can it? It's on a timer.
---
Considerably easier Killer games now.  There's been a series of killer buffs and survivor nerfs over the last 8 months or so that really helped balance the games for killer.  Like others said removal of the pallet vacuum was the biggest thing, they can't make nearly the amount of loops that they used to.  Most buildings have been reworked and window spawns were significantly weakened.  Brand New Parts, gone.  Decisive about to be gone.  Basically if you play well the game is yours to win or lose.
---
They don't leave because od bad ping. Id you had bad ping you would quit instantly and not wait for 3 minutes!
---
First off the comments are sorted by popularity so I can’t find your post at all. Secondly you sound like a douche so I don’t really care anymore bye :)

Also no more instablinds

---
Freddy i feel is so weak him ignoring perks could be alright. I could be wrong too, freddy is such a dumpster fire im honestly not too sure if he can even be fixed.
---
Teamwork isn't being discouraged. It's part of one killer's power using that to their advantage.
---
I HATE the swamp, claudette has active Camo  there so shes invisible, they need to make a bush hog offering or a weed wacker addon for that map and Yamaoka Estate, friggin weeds are taller than I am
---
There's making it harder then there's making it impossible and currently in the PTB it's impossible to sufficiently rank up
---
Hes personally my favorite killer. If you play him smartly with the relatively recent buff he's gotten (a few months back i think) its easier than ever to jit someone out of invisibility. Then go invisible again and mindgame the injured surv. Its fairly easy to make them think they lost you/you gave up then you can down them.
---
I want a pipping system that reflects actual skill and a rank system that allows for fair and balanced games. If people are depipping when they should be safety or regular pipping their rank will not be accurate and the rank system will be ineffective and creating balanced games...which is what it should be doing.
---
It's highly frustrating to play an excellent game and depip. It doesn't create any incentive to rank up and makes people less likely to play the game because their hard work is not being acknowledged.
---
As for creating longer queues and less enjoyable games? Queues are longer, but not by much. I have to completely disagree with "less enjoyable matches" when everyone is playing efficiently and doing their best it creates a lot of competition and makes games far more satisfying than if they were one-sided. I love games where everyone's giving their all, even if I die or don't kill anyone. It's just that current ranking systems fail to consistently offer these games due to the variation in skill levels
---
Could be the bright ass hair, makes it a lot easier to spotem 
---
&gt;Having to go around the map and do 5 totems is real tedious
---
Translation: I don't want to have to spend any more time off gens than is absolutely necessary, killer perks be damned.
---
10/10
---
Well at least no one wants him removed from the game (not looking at legion at all)
---
I guess they should just rework him entirely, but that's a lot of work.
---
People say there are many but never list them
---
What're you, 60? Are all tattoos supposed to have this deep rooted meaning and philosophy behind them or something? People get tattoos just because they like the visuals of it.
---
Most jobs allow tattoos now and there's tons of people who have them, this isn't the 50's anymore my dude.
---
Look crazy good
---
Then what is the point of the ptb? 
---
Oh, there's 2? The one in the top left corner, sorry for late repsonse, had no internet, don't ask
---
This has been going on since the beginning. Its the state of the massive fucking grind. Embrace it, it will make your life easier.
---
At higher ranks survivors are more efficient with loops, totem spots and hitting great skill checks. While it’s not required a killer can with without slugging. But against a good team chase hit chase hit hook takes a long time, which could be a gen or two. At lower ranks slugging isn’t needed at all as chases don’t last long at all. However every killer wins due to noed there. Basically slugging is really good in high ranks due to how quick the game goes. 
---
She seems pretty damn solid, doesn’t have anything that warrants nerfs. She doesn’t seem to be uber top tier, by that fact alone she is fine. If she is on Spirit/Nurse tier, fine. More good killers is good. No reason to change or ruin that. 
---
Don’t even touch her movement speed at all, she is fine. She does not need to be faster/slower during anything. 
---
Your are correct she had reduced terror radius, no directional phasing sound, no phasing sound when survivor is in terror radius, and prayer beads changed to remove phasing sound
---
Yea, I dont think noed is *that* bad but it is a very uninspired perk. For me the problem mainly is you don't know it's there until it's too late. I think at the minimum if they added a hex debuff at the start of the match you would at least know it's there and can hunt down dull totems or be prepared when the last gen pops.
---
To see how well she performs, which is pretty good! Not game breakingly good, but good. 
---
....hence why they want to hold a PTB, because having something screw up in the PTB is miles better than having something screw up in the live release.
---
They don't mind sitting and holding a button on generators for 80 seconds but 14 seconds on a totem is just too much all of a sudden
---
lmfao
---
like can they be more transparent?
---
Your comment is assuming I care about how high my rank is, that is not even remotely close to what I'm arguing.
---
My argument is that the PTB ranking system **fixes nothing**. This is not a defense of the current ranking system or past ones. It is saying that implementing the new one will do nothing except cause frustration, stagnation, and disruption to normal gameplay.
---
The system implemented in PTB, instead of fixing things, encourages bad behavior and holds survivors and killers to impossible standards. It does not effectively rank people.
---
I care about rank because it *should* organize people into similar skill levels so they have fair games. As of now, it doesn't so I don't really care what rank I'm at. I don't like the PTB change because it **DOESN'T FIX ANYTHING**. People will still be ranked together who are not at the same skill level.
---
I don't really care if I'm in a "high rank" what I care about is being fairly evaluated so that I can have games with people who are at my skill level even if that means I will be ranked lower. I also care about having diverse and fun games, and that includes having mories. If you're going to discourage mories, why even have them? They're cool! I love mories even when I play survivor.
---
Again **I DO NOT CARE ABOUT BEING IN A HIGH RANK** I care about **BEING RANKED FAIRLY** which this system does not do. That's why I don't like it.
---
Let's assume we're talking about solo and not a commando squadette. 
---
Killer always puts pressure on survivors, if thy is not then shall not complain about gen rushing. 
---
A bunch of stranger survivor will first and foremost try to secure initial two generators so worst case scenario it's the hatch (highly dependent on the agenda, this is assuming escape is the priority)
---
At this point in the game the killer secured 2-4 hooks and broke 4-5 pallets (numbers based on my average games) assuming Ruin is not at play. 
---
1 or 2 survivors are on their last hook, the priority shifts to generators and stealth in order to increase chances of escape. 
---
It's the end game, survivors were hooked 3-6 times, half of the maps pallets worth are gone. 
---
Assuming all survivors managed to get to the end game. One survivor is being chased, the last totem is somewhere hidden between a wall and a fireplace. 
---
That survivor gone down and the rest nuts through the exit because a stranger can go and piss right off. 
---
All the effort went to shit because of one 'balanced' (sarcasm) perk.
---
I was very confused how some guy squeezed in that tiny of a space to point out your tattoo at first...
---
As far as I know there is no confirmation. Hopefully they will make changes so that it's harder to pip but still fair
---
Exactly. "BuT mUh GeNeRaToRs" just do the damn totems or you don't have any right to complain about NOED. Survivors just want to slam out gens without any punishments for it, and that's not happening.
---
Which is why it's not bad for DL
---
Fortnite can do it because it's built on a nicely tuned code with a bigger dev team, a bigger budget, and arguably being one of the most popular games right (which increases revenue). Again, DBD can't do it because the code is a mess and they're in the progress of fixing it.
---
While we're comparing games, Overwatch has their PTR only on PCs.
---
I run Deliverance/Hope/Bond/Adrenaline on my main
---
McClean said, about a month ago, that it's nearly done. I imagine it'll be in the mid-chapter patch.
---
I think it's fixed now. Thanks again
---
Basically:
---
"Now i'm not racist, but...
---
all toxic killers speak spanish."
---
I couldn't see the generator number. Did you complete it?
---
Yeah man, a shitty toolbox and a shitty medkit, take your pick
---
I, a professional Minecraft Linguist, have found some errors in your comment and have recrafted it. 
---
 &gt;yeah man, a shitty toolChest and a shitty medkit, take your pick
---
It's. The. First. Post. In. The. Thread. As in THE ORIGINAL POST. 
---
Yes, I look like a douche because you spoke out of ignorance and have too much who to accept that. Sounds about right. Lmao
---
My thread didn't really need you. Have a good one. 
---
How tf is he godly at tunneling. 
---
Oh yes were just gonna ignore the months of game breaking bugs that plague the game after the new patches hit live? Or the fact that resort was disabled for weeks with the new dlc? Or the infamouse SB wraith glitch? Or the multiple game crashing bugs in the game that were there in the PTB? Everythign that screws up in ptb does in live.

*Minecraft drinking noises*

Self care, We'll Make it, We're Gonna Live Forever, Dead Hard
---
For farming blood points. I have a lot of survivors to level.
---
For me I like to run lithe, dance with me, lightweight and alert/adrenaline, but since lithe is actually getting a buff allowing it to activate out of chase I might swap one of them out for quick and quiet. 
---
That's on the survivors for not being altruistic or just not cleansing the totem. And also, gen rushing=/= NOED. The former is a problem, the latter is not. Besides, it's not like good killers don't get genrushed anyway, so map pressure is moot.
---
Awesome
---
No she did not, she just went there to put graffiti on it, it had burned down lonnggg before.
---
M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist: killer hits Dwight but steps in his own trap.
---
Wait what? Is it a set pattern?
---
I personally love wraith! Admittedly he’s not as meta as billy or another nurse but I feel he’s still very under rated. It’s so satisfying to sneak up on someone, body block the loop, and smack them as they try to go for said loop! Probably an unpopular opinion but if the wraith had his cloaked speed buffed he could be the new billy
---
They might have only lowered it for the Wraith since cloaked stalking doesn't count as a chase
---
It takes 3 seconds for it to become avaliable to you. You can't use it in a chase without getting pulled out of the locker so no, it really wouldn't become anywhere as strong as old DS.
---
I'm not really sure what to say to this. Like yeah sometimes your game doesn't go well for you. Toughen up, buttercup
---
For every map, there's a few elements that stay the same. Lots of the bigger structures follow a pattern (some maps more than others) and only differ in the placement of pallets and which windows are open.
---
Well ............ Lot of people dont like the game ? Wtf ? 
---
"Easy to implement"? Decent AI is far from easy. I don't think you know what you're talking about.
---
Quake was my favourite game in ‘96 I haven’t but I would get it tattooed I’ve thought about it every few years just haven’t pulled the trigger. 
---
They fact that simply ducking is enough to go invisible to killers upsets me. 
---
Honestly I think they put it how they intended to but they didn’t realize how bad it is
---
KEKKA DEKA DA
---
All just pixels 
---
Good bot
---
Even the nurse has harsh cool downs for missing blinks and using m1 though. 
---
And people playing Legion affect me. Still a waste of my time, I m just gonna head to the next one. Ona a side note, my comment being negative shows the hypocrisy of some people here.
---
Oh it was and it did; they fell faster than I did, so their chest and face basically slid down the knife as I stabbed them.
---
I kinda wish I'd been the Survivor, because I'm curious whether their camera stayed focused on them or me.
---
*ZA WARUDO!*
---
this is so fucking good
---
Playing with 3 perks all game. 2 once they find ruin. The only thing wrong with ruin is it should tell survivors they’re exposed. Pretty balanced otherwise, like it or not 
---
Indeed. 
---
This guy looks like a meg main
---
Balanced, hope, wake up, adrenaline. All endgame.
---
Seriously, i say in the lobby chat that i got a looter build, i point and t-bag at em furiously if they start to open a chest but i guess they're just happy with their brown medkit ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
^(at least a brown medkit i looted would have add ons...)
---
....you expected someone to not be mad after you did something shitty to them?
---
I'm thinking of Master Chief at the beginning of the High Charity scene in Halo 2 here...
---
Yo, I scrolled down for like a second and noped out of there.
