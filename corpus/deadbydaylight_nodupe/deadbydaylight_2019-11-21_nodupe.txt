I mean, it always has been since the rework. It's one of the best perk combinations for most M1 killers.
---
---
---
That's how more content works, as more content gets released some are stronger (Ghostface, Spirit, Huntress, Nurse) and some are weaker (Legion, Doctor, Leathercace, Clown). Due to this power creep is near inevitable unless the balance team is top notch, which this one sadly isnt.
---
The drawing is great for sure but she has that slutty look all around.
---
...noone told me about the beast of prey thing
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
ive been trying to follow other peoples advice instead of my own invention. I used to use Beast of Prey all the time, but everyone told me it sucked....
---
Oh shoot really? So a Borrowed Time receptor gets hit, and if I turn on Night Shroud, it goes down?
---
So it's only fixed in PTB, not live yet?
---
*Looks at Ash* This is Brilliant
---
*Looks at Ace* But I like THIS.
---
I think that snowball will make him slightly worse than Ghostface, but still high tier
---
I‚Äôm thinking the reason Legion got nerfs with the QoL changes is because the devs knew this would be a spicy combo and had to balance it out. I‚Äôll miss STBFL god Legion, but I‚Äôm actually excited to play him now.
---
We just know that we‚Äôre not gonna *get* those buffs. It‚Äôs gonna be the major nerf coming our way, and probably even more to compensate for this PTB mess.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Nemesis isn‚Äôt reliable activation though. It doesn‚Äôt work on a survivor who‚Äôs already your obsession and whether a survivor stuns you is largely out of your hands. If survivors don‚Äôt want to stun a killer, they don‚Äôt have to.
---
You don‚Äôt have many games where you don‚Äôt get stunned because there isn‚Äôt a perk that obliviates survivors when a non obsession stuns. Bet that would change if you ran Nemesis Legion. It‚Äôs called adaptation.
---
Nothing from the PTB carries over
---
Basically you do your initial feral frenzy hit and the heartbeat happens since if you already have bloodlust, you just landed a hit and will now lose it and regain your terror radius. There shouldn't be a scenario that you can't use killer instinct with beast of prey. 
---
If you use something like Dark Devotion and hit your obsession first then killer instinct is based around your obsession's terror radius while active so you might not see it highlight on a survivor further away from the obsession, but right next to you if you went opposite directions for example.
---
Well I mean in his bio it did say that he designed  covers for hard rock bands. So I feel like he would have that as his chase music. Plus if they devs were  lasy they can just use legion's theme and change it a bit.
---
üòê
---
Literally on the last second. Nice one.
---
Yes.
---
He forgot to rip out the tounge
---
BBQ does not need a nerf. It grants extra BP, and it gives some helpful info. This info is HELPFUL, but it isn't game breaking.
---
Wouldn't suit his palate
---
for some reason everyone on console is playing either ghostface or the demogorgon. it‚Äôs pretty annoying so they probably left when they saw it was another ghostface
---
Its game breaking
---
This wasn‚Äôt your fault, Jake completely disengaged in actual gameplay that‚Äôs on him
---
Laughed more than I should of
---
That‚Äôs weird, I just wanted to be a toxic basement dweller for a match
---
Okay, how so?
---
Because nobody here is going to agree to that. If that is game breaking, so is Kindred.
---
this happens to me a lot too. the best advice i could give is to be immersed for the first 30 seconds or so to find out where he/she is. they‚Äôll patrol the nearest generators and then just leave since they assume survivors are elsewhere. if you‚Äôre working on the gen solo you can usually get about halfway progress before they come back!
---
Because you were a killer &amp; you tried to kill them. You‚Äôre supposed to leave them alone &amp; let them do gens in peace.
---
God why did they remove this from Netflix
---
The only reason I play legion is farming bloodpoints and trying out fun builds
---
No it‚Äôs on the PC. Hopefully the cross platforms deal will rectify the issue but I‚Äôm not too hopeful
---
If you're running and get hit you might get out in time, but otherwise it's like a faster, thinner, cannibal tantrum
---
Feng Min ahegao?
---
I might still main her later. Dunno, undecided.

Oh yeah sorry I forgot rule #5542

What a ride it was
---
Lmao I had that happen in a shitshow game. Got hooked and immediately started yoinking, somehow yoinked myself off. Killer was still nearby, died anyway
---
The Christmas jumper Susie is absolutely precious and my man Bill is finally getting a new cosmetic! Hope this could mean more in the future. :0
---
Thats why i dont want to run the damn perk. Its too cheesy and really annoying for the killer.
---
Kindred is find object sucks ass. And everyone's wrong it basically tells you where everyone is that's broken.
---
If every killer uses it because its that good. Its broken. And it's that good it's used every game
---
so for why isnt jackie chan the survivor?
---
Considering they were nerfing the 'mending' time, I see little reason to want them to remove this.
---
Keep it until we can get a proper buff/fix for Legion.
---
Pretty sure that one is broken right now.
---
A less gory wraith could also use his bell. Kickthe survivor so he's sitting down Place the bell over their head and clang it a couple times the survivor goes invisible, screams but is cut short, wraith clangs it a couple times and the survivor reappears dead. 
---
It uses his mystical bell that we don't know much, and what happens to others who try to use it,  and I like my horror to have a couple open ended questions. What happens when they
---
thanks for the advice!
---
The one time i tries full sfw was me and the boys running adept david.
---
I was up against infinite freddy.
---
Oh the huntress main in me is pleased also may start playing dwight for that eyesore of a outfit, definitely smart to wear considering itll stand out wonderfully for the killer.
---
That is the complete opposite of what villain means.
---
 (in a film, novel, or play) a character whose evil actions or motives are important to the plot.
---
Rule #5542 is very important. No but seriously. If it‚Äôs a killer some people don‚Äôt enjoy playing against, it was either because of that or simply because it didn‚Äôt go their way lol
---
Demogorgon has been out for less than 3 months. Bubba has been out for well over a year...
---
Oh ok, I‚Äôll be sure to add photos of more clear correlations for the air heads out there
---
I always do that as ghost face
---
Right!?!?
---
The hag covers the Blair Witch base... add Heather as a survivor maybe but that's about as far as you can go.
---
It did, but the Legion bullshit is even worse. As a killer I can make the secession not to chase someone and instead force them to stop playing like a little bitch through forcing them to be altruistic. As a survivor there‚Äôs shit all I can do to stop the killer from getting a free down on me while I have a timer on my head. Obvious imbalance here
---
Ds isn‚Äôt good at all, literally if you know someone is running it. You can literally not pick him up after tunneling and make the perk useless
---
A focused focuser that focuses on focusing.
---
It's a design problem. The devs have created two states that persist for a long time and during which you can't do anything (hooked and slugged, and killing yourself trying to Kobe, struggling, or crawling around at pathetic speeds barely constitute input). They've also given very good reasons for players to be left in these states for extended periods.
---
No flashlight or add one blind faster anymore, just for brightness, duration, range and width.
---
One you aim the flashlight at the killer‚Äôs face long enough You should get the ‚ÄúKiller Blind‚Äù scoring event.
---
Like claudette mains need anymore help haha
---
You can essentially play however you wish nothing you listed is going to get you banned from the game in any way, but one could be seen negatively by the community if that's something you care about.
---
One thing I would recommend doing is giving the survivor role a good few attempts. Not only will you learn ways to counter survivors as a killer (places to hide, things to watch for), but you'll also get a good sense of how you feel comfortable playing. I split my playtime pretty evenly, and I've made it my own rule not to play in a way that would make me feel miserable if I were my opponent. I might not win every game as a result, but that's okay by me.
---
The thing that was illegal was premeditated armed assault. Again trying to twist my words. 
---
The pressure you applied was a loaded statement. That if not addressed as you so kindly suggested. I would have been essentially accepting my stance as equivalent to the support of a criminal activity.
---
Forgive me for finding a verbal environment like that to be hostile with landmines like that on the floor.

---
They can't really kill the perk can they other wise it won't be as intended for Oni.
---
shorter cooldown after a normal hit, which will no longer work with feral frenzy and won't give stacks anymore. sad times.
---
Do most survivors believe that the only way to loop a killer is by using pallets? Because there are plenty of loops that the game provides on most maps that don't require the use of pallets. This seems like it'll help low rank killers more than in higher ranks.
---
Also, can't you break blood lust by stopping for a second or at least walking for a moment then going back to running?
---
Besides the meme, wtf is the context to whatever the hell this is? üòÇ
---
KILLER RAN RUIN SO BY THE TIME HE GOT ALL OF US THERE WERE ONLY TWO GENS DONE AND HE SPENT THAT TIME BUILDING TO TIER 3. I‚ÄôM NOT SAYING SYRINGE AND BL AREN‚ÄôT OP, ALL I‚ÄôM SAYING IS WE DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL AND THERE‚ÄôS NOT A LOT OF COUNTERPLAY FOR A BUILD LIKE THAT
---
Well, this is actual Capcom, right? I don't anticipate any legal troubles intervening this time, but a lot of people are whining that it's not RE3 remake or that it's like or unlike Outbreak (yes, people are complaining about both).
---
Yes, and this is fantastic
---
wow, I love it !
---
Just make the photos clearly related to dbd, a rule I use is, if it the title or a comment has to explain it, it‚Äôs bad
---
Once I was playing a tight game with a Meg (or a Kate) and a Jeff. I killed the girl after injuring Jeffy, didn‚Äôt see the hatch nearby. So I patrolled around him unknowingly, heard his groans and got near him just as it opened. Downed him right as it opened, and shut it before he got in. Either not quick enough reactions or the blood cleansing and shutting it is quicker than down animation and jumping in.
---
One meme to rule them all.
---
Persistent sum bitch lol
---
You give the Devs too much credit. They clearly had no idea what they were doing or that this would even be a thing. This is just another quirk that the community has to find for them so they can fix it. As lazy as the devs are old legion was killing their game. They would never let something similar to old legion reach the live servers ever again. They'll fix this and Legion will be nerfed into being completely unviable with no STBFL to make him viable.
---
I mean after getting them once with it they just need to throw the pallet a bit sooner just like when a killer gets you with they enduring spirit fury combo, but since its legion survivors will bitch about it like always
---
Thats sounds terrible
---
How you gettin' rituals done in the PTB ...
---
We've come to a point where perks are only good with previous killers and are good in combos. 
---
Unlike the old days where they were god tier by themselves. Most of the new perks are useless and have no creativity to them unless of course you play around instead of looking just as it is.
---
I'm gonna give you an up vote. The difference in attitude from green to purple to red is insane... I always tend to depip to green/purple if poss as the play style is more causal and people dont send you shitty DMs if you didnt play how they wanted you to play.
---
Sorry I escaped while you were on hook but noed was in play and the killer was up my butt... you woulda done the same!
---
That sweet frame rate I sometimes miss PC but my friends are on console.
---
Idk but Disney + has an opportunity here
---
Do sweaters cost Auric Cells?
---
Dude its a meme. This is gonna happen.
---
I use the ghost face one that blocks gens when you carry someone! I love it!
---
Feral Frenzy should shut off after a single hit to anybody, but retain its current progress, that way the survivor still gets distance, but Legion can still rush up if they follow the way they ran and down them with Feral. I‚Äôve only downed someone with deep once, and more downed them by rushing up to them, shutting it off, and following them
---
The key word in the second definition is especially. I can assure you you've been creating a hostile environment for me.
---
I think you mean uploading
---
No but every killer should be at least myers level.
---
As did i, lol

I just hope at the very least we get more "survivorfaces" based on the non-licensed people.  That said, there are definitely legitimate costume options for Bubba in the various movies, they just need to make it happen.
---
The point is it‚Äôs random. If you want to get rid of it, best idea is to get T3 and wait more
---
Do you actually have to do 100% of the gen by yourself or just pop 3 gens?
---
literally how do you escape a killer that can fast vault windows without a stun
---
Yeah, swf can suck really hard. I understand most people are just trying to have fun, but the toxic ones really ruin the game for everyone. Just something we have to deal with I guess
---
But he does clean blood off his weapon when he hits an already injured survivor?
---
You can only chase one person at a time and as soon as you break chase that survivor if they are worth anything will get right back on a gen gens go way to fast when they actually do them and if you think otherwise your delusional
---
Man, I hate on the devs so much I expect to be banned from the subreddit half the time. Of course they're going to nerf Legion (in general) into the ground over this perk that only makes them OP at tunnelling because one of the base mechanics is poorly-implemented. They're just also a trainwreck now, so I'm calling them out on that now.
---
I feel like they have ONE competent person they're starting to listen to, though. The guy who redesigned Freddy's kit and stopped them from gutting Spirit with an awful rework/overnerf. It's just a matter of how much s/he gets to say.
---
Last years you could get with 4,800 shards I believe ? So probably not just .
---
Nemesis works on Legion
---
I smell more nerfs. If they really give him more nerfs after this, they either need to rework him or just delete him. People only play him because he looks cool or for a meme anyway.
---
Simple: Adrenaline, dead hard, self care ( if you want) or Bond and decisive strike. Pls do do this
---
but Freddy's Rework turned him into an A Tier Killer.  Bubba is still in the bottoms
---
I'd argue that the new method would be killing yourself on hook. The devs can't force people to play something unfun. Yeah, it sucks to have to suffer through a 3 man game against a confident killer. But at the end of the day they're just gonna find new ways to exit the game early.
---
Are the legion masks legit paper mache? That's so... Cute?
---
Freddy OP
---
Well yeah, map control will be average in 99% of games; but we‚Äôre talking about a 4-man no mither in which case his ability will be available quite often meaning he has a lot of mobility
---
shut yo pinnochio  steve lovin ass up
---
Sounds like the shortest game ever lol
---
Really?
---
Shut the fuck up you fucking idiot
---
Or just change deep wound to act like madness 3. It wont put you into the dying state, but you cant do anything useful until you mend.
---
Still better than Monstrous Shrine and Boil over.
---
agreed
---
It was doing that for me too but seems to be working again as of a second ago.
---
The basic "tryhard" perks, adrenaline, DS, BL or whatever exhaustion perk u want, and whatever you want for the fourth! I usually run spine chill :)
---
There are a lot of downsides to this mistake. For starters the devs are gonna use this mistake (their fault) to buff borrowed time. They're probably gonna nerf the Legion another 20 times just for good measure. To top it all off this perk is gonna get nerfed and it just lost us the chance to get the STBFL synergy back.
---
Had it too but it's fixed now
---
For one, Xbox?
---
Two, KYF? 
---
If you said yes for both then you need to friend the host. I don‚Äôt know if it affects other platforms, but at least Xbox
---
Because I lost a match to him!
---
So then you just get bloodlusted down... it‚Äôs not the same thing. And killers bitch bitch just as much as survivors
---
Does Huntress not use an axe in her lore?
---
I've been taking solidarity recently, when in a 3 person healing party its so funny to see peoples reactions while trying to heal you but you already are at full health after healing both of them
---
But it also makes me stubbornly insistent on healing them first if I just came off hook
---
I feel like Dwights would be nursery rhymes and baby music.
---
no love for my boi quentin pff
---
I dont dc but I will suicide for GF. Its just not fun to vs. I play enough games Id rather just move on to the next round.
---
Jinjyo ni shoubu!
---
did that for me but now it's workin
---
Isn‚Äôt the half minute specific to blinds or stuns?
---
we could get a hand if we had Kira Yoshikage as a killer lmao
---
The Oni is billy if billy needed gas to power his chainsaw
---
–°—É–∫–∞
---
I mean if the killer has to bloodlust to take you down arent you doing a good job in wasting his time? the point isnt to not get downed its to waste as much of his time as posible while your teammates work the gens
---
Link to repost? Someone above mistook a different meme with the same format as a repost
---
Anyone who plays GF is only here for cheap wins I dont mind suiciding to let them have it
---
yeah but we all know survivors gonna bitch about it
---
It's probably already happened over there at r/dbdgonewild
---
its "funny" not "fun e"
---
Bond... is... your... friend.
---
For players who screw me over bond becomes a perk less about your allies safety and more about screwing over the people who screw you over. üëç
---
He couldn't have opened them, he closed hatch.
---
I can. If you're being looped to death - you're doing it wrong. Look how OfTofu, Monto and Otzdarva play at higher ranks, you can learn a lot of tricks from them.
---
Hopefully they just change deep wound to pause while within a set range of the killer, rather than the terror radius. There's no particular reason it has to be tied to radius, yes it gives away stealth killers but it's infrequent enough that I don't think it'd matter.
---
typical meta adrenaline/deadhard/decisive/borrowed time but dont be that dude that sucks the fun out of someone's days or the community alone it's already shitty enough
---
Billy before they locked him away
---
SC, Deliverance, Head On/Spine Chill, DS. Only use that specific build though if everyone has a trend of being selfish. Before the hate rains, Self is really efficient if you recently got unhooked and the unhooker is hooked. I got saved by a Nea that way. My new with the new perks would be Empathy, the wiggle Yui one, the pallet Yui one, and DS. Mostly just so I can find injured boys if I‚Äôm injured so we both get healed, wiggle so I can bodyblock and help, pallet so I can repeat loops, and DS because y tf not.

Not another Legion cosplayer...
---
Oh my god I legit saw the survivor portion of this. You both recorded it
---
you're telling me something that has absolutely zero counterplay was something people complained about? say it aint so!
---
and that is exactly why it probably wont make it to live in its current incarnation - I think its even a little bit delusional when people think the devs would allow people to play like this again, considering it was never how legion was intended to be played.
---
When you want him to hit you out the gate but it's tombstone Myers.
---
It was designed around survivors not having voice comms. It was balanced around survivors having voice comms.
---
Why do you think there are so many incredibly effective avenues for killers to slow gen progression or locate survivors that are perk based?
---
I still don't get it, help
---
How is BBQ game ruining? It's easily countered.
---
Then the survivor just DCs
---
There's no voice chat anywhere. PC has pre and post-game text chat, but no voice chat.
---
I personally would run those perks, but to be honest they are \*mostly\* very situational, and I'd prefer using other builds when I play. It'd still be fun to try this out though.

---
I mean even if it has counter play, anyone with some common sense should understand that Legion shouldn't able to drain your timer while still fully chasing you.
---
At this point they need to just nuke Legion. Start from scratch. It was a half assed effort but it's clear this Deep Wounds shot is just fundamentally incompatible with the game.
---
uh no.
---
I meant like some editing, or a meme caption. Not just sticking a ton of of ‚ÄúOni dbd‚Äù on it
---
I mean, it's the exact same situation if a survivor gets BMd and then DC. If you spend the game doing optimal loops is one thing,they DC that's on them, but if you're runnin around with your purple flashlight and meta perks fishing for some killer rage you're also a part of the problem. Just sayin.
---
Yeah I was thinking the same thing
---
It's ok, I was a min Main but I am thiiiiinking on switching to yui depending on cosmetics
---
Lol I was waiting for someone to make this from that comment on another post
---
Then you get hit though since they have bloodlust
---
Not your problem. Optimization doesn't mean being fair whenever possible, but figuring out how unfair the mechanics allow you to be and utilizing that to it's fullest extent.
---
But he can be Dwightface if you grind hard enough.

"Nerf" is a strong word. She's still going to be very viable and top tier. People are proving that on the PTB

I do feel like you have a point. While I don't want to go back to the old legion, as he was way too easy to exploit, he was kind of fun to play back then. I tried playing legion again quite recently and he is so boring, his movement speed increase during frenzy is barely noticable and whenever I use his power, it feels more like it's hurting me than it feels like it's doing me good.
---
In my eyes, Pegion is the most horing killer in the game and the weakest killer in the game (yes, even weaker than Bubba)
---
Imma object to your assumption that Billy falls apart in Hawkins. That map is 90% unsafe pallets for easy saw-downs.
---
Bunny Feng when

Whenever I play SWF and my friends are like "There's ruin!" I want to die irl because I know those fucks aren't on gens anymore.

I‚Äôm u/Eater_Of_Tacos, and I approve this message

---
I clancher my sas at that time Holy shit
---
Oh yeah, was happening to me too. I guess it stopped now tho.
---
Ya this is really annoying. I‚Äôve just gotten back into this game after like a year of being away and it deranged me all the way down to rank 18 for killer. I‚Äôve been forced to main survivor now because matches take so long to find.
---
Apparently dying once to some guys messing around qualifies this as "the most toxic game ever".
---
Holy fuck you people have thin skin.
---
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE MULTIPLE RIFT CHALLENGES CONCURRENTLY. AT LEAST HAVE 2 SELECTABLE AT A TIME. 
---
ALSO CHARMS ARE PRETTY LAME FOR SURVIVORS. BETTER RIFT ITEMS ARE NEEDED.
---
I'm having the exact same issue. I don't know what can be done, no one seems to know.
---
There are plenty of loops that can pop up will make this more of a high vs low skill. Again, survivors can spend a minute + looping around shack against a lot of killers. There is also the chance for large LT walls, window vault setups, Iron Works window near infinite loop, Haddonfield will still be busted, etc. If anything, this breaks some loops or some extended loops on certain maps. Survivors can get screwed over by RNG on maps, but that balances out in my eyes because killers can get equally as screwed.
---
I had this problem yesterday as well.
---
Have you tried power-cycling the console itself? That fixed it for me
---
If I'm being honest, his weak early game(no power until he hits 2 survivors or hits 1 survivor and greedily licks up all the blood like a cumdump) makes up for the fact he can pull off some nasty shit like this.  He has to work hard to get what Billy has in his basekit and even when he does it's on a limited timer which punishes you for not slugging. I don't see a valid reason for him to be nerfed out of ptb.
---
I was referring to the fact that it could trigger flashbacks.
---
Adrenaline, Decisive, NOED, and Ruin the 4 perks that need to have an entire game re balancing to render them not being required for every build in the game. No one likes going against them, and they are the focal point of most toxicity. Change my mind
---
Not really. The thing that makes a God loop a God loop is that once the pallet is dropped you can't catch the Survivor without first breaking the pallet, otherwise they can loop you around the pallet forever.
---
THE FUCKING DC'S ARE OUT OF CONTROL.  WE NEED THE PUNISHMENT SYSTEM IN ASAP.
---
sure...
---
Darn. My huge coat is better anyway
---
Wait a second. How does the survivor scream if they have their tongue ripped out?
---
I believe I read somewhere in their lore that they were, but I may be wrong on that front.
---
I BET YOU DC AGAINST AN IRI HEAD HUNTRESS. BECAUSE IT "ISN'T FUN"
---
To be honest the way the entity looked was pretty cool
---
I beg to differ. The sweater shows that the sun has risen. Also, helicopters were one of the main means of transporting American soldiers to Vietnam.
---
"oops, everyone could see how bad matchmaking was and avoid it ahead of time"
---
Because for any good it does, it also allows people to tunnel low rank players or avoid the red rank player, etc.
---
Trapper is basically Jason.
---
Mask? Check.
---
Machete? Check.
---
And he has bear traps like Jason has in the Friday the 13th game.
---
THIS HAPPENED TO ME TODAY. I HAD A SURVIVOR TRAPPED IN A ROOM ON HADDONFIELD AND COULDN'T ATTACK. FIGURED MY CONTROLLER WAS BUSTED.
---
Yeah but Oni's one shot ability is way better than Billy's chainsaw which gets stuck on walls and has very limited turning ability
---
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is a wonderful show
---
NOED I is better than NOED III change my mind
---
It works with DS
---
I was an OG Legion main, I'm used to it.
---
Feel like... ya didnt read the post... and you're probs in a group that would do stuff like this lmao
---
When the lawsuits over im 95% sure we will get jason
---
If DS is useless, why is it the most used perk in high ranks? If it's so easily countered by smart killer plays, why does every high rank survivor use it?
---
Theoretically, Borrowed Time is useless because the killer can just wait out the timer. In practice, it's one of the best perks in the game.
---
You also can't know someone is running it unless you don't have Obsession perks and there is an obessession. Even then, the obsession isn't guaranteed to be the ds user, so you have to pretend that all 4 survivors have it.
---
HAWKINS IS BETTER THAN GAME I THINK.
---
That‚Äôs a twist.
---
They were deep in enemy territory. Kars and Wamuu were very nearby, but the two simply couldn't help themselves. Jojo called out Caesar's username. Lisa Lisa's tears flowed freely. But their heartbroken cries of grief were answered only by a cold silence. Caesar...was gone. As they mourned him, they took solace in one simple fact: Though his body had died, his upvote would live on through their meme. Rest in peace... Caesar Zeppeli
---
Never said that. It just baffles me that I said one sentence you lost your chops. Balanced landing is not toxic but it sure as hell was unbalanced and this change needed to happen
---
I need that Dwight cosmetic
---
People who think trapper can replace Jason ü§°
---
And it doesn't take survivors a minute to pop a generator or two. That also applies specifically to someone wounded and under the effects of deep wounds. You can still loops Legion for a time without getting hit by FF and you make Legion miss his FF. This is far more situational and less busted than I remember him/her being before the major nerfs. Sure it won't be the most enjoyable to play against, and it'll suck to go down, but this is honestly a good thing. Plenty of maps already offer a relatively high chance for insane loops, and this helps alleviate that for a killer. I'd say that BHVR should fix map design to get rid of infinites or near infinites, but I doubt they'll fix map designs anytime soon.
---
Yeah, hes actually like jason except the part were he isnt anything like jason. Most killers wear masks and they're completely different. Again, alot of killers wield a machete. The trapper looks nothing like jason and they're backstories couldn't be more different.
---
Ok while you guys are arguing about who's sacraficing whom I'm just going to down you both with my leatherface chainsaw.

Me, the moment I let go of the generator

Just saw this video in my recommended. I was hoping someone would use it as a meme template, gj.
---
They're going to hotfix deep wounds to be based on proximity instead of TR. Once again Legion's busted nonsense drops the health of the game by another tier.
---
I haven‚Äôt checked it out in a while, but last I heard it was going nowhere fast. I still have a little hope though.

If he's fast vaulting that means that his power is active and he can't down you even if he wanted to. Just walk away
---
I have hope even if its the slightest bit. Its a shame the f13 game died because of it
---
Every survivor uses dead hard, and dead hard is legit the most balanced perk in the game. Your logic is flawed. Every killer uses BBQ because bonus bloodpoints are nice and this game is grindy as fuck.
---
Enjoy your penalty.
---
What icon pack is that?
---
Dead hard is garbage.
---
They don't use it for the points they use it for the aura reading. You're just an idiot
---
Same dude, same
---
He doesn't have to work long enough to get what he gets. He's pretty much a better Billy. Calling it now he's getting nerfed for sure.
---
Thank you
---
Clearly you don't understand it's the peak of quality
---
YES, HAHA. There was a time I was grinding out as every character to get their adept. When I got to Laurie, I really didn‚Äôt want to run OoO because I knew the killer would think I‚Äôm cocky. Well, that is what exactly happened and I got tunneled all game, rip.

If a survivor opens the locker your other self is hiding in, they are grabbed and you switch to them instantly.

I JUST WANTED TO GET BP FOR THE NEW TEACHABLES ON THE PTB, BUT KEEP SLIP AND SLIDING ACROSS THE MAP UNTIL I DISCONNECT
---
what about the Demogorgon then? I'd say it's probably comparable in terms of lethality with a xenomorph. (as comparable as two fictional entities in disparate universes that is, I think these sort of power level arguments are an exercise in futility; even if they are fun.)
---
Players: Rework Haddonfield
---
BHVR: It is done
---
I'll wait until I see the update performance before I make any further judgement. I main spirit but dont often play killer. I mostly play survivor and there isnt much you can do against a good spirit rn.
---
I didn't say anything resembling that, actually. My first point was actually that all Killers should be powerful enough at base that no perks are ever mandatory for them to be competitive. I can't have a discussion with someone who isn't willing to read what I say.

Then he cancels the power and keeps chasing you

Nice hussle, tons of fun

You get a huge lead when they cancel their power. Just run to the next loop, like any other killer
---
She's got claws, those are trendy. Also she won't need a weapon for DS since she already has ten of them
---
One too many ghostfaces breaks a man
---
Well, it looks like their reasoning was "Nemesis will be strong on Legion," and apparently they didn't think ANYTHING beyond that. Not why it would be strong, not if there's any better way to keep it from being OP (which it still is in a 1v1 context), just "nerf = fix, buffing something else = nerf will be fine."
---
I guess that happens when devs don't play their own game.
---
In my opinion Oni is better; this is why I think so: his dash is a little slower but you can full on flick and turn corners so easily that it‚Äôs really hard to outplay. Pretty much before Billy got that turning limitation. So with the power to flick and curve around corners with a one-shot and no real drawback I think he is better.
---
Someone please mod it so that it makes the bonk sound on being hit.
---
I like playing survivor and it would be a nice surprise to forget i have that installed.
---
Asian women usually like it rough. I speak from experience
---
That definitely does ruin the whole teamwork aspect of this game especially if they go.out of their way to get you killed.

Not thin skin just observation from this person is what I see.

Disconnecting is for pussies. If I get outplayed all game I just open the gate and stand in the corner like the garbage I am

Not just you. I've been noticing more and more survivors acting toxic in recent months, both as a survivor and as a killer.
---
Fuck it, elf dwight
---
Nothing is worse than monstrous shrine, my dude
---
Maybe they were just goofing off, I don‚Äôt take every game I play seriously. I know a lot of people do, but once you‚Äôve played this disaster for awhile the worry of 4k‚Äôs escaping and rank kinda goes out the window
---
It‚Äôs a generic bonk sound used in many cartoons. Usually for getting hit in the head with either a club or coconut.

Now I want the easter bunny and tooth fairy
---
God I wish. Been trying to level several killers to get their shareables and it's been a huge pain having a killer that I'm levelling and *want* to play, but since I haven't gotten BBQ on them I lose out on so many bloodpoints, so I end up playing Nurse or Billy instead since I have it on them.

YEAH THE RIFT ISNT EXACTLY CONGRUENT WITH CASUAL GAMEPLAY.
---
^^^ I'd just like to point on this isn't the first time I've seen this ass hole commenting on people's fan art trashing it  
---
Being an ass hole isn't funny. You're an attention seeker. Fuck off.
---
If they are affected by the third seal, yes they wont see a trapped survivor. No it wont affect small game what so ever, atleast not to my knowledge
---
You. Keep talking.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs a glitch. Had it happen a couple of times now. Survivor gets hooked half-way and then player gets kicked from the game, but their character is stil ‚Äúactive‚Äù. Everybody that dies can spectate the killer, and the killer can‚Äôt leave until a gate has been opened or the hatch has been closed, because your character is still in the game.
---
Hopefully DBD does something about this soon. It‚Äôs very annoying.
---
Thanks my main man
---
I just dig the memes. I've become a lot saltier in my old age so I don't help the toxicity, but I'd like to see it reduced too.
---
Cool but that doesn‚Äôt answer what the heck and why the heck.
---
I don‚Äôt mind ghostface, I see a lot of survivors that do. But boy do I get irritated when I should‚Äôve exposed his ass and it doesn‚Äôt proc
---
Mate, that's sick as fuck! Well played
---
no problem!
---
I really don‚Äôt like how you can immediately see blood orbs, it makes perks like lightweight, iron will, and poised useless against the oni.
---
Calm down Ochido. üò±
---
Sprint burst, unbreakable, decisive strike, mettle of man
---
If that was the case, they could have just honestly removed the sprint burst part of BL and make it like it was before. Most survivors I went against only ran it for stagger reduction anyways.
---
And this is coming from a guy who hates exhaustion perks with a burning passion.
---
I was almost going to give one to you but nah go fuck yourself.
---
What? Nobody is calling for a Clown nerf. He‚Äôs easily one of the weakest killers in the game. They‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs unfun to play because he erases all opportunities for mind games and encourages a mindless gamestyle
---
because it isn‚Äôt fair if im rank one with a swf that has a lower rank and the killer gets to be bullied by rank ones, i know it might happen anyway if i leave but im not the one bullying and there‚Äôs a chance another low rank might join them
---
The mods there are terrible. Good luck.
---
There's actually a reason why Coldwind is one of the most common maps. Here's a video of the devs explaining why: https://youtu.be/oGJr5N2lgsQ
---
If anything that Jake is the asshole, he was 100% in the wrong. You both could have lived if you both did gens while the other looped.
---
Nurse: imagine not looking at your feet
---
Ghostface
---
Because you obviously tunneled and face camped them. Oh and you didnt let them get to a loop, unfair killer
---
Thicc doesn't always mean "fat". Oni is maximum chonk.
---
BL isnt unbalanced, maps are unbalanced.
---
We need more tbh. Waited 3 years for ONE sweater.
---
For real, I wish he was tall like he is in game. Why can't we have this, bhvr?
---
That's because Bubba keeps eating all of the Clown's finger trophies, and that's just a dick move.
---
For Bill, it would definitely be the [saferoom music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBbwiUVfPtk) from Left 4 Dead. It has a feeling of "you're not safe forever" which also fits the theme of Dead by Daylight.
---
I like the banjos that L4D2's version has more, but since Bill is originally from L4D1, it would have to be the original.
---
Did you even read the comment you replied to?
---
He‚Äôs not Chonk, he‚Äôs shredded
---
And the meme says ‚Äúfinally‚Äù as if the two are similar and other muscular characters aren‚Äôt in the game
---
"limited counterplay" ü§™
---
  Drop the pallet early, do it. Use windows more and conserve pallets.
---
I get why they won‚Äôt do it but it would be sick, would 100% make his the best mori
---
Restart the console and it should be fine afterwards.
---
*Laughs in Nemesis*
---
She is still awesome so people will complaint again :(
---
Watch this link https://youtu.be/HAsusvsYigg
---
If you're good enough: Object of Obsession
---
Nemesis gets rid of the terror radius for survivors so if they have deep wound on them. The deep wound meter will keep going down which makes it impossible for the survivor to stay alive if the legion chases you long enough.
---
They are buffing protection hits tho
---
No problem
---
I think Deliverance DS combo is pretty toxic especially in endgame
---
If this is your counter argument I'd argue laziness then. Otherwise I'd argue corporate greed.
---
Work does cost money but we don't see very much money going into the game. As much as I like the game I'm not going to pretend it's anywhere near perfect. As far as we can tell bug fixes, QoL, and lobby fixing take a back seat to cosmetics (which are also bugged from clipping to falling off player models). 
---
Allocating resources to give the game a face-lift is hardly inefficient. We eat with our eyes and games are no different. Long term players can easily tell you that these small thing like these mori's are dated. I don't understand the mentality of selling the community short of the best possible game at the defense of the developers. 
---
I guess if you're arguing that it's fine developers reuse animations then charge you for it is fine we're never going to see eye to eye on this situation.
---
 Ranks don‚Äôt mean anything I‚Äôm 16 because lately I can‚Äôt play to much and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm better than a lot of ranks 1
---
It's not good on PC either my dude, there's teabaggers in 9 out of 10 games, but it doesn't bother me they can do whatever they want as long as all of us have fun
---
What if they run that one huntress perk (forgot its name because it's hot garbage, glad to see it getting a buff tho I guess?)

even as a surv main, I'm disgusted and feeling bad for this Ghosty
---
... Did you assume for any amount of time that you were the only player in console?
---
the thing is any killer can tunnel if they want to, the only difference is if legion runs one of those perks there's suddenly a time limit on how long you can loop him for, but generally you'll go down either way
---
Yeah survivors like to say the killer was bad when only a single one of them escaped through the hatch, but at least we got 3 so it doesn't matter
---
Again with the prioritizing cosmetics over bug fixing. Fuck man those artists need to get off their asses and fix some bugs.

So that's why he rips out the tongue

Ezio Auditore???

LEGION MAINS RISE
---
Yeah. We played a round last night.
---
Well when they chase down the OoO and find that instead of a tbagging dickhead there's a clueless Laurie who sucks at looping...
---
How do you make the killer look at the screen?
---
You easily would have made it in time if you didn't take that corner so wide lmao
---
I really like running Wakizashi Saya and Bloody Hair Brooch. Wakizashi makes your lunge range and speed coming out of phase INSANE and Hair Brooch lets you get into a phase faster, which for my playstyle of running after people in phase works very nicely
---
WAITING PATIENTLY TO GET THE HALLOWED BLIGHT EVENT ON SWITCH, ONLY FOR BHVR TO GIVE US THE RIFT WITH THE SERUM AS A FREEBIE REWARD FOR TIERS THAT WE CANT EVEN USE BECAUSE IT ALREADY EXPIRED FROM AN EVENT WE DIDN'T GET!  
---
TLDR: NO HALLOWED BLIGHT ON SWITCH, GETS CURRENCY ANYWAY THAT EXPIRES
---
Why is this perk so good on legion? I see this kind of post all the time and I can‚Äôt figure it out
---
How about having the survivors look for parts throughout the map to fix the generators with? Might be able to do something along the sorts of puzzles or challenges to get parts or something.
---
Anyone know the release date?
---
Billy and Nurse are fun to play against, playing vs Legion is unintuitive and repetitive
---
For clarification, he‚Äôs only out on PTB, which is only on PC. Console comes next month
---
[It started with only one survivor being stuck and later the rest](https://clips.twitch.tv/CredulousStrangeEggplantPrimeMe).

By hitting them.

IDC WHAT ANYONE SAYS, KILLERS ARE OVERPOWERED AND SURVIVORS KEEP GETTING FUCKED OVER! AND SINCE THEY CONTROL THE GAME A LOT OF THE TIME THIS GAME IS MORE RAGE INDUCING THAN FUN! I LOVE THIS GAME AND I EVEN SPEND MONEY ON THE DLC AND I NEVER BUY DLC! I PLAY EVERY DAY! EVEN WHEN IT MAKES ME MAD I STAY ON AND DONT DC BUT GOSH DO I HATE IT AT THE SAME TIME. AND IM IN NO WAY SAYING THAT BEING KILLER IS EASY, I DONT PLAY KILLER MUCH BECAUSE IT IS VERY HARD (AND THE LOBBY TIME IS INSANE)! BUT THERE ARE WAY MORE GAMES WHERE THE KILLER WINS AND NOT TO MENTION WHEN PLAYERS ARE SORE WINNERS! I HAVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS THIS WEEK! (ALSO I AM ON THE SWITCH OKAY PLS PC PEOPLE DONT REMIND ME HOW MUCH FUNNER IT IS ON PC WE GET IT).
---
Hes not as strong as I thought he would be, he doesn't have an "extended lunge" in demon mode, it's not a lunge at all, it's a slower attack that doesnt give you a speed boost, harder to hit than normal m1s. I was expecting something akin to tier 3 myers
---
The Devs have made it pretty damn obvious that they wanna get the whole Horror Movie Infinity Gauntlet thing going on with DbD. They've even gone as far as to recently say they've considered Candyman, Chucky and Pinhead with Jason and Pennywise having standing invitations. I guarantee that when this lawsuit bs is over we'll be getting Jason. Even if it's just another Leatherface situation.
---
IMO the problem isn't Legion it's the slowdown meta in general. 
---
They need to rework gens or make a cap on how much stuff you can stack.
---
I‚Äôm just grinding out Steve anyway so that‚Äôs fine

Good

But Ash says the funny grass shit line. So I win.
---
I just want a new Friday the 13th game with Proper NES Jason, Dream Jason from Part V, Uber Jason, FvJ Jason, Remake Jason and Ghost Jason,,, also more counselors from the movies.
---
It does, because it means you‚Äôre way more rusty than a  current rank 1 survivor and you don‚Äôt face red rank killers as often.
---
reddit in a nutshell -\_- makes it hard browsing this site sometimes
---
No, only the person that stuns him is oblivious.
---
Thanks :)
---
DEAD B
---
so that f13 the game fans realize how much better dbd is (not that they dont already kno). as long as we dont get vanessa as a survivor, with a perk for higher running speed and no exhaustion
---
Genji Shimada as a new survivor. Bring back the scrapped climbing mechanics as a perk
---
Yes, because any character with any neckwear has it too
---
He was bm
---
Yeah true, but if they created a huge map and limited the killer combo's to no copy. Maybe add some bans or something. Just spit ballin. If they could pull it off could be really interesting
---
So your options are go down in 20 seconds after a stun or go down in 20 seconds by not stunning? That‚Äôs not counterplay, that‚Äôs just stupid. If you don‚Äôt pallet stun him ever, you lose. If you pallet stun him ever, you lose.
---
This is a joke  of rank 10 that I cant understand? Ruin or noed op lol it have to be a joke
---
Its cringy how fucking obvious it is that 99% of the "experts" telling you how old Legion is back but more op never set a foot on the PTB and just parrot their favourite youtuber. And farm tons of upvotes from equally educated brainlets.

..uhm what experience exactly?
---
Does the Legion cosmetics come with knives and mask too. like with Frank and Susie?
---
It's steam. Steam is down, and that's the problem
---
It's a party in the pallet.
---
Probably not going to be free by the definition, but you will be able to purchase the dlc without the need of irl money. 
---
Unlicensed character=pay with shards or actual money
---
Licensed character= pay with money
---
You should though. I always get mine, unless it's the "a player disconnected while loading" DC.
---
That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre removing it. They don‚Äôt want people dodging lobbies and stretching out queue times. They probably put it in as a nice QOL change and then noticed that lobby dodging skyrocketed and decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it
---
Simmer dow
---
Didnt say OP, said Annoying. And they are annoying hence why I try not run them. Read fully next time :)
---
Scout mains be like this is to hoovys
---
It matches by highest in squad. So if rank 1‚Äôs are going against brown rank killers it‚Äôs due to a lack of killers of their rank, not who they‚Äôre queueing up with.
---
Plus together a generator only takes 44.4 seconds (with two survivors), even with Ruin the math for generators (w/ average skillchecks) definitely favors coordinated survivors, and not to make this into a gen-rushing based post, but you could totally have done that generator together even 1v2 since it generally takes awhile to even patrol the last 3 if they're separated and one can lead the killer off (unless she's very good with her trap placements to catch them early) due to Hag's slower movement speed.
---
The funny thing is, the patch that goes live is supposed to have DC penalty.
---
It might get a workout.
---
like from a COD game?
---
Repost
---
Yep, Steam is dead.
---
I hate this sub man, why downvote this? It‚Äôs the literal truth and wasn‚Äôt casting moral shade on them. I could understand if you went on a rant afterward but literally all you said is that this is exactly why the devs are removing it.
---
From DbD from a few months ago
---
Rather play vs old legion than a doctor if I'm honest
---
Go to Paulie Esther's cosmetic video.
---
Please no
---
if only i had gold to give you
---
No. We don't need him. Anyone who says we do is wrong. Go play Friday the 13th. Actually, don't. It's trash.
---
We‚Äôre not judging you for doing it, it‚Äôs a natural thing. It‚Äôs just that devs don‚Äôt want this to stretch out the queue times. So you‚Äôre still gonna be matched with these people, but won‚Äôt know it until you‚Äôre in game so that you don‚Äôt dodge as many lobbies.
---
Nemesis is a new perk from The Oni that, if a Survivor stuns you, reveals their aura for 4 seconds and gives the Survivor Oblivious for 60 seconds.
---
Oblivious is a relatively new status effect that causes the Survivor to not hear the heartbeat or see the red stain.
---
So basically, Legion hits you with Deep Wounds, and if you stun him with a pallet you're now on the Deep Wounds timer even if he's right on top of you. It's basically Moonwalk Legion without even having to moonwalk.
---
Even the height is correct
---
YOU HAVE MANY VALID POINTS AND I AGREE WITH YOU. THE GAME IS UNBALANCED AND IDK WHO THE HELL DECIDED THAT SURVIVORS HAVE IT BETTER, FOR THE RECORD I PLAY ON SWITCH IDK HOW DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY IS ON PC OR WHATEVER. AND I HAVE TRIED TO PLAY KILLER AND STILL DO (SO FAR ONLY HUNTRESS IS RANKED UP TO 25), YA IT IS STRESSFUL TO BE KILLER BUT WE CAN ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE THE UPPER HAND MOST OF THE TIME. BUT AGAIN SO MUCH OF THE SURVIVOR GAME DEPENDS ON WHO YOU END UP WITH (A GOOD TEAM OF SURVIVORS IS HARD TO FIND BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE IS INTERESTED IN WORKING TOGETHER OR BEING THE DISTRACTION AND SOME PEOPLE EVEN WORK AGAINST THE TEAM) AND IDK THIS GAME FRUSTRATES ME BUT IT IS ALL PART OF THE FUN.
---
you do not if the killer closes the app. although once the devs finaly give us dedicated servers that should fix it right up
---
Those "artists" can texture, color, animatie and program all the same. The amount of work to make a cosmetic can't be very far off from the work that goes into a new animation. The only difference being you can't sell a mori animation (that doesn't mean they won't try though).
---
If you're going to keep arguing without talking points just to have the last word fine use this to feed your online ego; Your absouletly right behavior is a God tier company and deserves no negative criticism.  I'm wrong and my opinion as a long time player mean nothing. I should keep my mouth shut because I don't bring any valuable input to the game. I should be thankful that behavior ever saw fit to bless me with this opportunity to play such a fantastic game.
---
But it only effects injured survivors... it's not nuts, it would hardly impact the meta if it affected all survivors.
---
PLEASE STOP I WANT TO USE SOMETHING OTHER THAN BBQ AND RUIN
---
 Maybe this was Monto?
---
no you just have to be on it when they pop, i got it first try
---
Let‚Äôs just enjoy BL while we can.
---
The experience of delusion
---
why are people comparing feng &amp; yui so much
---
That's still not only one use though...
---
I personally like Nurse, it could be more brutal tho. But I agree that wraith and Trapper are very lazy.
---
See, I never had an issue with the original Legion other people did; so to me, it‚Äôs fine.
---
HOWEVER, be that as it may, I recognize that others hated it. But right now, they are for some UNFATHOMABLE reason, nerfing the Legion. So either they knew this was coming, or they have zero idea how to balance...
---
It's absolutely terrible right now because of how protection hits can proc, but an update is going to make them more reliable. Even then I would still say it's not worth a perk slot seeing as you need to get 3, and that's only by staying close to another Survivor, which means you're both getting pressured into not doing gens, and then you also need to escape at least one of those chases to heal so you aren't dead before it can proc.
---
lol I wasn't raging that hard, but it does grind my gears ya know.
---
Oni's perk "Nemesis" is also messed up, I hope.
---
You could pull a religion act and say he was real.... lol
---
It's much harder for me to win using gf, than nurse, spirit or freddy... and probably billy 2 if I was good at him.
---
Remember last week when everyone was saying this challenge was "literally impossible without a full SWF team AND communicating with the killer"? I got it on like my third try without doing anything different.
---
Notorious chase you mean?
---
You need to change your view of the world, racist fuck. Quit trying to be funny about extremely serious discussions, you know nothing about. I‚Äôm replying here so you‚Äôre buddies can perhaps view your recent posts and condemn them. 
---
Go out! Run or walk, you can meet people. Get out of your dungeon and talk to people; share your life experiences and listen to theirs. You‚Äôll be a much better person and way more attractive if you can hold a conversation besides your hate-filled posts.
---
Heck yeah brother!
---
I'd imagine it would combo nicely with the new perk "Breakout".
---
In the same update as chapter 14, protection hits are supposedly a little more consistent.
---
this is a very old paulie video lol, he's a really great guy i'm in multiple of his videos
---
It's not? I don't think I'm understanding your question. The perk obviously works on everybody. It's just particularly good on those 2.
---
As a legion main myself, i always thought it was weird they didn‚Äôt incorporate the 4-in-1-killer idea
---
You can just feel his anger intensifying lol
---
No it doesn‚Äôt buy you can think what you want fellow
---
Unfair pallets require you to get the stun to start off with. Secondly killer can abuse situation by tunnelling off hook and forcing DS in which you either intentionally miss and die or hit and then still die because of this oblivious BS. It‚Äôs not always avoidable at all. If you really think this is a fair mechanic then I think you need to rethink how biased your view point is.
---
Is the new chapter free or no
---
I absolutely love Trapper. He's my favourite DBD killer all around and he's the face of the game. 
---
He's no Jason Voorhees, though. If they ever bring Jason in, he's going to have his own set of power and distinct feel to him. He's a legend. Jason, Freddy and Michael are like the unholy trinity.
---
yeah, we need another stupid 3 gen build like the doctors so we can enjoy 60 minutes long games.
---
Yes man rip that perk
---
BHVR Logic:
---
&gt;Nerf legion to the ground
---
Also BHVR:
---
&gt;Add perk that makes him broken even more than on release
---
no
---
Every killer gets nerfed before actual release. The playstyle stays the same though, usually. Learn the playstyle and you should be fine
---
They should give Ace a Nick outfit.
---
No chapter is going to be free?
---
Deep wound is his power, with the perk nemesis that's coming out on the oni if you get stunned or blinded the person who did it becomes the obsession and gets oblivious for awhile. The idea is the survivor stuns you, you use your power and vault the pallet and hit them with deep wound. Because they're oblivious the timer never stops ticking down and eventually you'll go down to it or you'll stop to mend and the legion that's been following you waiting for you to go down will just hit you again and down you. People are forgetting that all you have to do to stop this from happening is not stun the legion after you know what he's doing but apparently that's not fun counterplay since they'll just take beast of prey and get bloodlust and do the same thing. Even though that takes a long time to do too and is ultimately not worth doing
---
They told me son, you‚Äôre special you were born to do great things. But clearly they were wrong *unzips pants*

I was initially really concerned about that as well, but apparently [it‚Äôs incredibly ineffective](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dywl88/prepare_for_the_arrival/f85d1o9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).
---
and whats the counterplay for the last guy? not even a locker can hide u from KI, so if he tabs 3 ppl (it's not that hard) he gets a free down?
---
She looks high as shit, good art
---
Fantasies of Feng Min that's what
---
He has a dope mori, beating Demogorgons
---
Sloppy is no longer being applied by Legions power now. So the only one you'll have to deal with is Thanatophobia.
---
Gen grabber spirit, it‚Äôs hilarious. Play it before they update the game where it‚Äôs much less powerful
---
Instead of gens you have to cook the food and cook it correctly with skill checks, if you fail it notifies Gordon and he started chasing you. If you complete all the cooking stations you can escape Hell‚Äôs Kitchen
---
So dead hard should make you have to see a doctor if you stay hard for too many hours?
---
ME TOO! im trying to stream right now and its not working for me either. Let me know if you find a solution!!!!
---
mr. oni i swear i‚Äôm vibin give me another chance üò≥
---
Yes. I thought of a similar concept more like scorpion from MK, but this is better.
---
yeah just been snatching them from everything I can lmao
---
Sounds cool except the perk is like an even worse Thanatophobia
---
Cause it‚Äôs the only exhaustion perk that had a passive? It needs to fit in with the other ones
---
I don't see how it's better considering the perk only activates on a flashlight blind or stun. The moonwalking was something you could do on every game and there was nothing the survivor could do about it, at least with this perk the survivors can just try to avoid stunning and blinding him
---
I'm sorry, but that doesn't look like a disconnection symbol....
---
oh right bc the removal of BL fixes that map? it wont. not even close. If you honestly think that then please play that map without that perk, you can still run main building.
---
also lockers are fucking everywhere and hardly counts as an exhaust perk. more then anything its just a cooldown perk but with extra steps.
---
Cool convoluted hijack bro.
---
Go do some bones, it‚Äôll replace the bp and help with noed ;)
---
This is probably the best concept for a Legion rework I've seen so far. Even just the changes to Feral Frenzy would be appreciated, Deep Wound is just such a shit and uninteresting effect.
---
He can just tunnel somebody off the hook and force DS. Either you miss and die or you don‚Äôt miss and still die because of the broken mechanic.
---
Wuh??
---
That's because nobody realizes that you'd have to get bloodlust after hitting them first. You have to hit with the FF and then chase them for an extra 15 seconds to get a stack of bloodlust and then wait for the timer to tick down. People kinda overlooked the idea that once you get out of bloodlust by hitting them, you have a terror radius again
---
Them being oblivious doesn't remove your TR they just lose the ability to tell they're in the TR.
---
Beast makes the Killer undetectable however and will work but it takes so long to get Bloodlust active you might as well just M1 them twice instead
---
So are things that aren‚Äôt directly related to the game. Check and Mate. Get this shit outta here (btw I‚Äôm totally joking lol)
---
Heh.  That's hilarious; We Are One is extremely similar to an idea I had for a Legion secondary ability.  I didn't bother posting it as I figured I'd be attacked, but might as well do a brief overview.
---
Three "tokens" for lack of a better word, with which Legion can mark a locker.  Instant action with no visual or audio cue (as not technically an action).  If a survivor comes within X meters of a "marked" locker, a random gang member will exit the locker, ambushing the survivor and inflicting a wound state.  I couldn't think of a practical reason for them to only attack once, but they are a bunch of ADD riddled teenagers, so maybe they got bored. (shrug).  Would give BHVR an excuse to retool some addons as well; instead of deep wound inflicting useless stat afflictions, give that to the gang, with maybe a "inflicts dying", cause why not.  
---
Dunno how difficult implenting one version or another of that would be but obviously I like the idea of getting the rest of the gang involved in an active capacity.
---
It looks like you nerfed Feral frenzy a bit, isn't default recharge time 20 seconds now?  That seems reasonable, I don't really think the power needs any changes, other than I very much dislike the "missed attack ends it entirely" bit, which you kept.  I'd prefer that scratched. (shrug).
---
The hex ability Anarchy seems pretty counter-intuitive with Discordance, and the healing aspect is arguably too strong considering other negative healing perks that would stack with it.  Somewhat self-countered by being a Hex, but still.  
---
Anywho.  My off-the-top reactions.  I know a lot of people still like the Legion concept if not the current implementation and glad to see someone else thinking "inside" the box, pun intended.
---
That was damn impressive.
---
I'd have them all the same build you take in. You'd be able to teleport to anyone you want to with a cool down. Say you are chasing somebody and they are running toward another Legion member. You'd be able to switch to that one. To me it would feel like they are everywhere. Say you have one upstairs in a house. Survivor runs upstairs and you switch to that one. One second you are running from Joe and the next second Julie is running at you from another direction. Take the deep wounds out. I'd have them be crouched when not in use so you can hide them in good places.
---
Eh just switch to dwarvish where every word sounds unpleasant
---
Oni really is cool as fuck
---
True
---
I dated an Asian woman once or twice
---
were you an asshole? yeah, kinda. but that jake was effectively sitting around waiting/expecting you to die instead of participating in the game. they were being a shit and your actions were justified imo.
---
No the experience of having dated a few
---
but he's very fun to play
---
You being Oblivious doesn't mean you're out of the TR, you just can't tell you're in it. I face it in PTB already and they also had Unnerving Presence still affecting me so I was still in the TR
---
Switch players don‚Äôt even have Freddy or Leatherface üòûüòûüòû
---
The issue is, it effectively tells you when the killer is near, which makes oblivious less of a debuff.
---
Too bad he'll never reach the truth.
---
Survivor perks should by design be much weaker than the killers. There are four survivors and one killer. The killers 4 perks are supposed to be equivalent to 16 survivor perks. You can't tell me that DS and adrenaline don't fall into the category of being as strong as the best killer perks. Especially DS since the rework, since it has literally no counterplay.
---
... B O N K ... B O N K, B O N K
---
If you want to play a broken killer for cheap wins juat play Ghost Face.
---
CAN I SEE A FUCKING CLIP OF SOMEONE USING THE DAM PERK ANY MEANS NECESSARY???! SERIOUSLY FOR FUCKS SAKE I JUST WANT TO SEE IF GOING UP!
---
Me, running prove thyself instead
---
Oh fair enough my bad
---
Same thing really it removes it to them but not anyone unaffected by the effect
---
That doesn't look like they escaped
---
OMG!! This chapter is so fun!! Like I honestly feel so bad to whoever hasn‚Äôt tried it yet!! Am I right gu-.... 
---
Oh, sorry hehe. Only 2 weeks &gt;:)
---
Low budget skemooo renders
---
Balanced Landing was the only Exhaustion Perk that could somehow grant the movespeed permanently, so I do believe that the perk was fundamentally broken in a way that because it had a part t hat was always on, some code crossed wires to make it where the sprint burst was the part that remained "passive".
---
This could have been the best way to fix it.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are downvoting this when it‚Äôs absolutely true. Stuns are in the game for a reason.
---
Love the idea! I definitely think all the members of the Legion should be implemented in some way. It would make the Killer so much more unique.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I made some changes :)
---
Your playing him wrong. Hes overperforming and likely to be next for nerf if not a rework altogether.

Turn off console and wait 10 seconds
---
LEGION:
---
DEVS: WE'LL DO IT LIVE! F\*\*K IT!
---
I hope your first born dies of cancer
---
They are good if you use the power to get around the map faster. If I see somebody on the way to a gen I'll hit them but then I chase that person down. I don't bounce around stabbing everybody.
---
Toxic for your team or toxic for the killer
---
Dead Hard is basically a no hit pass for a second. Nevertheless you have to be injured to use it.
---
Because in the backstory shes a girl
---
I'm sick of them nerfing random perks for no reason. Yeah, some tilesets were extremely strong with the stagger reduction but they needed change not the perk. I'm so sick of waiting for mediocre updates by an incompetent development team that seems to be making changes while wearing a blindfold. I'm just done with dealing with this shit, the broken hitboxes, the stagnant gameplay that hasn't changes since launch, and the bullshit nerfs. I'm done.
---
All of them glow, but it's very hard to see unless you're very close up
---
First off you gotta turn that killer sensitivity all the way up, you wanna be able to spin your camera as fast as possible. Your biggest enemies on console are the caps to sensitivity and frame rate. Your FR is capped at 30 (I think) meaning you can see survs as easily as on pc so you‚Äôll never find it quite as smooth and easy. 
---
Honestly my biggest tip with nurse is to play a lot of survivor and other killers first. Nurse whether it be on console or PC is about correctly predictions survivor movements which is only really possible after playing for a while so you can get into the minds of the survivors you‚Äôre up against. 
---
You‚Äôre also going to have to give yourself a grace period where you learn to understand the charging of your blinks, good nurse players have the correct charge time as muscle memory, that‚Äôll come to you in time but you‚Äôll have to be patient and put up with idiotic teabagging at the gates until then. 
---
Hope this helps a little bit.
---
We use it 80% for the points dude. There‚Äôs way better aura reading perks. Stop being a dick to people.
---
I think he‚Äôs referring to shards
---
I like the idea of a heavier punishment for his instadown, blood orbs disappearing faster would also help so someone still injured isn't just leaving a constant refill
---
The entity would lower the hooks for him , not that unimaginable
---
Are all killers just supposed to be defeated by a plank of wood? Not a single one of them should have something that works better around a pallet than all of the other killers?
---
I agree. I take back what I said about the add ons. She has one for base movement speed increase. It helps a little. I used to be horrible with her. I'm able to get atleast 2 or 3ks now and I get hooks all match. The thing that helped me most was working on short blinks first. Long blinks are way harder especially if they break line of sight. When you get close dont try to chase them just try to blink to them and get a hit. If you keep coming up too short then hold it a second or so longer everytime. The more you do it the more comfortable you will get.
---
No do explain. It makes me sound what? I fail to see the issue here
---
Mebbe

---
It ranking based on highest rank is new, that was added like a month ago. And no, adding a competitive ranking system to this casual game would be a terrible idea. The ranks are there to try to separate by experience and that‚Äôs about it, it‚Äôs not competitive by nature
---
He doesnt look super bad but he has a speedy move that's worrisome. Like billy without the bumping into walls problem
---
Oh that makes more sense. Just found out recently that other ppl can buy The Spirit and David with shards. For some reason I‚Äôm not able to.
---
As a console player it‚Äôs actually the opposite
---
Yeah but is 3 for one a good deal?
---
Thank you so much for the advice!
---
WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY NERF LEGION? HIS POWER IS BASICALLY USELESS AS IS! TALK ABOUT KICKING SOMEONE WHILE HE IS DOWN. I GUESS BUBBA IS NEXT. LET ME SUGGEST THAT WHEN HE REVS UP HIS CHAINSAW YOU HAVE TO MAKE THREE DIFFICULT SKILL CHECKS OR ELSE HE FALLS DOWN AND HAS TO WAIT FOR A SURVIVOR TO PICK HIM UP
---
Kinda obnoxious bro...
---
I don't think so unless he was using an alias.
---
Spirit has tits too
---
Her axe, yes. Her throwing hatchets no.
---
&gt;He doesnt look super bad but he has a speedy move that's worrisome. Like billy without the bumping into walls problem
---
I don't know if he is good or bad, just saying that this amount of spam leads me to believe he is a bit on the OP side.
---
Bull you use it because aura it shows you where survivors are. If it was just for points no one would have an issue with the aura read being nerfed or removed. Tell the people being dicks to me to stop first jackass then talk to me
---
PUPPERS DID A SURVIVOR GAMEPLAY VIDEO TODAY WHERE HE PLAYED THE NEW SURVIVOR WITH THAT PERK. CHECK HIM OUT ON THE YOUTUBES.
---
Ahh thank you for the advice. I‚Äôll definitely keep trying, I might try to get a few customs going with some friends to get to grips, what put me off was playing at red ranks as a killer I‚Äôm terrible with, really threw me off the game hah
---
It stops the deep wound timer from staying and will continue to tick down. The devs worded the perk wrong though because the only thing that makes the survivor oblivious is when they stun or blind the killer, but the perk makes it sound like its everytime the obsession changes
---
LMAO!! The truth behind this is real. When I want to die I kobe and when I need the luck to kobe off the game fucks me lol
---
WHY IS SWF MATCHMAKING STILL FUCKED ON THE XBOX? I EXPERIENCE ABOUT A 30% FAILURE TO INVITES AND ENTERING A MATCH WITH MY TEAM. STOP FUCKING WITH SHIT THAT ISN'T BROKEN AND FIX THIS DAMN GAME

It‚Äôs also the only exhaustion perk that isn‚Äôt useable on some maps and it‚Äôs the hardest exhaustion perk to initiate as it‚Äôs usually a lot harder to find a ledge than a window or to just start running/press the trigger button. The passive made up for that, it‚Äôs gone from being one of the best exhaustion perks to not worth running.
---
It's rather we've had every killer on ptb release since Spirit get nerfed before live release (besides demo) that we dont want it to happen to another killer, if you looked at my argument you'd seen that I said  "***First.*** *Make failed hits in Demon Mode be more publishable, if Demo is gonna get punished for 2 seconds for a lunge that does one health state Oni should be given the same treatment. It's only fair he at least gets 2.5 seconds of stunned duration for failing a hit that can instadown, especially while charging"* Which is a nerf to his power. That's only one example out of the three though, I do believe Oni needs tweeking and some nerfs but what I'm saying is nothing drastic cause usually when BHVR nerfs something they nerf it to much like BL.
---
I don't see how. I made a joke all be it a joke based on experiences I've had
---
I'm against hard counters with little interactivity on the perk side of things but No mither should definitely lower the orb drop rate by a noticeable margin at least
---
How would the narrator know?
---
Yeah lol. Probably not a good place to be trying to practice with her. Those guys probably only faced her for a long time.
---
no, they act just like the sweaters for survivors do, as standalone items
---
So do men.
---
Every map has a drop name one that doesn‚Äôt
---
How do you not know?
---
Ngl the oni is daddyish
---
Nea already has a sweater?
---
it's kinda weird reading the replies here. A lot of people defending survivors because they're using "just meta perks" and "it's all in the game to use"... I agree, I really do. 
---
But so is insidious and standing in a corner.
---
Because I'm not a pedophile.
---
I don't think so unless he was using an alias or was the killer. I recorded this last night. You got a link to the youtube clip? I'm curious to see how it happened to him. I just walked up on my teammates and they were already stuck.
---
you didn‚Äôt understand what i typed. i‚Äôm not saying make this a competitive game, there‚Äôs literally no way you can make it competitive with how it is, anyway, i‚Äôm saying make it to where rainbow six siege has it to where you can only que with a certain amount of people who are within a certain range of your rank. it‚Äôs not that hard to do and it would make the game more balanced, especially for newer players.
---
I completed that challenge on the first try by doing this. 
---
I burned an offering to start with all survivors
---
Next I brought the following perks: Bond, Dark Sense, Prove thyself, and good old self care. I also brought a toolbox with a brand new part. 
---
Anyways we rushed through the first gen. Then I jumped on a gen by myself and used my brand new part. The third gen I found with bond. I ended up completing 4 gens that game with this setup.
---
Someone gets wrecked by pallets a little too often.
---
Are survivors supposed to have no way to defend themselves? Should none of them even have the option to use the pallets for stuns?
---
So what you are saying is that the map is hardly effected and the nerf was not the answer.
---
I don‚Äôt. I see a lot of DCs imo
---
ggez
---
Reality is often... disappointing
---
Trapper. TRAPPER MAINS UNITE!
---
yea you do have to be injured to use it, its almost like you spend most of the game injured since anti healing perks are meta
---
* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, ‚Ä¶).
---
How about we just keep it as is.
---
More nerfs to Solo Survivor players unfortunately. Not really sure how BHVR expect to fix what some vocal killer mains say is the biggest problem (SWF) if all they do is punish solo players. The last month or so if I joined a lobby with Rank 15s as a Rank 9 at least I had an option of adjusting my expectations or noping the fuck out.
---
That isn‚Äôt even an argument
---
Because some people won‚Äôt be happy until killers are guaranteed 4 kills every single game.
---
Best case scenario running this perk on legion goes like this: You find a survivor at a pallet, they stun you (you'll probably run enduring since you **have** to be stunned or blinded for it to work), you use your power and vault the pallet, you hit them and then follow them for the next 10 seconds (assuming you double hit them with franks mix tape on), they go down and you go pick them up and hook them. Even in the best case scenario it's still about 20-30 seconds spent downing and hooking that one survivor
---
most likely what would happen is the survivor would run you around the loop a couple times until you get close enough, (if they're decent at the game) they'll throw the pallet down early so you don't get stunned and then you chase them down like a regular legion player but you have two perks that might get used a few times in that match and your addons aren't useful at all because you didn't use your power since you were hoping that they would stun you
---
Says them takes a breath reads the matchup data to see what they played vs what I played. Types GG.
---
Play in your muddy puddles with your toys, Peppa.
---
Who does she voice?
---
Black Lightning. Really good show.
---
3 Survivors seems a bit excessive. They'd have to come up with 9 unique perks. And I guess you could argue that Stranger Things got 2 Survivors but it pretty goddamn popular. Scream Queens isn't really close to ST's level so 1 Survivor is what they'd probably go with.
---
That‚Äôs still a terrible idea. Not only does it lock people out from playing with their friends just because one of them was busy for a month or two but it would also wreck queue times. If a low rank player is matched up with a high rank group when solo queuing it‚Äôs because it was the only available group with somewhat mediocre ping for them to join. It doesn‚Äôt just assign randomly. So your solution just ruins Swf in a casual game and make queue times even worse for everyone.
---
I can‚Äôt stand self-caring so I‚Äôve been stuck on the self-care challenge for.. just, far too long. When other survs are always willing to heal you, how are you supposed to say no!? &gt;&lt;
---
It has so many little details for Bill. Plus it's green. His favorite color. Military color. Honestly this sweater has so much character in it. I can see myself buying it
---
They need to bring back where a pallet stun during any part of the animation allows for a save.
---
Well it helps not give Hag an instant free hit if the player is smart enough to trigger them from a distance.
---
Sweetheart, we‚Äôre talking about using Beast Of Prey‚Äôs Undetectable effect ‚ÄúAfter‚Äù they‚Äôre affected by Deep Wounds. 
---
Use frenzy to get first hit. 
---
Run after them to close gap. 
---
Cancel Power and walk at them. 
---
Don‚Äôt kick a pallet and keep line of sight for BL 1 to trigger. The survivor now has at most 30 seconds until they go down. This is shortened with Frank‚Äôs Mix Tape, Stab Wounds Study, or evening just running Nemesis.
---
Skinny men also have tits. How would the wiki know?
---
My point, which is quite clearly already stated but I‚Äôll tell you again since I have the time, was that: Everyoen other killer can have this countered by DS at least giving you a small chance at maybe postponing the chase long enough for you to *maybe* get out but of The legion can essentially turn your own perk against you don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs a little broken? Not mention entirely removing stubs from a match is a little stupid considering there‚Äôs a reason the devs put stuns into the game. You can‚Äôt just go ‚Äòhur dur silly survivors just give up the entire stun game mechanic so I can‚Äôt proceed to cheesily take you out with my shitty ass inevitable timer‚Äô. Look man I‚Äôm up for legion buffs as much as the next guy but this is not the way to do it.
---
It‚Äôs just Steam, it does that everytime you download something.
---
Having a killer like Legion who can already vault pallets and can now kill anyone uses the pallet isn‚Äôt a having a killer who ‚Äúdoes better around pallets‚Äù it‚Äôs breaking one of the only tools a survivor has at their disposal. But keep making excuses so you can win a few matches or whatever
---
Make the last frame a real mask
---
Does she need an add on for it?
---
It's pretty great how all the liscensed characters are getting Cosmetics now, fingers crossed for bubba and Freddy (Quintin's bitchass too)
---
But at that point why not just take a different perk that would shut down a loop like bamboozle? At least that way you aren't spending like 30 seconds for your perk to work
---
Ghsotface isn‚Äôt anywhere near on the same level as those other 3. Hag, Huntress, and Myers outpace him by a ton. He has very poor map pressure and nothing to counter looping. While the stealth is ok, and the occasional insta down is useful, it‚Äôs not enough to do well against competent survivors.

Could make it where getting a hit restores 50% of his power instead of all of it, or make it diminishing returns (100%, 75%, 50%) so that you can spread out to counter him, and the last guy can make a last ditch effort to book it away from the group to survive.
---
Also, you could try to bodyblock your team so you aren't the last one hit. Legion is the Anti-Dwight in that he and his teachables don't want the survivors working together.
---
You're absolutely misinformed if you think any of them are even closer to Myers. They ate by far the worst killers in the game. Myers is high mid teir. Nowhere close. This isnt my opinion. This is a common known fact amongst the entire community and all top players.
---
pper
---
the oni is like a great great great ancestor to rin, since he comes from samurai times (prob towards the end idk)
---
As per my last email, it was confirmed through in-game Lore.
---
?? I was playing as survivor and whenever I fleshlighted any if her traps they activated and she often teleported to them and then chased me.
---
It‚Äôs actually a good map for leatherface
---
Lmao I just realised autocorrect put oni to onion
---
True lol bubba just makes it worse
---
incest? i've yet to see incest on there, enlighten me
---
I actually loved that show and would totally be ok with this
---
Timer won‚Äôt reset back to 120 but it‚Äôll start counting down from 80. Say you heal up again after 20s then that leaves you with 60s of no-bleed time before it gets disabled. Think of it like this: Being in the healthy state pauses the timer and you get a total of 2mins.
---
it really doesn‚Äôt, especially if they do add in crossplatform play. it doesn‚Äôt ruin casual swf, it ruins bullying lower ranks (high ranks). it doesnt take that long to rank up either so if they were gone for however long it doesnt take that long to rank up by yourself, and i know that as a solo survivor. 
---
it just seems to me that you‚Äôre one of those swf‚Äôs that likes to get a lower rank friend and bully low rank (high rank) killers being they way you‚Äôre seeming to get to agitated by what i‚Äôm saying. or maybe it‚Äôs because of my flair? ü§î. anyway, i‚Äôm done conversing with you.
---
 please just add more faces for Bubba. The rest of the survivors. I would also really like it if he wore their hair as well. It would be so adorable seeing him with Meg's pigtails. Plus it would help differentiate the masks. Seeing him wear Neas beanie etc. Just their default hair and face would be fine. That's all I ask.
---
Also scariest killer in the game. Bubba with Nea mask.
---
I second this
---
Get a 4K as killer chat is dead or get abused and called a camping tunneling cunt even if you get 12 hooks.
---
Get no kills 4 gg‚Äôs and some trash talk about how bad you are.
---
You didn't read the post.
---
Nah for me I enjoy the game whether I win or lose as long as the game felt long and healthy. Everyone died after some spicy chases and a couple of hooks each? Good on you killer you deserve it, good fun! I died because I happened to be found first and now there‚Äôs a ghost face hiding in a bush next to me ready to counter BT with his stealth and put me straight on the hook? That‚Äôs kinda cheese and no I‚Äôm not gonna day gg because it wasn‚Äôt really a good game.
---
I don‚Äôt support pay to win models. I like to prestige my favorite killers so most of the time I play with whatever perks I have unlocked since I never go past level 50 unless the character is p3.
---
the satire news company is the new killer
---
Al most every game, see noed is very rare in red rank in the last 500 games noed works like two times
---
Man I can remember one match againts the pig where I do the five totems and she have noed I was so proud of my self that game because I was the first that she hit after the last gen
---
Ok boomer. Obviously pedophiles never like little boys. /s
---
Its meh on two killers, it should be useful even on killers that dont have everyone injured
---
What idiots.

NEMESIS ON LEGION DOESNT BREAK HIM AND TURN HIM INTO THE OLD LEGION; 
---
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE REALLY HEAVY TO ENSURE THE INSTADOWN; IT WILL STILL TAKE 30 SECONDS FOR THE DEEPWOUND TO KILL YOU AND IN MY EXPERIANCE WITH SHITY P3 CLAUDETTES WHO GOT INTO REDRANKS VIA FUCKING URBAN EVASION WONT LAST THAT LONG IN A CHASE ANYWAY 
---
IT MAKES HIS WORTHLESS ADDONS (FRANKYS AND THE REDUCTION ADDONS FOR THE DW TIMER) ACTUALLY USEFULL AND THE REDUCED MENDTIMER MAKES PLAYING AGAINST THEM LESS OF A M1 SIMULATOR
---
ALSO THERE IS EASY COUNTERPLAY TO THIS CRAP: IF YOU FACE LEGION AND SOMEONE GETS DEEPWOUNDS DO A FUCKING GEN! EVEN IF HE GOES FOR THE EASY DOWN YOU CAN DO ALMOST FUCKING DO HALF A GEN IN THE TIME UNTILL THE MATE GOES DOWN FFS
---
DROP PALLETS EARLY SO LEGION EITHER HAS TO BREAK IT; MAKEING NEMESIS A BIT MORE USELESS OR JUMP OVER IT AND STAB YOU ANYWAY THE WAY THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT AT THIS POINT ON LIVE SERVERS EZPZ
---
PEOPEL COMPLAINING ABOUT IT CUTTING DOWN CHASES ARE TALKING NONESENSE. YOU HAVE AN EASY EQUASION
---
N SEC (BEFORE STUN) + 0.9 SEC + 30 SEC (WITHOUTADDONS) OF CHASE TIME ; 
---
WITH THE BALANCED LADING NERFS EVERYONE IS GOING TO RUN SPRINT BURST TO JUST RUN AWAY BEFORE THEY APROACH YOU; LITHE  TO USE WINDOWS WHICH DONT ACTIVATE NEMESIS OR FUCKING DEAD HARD TO JUST DODGE THE FRENZY ATTACK DEPLETING THE POWER AND MAKEING NEMESIS USELESS AS THE RECHARGETIME FOR FRENZY IS LONG AS FUCK AND IT NEEDS TO BE CHARGED FULLY TO BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE  
---
AS LEGION THE GAME BECOMES A GAME OF DECISIONMAKEING: "DO I USE FRENZY TO EASILY INJURE SURVIVORS AND MAYBE APPLY PIN DEBUFS? OR DO I KEEP IT MAYBE ENSURE A DOWN? OR MAYBE INSURE SOME TO SLOW THEM DOWN VIA DEEPWOUNDS WITH ADDONS"
---
ALSO LEGION WOULD BE A REALLY EASY KILLER TO PLAY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO; THEY CAN EASILY DOWN SURIV WITH THE RIGHT ADDONS BUT IT TAKES A LONG TIME SO AT RED RANKS PEOPLE WILL JUST PUSH THE GENS WHILE SOMEONE SLOWLY BLEEDS TO THEIR DEATH AND AT LOW RANKS: LETS BE HORNST THEY WILL DIE BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT.
---
THANKS FOR COMEING MY TED SCREAM

When this goes live, the DC punishment system will be in place.
---
Maybe the first two days will see a lot of DC, but after that not so much.
---
I think its kinda ok because it takes some time to charge his power, just like The Shape
---
I got the grey jacket with yelliw gloves, but kept default head and jeans. Thinking about copping the Scoops head though!
---
toxic people in general ruin this game
---
You're so arrogant and opinionated that what you fail to see is that I'm arguing for the betterment the game. You take these criticisms as personal attacks and mount a defensive immediately. I'll admit I don't know the specifics of character design but I know enough to know this. You dont go to design school and only learn how to make cosmetics. Nor do you hire a team of designers who only know how to make skins. That's insane.
---
Rank 16? Prepare yourself for this blood bath?
---
I don't remember which Streamer it was, but Bamboozle hurts you more than it helps.
---
You can mind-game a Window and a pallet. You cut off the window and that pallet is getting dropped.
---
All battle passes are not designed to be done by all the people that complete it. Im aware you alluded to this but in reality its the only answer that matters.
---
Battle passes are designed to be completed by the daily grinders the ones who play several hours a day, every day. Its designed this way so that they have something to grind for every day and theyre not stuck completing it a month before the next one.
---
Those who play maybe every day for an hour or two or do several hours at a time a couple times a week but dont play every day they will get probably about half way through maybe a bit more. Or if theyre really efficient they might complete it but they will still get way more than 10 dollars worth of stuff so its still absolutely worth it in terms of dollars and cents.
---
Those who play every so often but really have no hope of finishing they get rewarded by unlocking things through the free pass, still getting bonus blood points through the archives, but in terms of dollars and cents should not by the battle pass. Now if youre happy with your return on investment by all means go ahead.
---
That's just how battle passes work and its really the only way they can work in order to keep everyone happy.
---
As far as the point with comparing to other battle passes I actually think this is a pretty good,  above average battle pass. You get some auric cells back you get some really cool cosmetics on the free side which is usually not the case and you get bonus bloodpoints on top of it. The challenges are a bit ridiculous and I'd rather see more emphasis on earning them naturally instead of playing unorthodox and potentially screwing over your team (killer ones seem pretty good so far from what I've seen) but overall in terms of length and earning its not too bad. I've seen some battlepasses where the math worked out to like 2+ hours a day of playing.
---
The other passes seeming achieveable is more the challenge system but if you actually do the math I bet not many of them actually beat DBD in time played.
---
Lmao
---
So the idea is to chase a survivor like normal, hit them like normal, hit them again like normal, then walk after them for 15 seconds for your perk to activate to then wait 15 seconds for them to go down? Why not just take a different perk that you don't need two addons and 30 seconds to make work?
---
You can mindgame 99% of loops for both sides, just by watching how the player plays. Only rancid abattoir is the last really BS one left against survivors since BL is now nerfed, and the really bad maps have pretty much been changed(Like the school) where they have pallets so crap that by running to it is pretty much a free hit since all the killer needs to do is blood lust 1 to win. 
---
So I mean in the end it sucks for both sides, but the main thing is this. Both sides has counterplay. This revisit for legion has none. The legion wants you out the game for some reason? Well tough luck you lose. Nothing you can do to stop it.
---
Wait why would the perk be so good on him?
---
This happened to Monto
---
I mean, there was a time when swf didnt exist. And they were much simpler times.
---
yeah i was really lost on what i should do on the thumbnail next time i make a thumbnail ill take my time on it
---
I was in a game where I crouched near trap, pointed flashlight at it, and it activated. I was crouched the whole time and did it multiple times.
---
True lol
---
Hillbilly does a cool trick, spinning his hammer, which can definitely flick blood off
---
BABY MEG BEING ON THE VERGE OF UNHOOKING ME, DECIDES TO OPEN THE GATE ON THE OTHER END OF THE MAP. SHE DECIDES TO COME BACK WITHOUT MAKING PROGRESS ON THE GATE LEVER AND UNHOOKS ME IN FRONT OF THE KILLER. AND GUESS WHO THE MIKE MAN DECIDES TO HIT.
---
M/K. I‚Äôve seen people play really well with her on controller when I played on PS4.
---
Also No Counterplay Legion is back.

You can't keep an edgy teen down.

Well now we need Scout as a killer
---
a lot of people will agree that hillbilly, nurse and spirit are the best. in my personal opinion, every killer is about the same if you‚Äôve got good perks and add-ons!
---
My friend and I did this challenge on our first try (we also did all 5 gens with a random nancy)
---
If they're running beast of prey + Nemesis, they don't even need to trigger it, the legion just have to stab them with Feral Frenzy, and then wait for bloodlust 1.
---
What?
---
Yea I've seen some pretty good ones. I rarely see her though.
---
Deep wound rework coming soon after
---
Legion mori himself when you run out of timer
---
You spoiled my gaming plot when i get moried.
---
Urbanface would be cool, but I just want Bubba to have Aceface. 
---
Just imagine Ace's sly grin frozen in death over Bubba's face. It'd be SO unnerving!

Oblivious does not tell you when they are near. You get the status effect from closing Demogorgon portals.
---
Same with Ghostface.
---
Aye
---
From what I saw, depends. While oni can control the one shot ability and not get as stunned as much with demon charge, he needs to slash someone with his katana and collect some blood. So in terms of controlling and aiming, oni is better. In terms of getting from one spot to the next, billy.
---
This map desperately needs a rework.
---
I already got almost 1M so I spent them on Rin but I'm definitely gonna grind next week or it's just loosing BP as they're sadly not stacking

Do you get unlimited attacks in fury mode?

Oh my god is that dead rising news reporter Frank west?
---
Welcome to the club my dude
---
No it‚Äôs just that with a new perk it ‚Äúbrings back‚Äù the old legion
---
Ah. Haven‚Äôt looked at killer perks yet.
---
The perk is called nemesis and it looks like it‚Äôs gonna be really fun to use with other perks
---
And the remake skin. That outfit looks straight up evil.
---
Community is horrible and encourages it honestly
---
And I hate that map the most.
---
are you new to the game? just don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
a lot of this community is filled with people who don‚Äôt recognize the right idea. for example, if you‚Äôre lower rank than your teammates, it isn‚Äôt your fault. it is the matchmaking system that creates the problem.
---
otherwise just keep going. as long as you don‚Äôt play scummy you should be fine. no matter what you do, there will always be that one person calling you names.
---
listen to constructive criticism, not ‚Äúgit gud noob ez‚Äù because those people are awful.

---
Yep! Looking back on it, they must‚Äôve been hinting at it because of it
---
Yah Bhvr can‚Äôt do that‚Äôs Bhvr stated that Gordon causes to much emotional damage and psychological damage to be a killer
---
I hate this with a fucking passion
---
Killer queu is instant for me, survivor queu takes 5 mins..
---
Oh, 100%. This game had around 50 ping and I can tell you I would have died at the very beginning if it was not there.
---
Feels like I get the same maps all the time. I played *all* day yesterday and the only map I got that wasn‚Äôt the Macmillan estate, the wreckers or the cornfield was Hawkin‚Äôs lab, and that‚Äôs because I used an offering!
---
Wasn‚Äôt this exact post already posted
---
I definitely agree that legion should be more viable but I don‚Äôt think reverting them back to their old version will just have more people mad and then they‚Äôll get nerfed again
---
He is...
---
#**BAM BAM**
---
God*DAMN*
---
man remember that time they planned on making nes jason his own unique jason and not just a skin
---
i remember
---
:(
---
What console? I can wait with you
---
Honestly who cares, he's stronger now but there's play around to his moonwalk this time around, if devs nerf it's gonna be a huge mistake
---
what the actual fuck , that was so intense
---
15 minutes to que in for a game of killer, wouldnt be an issue if i wasnt a student
---
This could be in r/MeIRL
---
I definitely think the devs are gonna try to do something considering how much the survivor hated the previous legion
---
i wonder if it's a no mercy reference
---
That so insulting to Bill that poor grandpa is going to get Nam flashback but this is a pretty good cosmetic now can we get Christmas sweater for all the killer especially Michael and clown and the Oni
---
Using Nemesis Perk or Dark Devotion
---
they pallet slam you then they become obsession and Legion has no terror radius to that survivor 
---
so then legion can actively chase that survivor while their mend timer goes down and you either bleed out or get downed by an M1
---
I agree with that to the old legion was not healthy for the game but I dont think they should make them so easily countered. Especially since countering the oni seems very map reliant right now and both killers are going to be played a lot more when the new chapter comes out.
---
Just realised it now dont have good sight and was like oh shit wow look at that
---
playstation my dude
---
This pretty sick it super good take my upvote good work
---
No I don‚Äôt think a killer turning my perk into a liability is necessarily broken. I consider that part of the risk of running a perk. See OoO right now for an example. Huge liability if killer is wraith or Ghostface. Many killers have powers that make certain perks poor choices. DS is incredibly powerful and currently carries very low risk. Nemesis changes that. While I don‚Äôt use DS, I think that‚Äôs a good thing. 
---
It‚Äôs not about removing stuns from the game I don‚Äôt know where you came up with that. Perks that change things up and make traditionally safe plays carry risk is not horrible. Spirit Fury and Haunted Ground say hi.
---
Why‚Äôs it such a bad thing that a killer‚Äôs power+perk synergy encourages dropping pallets early and generally trying to avoid stunning the killer? It‚Äôs not like you never would want to stun legion. Makes it situational.
---
Because Asian
---
Really makes me wish there was an entity or spawn/son of entity (whatever you wanna call it) killer. Just a malevolent, amorphous being of darkness that slowly envelopes you until death.
---
No need to announce you have a vag, over half the population does &amp; prob half this sub does as well üôÑ
---
Whatever they change his blood fury MUST be better than billy‚Äôs chainsaw or he‚Äôll just be worthless
---
He's getting a Christmas sweater.
---
I did it the first try but at what cost? No one on my team made it against the rank 15 Ghostface.
---
Yikes. Getting into this game is seriously too much work. 150 hours and i'm still working on killer teachables, Don't even wanna think about survivors. And playing killers without bbq feels bad. 
---
I feel like i will truely enjoy the game only when i get a solid build on all killers and 1 survivor. If we didnt have 5 levels of Rarity for addons/offerings and 3 tiers for skills it would feel a lot less excruciating
---
Oh no a survivor is starting to look at me better move behind this wall. Surely I wont get spotted. Oh, what's that? The Killer Instinct prompt clearly shows they spotted me through a solid object? Ghostface op, I guess.
---
I want to see Michael wearing a Christmas sweater so much
---
Is this the real life?
---
DUDE, WHAT THE FLIP? ARE THERE NO OLD HALLOWEEN OUTFITS ON THE STORE? CHECK WRAITH OR HUNTRESS FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN BUY THEIR FLIPPING OOZING YELLOW GOO SKINS WITH THE SERUM CURRENCY THAT YOU GET.  
---
  
---
THERE SHOULD BE A FEW MORE FOR BOTH SURVIVORS AND KILLERS THAT YOU CAN GET, NO NEED TO WAIT FOR AN EVENT.
---
Im one of those bros. I kind of like not having the toxic chat though
---
Give me your psn and I'll friend you
---
Yeah definitely. Legion shouldn‚Äôt be broken like before but they also shouldn‚Äôt be nerfing them even harder
---
But they did make it in time...
---
I welcome suicides to disconnects.
---
Pop quiz: How long's it take to beat a moron to death? (buzzer imitation) Sorry, times up, you're dead.
---
I don‚Äôt know I find somewhat cute that killer are cold too especially Michael imagine Michael wearing a tore festive sweater like he stole it off someone
---
Bleed out timer only goes down if you‚Äôre not in Legions Terror Radius. Since it makes someone oblivious, it counts as not being in the TR, which means for 45 seconds you will bleed even if the legion is chasing you.
---
Combine that with just one frenzy hit to reduce the timer and it‚Äôs more than enough to force bleed out.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve gathered from it anyway.
---
K
---
It's running pretty good right now for me but usually as a survivor (main) it takes me what feels like hours
---
The point is, you can deep wounds a survivor, bait out a stun and then follow them without them having a terror radius, causing the deep wounds timer to tick down
---
There were so many good ones from the pyro section of voice lines. Since scout is the only person to make fun of pyro strictly for his inability to talk through the mask
---
üëç
---
Resist the urge to run around the same pallet for 30 minutes and suddenly none of this becomes an issue.
---
I love the ‚ÄúMmMmMM‚Äù it‚Äôs just so good
---
virgin BAM BAM vs chad BONK
---
yeah dude. That Oni going right up tier A when it comes to sexiness
---
Quite the asskisser, is he.
---
bubba has cosmetics, you just have to hook survivors to get them.....oh wait.
---
Well, Haddonfield and Badham both have nasty loops that are near infinites. Going around the preschool requires no pallets. Gideon meat plant has TONS of safe pallets that you just have to throw down, and the killer HAS to break it, or totally break off any chase to go around. If the killer breaks it, that leaves you time to put distance and potentially drop bloodlust. The map often has many ways TO break chase. Almost every shack can be used to loop efficiently for a minute plus, and it's often used to loop killers relatively safely. Not to Mention Fractured Cowshed, Thompson House, Torment Creek, Ironworks of Misery all of which can have a ton of loops survivors can run without needing to use pallets. Any map that can spawn Jungle Gyms, LT walls, and whatever else. Even maps that don't heavily favor survivors you can just throw pallets down early. I've seen plenty of survivors break chase at such pallets while the killer is trying to decide what to do. This new aspect of Legion is going to rely as heavily on RNG map setups as ever before, but now he'll have the ability to break certain loops.
---
Almost each of those I've mentioned have a high chance of spawning loops that require 0 pallets, and some have loops that don't require pallets at all. Plenty of those maps also have god windows that killers will just instantly break off chase when you head near it. If Legion can now capitalize on such situation, I'm all in favor. I think god windows and near infinites are horrible map design.
---
Better than No Mither.
---
ü§°
---
Wait, you mean everyone else doesn't do this with the alpha female?
---
Duuuuuuuude 
---
Now I really want that
---
Left4dead is one of my favourite games
---
That's me for sure
---
FINALLY SOMONE DID IT
---
Can the oni even jump because of how thicc he is?
---
If a survivor is baited out more than once, that's their own fault. And now if survivors see Legion, they'll should go "shit let me throw these down early because he might have a specific perk". And like I said, plenty of loops and map setups can waste a ton of time, be used to break chase, and don't require pallets.
---
Just run me my L cause i‚Äôm not dealing with that shit
---
Ok? I was just explaining what the original commenter said.
---
He was the killer.

What they mean is that it brings back the moonwalk strat.

Only on level II of the Tome I.
---
They actually updated her character description. 
---
She's no longer a focused focuser who can quickly switch focus. :'(

&gt;It's only practical in a 1v1 chase, that's about it.

What other kind of chases are there in DBD exactly?

Just like my weekend :)

I don't have an explanation either

I don't understand why this is getting so heavily downvoted....

I honestly enjoyed reading this. It was enjoyable :)
---
controller so I'm gonna assume ps4 share
---
ayyyy Hellsing abridged, nice one
---
It's posted every new chapter but you're good for now
---
Nah. Just thought it would be a funny post. I play both killer and survivor. Thought about doing one for killers who DC as well but already got bored with the idea.
---
I WAS CALLED TRASH FOR EQUIPPING NOED, EVEN THOUGH I KILLED THEM ALL BEFORE IT EVEN ACTIVATED
---
You're all going to hell for lewding this pure game
---
Update: I got it, finally, 7 odd hours of play later. Only because 2 survivors DC'd and the Spirit took pity on us. Thank you Spirit, you wonderful wonderful person.
---
Yes, but the clap of his ass cheeks alerts the survivors.
---
Yes and since Exhausting doesn't go down when you are running is it really strong.  
---
The Hemorage Part is just meh.
---
Love the new hatch cosmetic! The devs are geniuses :)
---
I couldn‚Äôt care less who you choose to watch, and I don‚Äôt play Swf ever, much less with the intent to bully. Swf has no way to bully new killers anyway unless they use smurf accounts. It seems to me like you aren‚Äôt actually reading anything I‚Äôm saying and are instead looking for a fight. Wanna know what‚Äôs weird to me? The guy talking an awful lot about bullying new killers is the one with a smurf account, that‚Äôs shady as fuck
---
I know, but I want it ASAP because I‚Äôm nearing 1M bp (I was trying to get ready for a T3 survivor but I don‚Äôt have enough iridescent (not blood shards) to buy it. Plus I want the cosmetics which most likely will cost auric
---
yeah i agree, but that‚Äôs the thing, people don‚Äôt play the game normally and that‚Äôs why people get bullied and why the game can be fucked sometimes.
---
He had to go. His planet needed him.
---
I guess the same reason Ash would wear a sweater covered in Necronomicons
---
The person I responded to was being sarcastic about the Legion complaints from the tone. They were saying that even with this perk it still takes about a minute after you get stunned/blinded for the perk to drop the person being chase. This means that their team still have a minute+ to finish a generator or two before the survivor being chase is even downed. The tone seemed to be saying that people are whining about this manageable in-no-way-op or anything like old Legion with the 5+ min mend, while a Billy or Nurse can insta-down you or just ignore loops altogether. If people are going to disconnect over this Legion build, it's pretty laughable.
---
I was just trying to clarify the timing of the perk in question.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Mirror myers can make is work tho.
---
I really really like this, good shit they need to just dump the whole deep wound shit. Literally make this killer a high tier killer than can simply counter loops easily.
---
Halo reach is only 10$ if you buy only it. You can buy the full Master chief collection for 60 though
---
Because the legion are the worst thing ever added to the game and the developers keep giving them cool stuff. Legion was designed to only sell skins.
---
Honestly I think other Killers need some love too. Give them all Christmas sweaters or give none of them Christmas sweaters
---
camping and tunneling is scummy. it disables the other person from playing the game as intended, which teaches killers that they don‚Äôt need to be good to win. i understand if a survivor was t-bagging and being completely toxic but holy shit i can‚Äôt even count the amount of times i merely vaulted a window and it was toxic enough to get face camped for. i play both sides (not as often as i‚Äôd like due to matchmaking) but i‚Äôm proud to say i can get plenty of kills without forcing a de-pip on some poor survivor.
---
I agree, and happy cake day.
---
There are some maps that don‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs mainly indoor ones, but some outdoor ones do it. I personally have never seen a middle of nowhere totem
---
Oh shit it‚Äôs my cake day?
---
Now don't spend money next rift, only buy it if you got far enough that you can justify

---
give every killer a warm sweater WHY the legion has cool skins but all killer need love a huntress sweatshirt wouldn‚Äôt have been CUTE
---
I play both and it's 5 min survivor, 15 min killer
---
Cewl
---
I think they were changed on the ptb to activate on any survivor hit after the first. So you can give the status to 3 survivors, all hit one time, just not the first guy
---
they definitely do have the intent to bully killers, and most of the swf i go against that‚Äôs exactly what they try to do. how am i not reading anything you‚Äôre typing if i‚Äôm responding to every bit you‚Äôre responding to me with, i‚Äôm not looking for a fight, if i were to say i think it would be you looking for the fight being you were the one to respond to me in the first place, i‚Äôm not going to get childish so i‚Äôm going to ignore that, okay? cool. i use a smurf account to be able to have relaxing games and not have to tryhard every game because a swf is trying to be toxic or a killer is trying to be toxic. when i am on my smurf account i play like a rank 20, i let them kill me, down me, i dont let them chase me for very long, etc. it‚Äôs not shady when i can show you gameplay of me literally running around acting like a rank 20. it still seems to me you‚Äôre very upset by things i have said, for what? i dont know, only you know. oh, and back to not answering people, it seems to be you not reading or answering fully because you didn‚Äôt even respond to me if you were aggravated or not. i‚Äôm done ‚Äúarguing‚Äù with you being this was a simple conversation but you decided to escalate it, so have a nice rest of your night or day, wherever you live.
---
for me it's actually the other way around, weird
---
Way to clean up these streets. People forget that this game is about having fun.
---
console? because on playstation its the other way around for me
---
Tunneling is playing the game as intended, there‚Äôs no strategic reason to not tunnel unless they have perks. You‚Äôre not entitled to being let free.
---
Why so salty?
---
Its PlayStation
---
damn I would be happy to get into a lobby in five minutes as a survivor
---
Would you like to have a chat with r/dbdgonewild?
---
RAH!
---
No that is misinformation doctor, wraith leatherface ect will never be able to put the same pressure on survivors as the killers you mentioned
---
They're gonna meet a bunch of Legions with Nemesis, dont worry.
---
The new kindred effect is bugged on the switch.  It straight doesn't show anyone at all while another survivor is on a hook
---
Commit die
---
Me neither!

oh, you used spirit

This is art.

There‚Äôs still a lot of differences. Hell Jason only uses bear traps in the remake and in the game.

**New Perk:** *Bodacious Strike*
---
Succeed a skill check while grabbed by the killer to crack them over the head with your skateboard and stun them for the rest of the fucking match.
---
Time to lobby dodge
---
was expecting you to use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSczFOqFUrc) at least once
---
They can make terror radius still exists, but it is now muted. That will get rid of old legion but still keep the jumpscare potential.
---
Some of these toxic people need to actually kill themselves and let the world be a slightly better place. I really don't understand what compels so many of them to act the way they do in a video game
---
I want this to be an actual asymmetrical game now.
---
I feel like as a someone who plays both Killer and Survivor, this is a good change. Without all the lobby dodging I can actually play matches much faster. Remember at the end of the day that the goal should be to have fun, not just win. And so if you complain about not being able to doge lobbies, I‚Äôm not sure what to tell you.
---
with add ons and perks doctor can practically make skill checks impossible. his fake pallet perks are a godsend and if you know how to use shock therapy it‚Äôs hard to loop him.
---
wraith is the perfect example of a killer who becomes amazing with add ons. all seeing blood + swift hunt blood, all seeing spirit + windstorm blood etc. are great examples of that.
---
leatherface is a killer where perks help a lot. though it‚Äôs scummy, insidious basement bubba is very deadly and discordance + monitor &amp; abuse allows him to mow down survivors.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy when you realize you just have to pop it, not actually do it all. Grabbing a survivor from a gen, now that‚Äôs hard.
---
INCREDIBLIS!
---
Yes and unless you que up with 2 friends there is no way of knowing if that rank 20 isn‚Äôt playing swf with a friend.
---
I would think blood echo would be far better
---
Still doesn‚Äôt compete with a good nurse with all the best add ons and leather face is useless against swf as he has to camp and they just won‚Äôt get the person on the hook
---
Remember to randomly trap vault locations too. Outside the window of the killer Shack is almost one hundred percent guaranteed to get triggered every game, there's always grass there.
---
Survivor: uses dead hard
---
Oni:uses demon dash 
---
Survivor: b**** WTF
---
Again, this is not a pay to win model, this is a grind elimination. Whether you bought the perks or grinded to get them, they are exactly the same.
---
If the bought perk gave you extra effects, now THAT would be pay to win. What I'm suggesting is the shrine of secrets for real money on a larger scale
---
&gt; They actually listen to the community
---
*and other fun jokes you can tell your friends!*
---
The new perk in the picture, Nemesis, makes it so that: if you get stunned by a pallet (and I think there are other conditions but I'm not 100% on that), the survivor that did it becomes your obsession and gives the obsession the oblivious effect. This means that the mend timer for your obsession will run down even if in a chase because they have no terror radius, I think that's the mechanics of it.
---
Apparently they are gonna rework them again after a few more killers
---
u/vredditdowloader
---
Way too far dude. Of course you got banned. Just report them and move on. You can't send pictures of self harm.
---
Oh my (‡∏á Õ° ò Õú ñ Õ° ò)‡∏á yes please
---
tunneling is a confusing subject due to misinformation but if you literally don‚Äôt go after ANYONE else that is scummy and again, teaches killers that they don‚Äôt need to be good to win. it lets them think ‚Äúcool, i can‚Äôt put enough pressure on the other survivors, time to tunnel.‚Äù there‚Äôs a difference in making the game unplayable for the other side and winning vs. being able to win without playing like an ass.
---
Must be nice ;(
---
The strategic reason is to apply pressure to multiple survivors rather than chasing one survivor for 5 gens and getting 1 kill.
---
That is exactly why he does it
---
Scary rank 16s. I'm terrified.
---
I started playing after Legion was released and fixed, but I have heard streamers from ye olden days say it was like having old Legion back. Personally I don't know how devs will fix it since the problem is how deep wound works and they can't change Nemesis because of that one interaction.
---
LERY'S MEMRIAL INSTITUTE IS THE BEST
---
I agree, Sir. Have you read the gospel that is r/dbdgonegay?
---
well i‚Äôm not saying that shit tier killers can just immediately become great but you can get the same 4k with any killer.
---
NTA. But Jake was a big one.
---
Y e s
---
Thank you!
---
chriimah susie!!!
---
Probably a lot less after her rework comes in so it won‚Äôt be as annoying
---
&gt;It looked like a Blimp didn't know it was a silo.
---
Billy's maps and lore are all farm related. Its only logical that this would be a silo even though it looks like a Blimp.
---
I'm guessing you never sat down and played a game as him have you?
---
yeah, I was running off of the summery someone wrote without reading the actual thing. Thats scary powerful when combined with furtive chase. If you rescue the obsession you become the obsession, which triggers onis perk.
---
It literally does and that is why it always confused me when people tell me otherwise lol.
---
I think my switch might blow up after the update XD
---
If you're going to spend on cosmetics, do that, spend as little BP as you can to stay under 1M until you can get one of the two characters.
---
i bet they are only calling it a bug cause ppl kept leaving lobbys when they see a high rank
---
Maybe, I just know my skill checks were still hard af lol
---
It ain't battle pass tho, and you can still survive and kill all four survivors with basic perks.
---
That's clever. They both think they're chasing each other.
---
Sabo or slug for 4K isn‚Äôt toxic either.
---
If you‚Äôre only in a position to chase on person then tunneling is objectively better than chasing someone with no hooks
---
Typical business practice: they want money.
---
I waited until all were on sale when ST was released and got all licensed ones for like, $27 total (including ST). But the rest I've picked up with shards.
---
no one said it was
---
Nope, people said it about the 3 gens too. I'm on mobile right now but if you want proof I can link you several posts when I'm at my PC.
---
WHY DO I FIND YUI SO ATTRACTIVE !? IS SOMETHING ERONG WITH ME I SAVED UP SHARDS FOR ONI BUT NOW I WANT TO SPEND 5 DOLLARS ON YUI JUST BECAUSE I THINK SHE IS HOT IM FUCKING DISGUSTED BY MYSELF
---
Sounds fucking awesome dude. I love this idea
---
Just had a game where I was the only Rank 8 with all Rank 16's.
---
Solo survivor. How is it fair to me to go into these matches unknowingly and destroy low ranked survivors and killers instead of either showing me their shit matchmaking or fixing it
---
Running around stabbing everyone is the fun part of playing Legion. Your proposed changes would make for an extremely boring killer.
---
Why would you buy everything at full price and not wait for sales that happen pretty often?
---
This... Does put a smile on my face
---
&gt;Typical business practice: they want money.
---
How dare them!
---
The way it works is that it marks the gen for longer. So basically it's easier to tell if they got off the gen with the shorter duration.
---
You can camp the basement from anywhere lmao
---
Not me lawl. 
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a few weeks because the last time it was literally a buzzkill. 
---
Literally I smoked a fat joint, sat down and waiting to play and I was almost sober again.

You‚Äôre right they keep mistaking that chair with that pile or clothes is the other so when they see it BAM clothes everywhere and a broken chair
---
Hilarious dick move
---
It really is. Plenty of times I‚Äôm like how tf did they not reveal me. And then I get revealed through a crack in a wall 20 feet away.
---
Just put all 3 legions in the basement lockers so the survivors have nowhere to hide. Except the back 2 and one of them is going to get caught.
---
Played him plenty, I don't like him and he's not fun to play because of how easy he is. People like to stroke their hard 2 inches while they talk about how much skill he takes but he's incredibly simple to do well on.
---
I play on Xbox and my killer queues are much shorter than searching as a solo survivor. I usually play around 11pm-1am so maybe that's why. It really sucks since the last 3 achievements I need are for survivors. :(
---
I need to re-meme this as a sobering experience for killers.
---
From the way your talking it doesn't sound like you have. I've barely played him and could barely get a 4k not to mention that his saw becomes almost useless in some loops. Also some maps seem to really screw him over.
---
Seriously. All I'm seeing is a huge nerf and a gimmicky perk combo that isn't going to last beyond the PTB because the devs had no idea it was going to interact that way.
---
STOP üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Shit Legion fucking is inevitable, this is gonna keep happening, and Legion's never gonna be balanced right until they get a full rework.
---
They'll always be boring and unfun for one side or the other, and I hate it because I love the concept, and I love playing them. I just know they could be great but we're stuck with the wasted opportunity that they are.
---
Why am I not surprised to see you again complaining about the nerf?
---
Yeah. It feels like the gimmick with Legion is that they're
---
a) a group (which currently isn't really represented in game at all)
---
b) they're normal humans, without any fancy powers or abilities (which is sort of represented by the fact that their power is entirely mundane, but it brings to the forefront the question of why these random teens can inflict a wound that's worse than any other killer with far more internal damage when like everyone else should be able to do it too)
---
Deep Wounds itself isn't really present in any way in the design (nothing about their appearance suggests their power is inflicting extra internal damage,) and it very much seems that Deep Wounds was either an afterthought or a holdover from another earlier killer design that was reused. 
---
They don't play into either that "I'm literally just a survivor with a knife" aspect (besides vaulting pallets I guess?) or that "we're not one, we're many" aspect with Deep Wounds.
---
You seem like such a whiny person.
---
Is Special Edition on pc? I know its the only version of the game available on consoles but it comes with Nea/Nurse, Feng Min/Doctor, Ace/Hag, and David/Huntress already unlocked
---
Eh kinda, but a killer cant have everything. Sometimes you just gotta take the faults in stride
---
&gt;You realize you can unlock original characters with playtime, right? Or is that also too much to ask?
---
And do you realize it takes around 100-130h (or so) to unlock 1 character?
---
You can give it to the first guy too if he finishes mending before your power ends, very possible now with the added speed and decreased mend time.
---
So you‚Äôre not allowed to pallet stun or flashlight blind a legion ever for the off chance he has nemesis? That‚Äôs not balanced. That‚Äôs a bandaid fix. It‚Äôs like the spirit. Just ‚Äústay still‚Äù. It definitely shouldn‚Äôt stay that way. And a good legion will try everything in his power to get stunned if he has the perk.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but cap is not a baby survivor
---
I hope that the Dwight one makes jingles noises.
---
I love to camp and tunnel those shit killers that camps and tunnels, funny enough they get triggered as well, what will that be?
---
When does new chapter come out on console
---
I guess, it buys you like an extra 20 seconds so there's that.
---
Dude that one is hell for some reason like they know im a trapper but always go for that fucking window. Roll out the lolz
---
You're giving the devs too much credit. They had no idea the perk was going to work like that for them and it isn't going to make it off the PTB. I don't even want it to because it's just gimmicky bullshit that sounds really fucking boring to play. They just thought they were buffing Legion because there are other Killers that like having their ability not count as a hit. That's why the rest of the changes are very slight buffs. Either that or they don't care and fully intended the huge nerf on a low tier killer. One thing for sure though they didn't intend the nemesis perk to work for Legion like this.
---
I watched that video of that streamer playing the oni and screaming that at every instance he hit anyone with his club. Safe to say I will only watch no commentary gameplay for new characters
---
starmanness?
---
N-nani?!
---
&gt;And do you realize it takes around 100-130h (or so) to unlock 1 character?
---
So? You are getting something completely for free and you want it unlocked within 10 hours of play time? 
---
Besides, grinding levels on DBD is not like it requires you to divert from the path of normal gameplay. If you play DBD long enough, you'll find yourself at Devotion 1 sooner or later and at this point, you'll be able to buy 2 characters and almost a third one.
---
Don't worry, the game will be just as toxic in a few weeks when the console players get access.
---
Honestly, completely possible these were separate changes and they were just tone-deaf twice over. I can't wait for Project Resistance to come out so BHVR has to actually get competitive instead of coasting on a genre monopoly.
---
Not really. While he can't do his bullshit 360 around the map, Lery's and Hawkins both have long corridors to traverse the whole map. The Game is pretty open and easy on the top floor at least.
---
This whole circlejerk about "wow loops sure beat him!" thing is pathetic. Plenty of people play plenty of M1 killers well at red ranks, and none of them have the ability to cross the map in seconds or one hit down just because there isn't a window or pallet within 2 meters, and half the time when there is he can hit through them anyway.
---
He isn't subject to loops in the same way as other strong killers who get penalised with 110 movespeed for LESS mobile powers, he has no cooldowns, no real punishment for failing his ability, and his only counter-play is "cross your fingers and hope he doesn't turn the same direction you do."
---
No other killer has add ons like turning ones that literally just remove the part of his power that's meant to make it difficult to use. The only other killer who has an add on as all-encompassing as the carby guide just lost it (the yakuyoke amulet) so he still never actually has to pick a stat to buff because EVERYTHING is.
---
I'm a killer main, I regularly sit in red ranks even playing Plague when she doesn't pip on a 4k with 12 hooks, [I've played every killer to a significant degree.](https://i.imgur.com/IHPvxF7.png) The people who parrot "BiLlY iS tHe MoSt BaLaNcEd KiLlEr" are lying to themselves because they don't want easy mode taken away.
---
Only they're telling their SWF group your every move so they can just avoid you and rush gens.
---
If you're talking about the"interrupt a survivor" challenge, you don't have to grab them off a gen--you can also grab from an unhook or pallet vault. I got the challenge after doing only those types of grabs in a match.
---
The base game is so cheap. The DLC adds up to a bit pricey but most of the survivors and killers can be grinded for free, though it would take awhile
---
Also waiting for when DLC go on sale is a good way to save money
---
Swf always know what you're doing anyways.
---
They now apply to the survivors hit after the 1st during frenzy, but they're only a 60 second duration so it's really not that big a deal. Making someone broken for 60 seconds is honestly more of a detriment than a blessing because instead of wasting time on an extended heal they'll just work a gen.
---
stonks
---
Although to be fair, they don't MAKE you pay $110; you just have to pay about 40% that to have all the characters/perks, and grind for hundreds of hours to get the others without paying.
---
Yeah I know. Still was hard tho. Had to farm with a survivor to get it. Same with the bear trap one, but that one was because I was getting bad maps and just wanted to get over it.
---
Yeah, for every decent person there's a shithead. It's kind of the equilibrium of the community, ya'know? 
---
I've been playing the PTB lately and I haven't seen any toxicity on there though. :)
---
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO FIX THE PLACEHOLDER TRAPPER TRAP-SETTING ANIMATION? IT'S BEEN FOREVER.
---
Worst part about his power is that it points the direction of who is spotting you. 
---
Other times I‚Äôm trying to watch out and hide in a bush, then bam, he knows where i am.
---
I generally don't give a shit unless the game is really frustrating or annoying. If I'm playing survivor and the killer is on my ass the entire game and I can't do anything or of I'm playing killer and the survivors are all blendettes that I can never find I'll be pretty upset but if I do a gen or two or get some hooks but just die because the others were good at the game I'll be just fine with it.
---
lol. A fresh me me
---
Survivors DC against every killer so it won‚Äôt change much
---
Wait and watch for the licensed DLC to go on sale like they did when ST released. I got all the licensed DLC including ST for $27 during that sale.
---
Be patient with blood shards. I've picked up Spirit and Legion, saving for Hag next, then Doctor and Plague (might wait on those for Oni first though).
---
You don't have to blow through money in this game to enjoy it and play at a high level.
---
100 hours of your time isn't "completely for free," and it's not generosity when it AFFECTS GAMEPLAY.
---
And the method of grinding doesn't justify the amount required, although the current system is ONLY gameplay time mattering, but cutting off at 10 minutes, so it's Survivor-favoring and would reward AFKs, so that also sucks.
---
And for the cherry on top, Devotion still does nothing.
---
Think that your mad because people dont cleanse against you so you basically have no power past a certain point so your taking it out on a killer who's power can always be useful.
---
Lawbringer Rep 27 here!
---
You seem like a whale. What's your point?
---
I am 99% sure it's exactly that. Is project resistance that Resident Evil game? Definitely not looking like my cup of tea tbh.
---
Nea/Nurse are free on PC, as are David/Huntress when manually collected, but Doctor's and Hag's DLCs must be bought separately.
---
I got it first try by pretending to want to farm and then yoinking a Survivor off a gen when they weren't expecting it. Brought the ol' BPS to make it more worthwhile for them to tolerate my shenanigans.
---
Salty killer: Nerf dead hard and rng unhooks !
---
In my opinion, you only need some DLC, if you want to play as specific killers, whose abilities and strengths differ a lot. 
---
I've never really touched any DLC survivor myself, I couldn't care less about them and their perks - you can only equip 4 perks anyway and you get most of the best ones with the base game.
---
If you're patient, it's probably better to wait for it in the shrine. You'll save IRL money, BP, and only miss out on a low-tier Killer, a slugging perk, and Franklin's Bully Counter.
---
I'm not mad, I just hate people who cover their ears and pretend something's balanced because they like their free easy kills. I enjoy playing Plague, so whatever orifice you pulled that out of, you can shove it straight back up.
---
Perhapse, we shall see
---
Karma 100
---
I mean you can help teammates but it‚Äôs not something you have to do. 
---
Yeah do what you can when you can but some survivors make you wanna leave them lol.
---
It is. And I can understand that. It's still in beta, so it looks rough in general, but it's also action/horror instead of slasher-based, and has an RTS-ish solo side, which is virtually the opposite of DbD's Killers.
---
Have you tried Identity V? It's got its faults, but it's free and does a lot of things surprisingly better than DbD for a knockoff.
---
Bam Bam
---
And people enjoy playing billy I agree that his addons are a bit much but any good survivor would notice him running across a field and easily move out of the way. And I admit plague is insanely fun to play but her power does rarely come into play as well so I tend to avoid her props to you if you can make it work.
---
I still think it's good, no longer the #1 exhaustion perk. But not bad.
---
Before you could use it to bait hits and for distance but now you can only use it for distance. I hope they fix it.
---
Crossplay is on only for pc between steam and microsoft store. But I think the devs are looking into it
---
I got the game for free because of PS+ so I only had to pay for the dlc characters
---
This is the worst totem placement in the history of totem placements maybe ever.
---
I don't know i played killer from 3am to 7am now and it was easier for me to find lobbys as a killer
---
How so? It would just need a slightly different animation and doesn't require you to do much, just simply struggle for a short amount of time
---
You want one?
---
Oh thanks for the tip! Still, I feel if I took a bit on removing a killer it‚Äôs either gonna be Freddy or spirit, but that time won‚Äôt come so I‚Äôll just keep on dreaming
---
I wonder what it is about this subreddit that attracts people on the left of the bell curve. I mean, seriously, I‚Äôve never seen another community with such a startling number of people that seem to be lacking some crucial thinking skills.
---
Of course!
---
onii chan im vibing, please
---
If having played the game for almost 2 years and buying all the Chapters during that time makes me a whale then yes, i'm a big one.
---
You are clearly one extremely entitled person thinking that just because you buy the game for 20 dollars means you shouldn't have to pay a single dime for anything and be given everything for free, absolutely disgusting behaviour.
---
If you go into struggle, the next time you would be hooked, you would be dead. Deliverance is supposed to get you off the hook before struggle so I wouldn‚Äôt add the escaping hook during struggle.
---
Haven't heard of that one. I'll give it a look.
---
A few people have thought of it, dunno if anyone‚Äôs actually tried it though. It looks like it could be disgusting, especially combined with fragrant tuft
---
They definitely shouldn't remove them and they won't anyways yeah. I think its pretty balanced when it comes to how often you face a specific killer. Also the meta changes depending on rank, so maybe just pip up or depip?
---
it actually sounds really cute hearing her footsteps its just a quite *pat pat pat pat* like if a dog was coming towards you lmao
---
I think it‚Äôs a sound from Stardew Valley
---
In Australia it takes 5-6 mins on a good day..... 15-20 on a bad one to get a lobby as killer... then you wait for people to come and go. :&lt;
---
Few people who record gameplay would play that build. Only people you‚Äôll find are those in a kyf match, especially since the queues on ptb are so bad
---
Good thing about bags is that you have more traps available in the map. Beacuse the traps that spawn are the same everytime
---
Should be 20 seconds
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
I get dcs at least once every 3 match and I play people like clown and Ghostface. Slap them once and they just DC
---
I‚Äôve never played Myers, gimme a rundown on the addons being talked about
---
Your art is really amazing!
---
Deliverance does not need a buff.
---
The explanation the devs gave in your link?
---
It seems every time I equip Deliverance, I get hooked first. But at the same time, I think the perk is fine as is. Luck is just as much a part of the game as skill, so sometimes you just happen to be the first person the killer sees, and if you're not great at looping (i'm terrible at it), well that's just a perk that gets wasted. It happens. I personally wouldn't mind this sort of change though, but I feel like it also has too many elements to it.
---
&gt; us Microsoft store users
---
Why u do dis?
---
Only if the survivor was clearly skilled without being toxic. Or a complete noob that shouldn‚Äôt ever be in a match with me. For the talented survivor I‚Äôll find us just kinda staring at eachother once in a while and it‚Äôs almost like we have a language, we communicate from the other side of that pallet/window. And with the baby survivors I just wanna give them a good game so they‚Äôll stick around long enough to learn to kick my ass
---
i love it TT\_\_TT
---
The number you came up for extra characters (19) got me wondering if that was actually the case. Turns out, there are only 12 DLCs available on steam store (not counting Ash since he doesn't add a killer and not counting Chapter 14).

I would love to do it, but it‚Äôs locked for everyone but admins
---
In order to get adept do you have to get 4 iridescent emblems and escape with only their 3 teachable perks ? Or just escape with the perks ?
---
Like someone already said, Crossplay is only between steam and the microsoft store on PC. The Devs are totally working on crossplay between all consoles and PC but that is going to take a long time. Could easily be a year of waiting.
---
I ran it a few times today with both types of Tombstone as well as Fragrant tuft. It's insane how quick you can get T3 up by forcing a stun anytime ur not chasing the obsession. Can't wait for it to hit live!
---
Dbd used to look a hundred times better. I have no idea what changes they did to mess that up
---
That took me forever to do
---
The oni kills because smebody put him a nickname.
---
I too have found joy in the trapper, he is the only killer ive played were hearing people get caught in traps is the most satisfying noise,  as opposed to going against him and either being trapped or other trapped is the most soul crushing especially if it's trappers basement.
---
‚ÄúConsiderably increases the rate at which evil is gained when stalking the obsession‚Äù  numbers are I think 33% and when added with the add on that moderately increases stalking on all survivors which is 22% that‚Äôs 155%...... an INSANE amount of speed to be stalking at.
---
Considering that it becomes a waste of a perk slot if you get hooked first, I think it needs at least something else so your not suddenly playing with only 3 perks, this version would also help get people to unhook more often (they do have to be safe unhooks) and benefiting the unhooked survivor and yourself in the process
---
They‚Äôve toned down those loops multiple times just don‚Äôt bother chasing survivors when they run there. Your best bet is giving up on protecting the generator in there and patrol other ones
---
Doctor killed people way before he was in the realm. He was a psychotic doctor
---
Had the same thing yesterday, don't bother even reading, one day you will smack them.
---
I actually didn't know which game the character came from. I just thought he looked like a mix of Keanu Reeves and Hagrid. I posted this on r/memes first and got a tip to post it in this subreddit, and that's how it ended up here.
---
Well beast of prey still exists
---
Yoooo I loved this. This was fun to read, I think Chanel would be hilarious and awesome to have in game. Zayday is just as awesome. Those would be my two pics but, if there was only one character allowed, I think Chanel would be more appropriate.
---
It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs that they want to do it right. They can‚Äôt do cosmetics every month as that would take an insane amount of time and what else can they do? A lot of red rank players don‚Äôt give a shit about bloodpoints because they have perks unlocked already and make way more than they spend. Shards are likewise useless for anyone that plays this game a lot. So what could they do that wouldn‚Äôt just get them a sarcastic ‚Äúway to go, such a great system guys‚Äù?
---
Baby dweets
---
I‚Äôd move Amanda to kill because she enjoys it. She literally rigged death traps to give ppl hope, just for it to be impossible to escape. I‚Äôd also move Ghostface to doesn‚Äôt mind killing or killing out of insanity. I‚Äôm not 100% familiar with this ghostface‚Äôs lore, but if you assume his motives are similar to the original ghost face (despite them not having the license to anything other than the mask) then he usually kills out of revenge. Although I sort of remember his lore and it may suggest he just liked killing, so maybe not.
---
LMAO thanks for this good laugh.
---
Play with your food, Rancor, Dark Devotion, certain add ons for Freddy/Myers.  Alone it is weak but when combined with Legion or anything above it is very dirty
---
I want chucky or pennywise
---
what's your point with saying it becomes a waste? it's meant to be risk vs reward. if you cant avoid being hooked first every game then maybe you shouldn't run the perk?
---
I totally agree with you, but it just sucks that you are essentially playing with 3 perks if you get hooked first, that and I mainly did it this way because it would help promote people to unhook if they run it, since once they get 3 safe unhooks they can unhook themself, even during the struggle phase, as well as quickly unhook and heal other survivors
---
4 pallets in 2 minutes at the end game? Personally I don't think that's wasting pallets but that's alright :)
---
was expecting dark souls meme with that title
---
Sometimes I feel like people shouldn‚Äôt use this sub until they reach green ranks at least. A lot of the time they listen to all the wrong people and come out with the opinion that everything is toxic and overpowered and that they need to do the things they do in retaliation. Not every time of course, but surprisingly often
---
I will commend you for the editing skill in that case.
---
Just the perks, so you can get lucky. It's how I ended up with the Laurie trophy in the end.
---
For a hot second, I thought that that Legion was Nea lmaoo. Was wondering why she had the red light.
---
‚ÄúThe survivors went that way!‚Äù
---
Thats how a ban works...
---
Thank you.
---
The thing nobody is going to tell you about that build is that Nemesis is on a sixty second cooldown and only works when someone who is not the obsession stuns/blinds you.
---
And I may be wrong here, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it only works once per survivor.
---
The legion build will be strong/annoying but at the end of the day just drop the pallet early or be the obsession. It‚Äôs just as counterable as Spirit Fury.
---
I would go more with psychopath, from everything said about him, it seems he knows what he does, he just doesn't cares and enjoys it.
---
3rd, 4th, 7th, and 32nd you mean?
---
Because it's not fair to players who don't want to carry one or two dead weight teammates.
---
Worse*
---
Imagine the stranger things mall as a map
---
Adrenaline only has value if your injured of being chased. Otherwise it just exhausts you. Regardless survivor has 3 perks all game
---
I would die for it omg
---
Not very kind of you. mister Leatherface!
---
I‚Äôd like to see where you got your numbers for average number of matches. That simply doesn‚Äôt line up with my experience at all. And I‚Äôd argue that the average match length is more like 10 minutes. Also, that‚Äôs enough to get 2.7 characters so once you correct your math you‚Äôll find that pretty damn close to what I said. I think you didn‚Äôt account for ‚Äúfirst X role match‚Äù bonuses either, as those add up pretty quick. It‚Äôs nowhere near 100h/killer. Even at your values it‚Äôs 72 hours per character and still leaving you 6,300 shards for shrine perks.
---
I play too much TF2, so whenever I hear any type of bonk, I can only understand one type of bonk
---
... Well fck. Thanks xd
---
Lol at all this mental gymnastics. If your take was this right you wouldn't have to write a paragraph. "Chain reaction" toxicity isn't a thing
---
Really strong perks shouldn't be working 100% of the time. And deliverance is one of them.
---
It's the same with adrenaline. Most times you don't get chased during the last Gen. Wasted perk slot.
---
Decisive strike: The killer doesn't tunnel you or he slugs you for the entire minute. Wasted perk slot.
---
Unbreakable: The killer picks you up immediately. Wasted perk slot.
---
I think you get what I mean. A very strong perk shouldn't be usable every match cause it would be too strong. Especially on survivor side. Since four people could use it.
---
I like your idea though. Would be cool as it's own perk. Just without the self-unhook.
---
I'd rather have longer queue times than ten shitty games in a row because my teammates are rank 20s
---
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY TOXIC PEOPLE ON THE PTB AND WHY DO THEY DISCONNECT WHEN THINGS DONT GO THEIR WAY? I WAIT 20 MIN IN LOBBY TO PLAY ONI ONLY TO HAVE ALL 4 PLAYERS DISCONNECT EARLY ON
---
Man, go watch a video of what‚Äôs happening. A legion can get themselves intentionally stunned by lunging at pallets, either they get stunned or you get hit and go down soon after. What you‚Äôre saying sounds good on paper but doesn‚Äôt hold up to actual tests

I just want them to get more skins, like what we have so far but I'll take more either edgelord stuff, or have them go the opposite route and get more "human" stuff (for Susie at least please Behavior)
---
And a lot of people would rather have a game with shitty teammates over waiting 45 minutes to have even a chance of finding a match you can play, that has 1000 ping no less.
---
This was absolutely intended. There's no "oopsy I accidentally typed numerous lines of code that perfectly spaced and added perfectly sized rank emblems above the heads of survivors". They just regret it now and don't want to take responsibility.

I was thinking i could use fixated and some healing perk if i would be injured so i could heal but im not the biggest fan of self care since its really slow and i dont find that many totems with inner strenght but ill try it cheers
---
I guess you're right about that
---
I was there a bit ago and thought pretty much this. Unfortunately the Oni isn't really my thing so I'm back to an indefinite break.
---
To be fair, this is a good change for BT as well. Why should it be possible for Wraith, Pig, Freddy and Ghostface to be able to follow a survivor in BT until they bleed out? They can still use their abilities to prevent BT from triggering in the first place, and that interaction is less silly and at least has some measure of counterplay.
---
Things like Forever Freddy wouldn't need to exist if generator speed wasn't absurdly fast. Survivors already have incredibly strong map tiles that take very little thought to loop, and they're overly abundant. Coupled with generator speeds going lightning quick, even if Ruin *isn't* found in the first 30 seconds, you're basically playing from multiple steps behind as killer.
---
this would be great, would actually give us incentive to get to red ranks and verse sweaty ass spirits or tryhard 4-man swfs every match

I WASTED AN EBONY MORI, I DIDNT EVEN KILL ONE OF THEM!

THEY TEA-BAGGED AND MESSEGED ME CALLING ME TRASH, \[I CRIED IN REAL LIFE.\](/intensifies)
---
but how am i gonna survivor the killer now??? /s
---
I was thinking PT but im currently still just a rank 3 and i still get green and purple ranks and theyre below decent so i will try that when i get to rank 1/2, i will try inner strenght with it though. Cheers mate

Damn, you got it first. Glad I'm not the only one who finds that humor funny
---
I like it, but that would be way too busted. Both killers and survivors would be able to tailor loadouts specific to maps. The advantages would be far too great.
---
You think reddit cares?
---
Hol up. Demo doesent need to gather his power..like Oni does..
---
I got this game for free, was given David, feng, and bull free. Give doctor and gag free. Idk what you want from it
---
I recently switched to this my previous one was dead hard, inner strenght, detectivs hunch and BT and it worked the best out of all the builds i think i ever had, but since the dead hard kept on just screwing me over every single game i kinda got bored of that so i wanted to try something else, but they also said theyre looking into it so hopefully it will be fixed with the next chapter. But thanks ill consider it
---
Change the 4% to everybody else drinks. I feel that's more fair if you get that lucky!
---
Right, now that Deep Wound is never meant to actually make a survivor bleed out anymore to begin with, they might as well change what it does, getting rid of the bleed out mechanic and instead making Deep Wound afflict survivors with other detrimental effects, preferably even some that hinder their ability to lead a chase, such as by introducing some stamina mechanic where they can for example only fast-vault windows once every 30 seconds, or something of that sort.
---
Wait what. They are making it easier again. FFS. I don't want to have all these idiots back in rank 1.
---
Yeah, XP becomes shards when you level so it's the same thing, "bud". Also, you might want to brush up on your English, because "by level 100" isn't that elaborate a phrase.
---
But letting you have 75 hours (it's definitely more, and luck-based besides), 75 hours of time is still a large time investment. For something that affects gameplay. On a paid game. How long does it take to unlock a character in Overwatch? TF2?
---
Oh, and both sides aren't an advantage; specifically Survivor side is. The XP cuts off at 600 and Killers are in games until the end.

When I play with a friend it's normally drink when you do anything good. So skill checks, hook saves ect. If your killer it's every hit, hook, trap ect. And double for a kill.

I was really hoping for Starcourt Mall as a map tbh, mannequins in dark corners for jump scares, flickering neon lights, and broken windows everywhere. If you fix a gen near the little horse music plays faintly or something. I mean the lab is cool but the mall would have been better IMO

It does, in fact, and yes, I think I should own games I buy, not be obligated to keep paying like it's a subscription. By all means, they could make the game $40 or even $60, but they didn't.
---
Although I like how "specifically only that which affects gameplay" is automatically "everything." They can sell all the cosmetics they want, I won't complain.
---
You're so desperate to have the moral high ground because you'll shell out any amount to keep playing something you already bought, as though being exploited is a virtue. If you want disgust, try a mirror, because people like you are why companies like EA are notoriously, insultingly greedy.
---
And don't even try to pretend it's somehow necessary for them to sell gameplay content separately. Somehow, countless games survive by allowing all characters to be unlocked up-front, or purely through in-game currency. It's clearly doable.

&gt; Wow DBD Ghostface is lame :| I know they couldn‚Äôt use anything from the movies, but the whole build-up and motives are what made the unmasking of Ghostface in the movies so amazing. Killing for no reason would‚Äôve ruined Scream. 
---
Nah, DBD Ghostface is good as well. it just doesn't work in a movie like scream. Imagine him being unmasked and everybody going "Who the hell is this guy?". part of the magic of the movies like Scream is to see at the end somebody familiar being responsible for all the murderers and find their motives. on other hand on other slasher movies you know who the killer is from the begining and they are still good. DBD ghostface kinda enters in this type. It doesn't really matters who he is,all that matters is that he kills.
---
You know, it is actually funny, because the original idea in halloween was something like that. Michael wants to kill Laurie because he liked her as his victim. the idea was that it is scarier when it is something that could happen to anyone, that you don't need to be related to the killer, mess with the occult or enter a haunted house/camp everybody tells you not to, it just simply happens.
---
I use Xbox so I just clip it and save the clips to my phone via the app

normal exhaustion perks? there are 2 normal exhaust perks in the game by your standards.

Those being SB and Lithe. Everyother exhaust perk isnt just "Hold shift and run fast" so we should change them

IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT NEMESIS LEGION IS OP, APART FROM ONE BROKEN COMBO THE NERFED THE WEAKEST KILLER IN THE GAME, WTF

Okay killer

It either doesn't detect him unless he's 5 meters away or it detects him halfway across the map. Fix this bs

Does a 2nd frenzy hit cause the timer to reduce again?
---
You kind of camped them. This looks like green rank play.
---
On paper, this is a good idea. However, I feel like with rewards being offered, it would just make toxic players be more toxic. It sucks for the people who don‚Äôt play like that, but honestly, that appears to be a minority. I hate to say it, but this community for the most part doesn‚Äôt deserve rewards. I love the game, but it‚Äôs easily one of the worst communities I‚Äôve even seen, and the worst one I‚Äôve ever personally been a part off.
---
That is WAY TOO MUCH
---
Ehh... idk. The whole reasoning for putting Ghostface into DBD was because he was in the movies. If he wasn‚Äôt known for Scream, then yeah Ghost is an ok killer, but because he was put into the games for the movies I would say his story is pretty lame. It‚Äôs obvious they couldn‚Äôt make his back story close to the movies so they had to make something up. 
---
And yeah I‚Äôve heard about the whole Laurie thing before lol.
---
Oh? You‚Äôre approaching me?
---
He is balanced people dont know how to counter him
---
killers who use ruin cant apply pressure so they resort to handicapped "meta" perks just like survivors that can't live without exhaustion perks
---
Self care usually isn‚Äôt worth it. Inner strength is pretty good, so long as you just cleanse a totem when you see it instead of hunting it down.
---
Valve has basically stopped playing the game developer role and they're letting epic steal all the exclusives
---
Maybe for you, but I‚Äôve talked about this with other people and you can only buy them with shards or auric cells. I‚Äôm the only person I know that can only buy her with Auric Cells. You must have a special edition or something.

This would make me want to actually try to rank up tbh. Wish they‚Äôd add something like this. Also how come no leaderboards? Imagine how cool that‚Äôd be. Showing how many gens you‚Äôve finished how long you‚Äôve been chased how many pallet stuns you‚Äôve hit etc. i just wish there was more to dbd

"You earn an average of ~0.072 Iridescent Shards per Experience Point."
---
9000/.072 = 125000 XP necessary, although it'll be a little more to hit the actual level, most likely.
---
You can make up to 600 XP per match, in 10 minutes. Any time you spend over that is wasted. 125000/600 = 208.33 optimal matches, ignoring queue time or time spent over the XP theshold.
---
Sure, you can get 600 more a day on top of that, so we can call it 200, average 15 minutes, 200*15 = 3000, 3000/60 = 50 hours of JUST gameplay to grind out roughly 9k shards. This becomes 67 hours when we add a 5 minute average queue time, though.

I got pc and console so im chillin

"Don't use the PTB to assess balance like it's intended, let anything and everything that's too good or bad through because I want to abuse it."

---
Wtf are u talking about
---
Bruh I said Spirit needed a beads nerf and vault anim but go off I guess.
---
now that is asking for alcohol poisoning
---
Right now Spirit and Billy are probably the most commonly seen in red ranks in my experience (PS4). Spirit may simmer down with her upcoming nerf though.
---
I mean i still could sacirfice BT for detectives to find totems easier but i like bt since it just gives you so much points

Sorry but ballerina feng is still superior

Hahah you‚Äôre right you‚Äôre right!!
---
Haha I've never had it yet. Were normally drunk by then so just have 3-4 games each. We do it with whiskey and know we're our limits are.
---
Ehh, it's medium-cheap, but it's definitely worth waiting for sales if you plan to buy DLC, and not everyone is worth owning so shards are okay, if slow. It's the hard paywall stuff that's kind of gross.
---
"I got flashlight stunned once, pallet stunned twice and I missed an attack due to dead hard. TOXIC SURVIVOR"
---
"What do you mean toxic? All I did was facecamp you and even though you got the lucky 4% I didnt respect that. And, I slugged because I'm so terrible at endgame. But me? Toxic? I'm just playing the game. Geez, all survivors do is complain."
---
Pallets arent wasted if they are used correctly
---
Well in that context it sounds more fair.
---
Just because you aren't getting chased when Adrenaline pops, doesn't mean it's a wasted slot. It picks you up if you got slugged, heals you if you gen rushed instead of healing yourself first, gives you an extra health state and speed boost off hook, etc. The perk is just insanely strong.
---
PC doesn't get Doctor or Hag DLC free.
---
Looks better than the trailer, because it actually looks like Yui, great drawing!
---
S W E A T Y
---
&gt;Also people need to point out, not every legion will be like this. There may be people who don't spend money for the new killer and don't get the perk, or just don't run Nemesis. Unlike old Legion, every player that played him had that broken power. This will be situational, and you'll have you figure out the legions play style at the beginning to determine how careful you need to play against him. Also, everyone is saying just drop the pallets early. I also agree with that. I don't know, I just think its frustrating they nerfed him again, and people are salty over these perk combos that came with his nerf.
---
The only point that needs to be made is from survivors POV. 
---
Seeing your Deep Wound bleedout decreasing with absolutely nothing you can do to prevent it is one of the most frustrating thing there is on DBD. Add that to the fact that some players enjoy playing killer like a complete cunt and you give survivors an absolute garbage of experience. 
---
From the killer's POV, following someone until that person eventually goes down is not a power.
---
Runner would just be poised but better tho
---
he is balanced, but when he finds you with his power, your options are Die, or Die in a locker
---
WHISKEY?!?? JJEEEEZZZZ
---
I really want F13 to resurrect. Its only crime was not letting you pick Jason.
---
**And I ain't talkin' bout a science Pig**

**Amanda just be sluggin', and getting me pissed...**
---
Well you can give hemorrhage to healthy survivors but putting mangled on healthy survivors makes no sense
---
It's like the one bad thing about him. He encoruages slugging to maximize use of his power.
---
Said streamer is the biggest crybaby of all the streamers.
---
Haha yeah. What do you drink?
---
Freddy, Spirit, Myers and Billy on Xbox
---
Yeah everybody wants to win that‚Äôs how game‚Äôs usually go. Just some people don‚Äôt want/need to be handed a win
---
Yeah this glitch is getting beyond annoying had it happen 4 times within 8 games or so it's even more annoying when the person who's benefiting fromnthe glitch won't leave you alone.
---
Yeah, Chucky would take effort. He'd need a new base model and anims.
---
 This shit will have no counter play  just like old legion. They cant let it go live
---
The fact some players will not abuse this exploit is not a reason to keep it lol.
---
i think i‚Äôd probably be so confused. wouldn‚Äôt be able to do gens but i‚Äôd heal others and be extra careful with hook saves.. immersed lol
---
It could be her mint rags add-on, which lets her teleport to any trap. Otherwise, maybe you uncrouched at just the right amount of distance for it to trigger.
---
Flashlights are definitely supposed to burn them away.
---
Susie and Joey each have Christmas sweaters incoming, so you have that to look forward to.

A bit of a tangent, but I love scratch mirror Myers. I just got to level him up over the weekend and got 2 mirrors. 1st match on McMillan estate. Goddamn it was fun. Hiding behind a wall, waiting for a survivor to pass by. Ummmph. Easy STBFL stack. Though my killer is just at r15

---
Honestly felt that üòÇ, I would just crouch next to Claudette in a bush and wait to see the killer go around the entire map 5 times looking for ya before I decide to move.
---
They find it hilarious but they always fail to see that they are ruining gameplay for others.
---
Wowü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Everyone wants it, devs said no, here's hoping another asym slasher game comes along and has more ambition.
---
Identity V does have one, but it's a mess because Survivors also have a "gen"speed nerf of 50%, making it more like 4v8.
---
I‚Äôm talking about the ‚Äúfirst match as X role‚Äù bonus when I say taking into account playing both sides. Shards from levelling is a completely different system from the old one as it means it‚Äôs gathered at a much different rate. You‚Äôre really taking my semantics seriously? That was intentionally hyperbolic to show how ridiculous you sounded. Though I suppose I can‚Äôt expext you to understand that, you‚Äôve never come off as the sharpest tool in the shed, now have you Dante. You also don‚Äôt seem to realize that dlc being paid for is the only reason they can continue making dlc. If they were to continue charging 20$ for the game they wouldn‚Äôt make enough every 3 months to justify the next chapter. And if you bump the price up to that of a AAA title you‚Äôre still losing more money than you would if you just buy the dlc on sale. Also, it takes (supposedly) 145 hours to get devotion 1 (which isn‚Äôt true, it‚Äôs less) and at devotion 1 you have enough shards to buy 2 characters and have 6,300 shards left over. So that‚Äôs really a character every 70 hours (roughly, its more like 72 if you care that much) if we use exaggerated timeframes. Based on an actual timeframe (and my personal experience, being a devotion 5 player) it‚Äôs more like 110 hours of game time to get a devotion level, which would make it be a character every 40 hours or so.
---
Are you sure?
---
beers or alcohol if anyone‚Äôs choice tbh!
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Otz has confirmed Save the Best For Last is an amazing perk. It's the perk of a pay-only Killer.
---
Do you think that's air you're breathing?
---
Sounds good. I used to drink beer but since I got older I started preferring whiskey. (I'm 31)
---
Yeah. It shines most when you're getting chased. You won't be slugged 95% of the time. And healing after the Gens are done isnt really taking too long either. It shouldn't heal you getting of the hook imo.
---
The perk is not for me. I never get to use it. I like perks that I can use close to 100% of the time.
---
I also play lots of legion and other m1 killers. TBH I play Legion the way people don't like, trying to slow the game as much as possible, and then use their map knowledge and mobility to snowball when everyone's injured. Those strengths don't get respected well enough, it's really where Legion's true power lies. To take the best advantage of it though, you have to play in sort of a typically skummy way. Hook defense for instance is one of their best strengths because they can zone multiple people away from large areas of the map and find people trying to go for saves. It's not something to do for every hook, but when the right opportunity comes it will secure the game.
---
Cheers!
---
Otz has it on his YT to check out. :)
---
But some Killers being cash-exclusive is P2W, so long as they or their perks (like BBQ) are good.
---

that‚Äôs how you make people SHIT THEIR PANTS
---
I found the answer to my question, solidly, once and for all, in the in-game news for the release of the Archives. It's easy to miss, but right after the tentative release schedule, there's more information:
---
&gt; *Please note these release dates are subject to change. All previously unlocked levels will remain available once released, but will stop providing progression towards the Rift once the relevant Rift has expired.*
---
So that's it sorted: You keep the levels of your Tomes forever. The wording here also implies that players who begin playing *after* the relevant Rift has closed will *still* be able to access previously released Tomes, but I wouldn't tempt fate by dallying on them until we've seen a Rift close to confirm.
---
i‚Äôm only 22 but too much beer makes my stomach hurt &gt;.&lt;
---
You blind asshole, I didn't make the 145 estimation.
---
But okay, if you insist, we'll make it 10 minutes. That's 83 hours, rounded down.
---
throws the first pallet without even looking at the killer this guys pretty bad but than again he runs deadhard and most deadhard gamers are bad
---
I had that happen one time too. the whole team bitched at me saying it was boring and then I replied "then DC" and someone was like "Nah ez points" and I fucking "then why are you complaining" like how can you be mad at chest defender Bubba man
---
Makes sense, thanks!!!
---
Not just today dude, I tagged you on res a few months ago because I got sick of wasting my time on your comments. I haven‚Äôt paid attention to much you‚Äôve been saying recently, but everything I can remember you saying has been wrong, whining or stupid
---
WHY USE SPIRIT FURY WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS?!
---
Bt is better, totems are usually pretty easy to find
---
Remember when people thought Demo was too strong? Yeah. That was a mistake.
---
Why not just a charm each season?
---
They shouldn‚Äôt nerf an already low tier killer because of a perk that you have to pay for or wait to be in the shrine, I don‚Äôt think this will last long.
---
If Hyde ever became a killer that'd make for some interesting discussions. The literal manifestation of all evil in the human soul, or a human defined as literally pure evil, which is more evil?
---
oh my god
---
Is this some shitty copypasta?
---
The core problem with this game is unwritten rules clashing with the devs intentions. Camping and tunneling is scummy because it removes the players ability to play and it prevents killers from learning how to improve. But there's no punishment to these things so the most killers have to listen to is survivors being reasonably upset about it.
---
Im trying to hook the survivors to please the entity but im dummy thicc and the clap from my cheeks keep alerting them
---
Please someone make Hotline Miami style perks
---
Good, I can track you down easier.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA SO FUNNY HERES PLATINUM"

r/coaxedintoasnafu  
---
All seriousness, love the post op.
---
Yes
---
That's the main feature of his power, imo
---
Spirit, spirit, and spirit
---
Almost guaranteed, it won't make it off the PTB.
---
Legion needed to be changed from what he was because just uncounterably downing someone by cheesing the deep wound status was fucking terrible for the game. The spot they're in is not good, but that's because Legion's power is just fundamentally awful balance-wise, they're either overpowered or garbage.
---
This doesn't "fix" Legion, it just breaks them the other way again. Legion needs a new power from the ground up.
---
It's early to say, but currently the Oni is much better than Billy, but that's why there's a PTB. Oni has complete control of his instadown and mobility, there's no learning curve. Billy on the other hand has very poor maneuverability that requires a learning curve and an instadown that's risk/reward. 
---
Billy plays as a risk/reward killer. Oni plays as a reward-exclusive killer.
---
How long until they run out of good charm ideas then? I mean, yeah it would sorta help for a few months but eventually the community would either stop caring or the creation process would slow down.
---
PC, probably the killer just left the lobby and it somehow put me in it, i can't say how to reproduce since i was just searching for a match, i wish the other player wouldn't have left so we could be 5v1 just to see it haha
---
I gave him poor mans' gold for both of us.
---
Legion was nerfed for the moonwalking exploit and now that it is here again everyone wants it. Wtf with this mind change.
---
I mean he's barely any different to Pig and Plague in that sense.
---
Na
---
u lucky
---
&gt; it‚Äôs that they want to do it right

Is it though? I played this game for about 50 hours around the time leatherface was released, and now around the same amount since halloween, and I feel like very little has changed. Perk system is still the same, grind is the same, there are still the same complaints about balance and ranks. All devs have implemented are more dlc, microtransactions, and the rift, no actual changes to things like this. Seems to me bhvr don't actually care that much about improving the game, but would rather just constantly release things that make them money directly. And I don't mean that to be a dig at bhvr, the game isn't in a horrible state so they can get away with doing it, but I don't think that "they want to do it right" is the reason they haven't implemented this, it's probably just because it doesn't make them money.

Maybe mark it as spoiler

No this David is using speedhacks
---
Yup ill give it a go, thanks mate
---
In short I would ignore the objective my team is working on. If slather up some corpse paint and find the right Jeff. Once I found him I would ask him to join me. 
---
From then on I would go to legion and convince one of the members to join me. So that‚Äôs 3 members. 
---
Then I would go up to the doctor for his natural ability of electricity of the love of electricity and has him to join me. 
---
Lastly I would go up to Ghostface and ask if he would join me. 
---
So now I have 5 people and you are curious on what the fuck am I rambling on about. 
---
Well I would have a killer contact the entity in somehow or some way to approve of my idea. 
---
Once we get a yes I would make a Blackened Death Metal band with all these members and write songs together. We will perform every Saturday night. 
---
Doctor is Lead Guitarist (lover of electricity and self centered, perfect for lead) 
---
Black Metal Jeff will be Rhythm guitarists and Art designer. 
---
Frank (I would assume him out of everyone) would be on drums due to his stamina and love of stabbing multiple times. 
---
Ghostface would be the bass player because he just seems like a bass player.
---
Lastly I will be the Vocalist. 
---
And together we will be called Eternal Damnation and play music for everyone.
---
well stop looking at me you urchin
---
Her second perk is god tier what are you on about
---
That is way to many bloodpoints.
---
I think after they made it so you could buy killers and survivors with shards they stopped doing free dlc.
---
The lagg has been ridiculous.
---
Legion was nerfed for the moonwalking exploit and players wants it again. I just can't stand it
---
Yes but nemesis could be incredibly useful with dark devotion.
---
Every time you hit your obsession,they get your terror radius.
---
This means that if you ‚Äúrespect pallets‚Äù you can easily tap the survivor and confuse the crap out of everyone every time.
---
With a stealth killer or Demogorgon or even Leatherface it would be absolutely amazing.
---
I befriended a billy and he let me get the gens done while he killed the rest of my teammates one by one
---
It's not 1 sided, both get plenty of hate.
---
Lol who on earth said demo was too strong on ptb?
---
They both get a lot of hate but survivor is facing 1 killer. 
---
Killer is facing 4 survivors which means they have a high chance of having at least 1 rude survivor or 4.
---
The idea of the ptb is to teat these things out. Devs do read reddit. Its beat for people to voice their opinions now.
---
Its not funny though?
---
Just press M2 after hitting someone and feral frenzy shuts off and keeps the progress
---
I have... That feng perk.. It activated... I can.. SPEED BURST AWAY BOY!!!
---
Mate just mute the chat, don‚Äôt worry about what people say. You can type a gg and then mute the chat.
---
you just posted another video of something else like this. sorry dude, but it‚Äôs probably your internet.
---
It wouldn't have to be monthly though. It could be a set shop, same cosmetics forever, with new one's being added in every so often to keep it fresh.
---
That way you could work towards really cool outfits to show off your dedication to the game/ranks.
---
Ever since they added the outrun evil achievement as long as they weren't rude I'll down survivors and hatch drop then so they can get it to.
---
Survivors got all gens except 3 that were all cluttered. I literally had no idea what to do besides patrolling the gens and hoping to get a survivor here and there. Finally, I got them all and was going to show mercy to the last one by bringing them to hatch but couldn't find him.
---
On the exit lobby I was welcomed with those messages.
---
Im so glad I‚Äôm not the only person who has ever referred to it as a blimp
---
Literally moonwalking legion that doesn't require moonwalking. How is that not busted as fuck?
---
It won't make it off PTB without a change.
---
DORARARARARARARARARA!!!
---
But...... what surv rank are you because at rank 1-2 every spirit is pretty decent
---
haha playing on console can't wait to stomp them with crossplay
---
The main issue is that every change they attempt to mitigate these issues are met with an equal blowback from other players. Plus this company went from 30 people to almost 300 people in those 2 years, this is all new to them. They‚Äôre kind of in a stage where all they can do is try not to break anything too badly while they figure out the ins and outs of being 10x the size they used to be. Soon you‚Äôll see them improve by leaps and bounds. Hell, you can already see a difference in the way everything is handled. They gotta get the foundations laid out properly first
---
Might be because I play more Survivor, but damn does it feel pretty one sided sometimes.
---
I just try to enjoy the game how it is rn just imagine having no bugs or anything to complain about at all. where would the fun be
---
Behavior gets so many reports like this it would take weeks just to get to yours. It sucks I know from experience but just mute chat and save yourself the headache.
---
she‚Äôs arguably the most powerful killer in the game, definitely the most powerful killer on console (since nurse‚Äôs power is much weaker on console compared to PC). Even with incoming nerfs, people still aren‚Äôt anticipating her power to lessen too much; she‚Äôll likely still be a beast to run in high ranks.
---
As survivor it gets easier the higher rank you are. Swf rush ranks just to get high and stomp killers. In high ranks as a killer its way harder to pip since you have to use cheeky tactics
---
i'd probably be the fastest journey from "new survivor" to "tossed into the void like a used tissue" that anyone has ever seen
---
Is it not a variant of her Summer outfit?
---
If so, we may be seeing the next lot of Rift outfits.
---
This is perfect üëå
---
And the grind in DBD is becoming too much. Why is this a bad thing?
---
Freddy got reworked a while back; he used to be bad, and you still see some content referring to him as such. He‚Äôs pretty strong now.
---
Every time I see someone who just sits in lockers all game or camps hatch I do this. I'll purposely run by them and get them killed as I'm damn good at looping and usually the camper isnt. It's my favorite when they hide in lockers. I run near them and spam open it so you get the "huh" animation as you close it and dont enter. 9 out of 10 times the killer will grab them from the locker and ylu can get away. Its hysterical. Easily one of my favorite things to do in this game.
---
Right? Dang still really cool though, I‚Äôm surprised the Denver is in the back and not inside one of the 4 main player spots, I wonder if they have extra spots for something later on. :)
---
This reminds me of darkness from konosuba
---
True, and I get that, but I mean... that's just how things go in an asymmetrical game? Killers are always going to face more survivors in one day then a survivor will face killer, so of course they're going to have a higher chance of facing toxicity but... that's mostly the Dev's not really doing much to encourage good behaviour too imho.
---
If the devs saw this they‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúWe gave you the tome and rift challenges that are impossible to complete and you want more? Get outta here‚Äù
---
I'd say should be reworked somehow. Maybe so it refreshes a bit less often or something like that
---
Well, we‚Äôve had the shop for over a year now and they‚Äôre still pumping ideas, in the mean time I think it could possibly work, by the time that they‚Äôve run out of ideas hopefully they can think up of different rewards, I mean charms were very recently added, so hopefully they‚Äôll be able to think up a new concept and use that for the next few months of rank rewards, I‚Äôm not entirely sure as it was just a suggestion. But having charms would be better than no charms imo.
---
man clowns are nasty,and not in the good kinda way
---
Just lay on the ground and sleep lol.
---
Nevermind, I‚Äôm an asshole. I‚Äôve got you mixed up with another Dante. I‚Äôm sorry about that, I saw the first part of your username and just let my brain auto fill the rest. I‚Äôll of course delete the comment calling you a whiny bitch
---
Do you not have EYES, bro?
---
Nah, you‚Äôll have to beat me to it lol.
---
How this happened is that in PTB, if you frenzy vault at a area with a high drop, the legion for some reason will get stuck in the falling animation. This resets if you hit someone or get stunned by a pallet.
---
People who think that old legion is back and this will be op combo are probably ranks 20 xD
---
That's how Terror Radius works basically
---
&lt;
---
typo XD
---
And when he mori's someone, he'll rip out the persons guts, kinda like Mrs. Hag, and then scream "IT'S FUCKING RAW"
---
Maybe, but I‚Äôm still not convinced cosmetics are the way to go with this. Maybe I‚Äôm weird, but cosmetics wouldn‚Äôt motivate me much
---
I dont know what i'm looking at but i laughed and saved it so thanks
---
Only if you have Frank's Mixtape
---
Figured, just wanted to poke some fun :)
---
By itself, you can use Nemesis to get sneaky hits on your obsession after pretending to back off, which is similar to how you use DD.
---
When combined, you basically have constant access to a DD target, which is potentially great. The generated TR from DD doesn't seem to be hidden by Nemesis, though.
---
700k for only rank 6 is fucking nuts
---
I mean, nothing's stopping the killer from shit talking back though. In my experience, survivors usually shit talk each other more then the killer. (Unless the killer was being a complete dick.) Nothing's stopping them from snapping back at survivors. It's not like they know when Survivors leave in post game or anything. They also have Moris, which have helped me with Survivor frustration in the past. See the same survivor being a dick to you? Mori them. Not your problem any more if they're not in the game.
---
Just give us both, I need bloodpoints more than Shards
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying. The reward I need is just people of similar skill at the same rank as me so that I get decent queue times. I let myself hang around rank 6 because if I go much higher it‚Äôs tough to find a match. So anything that makes more people climb the ranks is good enough for me because I‚Äôll benefit indirectly from it
---
This
---
Also give Legion a decent buff or rework this time
---
Holy shit never seen any post about this yet, this is nuts. Gonna give these a long hard read
---
Literally my thoughts exactly.
---
For me it's the opposite on PS4. Killer matchmaking is instant and you wait eternity and beyond to play a survivor. It was especially bad when I tried swf
---
They nerfed it because it's the only exhaustion perk that has an active component when exhausted. These perks should be risk/reward and they should teach you to manage your timer, not be active all the time.
---
I agree with you BUT fixing the maps would take considerably more time and effort. So just nerfing the perk is a good quick fix for now (But there are still a few maps that have infinites that don't require balanced). So I'm hoping that once they fix the maps, they'll revert balanced back to normal.
---
You haven't played enough survivor if that's all you think they can do lol. 
---
Bringing you to the hatch to close it in your face, mori spamming, leaving you slugged to rev their chainsaw/ puke on you/ whatever else, and body blocking you in corners are a few I can think of off the top of my head.
---
I'm not saying killers are more toxic, but there's way more they can do to BM in game besides face camping and nodding.
---
It made too many structures that level of annoying though. Some loops still need fixing but BL made a lot of structures even worse.
---
Shhh don't bother him with logic.
---
he's not OP. he literally becomes so slow after doing anything. just learn to not stick around the same loop constantly
---
Do you know what the point of a **Public Test Build** is?
---
It's not there for you to "have fun" with something, it's there so you can **test** it and give feedback before it goes live.
---
how is Oni "OP"
---
[Tome I - Level II - 215K Unclaimed](https://i.imgur.com/4YR1sGU.jpg)
---
I feel 50k per rank is a bit too much, Good idea tho.
---
Honestly, this is the best Legion rework i have seen to date. One minor issue is the locker stuff which will make it possible to cross-map camp. However, I'd much rather play as this Legion than the one in DBD at this time. This also makes use of the fact that the Legion is four characters instead of appearing one at a time. Really good concept!
---
You did right, up until you actually engaged these kids. What happened is they misplayed; it‚Äôs a survivor‚Äôs responsibility to avoid 3genning themselves, which is why there‚Äôs a perk designed to prevent it (hello, *Deja Vu*). 
---
The problem is, in DBD there are certain mechanics (namely the Doctor‚Äôs shock therapy) that would allow a killer to literally prevent the game from progressing in a very specific situation. What can happen is a Doc can go in with certain addons and deliberately defend a 3gen on the map, letting survivors do all the other ones, and then using shock therapy/madness radius to literally prevent them from being able to even work on the generators. This is considered *holding the game hostage* because there is literally no way for anyone but the doctor to progress the game as long as the doctor doesn‚Äôt move. 
---
The problem is, some players see ‚Äúholding the game hostage‚Äù as being a reportable offense and, without reading up on it, take that to mean ‚Äúa killer doing literally anything to mildly inconvenience their quest to do whatever the hell they want,‚Äù up to and including *playing the objective* (i.e. patrolling generators). 
---
These guys played themselves and tried to take it out on you to protect their egos. That‚Äôs usually what toxicity is, anyway, and spotting that is the best way to brush it off.
---
1. It's almost 2020, Hippy isn't an insult anymore and it makes you sound like your 60. 
---
2. That shit isn't funny in the slightest, you'd have to be 12 to think that's legitimately funny.
---
Legion didn't get decimated because he was good, he was never good. He was just boring and had no counter play. It's not fun to get stabbed once by a nearly unavoidable attack then just run around for 30 seconds hopelessly with literally nothing you can do because you're going to go down. Not to mention nemesis also exists which gives you 1 minute oblivious (which will also cause DW to go down) just for stunning or flash lighting the killer.
---
why do you want to wait?
---
Lets hope it'll be a green so it could be bought with shards
---
its still in ptb, assume it will be changed
---
Ngl I am happy that killers are being buffed.
---
Gotcha
---
Is it just me or does she look a bit like Greta Thunberg
---
1. notice how it says shitpost at the top bro
---
kinda means it‚Äôs dumb and only funny if you‚Äôre in a good mood unlike yourself
---
2. calling me 60 then calling me 12 wow what an insult i‚Äôm hurt buddy
---
BL
---
But that's getting nerfed too, so now i guess it's about to be DH again. 
---
Some people are saying SB is making a come back. But it's not for me.
---
O.O
---
What did you need to know my perks for? If you don‚Äôt mind me asking.
---
But better you can just follow them with no downside but the survour is the one who has to prok it
---
They will still probably reuse a voice like they did with Adam.
---
I never said it was super common, i was just pointing out that killers can do a lot more than face camp or nod to be toxic.
---
**THIS BUT THEY'RE RED RANKS!!**
---
LIKE, DID YOU SERIOUSLY GET TO RANK 4 WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO DO GENS THROUGH RUIN!? UNLESS YOU'RE A SMALL GAME GAMER, SCREW THE TOTEM AND DO THE FREAKING GEN!!
---
Back in the day, when spirit released she had Nurse‚Äôs sound pack during the PTB, she got her own voice with the live server release. Most likely Yui‚Äôs voice is not ready right now, but she will have her own voice in the live server.
---
I'm hesitant to suggest it due to the issues most have with SWF - especially since they allegedly plan to add an in-game mic system at some point - but maybe add in a 'callout' system for survivors? Make it so that if they're within x meters if the killer and can see the killer, they can tag the killer and have their aura revealed for a second or two. They can only call out a killer every now and again. A debuff would show on the killer, letting them know they've been spotted - and that there's a survivor hiding nearby - and the debuff would temporarily cancel the power of Ghostface.
---
Survivors constantly whine about facing strong killers whilst using the same 6 strong perks and items every single game.
---
You weren't though. You were running an off-meta build vs the super  meta spirit.
---
A shitpost implies that there's some form of comedy, of which this has none.
---
Charms are pretty useless and even if some wanted to collect these for collection sake after the first time then what new rank charms every month?
---
Charms are noticable and look cool on the hook, however on survivor I haven't noticed others charms really and If I do I can't always tell what it is.
---
Charms feel more like useless filler for the tift pass and tome rewards then anything of value or worth showing off.
---
At season reset I'd like to see rewards based of rank maybe some BP or a few shards.
---
Not sure i understand but i guess thank you ? &lt;3
---
thank you !
---
He‚Äôs on them PEDs. Should be getting a drug test from the Entity soon!
---
Getting looped around a single building on coal tower, haddonfield, ormond, mother‚Äôs dwelling, disturbed ward, the harvesters on coldwind maps, or making the ironworks window even stronger isn‚Äôt much fun for any killer that can‚Äôt shut down those loops, and a map offering can pretty easily remove the situational aspect of it. BL is my most used exhaustion perk and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs being changed, even if survivors won‚Äôt be able to loop certain structures to the extent they can now. 
---
Besides that, does anyone somehow expect the devs to constantly have BL in their minds when making a map?? It‚Äôs easier to adjust the cause than it is to rebuild and rework every structure to counter it.
---
sorry lord of comedy, i guess i should just post something you‚Äôll find funny
---
hmm let‚Äôs see.. fortnite bad minecraft good 
---
keanu reeves wholesome 
---
ok boomer
---
funny enough for you kid?
---
Gorgeous !
---
If that would be added, people would sweat their asses off and would tryhard all the time, the game would lost its fun
---
PC players enjoying the PTB - Me with my potato connection that need 4h to download the PTB.
---
No, it's not.
---
Tapps not doing so good
---
Blame the constant nerfs. Legion is so bad now that people just want him to have *something* he can use to kill people, even if it is completely unfair and unfun to play against. As it is now, he may as well not even have a power.
---
For some reason it only works when you change obsession using the methods listed  by nemesis which doesn't include unhooking so Furtive Chase doesn't work.
---
Most of the people on a DBD subreddit will probably say yes. Just be aware that there are some toxic assholes and if you‚Äôre sensitive to that sort of thing it‚Äôs probably not for you. Regardless, don‚Äôt let a few bad apples ruin your enjoyment of what is likely one of the best horror games in the last three years.
---
Oni-zoomys
---
Nope. It's not just a swf thing. I've had red ranks, high purple, and yellow above 15 in the same lobby that weren't swf after the update. I shouldn't be getting red ranks when I'm staying at 12, even if they are swf. It doesn't widen the parameters that far. At MOST I should get a rank 6, not people above.
---
&gt; If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
Notice it says hard limit? That means it shouldn't be matchmaking with those players. Yet, it still does often enough for it to be a problem. That's because it's broken, like I said. 
---
&gt;Do you even understand how it works?
---
Yeah, I do. You don't, though. That much is obvious. 
---
&gt; It searches based on ping and rank, so if there‚Äôs not enough people online with semi decent ping relative to you that are your rank then it has to broaden the search.
---
I'll just leave this here.
---
&gt;You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players.  
---
Ping has nothing to do with matchmaking while on dedicated servers. You connect to the closest server, and matchmake with the players on there by rank. Guess what? We're on dedicated servers on PC. 
---
I'm not a game developer, so I wouldn't know how to fix it. That's beyond the point, though. It's not my job to fix it, or create a matchmaking system that won't break. That's BHVR's. I don't need to know how to fix it in order to point out that it's broken.
---
You sound like a condescending asshole. How about you read up on the matchmaking system before you start sprouting off bullshit, yeah? Tell you what, since I'm feeling nice, I'll even link you the update where they go over this. [Here you go. Educate yourself.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)

oH HeLl yEAh

I remember back when Ace had built in iron will lol
---
Old legion's back bb, you know, after blood lust which is still sorta unreliable mostly
---
well looks like you won kid your medals in the mail
---
(still no ideas tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
---
that's only in the PTB though, pretty sure they won't have two characters with the same voice actor :D
---
That's weird though, because nemesis says WHENEVER the obsession changes.
---
I'll be looking for it.
---
(Still repeating the same sentence)
---
It is really map-dependant, on some maps it is insane on some it is worse. A lot of perks are like that. Difference between BL and Sprint Burst is that BL can easily be activated whenever you want and SB requires better timer management. Sure, it makes BL worse but honestly on maps with little height it was bad to begin with, that won¬¥t change. 
---
I guess they wanted more consistency with exhaustion perks, and that is fine. Just because there are bigger issues doesn¬¥t mean they all get priority. Reworking an entire map is much harder and time consuming than changing a perk.
---
&gt;That's weird though, because nemesis says WHENEVER the obsession changes.
---
‚Äæ\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/‚Äæ
---
Does it change something? Barely.
---
they don't balance the maps anyway lol. how long has the Ironworks loop been there? what about the unwinnable coldwind window? they're just nerfing the perk to enable them to be as lazy as possible. and you're defending their laziness lmao actually pathetic.
---
Honestly just ignore them, people can whine when they lose, no matter how fair you are
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
I don't know if you remember but before they changed legion the second someone saw a legion they DC'd.
---
Every.
---
Single.
---
Time.
---
So I would be an angry killer too because that is what will happen if they don't change mend or the perk.

The solo survivor experience is just getting worse as time goes by...
---
You're a dumbass if you buy everything at full price, no offense.
---
If you go to any third party website like instant gaming or eneba, you can get everything for like 1/3 of the price, the game is like $7, dlcs are $3 each, in total you'd get everything for $50-60 which is the regular price for a game.
---
Also you don't need to buy everything, I've had this game since it came out and I have only bought Hag for ruin, and Freddy because I find him fun to play, I got every other strong perk like bbq or pgtw from the weekly shop, and I was a Billy main before I got freddy.
---
except they aren't on every single map. the only ones that really stick out are Haddonfield and maybe grim pantry, though I'd argue grim pantry can be broken even without balanced landing.
---
Yeah I get that. And I also get that there a lot of.map specific infinites that need addressing too. I just think nerfing this perk is the classic band aid that BHVR likes to apply to bigger issues. All my opinion mind. I'm probably missing something huge that makes this nerf legit.
---
Closing the game and powering down the console for a bit then back on fixed it for me.
---
I've just started to get good on his lunges consistently at loops

We out here
---
[He got stuck in another room like this without a pallet. ](https://streamable.com/u0wtp)
---
This is exactly what we need, I feel there is honestly little to no reason to go for higher ranks than to experience sweaty try hards
---
Well that's another instance of this happening. I guess Haddonfield is just super bugged now haha
---
Not that hard imo. Just do a normal chase, if you see you are close to a dropped pallet or window vault and you are garunteed to get a hit. Just wait till you are closer and grab them when they go over it.
---
I hate this meme format so much. It was supposed to show a Count vs Count table and now it's just a Lisa Simpson or a Spiderman Professor ripoff.

Well Stranger Things DLC chars is still not available to buy using Shards... How long does it usually take before it becomes purchasable via shards?
---
I think he didn't drug it, but pissed in it the fat fuck
---
My man on that straight grind. Best of luck to you my guy.
---
I don't think they'd ever do Auric Cells since they're a premium currency, but I like the idea of iridescent shards, shit's hard to farm exactly because you can't
---
Although it usually falls a week or two after the PC date?
---
The difference is, the Stranger Things DLC is a licenced chapter. You can't ever buy those with shards.
---
They're not. They're making it so that you don't go all the way down to green ranks when it's reset. Red ranks will go purple.
---
Step 1 press m2 or R2 or rb
---
Step 2 find a corner
---
Step 3 ???
---
Step 4 profit.
---
SHHHHH
---
Its an awesome design !

So this guy collects blood and see it many times clear than other killers. Does it mean he is impossible to shake off once you are imjured ?

Carrylizard was nowhere to be found since the revelation of the new killer. First indications suggest they might have took off.
---
Thats because while she is one of the best, people are too lazy to take the time to learn her. Her high points are really high but her low points are very low if you get caught in a bad situation.
---
Spirit and nurse. Spirit easy to learn but can take a few games before u understand her. Nurse hard to learn even harder to master but once you do you will become an unstopable force that will get to rank 1 in no time, hell u dont even need any fancy addons or Good meta perks to 4k with them they are already strong enough

Does Sloppy still work on Frenzy hits?
---
Not if they run beast of prey too. At which point they have undetectable after they get bloodlust. Then if they lose bloodlust by getting pallet stunned, congratulations, nemesis just triggered!
---
Thoughts on new killer aside, are you ready yo suck a dick OP?
---
I can't even stalk them out in the open
---
insidious, iron grasp agitation trapper? hmm I smell cap
---
I just read the perk to make sure and when it says "Any time a new Survivor becomes the Obsession" it is within the context of the perk so if the obsession changes by stun, then the oblivious effect activates
---
Walk up to a survivor doing a gen and whack the gen, some realize u need to farm and let u get the grab. Got it instantly
---
Preference?
---
Also if you're running a Haddonfield offering.
---
Legitimately. Had a game against a Plague today where I used dead hard, got the exhaustion, but still got hit. Maybe I just have real shit timing idk
---
amao
---
And add-ons?
---
Survivors DC more recently in my experience, last night i played only bubba without addons and stuff like insidious or noed, and people still ragequit or suicide on hook.
---
Could not get one normal game in purple ranks in.
---
I have a way different experience. If I'm trying to multitask, I queue survivor because it takes a few minutes. If I want to play I have to do killer for games quickly.
---
Mangled doesn't make you leave more blood trails. It makes you heal slower
---
Legion will need an entire rework, the base kit is almost impossible to balance.
---
Everyone is stuck inside a bubble of legion, spirit and plague...yet not a single person says anything about the brutality of The Oni. Its a new killer that looks amazing, and BHVR did a great job. And yet, here is the subreddit, busy complaining again.
---
&gt;PTBs should finally just give you a billion bp so you can test every new thing
---
They are always able to give us Auric Cells to test things when needed  (happened when the Shop went live and battle pass), doesn't seem that hard to do the same with bloodpoints.
---
PTB is for testing and balance suggestions, not for entertainment, that‚Äòs what the main release is for
---
Salty survivors
---
thats fucking wicked, awesome art
---
Is it really that costy to change the colors of a few cosmetics?
---

---
Source your gif, OP
---
Your crouched behind a wall looking for the next ingredient when you hear " where's the fucking lamb sauce" as you see an injured Claudette turn the corner running from the head chef
---
Oni
---
Hag is better overall but harder to learn. However if you are not a really high rank, survivors will constantly cleanse at which point Plague is better than Hag.
---
Probably Michael tbh. All the evil in the human soul has to have a light side, however small, to define it. 
---
Michael is more like a void of malice. There is nothing behind that mask.
---
Nobody gonna talk about that amazing Ash sweater?
---
Maybe people don't like that he has 2 powers(tp to gen + fake pallets/snares)
---
To be fair behavior isnt a multi-billion dollar company which has been a staple for years, so it's probably a bit difficult to find outstanding designers. Though I still think they're holding back on making them too flashy, for some odd reason ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Imagine if every person was the same. How boring life would be.
---
Some toxic assholles? More than 70% imo. But it's still worth on sale
---
üÖ±Ô∏èonk
---
You can get the base game for like 5 bucks on sale which includes enough characters for hundreds of hours of playtime.
---
I usually like to stack the gen teleport cooldown addons
---
He snatched ya outfit lol that why it took long to load
---
Yeah but lets be real. If they added this there would be like 2 survivors with the best ability that everyone would play. And even if they nerfed those something else would just take its place.
---
She lookin kinda quirky tho üò≥
---
He is the most boring killer to play against. Also his lunge seems as the size as of the Eiffel tower. I know all killers' lunges are the same except Myers but damn...
---
True . I mained Feng and Kate but now Yui is basically both of them..So I'll main her. Plus she had amazing nails like yaaaassss queen
---
Well there's as least 1 toxic survivor out of 4, and like 1 toxic killer out of 10, at least that what I've noticed
---
i want to play clown with 4 elf dwights
---
Right.... so I shouldn't play the killer I like and I should basically follow the survivor rulebook eh?
---
That‚Äòs how I see it. Ruin, Noed and Moris every game, tunneling and camping everywhere. 
---
That amount of sweat would kill the game, people just don‚Äòt realize it
---
Mori will usually make the toxic  survivors to DC
---
Dude I just said he is boring, nobody told you to stop playing him
---
Not the most boring/unfun build to go against tbh.
---
Sorry I'm ignorant, but what makes legion with stbfl so good, because I think he can get easy first hit.
---
This was already asked in the AMA, apparently it‚Äôs low priority
---
Certain things are steadily improving, other things, they've taken steps backwards. Like the hit registration.
---
wat
---
Ive heard queue timeouts are coming eventually. I was thinking throwing in lower priority queuing in addition or even by itself for repeat leavers.
---
I have to think that they simply did not think about how Nemesis interacts with Legion's deep wound timer.
---
So if you're rank one (not hard to get necessarily, mostly a time requirement) you get half a skin or new character every month? The devs took years to even make bloodwebs more user friendly, you're off your rocker if you think they'd ever do something like that
---
The Rank 9 was a Nancy who clearly wasn't at this rank, easily a rank 4-1 Nancy. 
---
I also had a Jake, who seemed to be around purple ranks
---
Laurie was clearly a higher ranked survivor by the way she was playing
---
The Nea was the only one who seemed like she would be at these ranks. 
---
All I'm saying is, low ranks are a bad place for newer survivors/killers. Many people smurf, or just haven't played in a long time. This needs to balance out. Yeah, the rank reset got "nerfed" now with the next update, but still, it won't fix it for people who haven't played for a very long time. Games like these are going to be too much for a newer survivor/killer. They're not used to flashlights, loops, and they won't know what's going on. Sure, rank 16 and up are only allowed for killers/survivors who haven't passed rank 16 yet, but, I don't know if that's broken, but my survivor used to be rank 4, she's now rank 17. 
---
Suggestion: Players under 50-ish hours should be put into a rank rank 20-16 lobby, once those 50 hours are done, you can progress. Make it IP based, this way, no one can create a secondary account to get back, unless they think it's worth it to use a VPN, which would be ridiculous, this would be a decent work around.
---
They deserved it
---
So basically, they want their easy downs again like old legion.
---
Monto's vid had 2 Yuis in the pallet
---
Question on the Kindred change: Is the text in addition to the current text OR is it replacing the current text? If it's the latter, why? What was so bad about it before? If it's the latter, it's going to become a pointless perk that I doubt anyone will run.
---
Hag has a way higher skill gap.
---
IS THAT A GHOST IN THE TOP RIGHT? WHY IS IT THE CUTEST THING EVER???.
---
lol great artwork.
---
Well its not out yet, its in the PTB, which is supposed to get feedback so it can make changes if needed, so no, its not a bad thing, enjoy it when its released in december.
---
Oh no... it‚Äôs hot...
---
I 4k practically every game as leigon, the new legion is about installing map pressure by making them mend and also getting the first hit (as well as other things such as getting information, applying effects such as sloppy and helping thanat etc.) Current leigon is not weak at all in my opinion though a rework of some form is needed.
---
Leigon cant possibly work well as a normal killer with his power used to get downs as his power is literally used to negate how survivors use their tools to create obstacles/ distance from the killer. Without pallets and windows there wouldnt be much gameplay. That's why it's a bad power.
---
And this Russian called you an asshole.
---
The Survivor becomes Oblivious, which completely deletes the Terror Radius for them, so Legion can Frenzy stab them and the timer will start going down even during a chase. Basically a guaranteed down.
---
Its just like when he was released again lol
---
It'd be nice to get a little bonus. Especially when queues can take so damn long as killer and you don't earn nearly as much as survivor.
---
This already was a thing when the game came out, I‚Äôm not much of a programmer but wouldn‚Äôt it still be possible they were shown again unintentionally?
---
It's how his power was made from the ground up. Int3r4ct made a whole [video](https://youtu.be/DkDyYBg5oYw?t=258) about it. In short why you're spotted even though you're behind a wall is because you don't stop getting *detected* for about 0.3 seconds or so after you break line of sight. So if you break line of sight just when you're about to be spotted, you will be broken out of it regardless.  
---
It's weird and pretty dumb imo but that's what how the power works for some reason.
---
Problem with billy is that now you can‚Äôt use his chainsaw for mobility without losing stacks, so it‚Äôs kinda moot on him compared to leatherface
---
Did this yesterday and they were toxic too so I moried them with pleasure
---
He did? I don'y understand Russian so I wouldn't know. He sat and wrote in russian for like 5 more minutes
---
I wouldnt know im a loneer survivor üòÇ
---
Now we need a DbD dating sim where each killer competes to matchmake the survivors.
---
Saw a dev reply saying it's both
---
Behaviour should defintly make more perks and killers viable before diving into this.
---
(I dont dc against freddy bc like suck it up not every killer u get is gonna be one u like) he is one of my top three least favorite killers to go against. 8/10 times its the stupid game slowdown freddy build that makes the game basically stop in its tracks its extremely boring and frustrating. Im not saying he needs a nerf or needs to be changed but it feels like his whole kit is made to annoy the survivors with things like spamable snares, slowdown addons that make the game take ages esp when comboed with slowdown perks, fake palletes that have zero signs of being fake if ur asleep,etc. He is very fun to play as but very unfun to go against.
---
Dude, no offense but I think that the way HOW you formulate your comments is a reason why you're getting downvoted a lot. From taking a quick look at your profile many of your comments just seem rude or pretentious.
---
Survivors just DC anytime the killer gets any kind of am advantage..
---
Wait for Oni the come out (should be around 2 weeks if everything goes good).
---
After that you can still choose , but I would not choose now so close to the next killer.
---
with the addition of the archives i think it would be a little too much. i got 800,000 bloodpoints in 2 days playing only survivor if that tells you something.
---
I think Spirit's mori is also fine, to me it's actually one of the cooler ones. Huntress too is very simple but I like her mori. It fits her. Completely agree with the others though. I really want to see something scarier for Bubba especially.
---
I still don‚Äôt know why killer adept trophies require double pips while survivor trophies just require an escape, why not have it be a 4K instead
---
Sure, I don't recommend playing killer though, unless you want 10m of stress.
---
With 8 stacks getting a normal hit gave them a smaller head start than using your frenzy for the first hit
---
He was never bad in the first place. Nobody knew how to build or play him lol.
---
A day late with this "news".
---
It was a satirical rhyme dud
---
Yea i still have to earn some shards anyway
---
Yeah bonk boy but also the grind required to complete the rift...
---
nah I think people would like shards. I always thought like 100 auroric cells would be good for hitting red/getting rank 1
---
Pizza time
---
In the first two seasons at least.
---
Also consider that there's $100+ worth of dlc which can limit your expiriance of the game
---
Took me 3 hours to find a baby trapper to be able to do this ... I always got stuck being chased after 2
---
It is a fun game, even with the toxicity :)
---
And it is often on sale, so but it on sale.
---
Or they have often free weekend, you can play the game for free, just try it for yourself :) (on PC at least , I don't know about free weekend on console )
---
Killer earns 1 million bp in like 15-20 matches.
---
SO, A FELLOW SURVIVOR CLEANSES,  THEN IMMEDIATELY UNHOOKS AN INFECTED SURVIVOR, THEN CLEANSES AGAIN, THEN REPAIRS AN INFECTED GEN, THEN CLEANSES AGAIN. THE ENTIRE PROCESS FUCKS THE OTHERS WHO ARE BEING CHASED ! AFTER A POINT I GIVE UP ! I DM THE GUY AND TELL HIM TO STOP CLEANSING (NO SHAME IN NOT KNOWING THAT, I HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED THAT AS WELL. THOUGH I VE NEVER CLEANSED THAT FREQUENTLY BECAUSE LOGIC). HE IMMEDIATELY LASHES AT ME TO AND TELLS ME TO START PLAYING LIKE A MAN! 
---
HE SAYS HE KNOWS HIS SHIT, HE IS NO RANK 7 FOR NOTHING!
---
TODAY, ANOTHER GAME, I FOLLOW THIS OTHER DUDE SO WE DO GENS TOGETHER AND STUFF. HE KINDA NODS AS IF HE DOESNT WANT ME THERE, STARTS VAULTING AND CLOSET RUSHING LOUDLY ! BY THE END, HE AND I ARE ONLY THE ONES THAT ARE LEFT. I TRY DOING THESE TWO GENS IN CLOSE PROCIMITY, LEAVING ONE AND SNEAKING TO THE OTHER AS SOON AS THE KILLER APPROACHES. OFC IT IS IMPOSSIBLE SO I START LOOKING FOR THE 3RD, RUN INTO THIS DUDE, HE IMMEDIATELY STARTS MAKING LOUD NOISES ! THEN WE BOTH LEAVE, THIS DUDE DMs ME SAYING ‚Äú DO NOT CAMP‚Äù  !  I AM LIKE ‚Äú U DELUSIONAL ?‚Äù THEN HE TELLS ME I AM A COWARD !
---
KILLER PROBABLY AWARE WHATS GOING ON, GETS THE DUDE IN THE END AND LETS ME GO !
---
THANKS KILLER, APPRECIATED !
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THESE FUCKING ASSHOLES ?
---
Ah ok. That's better.
---
Dude killers break the god pallet as soon as it's down. Therefore it's never a problem again. This perk is gonna be fun, but niche. It's gonna be a meme like Diversion, though not that bad.
---
He only said it was boring relax
---
Should they really cater to veteran players though? I'm fairly new and I am always out of blood points and haven't gotten enough shards for a single item yet.
---
How would that work though? Audrey Two running around the map like piranha plant?
---
BAM BAM
---
&gt;dream snares are absolutely useless compared to fake pallets
---
As a (previously) rank 1 freddy main, I'm gonna respectfully say that you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Pallets are good in lower ranks, but the better you are, the better his snares are. A good survivor will know if a pallet is fake most of the time, but a survivor can do nothing against a good placement of a snare.
---
Also make your choice is busted on freddy btw
---
China and Japan hates each other though
---
Tbh it's not that amazing as people make it out to be especially for a killer bc 1 hook to death gives the least amount of points compared to 3 hooks then death I'm not that thrilled
---
The bloodpoints and rank progress sometime completely disappear for me after a few hours of playing, it‚Äôs happened to my friends before as well. Maybe it‚Äôs just an Xbox thing.
---
I actually have not found any benefit from dream snares so far.
---
But fake pallets are great if it‚Äôs not an SWF.
---
I
---
They are as balanced as keys
---
How about we actually do testing and let at least 5 days pass  for people to learn him and see if he actually needs to be nerfed
---
woa, sherlock holmes is here
---
Instead of running away your coming straight to me
---
This can be applied the other way around bc our shitty games in the past makes us hate the coming ones
---
speedhacks boi
---
It was originally thought you had to participate in the gen from start to finish, not just pop it. Made it much more tolerable.
---
Cant really do that when you get chased for 2 minutes and downed just to see 1 teammate crouched in the corner urban evading doing fuck all and the other 2 looking for ruin making no progress.(at red rank btw)
---
While it would be a reward it's quite tiny but I'd get it
---
This has been getting suggested for years.
---
Also notice how the last survivor didnt die. He wasnt with you nor left, but didnt die from the collapse.
---
I don't remember it in the patch notes, but I did read something about it on the forums.
---
It's going to be a DC bans your matchmaking for a few minutes, with it getting longer and longer for repeat offenders.
---
:( EMBRACE THE NEW COMERS, DO NOT LOOK DOWN ON THEM !!
---
Why not just give rift shards...
---
So u don't want then to fix Nemesis so you can abuse it and become the old legion that had as much counter play as nurse had.
---
If u think logically here nemesis for legion is dumb not bc it makes him stupid op u might as well give u running away. No, it is dumb bc it rewards u for something that is bad aka the stun and then it punishes survivors for something good getting that stun how fucking fun was MoM bc it is the same idea survivors get a + for a - and killers get a - for a +.
---
Think before posting just bc legion is weak
---
Don't mind it man, people just be people.
---
Keep being polite as you are and hope that one day the toxicity will come down :)
---
If everyone start being polite maybe someone we could make it.
---
IM NOT GOOD AT THIS GAME AND IT IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I LOVE IT BUT I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME GET GUD AND ESCAPE YELLOW RANKS.
---
*bonk*
---
It‚Äôs honestly prob just bad wording the devs are sorta known for that sort of thing lol
---
It's like 5 minutes for the first DC and then it continually gets longer the more you DC. The first time that five minutes is just there to give you time to sort out whatever caused you to DC, but more than that and it starts getting heavier.
---
Also, *supposedly* they've got it where it can tell if you genuinely get disconnected as opposed to hitting the "Leave Game" button.
---
Otzdrava showed it off
---
Demo is great once you learn how to play him. I never have issues with him, he always gets me great games. He takes some time to figure out, and he isn't an easy pubstomp killer like Spirit so people don't usually bother with him...but once you know how to use Shred and Portals he is a machine. 
---
But some people miss a few obvious Shreds in the open and take 2 minutes setting up a portal network and call him trash.
---
I wouldn't say she's one of the best. You can destroy her in loops still. She's underrated maybe but not one of the best
---
You don't want it. Servers are too bad
---
#B O N K
---
They can and dont call me Sheryl
---
I'm red rank and always have characters to prestige. If you have every character prestiged to 3 and have all perks on them you're in a really small minority. Bloodpoints as a reward is boring but at least it's better than nothing. At this rate, if I were a douchebag, what keeps me from dcing every game until I'm in rank 20 and then bully low rank killers?
---
Shit i'd be happy for just a fraction of those blood points with nothing else.
---
Well, actually this ever worse than enduring spirit fury combo if you paying attention! You can drop pallet early if you see Legion running this (I mean watching someone becoming obsession and then falling down because of the timer running out), and its way worse because everyone become aware of that if you use this even one time!
---
Spirit fury combo is obviously common on Legion, but there is no way you can know that someone is running that if you not on comms with the person being chased, or seeing it directly
---
Have you ever heard of Sarcasm. I‚Äôm mocking the fact that BHVR is trying so hard for killers to be fun to play against that they seem to often neglect if a Killer is fun to play as COUGH COUGH LEGION COUGH COUGH. I don‚Äôt really think that the Clown is broken. He‚Äôs really weak outside of a chase and even then he can be looped hard at the Rancid Abattoir Storehouse or on Blood Lodge.
---
Personally right now legion imo is meh to play against and okay to play as his kit is ofc the weakest but at around rank 7 I can get consistent 4ks not even abusing the best addons. 
---
But besides my personal experience the good part if legion where to be reworked they aren't stuck to one form as they where with Freddy even though Freddy's rework was well made

Tapp is PC

We know I've seen countless posts about this already where is that guy that posts all the posts of the same info
---
Just mute chat man
---
&gt; Make an "exclusive" charm you get after each rank reset that you only have for that month. So you can show off which Rank you reached the previous months
---
If only survivor charms were actually decently visible.
---
What makes you think Demo is not humanoid?
---
Remember when they planned on releasing uber jason :(
---
You‚Äôre missing what I‚Äôm talking about again. You never normal hit them. You only frenzy stab them once at the beginning of the chase. That first hit triggers Deep Wounds. Once you‚Äôve caught up to them, you simply need to walk at them until Beast of Prey triggers and they begin to bleed out. 
---
This was the moonwalking problem old legion had. You are using the games wonky combo of interactions to have 0 counterplay chases with people. 
---
In a normal scenario this will take some time, sure. And I‚Äôll agree that there are very seldom defenses against it but the fact that the perk combo opens the potential for abuse is bad enough. Legion has already gotten enough kicks in the teeth for bad design that wasn‚Äôt their specific fault. 
---
But I guess we are just going to suffer more Legion DC‚Äôs cause I can‚Äôt seem to explain it well enough.
---
holy sweet mother of jesus, sorry I didn't know this was already posted ;-; I'm just here for the memes..
---
Would be bad working bc usually people DC at least 3 min into a round unless they hear the nurse
---
Oh okay sorry.. didn't know
---
That doesn't happen though does it..
---
BEING HOOKED CONSECUTIVELY DOESN'T MEAN I TUNNELED YOU. YOU WERE FULLY HEALED, ON A GENERATOR AND I CAN'T FIND YOUR IMMERSED TEAMMATES...
---
It would make some survivors more meta and that would be more boring if u have a skin for a survivor which ability doesn't work for ur build idea
---
No its ass. You‚Äôll hate yourself 100 hours in :) I would love to quit this game If only I wasn‚Äôt already too invested in it.
---
It's okay man just gotta stay updated on the subreddit
---
I find plague way more fun than hag.
---
Sure if survivirs don't cleanse you don't get the nuke spit, but they are also oneshot and super easy to track. And you can always bring an apple to get the cleansing going (but i actually prefer if they don't cleanse).
---
Also i rarely get any use out of devour, while infectious is very useful on any killer with snowball potential, like bubba, billy or michael. It's great on her too of course.
---
I've been saying this since release. Even though ghostface is fairly balanced the power is pretty broken in that it is a win win for him. He shouldn't get rewarded for failing at being stealthy - especially when he is trying to stalk mid-chase. I would imagine that also makes him more difficult to tweak.
---
Survivors be like: I'm getting me mallet
---
Interesting if it is.
---
I can say that it definitely shouldn't be though..
---
you think killers who legitimately camp give a shit about that?
---
well if you are having fun with the killer, it's good but... are the survivors having fun AGAINST the killer ?
---
&gt;!now we can spoil anything we want!&lt;
---
If it took a while to do it and there was a limited amount they could break I'd be fine with it
---
Record it bro
---
xD You wouldn't believe how many downvotes I have eaten for defending NOED as the Horror Slasher Movie's equivalent of Killer coming back one more time after being defeated. Survs want everything for themselves only.
---
I did. 
---
*Evil Dio Laugh
---
I'm still waiting for the crybaby survivor mains to start bitching about nerfing Freddy next.
---
If only I had friends
---
WHY DOES THE AMOUNT IF SHARDS YOU GET LEVELING UP DECREASE AFTER YOU GET TO 100 AND IT PUTS YOU BACK AT 1 AGAIN. THIS SEEMS LIKE A PUNISHMENT
---
Xbox?
---
Care to explain how one can "play the game wrong"? Who determines what is the "right" or "wrong" way to play the game?
---
Also, 100% of the challenges can be completed in normal play without doing anything unusual. If someone chooses to play the game abnormally to complete it faster, that's no different than a player who just chooses to play poorly. I fail to see how anything is wrong with the challenges themselves (other than simply giving players an alternate objective that they can choose to follow or not).
---
Bam bam is too good to pass up. May the farming begin
---
The perk that blocks gens for X amount of seconds works great, If you can follow it up with a hook you'll be in a great starting position in addition to if they choose to wait it out while you chip them down
---
Bam bam!
---
Yeah they do that a lot. At least they have a PTB specifically for things like this.
---
Anything depressing and edgy but Joey 100% likes death metal
---

Killers just might stop insta DCing Haddonfield now.

New Map: Sen's Fortress
---
I got matched up with a group of survivors ~10 ranks higher than me (17 vs. four 6s and 7s) and after a terrible match they teabagged me at the gate. Instead of insulting them or berating them for being toxic, I asked them not to teabag. And they insulted me, told me to grow up (go figure), and get used to it. Fuck me for trying to talk to these people like a fellow human being, right?
---
I don't think that stops him from being fully stealthy as much as Spine Chill does. You can't just rotate the camera around and reveal him. you have to focus on him for a few seconds. And if you can focus on him for a few seconds then you can see him in a normal way, therefore he is not being that stealthy.
---
A better way to fix him would be to buff his ability to get around stealthily without being seen - but make sure he is punished for being revealed - not the survivors.
---
are people complaining that legion won't be shit anymore?
---
Is console players are spared from the tilt and do t have to post about it
---
Don't ever start a business, you don't have a fucking clue what cost/benefit or cost effectiveness means.
---
wait im confused, whats going on?
---
When the Allegra finally kicks in.
---
You're not supposed to pick "the best exhaustion perk" you clown. If one is better than the others, it's imbalanced.
---
I am a PC player, but I don‚Äôt know how to access the PTB.  Can I get some help here?
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Rule 34 artists are going wild already. Smh
---
I agree, I'm tired of people immediately whining about how a killer is OP. Oni is A tier now, but he still gets looped outside of his power, and can still definitely lose to an swf. Many survivors are very myopic regarding killer balance and for some reason don't realize that having less than 5 viable killers is bad for game health.
---
Don‚Äôt commit to chases far from the gens. Your perks won‚Äôt do anything if you don‚Äôt get them off gens yourself. The majority of the maps right now are huge, which causes gen pressure to drop quite a bit.
---
I have had the very same situation as you did, but I was more of a Jake. I and Bill left on coldwind with 2 gens, we were crouching on the corner on the map and went into the shack where the hatch was, we then hid behind the hay next to the shack and were nodding &amp; teabagging to each other, waiting when one of us will go to give up to the killer. Bill went, and immediately came back trapper chasing him, lead him to my hiding spot, bill got slugged, then was I right next to the hatch. Evan hooked Bill and came for me, picked me up as the hatch opened, made a step towards the basement, I didn't wiggle. He then sloOowly turnes around to the hatch, stands for a few seconds, then drops me and goes away. What a cutie.
---
Mostly play killer, some survivor. Keys, NOED, and Moris aren‚Äôt fun to play with or against. Everything has an exception like Broken Key aura reading being fun to play with and against and low level moris(but ebony is horrible). NOED is just straight unfun though. It‚Äôs a safety net that holds players back from being actually good at the game.
---
My dude its not about being effective, its about being unstoppable. It wont matter for bad players if it takes a whole ass minute to down someone when most of the people abusing this will get looped for a whole game on other killers. The problem is that if the Legion has this perk combo they _will_ get you down no matter what, they will also lose the game by doing it so, but they will do it all the same; See: Legion at launch
---
Yeah but they're "dead" memes. We're in constant need of rehashing meme formats because macros "die" too quickly.  
---
~~Seriously, though, macros in general are just plain tiresome.~~
---
Then you're in attack cooldown and the unhooked and hurt survivor has more time to get away.
---
What people misunderstand about NOED is they think doing 5 gens is their main objective. NO! Your main objective is to get out, any means necessary. Similarly Killer's job is to kill you, any means necessary. 
---
A killer can lure you to gen rush if he/she is confident about making most of NOED. Just like a wounded surv may go down right before 5th gen completion for adrenaline.
---
Nobody likes to face NOED boosted killers and you dont have to if you do the secondary object as well, totems. There is enough counter for NOED while Adrenaline is still uncounterable . 
---
Also NOED is not much different from Blood Warden if 5 gen done means surv wins.
---
Well here it goes, he‚Äôs getting nerfed because whiny fucks can‚Äôt give it some time and devs love their surv mains
---
Well for starters bubba is not going to contribute much to anything at least legion can slow people down but bubba can hardly win a chase.
---
Piggy can come down to RNG on how long it takes survivors to get their hat off.
---
Ghost face eeeh he can have some strong mind game potential with the insta downs.
---
In my honest opinion here I may be wrong if so correct me I think ur quite new to killer and I would suggest watching people like Otzdrava he makes excellent vids on how to play and in all his vids and streams explains his moves usually
---
Who do u play?
---
You using tiktok. 
---
**Nah I'm good**
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs annoying that the ones I like are lower tier, though.
---
It's a full size wearable mask ü§°
---
yes officer i found him
---
Mainly pig, but I cycle through all of them.
---
Well looking at the battle pass the already ran out of ideas, otherwhise we wouldnt have 5 trapper and 5 plant charms that are simply recolours
---
On xbox, you wait 10 minutes for a match then you get a swf all with flashlights, they dc as soon as you down one early on, and then the other person gets hatch
---
I downvoted to get the post to 666 (it was 668) than i sadly saw it go to 690 :(
---
I love Otz. I do all the tactics and get plenty of downs. It just takes too long going through all the pallets and windows. Even with spirit fury and enduring.
---
If they make cross save letting u make 1 account be the main one then yes
---
Are we gonna completely ignore that this guy just said Freddy's attack range is "cheap"? My dude, all the killers' basic attack range (lunge and hitbox) are IDENTICAL, with the exception of Myers in Tier 1 (shorter lunge) and Tier 3 (longer lunge).
---
Good bam bam boi
---
He has huge potential without ruin, which is where a killer should be
---
Well that's what u wanna avoid I can't exactly sure here and tell u how to play besdies some small suggestions. With due time and insight u will learn what to do and not to do a thing I used to do when I was new was record myself playing no commentary just game and watch it back realizing my mistakes and there are plenty I used to make
---
Come on man, you told me it would be him now suck my dick
---
The thing my hot pocket sees when I drop it
---
Not on PC.
---
If I just used people like Hillbilly I would be perfectly fine. But it feels like most of the roster just can‚Äôt keep up.
---
I mean....depending on how long it took them to break the pallet as a survivor main I‚Äôm kind of okay with this.
---
People go afk during queues that i kept getting survivor games against afk oni's
---
Sounds like slipknot or anything on the heavier side of nu metal
---
No, it really isn't. The entire game is unbalanced. DbD is obviously unbalanced, but nowhere near the extent of Friday the 13th.
---
Pig and Ghostface are definitely good though, from the ones you like. They both lack some mobility, so you will definitely need to strategize more and give up some gens to have better late game. I personally run STBFL on Pig to end chases more quickly, as her rush avoids losing stacks. Pig can stall gen progress really well with her bear traps, so try to use them early on, if the survivors are rushing gens traps will activate and they will have to lose time checking boxes around the map. BBQ is especially good on her since survivors often have to run around to jigsaw boxes.
---
Ghostface is a bit tricky, but aura reading perks like Discordance, Whispers or Nurses Calling are really good on him to locate survivors and sneak up on them with no terror radius. It¬¥s not always worth to stalk people, sometimes you just have to start stabbing.
---
Clearly Michael must find a way to eat all the corn
---
probably varying tiers of hemorrhage
---
It‚Äôs because of dedicated servers. The timing‚Äôs different now and you‚Äôre gonna want to use dead hard earlier than you were used to before.
---
Yes if you don‚Äôt mind the occasional toxic bitch.
---
It has such cool killers and survivors
---
STBFL has been great on Pig. If I get a good enough start that usually works.
---
Pc player here, PTB isn't that amazing as you think. Waiting for a killer game takes forever. Streamers play most of the time with their viewers, but viewers love to troll. I rather have no PTB at all, so we don't get spoilered.
---
But oh well, devs need those tests.
---
Yeah....
---
Oops, started next to Cow Loop or the Love Shack, no God Pallets for you!
---
Ok, but when are we going to stop blaming things on a feature that isn't coming out and start fixing this game? Saying "it's because of dedicated servers," is like saying "because I said so."
---
It's a fine balancing act of keeping survivors busy personally bc of Otz I've just been loving Trapper and it works out mostly for me
---
Some funny men youve been seeing üòÇüòÇ
---
Somethin with the screen writer and the director goin against eachother in court. Since last year i believe they stopped production of everything friday the 13th. Thats why the game isnt getting new content and there wont be any new f13 movies until the lawsuits over.
---
But you can see its the killer or they would have the same face/clothes which doesn't make sense.
---
This idea could work for a shapeshifter killer kinda
---
Thank you very much, ill be sure to keep posting üòâ
---
Keep in mind that the DLC released before season 3
---
I don't understand why people want Pennywise so much. His power in the movies is to turn into what  you fear most, which wouldn't really translate well to the game.
---
ONI seems balanced tho why would they complain
---
Only happens to me when they have the halloween skin
---
Although this is your opinion, you are so wrong.
---
Thank you üòä
---
Dont forget the speed boost to doors with wake up for the optimal door opening
---
I‚Äôll give you mine if you‚Äôre wrong.
---
I love it and ahh i dont know i liked it but i do see the tumblr flavouring you mentioned üòÇ
---
no, just because you‚Äôre one person who doesn‚Äôt purposefully tunnel doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt people who do. and yes, hook rescues can be risky if the killer is tunneling the hooked survivor. unhooking them would be a death sentence. camping is the same way.
---
and yes i‚Äôve had matches where there‚Äôs one person who is less experienced but i definitely don‚Äôt skip out on killing their teammates. at the end of the game, being good at chases isn‚Äôt ever a big deal because the survivor ends up either dying, escaping dead on hook or i give them the hatch. all of which i‚Äôm fine with.
---
i don‚Äôt think people should push the idea that camping &amp; tunneling is okay. it teaches killers to be bad at the game.
---
My reasoning is that by the time you get hook a survivor, there's a relatively good chance they are your nemesis, but rather than furtive "expiring" when your nemesis gets death-hook, instead you acquire a new obsession from Nemesis.
---
I like it. I know if I stay green and purple I'll be able to play casually and chill out after work. When I end up red... it's "nah thanks... little bit try hard for my liking" üëç
---
So I can smash into my BP limit and get nothing? Not until they increase the BP limit from the measly 1 mil.
---
So do killers it seem most people who play this game can‚Äôt handle shit and was emotionally abused as child
---
there's plenty of times you find more then 1 survivor or 1 or 2 or all 3 try to body block for 1
---
BALANCED LANDING LEADS TO INFINITE LOOPS WHERE THE KILLER BASICALLY CANT DO ANYTHING
---
I only do if I know for sure someone is there. Then I uncroutch and attack.
---
No but yes but no but maybe, no yes buy it
---
¬´¬†dedicated servers are never coming¬†¬ª they‚Äôre literally on PC right now.
---
Any you recommend for pig?
---
that‚Äôs the point.
---
It might be okay if it is conditional and maybe on a token system. Like after getting X hooks, gain a token that you can use to destroy one pallet. You can only gain up to 3 tokens perk game. Or something similar, so you cannot use it early to completely nullify loops, but after playing well, you can mess with a loop that survivors have been saving up, or a loop that is next to a gen you want to defend.
---
Might even make perks like Windows of Opportunity/Zanshin Tactics better.
---
This would make the ranking system actually worth to tryhard, because I don't really care that much about ranking up unless it's for the achievement
---
That was awesome!
---
Turns round to see Myers running at you with pallets in both hands... SEE HOW YOU LIKE THE BOOPS!
---
That was well explained, cheers
---
My situation is assuming the unhooker is healthy, obv.
---
If ur going to do stealth I'd say use M&amp;A and whispers and crouch when whispers go off. And use pop and ruin.
---
julie's is 100% nirvana and joy division  i'm sure of that much
---
Because killer is a solo role and longer wait times so they complain more vocally unlike survivors who just complain to each other
---
Well they can‚Äôt really escape before they have the 5 gens done. If NOED activated once gates were opened it would punish overly altruistic or slow survivors, not good survivors who get gates open and get out.
---
He's not. It's a similar position to spirit though in that he doesn't really have counter play during his power but outside of it, he's relatively weak.
---
Outstanding 1v1 capability 
---
Meh 1v4 capability 
---
If played against properly (killing yourself in a locker when he's chasing you)
---
Darkness would surely enjoy this as well
---
I dont blame her ahah thank you üòÇ
---
But I like this
---
The Chef
---
Likewise, there should be another option added where you can just play casually and not play against people the same rank as you. Basically, you could be a rank 1, but playing with all kinds of other ranks (aka the old ranking system except you don't lise your rank).
---
Not easy for me to explain, but hope you get the point. Same with whenever they add a 2v8 mode.
---
He needs ruin. His early game is too weak to go without it.
---
Thank you so much üíñ
---
Myers is the only Daddy, full stop.
---
I like all of this idea...my only issue would be with the blood point cap. There‚Äôs no way to hold any in reserve if they were awarded so anything last the 1mil cap is gone and wasted. More work would have to be out into creating something just to hold backup BP. 
---
Or as another comment suggested just do shards. You can of course convert them with already known shared perks so there‚Äôs your BP reward too?
---
Yeah, no doubt, he and Freddy have even faced off in a comic before and Ash sorta won for the most part if ignore the awful sequel.
---
So it's like reunited?
---
yes and when you hit him instead of tunneling the just unhooked survivor that person doesnt make a difference with the unhooker because you hit the unhooker
---
You should but fair warning, the game is incredibly addictive, especially with friends. If you don't mind repetitive gameplay than you'll like the game.
---
the other exhaustion perks have a wider range of use than BL. BL is more situational then say, dead hard or sprint burst
---
Like when he is in melee range and dances around you?
---
I replied thinking it was possible to have somewhat of a conversation with you, I was wrong.
---
You attacked me thinking I was someone else and didn‚Äôt even bother apologizing. You‚Äôre also trying to belittle everyone who‚Äôs stating that you‚Äôre wrong, than proceed to attack them personally with childish comments that aren‚Äôt founded in any way.
---
You‚Äôre also making nonsense arguments about cosmetics being a priority over stability based on absolutely nothing other than you, just trying to get free upvotes by feeding on other‚Äôs frustration. I have news for you: there‚Äôs more than one team working on the game and most people realize that; you seem not to.
---
Dedicated servers are, in fact, the reason DH is different, whether you like it or not. No, no one can do a thing about it. Stop crying because people tell you you‚Äôre wrong and try to grow up.
---
Got camped by an Insidious LeatherFace for the first time on pc a few days ago. Idk man but what makes me angry is that there's a perk that's good only for camping and it's still there, not being changed or nerfed. Also BHVR gotta start showing to killers that if they stay near the hook while there are no survivors around you loose points, because that happens already but a lot of people don't know about it, so if the game told them that they are loosing points they would stop a little
---
Oh now that would be a cool idea
---
It‚Äôs just ‚ÄúElo‚Äù, not ELO. It‚Äôs named after a person.
---
Considering the entity makes killers indestructible but not resistant to pain I would say he could only knock them out at most and force them to the ground at least via the broomstick. The chainsaw would be difficult to use against trapper if he hits the metal sticking out of him, and doc would shock the poor guy‚Äôs mind away (even if it isn‚Äôt there most of the time anyway... demonic deer head laughing? Remember?)
---
Legion would be easy to knock out unless it was more than one of the gang at a time. Spirits weird. Even if it‚Äôs a game mechanic, she can get hurt by physical objects, like the knife from decisive strike and pallets, so I‚Äôll just assume she would have chainsaw sword clashes that result in a defeated Ash unless he remember he has a shotgun and blasts her in the face mid clash, allowing h to chain saw her arm and send another boom in her gut.
---
Really strong and really easy to play
---
Great idea but this would make people disconnect even more because the ranking system would be taken even more seriously.
---
But it‚Äôs not extremely easy to play around. Survivors only have so many ways to counter a killer. Legion isn‚Äôt in a good place but he shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on a single perk. They should buff him but not in a way that brings back old legion
---
Nah something's up with it. Happens at least half the time.
---
He got it right as he stopped working on it. The video is probably 30 FPS and skipped the skillcheck frame.
---
Why would someone downvote a harmless question like that? Shame
---

SUCK THAT DICK
---
True but also the point of a PTB is to get opinions and to say initial reactions
---
&gt;dev‚Äôs not really doing much to encourage good behaviour  
---
What about just being a decent human being and not a total scumbag as an encouragement?
---
lmao no. you replied with a smartass answer and got checked. sorry it stings. 
---
belittling? yet you're the one who threw the first insult out. that makes sense. nonsense arguments? this game has had sync issues since it came out almost 4 years ago... dead hard has ALWAYS been buggy. maybe they need allocate some of that cosmetic money on a new dev team because the current one is a little too slow. sorry you're offended.
---
You forgetting about the switch? That has dedicated servers as well
---
I think they should simply reward with specfic rank items like other games do. Rank 15 is an item, rank 10 is an item, rank 5 is an item, rank 3 is an item, and winning 10 games as a rank 1 is an item. Stuff around those lines

So

It relies on the survivor seeing them in their peripheral vision. If a survivor looks straight at legion then they would be able to tell it‚Äôs legion, hence why they lose their power when looked at
---
So the main feature of a stealth killers power is for survivors not to look at you?
---
I suggest you back up *your* opinion with some logic. 
---
If a survivor reveals GF without being in a chase then they are either not very good or don't know that his power reveals their location. The only exception would be if you see GF chasing someone else and make an effort to reveal him to help your teammate. But even so that doesn't make it the main feature of his power.
---
On the flip side, they love lucky charms.
---
This is a face I would gladly sit on.
---
What about Adam? I know he has a sweater, but anything else like a Santa üéÖüèø outfit or something.
---
Personally happy that ranking up is pointless. If it weren‚Äôt the sweat in high rank games would get even worse.
---
So then its basically ghost face
---
Spriit prefers booberry funnily enough
---
Be it a video game or not, any type of toxic behavior does not deserve to be rewarded.
---
How about people first learn to play against him? He's been out for a few days on the PTB how the hell would you know if he's OP or not. I doubt half you have even played him or against him, you just sat there, scratched your nuts and watched someone play
---
Just finished level 2 and I'm at tier 40, which is slightly ahead, being halfway through the levels and past the 35 tier halfway point of 70 tiers.
---
Yeah but its still better than nothing sooo why not add it for now until they figure out something better
---
Well yeah but no, I was no saying there are more toxic surv but that 1/4 survivors are toxic and that 1/10 killers are toxic
---
Coward
---
that is very difficult, indeed.  XD  not only is Bubba not that good a killer, but you gotta be lucky and hope the 4 survivors are using the 4 first survivors XD  lol
---
So funny wow... unrelated post.
---
Kimmy is excelling at SoulCycle and Jacqueline is jealous but at the same time acknowledges Kimmy as superior therefor willing to drink her sweat as a way to grow
---
Message the mongrel about this post. It‚Äôs what I did.
---
Rancor + Nemesis
---
I see your point and the appeal of being able to experiment more with perks but I just think it would just be a way for high ranks to punish low. If it still matched groups based on rank and just didn‚Äôt change rank that may be an option.
---
yes, you got checked. you tried to throw a condescending insult at me and got told you could read any other post on any other subreddit, yet i'm still the one belittling lmao. 
---
dedicated servers are being *tested* on pc. i don't know how many times i have to tell you this before you understand. would a link to the official dead by dalight forums where it says this help you out a little more, or are you just here to reiterate your same wrong point?
---
We were just talking about survivors, kinda tired of seeing someone always add ‚Äúso are killers‚Äù. Not saying bad about ya it‚Äôs just... i would prefer one common comment over the common rebuttal.
---
do some more research about the oni please.
---
So, if everyone else starts maining her you don't wanna main her anymore? Are you from Portland, Oregon or something?
---
This just made me think there should be a bone hurting juice kind of thing for all the killer Moris
---
Yes, the lore and design is great üëåüëå
---
But the power feel unsatisfied.
---
The blood drawing is cool tho.
---
Right, but people already love shitting all over the other side not caring if they look like an ass.
---
So what's gonna stop those people from bringing the most meta shot they can and facing worse opponents than usual? Looking like an asshope means nothing to these people and I promise they will flock to such a mode
---
They‚Äôve been there for a little over a month now, the fact that it‚Äôs a test is beside the point. Saying ¬´¬†dedicated servers are never coming¬†¬ª is simply wrong since they already are.
---
I was very very anti this threads idea. But your version definitely changed my mind.
---
Unfortunately, Nemesis does not currently combo with Furtive.
---
Tier 56.
---
Nothing changed though and they buffed him by making an iridescent addon baseline. What is your point?
---
Clown then Plague coming in at 2nd.
---
If you can ignore the saltiest salt to ever salt and players so toxic they make the community more irradiated than the Courier‚Äôs Mile in New Vegas Lonesome Road, go ahead and buy it.
---
That is the thing, however, that I had not considered: how are we going to prevent high ranks from punishing low ranks? My thought on this is that maybe this casual mode has all perks, add-ons and offerings enabled. The cost with this is that you only gain 50% of rewards normally gotten from playing ranked.
---
In all, many things need to be considered, but I believe that if the devs ever add this, they will have thought of something.
---
Soulja boy tell em
---
Plague
---
Spirit and Hillbilly, mostly. Nurse and Huntress are both very strong but so hard to play most killers (at least on Xbox) don't bother. Hag is strong too but idk, she's not a popular choice.
---
wait... so since they're *testing* dedicated servers *temporarily* on pc, without them being established across all systems that have dead by daylight, they're here? so when the ptb's come out to *test* the new killers and survivors *temporarily* on one platform, that also means they're here? 
---
you've been playing this game for how long, btw? and you're still that na√Øve that you're giving these devs the benefit of the doubt? i wish i was that clueless.
---
Plague is actually pretty strong as well, she struggles a bit more against optimal SWF groups but other than that she‚Äôs fairly good.
---
You can insult me all you want, but i have a point. Survivor‚Äôs objective change as the game progresses as you cannot escape unless people die or you complete gens. It‚Äôs a legitimate crutch perk with no use outside of being a safety net.
---
Builds,personally. I usually want to see some interesting builds that people can do with a certain killer (or general survivor) and how they play with them.
---
How are they bad?
---
Rep 47 goki
---
Why do people make this complaint every ptb? Literally aside from Legion and Freddy, one of which was reworked, all killers have either been buffed or kept the same after release.
---
Gotta make that karma bait I guess
---
I think you dramatically over simplified what they said.
---
Everything you said in your reply had nothing to do with his, and in some cases completely misrepresented what they meant.
---
You write it off as they simply haven‚Äôt ‚Äúplayed enough‚Äù and that you don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúrelearn all of it‚Äù but at no point did they mention that‚Äôs what they want or how much they have played.
---
They simply were saying that the game hasn‚Äôt changed that much except for in areas where it is profitable to Behavior.
---
I dunno if the adrenaline makes it worse or what. Or if its because when you lose as a survivor you lose pretty hard. I dunno. But I play both roles and I get survivors t-bagging and messaging trash talk way more. I have never gotten a message from a killer. (Ps4)
---
Survivor: constant screaming
---
Me: crying
---
Well those reward are quite absurd since the seasons are really dhort c8mpared to seasons in other games
---
Woah this is pretty sick is weird that I can smell the clown only from this picture (vomit cigars beer)
---
Do it! I love the pet finder but theres something more fun about running from demons in a sailor costume lol
---
From my own experience on PS4, I'd say Clown and Plague. Don't see too many Demos, either.
---
I try to ignore that sequel. And when I can't, I drink it the rest of the way away.
---
Never see wraith anymotbhaven't had a lot of hag lately either
---
Somebody get this guy off the fucking stage. /s
---
Adrenaline is a reward for doing your job, noed is a reward for failing to do one of your jobs, pressuring survivors off of gens.
---
I feel like the fact that blood orbs spawn on any injured survivor and stay there forever is way too powerful. They should make it so survivor‚Äôs only drop blood orbs within a certain perimeter of the Oni, and the blood orbs should only last for around 30 seconds before disappearing.
---
I play almost only Killer, btw, so absolutely no bias here. It‚Äôs just that his blood rage is already incredibly powerful and the speed in which he gets full charge for it is absurd.
---
get these all the time, I have good internet, but I play with friends over the other side of the world so I end up with bad ping and this happens like 80% of pallet drops
---
Clown, Plague, or Hag
---
you gotta be kidding me right? why do they have to spawn beside the survivor objective?
---
I still say Ash could have got a whole ass chapter with his own level and like... Either Evil Ash or Henrietta as a killer. The map would be... limited, to say the least but still.
---
And we are back to square one, read what I wrote about NOED above please and keep circle jerking Travis
---
in fact had some so bad that I've dropped the pallet, they've been stunned, I've been running away and then teleported back to the pallet to be picked up when I never even saw myself get hit
---
lag be real sometimes yo
---
[deleted]
---
Garbage survivor -1
---
Public Test Build. PC only and it's a version of DbD that Behavior uses to test new chapters before release.
---
you are right they should spawn already broken and give the permanent adrenaline effect on survivors.
---
This is the same for me on Hag and Plague - I had to take off all those skins for every killer who had them.
---
But I'm saying, outside the entity's realm, The killers just kind of existing more or less as is but without the entity's protections, could he do it?
---
Ok I just reached the halfway point. I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt complete it :D
---
Damn didn‚Äôt know some people already finished it :D
---
*nerfs legion more so deep wound meter never moves*
---
&gt; you gotta be kidding me right? why do they have to spawn beside the survivor objective?
---
Agree with everything but the amount. 50,000 per rank is pretty excessive unless they remove the 1,000,000 cap (which they may have I never save up that high anymore).
---
I‚Äòm 36. and that‚Äôs only cause I‚Äôve been sick for the past week and couldn‚Äôt go to work :D
---
Using my real name does nothing but make me see that you want to win this argument so bad you‚Äôre going through my post history to find a point. Good job. We may be back at square one but i‚Äôm simply stating facts. NOED is simply a reward for failing to apply enough pressure or a perk you can use to speed up the game if you kill 3 survivors AND close hatch. That‚Äôd all it does. Adrenaline is a crutch, i‚Äôll admit it, but at least it rewards you for playing well instead of poorly.
---
Twice ? Also, if I remember correctly the survivor's aura turns white when he dodges the hit with MoM.
---
*When all 4 survivors go down due to deep wound*
---
He's hella daddy
---
People thought that he would be added because DBD Twitter followed Stephen King
---
Does No Mither leave blood orbs at the start of the game or does it never give oni a single blood orb
---
Well now I just love her 10x more
---
everyone always overestimates or underestimates things on the ptb, there‚Äôs no in between. we won‚Äôt truly know how balanced he is until we have more time spent with and against him
---
Clown. His power is not as strong as Demogorgon or Freddy in chases, so you don't really have a reason to play him unless its for fun
---
Well last time I saw somebody use mettle of man their wasn‚Äôt a white aura. I think it was mettle of man though because you hit them once to injure then you hit them again but it didn‚Äôt do anything and then you hit her again but it never made contact which was weird and then you hit them and put them into the dying state.
---
That's not exactly tunelling though, that's punishing survivors for being fucking morons
---
Tunelling when it's toxic is when you see someone completely ignore everyone else to catch that one survivor, even if it would be simpler to just start downing the others
---
Me: Why did you camp and tunnel so hard?
---
Them: Well if you stopped looping middle building I wouldn't have to tunnel
---
Me: I'm literally running for my life sis
---
Same rules apply. Dead By Daylight, Not Death by Tunneling/Camping.
---
Overwatch. Competitive. Great joke. If Overwatch can have a competitive scene then so can DBD.
---
or at least corrupt intervention
---
Yeah i'm definitely gonna read tips for a killer thats been out for 2 days, ruins all the fun
---
I can‚Äôt play on weekdays because I had a 78 percent in my history class.
---
Everyone's been complaining about "Any means necessary". Its easy to counter. Just break the pallet, or at least the strong ones, so they cant use it.
---
This however has no counterplay whatsoever and will make old PTSD Legion return.
---
But yeah, AMN is the problem.
---
I hate this game but i can't stop
---
I have not seen a single Nurse since the rework. 
---
With that said, I would definitely say clown is the least used followed by hag and freddy. I know they are used a lot more than Pig and Plague, but I personally rarely see them
---
red ranks on PS4 I see almost no people playing doc
---
That sad cat photo gets me every time XD
---
Legions ass
---
Deep wound wont be as short any more. It's getting nerfed if the ptb hits live. Plus they nerfing the save the best for last build for legion as well. Wont work anymore either.
---
I don't see the issue.
---
Surge is still a very situational perk that can whiff easily due to not being close to a gen, not using a basic attack, or interrupt grabs/locker grabs. It even has a 40 second cooldown so you cannot abuse it with multiple downs. It cannot synergize with Pop since it already puts the gen in a regressed state, and it usually only hits a single gen. Even with the 18% regression as we thought, it would only be useful on specific killers in combo with Surveillance.
---
Meanwhile Pop *cannot whiff*, has no cooldown, gives you guaranteed 25% on a gen of *your choosing.* There is a reason why it's a top tier meta perk, and having a second option (that isn't even worth running with Pop because of the anti-synergy) would only be healthy for the game.
---
You cannot derank past 15.
---
Also I've said this many times. I have been absolutely annihilated in a swf by a killer who doesn't face camp, I'm tilted either way but it's a lot more satisfying to get use out of offerings and be killed by a good killer than being tunnelled out of a game in five minutes because a gen got done through ruin and now the killer is pissing their pants.
---
Unless someone like me exists who decides she is new main
---
Thats great, but I can also relate to that at the same time, making me sad.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dzjqt5/secret_behind_huntress_strength_revealed/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

* Most crossposts are automatically removed, as they are typically unreleated to Dead by Daylight.

That's because the fourth one DC'ed
---
true, but right now i would rather play a enjoyable balanced match where no one leaves then have a quicker terrible match because of the garbage mode we have right now. You can't win them all, i just think it would be better this way
---
im 35
---
I'm just gonna leave it as agree to disagree.
---
Thanks! It‚Äôs really my first SFM poster that I actually worked hard to get a nice result from, so I‚Äôm glad everyone seems to like it üòä
---
Caving their head in is like sweeping up a beach, nothings going to change
---
I couldn‚Äôt work well with the poor girls face üò≠
---
idk I think oni needs buffs in certain areas but nerfs in others
---
meh, i‚Äôm thinking that they will nerf legion again
---
Have you witnessed old Legion? That one thatll always down you with no counterplay? Guess what, that crap returns with Nemesis.
---
They just buffed them tho.
---
It's a mandatory blood donation of half your life to continue playing the game . It does seem to come online quite quickly in all seriousness
---
All the cry baby survivor mains are just gonna cry till they get what they want nothing we can really do
---
You can on reset.
---
"Oh,you're aproaching me? Instead of looping, you're walking right to me?"
---
I always wondered about the numbers on those add-ons. Thanks for this.
---
Can you tell me what the purpose of the ptb is?
---
Only oversight on the 50% rewards on such a mode, is that majority of people in red ranks, don't really need bloodpoints, so it's just an easy mode for them, that they'll likely wind up spending their time in.
---
I mean yea sure, but nerf the AoE of the bat and increase cooldown after coming out of demon dash without hitting.
---
No, you're correct. It was nerfed and then re-buffed at one point during the PTB cycle.
---
You mean that playing on youtube doesn't count?
---
"Oni is loopable" LUL
---
https://youtu.be/DioP0OxLtQ0
---
This is listed as a known issue in the PTB patch notes.
---
Doc, Demo, Clown are almost never seen at rank 1
---
Only difference is Id feel better after bonking them
---
I think this is a brilliant idea just maybe without the cosmetics
---
Quick PSA: This game is a slasher movie simulator, not Fortnite.
---
That's like  literally any game that supports console and PC
---
Undertale fanbase be like
---
Bonk them back to pre worked freddy
---
HOT TAKE ALERT
---
You've got to be kidding. They're supposed to be hidden to where they can't be seen walking around from 20 feet away.
---
Yeah actually wished more people would play/test it actually and it would last longer then two weeks. there is always something that gets changed after the release anyways yk.
---
It‚Äôs not a slasher movie simulator, it‚Äôs an asymmetrical horror game with slasher characters(and not even THE slasher, jason due to legal issues). I swear you didn‚Äôt even read the sub description but you go through my post history.
---
Well I'm console and can't help you with that but I wish you good luck
---
Always a good laugh
---
Im not talking about points. The survivor should get points anyway for something like that. But I would rather have no points and remain hidden.
---
The survivors are still meant to be the ones hiding, they seem to forget this when designing GF.
---
Bro you just posted OG Freddy you are going to lose blood points bro
---
So you like more serious builds and useful ones? Might be situational stuff but gives that satisfying feeling when it works?
---
They're both Asian and female. That's pretty much the only thing they have in common.
---
To show off really. Lol
---
It‚Äôs not worth much other than just bragging rights plus it kind of makes you stealthy for some survivors.
---
Tru
---
In all honesty, there is no way to truly make this work because there will always be that single rank 1 that ruins fun for others.
---
I'm thinking that Spirit Fury, Enduring and Nemesis will go good together on Myers since you'll want to eat pallets and be rewarded for it further.
---
Which one was screaming?
---
Thoughts on the twitch rivals thing they did?
---
Yep. Trapper has the Jason aesthetic,  just like Billy was based off Leatherface and Legion off the Ghost Face.
---
It was really boring to watch tbh
---
They made gonewild for that. Keep it there.
---
for me its mostly Ash and Davids. Almost all claudettes play fair with me but i can never see them
---
Situational or not doesn't matter fact of the matter is that it doesn't make sense for BL being the only perk with a passive buff
---
Dude I dont get what this guy is on. All this complaining but ignoring that they are 1 hit kill. Tf you need a power for.?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgSkP4bZy9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgSkP4bZy9o)
---
Very rarely ? I don't know about you, but almost every game there are at least one or two pallet that I don't break immediately. Just because the survivors runs away instantly or I manage to mindgame them and they stop playing the pallet. And if I decide to destroy it, I'd give them too much of a head start and lose pressure. I don't like this perk just because of SWF, in solo it's pretty bad, but as a SWF, like lots of stuff, you can really abuse it.
---
I don't use steam for launch (xbox beta on pc) can I still opt in?
---
Don't come here expecting to find an answer. Most of this subreddit is barely at purple ranks. 
---
If the survivors decide to bring toolboxes and rush, you can't do anything.
---
The whole "Drop chases, check generators so you apply pressure" doesn't always work against good survivors. They'll just sit on a generator as soon as you leave them and they'll simply hear your terror radius then run away to a pallet. 
---
The only thing that helps is letting them finish the generators that are far away or in a dumb place then bring Enduring/Spirit fury or Pop goes the weasel and stay around the gens that are close to eachother
---
True, though it‚Äôs a minor change and you can‚Äôt buy bloodpoints and perks really anyway.
---
Rank changes have been asked for a while along with Colorblindness settings that I desperately need but have yet to see.
---
We got a survey with it as a option and nothing since.
---
For real it's been two days
---
I HATE PLAY WITH RUIN BUT I DONT HAVE OTHER OPTION FIX THE SPEED OF THE GENS DEVS
---
or also have a higher downtime when he misses. Legion loses his power and cant see fuckall traces while moving at 5ms and all he does is injure you. This guy..., this guy 1 sec breaks pallets, can flick his instadown m1 while dashing at double his ms.   
---
He doesnt have to be as weak as Legion, but at least he has to be skillfull with his power. Not another top tier brute force killer that has no playstyle except easy downs
---
Well we were playing against The Oni and my friend was like "Oni is two letters off from Onion" and my dumbass said "ONI ONI ONI ONI" like a fucking goblin and thus the meme was born
---
Well let's twist it if a person on ur team DCd just bc they didn't like X at the start of a match would u be frustrated in the fact they left making it harder to win?
---
Wait, 155 total or relatively? That's 1.5x the speed of a survivor running!
---
Yesterday some dude totally fucked his own teammates by disconnecting after him not being able to dodge my chainsaw. I guess he was pissed since he was higher rank, he probably didn‚Äôt like the fact he went down in one chainsaw. 
---
They could have totally won that game but I compeleted my kill the entire team challenge so I am not complaining lol
---
Oh boy... You do not what are you even playing. And all killers in slasher movies, from the movie Psycho to similar movies in current times are slashers. Yes Norman Bates, Mike Myers, Jason Voorhees, The Thing, Freddy,  Mrs. Voorhees, Chucky, Ring Girl, etc etc. all are slashers. Coz they wield a sharp object and kill their preys one by one, that means Bubba too. Only exceptions will be Hag and Demogorgan. But sometimes you need to blur the line to keep the genre fresh.
---
But not...easily
---
I would take 6 weeks over monthly. The season is so short it looses value. Quarterly would be 10 times better.
---
you say prayer beads arent why you leave but then go on to say prayer bead spirit is annoying and you just DC, HOWEVER, I do feel your pain even tho personally I would never DC. The reason you‚Äôve gone against them so much, as im sure you kno, spirit is getting nerfed and prayer beads will no longer exist or, they wont make you silent when phasing i should say. So most people are using up all their prayer beads before the nerf which i honestly expect the first week of december. You aren‚Äôt in the wrong and the majority of the dbd community will probably agree. Everyone hates spirit lol although i feel you just gotta learn to play against her i escape spirit games like 80% of the time now after facing so many of them and im rank 1 survivor so they arent shitty spirits. sorry for the long response also lol didnt want you to think i was just bashing on you for the first sentence.
---
I mean... that's how it usually is in games that involve loadouts, if both sides choose what to bring in depending on map then both gain advantages. But since this is asymmetrical it might not be perfectly balanced, but i don't feel like depending on RNGesus is better. It doesn't sit right with a ranking system. If the game wants to be casual then it's fine then. But i am not sure what it wants honestly
---
Both. Sometimes I like searching for a meta build for a character I don't understand well yet or need help with, sometimes I just want to see a funny combo. 
---
For reference, Monto and Otz usually have the kind of stuff I am looking for.
---
2000 shards for 150k bp is a horrible trade.  I can get 150k bp in 2-3 games with bbq and survivor pudding.  It takes way way way more than 3 games to get 2k shards
---
THERE SHOULD BE A SETTING TO HIDE END GAME CHAT SO YOU CAN REVIEW END GAME STATS IN PEACE WITHOUT HAVING SALT THROWN IN YOUR EYES FROM THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN
---
More like discussing about everything that‚Äôs not fun to play against. He‚Äôs all about making dbd a better game.
---
&gt; btw these 4 games hex got broken at 30 second mark.
---
It might also be because checking on your Hex seems to be the first thing you do in each of these games.  
---
At least in my experience, the main reason I ever spot/destroy a Hex totem early is because I can see the killer checking it or going in an odd direction.
---
I tend to hover around rank 10, and I‚Äôd say that the least played are Clown and Doctor. When I play survivor, I tend to see lots of Trappers and Huntresses, but I‚Äôve only gone against two Clowns and one Doctor.
---
lmao take my upvote
---
I do have Ash at P3-50, and I'll probably do Bill as well, but the other survs, I'm just looking to get their teachables, and get them with the perk builds that I want for them (I want each of my survivors to do different things)
---
Why...
---
No, this is to radical. Could never work. Makes to much sense.
---
People actually crying about him? He‚Äôll end up mid tier as best i reckon.
---
If you watched the video he said he loves him and he‚Äôs hunks he‚Äôs a bit strong but admits he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs change.
---
I'd say nurse or hag (at least what I've noticed on PS4)
---
Offerings for maps are just another unreliable mechanic in this game that's built around grinding for currency and random bloodwebs like a damn mobile game
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Hell yea, if they want to be a competitive game with a ranking system they can't make random maps that can fuck up your whole game
---
Yeah I experienced this last night. Of all the games I played the only one that was laggy was against a spirit.
---
There is designing for how people are supposed to play and there is designing how people do play.
---
Unless you want more Shroud of Separations, I'd rather they do the second and not the first.
---
Hag and Demogorgon
---
Exactly!!! it‚Äôs a PUBLIC TEST BUILD. They literally want your feedback. You can have fun while doing it but people don‚Äôt need to be mad when people talk about what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs bad.
---
DeBicAtEd SerBeRs
---
Seriously though it happens to me sometimes, just forcing your lunge to stop short and randomly wiffing attacks that should have hit.  I don't know for sure but i believe it's dedicated servers since that's when the problem started
---
Make them get slammed into the ground
---
Honestly it would make sense that legion should relay on his power bc it gives him perfect mobility to control but he can't down anyone with the power and bc it gives such amazing mobility with the only downside being he can't see scratch marks or blood makes it very weird. 
---
He just needs a completely rework bc his power currently is questionable on how to make good while it not being annoying to play against
---
Seems fair
---
My friend and I made our own version of this some time ago, it's pretty hardcore.
---
Have you seen how hard it is to turn on a dime?
---
Oni is pretty hard countered by Windows.
---
Clown, hag, demo and nurse which makes sense nurse is just so powerful it's boring
---
Trust me, it's not. This Reddit is full of each side bitching about each other.
---
I never upvoted post on this subreddit so fast great job man! Devs u know what to do
---
In this case it puts the status on injured survivors anyway, is there a way to give either status or the combined one to healthy survivors? I feel like it would be less cluttered and make sense because Haemo is a weak status effect anyway and feels like something that should come with mangled to make more sense from both a game play perspective and a logical perspective
---
Survivors are reduced to a fine, bloody mist and waft away to safety.
---
Jane gets tunneled stupid often due to the booty though.
---
So all 4 survivors stop playing for a few months to get to rank 20?
---
I use Franklin's/NOED on a Scratch mirror Myers. No surprise survivors are acting like they're drunk in those games.
---
Nah dude. If you derank to 15 and reset happens you fall further.
---
OhTofu or just Otz I used to watch Monto and No0b3 but they got annoying to listen too that isn't saying anything about their content it's good. But for no0b3 I just had to stop after hearing him complain about hitboxes for the 50th million time and then ask "how does that hit" when he very often complains about his shitty network LIKE GET THE HINT ALREADY JESUS
---
no someone with thicc skin won't complain about others complaining. He would just say nothing.
---
I don‚Äôt give a fuck what it says that should not hit. You have brain damage if you think that is an excuse
---
What if they tied ranked seasons to the rift rewards, that way rank wouldn't reset until the rift  pool ends and have special cosmetics and rewards for both sides.

My hero &lt;3

only big games dont forget about our small indie game creators
---
Holy shit 21 upvotes THANK YOU!!
---
But you cannot depip in those ranks.So uou climb back to 15 even faster against noobs.
---
Ok i guess
---
If I don't do it, who will?
---
Fair enough, I just wanted to mention it.
---
Although I do not need a colorblindness setting I definitely see the need for it and I emphatize with those who have to play without it.
---
We can only hope it will be implemented in the future.
---
MANY THANKS, MY FRIEND! MAY THE ENTITY SMILE ON YOU &gt;:)
---
Oh good, like a week earlier than i though
---
I often run NoED on my pig and trapper, and often get two or three kills without it.
---
The only reasons anyone ever gets killed by NoED is because they either stupidly stayed in the match to save knowing it was active, and
---
Alright first overwatch had it world cup less than a year ago while idk when the last official dbd tournament was since it was such a joke. And beside that it's also on part of developer balances and skill cap.
---
I won't say it's a waste to use blood rage while chasing a injured survivor bc with demon dash u could end the chase much faster and with a downed person u got map pressure which could snowball into another down plus his speed let's u loop around the map before the downed survivor is ready to be picked up
---
Im seeing less lights all together
---
23 but I haven't been playing much
---
I feel like you are arguing but I am not sure against what. I‚Äôm just saying it is entirely possible to play against new killers by deranking and brand new killers by deranking and getting hit with reset. But even brand new killers can hit 15 by sheer luck within 3-4 days. So... your point is that no one can de rank and play against new killers? Cause that is absolutely not true.
---
It's a hack.
---
"first impression" that about sums it up
---
this. and honestly increase the BP cap, sometimes it only take a couple hours to hit it and I don't wanna prestige anyone til I use their good add ons, but all my characters are level 50 so I feel like it's usually a waste to level them more
---
Tactics might actually be good on Nurse - if your muscle memory is good enough, being able to see the exact location of vaults and pallets within a jungle gym could be game changing.
---
Bill is who I‚Äôm currently working on.
---
I have a few P3 already but only 1 is lvl 50 P3 and that‚Äôs Laurie cause I love her scream, it‚Äôs really close to the classic horror scream.
---
It's a TEST. It's not the actual game yet dingus. They TEST it to see what's wrong with it.
---
Latancy or reaction from being hit
---
Ok
---
Y‚Äôall hear summ?
---
I mean I guess but a 1v3 is better than having a sandbag
---
PS4 is spirit ghostface and Freddy/Myers
---
Wait then why does the title say oni ruined dbd if you love the oni
---
b√∂nk
---
I'm still trying to see the issue with keys. How are they exactly a major problem?
---
But he loses his power immediately when he picks up a survivor and his power doesn't last long, He's basically a Myers that is able to run fast
---
What is this supposed to mean? I need a translation.
---
Because I just don't want to play until he comes out.
---
I KNOW YOUR PAIN I AM IN THE SAME SITUATION I STAR TO USE EBONY EVERY NIGHT BECAUSE ITS THE ONLY FORM OF HAVE A BALANCED MATCHES AGAINTS SWF
---
His perks fucking suck.
---
Ooh ok yea im probably not gonna go on til hes out too dint wanna tire myself out if dbd before the new chap drops
---
You're gonna be disappointed when people learn how to play against him properly or after feedback he gets nerfed. Either way sounds like you won't be here long.
---
Yeah, if they heal they won't see you coming, though if you're ghostface you can just go no terror radius to the hook can you not?
---
That is really good

---
Right? What's the point? I have played this game enough to know that the scooby-doo chases are getting stale for me.
---
Agreed more between 15/20k
---
Unless they decide to play super immersed and you don't find anyone until 2 or 3 gens are popped. I was messing around with him on ptb last night and it's definitely really hard to get that first hit or two if survivors don't want to give it to you. Then you have absolutely no power. And ruin is basically the only early game slowdown perk you'd have at that point, so you'd need tracking perks to help. I feel like it's going to be mandatory to run discordance and ruin on him, then maybe thrilling tremors, and either nurses calling or another slowdown perk.
---
I'd say just the bp reward would be good. It's something you normally get through multiple avenues, so there's not really a reason to be sweaty about it.
---
That said 50k per rank is way too much.
---
Or was out shopping for knee pads.
---
Yep! That's what I do. I get far enough away so someone rescues, then pop Night Shroud and run back to the hook and hit the rescuer. It was already fun but with NEMESIS? Can't wait.
---
Increased recovery from missed shred. By a lot.
---
It's been a while since I've last seen this here
---
At least you admitted to being new. Because it definitely shows.
---
stop using hex perks if you have such issues with them?
---
It's usually Neas who DC for me
---
Yea the game can be stale and get old quick but I depends when a new chapter comes out it gets exciting again I try playing both sides so I dont get bored by playing only one
---
Maybe he will get nerfed. Maybe not. I've been here for a long time. We finally got a well-designed killer that feels good to play. I don't care if survivors "learn." It's not about what is fun for them. It's about what's fun for me, and Oni is the most fun I've had playing this game. No other killer has come close for me in terms of fun.
---
DID YOU ALL BRING PURPLE TOOLBOXES OR WAS HE JUST BITCHY?
---
r/oddlyspecfic
---
Even with his power he can be looped to all hell, the charge doesn't turn well so it as far as I've seen it doesn't help much with stuff like jungle gyms or loops. It definitely is an issue when going from one loop to another, but if it wasn't then it'd straight up be uesless.
---
my man.. homie.. that's just..
---
I think he is up there with Billy but not as strong as Spirit or Nurse
---
Oh right, unless he's a new killer then yes, That one chase he might now lose, But he still gets looped a bunch no?
---
It is not 18%. It's 100% confirmed by the devs that the total is always 8% regardless of the circumstances. There's a video by entity education and literally counts the pixels and shows mathematically it is 8%.
---
I'm as dissapointed as everyone else because I think like 8% is really shit in terms of regression. If you just down someone from a chase, all other survivors are working on gens. So even if they are in 32m radius they get like 6 seconds taken off? 
---
I really wish there was some variety in slowdown perks. Even pop goes the weasel isnt very strong.
---
If anyone fell into the mental trap of thinking the Demogorgon was good, that's on them. I was hyped because he looked cool and I like Stranger Things. His power sucks, he sucks. B- at best seems generous for a killer whose entire kit is just loopable as always. Demogorgon also isn't fun. Portals that provide no gameplay? Not fun. A shitty little dash-roar? Not fun. Getting looped because you're basically just a "long range" m1 killer? Not fun.  
---
Oni might get nerfed. He might not. I won't speculate. It won't matter to me though, because he has all the things that make Dead by Daylight fun. He has a pallet break, a sprint, a 1 hit down, the ability to hit and absorb blood while waiting to do all that. He's got lots going on. No one else does. They're boring - that's just it. They don't do "enough." Hopefully he gets to a place where both sides are happy with his balance but I'll be playing him everyday after he comes out and through any nerfs. As someone who P3'd Freddy before the changes, I've suffered through worse than whatever they do to Oni.
---
Back when dailies were worth doing. 
---
F.
---
**Stealth. Killer.** You do realize that there are different types of killers, right?
---
it'd make being robbed of rank 1 every month hurt a little less at least
---
I hate how survivor mains get spoiled while the killers get bullied
---
If you give Bill lvl 3 iron will he's still loud af
---
Exactly. I would be fine with NOED if it didn‚Äôt need you to not do your job. Imagine if you got NOED for hooking each survivor once.
---
I almost don‚Äôt want to do them lol. They must be preserved
---
I think most people just hop on twitch, open up otz, tru3, fungoose, etc. And watch them dominate (becuase they are in the top .1% of killers) and think oh that's op
---
this is a good idea. like how hearthstone gives players a unique cardback every month (or used to, haven't played in years). DBD could give us a unique charm that has different tiers based on your rank.
---
So basically like it does with killers?
---
Yeah, how about no. Survivors have the ultimate weapon against him. A goddamn third person camera. The fact that you gloss over how powerful this is shows how biased and shortsighted you are.
---
Had this happen on ps4 it was a jeff and they outran bloodlust 3 easily. They also had no exhaustion perk.
---
Literally everyone
---
Tell me why i was WAITING for the "hey you, you're finally awake" skyrim meme LOL
---
I'm usually lower rank so I see one occasionally, but they definitely are rare.
---
Today is a sad day for blendettes
---
In my experience, 9.5/10 the killer breaks the pallet almost immediately. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not red ranks or something but I definitely see a very high amount of broken pallets by the end of my games.
---
I PROBABLY BROUGHT A BROWN TOOLBOX. I DID AT LEAST TWO OF THE GENS WITH THAT AND THEN WITHOUT A BOX.
---
BEING A KILLER MAIN THOUGH, I CAN DEFINITELY SAY THEY WERE A PRETTY BAD KILLER WHO DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PUT PRESSURE ON SURVIVORS. LIKE I MADE MULTIPLE MISTAKES THAT GAME AND RATHER THAN FOLLOW UP THE KILLER JUST WALKED AWAY.
---
Why would forever Freddie run end game perks? The game never ends. That's the point.
---
They removed the shred charge addon
---
"I can't blind the shit out of you without getting closer"
---
Yep had a nasty lne last night.
---
It‚Äôs because dead hard‚Äôs invincibility frames don‚Äôt start till the actual dash animation, it happens like 0.5 seconds after you press the button, but the exhaustion is applied right when the button is pressed. That‚Äôs why scenarios happen where you end up on the ground but you‚Äôre exhausted.  
---
BHVR said at one point that they were gonna change dead hard so the invincibility happened right away, but everyone assumed dead hard was unreliable cause the killer was host, so it never got changed.  Hopefully they make it way more reliable in the future...
---
He's bad on loops.
---
I don't understand what you are trying to say... people play in all kinds of different ways. The more variation in ways to play the better.
---
Pfft I welcome more shrouds of separation. I hate starting with teammates, it is a huge disadvantage. Why we have offerings that facilitate this, is beyond me. I have tons of them stacked up unused on characters.
---
4 survivors placed well around the map can cause a lot more trouble than 4 survivors all in the same quarter-zone. It's like doing the killer a favour. Even if your plan is to 'gen rush'...
---
I don't really play killer, so I don't get why everyone's saying Nemesis is going to be so useable with Legion.
---
He gets the sound thingy right away right? It builds up but even a second is enough to know someone is looking at you
---
Ghostface is awful. Having no TR is fun until you realize you actually can't do fucking anything about loops or closing distance in chases. Your entire power is built around the survivors being bad at the game. When they're not, you're arguably the worst killer in the game. SWYF also turns Ghostface into a joke. I won't touch corn maps either right now. I'm P3 as GF and he's boring as shit - baby back bitch of a killer.
---
You dont see the problem with people DCing?
---
Looks like a dude
---
Looking at the mentality of this post makes me so darn happy I stopped playing this game 2 months ago.
---
Sat in a lobby as demogorgon yesterday waiting to prank some fools for like 10 minutes then decided I‚Äôll just back to live

Moments before disaster hiroshima 1945 (colorized)
---
I hate corn
---
he is super overloaded and his power is busted af. thats why it will take extra steps. cause its a billy thats easier to use and more powerful
---
But if shards become more readily available (like from rank rewards) it becomes less of an awful trade
---
This was a really cute post, take my upvote and a reset pallet
---
Doesn't dark devotion kinda do the same thing? Also, when was the last time anyone actually went down due to legions power? It either will be broken, or it just don't work at all.
---
Yeah, no shit. That still doesn't discard anything I said. Myers and Pig don't get random bonuses that tell them where survivors are located for no reason (aside from failing to stalk someone).
---
Why is looping a baby Hag fun? Even at high ranks, either they pick Billy or Nurse or you take 'em to fucking loop city. Then you get BT'd off a hook, finally downed after a full commit to the BT hit, then you DS off his shoulder and loop him 3 more times before the gates pop and you adrenaline out. I could just go punch a defenseless toddler.  
---
At least the toddler wouldn't suffer for an extended duration of time.
---
And tuff of hair
---
Base-kit Oni is perfectly fine, his charge takes a while and even with strafing and turning at the same time he can't really navigate around short loops with it. The real issue is his addons, his charge speed addons and movement speed addons need tweaking/nerfs, because they're busted. 
---
Also, I think the best way to make him more enjoyable for survivors is, oddly enough, to buff him so that he can pick people up without losing any power. Currently he's frustrating because not only is he extremely good at multi-downs in his power, he also can't pick anyone up without losing all of his power he spent so long earning, so most Onis just turn into slug machines and have 4 people on the floor, and being one of those 4 sucks.
---
they done an amazing job with both yui, oni and their cosmetics
---
i've discovered a pretty good combo with distortion when I realize the killer is running nurses.  If I have a medkit.  Instead of healing myself to full, i just 99% myself.  Then if the killer pops up, i finish the heal and head to the corn.  No scratch marks for 10 seconds.
---
Yeah OP's suggestion would literally cap out BP instantly lol
---
Yah sorry
---
Not really, the charge speed of his power really is too slow to be used nearly as well as say the demogorgons lunge in curvy loops or even T walls
---
True, lots of killer mains or survivors mains give some stupid advice and scream their one sided opinions. Just play both roles, like damn... It just helps you understand how to play both roles so much better and ubderstand/learn new strats.
---
Green ranks is honestly the most annoying ranks. It's full of assholes. So yeah, people shouldn't complain too much until they spend a couple of hours in that green hell.
---
The fact at least one person understands makes the entire thing worth it. I hope you got to play Oni. He is a fucking blast.
---
But then there is no point for them to release dlcs they worked so hard on because nobody will buy them anymore, unless they are licensed of course. Same with the skins, although people will pay for skins if they look good. We also have to think about their well-being
---
Instead to learn to play you dc‚Äôd. Nice, that‚Äôs the way
---
We are legion for we are many
---
Which depresses me. I've wanted a perk to dunk on people for stunning me since I played the beta. Looks like I'll have to keep waiting.
---
The orbs dont stay there forever. Its unclear how long they stay but its certain that they dissappear. There are some things that need to be fixed but I dont think the orbs are an issue
---
Ptb is awesome, specially having to wait even longer queue times as killer.
---
Such an amazing idea I salute you
---
Wait they added it? I haven't got on in a few days.
---
Seen some funny dudes you have my man üòÇ
---
I'm not saying ignorance should be taken into consideration, I'm saying that it is a likely reason why GF in lower ranks rely on the reveal as the main part of the power...?
---
&gt;Or do you think that he should just be booted out of his power with no indicator? Let's give him a 4 second stun when someone reveals him too. That sounds fun.
---
Please try and read what i have said without jumping to conclusions. I'm not saying he should be nerfed Im saying his power should be reworked so it isn't backwards. Yes if you have a reveal function, he should be booted out without a reward. Because that is him failing. To facilitate that maybe make it harder to reveal, or harder to see, or remove stealth wooosh noises.
---
He should obviously be balanced but it really doesn't make any logical sense the way his power is built.
---
I don‚Äôt think that using ‚Äúnew killer‚Äù as an argument makes much sense. A new killer would lose tons of chases with  any character no matter how good.
---
Ik ok. My friend doesn't :/ we tried fixing bugs, uninstalling and install, change WiFi, update console...nothing
---
Problem I have with him is that his shred is so easy to juke and you get so punished for missing it.
---
That doesn‚Äôt matter when he has better mobility and range than billy
---
NOED is a crutch perk for killers that already lost!
---
**has adrenaline, DS, and teammates with BT**
---
I have no sympathy, she had prayer beads.
---
I main her, it's hilarious to curbstomp cocky survivors. She's great to cut chases/loops short.
---
Is this shadman's style I see here?
---
Ok boomer
---
You don‚Äôt have to win every game to have fun. I play red ranks as killer and I still have fun with low tier killers. Seems like you only play the game to win and not to have fun. Maybe change your attitude instead of trying to get the devs to change the killers so you can win every game.
---
Since it doesn't actually affect your main game, they really need to change the PTB so it:  
---
A) Starts the new killer &amp; survivor at level 15 so you can try all three perks and  
---
B) Give all other survivors &amp; killers access to the new perks  
---
C) Give the characters a few map offerings to make it more likely to get new maps. This wouldn't really work great with the current PTB, since I assume the new map has the same offering.
---
This would allow people to actually test them without having to grind first. It's one thing to require grinding in the main game, but for a TEST server they should make it easier to access the things actually being tested.
---
$1 a tier.    The rift is about painful grind to drive sales.
---
If you watched the video he would literally disprove that, the flick at the end + 0 cooldown on canceling the charge means it can be used at any structure effectively.
---
Maybe because the killer just came out? It was like this with Demo too. People didn't know how to counter it and you'd constantly get 4k's in the ptb
---
Wat. No. Wrong application for that sub, homie.
---
This sounds like a toxic killer admitting he‚Äôs OP?
---
You say let us enjoy him before suggesting nerfs, suggesting he is, in fact, too strong and you wanna enjoy running train on the survivors ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Did you actually watch the video?
---
Why not?
---
That's amazingly well done!
---
Game has content come out every 3 months, mid chapter patch every month and a half, new battle pass just added as well as bigger updates and a roadmap that has been followed pretty well. No need to worry about the game dying anytime soon
---
He get sound AND visual queue point I the direction of the spotting survivor.
---
I always seem to be accidentally looking in GF's direction or cause the reveal noise to happen while trying to hide from him. And him then finding me because of that. :(
---
Someone forgot what a public test build is meant for. It's not for your enjoyment, it's to get feedback on the changes that are coming to the game. We are supposed to critique new killers/survivors and their perks to ensure that changes won't need to be made so soon after the release.
---
Maybe if you are the survivor lol!
---
Yeah I made a thread like this last week as well, except it was about Xbox, so it's not just you and not just PS4. I know Tru3tal3ent has been hyping him up a lot over the past month during his streams, so that's probably why Ghostface has seen such a big uptick.
---
Actually not! It‚Äôs my own style. It‚Äôs true I check shadman almost once a week, but I don‚Äôt think I ever got influenced by his style.
---
I haven‚Äôt played a lot of dbd,but isn‚Äôt the whole point of 1killerv4survivors that you shouldn‚Äôt be able to ‚Äò1v1‚Äô the killer?
---
Yes, Shred takes some getting used to,but you simply need to change the way you use it. 
---
It shines in loops, you can completely shut down longer loops like shack coming from the corner where the survivor cannot see you charging it and you know he is going for the window vault, you just shred them as they are starting the vault.  Any other L-shaped loops with vaults are very good as well. Tight corridors where they cannot dodge. Basically exploit parts of the map where you know they are locked in towards a certain object (like a vault) and they have to be looking forward in that moment. It also completely wrecks pallets, if a survivor is going for a pallet you either shred them if they are greedy, or they are forced to drop it and you shred it instantly, removing the need to be stunned and breaking it normally. 
---
Don't use it out in the open where the survivors can easily look behind and dodge you, exploit sight lines and loops. However, it's also great to fake it out in the open where you ready the shred and the survivor starts zigzagging trying to dodge it, losing speed and allowing you to just close in and hit them with a normal lunge. There is even an add-on that increases movement speed while readying shred.
---
The way I see it, looking at the second miss, the basic swing is a cone, and cones are larger at the ends, since you‚Äôre so close to the survivor and the center of your screen isn‚Äôt exactly on the survivor the cone doesn‚Äôt intersect with their capsule. Remember that the survivor hitbox doesn‚Äôt follow the back and forth leaning of the healing animation because that‚Äôs probably why the miss looks so questionable.
---
Such an exaggeration
---
Will you also suck a dick if you‚Äôre right?
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be canon, but Bill‚Äôs cameo in Payday: The Heist has a cool outfit.
---
Lmao that's so wrong
---
This is the reason I deleted the game today
---
Imagine doing 4 out of 5 totems thinking your teammates got the last one as you can't find it anywhere, just to have NOED during endgame. And found out the totem is in a bugged location. Feels bad
---
Negative
---
You forgot every forever Freddy perk and addon. Swf would just let the last person die on hook.
---
The AOE of the bat is super small bruh. Nerf it and it wont even be an AOE attack
---
It is not about effective man, it is about being inevitable and unfun to go against because there is nothing you as a survivor can do when it happens.
---
It's still juke able the same way Billy is. He can't do 360 turns
---
I personally would, I dont think it will die out for a while and it's only $20. I rather enjoy the game and think it's worth it.

---
Yea. Fun for the green ranks huh. Lot's of fun lol.
---
Fuck the devs
---
name: the showman
---
role: a calm minded wild card killer that mimics other killers with a sense of show
---
lore: once a normal human with a passion for show. he eventually ended in the entity's realm where the killing began. after the entity saw him as a candit and gave him a mix of show and a dash of power the show officially began: ''IT'S SHOWTIME LADIES AND GENTLEMAN!''
---
basic things:
---
height: tall
---
terror radius: none
---
speed: slower than tier 1 myers faster than a walking survivor
---
redstain: at all times
---
perks: calm minded: you stay calm during all times a rush job gives no emotion after all
---
every time you lose a chase your terror radius is increased by 1/3/5 meters total stacks: 5
---
''keep a calm mind show no sense of humanity, make the meat bleed'' -the Entity
---
Showtime: you put on the best show you can just to feed the entity emotion
---
every hit inflitcs deep wounds (timer does not go down so it can't down them but stops them from healing)
---
''THE SHOW MUST GO ON!'' -the showman
---
adaption: you adapt to the survivors tricks
---
after getting stuned by  a pallet you gain enduring, after getting flashlight blinded you get lightborn. after a survivor gets out you get agitation or iron grasp or mad grit. all depends on the level of the perk
---
''I LEARN FROM MY PAST PREFORMANCE!'' -the showman
---
power addons: the dvd series: powerr regenerates faster (goes up to purple rarity with varing speeds)
---
the shownotes: modiefies powers to last longer
---
hunting season: yellow addons: slipery boots: you can vault things but you can't use game show
---
rusty knife: removes the deep wounds timer and inflicts normal wounds
---
green addons for the sandman: spiked drink: survivors fall asleep faster (can't use hunting season)
---
''magic towl'': survivors hit while in the dream world will be hit with the oblivios status
---
purple addons for game show: stolen designe: timers on the trap will explode after 2 minutes instead of 3 (can't use sandman)
---
dead battery's: only one trap is actually functional and will explode when a generator is completed (instant death but only one trap shows up)
---
pink addons: Showmans magic mirror: scratched mirror myers but faster (also no showmans tallent)
---
''fans'' Rose: you can't use showmans tallent anymore but all survivors gain the exposed status and you get standerd killer aspects (-speed wich you still lack)
---
Power: showmans tallent
---
1 of 3 things will happen when activated  out side of this power you are basicly a tier 1 myers
---
1: hunting season: you go into a frenzy that can't inflict real wounds due to not thinking straight the entity has taken over (legions frenzy but without the miss hit your out thing also you can't vault without a addon)
---
2: the sandman, you are a fear in their minds (think pre rework freddy but no need to pull them in that gets done automaticly, no terror radius while ''awake'')
---
3: game show: all survivors gain a trap on their head that will explode after 3 minutes (won't go off during a chase timer just stops) and a jigsaw box apears on the map wich holds a key to their freedom (think jigsaws baptisme + alarm clocks)
---
''ENCORE!''
---
Anyone else find this stuff just...creepy gross?
---

Yeah I expect that this game will have content coming out for at least a couple more years. If you truly enjoy it i'd say buy it.
---
Both Zubat and Otz are better killers than Jund, and arguably less biased. They both also give better arguments on what nerf Oni needs. Removing (or hindering) his ability to strafe while demon dashing and leaving other things untouched would be good for him. And it would help survivors be less likely to screech. As unlikely as that is. 
---
But that being said, if Oni is "uncounterable" then the two killers he apes (Myers and Billy) must be unstoppable as well. Especially since Billy can chainsaw whenever he wants, and Myers doesn't have to hit people to get to tier 3. And his lunge is longer than Oni's. And it doesn't block 80% of his screen. And he doesn't lose Tier 3 from picking up survivors. Anyways. Just gett on the PTB and play Oni for yourselves. The only people dominating with him are people who are already red rank killers anyways, and can dominate with the fucking Trapper.
---
They are not, just like Moris aren't
---
You mean Unbreakable? You could technically do that with No Mither.
---
They removed the charge time addons which was game changing
---
Why is Yui's nose is so weird tho...
---
Every survivor be like:
---
Unless you juke him as he can't turn 360 degrees and the hitbox isn't wide, it's long. He's literally beaten the same way Billy is.
---
Your also forgetting he's a killer with no power until he gets to that point
---
And gave him one of his iridescent add ons by default.
---
Very lost in the sauce. Can you explain what the perk is and how it makes legion 'good' again?
---
I see people saying the oni is strong but all i see is people trying to do is typical chases. He is a new killer who has'nt been out that long, maybe people should try different techniques or ideas before jumping to nerf?
---
...wait. You guys get Mori dailies?
---
now this is podracing
---
Idk why the devs decided to design a killer around slugging that‚Äôs just actually baffling to me
---
Yikes
---
Americans get it for just $20?! It's $39 in the UK!
---
All the GF I play against on ps4 don't even stalk they just m1, and use there power in chases to hide the TR. This is at like rank 1-5 btw.
---
I knew these were coming. I hope they keep as is.
---
You're still limited in how many you can trade per week for BP and it takes a long time to get enough shards to do the 4x trade you're aiming for when a new DLC releases.
---
They really need to raise the BP cap to 2 million, increase BP gain across the board and reduce Shrine perks to 1k iris so you can actually be competitive as a killer without blowing your ability to get free cosmetics.
---
I don't understand the surv mindset. "We're tired of facing the same 3 killers every game!!!!!
---
When the devs actually introduce a good killer that can add more variety into their games: " THIS KILLER IS SO OP NERF NERF NERF NERF!!!!!! "
---
Why?
---
Wait for the Black Friday sale, it is going to be 50 percent off.
---
How dare people make suggestions for change on a Public Test Build
---
I want my bill cosmetics!

I'm an idiot.

I'm down for a presidential survivor tbh

https://undeadwalking.com/2017/10/14/dead-by-daylight-interview-mathieu-cote/
---
and heres a quote for making it easier for you 
---
&gt;because we tapped so much into what I believe makes the old 70s/80s slasher films really good is that tension. Tension that builds up the anticipation of the violence more than display of itself, means you get those really intense moments of pure stress while playing the game. That never goes away because it‚Äôs based upon rules that we put in to make sure there‚Äôs always uncertainty.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs a throwback to 70s/80s slashers with distrust of friends and strangers abound.
---
and also this quote from m. Cote which can be said in support of NOED
---
&gt;The initial core idea was always finding a way to play the villain! We wanted to give you the opportunity to the bad guy and be really, really bad. And see the effect of what you‚Äôre doing.
---
Kate is my main, she will always be my main. I do love the look of Yui, so it‚Äôs safe to say she will be played frequently as well. Unless she gets an annoying voice actor. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I can‚Äôt play with Jane too often. Iron will is a must for her!
---
Yeah, I know, they are using TrueTalent‚Äôs build, which is really strong.
---
ABSOLUTLY
---
unless they all gang up on him then i honestly don't know i mean it's a big old 1 vs what 19?
---
&gt; No Easter Bunny
---
&gt;No bunny
---
Huntress would like a wordless scream.
---
Does it really matter?
---
Well, a deal is a deal. Mukagas where are you?
---
Or you know, not be alseep then it works fine?
---
What do you mean; this game is hella fun solo
---
If you‚Äôre not ok with having a lot of toxic games then yeah, but it can still be fun to play solo if you can handle the toxicity.
---
I want this too.
---
Please do. This is an amazing idea.
---
Billy and freddy tier imo
---
It‚Äôs not going to happen until the end of their year 4 roadmap labeled as ‚Äúrank rework ‚Äòinitiatives‚Äô‚Äù is what I believe.
---
No its really not, nerfing would increase skill cap without being  a drastic nerf. It's currently way too easy to use.
---
I really don't get the hate this sub has against ttvs
---
I never got a ttv that was toxic or unwilling to play the game
---
And if after the match I stop by to say hi on the stream they are usually really nice people too
---
Consider yourself lucky then. Xbox player here and idk how the glitch activated but had a Claudette running fast af. Couldn't even catch up to her with spirit.
---
WHERE IS MUKAGAS?
---
I agree that keys are bs. I mostly play killer and feel like keys should be an item not found in bloodwebs and make them not collectable. Make them a chest drop you can‚Äôt take out of the trial or the entity destroys it. Maybe keep broken keys as a item but change what they actually are.
---
Well. he's fucked...
---
We do care about bloodpoints thank you very much
---
Can someone lmk what those add-ons do? I don‚Äôt play dbd much.
---
That was the plan all along
---
It‚Äôs ¬£14.99
---
Steam usually has great refund policy right after you buy it, just request one and they should give you your money back soon.
---
The original post was a joke. This was posted when The Oni teaser was posted. Anyways, a deal is a deal.
---
Is that because of the sale? I bought it early this morning for ¬£29.99 haha
---
Because people click ghost face, then play.
---
give it a couple seasons though. it won‚Äôt take a miracle for horrible players to make and maintain red ranks season after season. with the emblem changes it‚Äôs almost as easy as the old BP system to pip up anymore. the reworked pipping requirements didn‚Äôt do much to alleviate that since they keep adding events that give emblem progress. i think the net result is more players in red ranks after a few seasons overall.
---
It‚Äôs always been ¬£14.99 on PC, since release
---
Someone DCd...
---
I wouldn't be TOO proud of this victory.
---
I‚Äôm here dude. Prepare for the suck
---
Unfortunately I bought it from Sony since I play console, and they don't really do refunds! But thank you!
---
Letter and ruleset are broken af lmao
---
ü§°ü§°ü§°üôè
---
Lmao, maybe next chapter :P
---
But you're capped at a million, and if you play any killer other than Spirit, Nurse, Billy or MAYBE Huntress you're constantly spending BP for more addons since most are reliant on them to be functional (especially Trapper, Doctor, Wraith, Freddy etc).
---
Cap needs to go back up to at least 2 million so you can actually functionally play new DLC killers/survivors on day one. Whatever happened to that crafting system they had demo'd in the PTB at one point where you can exchange certain addons for better ones or BP? Think they called it the Blood Market? I know they have something like that on mobile DBD.
---
Yes, you can be the villain. Yes, it‚Äôs slasher INSPIRED. That does not make it a slasher game in the slightest. In a slasher game you would practically guarantee that 2/3 or the survivors die and the last one escapes because that‚Äôs a common trope as well. Should we just murder 3 survivors while they‚Äôre walking out of the gate too to fit that trope?
---
Ah, I play console! It's ¬£29.99 on there haha
---
ü§î...
---
ü§£
---
I'm hooked on the no TR. At the beginning of the match I hit as many as I can then I use my nurses calling to sneak back up on them. If you have ruin up while you start the beginning hitting everyone then they are under to much pressure to find it. That's why I like GF. He is the only killer I can keep ruin up with and NC is way over powered on him.  I get lots of 4ks with him. I think he is the most underated killer in the game.  Yes he can be looped but if you keep everyone injured then use nurses survivors start to panic. I also get 1 or 2 people exposed. I run  Ruin,BBQ, NC and DL. Like I said keep up never letting them heal safely and drop Chase's to insure that you are always hurting someone. Then start downing and hooking and DL stacks start to hit and I keep them to busy to get ruin. Works 80% of the games.
---
I mean... other people want to be able to have fun too when he is released. Also, as others have said, PTB is *supposed* to be for testing and suggestions.
---
At least we in this version it is specific to hitting legion with a pallet.  Just means that if you are playing against them that you have to be mindful of using pallets.  Wait till they have used their ability and it has expired.
---
&gt;Or you know, not be alseep then it works fine?
---
* Passive sleep.
---
* Add-ons that prevent you from waking up through failed skill check.
---
* Freddy hitting the survivor with Endurance and putting him to sleep. 
---
The list is probably bigger but I am too lazy to think about it right now.
---
Well look who was 110% wrong? Lmao
---
Okay but forcing slug play is a fun experience for both
---
Uh, impossible huh? I'm already done with Page 2 and it's been out for a little more than a week.
---
Nah bro, don‚Äôt chicken out now
---
How many patches have survivors have things taken away again
---
u/Mukagas
---
Yeah but it's a ton harder to rank up as survivor. This system would be great for encouraging killer mains to sit through that queue so they can get easy points. Hard to find fun killers now because only the really sweaty ones wait in the queue.
---
g o d d a m m i t
---
Passive sleep that takes 60 seconds.
---
Then use the clock you dummy.
---
Yes because 60 second timer
---
What is a TTV again?
---
Which video? The most optimal build video or the best build against spotters video?  Both are are month old...  which is everyone using?
---
The game is really fun solo, unless you're someone who thinks winning is more important than having fun.
---
They're not mad at that.  Theyre mad that they aren't on the PTB and they want to experience the OP killer before the incoming nerf.
---
You do understand the original post was a joke right? It was posted when the Oni teaser was posted. But, I do have a dick to suck
---
Oh wow yes call the people complaining that they got a completly unfun match and just wasted their time bitches, that's what they are 100%
---
I never get tired of looking at Maya Hawke but this one even did away with that positive. :(
---
swift hunt blood = tremendously reduces reappearance time
---
windstorm blood = tremendously increases movement speed while cloaked, slightly decreases while uncloaking
---
Dude what are you a moron??
---
Even by Devs standard 2 kill 2 escape is standard
---
And they have a perk for the gate scenario you mentioned, Blood Warden. 
---
Now just shut the fuck up and stop embarassing yourself.
---
I said this sooooo long ago like wtf why is there 0 absolutely 0 reason for ranking up and keeping it at the end of the season like wtf??? Why is there no rewards?? The only thing we get is super sweaty survivors or killers what reward is that??
---
What do you mean pick jason?  You mean choose to play as killer or survivor like dbd does?
---
My friend, you just got wooshed
---
Ah maybe because you're not red ranks yeah I don't know. But at least I know that almost every games there are pallets that I don't break, otherwise I'd lose too much time. Especially unsafe pallets. Even if you just run after downing a pallet they almost break it everytime ?
---
They dc‚Äôd on their last hook anyways
---
I mean, are they really? The current letter guts a whole part of her kit by giving her one trap that hardly does it job of wasting time since there‚Äôs only two boxes to search and the aura reading range is weak for what the add-on does. It‚Äôs a very Niche add-on for an ultra rare. The current rule set does nothing when traps get activated and even then RBT‚Äôs in general pose little threat without stacked add-ons that reduce the death timer, increase search time or add more boxes. Starting with traps on the head wouldn‚Äôt be an immediate threat until a gen gets completed and at that point it acts like it‚Äôs own corrupt intervention. Effectiveness also dependant on how fast or slow people remove their traps. 
---
This is the problem with things written on paper, they can sound broken but in practise be totally fine. It‚Äôs a reason a lot of the add-ons the devs create (not all) lack creativity or strength, because they‚Äôre afraid of things being too strong. Well, that‚Äôs what PTB‚Äôs are for, testing those kinds of things out and adjusting accordingly.
---
Oh no, I have a dick to suck and I got wooshed? Things are not going well for me
---
Forever Freddy supposed to have at least ruin and PGTW, and most likely also has dying light, BBQ or surveillance for control. Swing chains and jump rope are signature add-ons that make all progress feel like forever.
---
There is plenty of ways to counter him lockers for one. He can't cancel his attack so he will always miss
---
Two, people say it's unjukeablw so is Billy unjukeable too? No he can't make 360 turns and it a hitbox is not wide.
---
Expect him to slug thus you can play around slugging.
---
Don't even let him get his power in the first place
---
Do we know the rarity of all the outfits yet?
---
Yeah I want it to be harder. But on the other hand   then it will be longer queue times again. This whole system sucks.
---
Joey likes rap and it‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs black. The slang they used literally points us to it. I‚Äôve never heard a rock dude say man that was a banger. It also talks about beats yea, Joey kills to rap.
---
Oh ok
---
What's your playstyle?
---
If they want to do cosmetic rewards, they should reset every 3 to 6 months instead of every month to make the cosmetic more valuable. That way skins and trinkets aren't a dime a dozen thing. Or they can give a small amount of auric cells every season. They can also create a new season reward currency like Overwatch - get enough and get a special skin for a character of your choice or a cool trinket.
---
Incorrect. The last killer that was needed was plague, every other killer was actually buffed, not nerfed.
---
Honestly I would but dlc killers because the rest can be bought with shards
---
You say that like you believe that survivors didn‚Äôt deserve the nerfs?
---
&gt; Passive sleep that takes 60 seconds.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Then use the clock you dummy.
---
&gt; Yes because 60 second timer
---
Use the clock that is across the map while going for a save. Genius.
---
I, myself, find it pretty creepy gross.
---
‚ÄúDeleted‚Äù lmao
---
it‚Äôs a catch-22 right? on the one hand shorter queue times but the quality of games goes down,  but on the other hand insane queue times with the possibility of getting a good and balanced match. or as balanced as bhvr can manage lol
---
Good luck
---
Yeah, a perk to do that. The thing is, you need to actually do something for that perk to activate other than suck at the game. 2 kills 2 escapes may be standard, but that doesn‚Äôt mean every match should play out that way. Most people agree with my that NOED is a safety net and should be tweaked. It would be alright with me if you had to hook every survivor once and get extra bonuses, but as it is it rewards players being bad at that game and needs to be changed.
---
Besides the fact not every Freddy camps and if you realy on borrowed time to save I think you need to leern how to save. He can't hit you all at once.
---
A lot of people mistakenly think that this game is competitive Esports, which is not true, this is why they have a mindset that everything that even slightly resembles a better-than-normal killer/perk/mechanic/*insert your own example*, they propose nerfs and don't allow others have fun with their **optimal** playstyle. Because fun is not allowed in this game I guess.
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
Idk which video, but the build is Thana, slopy, ruin and nurses.
---
Finding a slugged Ace is like searching for a needle in an acestack.
---
I seem to accidentally reveal ghost face more than I do intentionally. It‚Äôs almost like when I‚Äôm actually trying to reveal him to save myself or someone else from being exposed, it just completely doesn‚Äôt work.
---
What are his perks?
---
It's not that the killer is OP. I want strong killers in the game, but I also want to have fun going against them. I want to feel like I have a chance of escaping, otherwise, what is the point of playing as survivor? Once the Oni gets his power, you're basically fucked at loops and many of the tiles. Have you seen how he can 180 around corners with his charge? He has better turning than Billy with add-ons, without any add-ons of his own. If one killer is super strong and clearly is better than all the other killers, why would killers choose to play any other killer? They'll be doing themselves a disservice by not playing the killer with the greatest chance of a 4k, so instead of 3-4 "viable" killers, we will have everyone playing the same killer every match.
---
Forever Freddy... Is bullshit.
---
No killer should have addons that make doing gens so fucking slow. Especially since there's already perks that do that.
---
I enjoy an aggressive playstyle, but have trouble maintaining pressure. I love Ghostface, but he‚Äôs an all/nothing with me. I‚Äôve been enjoying Freddy a lot for his mobility and pressure, and I‚Äôm going to start Billy soon.
---
I often run something like BBQ, pop, ruin, and Discordance/SBTFL/Whispers
---
Just to reply to your edit, you clearly aren't reading the conversation.
---
Nobody is saying he is overpowered. Nobody is saying he should be nerfed. Nobody is saying he is overperforming.
---
People are downvoting you because you are being an asshole and demonstrating your ability to not read anything before jumping to conclusions.
---
Pardon, but which are those?
---
Nobody is going to pay cells or shards for something straight out of the Walmart graphic tee aisle.
---
I understand why people think tunnelling is the most efficient thing to do. Surely in theory more hooks in quick succession = quick kills is the best way to play, but against good survivors it really isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll try and explain why without rambling too much: 
---
1. Killer has hooked survivor A. Survivor B, C and D are working on separate gens. 
---
2. Survivor B unhooks A, 50/50 chance on whether they complete the heal on Survivor A.
---
3. While B unhooks A, killer locates C and chases them. B either heals A or goes back to gen. 
---
4. After A is unhooked, killer leaves C and returns to hook. Locates A, chases and downs them again. How long this takes depends on health state and perks like DS/BT. 
---
5. Immediately after the killer abandons C, they go back to the gen they were on, or to another gen if that gen is completed. D has completed their first gen and are onto their second. 
---
Obviously there are a lot of variables here, but this basic scenario will happen again until A dies, usually by then the gates will be either powered or open. The problem is that the killer is leaving at least half the survivor team to complete gens without distraction. Yes, the killers job is the kill, but they also have to pressure the other players. Against good survivors the gens will be completed quickly, perks like decisive and borrowed time will add time that it takes for the killer to chase the survivor they‚Äôre tunnelling. The counter side to this scenario is that the huge majority of survivors are one of two things: solo survivors so not in comms, or simply bad and don‚Äôt realise when to do gens and when to save. Which is why you can often tunnel your way to a 4k until you get to like rank 6-8ish.
---
Actually I can't just pull a Mori out of a chest and use it on the middle of a trial, so keys are arguably worse.
---
Literally happened to me last night BTW on a game I completely was stomping with Freddy.
---
We know this. I love running tenacity on him and immediately disappearing into the grass after getting downed. Cracks me up every time.
---
* Anyone who blinds, pallet stuns, or Head Ons the killer becomes the killer's new Obsession, and becomes Oblivious for 60 seconds.
---
* Oblivious means you have no Terror Radius. 
---
* Legion's Deep Wound timer goes down if you're outside their Terror Radius.
---
The combination means Legion baits a survivor into feeding them a pallet slam, enters Feral Frenzy, hits the survivor, and then chases them until they bleed out.
---
When you use Legion's add-ons then you can make this happen even faster.
---
People refer to it as "Old Legion" because the original Legion could keep hitting you in Feral Frenzy until you fell over. This new build can do more-or-less the same thing, but only needs to hit you once.
---
It is comparable to a Furtive Chase build, except Furtive Chase takes forever to build stacks on.
---
Yes you are 100% in the wrong.
---
What does cap have anything to do with what I said?
---
keep whining
---
"I will never. Stop. Killing you."
---
1) I don‚Äôt the OoO is in a good place right now either, killers don‚Äôt have perks that work against them against certain survivors so why should survs? Balance is equality you know? Yes there‚Äôs a risk of a totem going early but that just leaves you perkless it doesn‚Äôt outright turn your perk against you. 
---
2) If you say that the only way to combat this mechanic is to not stun the killer then yes that is removing the stun mechanic from that match because you either don‚Äôt stun or you die in an inevitable timer. Spirit fury doesn‚Äôt happen every stun making it not on the same level (I still find spirit fury to be a cheese perk to run as it essentially gives a cheap hit but it‚Äôs not exactly overpowered in the way this is). Haunted grounds is temporary and only goes off once so is also not comparable.
---
If you can loop then you will be fine against him
---
Perfect for DS users.
---
Yeah literally any killer that ever comes out, and every time they get a rework they are considered OP. People dont fucking know what over powered means. No killer that has been added is over powered godamn it. People thought clown was op when he came out
---
Demogorgon for a cute flesh eating creature, spirit for instant dc, legion for instant dc, Pig for oink, and ghostface for #selfie
---
well, my favorite killer is plague so you might be getting some bias but.. she‚Äôs a lot of fun. it‚Äôs terrifying to know that you‚Äôre either a one-shot or an easy down and altruistic actions will just end up in the disease spreading. she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of the sneakiness when it comes to how visible she is but it‚Äôs pretty scary just hearing the corrupt purge sound. it‚Äôs really up to you, demo has more of the surprise/mobility if you favor that.
---
If they really want to nerf him. Make him it take more blood for his power. Or less time for his power. Its a little similary to michael miyer but he need blood and not stalk for feed his power. But he have more speed like billy , can do area damage like leatherface, he can one shoot survivor like michael. And he will be strong like a spirit. And because of his power, he can see blood trail ez with the blood bubble, yes i name it like this, if you try to brain him with grass. He will see a red bubble and another one. So its time to hard counter. David i choose you, david use no mither, every survivor use david with no mither, dammit its the nurse with tanatophobie and dying light with a ruin and bbq chili. And now we died and nobody take no mither and its the oni and we died, again, and now i return to dbd but on roblox.
---
Red/purple rank PS4, least are def pig clown and doctor
---
Why would anyone want this?
---
His power is strong but not busted if you can loop then you will be fine this killer is all about placement where you are on the map when you hear him go demon get to a loop as you will be screwed if you are caught out in the open
---
Killer with WALL power when?
---
Ugh, just suck on a pig dick or something. It‚Äôs the most civil you can be.
---
No, you're not.
---
Every game theres 4 tool boxes and they don't care about anything but gens:
---
Someone with Twitch.tv in their name
---
First pst that took longer than expeted
---
Well, that is canonically what he wore going into surgery. That‚Äôs also what he always wears, in addition to his jacket and beret.
---
Pretty sure that anything that makes legion a viable killer(even if he is a cunty one), the community wants nerfed as far as I have seen. So instead of neRfFiNg Legion, maybe rework them to have different abilities based on who you pick to make them more interesting instead of just an excuse to put lots of cosmetics into the game.
---
The bloodpoints alone should be a thing when the season ends. That would really improve the game in my opinion as well as give people something to look forward to the better they get.
---
You don't listen to Death Metal to chillax. Joey 100% listens to hip hop.
---
I get this is a joke but who tf uses those flashlight add ons
---
Spawns a wall in front of you like anivia from league
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea of being rewarded for everything but this does seem to make a lot of sense!
---
Oh no...
---
I think it would just make people even more toxic about losing like in Overwatch with the gold guns
---
*epidemic
---
Who says you have to do it? Join the good side so we can protect you!
---
They have already stated they want to change rank system and offer rank rewards, they just got to figure out how and implement it. Survivors are essentially skins but killer's aren't you could be amazing with billy but be an absolute shitter nurse so killer rank should be individual but then what to do with survivor my guess be just leave it all one rank for survivor.Then when doing rank rewards on killer side just hand out the reward based on their highest rank
---
I had done it that way for it's other effects to be stronger with each safe unhook, since each token increases your unhooking speed by 5/7/10% and the unhooked survivor is healed by 5/10/15% for each token, as well as having the ability to unhook yourself during the struggle phase
---
Superblind is a rare alternative to double battery addons. IME it‚Äôs like the Holy Roman Empire to Rome but Rome is the instablind.
---
This needs to be a thing, there‚Äôs no reason to rank up in reality. Higher rank survivors make killer entirely unfun to play. And it just makes queue times longer. At least give BP depending on rank.
---
I think Ebony Mori needs to be changed. Make it so you can kill before hooking but make it one survivor only. That way it bypasses 3 hooks instead of 8. 
---
Also being Mori'd shouldn't completely kill your Unbroken emblem since the killer "cheated" to get you out of the round.
---
Why does he look like he's about to floss
---
Plot twist, Carrylizard is a girl and she knew this was a win-win situation for her. Either get Pennywise in DBD or suck dick.
---
Why? It's just basic math to determine your rate of completion
---
but wouldn‚Äôt that like kill ur battery in like half a second
---
Yeah I currently use an Ethernet cable for that exact reason lol
---
Is part of the comic cut off or are we supposed to interpret what the oni did to feng‚Äôs face as vengeance?
---
 I would never play this mode as a survivor-I‚Äôd be moried every match! Hell nooo.
---
As someone already said, Julie definitely listens to Joy Division. Joey definitely chills to 90's hip hop. Frank? Distortions and loud percussions reminda me of either drum and bass or  electronica. I honestly have no clue what Susie listens to. And the entity mixtape is probably -**UNFATHOMABLE SCREAMS OF THE DAMNED**- or like, black metal maybe.
---
I think he's fine he plays like Billy but with more burst power which is balanced by the limited timer the only change that needs to be made is the turnaround on end of demon rush that allows him to flick to survivor really easy
---
Man I really want to have friends that play this game to prove this
---
Right???
---
So the deep wound timer only goes down when you are not inside the legion's terror radius.  Nemesis removes his terror radius when he gets stunned, so he can keep chasing you and either he is going to catch up and hit you or you bleed out and go down anyway.  There is no escape from that.
---
dunno the only fun thing I like about the clown is his attack animation with save the best

Don‚Äôt be a coward OP. Give us the sauce. I know the ending is good lol.
---
Oh it‚Äôs your art! Lol Good stuff.
---
Most pros put her as the 5-7th best spot
---
r/unexpecteddeadpool ?
---
no dont nerf oni he's perfect in his current state
---
Thanks bro&lt;3
---
I was playing a game 2 days ago and about 10 seconds into the match someone throws down a pallet and vaults it a ton, obviously trying to get my attention.
---
Well it's a claudette and a nea (claudette was the one vaulting the pallet, obviously trying to sandbag nea for whatever reason)
---
Well I start to chase the claudette and she is not good. So nea is also running away alongside the claudette, nea vaults a window causing the claudette to be unable to vault it. 
---
So being the completely reasonable person the claudette is, she DCs. But that's not all! She stays until the end of the game just to say "I dc'd because nea bodyblocked me" as if she didnt just sandbag the nea. These people dont have a brain I swear
---
THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT FOR BIKER KATE
---
Is this implying Flashlight is at all OP?
---
First outfits are basic commons/uncommons. Second outfits will probably be rare, the 3rd and 4th outfits will probably be very rare, one available on release and the other coming out a few weeks from now.
---
Just my guesses.
---
Aggression and easy to play. He feels really different to any other killer as he is a monster.
---
Yeah a lotta people having issues. Not just you. Hopefully they fix it for you soon.
---
I hope she tastes equally delicious.. although eating her would be quite different from how I eat baby goats.
---
gotta hear steves femboy moans
---
*Yare yare daze'
---
maybe, but this is a known glitch that happens with all exhaustion perks, there were some patchnotes referring this. i also had this happen with me a few weeks ago, even posted about it here
---
- the killer is lower rank
---
- they have thrill of the hunt but every other totem is dull
---
- they‚Äôre a killer with a special attack but run at you with a basic attack
---
- they start camping a certain survivor instead of patrolling the exit gates, though this is pretty common anyways
---
- they are a weaker killer and don‚Äôt appear to have any good add-ons
---
good luck! to counter this i‚Äôd say just cleanse every totem you come across, but if it gets bad you could consider bringing a rainbow map or the perk ‚Äúsmall game‚Äù until you get to a rank in which you find that killers have abandoned it. i‚Äôm not hating on new killers by the way, i‚Äôm just speaking from experience!
---
Motorcycle accident couple years back
---
the solution isn't to change legion right now. The deep wound system needs to be changed, because nemesis also counters BT.
---
Might as well just scratch off Claudette - I just had a few in the Lesser Yamaoka map. I think. I don't know if they were actually there.
---
Ifs useless because it doesn‚Äôt work half the time. The perk it‚Äôs self is fine. And it doesn‚Äôt matter for me. I can extendo armed all the time using dh.
---
If you like to run STBLF and BBQ, go for Demogorgon, you can use his portals perfect with BBQ, and you won‚Äòt lose STBLF tokens when hitting the obsession with shred
---
was just thinking about that episode and wondered if anyone else was thinking about it as well
---
Being survivor/killer sided doesn‚Äôt make your points any less/more valid.  
---
Why exactly do  you think Scott doesn‚Äôt have any good input. I wouldn‚Äôt call you a fanboy if you had more to say than ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just whining‚Äù.  
---
I‚Äôll give you my 2 cents: whenever I play against spirit it‚Äôs literally a guessing game, a coinflip, when she‚Äôs phasewalking. Sure, killers should have the upper hand in a 1v1, but as a survivor there‚Äôs no feedback. Just hope for the best. Especially without iron will.
---
Ohh, I had no idea! Thanks!
---
Dead Hard is terrible, #1 exhaustion perk my ass just don't fucking lunge lmao.
---
Nobody asked
---
AoE means Area of Effect. You use the attack and it down everyone within a tiny area. Its like lunging, but it effects everyone withing that area instead of 1 person. There's nothing skillfull aboit that.
---
A new one.
---
In the video he literally says "I have no idea if Oni is OP, he's like the spirit, they can totally lose a game against good survivors" He is only stating that like spirit, he takes full control during a chase
---
Only if you escape the killers grasp. I still don‚Äôt see points for wiggle progression when you‚Äôre hooked
---
Idk I watch a little bit of everything but mostly gameplay
---
I said yes because when you are new, you will learn the game and that the most magical moment in this game you will play relax, it will not be competitif you will learn how to do skill check, you will fail skill check, you will hide in locker, you will be find in locker, you will win the chase, you will lose the chase. And you will learn in that game, try to play with your friend if you want to survive on the first hook because rank 20 will be like. Oh no he his on the hook. I will continous generator for don't have any point on altruism, he will think it better like this because he think he will died if he come to save you so he continous to think i should finish generator for escape, i don't care about other but when he will be hook, he will think why nobody help me, the last survivor is you and you escape without this toxic teamate with the hatch. You will become a good player survivor than killer, you will be the most fair player in the world, you will not be salty and be like everytime gg and they said you are cancer but they try to gen rush, you will become better that noob3 and monto. You will be red rank 1 survivor killer. You will have every survivor and killer prestige 3 lvl50. So you will start your new youtube channel, you will have 2 164 964 266 subscriber, you will start to streaming. And you will become a legend in dbd, and now you will remember this question on dbd and be like thank reddit because you are rich popular and you will play quentin with the perk wake up and realise that was your imagination when you read this stream and you will be like. That it, im getting dbd. And you lost 5 min of your time for read this comment because help me i can't stop write what i am thinking so i will stop this now before it to late and NOBODY WILL BE ABLE TO READ EVERYTHING on this comment because it to long. Anyway its getting weird.
---
Buy dbd.=)
---
I'd make it tokens from getting pallet smacked. Call it "Never Again" or something: Each time you get stunned by a pallet, gain a token. You may spend 4/3/2 tokens to break one undropped pallet.
---
But what I'd really like to see is pallet blocking added to Cruel Limits. If they did that, maybe it wouldn't be complete trash. Well, they'd probably have to make it last longer... I'd actually like to see it made permanent. Ok, sounds a bit extreme, but hear me out: Once a generator is done, that area loses strategic significance anyway. Blocking things in that area wouldn't actually impede Survivors THAT much, but it would gradually increase pressure on them by creating a sense of a shrinking field of play (sort of like Fortnite, I guess). It could maybe even be made a Hex perk to balance it out.

---
right? god most of the people here are just bitching without actually watching it
---
Oni sprint isn't infinite, but being able to run near/into stuff without a stun seems like an enormous advantage. It's not infinite, but watching some streamers it seems like it's much more useful in navigating cluttered maps.
---
Sure, the playstyle will be similar, but he seems like he'll be more successful getting across maps to touch that Discordance/Surveillance gen, and will be far better prepared to do something while he's there.
---
Working as a team , you wont win a chase with her as easily as other killers - if you are good enough you can try mindgames at pallets and windows
---
People just like to root for an underdog. Back when Legion was basically Sonic the Stab-hog, Freddy was the underpowered pity magnet. Now that The Nightmare is actually competitive Legion is the bottom of the barrel, and all the people who renamed themselves "Legion = DC" when they came out are the ones howling about the recent round of nerfs.
---
I wish people would give BHVR more credit. They are probably well aware what the perk changes will do for our teenage troublemaker crew, and the posted nerfs aren't intended to be taken in a vacuum but with the other changes in mind. That being said, the fact that the nerfs were leaked before the Oni perks probably didn't help the matter any.
---
Imo it depends on Yui's injured voice. The only downside for Feng is her volume and pitch while crying "üò≠Whhahhhh... OOooo... OOOOO HOOOO....üò≠" yes iron will is a thing but I don't always want to bring it.

I've dead ass had killers imply in post game that we should let them kill us as it's their job ??? And that if we, regardless of any semi precious offering we used etc, have outplayed them should accept them tunnelling and camping us as penance and just peace out and go to the next game
---
I call them Demo Lovato
---
Give ‚ÄúFungoose‚Äù a try. He is very entertaining and educational
---
Oni arguably has less stun for missing a blood fury M1
---
I'm rank 12, so yeah, it's still "try and error" for me. 
---
(I hate playing against the doc... all this screaming makes me jumpy)
---
Thanks!
---
No. You can't. It still has a dealy and is slow
---
Yeah, even in PTB, first match had 3 DCs. Waited 15 minutes for that game, downed 1 guy and then a tidal wave of DCs afterwards.
---
I beg to differ. Spirit can end a chase pretty fast. At least, faster than an M1 killer. And isn‚Äôt working as a team just kind of something you should do against *all* killers? I play killer almost exclusively, but I‚Äôm failing to see how that can be a counter.
---
Only 2 gens have to be completed for the key to be used. That's about 1 chase depending on the map/skill of the survivor being chased. So in the time that it could take for the killer to find and hook 1 survivor, the rest of the team can escape and win the game. That's balanced?
---
Spirit, then Legion.
---
Iridescent words OP
---
if they have lightborn that almost no one uses, then your flashlight is worthless no matter what you want to use it for
---
What rank are you? Also in my opinion he's one of the top 3 killers at the moment on console so maybe that's why.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs definitely the most popular killer on PS4 atm. I don‚Äôt mind though personally, I find him less of a pain in the ass than Spirit and healing builds are especially good against him.
---
As I said, the orbs are already there, just waiting to be picked up.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
that video has a glaring mistake though. The whole scenario that he and tofu tested could be avoided if tofu had just dropped the palle that was right next to tofu earlier.
---
Yeah, pretty much. Every so often they might not but almost every time they either break it right then and there or go back and break it after they down me or lose a chase with me. There‚Äôs definitely a window between those two to put the pallet back up but I‚Äôm 100% solo so none of my teammates would do that unless they were right by the pallet when I threw it down.
---
The killer is actually multiple teenage spree killers who use a knife.
---
Have you seen the original Scream movie?
---
It removes his terror radius.
---
Meaning that you can chase people and have the timer continue to go down.
---
he is not balanced and not overpowered too. he is just like spirit IMO
---
But how can I genrush and rely on adrenaline when I have to actually waste time healllllliiiinnngggg?
---
Could just be from nam, but there's also a helicopter you have to get to to escape in L4D that this looks like as well
---
but then you would have no pallets, and you would fight a killer that can hit people multiple times faster that other killers and still after his power is gone you would fight a 115% movement speed killer with no pallets and probably injured.
---
yes you can, you dont need to charge up the dash to do a strike, 
---
you can almost immediately strike, just hold the attack till his hands glow red(takes like a second).
---
The time between coming out of a dash and being able to hit is so minimal
---

---
oh thats sounds fun
---
The incentive is BP, not screwing over your team (survivor is a team effort and losing just one player could drastically change the outcome of the game), and xp for shards. There needs to be a punishment for dc‚Äôing.
---
On console: Nurse I haven't seen one as survivor in months. I play nurse every once in a while and it's crazy how console survivors don't know how to play against her.
---
That true and can you tell what the fck ghost face is doing with noed if he can already put in dying stats. Im a small game player so he lost it and i save the world. Only noob ghostface have noed. I can understant if the killer cannot put exposed stats to survivor because it take more time but a michael miyer is the worst for have noed.
---
When I heard nerf i was mad af. Then i saw the shitpost tag., Thank god. Oni is just a watered down Billy. IF oni will get nerfed, Billy has to get nerfed first because Billy is a little more than Oni. The only difference is stun after hitting something and theres actually a cooldown after getting rewarded by injuring someone.
---
Even with my (still) limited knowledge I can manage to recognize Ruin. Thanks a lot! I'll pay attention to the Ruin-NOED connection from now on!

Why not KS? You do realize that the basement isn't always in shack right?

This isn't nothing, I caught the killer's attention, then body blocked the teammate to get him in chase, teabagged him from the other side of the map, the escaped. I have been such a asshole I also saved the clip
---
https://youtu.be/XKwA0gVt9JY
---
Except have you seen how fast the oni breaks pallets? I'm pretty sure he mentions this in the video but you can't drop pallets early against blood fury because the break time is negligible.
---
Hard to determine how much I‚Äôm going to play
---
If she hits you when you arent injured - you were just greedy as shit - if she does while using her power IT means she has it on cooldown and you can just make distance and she will have to slowly walk up with her puny 110movement speed
---
That's such a massive waste of time that by that time she catches up to you, there should be at least a one to 3 gens done by that moment considering solo gen time with ruin is about 82 seconds
---
There is a bunch of mindgames you can do with spirit, aint gonna explain them here, go watch Tru3ta1ent or aby good survivor out there explain it to you if you want
---
Just reached rank 2 today.  Yeah, he is top 3 on console with Spirit and Billy.
---
No fear at all.
---
I don‚Äôt like to run ruin all the time because I like playing with different builds, but yeah once you get into purple ranks as a killer, without ruin there‚Äôs usually 2 or even 3 gens gone before your first down.
---
Fuming mixtapes is probably one of those metal songs whose lyrics are one of Lovecraft's chants, like the chant to reanimate the dead
---
Fully agree with everything here ^^
---
This guy actually watched the vid and responded to it without calling Scott an entitled survivor main.
---
The only real changes that need to be made are:
---
- Cooldown after ending Demon Dash
---
- Fix for seeing blood through walls
---
- Reduce damage cone of Demon Strike
---
Maybes:
---
- Maybe a longer change for Demon Strike (Currently you only need to hold m1 till his hands glow red, which is less than a second)
---
- Maybe reduce mobility to raise skill cap (anything from less strafing to getting kicked out when hitting a wall)
---
This would be my new main killer
---
funny
---
Please don‚Äôt maim her. üòì
---
That makes no sense. It punishes survivor‚Äôs for getting hit. Survivors get hit at least once every trial. It‚Äôs just some that that‚Äôs bound to happen whenever someone plays survivor. There‚Äôs no way to stop it; there are only ways to delay it. Oni‚Äôs power doesn‚Äôt punish the weak. It rewards him for not being brain dead. Does that make any sense?
---
28. Working and going to school takes so much time away from playing. If I do the survivor side of the archives for level 2 I'll probably end up 34 or something.
---
no surprise in killer choice there
---
You got me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I dislike it but I stay because I know it‚Äôs not a guaranteed loss.
---
Honestly I‚Äôd just take an increase in the amount of shards per level you get.
---
That is always a good point, as long as she ain't like Jane we should be good
---

---
Yah I know that but still I like think that Bill was in Nam or something like that because he had a that whole military style I don‚Äôt know
---
Damn son this is just more and more proof that I'm going to love the hell outta nemesis
---
If Nea actually looked as pretty as you I'd actually play her more. Also that is the best pupper costume ever, it even has the glove!
---
He's not at all like Billy, Billy doesn't have a flick. You can literally turn 180¬∞ (or close to it) at the end of your charge, enough to turn corners and smack them in the face. Billy had his flick removed loooong ago, just watch some Zubat and tell me if it is even comparable.
---
new killers are always fun to use and difficult to verse, it's almost as if Killers just got a new toy to play with that survivors aren't used to dealing with; that is normal in pvp games like this.
---
PTB's exsist so bugs can be removed before thry make it into the full release, not so people can propose buffs and nerfs to things they've got barely any experience with.
---
I don‚Äôt need a game to get drunk and yell at my screen because I‚Äôm getting face camped
---
Oh
---
Or maybe your just bad
---
I'm not so sure it does. It takes about as long for a survivor to drop a pallet as it does for the oni to break it.
---
But even if it did, it just means tofu does on the way to the next loop now that the pallet is gone.
---
You‚Äôre cute lol
---
someones upset
---
Win every mind game? Dude what the fuck are you talking about?
---
Lol at the people who put him on a tier list 2 hours after he was put on the PTB
---
The video is a little more nuanced than the title would have you believe. But man Scott is being cringeworthy with this clickbait shit while everyone is learning to play as and against the Oni in the short time the ptb is released, and he still wants to be taken seriously. The guy really wants this to be a 1v1 game when you listen to him talk about what's "balanced" in dbd. Flawed survivor mentality to the core.
---
Holy fuck he can have them, I would be the one getting chased at that point, haha.
---
Total amount doesn‚Äôt really matter, as in theory you can trigger Tier 3 I think 5-6 times a game.
---
I think Oni is a great killer, and definitely a great addition to the game. However, the fact that you can dash and flick to use your instadown, especially around corners, makes him really strong. Combined it with the fact that he can break pallets really fast without completely charging up his power. I think if they nerf him, they‚Äôll either make it so you can‚Äôt flick after your dash, or make it so that you have to charge completely when you want to use your instadown. I almost feel like the fact that he doesn‚Äôt charge his power all the way might be a bug/unintended mechanic, otherwise what is the point of charging up the meter (the lunge is a lot harder to hit with). He‚Äôs a bit harder to juke as well because his hit box seems to be a bit larger compared to Billy‚Äôs chainsaw, but I could be very wrong about that fact. I agree with your locker denial though. If he‚Äôs about to kill you, might as well jump into a locker so he has to waste his power picking a survivor up.
---
We noticed that the Oni appears to be over performing
---
You compared wrong screenshots. Match End Screen was always poop.
---
I usually just watch youtubers that have my humor (diewithlivv), but i sometimes watch Aaron‚Äôs build videos
---
It annoys me that he looks like my David. What a waste.
---
This is the problem right here though.
---
Unless the killer's point was to "punish" you by tunneling, he is perfectly justified in camping/tunneling you if you've proved yourself a good looper. If I'm given the opportunity to quickly down you again because someone safe unhooked, I'm not going to pass on it. Just like survivors won't pass on a ruin spawn that is right next to them at the start. 
---
Tunneling is as annoying of a term to me as gen-rushing is for survivors. I should not have to evaluate every situation and go "Is it fair for me to down this guy?". My only concern should be "He might have DS or BT". One of the most annoying situations to be accused of tunneling: You hook a survivor, move about 40 meters away or so (enough to not trigger BT), survivor is unhooked, you head back because you haven't seen anyone else and you know there are two by that hook. You see the injured one clear as day running for it but no sign of the rescuer. Keeping in mind for killer time is literally everything, should you really stop and search for a possible blendette that you may or may not find? Or should you go and get the easy down and at least slug the guy so he can't do gens and it peels off another survivor to come pick them up?
---
As for camping: If it's not End-Game, camping is an extremely risky gamble that might only kind of pay off. It is a "tactic" that killers have in their toolbox. I have done it before when I feel there is no way to win. I'm sure that makes it seem like "bad killers camp" but I'm talking like 1 gen left in 4 minutes, no hooks. Camping is a way to bait overconfident/overly altruistic survivors into a bad situation and hopefully snowball the match back into your favor. 
---
And considering all the anti-camp mechanics, this is very risky because one wrong swing and even the guy you're camping might escape. If survivors refuse to play and do gens, they also win. Does it suck to be on the receiving end? Yeah. It also sucks to be on the receiving end of a really strong looper as a M1 killer but that doesn't make what the looper is doing invalid or the "wrong" way to play the game. 
---
This response became way too long but I just wanted to offer this from a "killer main" perspective. I do play games to win. I won't exploit, if I see a survivor got screwed by something like getting stuck and I get free them by downing and dropping them, I'll do it. But otherwise, yeah I play to win and sometimes that means tunneling or camping in very specific scenarios. Due to good changes to the game by BHVR, usually tunneling and camping are the wrong choice which is fine because hook and hunt is a lot more fun and intense as killer.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs definitely not op, people just haven‚Äôt learned his counterplay and are too jumpy to nerf anything that can change the meta. 
---
He is billy with a pre requisite and more versatility. He is plague but getting everyone to one shot requires chases and running loops, not spraying puke from 15 yards away and contaminating gens. He is not op, just like plague he doesn‚Äôt have any potential to use his 1 shot until later in the game, this makes him susceptible to gen rushes immersion and is just and m1 killer for half the game. 
---
The difference is billy and plague get their power from the start and can snowball a lot earlier. The Oni is not op, if you have watched more than one YouTuber play the Oni and see his effectiveness in various circumstances controlled by variously skilled players against variously skilled survivors. If you have taken to time to watch multiple games as the Oni and not just one where the killer steamroller once, then you can see he has a high skill ceiling with incredible versatility uniqueness and interesting Add ons that is very healthy for the future of this game. 
---
The killer and the survivor each have 1 great perk 1 okay perk and 1 bad perk and we could see an actual variation in the meta.
---
He activates his ability when you‚Äôre at a jungle gym and now you have no idea where he is. No red stain, no sound, he wins everytime. There is no counter to that
---
If anything, they'll probably remove the obliviousness status effect on Nemesis.
---
cheers love the killer's here
---
What. That might be a PC exclusive?
---
These are fantastic! I'd love it we got them!
---
Me watching someone play Oni on strim:
---
1) WHAT HES BROKEN HES NEEDS TO BE NERFED
---
2) People will only get better with him too this is only the ptb omg omg
---
3) HE CAN SEE THE BLOOD-FARTS THRU WALLS
---
4) Oh, OK, his charge is sorta easy to dodge
---
5) Hes basically billy but cooler, also fuck billy
---
6) He doesn't really need a Nerf. Just a few minor tweaks 
---
7) I hope they fix Yui's pelican ass looking in game model.
---
This is my first released killer/ survivor since playing, I dont see the issue
---
it gets better. i'm sure you'll, somehow, find a friend in real life.

Pallets werent even a problem with the addon. You'd get hits before they drop or vault the pallet
---
Survivor has complete control over the stuns though, or whether or not to use flashlights and when to use them.
---
 This perk has so much counterplay, you just don't like the counterplay which tbh is a you problem.
---
Or you could run past the pallet if he‚Äôs charred up he can‚Äôt cancel it and will be forced to swing letting you get distance
---
I thought that was only for the medkit trick with the purple add on thing.
---
Yup. Currently I know exactly what to expect from team at the lobby.
---
Get matched with Non-camping huntresses with ruin. 
---
2 survivors go down instantly. Me purple and other green rank guy do gen and rescue.
---
I gets 3 gen done with dark sense. 2 survivors farm each other to death. Last guy (green) gets caught then decided to just die to give me hatch.
---
Pretty much every game as a survivor. But as a purple rank killer, I get matched with sweaty red rank swf/ at least purples.
---
Why BHVR?!?
---
He posts clickbait and has a mentality that the game is a 1v1 not a 4v1.
---
I don't accept your apology.
---
Wait, *glitch?* This isn't a hack?
---
he may look buffed, but overall, it‚Äôs a nerf
---
*FBI OPEN UP*
---
Literally
---
I think if you were to make it so that he had to charge his meter all the way (charging the club), you can negate the instant pallet breaks, insane &gt;90 degree flicks, and overall mobility, that would make him not as strong, but still super viable.

I think I know what frame drops look like?
---
I never said I was good.
---
Basement Demo honestly blew me away with how strong it could be.
---
If it glows it goes.
---
Never actually seen Forever Freddy, huh?
---
during PTB of The Spirit Scott Jund said she needed buff
---
That was like a pillow fight
---
&gt;  you just let every other survivor rush gens
---
If the other survivors always knew that the killer is facecamping, this might be the case. But be real, in most ranks the other survivors are just gonna run around the hook or be immersed behind a tree or self-care in some corner. Face camping would be punished so hard if survivors always played optimally but almost all of them don't and that's why in a lot of matches facecamping actually is rewarded
---
We all know you're part of the good team, don't worry. We don't need him.
---
Just like every other killer windows aren‚Äôt meant to safe
---
Longer queue times and sweatier killers/survivors so basically nothing
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
This. Had a nurse completely ignore everyone all game except me. Refused to even hit other survivors who occasionally bodyblocked when they were nearby. Took her 5 gens to 3 hook me (She was camping as well, of course).
---
Of course, I barely black pipped and didn't even get the chance at completing my rift challenge (deplete 6 medkits.) Ranked reset is fun.
---
Just heal before doing gens. Its so annoying when survivors dont bother healing when there's only 2 gens left because they have adrenaline, or they'll just heal later. This killer punishes that.
---
Lol I would care about bloodpoints
---
Bruh people have been saying hes op literally an hour after the ptb went live
---
Ghostface and wraith
---
I dont think that ghostface is overpowered but his power is oretty broken
---
oh boy am i gonna enjoy making the exact same post about TT only to get flamed because TT is cooler than Jund :p
---
copypasting my reply to a different comment: 
---
If the other survivors always knew that the killer is facecamping and are smart enough, this might be the case. But be real, in most ranks the other survivors are just gonna run around the hook or be immersed behind a tree or self-care in some corner. Face camping would be punished so hard if survivors always played optimally but almost all of them don't and that's why in a lot of matches facecamping actually is rewarded
---
Survivors are powerless in the face of quad-hex Myers
---
which in a real game would buy tofu's teammates 5 more seconds to work on gens. Regardless of fun factor and killer power, survivors still have the advantage at top ranks. The game design needs to be fundamentally altered, or as killer your only option is these supposedly "unfun" designs.
---
You made it very well. That what i said to my friend. Don't destroye this hex. He chase me. Exposed and i died
---
imagine not running calm spirit + iron will on steve
---
I was debating about disabling ultra rare and very rare add-ons and offerings. As stated, it's complicated, but I know what you are getting from
---
Oompa loompa doompity doo

I've got another puzzle for you
---
Oompa oompa doompity da dee
---
This is what happens when you teabag me
---
Pffft lol
---
Thanks though. I‚Äôll keep playing casually then. Whenever I pick up a game I have a strong desire to be great at it, so this will save me some stress.
---
I started playing this game last night and I've been using killers, and I kept getting messages from the survivors I'd kill calling me a camper and shit, bit it's not camping? It's strategy
---
Yeah god people are so annoying why can‚Äôt we have powerful killer for the love of god
---
I just tried using devour hope instead of ruin and it got cleansed right before I was about to mori this dude
---
&gt; He's basically a Myers that is able to run fast 
---
Wouldn't this scenario be completely horrifying?
---
Thanks üëçüèª
---
I always see posts complaining about people wanting nerfs but never see posts from people wanting nerfs
---
ez upvotes I guess!
---
Except you wouldn't?  Unless it was an unsafe loop, the survivor could comfortably drop the pallet as soon as you activate your power.
---
Oh no! He has no terror radius and red stain! Guess he's just completely FUCKING INVISIBLE NOW. Dude, are you trolling rn? Seriously, I'VE looped GF's before, he's literally no different from looping a trapper with or without night shroud, just don't make a dumbass move and stick with long walls and your fucking good!
---
I‚Äôve talked to plenty of Insidious Leatherfaces who only get one kill in a match. They don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre performing badly for it, they just want to ruin other people‚Äôs fun
---
The last one I talked to told me he was doing it specifically to punish people for playing console instead of pc. It‚Äôs so absurd
---
\[insert a rant about community being heavily one-sided here\]
---
I'm purple rank and would love bloodpoints though..
---
Wow uhh I now feel attacked yeah I‚Äôm just gonna go
---
A long long time ago, and I‚Äôm a bit fuzzy on it. 
---
I always imagined ghostface as a deadpoolesque slasher, while Legion looks more ... edgy (if that makes sense). 
---
Could be waaaay off tho.
---
I personally don‚Äôt have an issue. It‚Äôs just a joke I found appropriate for the meme lol
---
spirit, high tier killer with solid perks
---
I've accidentally panicked and vaulted out of a window right on top of a Freddy before. If only I could've heard that reaction...
---
They should fix her nose.
---
It‚Äôs because the side you‚Äôre playing has more players.  You‚Äôre put into a queue.  You could be the 100th person in the queue and it will take a while.
---
And water is wet...
---
I'm just correcting this statement of u/pleazeno :
---
&gt;Yeah literally any killer that ever comes out, and every time they get a rework they are considered OP. No killer that has been added is over powered godamn it.
---
Asian women. They usually like it rough.... especially choking
---
Well if it is Haunted Grounds, it's a good thing she didnt waste time healing
---
I mean, if Cruel Confinement was map wide, it'd be a great perk even without the pallet stipulation.
---
I main freddy and wouldnt use that build in a million years lol I would say dying light for sloppy and ruin for pop
---
Wrong because keys are more broken
---
üòò Thanks! You made my day!
---
&gt; ~~Un~~popular opinion
---
FTFY
---
Pair that with infinite tier 3
---
Head-On + Quick &amp; Quiet - 1
---
Head-On - 2
---
Head-On Save - 2
---
Head-On into DS - 2
---
Head-On with Iron Maiden - 3
---
Head-On mid-chase while Injured, no Quick &amp; Quiet - 4 (8 if it turns out they had Bloodhound)
---
which is something LEATHERFACE of all killers could already do by default.
---
Let's play find the feminist. Oh found her!
---
stole my meme lol
---
Calm your tits.. its PTB for a reason
---
probably, but I hope not. You have to gather blood for your ability and you have it for a limited time so it should be stronger than Billy's. IMO
---
I had one guy say to me after he DC‚Äôd ‚ÄúI‚Äôve only played against onis today‚Äù
---
Well... that‚Äôs the point of the PTB..
---
You better heal then counterplay
---
idk a lot of freddys that I go against use fake pallets and I am not a low rank
---
It's just new feng so of course everyone will swap over to her
---
It is actually really fluent!! It surprised me!
---
36, started at 9 so I‚Äôm kinda worried I won‚Äôt finish it in time.
---
Pair that with unbreakable and you're golden.
---
How about the fact that he also has built-in tracking where he sees blood even through walls, the fact that he can curve much more in his dash, and that he can instadown without having to charge the dash?
---
Idk, there haven't been any buffs to them recently, i can understand plague she's actually kinda good, but leather? Idk, he's not too bad if you have PWYF, but still. Glad to hear he's getting some love either way, lol
---
We didn't deserve you, but we needed you
---
Cool, i'm leaving this post with just agree to disagree with you. 
---
My opinion is surge shouldn't be touched again but instead fixing problems with gens.
---

Theres powerful and then theres overpowered as shit. Hes literally a Billy with full control that can multi hit survivors and has built in tracking. He moves so damn fast and can turn corners on a dime and slam you into next year.
---
I play games to have fun and that‚Äôs not fun for me to play against
---
Whoa. Damn, Nemesis is looking like a god tier perk, innit?
---
someone bodyblocking for someone's not a chase tho.  you'll only wind up with more than 1 person in an actual actual chase in accidental sandbags.
---
Having played both sides pretty often, this is just one of those nebulous things people complain about. Frankly, hooking somebody could teleport the killer across the map and make the survivor invulnerable until the next kill, and people would *still* be in here complaining about tunneling and camping.
---
It's just how it goes. I've been accused of camping in games where I had full stacks of Devour Hope. Some people, like yourself, make it into some big ideological issue. The truth is that the people who just sit in your face while you die or hyperfocus on one person and ignore everybody else are generally just relatively new to the game and don't know what else to do. Really skilled survivors *want* the killer to tunnel, because no pressure is put on the rest of the team while the endless chase is going on.
---
Same here! But not In a meeting and more of in the reading room...
---
Except we just established that that would have gotten him downed just slightly later. The optimal play would, like Scott said, be to get into the locker so that oni has to give up his power which is fun for no one
---
I think some people (by some I mean those claiming something is op after one game) need to learn when something is truly overpowered or just really good.
---
It already has almost 0 charge time, much larger range of control and you can bump into anything.  And his ability also gives him a one shot that takes almost no charge as well.  The flick will be nerfed 100%.  There‚Äôs no doubt about that.
---
In the original *Scream* the Ghost Face was actually two teenagers in Sydney's (the MC) social group, her boyfriend Billy and Stu.
---
Billy was a serial killer specifically plotting against Sydney, but Stu was just a spree killer tagging along with Billy for the fun of it. Billy:Frank what Stu:the gang.
---
... and Ghost Face really wasn't a silly/Deadpool type until the parody movie *Scary Movie* came out ( obligatory "WAAHZZAAAAAPPPP!!!!" :P )  although he was a purely non-supernatural killer, so when he got hit, *it hurt* and he would realistically fall down.
---
The mind change is likely hoping nemesis won‚Äôt be nerfed because of Legion and that Legion won‚Äôt be nerfed because of nemesis. It‚Äôs annoying dealing with 20 nerfs and 2 more coming we don‚Äôt want to increase the number of nerfs he already has. I don‚Äôt want this either but I definitely don‚Äôt want legion to have this exploit again because it potentially means way more nerfs for my main down the road when the devs actually do something about it.
---
The doge with the squished head looks soooo cool üòÇ
---
Tbh i'm not sure about Oni, i love his design, but his power looks like it could be frustrating to use (with it being lost when you pick up a survivor, requiring a lot of set-up etc.) but at the same time it looks like a lot of fun when it's active.
---
I'm right here. I've been waiting for this. When will you suck dick?
---
True. I guess it does but i sometimes have trouble with totems so the change i said would be nice.
---
No? It released two more than two months later.
---
ok
---
Making a survivor drop the pallet with a click of a button? That's more than any killer could ask for.
---
There is a lightside to Hyde, he really genuinely loves being evil. Micheal seems to treat it more like an occupation.
---
Is it possible that it's way too easy to win with him because he's two days old and no one knows what to do about him yet?
---
meh I think he's pretty balanced overall considering that his power has a cooldown of 30 seconds and can be disabled in only 3
---
Just started playing again and often I‚Äôll do 4 or 5 of the gens by myself. I was hoping it was a low rank issue
---
lol wut?
---
That's idiotic. Sounds like BHVR.
---
2 kills/2 escapes is obviously a tie.
---
That is end game Freddy which id take any day over forever Freddy.
---
keep that attitude man, you are one of the good eggs
---
Obviously his intentions were teaming with the killer and just being a dick head. Not saying your in the wrong, but don‚Äôt ask ppl questions like that when u clearly know what their intentions were.
---
He‚Äôs overpowered at all doe we play same game? You know the game where survivors do gens at lightning speed yeah I‚Äôm sorry but people aways look at a killer at face value and decide if it‚Äôs op or not not taking into consideration about how powerful survivors can be ie 3 gens in 1:20 like yeah I‚Äôm sorry but the killer been out for 2 days that is nowhere enough time to decide how powerful they are
---
I don't think it's going to be meta by any means, but imagine it on Nurse - knowing where all of the vaults and pallets are before even entering a jungle gym will be crazy powerful on her. Same goes for Doc, to a lesser extent.
---
unless it's Freddy, in which case get fucked cause oblivious is stupid
---
No, cause its like 50 minutes long. No one is going to sit through 50 minutes of the same argument that's just been disputed.
---
That's why I smurf.
---
lol she isnt minor, she clearly has a driving license for riding those fast bikes
---
B O N K
---
I thought that too, but it also means a lot of strategic gameplay. Do you want to slug and attempt to snowball the game with the risk of losing every survivor? Or do you want to hook and attempt to earn back your power. 
---
Imma see how he does for a few weeks after release, against and as him. I like the strategy to him tho, but I wonder if the devs will end up changing the picking up a survivor and losing power mechanic
---
They're obviously talking about Insidious.
---
In my opinion, he is completely fine. Maybe change the amount of blood that drops from survivors because he can get his power pretty fast after using it, but other than that he is fine.
---
People are already suggesting crazy nerfs like removing his flick, adding collision and giving him less control in his charge. At that point, might as well remove Billy‚Äôs curving LOL. 
---
He still gets destroyed by optimal gens and loopers, as every killer does but he does have potential for 3 gen better than billy does.
---
For moris I feel like you should have to have gotten the survivor into the struggle phase. Ebony allows you to kill every survivor who hit struggle. Green should allow two. Yellow should allow one. I think this would be a decent balance change because as of now certain killers such as hillbilly, leatherface, doctor, and nurse have very few or no ultra rare addons so they get more ebony moris in the blood web. The fact that you can load into a match, and due to poor luck, start within 30 meters of the killer and end up getting downed and hooked within the first 2 minutes just to get rescued and tunneled down again to be mori'd instantly is asinine. It really takes just encourages toxic gameplay from killers.
---
It‚Äôs a all rank issue.. if you find yourself not in a chase, not popping a gen, not cleansing a totem (barely do that) then what are you doing?
---
Except leatherface has neither demon's map control nor speed. It's a short range speed billy move more than it is a leatherface one.
---
Dont forget this [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/left4dead/images/b/be/Concept-character-bill.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081111070220](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/left4dead/images/b/be/Concept-character-bill.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081111070220)
---
 outplayed
---
I‚Äôm sorry, a friend sent it to me on twitter :(
---
Personally I like the ultimatum that presents to the killer.
---
So nothing to say about how unfun most other killers are to play?
---
Scott is a bit of an airhead though when it comes to things. His whole debate video about the spirit had nothing but straw man arguments and he was wrong about most things when it came to the spirit and clearly had no idea how high levels play. He‚Äôs not very good
---
This. I've been saying this since it was announced. It's going to be INSANE on a Nurse who can read and has the muscle memory on lock.
---
Because you're doing the gen while injured
---
You mean like what clown does? Or wraith?
---
You're just salty because you're not good against him, aren't you? Right? Come on, you can't be serious!
---
Right, like Sloppy Butcher. I was just noticing that they forgot to directly mention that. No biggie, this is why they do beta tests like they are now
---
I regret messaging him now, might delete this post. I was angry at the time but now that I‚Äôve cooled down it was obviously pretty dumb to do lol. I was trying to complete a challenge and was frustrated.

Gonna have to use the monkey‚Äôs paw to wish that HG was never made because 1/4 of this sub‚Äôs jokes are based around it

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dzmdfu/dunno_if_its_been_cross_posted_yet/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
With Breakdown coming out, sabo builds might become a tiny bit relevant!
---
In the video he says that in a 1v1 chase he has no counter, but he can still lose the game. Please at least watch more than a minute of the video if you're going to try and criticize his opinions.
---
He says that he's basically a Billy, sometimes better sometimes worse. 
---
The whole video is basically "oni isn't fun for survivors, but idk what you can change that isn't just nerfing him and making the killer less fun"
---
Sorry I‚Äôm a dude. But multiple women in my family were molested. So forgive me if I‚Äôm not gung-ho for the subtext.
---
Wait is there no collision during his run?
---
*trapper fucking spikes pichu*
---
Wanna make a bet?
---
Thank fuck, would fucking love that
---
So what I‚Äôm taking away from this is survivor mains want his power to be removed. Thus is kinda why I lean towards the ptb not being as good an idea as some would think. Too many people complain if the killers have any chance of victory
---
If your teammate farms you off hook, that's not the killer's problem. I'm downing you if they don't have BT and then chasing them while you are slugged.
---
Though I do think survivors need some balance changes too. The fact that a survivor can crank out a gen in 80 seconds by their self is rough. Especially with the fact that if 1 survivor is looping the killer and the other 3 are working on their individual gens, that's realistically 3 gens completed in a 1 minute and 30 second span. So it makes perks such as Ruin and Noed almost a necessity. I feel like there should be some sort of penalty to having multiple gens being worked on at once. Perhaps more frequent skill checks and slightly more difficult because they're all slowly powering up at once and overloading a grid or something. I don't know. Just a thought there.
---
Despite being able to hit more people in frenzy, deep wound is a much less consequential status effect, making the power less useful as a time waster.
---
Maybes are a hard no imo I somewhat agree on the other ones though but if he gets these kinds nerfs I think they need to get rid of pick up getting rid of your power because that pretty much makes you slug and also give survivors the ability to screw you over by jumping in lockers his power should be crazy and threatening 
---
So Longer charge time to get into demon furry but have it so he doesn‚Äôt get put out of demon fury when picking people up
---
I think "I'm gonna die so that you can't use your power" being a survivor's best option is shit.
---
Most killers do need buffs. That has nothing to do with the argument at hand and we're in agreement on it.
---
As a survivor main that plays a lot of killer, I never thought of it this way. Actually sounds cool when you put it that way, won't mind next time I die to it lol
---
If you really need map pressure, you can slug to save time
---
No there is not.
---
Then if this game goes against your morals of having to buy stuff inside a game stop playing it and refund it and move on instead of whining?  
---
&gt; You're so desperate to have the moral high ground because you'll shell out any amount to keep playing something you already bought
---
Dude you are talking so much shit. I love this game. I have played it for 2 years and i have gotten so much playtime and so much enjoyment out of it, of course i'm going to keep spending money on it until the day i don't find it fun anymore. You are beyond pathetic.
---
That's why I think every killer should have to hook all survivors first before being allowed to mori them with an ebony. So you can't mori Meg, Dwight, and Claudette after you've hooked them if you haven't even found Jake yet. If an ebony required struggle phase to occur before you could mori then the rarity should be changed, in my opinion. I totally agree that ebonies as they are now encourage extremely unfun and unfair gameplay from killers, especially with them knowing survivors literally can't do anything about it.
---
The rank error pips for some player is not yet fixed so they cant do yet.
---
they already plan on lessoning how much is taken away when u pick up a survivor
---
That's my point; Killer wants Survivors to start together gameplay wise, but have the add on that separates Survivors. Vice versa for Survivors.
---
Self-caring in a corner.
---
Just make it match the battlepass. Problem solved.
---
I am serious. Try healing on Lerys or Hawkins against a GF with Nurses. Its impossible. He‚Äôll just attack you out of stealth when he comes arpund a corner. His movement needs to be much louder
---
I put "demo" my phone auto corrected to "demon"
---
Oh man that's pretty interesting. So if you're bold enough(and he's bad enough) you can run through him to confuse him.
---
So don't use Hex: Ruin 4head
---
Except you‚Äôre not dead. You get hooked, which if your team is halfway decent, will still happen two more times.
---
Well no ones gunna play nurse on console so shes out. People are jumping off the spirit ship cuz in about 2 weeks shes not gunna be a free win machine. So that really only leaves ghost face and billy.
---
Precisely. If a killer shows ANY signs of being the power role, survivors will bitch about it until nerf. Which saddens me because playing as the oni all day was the most fun I‚Äôve had in this game for a while, even going against optimal survivors.
---
If they nerf him that‚Äôs just proof that survivors have control over this game and killer players like me will probably just stop playing
---
That‚Äôs kinda the issue with it being a game. You want people to have fun.
---
However anybody saying that Oni is OP almost seem like they are salty they lost. Just because the killer won doesn‚Äôt make him imbalanced
---
Ready when you are big boy xD
---
Oh wow Oni isn‚Äôt fun for survivors? So what‚Äôs your opinion on No Mither Sabo SWF squad? Or brand new part gen rushing squad because those are pretty unfun but also my favorite thing you said was he is uncounterable in 1v1 first off no we don‚Äôt know that yet and 2 THE GAME IS A 4v1 NOT A 1v1 I‚Äôm sorry but you could easily loop him in his base form for like 1:20 and get like 3 gens done in his base form
---
*BBQ intensifies*
---
It's crazy to me how many people have every perk on every character and have several prestiges. Like I have 80 hours and have half the survivors unlocked and I still don't have every teachable on the survivors. I think I have teachables on 3 or 4 survivors and 3 killers. It must take like 200 hours minimum just to get every teachable on all characters without ever prestiging.
---
Not 80's enough. Pinhead has my vote.
---
No friends to play it with PepeHands

Honestly, Leatherface can really dominate in red ranks because everyone plays teambased. You can time the exact moment someone will run for the unhook and punish them both.
---
You've clearly played with every console player on the web.
---
I Don‚Äôt Understand this
---
I see. Makes sense.
---
It‚Äôs painful but as you rank up it gets better, less self care and more gen rushing
---
But he gets to use it way less than billy, so it should be stronger than billy
---
I only downloaded the PTB to get killed by Monto on stream lol
---
This is always my solo survivor experience lol. Usually why I only play with friends now.
---
Good but I‚Äôd say it should take non like what it‚Äôs your main objective why should you be punished for it
---
Nah but been playing for awhile now and if I‚Äôm not SWF  then I‚Äôm pretty doomed with teammates
---
And that's fun for no one. Oni's power being exactly one free hook every time you find a survivor with it will suck for both sides.
---
For survivors because they won't feel like they have the option to win.
---
For oni because he won't get to use his power (which is apparently pretty damn fun) properly.
---
Which windows? 8, 10, 7, Vista?
---
So in the area where the killer should have the extreme advantage (1v1) he has a extreme advantage. What is this some type of team based game
---
Well, there WILL be a punishment for DCing when the new chapter comes out. But until then, there's no reason not to when the game is screwing up.
---
The killer doing well and you doing poorly isn't a valid reason to DC, of course.
---
He is pretty much a better hillbilly but he can‚Äôt use his power all the time
---
XP
---
The problem is current rank reset makes the game fucking awful for everyone who's NOT red/purple rank for about a week out of every month. As a yellow/green Killer, I should just straight up never be playing against red ranks. The match will be super unfun for me, and probably pretty boring for the red ranks. This change to rank reset is a much needed fix for overall game health.
---
me reddittor, me downvote someone for no reason
---
You should almost never hit two people with that attack. Like...never ever. The only time it is plausible is unsafe unhook (which you shouldn't be doing) and hanging at the exit gates.
---
I've actually always thought that ruin should essentially become base kit. Like, good skill checks should pause generator progress, greats do nothing. Ruin should then be changed to remove great skill checks altogether and each good skill check hit should regress and pause generator progress. Also, after rank 15 I think survivors should stop getting notifications for perks that the killer has active. Like, why do I get a notification of ruin or huntress' lullaby? I don't think those should happen anymore.
---
I personally like juke montages a lot, aside from that, gameplay and educational. It's always interesting when the community finds some new tech, or seeing the new strategies before they become meta
---
Ah, ok. Never really paid attention to the deep wound timer while being chased anyway, so never noticed it didn't go down then.
---
That‚Äôs just fact. The major reason to use fake pallets, in my opinion, is the fun of tricking survivors. But it stands no chance in terms of power level, compared to snare
---
‚ÄúFree hook for every time you find a survivor‚Äù bruh that‚Äôs literally the point of a killers power is to get them the hook as fast as possible. The entire POINT of tier lists is to rank there ability to do so.
---
'cause the last panel is Oni B O N K toxic Feng, too brutal to show
---
Its not that, his charge is not stopped by bumping into objects like the hilbilly's is. He as a model does have a colission.
---
Actually his dash already does no damage it just that you can chain his dash into his bash. His dash is just movement
---
We all remember old Freddy's release
---
I don‚Äôt know but this chapter is looking like real shit
---
"You really bringing in your weeb shit into the trial? Fucking cri-"
---
funnyn't\*
---
Oh totally misunderstood gotcha
---
And an overdone joke.
---
Congratulations OP.
---
I mean Totems are harder(ish) to find then gens. The time to cleanse the totems is 70(14\*5) seconds. So double or triple that especially for uncoordinated groups if you start including the finding time. In games against good killers I'm not sure how much time you have because they can put a lot of pressure out. Maybe I'm a bad survivor but I feel the need to do gens quick or they will snowball the game at some point. 
---
I'm not attacking NOED; just the idea that every game you can do all 5 totems. I have to crank out gens just to get 2 or 3 of us out. I find that its just unfun to play with or against.
---
TLDR: A lot of games don't have time to search and kill 5 totems.
---
And yet it won't be fun. At all.
---
But fun doesn't matter right? Fun has nothing to do with why people play this video game.
---
No those are completely valid points. The issue is everything you just said is completely fair and justified. I watch Streamers who are god tier killers IMO "tunnel" and "camp".
---
 The issue I have is for example I've just activated Escape Cake, my friend uses BPS, killer uses BPS, its a good day. I spawn into the game and within seconds hear the whirring of a billy chainsaw and before I know it I've been downed before I can even get a Reunited Bonus from the teammate I spawned next to. I'd be annoyed but that's just how it goes sometimes. I get hooked and one of my team come to unhook me his chainsaw still in the distance but no terror radius. I get unhooked and before you know it he's back running our way. I dodge and loop him for a while but through sheer tunnelling willpower he knocks me down. I don't run DS so I accept the rehook. Repeat this again in the space of 1 or 2 minutes and you sir have a wasted game. 
---
In the post game I would question them. They respond "salty survivor cry cry :((" like what do I even say to that level of brain dead?
---
In ever so slightly less common circumstances It isn't someone with an insta-down. They can do the same thing I described above, maybe with less finesse and ease but easily enough. The usual reasoning Is Gen's being done with or without ruin or looping. Am I supposed to accept that I just wasted whatever item or offering I used because the Killer doesn't know how to play or counter build against people who gen rush or loop? The hardcore tunnellers and campers wont get any better if they don't grow and adapt. Then, like me last night, you have a rank 7/8 spirit who for some reason streams this BS content tunnel and camp you out of the game.
---
Also Gen-Rushing for me at least has become a valid form of counter-play to tunnellers or campers to the point where in pre-game I have to say "If I get tunnelled after first hook just rush gens." So in a sense the only reason I gen rush is because killers tunnel because they hate gen-rushing which is pure irony if you think about it.
---
Yup when the counter becomes waste pallets you know your ass is in trouble lol.  My Freddy puts in work against SWF.
---
100% wrong. Read the description; it only applies to *pallet* stuns. Head on and Decisive strike users are completely unaffected.
---
Watch Fungoose, he's on YouTube &amp; Twitch. He's on a 100+ 4k streak with Plague, no Ruin or add-ons, and his Bubba is a monster. God of DbD imo
---
I know that feeling bro...
---
Honestly, Nemesis is already pretty niche, either use it for legion for his bleeding out + chase combo or use in on Mikey with the addon to get more EW stalking from the obsession or with rancor so you always have someone to mori at endgame.
---
Lol ok dude well I've watched it all and formed my own opinions based on all available information.
---
Sorry you just regurgitate whatever Scott jund vomits into your mouth. Have a nice day.

---
lol survivors complained about spirit and have now moved onto Ghostface. great job guys
---
I dunno. Bonking survivors sounds pretty fun to me. Feeling like a super natural entity that survivors are supposed to fear is the whole point of playing killer.
---
No doubt
---
Maybe even more!
---
But right now it‚Äôs insanely better than billy.  Demon mode is very very strong.  If he had demon dash alone I think he would be fine but the fact he can one shot without using demon dash nerfed cause he‚Äôs pretty much a Myers who gets Tier 3 easily and can move around like Billy and down people like Myers.
---
Well she‚Äôs not wrong
---
I am a killer main who plays survivor regularly and I never mind killer downing me with it. Even if I am being downed after looping him whole game and in the end all it took was an attempt to shield my teammate.
---
Frankly, after this perk was made a hex perk when totems were introduced, you have every chance to avoid it. If we as survs still let it activate, its on us. Not the killer.
---
Lol not happening
---
Unhook 15 survivors. Must unhook safely. Must be done in a single trial.
---
100% agree. I like playing stealthy as survivor and I've given my position away to GF quite a few times because I accidentally looked at him. It's really frustrating and I feel like it's not an intended function by the devs. Glancing at him for a brief moment gives away your position? Really?
---
A good solution to this would be that the reveal process takes a couple seconds before it begins. This not only buffs GF by requiring more time for him to get revealed, but it helps survivors not accidentally give away their position by looking at him. Maybe a little bar fills up for survivors over two seconds to let you know what you're about to begin the reveal process, and you can look away to cancel it and GF won't be notified.
---
I made big oof
---
BUt He HaS a InSTaDoWn also seems like they enjoy giving killers pallet smash skills now huh? Kinda nice to see
---
After reading this i can feel the power of 10,000 suns burning at once
---
The art is amazing but at the same time: ew
---
heck, lets make it a zombie circle like Nazeebo.
---
Except you won't be bonking anyone. You'll just be pulling people out of lockers constantly.
---
OP:
---
1. Doctor because of all the different effects
---
2. Legion and Plague because they apply their powers to multiple survivors at once and it can snowball pretty hard. 
---
3. Ghostface because the exposed status lasts a long time 
---
4. Michael‚Äôs add-ons are OP but the expose can sweep teams
---
Worst:
---
1. Huntress - she just throws hatchets and they can be juked
---
2. Nurse - she can be juked easily depending on player ability or patterns
---
He's not going to like the entire 2 weeks after the release of Oni then...
---
I think they need Killer leaderboards, and your reward is based on that instead. That way people will play shit killers just to try to get to the top of the leaderboard for that killer.
---
Questions my fave boy how could you all do this to my boy Peanits
---
Hopefully we get a creepy future map someday since the entity can pull from across time.
---
Then you can submit more art because this is FANTASTIC
---
It's funny to go to their stream after the game and see how they react to you doing stuff. I just play normally and like to see if they say anything about how I played
---
Getting looped by that little fucker in his stupid ice cream outfit is starting to give me PTSD.
---
Stick to the hot chicks! I least I'm chasing a carrot on a stick that actually looks appealing!
---
Except you're just doing exactly what you're accusing me of by siding with a personality instead of an argument?
---
Ok first of all, calm down buddy. I'm not the other guy and I actually never said I think surge needs a buff. I said I dont think its op or even particularly strong right now, but even more so was talking about that specific build. That's not even a build you would use surge in.
---
Surge is almost exclusively uses with perks like surveillance. I was mostly saying that build you gave is not particularly strong and would not be broken if surge got a buff. That was all I was saying
---
serect yur currr
---
Oh I‚Äôll go to a gen, to bonk other survivors. Especially the ones I find with his ultra rare addon
---
YALL OUT HERE TALKING ABOUT THE NEW KILLER STRENGTH?! HE IS NOT EVEN OUT ON LIVE YET GOT DAMNN. Chill yourselves survivors. He is definitely counterable. Telegraphed movement, jukeable instant down, loud noises. Furthermore, he is M1 until he hits a survivor. Can't survivors just loop him while he is in his weak state? Don't even need you to tell me cause I know they can. He is a ticking time bomb like Myers except his power requires him to get a hit in first. He will be strong that's for sure but he will not beat Billy who, MIGHT I REMIND YOU, has his instant down at the beginning of the match, moves faster, and can do the same flick thing Oni can do. Furthermore, Billy is way less telegraphed than Oni. The killed needs no damn nerfs objectively speaking. I rest my case.
---
Thanks, that truly means a lot.
---
yeah ik the hg jokes are a little overdone, but my friend thought what happened to us was really funny and asked me to draw it so i did lmao
---
And other killers will pay for that wall.
---
If you‚Äôre not into Steve, regardless of sexuality, I‚Äôm sorry to say it but you have absolute shit taste.
---
what show/movie is this from?
---
This is the reason, people got angry than an already weak killer got weaker (the uffs to his feral frenzy are negligible and making the hits with feral frenzy has NEVER been his issue, his issue is that he is an M1 killer any tie he wants to actually down people with nothing to help him get it).
---
So now everyone that sometimes plays him wants him to have at least ONE good perk build even if its broken.
---
I would agree that Scott isn't perfect and is prone for exaggeration at times but...
---
&gt;clearly had no idea how high levels play 
---
This kinda sounds the same airhead as the things you are calling as such.
---
Well to be fair against a good swf you could literally just run straight from pallet to pallet (chasing someone who drops them) and by the time you broke all of them all 5 gens would be popped.
---
But yes he is very strong lol
---
Carrylizard is now one with the fog.. new survivor confirmed. Lmao
---
Yep...
---
People like you are why ok killers get nerfed into the fucking ground
---
++
---
This is implying that scoops Steve is not appealing which is ultimately a false statement
---
If a killer seems completely uninterested in patrolling gens and applying pressure on them and instead focuses on tunneling down survivors or camping. It's highly likely they've got Noed. They're not worried about endgame because they assume they'll get a free kill or two at the end. That's why it's so satisfying to get all 5 cleansed and watch them happily chase someone down expecting the instant down before they realize.... oh wait
---
yeah I wish it was more universally known lol I do the little dance if i‚Äôm being camped so for me, if you see me dancing, DO GENS
---
Grass grows. Birds fly. Sun shines and bruddah, I hurt people.
---
I'm not a fan of Scott Jund either, but we should attack the arguments, not him.
---
A broken clock can be right twice a day.
---
im meeting it with a ‚Äòwhy would i want a THIRD way to have to get even more cosmetics when i already have no way to get auric cells‚Äô. imo the store idea is absolutely genius but i think it‚Äôd be cool if it let you customize small things, like the in game obsession symbol(? claws? idk), the campfire (swf visit the hosts decked out campfire pregame), special nametag emblems and stuff like that. not really sure exactly how thatd work but i know i want it
---
If Killer DC's, Killer earns ZERO points for that match. Survivors keep all points they've earned up to that point, and keep their items.
---
In terms of points, Killers who DC are definitely hurting nobody but themselves.
---
Underrated post
---
Yeah, Ruin is annoying for me as survivor because I cant hit skill checks for shit and as killer cause it gets cleansed so quick, I might start using corrupt intervention
---
u/powbang I hope Devs see your idea and consider it.
---
Okay? And then they get in a locker and the one you left goes to do gens? Or you get the down without the survivor having options and theres the argument inward making again.
---
I missed it personally.
---
To say nothing of killers who expect to 4K every match and aren‚Äôt okay with just 2K (which devs have said counts as a killer win).
---
I mean the meme aint good but at least its not a shitty overused format. Get me upvote xd
---
Fair
---
Hes being sarcastic
---
Why are people calling her Yui when they call Feng Min ‚ÄúFeng‚Äù which is her surname?
---
I've had this happen to me too
---
So Play another game if this one doesnt bring you fun , we dont want you on our teams you filthy DC player
---
Seems to me that if you wait for the struggle phase for a mori, you might as well have just hooked again for BBQ, Dying Light, Pop, Blood Warden, Lullaby, and Blood Echo.
---
If you mori after the first hook, you're potentially giving up all those interactions, but you're also taking a survivor out before one or more additional chases. That seems like a decent trade. If you need someone in struggle, then one more hook would kill them anyway, and you're paying a large price for an animation. Some of those perks few are going to run, but BBQ and Pop in particular would make a mori a bad decision.
---
In other words, it doesn't seem like a mori would be worth it at all at that point, except for some giggles.
---
All killers get nerfs before they leave the ptb
---
My theory is people just haven't learned to counter them yet so understandably scream OP and the devs nerf.  Then launch happens and the killer is meh...
---
Legion and Demogorgon are great examples of where this has happened.  Both were considered wildly OP on the ptb.  Now they are both bottom tier killers.  
---
That said I think ghostface is a good example of where devs got it right.  It got the normal OP screams but no major nerfs.  They make him Just a touch faster to break out of stealth but the box to break him out smaller.    Overall he is a good midrange killer now.  Not op but not shit tier.  Hopefully the same happens here.
---
I mean yeah do it with nemesis
---
I mean I love playing as Steve but his whining is a little much.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt it? If you‚Äôre allowed to completely nullify his power then why shouldn‚Äôt he get any indication of where you are?
---
what a baby
---
Public test build
---
You have options though. You put down pallets early and waste time. You find structures like one one in the new map that actually makes it difficult for him to use his power. Ya know waste the killers time.
---
You mean it isn't a ranking system designed by the Electric Light Orchestra? :(
---
It‚Äôs only against spirit I don‚Äôt have fun, most red rank players also don‚Äôt give a shit about their rank so it doesn‚Äôt bother people
---
The only thing I can see them nerfing is his ridiculous turning when in his rage power. (Or whatever it's fucking called)
---
Unpopular Opinion:  Eating food makes you less hungry.

And spirit is a part of the game - so learn to Play with her against you or gtfo

Well this is my third alt for this sub since I've been banned so many times lol. Maybe you have a point, but the DbD community is so clapped that it's hard not to get mad at all the console Urban P1 Neas who spread their dogshit opinions all over this sub sometimes.

Yikes dude that last panel is something special

I'm hoping he will be killer some day but not this time.
---
I... wasn‚Äôt referring to myself. I haven‚Äôt actually played survivor in the PTB yet. Actually, I almost never play survivor.
---
If 4 people are still alive the hatch doesn't spawn until all gens are done correct? 
---
I thought the hatch spawn rules were as follows,
---
4 people - 0 gens left; 3 people - 1 gen left; 2 people - 2 gens left; 1 person - Spawns no matter what.
---
So you've hooked someone they cant all just leave with a key. The worst you could get is 3 people and 1 gen left and I could see that being frustrating.
---
Wow your art style is beautiful, I love it!

Counter point: Appetizers.

Found the guy who gets bodyblocked because he is tunneling so hard all the time lol

Of course it does, its a link to a subreddit! The link needs to be written perfectly or else it doesn't work

I‚Äôm referring to the fact that blood orbs pool up and stay there forever. And I‚Äôm not the one doing a gen while injured. I know a little better than that.

Le hammer to a sword fight meme . I forget where the original template is

Wouldn‚Äôt pig work too because you could force their trap timer to run out.

Demogorgan got buffed out of ptb? Spirit got buffed our of ptb?  Anyway balancing something isn't a bad thing.

I wish there was an easy way to search through your own comments... give me a sec I'll look for my reply to one of those doctor buff brainstorm posts

Which is useless against swf
---
yep :)
---
the dr should be able to provide basic medical coverage for the survivors
---
Wasn't implying that it's your individual perspective.
---
Just frustrating when survivors act like having to heal before getting back on gens is a massive inconvenience. When it should be the default strategy (most of the time).
---
Oni is just a huge example of this, because if you repair a gen while injured, you give him full power gauge. Which I like! Punish survivors for choosing not to heal. (I play both sides btw. Red rank killer, purple rank surv)
---
Imagine Kate with the same cosmetics
---
I get he was an assholes but don‚Äôt make fun of him being in the navy. You could have said something else.
---
I wasn‚Äôt complaining about getting injured. I‚Äôm saying the power gets instantly charged because all the blood orbs stay there forever. So when the survivor gets downed, they just need to pick them up and instantly get full charge. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about. I‚Äôve said before that I have literally no survivor bias.
---
Green Mori should be baseline imo.
---
No? Every single one of these "hints" were disproven
---
Oh, you bet your ass I do.
---
Wtf?
---
Haven't seen a single post complaining about him yet
---
Billy has cooldown
---
Poor claudine doesn‚Äôt everyone realize Neas took over as the most toxic survivor
---
If leatherface came out today Jund would be calling it op because he can instadown.
---
How about also with Flip Flop and Buckle Up for the memes?
---
Ptb is buggy af wtf do you mean
---
Not sure. Im not on the PTB. Im just saying these threads are people who aren't on the PTB or are on console and are saying they want the chance to play with an OP killer before hes nerfed to feel that power. Im not saying he needs to be nerfed or hes OP. Im just saying a lot of these people are upset that if he is OP they dont get to play with him while he is OP so they can have fun unfairly smashing people.
---
B O I N K
---
I‚Äôm not saying oni doesn‚Äôt need tuning, I‚Äôm saying Scott‚Äôs examples are bad.
---
Fake pallets are more fun but they are really map dependent.
---
But they were still hints. Like the following on twitter, and the reference to "last year the nightmare"
---
Moris allow you to kill a survivor after hooking them only once and keys lets survivors escape through the hatch without finishing the gens and/or after the killer closes it. Both are bullshit and ruin the fun of the game.
---
Morid By Words
---
It does yeah, BHVR confirmed when DS got changed that if you're using rancor you could theoretically get a 4k mori. Nemesis is going to make that an actual possibility, pallet me and I'll mori your ass!
---
I actually think more exhaustion perks should have passive buffs. Like Lithe making you vault faster. It would be cool.
---
What? The score? Uh, yeah just burn a 100% boost BP specific offering and get a 32k game and the extra 8k will make it 40. Neat?
---

Demon Mode has 1.  Demon Dash with as fast as billy movement speed, no penalty for running into objects as you can just move around them, very little cooldown and charge time, better control of your dash, and an insane flick.  And 2.  Demon strike, which is just an insta down that can break pallets very quickly.  
---
I‚Äôm not saying his ability should be equal to Billy‚Äôs.  It should be better.  But he already has almost no charge or cooldown as well as better maneuvering no penalty for running into walls and an insta down at the end.  The flick is unfair.  You can 90 degree curve flick around walls.  You remove the insane flick, you still have everything else as well as a one shot insta down.
---
This man deserves a medal
---
Over smooth...?
---
Scott's example was a strong jungle gym which would work against almost any other killer.
---
I'd appreciate shards, frankly, since I'd rather buy cosmetics with shards than my real money. I think that would be a nice reward.
---
Yep. Have had the same thing happen to me. Some people you just can't reason with. And those are the vocal ones usually. When I play killer, if there is a streamer, I usually watch my game afterward as a way to think through what I am doing. Listening to streamers sometimes can be bit aggravating. Especially if you slug someone early on and go for another survivor, head back and down them again after they get healed. THEN hook them. They say you are tunneling. Dude...... this is your first hook.
---
Why did you not use the crosspost functionality when you literally got this from another subreddit?
---
I play about half and half so not a ton of killer but I'll give my take.
---
It depends on the streamer. 95% of them are just chill people that play the game normally. The other 5% are OoO, flashlight clicking, tea bagging, ect.. And usually a decent looper. They are seeking to embarrass the killer for the audience. And no one really enjoys being made a fool of. I'm a really bad killer and you just feel shitty afterwards. Its not fair or nice but I'm guessing they take it out on the next ttvs they see.
---
Just a case of a few assholes ruining it for the others because as humans we tend to lump everyone in a group together and not take the individual as they are.
---
Because no mither is such a useful perk currently
---
le killer has arrived
---
And would still have worked.... if tofu threw the pallet.
---
So put a cd on it. Killers are supposed to have strong perks, its 1v4.
---
I was not there for that. Were people calling him op?
---
this comment made me laugh so hard, prolly bc I AM that scoops ahoy Steve
---
I really like this idea to make different survivors worth different things!
---
*but*, BHVR is putting too kuch into cosmetics, and one or two survivors will always be "meta" and the others will be ignored, meaning less cosmetics, less money, soo...doubtful we'll see it.
---
That‚Äôs not punishing *a* survivor for not healing. That‚Äôs punishing the entire team because one survivor didn‚Äôt heal. Not everyone can heal whenever they‚Äôre injured, even if they wanted to.
---
Aww, that's so sweet :D
---
I love her and will kill for her
---
What specifically are you complaining about OP?
---
Check replies , some people aren't overly happy currently and are curious on how strong he really is
---
Perhaps, but don‚Äôt count on it too much. Might be a mix of both.
---
Ok, you know what, I'm curious, what do YOU suggest doing to Ghost?
---
What would make him balanced in your view?

With no context I can‚Äôt agree nor disagree

I hope you're wearing shoes out there I heard he can sniff out feet better than blood
---
Cringe
---
there've definitely been much buggier ptbs but it definitely has some notable ones like on Haddonfield
---
The doctor is hard to play. Its normal when you don't know how to play, you think he need a buff. But the doctor can make fake dropped pallet, false terror radius, red vision in your back like if he was behind you. Illusion that doctor can see. Skill check moving. You tell your position when you are in his terror radius. You cannot drop pallet or vault when you are under shock. When you are in phase 3 of craziness. You can't do generator. There is hard skill check that if you miss, he know where you are and you can't do anything while in phase 3 like healing or generator. put the map the game with the perk distresing and you are OP.
---
Now this....this puts a smile in my face
---
Right, that's why I said when the GAME screws up. The killer playing good is a terrible reason.
---
I also don't understand people who DC right at the end of the game. Like last night, I downed someone who would be dead on hook, and they DC'd. But this was the end of the game (literally, the gens were finished right after I downed them). What's the point of that? They play almost the entire game, then just throw away their bloodpoints. And I still get points for them DCing, so it's not punishing me, either.
---
Guys you heard it hear first Clown isn‚Äôt an absolute joke of a killer
---
ily OP ur adorable
---
It's a stupid fad.
---
Unless you want the skin do not prestige its pointless
---
If the killer is trash, I suspect it. Only trash players use it. They use it because they are so incompetent that they can't get kills without it.
---
Is this the pebble buff?
---
UnPoPuLaR OpInIoN
---
Ok coomer
---
I didn't play spirit on ptb so I won't comment there.  
---
Demo however got a big nerf right after ptb.   Used to be able to detect survivors while traveling upside down, cancel your travel, and the leap was faster with a smaller cooldown.   Devs nerfed all that. Then had to give a quick pallet break buff when they realized the over nerfed.
---
Unfortunately :/
---
Of you think hillbilly and iri huntress are close in balance you have to be rank 12 at max
---
Well if there is a serious balancing issue, it will become apparent quickly, I‚Äòd also rather say to get stuff out a bit weak than a bit too strong since buffs are a lot easier and generally feel more positive than nerfs.
---
Cute and funny
---
I just made it on discord
---
It's a low effort meme
---
Not a repost
---
Unironically complaining about No Mither...
---
Our sub is a parody now.
---
Big pogs
---
&gt;make your power deplete faster when using it
---
I even made this suggestion, but then I realized it **already does**.
---
Oh I see, you read the first line and said "that's all I need". Guess who Just prove my point?
---
Oh boy I sure do love taking long strolls through the forest at night in my sandals. Wait, what's this generator doing out here
---
That's my biggest gripe about the PTB environment in general. Not that it exists (It's good to figure out major bugs prior to release) but that nobody wants to actually learn about playing AROUND or adapting to new perk mechanic and Killers for any really decent amount of time before they come to some concrete conclusion on how trash or OP something is.
---
Pls kill me
---
Not necessarily. Imitating the survivor is pointless yes, but say an illusion that effects everyone.
---
Can you imagine the uproar if Hillbilly was a character released around now? Survs would absolutely lose their shit
---
Use PGTW, I‚Äôve gotten to rank 1 while cycling through every killer. Ruin gets taken out instantly anyway so why run it?
---
My new OTP
---
There's no way that flick is intended, it turns Oni into a heat seeking death missle.
---
Yeah, it's real. I guess the game decided that I wasn't worthy of a blackpip because the last person who decided not to leave got the hatch? Not my fault she spawned on the side of the map where it was while I was at the boat on Pale Rose.
---
Kate - cutie pie
---
No mend timer is applied
---
Dream big my friend dream big
---
is this a /s? if not what the fuck is wrong with you
---
Have you seen the No Mither sabo Build??? Where a killer literally can‚Äôt get a hook because they keep breaking hooks in front of them and you can‚Äôt slug people because they have no mither??? There‚Äôs literally full videos on this showing how oppressive it is but yeah just ignore my point and literally just not address the anti fun things survivors have
---
Naw he is out long enough he won't anymore.  Devs only care about changes early one while it still sells.  
---
Take a look at how long the Fredy change took.  They would rather focus time on new content not old.
---
yeah that is annoying but hey not my bloodpoint lmao
---
Now, why would blow this for the memes?
---
Not if you also have Remember Me and Blood Warden to buy extra time.
---
When they don't have even the slightest clue how to loop structures and just hold W until they Bloodlust you down. Guaranteed NOED gamers.
---
It's honestly sad how many people get to rank 1 playing like this.
---
Well I find Oni fun to verse. People dont find Doctor, Clown, Legion and Billy fun to verse either. What im saying is fun is subjective
---
It's like Christmas really. You get a pretty easy Ritual to complete, **AND** the ability to see the person's reaction in real-time or following the match.
---
This is interesting, considering every single post since yesterday has been *praising* Legion+Nemesis and I have yet to see a single complaint about it.
---
He's got alot more control of his charge as well, it's much harder to juke than a chainsaw.
---
Before I make any suggestions, (or assumptions) I need to play him myself (console scrub here lol)
---
Payday and Dead By Daylight we‚Äôre both published by Starbreeze, but they‚Äôve split with BHVR haven‚Äôt they W?
---
So the Pig chases down pigs?
---
It looks amazing! I love the neon effect and the details - it's so cool! 
---
I love her sm too! Can't wait to get her! üëÄüòÇ
---
Yeah....this is a weird list, man.
---
I notice you mention ‚Äúholding the game hostage‚Äù a few times. Like other people said, I definitely think the Jake was the asshole, but I just wanna be sure you know that two survivors hiding isn‚Äôt literally holding the game hostage in the reportable sense. You aren‚Äôt stopping anyone else from doing their objective/playing the game by hiding.
---
Huntress is generally considered slightly worse than Billy but nobody complains when they get caught in the open by him and get instadowned by his chainsaw.
---
Now that charms are a thing I feel like we should get those like ya know every other game with a rank system and charms do
---
It's a balance thing. It's done to slow down his pressure.
---
Frame rate and performance would probably be the big issue.
---
Yeah. I mean it's not wrong to also try to have fun but I thought the main purpose is to test and make any changes before main release right? Hence PTB.
---
Didn‚Äôt know Orion was in DBD.
---
this and when you stare that mf in the eyes and you don‚Äôt reveal him....both of these piss me tf off
---
Who TF DC's against a trapper
---
also dosen't help that not all the info in it is up to date
---
tried looking up addons for the med-kit earlier to find that they're all still the old versions of them
---
Nah nah I read the rest I‚Äôm just making fun of the Clown being powerful because godamn that‚Äôs funny but on another point THE KILLERS BEEN OUT FOR 2 DAYS god does every killer need a hot fix right out of PTB nowadays like come on and all the suggestions I‚Äôve heard make the killer less fun or straight up useless I‚Äôm not saying he doesn‚Äôt need tweaks but he doesn‚Äôt need flat nerfs ie make his power take longer to get but make him allowed to pick survivors up without losing his power
---
Yeah as most people said, many TTV are chill but I have met a small number of incredibly toxic TTVs that I enjoy using mori with.
---
At first I assumed you were a Spirit and I was gonna give them a pas for dcing, but you were a trapper lmao
---
The losses that hurt the most has been with Hag. She is seriously feast or famine.
---
Bully has so much more counterplay than iri huntress
---
Funny how times change. On release everyone was crying because it‚Äôs too hard to reveal him, and now here is the exact opposite.
---
Damn DbD community make up your mind!
---
Care to elaborate? 
---
The twitter argument really falls flat as they follow even Trump.
---
If you have an Xbox it's on gamepass
---
Seriously, I'd be thrilled if Freddies ran this build over the snoozefest that they do now.
---
So they can let other people think for them basically
---
I don't think there is nothing wrong with trying to have fun in PTB but OP is wrong for saying we are "whining and complaining" about the new killer.
---
\*sucks the dick\* \*Pennywise comes out a week later\*
---
Furtive chase a niche perk that is usable on like 2-3 killers
---
You playing SWF vs the SWF you face as killer...
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone besides Will Smith has, except maybe some super cool moms who are hip with the kids‚Äô lingo
---
But it doesn‚Äôt do that at all you know what it does it makes him slug if you want to play optimal and slugging ain‚Äôt that fun for either side also hooking people will slow your pressure a good amount and again make his power take longer to get in return
---
Another antimeme
---
The burn is real
---
My question was simply obscene. I am ashamed I even asked. üòî
---
I don't get it..please explain
---
With my build it's usable on almost any killer.
---
Steve. NANCY. Feng. Jeff. Yup!
---
To follow up to the previous guy, the reason these make wraith playable is that if you are right next to the survivor as you start your decloak, when you get out you can get a swing in as long as you lunge during the speed boost, so you don't feel like you have to chase, decloak, and Chase again.
---
Additionally, with windstorm, you're so fast while invis you can beat survivors to windows and pallets and bodyblock them in rare cases.
---
Susie clearly listens to Sandstorm on a loop
---
Weabs have always been rampant in DBD
---
I really, really, REALLY hope toxic survivors don't flock to her.   
---
She is so perfect and I love her, I don't want her to be tainted
---
It‚Äôs borderline undodgable as he can easily flick coming out of charge and the hit box of the attack is crazy. But even if he misses it he can just charge and do it again, and again, and again.
---
That 2 seconds could spell your doom if he marks you though. Just a thought.
---
For a second I wondered when I joined the For Honor sub reddit
---
&gt;but i can manage to juke the spirit most of the time by being at the right side of the pallet
---
You're still playing rock paper scissors with only 2 options.
---
Is that daft punk trapper???
---
&gt; And the best thing is that you don't run out of juice on your Obsession survivor either
---
Wait, is that a real mechanic as Michael? Or is that an effect of one of these add-ons? I thought your terror juice was split equally between the 4 survivors and when it's gone it's gone.
---
I can not describe how angry I am at myself for laughing at this gif
---
After they sell enough dlc's
---
The hitbox of the attack is long, not wide. And how excalty is that ANY different from Myers or Hillbilly? Oh wait, its NOT.
---
When there‚Äôs zero counterplay, then yes it‚Äôs op. It‚Äôs not fun to play against, and promotes tunneling one person until their timer runs out.
---
If fun was the gauge by which we judged killers, I would have yeeted Hag out ages ago. 
---
Can. Not. Stand. Hag. 
---
But a lot of people like her, and if I don't have fun that is on me, not the killer.
---
Not getting hit and not cleansing are two way different things.  If one survivor gets hit he gets his power if he follows hem, and then it‚Äôs a downward spiral from there.  Slugging and hitting more survivors with his insane speed and one shot power is such a powerful snowball ability.  Unbreakable is a counter but....  you can only use it once and how many people run unbreakable anyways.  And it‚Äôs not like he has 105% movement speed like tier one Myers who can have a lot of difficult getting out of tier one by a simple loop.  Looping him at Windows is tough because his insane flick.    One insta down with one charge of his ability is fine because that means 1 person is hooked and another is injured giving him orbs.
---
*laughs in Pyro*
---
He said he wondered how she taste, not in a sexual way, but in the sense that hes going to eat her like he eats baby goats
---
The first one just says ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù which is what it says ingame :&gt; i figured it wasn‚Äôt worth putting anything funny there because you wouldn‚Äôt be able to read it anyways
---
Then as an optimal survivor with DS, she should start to attract Myers attention because she‚Äôs already injured. Loop him for half a minute and gets downed then DS him and see how else to proceed while the rest of the team complete 80% of three separate gens. Game is over for the Myers.
---
Playing against ghostface: stares at him for like 10 seconds gets insta downed cause it didnt deactivate
---
Playing as ghostface: this post 
---
its almost as if were being punished?
---
They just need to make everything OP and see what happens.
---
To be honest I really want to try it, but you're right it's probably a bit strong
---
Fabulous Mama's
---
funnyn't'nt\*
---
Another repost.
---
Beautiful!
---
It‚Äôs not a guessing game guys... it‚Äôs an educated guessing game
---
Bruh what? That‚Äôs still guessing it doesn‚Äôt matter. Spirits aren‚Äôt robots who would do the same thing over and over or do everything perfectly. It‚Äôs a person, and people are unpredictable.
---
A bit, mate it would fucking break the game
---
&gt; I wish there was an easy way to search through your own comments
---
https://redditsearch.io/ Here
---
Why are they even friends with that person? Anyone who goes out of their way to harass or make fun of someone can go out of my life
---
Thank you!!
---
I FUCKING HATE HAVING A GOOD GAME UNTIL THE GATES OPEN AND PEOPLE START GETTING HOOKED. IT‚ÄôS FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU UNHOOK PEOPLE, TAG BEHIND THEM SO THEY EXIT THE GATES SAFELY, BUT WHEN YOU GET DOWNED AND THERE ARE SURVIVORS LEFT, THEY LEAVE???!!!!!?!!!
---
And why is that a problem?
---
Here‚Äôs my generic argument that‚Äôs completely satire: tRaPpEr Is AlReAdY tOo MuCh LiKe JaSoN
---
Unpopular opinion but couldn‚Äôt they just have removed the blood drips on the floor when deep wounds is active instead of dumpster firing a killer. Don‚Äôt get me wrong his shit was busted but Frank and crew didn‚Äôt deserve every nerf they got combined just some would have helped.
---
Poor Trapperman
---
He/she took it from there
---
U fokn wot
---
Yeah it's wild dude. You are just completely shit out of luck if he charges to you. You can't go around a corner or you get flicked on. Throw a pallet in his face and he breaks it. Maybe you get the stun, but how are you going to benefit from that? You leave the pallet and he charges you down. You try to loop it and he M1's it instantly and then charges you down.
---
The only possible counterplay is to take one for the team and jump into a locker so he has to lose his power, which isn't very fun for either of you.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
So because it's possible for survivors to complete 3 gens in 1:20, no killers can be overpowered?
---
Because it's shorter than "Kimura" I guess.
---
It sure would be annoying to play against
---
I have fun with every killer, only one I haven‚Äôt beaten yet is wraith but I‚Äôve only run into him once so idk how to judge that. I‚Äôm not sure why I don‚Äôt find any to be not fun but it could just be I haven‚Äôt run into that one killer that will anger me to no end
---
That doesn‚Äôt do anything. His hit reg is broken as shit, Look at this [video](https://youtu.be/DioP0OxLtQ0)  by Scott Jund, start at 5:28. The insane reach on the mallet hits him, there‚Äôs nothing he can do. You turn the corner, the killer sees the blood splotches and knows you‚Äôre around the corner. That‚Äôs not a counter. 
---
Further proof, look at this [video](https://youtu.be/4ZdDYDIEplc) by Fungoose, start on 52:01 and 54:40
---
No but saying this is op is over kill he‚Äôs not op
---
Which would be? Would he disguise himself as a gen?
---
Remember me isn't amazing after the nerf and moris dont trigger blood warden. Even finding your obsession (or getting nemesis to trigger) still requires you to chase them to get the down. If they aren't potatoes the rest will be fine.
---
The side that I play: good and opressed.
---
The side that I don't play: bad and the opressor.
---
.... I didnt say it works either, pal
---
*DONK*
---
Yeah his tracking abilities are broken and every killer has bs hits the hitboxes are ridiculous.
---
I don't know how you're arguing that this mechanic doesn't slow down his pressure. Slugging is always less pressure than a hook unless they're 10 seconds from bleeding out.
---
If he were able to hook then dash, he'd apply significantly more pressure.
---
It doesn't help that Billy has been busted since launch, but gets overlooked every patch.
---
Think it's more they wanna feel better about themselves than embarrass the killer
---
I'm sorry, I havent seen this exact meme used. Could you link me one?
---
perhaps side that you don‚Äôt play is not as bad as you purport
---
Where does Myers come in? He just has a good lunge and a one shot maybe 2-3 times a game max. The onis power comes much faster than his and is way better. And if you‚Äôve actually been reading the thread I‚Äôve mentioned it‚Äôs a major upgrade to Billy‚Äôs. He doesn‚Äôt have penalties for running into walls like billy, better mobility than billy, and if he misses the dash anyway he can just cancel it and one shot the survivor any way. So what‚Äôs your point?
---
Wait.. wasn't it r3 NM with "something something... you leave no  blood"? Or another perk?
---
Ash would beat ass as groovy as fucking possible. God love Bruce Campbell
---
Thank god for the dc penalties next update
---
You run past the pallet then he does too.... he‚Äôs faster than you in his charge and can run into obstacles freely
---
I had to stop using dead hard because of this, but i love the perk so I hope it‚Äôs going to be fixed soon. Using it early is the only thing you can really do but I personally can‚Äôt do it because muscle memory
---
Gotcha.  I only play private matches with my friends and we take turns being Jason.  It's way more fun.
---
Apparently freddy has many annoying forms, the one I meant was endgame freddy
---
You'll have to find them or search chests. Its really not that hard to find your teammates.
---
No one hooks in demon mode without slugging meaning he has over all more pressure because slugging gives a lot of pressure pressure ain‚Äôt how close they all to death it‚Äôs how hard it will be to get them back up
---
The chasing docter illusions sounds like a fun idea
---
Welcome to the Triple Digit IQ DBD Player Club. We have lots of extra badges and stickers if you want some.
---
owo Med-Kit
---
Exactly. Plus, Hillbilly is still worse to deal with. He can spam sprint and 1HKO for days.
---
The build where everyone wastes time saboing regenerable hooks?
---
such a scary build lol...
---
They follow a bunch of people on twitter, and I dont know anything about that dead game
---
which takes a long time, It's a perk that counters the current meta and that's a meta for a reason
---
I just want a way to let my teammates know if I'm being camped so they can just do generators and not waste time saving me. Then the killer and I will get 9k points and both depip but it will be worth it.
---
The altruistic survivor's without borrowed time annoy me most. Just do generators and get out and punish them for camping.
---
The point is if people are bitching about Oni's onshot then what about littrely every other one shot?
---
They dont stay forever. I've seen blood orbs dossappear right before my eyes.
---
You Destroy the Totem, You become the Totem
---
Imagine there are people out there that think cosplay is not a real world,ok bommer.
---
You dont need to immediatly drop the pallet against any of those
---
I couldn't find it but it's the exact same thing but instead of Yamaoka it's "Chapter"
---
i know it is, but that doesnt change that this person and so many other killers are crying about how survivor sided the devs are
---
I still wish Freddy wasn't visible to awake Survivors... An AEO sleep ability would've worked perfectly.
---
Takes too long with BoP yes, Nemesis on the other hand is darn effective.
---
If the devs dont patch it I can easily seep people with legion running Nemesis + Enduring + Spirit Fury.
---
I appreciate your kind words!  And you're right, making a youtube playlist and directly linking to it probably would have made way more sense than individually linking all the videos and probably getting my post shadow-banned for potential spam, but hindsight's 20/20 I suppose.
---
F for that pallet
---
DBD players are about the last people I would ask for balance feedback.
---
HAVE YOU SEEN THE VIDEOS they don‚Äôt fully sabo the hooks they sabo it to near broken and break it infront of the killer god I love the fact that you literally have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about and are sill trying to act like I‚Äôm wrong literally watch one video with this build and see how fucking anti fun it is I don‚Äôt care if gens don‚Äôt get done taht fast in this build because not being able to get a hook is a pretty big deal
---
There definitely does seem to be a large killer bias on this subreddit, but you definitely get a few anti-killer posts too.
---
Depends, angry spirit? No.
---
Some people swinging swords that I disapprove of? Y E S. YES. YES. YES.   Y    E   S!
---
I wasn't here for the first 2 and a half years, so I can't say anything. I didn't really start playing the game until Legion came out.   I've only heard about how bad it used to be for killer. Personally I don't mind them balancing both sides of the game more, but at the same time, I feel like they should be a bit faster to do it. (I guess that's just BHVR though.)
---
And to be fair with the survivor rule book, you could say the same thing for survivors having a rulebook for killers. Play like an asshole if you want against toxic four mans, but most peoole who play solo just want a fair chance to actually play the game, which is why we complain about proxy/ face camping, and tunneling. (Or at least, that's why I'll bitch about it a bit.) I get that it's easier to get a win if you do that stuff, but I just don't see how it can be fun for anyone involved. Same with ebony moris- just from playing both sides, I don't find them fun to play with, or against. To be fair too though, I've always considered it a rule in DBD to just treat others how you'd want to be treated, so when a killer starts tunneling me, or camping me for no apparent reason, I get frustrated. If I had been a little bitch and t-bagged at pallets? Fair enough. Face camp me Daddy. Am I your first and only down and we're in the EGC? Fair enough, live your life, it happens. Doing it for seemingly no reason besides I pallet stunned you once? Idk what you want from me. (To be fair, these aren't issues as bad on PC, especially in higher rank. I'm generally fine with purple to red rank PC killers. PS4 though has killers like this all the way up through the ladder though, and they're most of what you see. Idk why.)
---
[And now you're butt dancing. Very mature!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQuywxoFEFs&amp;t=207s)
---
Then why does any killer in this game ever hook?
---
Your implication that slugging causes more pressure than hooking is incorrect. There's not a single situation where i'd rather be hooked than slugged, unless I'm 10s from bleeding out or the last one and the killer is wasting my time.
---
When you play killer, do you just not hook people?
---
If you are not cleansing against plague, you are permanently exposed and has no way to exit chase due to the vomit sound. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a small disadvantage. Also, I am not saying avoiding hit ever, but delay it as much as possible. Even if you delay the hit for one minute, he is in deep shit. Tier 1 Myers has 40 meter range for stalking, and he has no heartbeat , you are a 115 speed 32 terror radius killer, with no range. There are pros and cons but against good survivors, it is definitely harder to get a hit as oni than get out of Myers tier1. Also, if you just get one insta down per power, you are strictly worse than Myers, who isn‚Äôt a top tier killer either.
---
Just like launch Freddy was OP?? LMAO.
---
Sarcasm maybe xd but what do i know ü§£
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure you get the Spirit with switch
---
Rancor specifically states that it becomes active after the last gen is completed iirc
---
That‚Äôs a perk called fixated. It‚Äôs icon is the footsteps. The power is to increase 20% walking speed while I injured and the ability to see your own scratch marks.
---
I'm justifying just running a perk to punish survivors who just gen''rush'', yeah yeah I know it's not a thing, but you understand what I'm saying.    
---
Also, don't be such a salty survivor main, it's a meme.
---
When you level up Sloppy Butcher to lvl 300
---
Every game I've watched or played as Oni have ended in the same result He is super consistent at his job and his power is really easy to gain after a minute in the game. Loops aren't enough since he can flick around tiles.  Once he slugs his first survivor and starts dash patrolling, he'll take out the team in mere seconds no matter what tile or position the survivor is on the map. I love Oni, but he needs a serious look at before release.
---
It would be super annoying but there‚Äôs counter plays to it and it takes ages to get a down. It‚Äôs not overpowered at all. It‚Äôs just obnoxious to play against.
---
Was he toxic in endgame chat?
---
Ah yes, the military mindset. An environment more toxic than the worst DBD post chat.
---
Source: USMC Vet
---
well, i agree, but it‚Äôs really unfortunate that whenever i get camped my teammates are urban evasion-ing around the map but when someone on my team is camped we all become 400 iq gen jockeys.
---
i try to help camping, that‚Äôs why i bring borrowed time occasionally but tbh no one wants to get killed trying. 
---
i always hold out so that my team can finish some gens (if they aren‚Äôt what i mentioned above) but it‚Äôs really dumb to see that i de-pipped and all of reddit is defending this ‚Äústrategy.‚Äù
---
Oh what? I had no idea that existed, whoops
---
Come on OP tag this NSFW you killed that poor lad.
---
Yes but my PS4 pro is no match to the guys 6,000 dollar that can perform at the max or everything without breaking.
---
I see adorable art with Feng Min, I upvote. More please!
---
anti fun for you. I enjoy chasing and hitting people, which is much more effective when they're always one hit down and always wasting time saboing. I don't really actively enjoy setting someone on a hook, though. It's a quick time event that you just click a button for.
---
This build is not impossible to win against or even do well against. Killers can often be one track minded though, and because they couldn't spacebar someone onto a hook, they panic and crumble.
---
The core issue is that you don‚Äôt know as a solo survivor how many totems were done so it‚Äôs just a guessing game. A SWF team makes your NOED useless under 5 minutes whereas it fucks you over when you‚Äôre solo.
---
You still cute /u/Peanits
---
The only thing I want to change in the Oni, is to increase his Terror Radius while in Blood Fury, because i'ts almost impossible to react in time when he is going straight to you, and also make his Club Attack from Blood Fury easier, because it feels hard to use it.
---
And if they do gens normally and didn‚Äôt gen rush they still deserve to be punished?
---
This is a really good idea. Sadly it means it's never going to materialize. :)
---
You forgot to blank out the names in chat in the second image
---
Yes, that's something I forgot to add. That your ranked with people your rank. However, I believe one rank over should match as well. For example, red can match with purple. Purple can match with red or green. etc.
---
Unironically. I'm sick of that annoying scrotum-face. I love how Leathface is a joke, while the store-brand version is utterly broken.
---
Frosty eyes.
---
Ok, memes aside, usually if its an M1 killer and they didn't run Ruin I assume they have NOED.
---
But billy is faster and can do it at any time? If something is "op" (which i don't think there is with oni) it's certainly not his dash.
---
My editing skillz are so mediocre, its great :')

The funny thing is I already know what that last panel is since I'm a regular visitor of r/dbdgonewild

Yes in specific scenarios slugging is used to apply more pressure, but if you do this against survivors that aren't hyperimmersed crouching in corners, you'll be punished for it. You cannot effectively apply pressure if people aren't going to die.
---
Try killer and never hook people. It'll be a nice meme until about rank 13.
---
We know its porn.
---
Basically how devs balance legion
---
I agree that it's anti fun, but just being a Mori of you see 4 toolboxes?
---
If they try to loop you in a structure use your ability. It takes away any knowledge of your location.
---
I like discordance on him
---
So constantly getting stunned and not being able to do objectives is fun? Also you just invalidated the biggest reason against all these people saying killers and killers perks are bad because they are anti fun also I think your the only person who thinks the build isn‚Äôt the super irritating it‚Äôs literally made to make the game less fun also tell me the way you can get hooks against this build because the only way to actually beat it is make everyone bleed out and that takes forever you can‚Äôt slug because everyone has no mither and if survivor do the build right you can‚Äôt make it to a hook before it‚Äôs broken I didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs unbeatable but the way you beat it is unfun and boring
---
I was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on FB with a guy from high school that was the ultimate contrarian. He just always absolutely had to question anyone‚Äôs post or had something negative to say.
---
I eventually got fed up with his vibes and deleted him.
---
Why did I thought it was a RWBY comic at first but then I saw Haunter Grounds and was more confused
---
That's a big chunk of the people in this sub tbh. Everyone drones on and on about how survivors are not entitled to escape, but they all forget they're not entitled to 4k. It goes both ways.
---
I once looped a Ghostface for like 30 seconds, and he facecamped me while smacking me on hook and nodding, and then messaged me after calling me trash. Shitty people are gonna be shitty no matter what, it isn't specific to your preferred role in a video game.
---
looks absolutely amazing
---
The game is called dead by daylight. It's not supposed to be easy
---
Preface: I do not condone tunneling. It takes the fun out of the game in most cases. 
---
We can‚Äôt really fault killers for going after the weaker prey. A healed survivor who wants to be chased vs a hurt survivor who doesn‚Äôt is the obvious choice. 
---
That said, generally if a survivor is actively trying to get the killer‚Äôs attention then it‚Äôs smarter to ignore them, especially in a chase. This can be for a lot of reasons but the two I see commonly:
---
-Your current prey is a weaker player
---
-The ‚Äòhelpful‚Äô teammate is an aggressive player that wants me to chase them and sink my time. 
---
Until at least 1 survivor is out of the game I am more likely to take the weaker prey or the first person I find.
---
Just from the dc challenge? Yea.
---
do bones lol
---
Oh yes my bad but the aura is always white
---
The DCs look worse considering you were running add ons that should be apart of trapper‚Äôs base kit in the first place...
---
They don't work together. Otz already tried it out and it's a no go.
---
They're the kill (survivor name) by your own hands rituals
---
NoT tHe NaVy!
---
But they didn‚Äôt all leave: one was killed and one escaped.
---
ignore the haters lol congrats on a perfect game!! i‚Äôve yet to achieve such a feat...one day tho....
---
I don‚Äôt like moris they are again unfun to me and the survivors it‚Äôs literally just takes away a big chunk of the game also I hate this mentality ‚Äújust bring a perk/add on to counter this build‚Äù I remember how mad people got when we said that for Spirit you shouldn‚Äôt need to bring something that you have are actively dislike to a game to win it and I remember the biggest brain argument was just bring Hangman‚Äôs trick oh you mean the worst godamn perk in the game
---
it‚Äôs perfect!
---
Moris are best when the victim is recording and broadcasting it over the internet!
---
I play both sides and I hate the side I don‚Äôt play atm so much.
---
So you‚Äôre saying he failed his vibe check?
---
Pepaga
---
this is so amazing!
---
Not if you hit someone down the another in quick succession the fact that the Oni is basically forced to slug (when slugging is unfun for both sides) is stupid
---
Can u at last wait for him to go live before complaining, wait for more ppl to play him
---
Or Head On. xD
---
I want more of this comic, I love this
---
It just really isnt tho
---
I agree he needs to be looked at........but not in that regard
---
Where did you get the idea that I don‚Äôt hook people? Because I say hooking people on a guy who gets punished for it is kinda a bad idea
---
Interestingly enough, if you as a killer spend time defending your totems, you will very likely fail to defend 5 gens, thus the need for a crutch perk
---
Its a fucking screenshot of a facebook post, OP did nothing that warrants credit
---
The blood points would be really nice for new players though, and it would keep older players stacked up for when a new killer/survivor is released. It's just a small touch that would be appreciated, and actually make rank a little more important.
---
right, i play both but not as much killer (i‚Äôd like to but i‚Äôm switching platforms &amp; just existing as killer is so hard on my iri shards) and it‚Äôs like being on both sides of the war.
---
My disappointment stems from what I see as significant nerfs and baseless changes. I hate all of Nurse's add ons, excluding Jenner's Last Breath and both charge speed add ons. I don't play Nurse to become a 115% movement killer and I don't play her to not blink through walls. I play her because I find it exhilarating to get those blink hits and correctly predicting where survivors go. My favorite add ons for one of the best killers in the game shouldn't be for being able to use their power, it should be for new and interesting ways to play her. That's why I'm disappointed with her. I agree that Omega blink and 5 blink needed to go, but that doesn't mean I agree with anything that has been put in place. Why couldn't they make more of her add ons like Jenner's Last Breath? Dude, immediately blinking back to your previous position is awesome! That is an outstanding new way to use her power. So much potential for mind-gaming and whatnot.  
---
My whole post started with Myers' add ons as an example for a reason. I want to see other killers have what he has. That's the whole point. He has strong stuff to throw in and that's what I want to see with everyone.
---
And yeah, I don't really care much about the prayer beads change anyway. I liked it for my totem builds because I thought it was fun to just yoink everybody off totems all the time. I only mentioned it because they're changing her collision mechanics and I find it unnecessary.
---
I'm really glad that you find enjoyment in most of the recent changes by the devs, and I agree, they can't please everyone. I suppose most of my frustration is they roll out a lot of changes at once instead of tweaking some numbers here and there. 
---
Good luck to you, too!
---
If you don't know how he works and you state yourself that it is not op, then why the fuck are you calling for a nerf?
---
This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen lol
---
The reason for him losing his ability after picking someone up is to stop his pressure also I was quoting the original commenter
---
Why? 
---
Is it cuz you can't handle the traps shutting down loops or is it just cuz everyone and their sister is playing Trapper because of the Archives?
---
Forever Freddy still needs a lead to snowball off of so...just deny him that lead and ur fine.
---
Same here lol.
---
Ah yeah makes sense actually. I completely forgot about those...
---
the navy is the real miltary though, you "roast" is not analogous
---
The clown, trapper and doctor ones above all else imo. They are my favorites to play. The auto reload for clown would be awesome.
---
The problem with that combo is that Nemesis makes it so you're pretty much always chasing the Obsession. It's going to be really hard to get DL stacks unless you respect every pallet, which is problematic in itself.
---
Nah tombstone. You run nemesis, PWYF, ruin, whispers/discordance with tombstone and the journal. They pallet stun you, you drain them of juice and tombstone them. All the while, you keep PWYF stacks and keep draining the obsession‚Äôs juice
---
Happens to me maybe 1/10 games on Xbox.
---
Hacks /s
---
Yeah man either don't use pallets or just waste them all and toss them immediately.  CoUnTeRpLaY
---
Stop dcing just because you don‚Äôt like playing against certain killers.
---
True. It's not uncounterable by any means but it is very strong. Plus, dropping pallets early just got a hell of a lot more viable with the new survivor perk.
---
Get absolutely destroyed
---
I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO DELETE MY USELESS OFFERINGS!! NO I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE MEAT PACKING PLANT!
---
RIP Hollow Shell.
---
It‚Äôs a 100% guaranteed down after a pallet stun...
---
We need a new wiki
---
They're weird too
---
Short answer: legion gets to be old Legion again, mikey gets stupid fast stalks. Read the other comments for the long answer.
---
There are tons of LGBT suicides every year Bc people struggle to accept themselves because society nonstop focuses the conversation on only straight people. Your joke sucks.
---
why the fuck did you waste a pallet
---
Why is that?
---
Now It's my turn to say that I think you didn't unerstand. Im not talking about the Yamaoka thing, I'm talking about the Fresh Prince of Bel Air meme always including The Spirit in some way, like "When you buy chapter x, but accidentally buys Shattered Bloodline" It's not the first time.
---
What kind of Myers runs 3 Hex perks, 1 of which is redundant since he has 1-hit downs already.
---
Except SF Enduring does 1 HS of damage after a pallet break and it takes two breaks to proc. Dropping the pallet sooner is not counterplay against Nemesis Legion.
---
"Missed a charge" ??? The charge itself isnt an attack, you can chain the charge into an attack, which you can indeed miss and there is a cooldown
---
It was ages ago, but I‚Äôve seen the same post, not just the same format.
---
Ah, I see. My bad.
---
Not even only the strike, his normal M1 has insane range
---
Woops I actually was thinking in the wrong perk, I was thinking about Nemesis + Dark devotion.
---
Get a new obsession, hit them hen run off while silent.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people think survivors have already won when 5 gens are completed. When 1-2 kills happens after 5 gens in many cases regardless of having noed or not. End game is a legit part of the game and there are a lot of perks from both sides that are related to this part of the game. A close game between equally skilled killers and survivors should go to end game and the killer should have the chance to get additional kills during that period. Noed just sacrifice early game to significantly increase the chance of getting kills during end game. It is a strategy to emphasize on one stage of the game rather than another. There‚Äôs no difference between using stalling perks to slow down the gens stage and kill more during that period, using chase perks to kill faster even though the game progress faster, and using 3 perks during early game but kill more during end game stage, as long as they help you win.
---
It is arguable if NOED is overpowered, but that‚Äôs a different topic. I just disagree with the mind set that ‚ÄúNOED rewards losing‚Äù, because you literally haven‚Äôt loss yet at the point NOED is activated. It‚Äôs like saying preserving your energy during a marathon is a strategy that ‚Äúrewards losing‚Äù the first half of the race.
---
me too! rarely have I been using his power. I prefer the hack and slash haha ill keep these in mind.
---
So a male feminist even worse
---
TFW leather face is the store brand :(( 
---
(Usage wise)
---
Noed is not the problem. 
---
It's the community pretending to have it's own rules.
---
if he pussies out i gotchu bro
---
what add ons do you run?
---
But it's always night , oh god oh fuck
---
Because this is an original post.
---
Whoosh
---
If you check OPs post history you'll find out that it's exactly what you thought it was lol
---
Jokes on you he's gay LOL
---
The one who died immediately suicided on hook within the first 60 seconds of the game, so I consider that a DC with extra steps. The guy who escaped was presumably either the one solo queuer or didnt feel like losing 2 pips over a lost cause, so I gave him hatch out of pity.
---
I really think Oni just needs cooldiwn after dash because being able to dash up with no drawback is dumb strong.
---
That JonTron? Man, fuck JonTron.
---
Power recovery like chewed pen and detection/crouched speed addons
---
Yeah, the Clown is fun but he just has no staying power.  I figure this way you‚Äôd never be stuck in a chase without your power but still can‚Äôt just spam it.
---
he was running scratched mirror :\^)
---
Yeah I was watching sammymjay literally earlier and I was shocked to hear him say camping and tunnelling are valid strategies and then after some deep deep soul searching and after what you said I was like damn it really is a valid strategy *sometimes* and *sometimes* it's the only thing they can do, lord knows if i was versus a slimey swf who were on some flashlight shit I'd camp them within an inch of their life, it goes both ways. But like I said earlier hardcore tunnels and camping are the bane of any game. I'd much rather be salty over being schooled by a killer who went to hunt etc than a killer who camped me out of a 2 minute long game.
---
No it's a survivor teabagging can't you see?
---
But you get a free hit in for BP, and they get BP for escaping. It's a win-win.
---
not always
---
Maybe survivors could have limited blood too? Like Myers in a sense.
---
I can‚Äôt wait until she comes out. She‚Äôs such a cool character, I might main her
---
To the real military?
---
^I'm really sorry, I had to
---
thank you!! i do! but i dont know if its against the rules to advertise that on this subreddit
---
His attack cooldown is the same length as it takes to hop out the locker. He can just M1 after
---
NOED is only infuriating when your team has really struggled and clawed their way through 5 gens despite the killer kicking their ass the entire time only to get hit by NOED.
---
Like the type of match where taking the time to track down and cleanse all 5 totems would cost you the game anyway.
---
Just feels bad. On average/bad killers it's a fine crutch perk tbh, don't really care if they use it.
---
The whole point of the PTB is for players to show what needs to be fixed, I don‚Äôt mean nerfed but he‚Äôs too strong against most casual player survivors right now. Even though he is extremely fun to play as he‚Äôs honestly not that fun to play against, especially if you can‚Äôt even run to a pallet before being demolished. People are trying to figure out a balance to keep him the same but add a little but more counter.
---
Yeah she‚Äôs the survivor from the new chapter.
---
Only trash survivors use exhaustion perks or DS. They can‚Äôt escape without them.
---
I respect your wrong opinion.
---
watch me be the first person to flame someone post chat because they fucked me up as Oni but I'd do that for any killer. Killers are fine depends how bad/ good they're played. You can't say Hag is OP for example cos she whooped your ass one game but in your game time you've won against countless hags.
---
A wool beret with buff ball
---
Oni, and more specifically his perks, are literally going to break the game. Blood Echoes is one of the most busted perks I've ever seen, especially if you run it on a killer like Plague or Legion where you're injured most of the game. Why the devs thought it was fine for a killer perk to trigger the exhausted debuff, while also nerfing an exhaustion perk, would be a good idea is beyond me.
---
I‚Äôm sure a lot of players don‚Äôt even have the character and that percentage accounts for all players not just active players
---
Mindgame 100
---
Combo Nemesis, Rancor, and furtive chase all together and try to eat DS's at the end game and you can feasibly Mori everyone.
---
It will be hard to pull off since it is end game, but does sound fun to try
---
The worst is when they put "salty surv cry cry :(" like I wasn't crying but a bitch just might if you keep up this cockroach behaviour
---
I name this piece: "birth of a blendette"
---
Come on man he‚Äôs obviously more countered by Windows 8, and if you can‚Äôt see that you should be forced to use Windows 9.
---
Looks great up until the point where the survivors start showing I'd recommend having the fire in the middle so the amount of survivors don't look as awkward :)
---
Maybe because people aren‚Äôt a hive-mind? I main GF and have had survivors break me out without looking at me and have gotten free downs because they‚Äôre trying to break me out. The devs should make it more consistent but it‚Äôs not a priority right now.
---
The only killer fun for the survivors is ghostface of the ptb, that cant be an argument to nerf or change  a killer
---
Fungoose is a killer main that‚Äôs far better than TRU3 yet he also agreed Spirit was bullshit
---
Achievements track everyone who played the game even once during the entire time it exists. Which means the "playerbase" is huge, and consists of thousands of inactive people who quit or never even played properly.
---
Couple that with the fact that Ghostface isn¬¥t really a very attractive character to buy if you aren¬¥t hardcore, and it is definitely believable.
---
She needs some tweaks on her face, but she's definetely going into my roster. She won't take over Feng's place in my heart tho, oh no
---
The military is just a cosplay that kills innocent brown people
---
I said Myers would be strictly better if Oni only get one insta down per power. Myers can down one person, hook him, and still maintain map pressure for the rest of his power, because people cannot do risky gens or risky hook saves during that period. But if you cannot get away from oni so you force him to grab you, either by going into a locker or having unbreakable etc. He lost his power and pressure immediately. It is true that oni gets his power back faster in most cases, and is easier to down people during his power, but Myers also have the advantage of a 16 meter heartbeat along with 1.15 movement speed at all time. Over all I do think Oni is a better killer than Myers, but moderately better than Myers is not op. I don‚Äôt think he is as strong as spirit, Freddy, nurse or hillbilly, especially against good survivors who don‚Äôt give their first hit for free.
---
I agree with you because I played the game before it got its buff to make it what it is now and for them to nerf the perk that they thought needed a buff because it wasn‚Äôt really viable when you still had the fall stagger is just stupid and I‚Äôm pretty sure even killer players will agree that nerfing a perk for having easily fixable infinites on 4 maps is just unreasonable and it‚Äôs proof that these are the worst game devs ever
---
Sorry but even as a killer main this is fucking stupid.
---
Defending totems is not the priority. Defending gens is the priority.
---
If you see totems as a high rpiority then you are a fucking idiot.
---
Fungoose is a far better survivor and killer than TRU3 who has also talked about how old Spirit is bullshit
---
They will. FFS, she has a perk that lets you reset pallets. Another perk that boosts people's wiggle timers. She was built to grief killers.
---
Happened to me the other day. 4 games in a row like that. I finally just gave up. I haven't had any problems today. Yet...
---
I'm not saying it's ideal, I'm saying there is a way to deal with it. If the survivors want to do that, then they deserve the Mori. If you get in game and they're not, then just don't use the Mori. It's a problem, but not countering it because you refuse to even the playing ground isn't the point.
---
Ideally you wouldn't have to, but you do. So that's how you handle it until they fix it. "x is broken so y should be broken" is not good design.
---
Also, I don't think you need to counter survivor perks most of the time.
---
It works with Decisive Strike but not with Furtive Chase.
---
This would be a handy reminder if all you had to go off of was the beta trailer/footage from way back since Meg was black and Claudette was white in those.
---
That is true I didn't really think about those players
---
Every single definition i could find of too much stated that it was negative.
---
You would've think that devs were to discourage slugging rather than making a killer power that straight up forces you to do it to get the most out of it.
---
I had multiple people insta DC against me as The Clown yesterday. Shit is bizarre. I get the Spirit but anyone else is stupid.
---
I wonder why they are so against giving trapper all his traps ok by default why don't they just test this out in a PTB and if it looks too good nerf it a bit ? Literally I wish they could test more stuff out on the PTB so we can see good changes.
---
*Orgasms in Jane Romero*
---
Or maybe they suicide because you keep painting them and treating like victims instead of just allowing them to be treated equally. For example, you can't just grab two people and yell at them to become friends. Instead, let them make their own friends and let them understand each other instead of forcing them to like each other. For me personally, I am a straight male, but I have no problem with anyone being gay or transgender,etc. They can do whatever they want with themselves and I have no problem with it. UNTIL, they start getting in my face and start forcing their ideas on me and most especially start painting me as the bad guy for an innocent joke.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think they really looked at the other killers before making Nemesis cause sure it‚Äôs fine on the Oni but the way it affects other killers like Legion or Myers seems to have been overlookedüòÇ
---
But you can avoid pallet stun by drop the pallet earlier? You drop pallets earlier against spirit and huntress as well.
---
Damage output so high even Bubba feels ashamed
---
Sometimes, to burn someone, you have to throw em into a volcano.
---
Dude I agree, it felt off and that drove me crazy. So was wondering the same do you guys feel the same let me know.
---
Youre really putting way too much fear into this. No one owns a 6000 dollar gaming PC. Gaming PC's can be as little as 500 and run this game just as well as a console. And this game the PC vs console issue really isnt that big and wouldn't be an issue. I dont think it gives any advantage at all in the survivor play and maybe a slight advantage in some killers like nurse to PC but honestly there's some good console nurses out there too.
---
This crossplay bullshit of PC will destroy is do blown out of proportion its ridiculous. I bet your ps4 pro runs the game better than some peoples PC.
---
Don't you know?  Language stopped evolving in the 50s and every word popularized since then is just Entitled Youth Speak for people who are too dumb to use Real English.
---
If it's a different format it's not a repost then lol
---
I'm not a real word.
---
If they were treated equally you would have put them in the joke. Also, are you gay? No? Okay then your opinion doesn‚Äôt really count considering you‚Äôve never experienced it dude
---
this same meme was posted quite a bit when the Stranger Things chapter came out. the general joke was someone buying the wrong chapter in store.
---
I mean maybe. I‚Äôm not sure still. I‚Äôm guessing you play on pc.
---
Depends on what noise you're talking about. You still make noise, just that specifically pain noise is muted. You still scream, make footstep sounds, and fall noises and grunts.
---
Another possibility is if the killer has Stridor then you will still make pain grunts even with Iron Will.
---
I play both survivor and killer and from what I can get is that noed means either you don't have ruin or you know that you're gonna get beat because of the better survivor team so you take an insane end game perk, I'd understand using it without ruin or with blood Warden but nothing else tbh
---
I expect nothing less then a news annoucement stating they will ban people for using the combo in the game like they did with the blade bug.
---
I just find it funny that all the overpowered and crutch perks and strategies are the norm in Identity v XDDD
---
Yeah
---
Will there be video proof ü§î
---
naa, they should buff him in some aspects and nerf him in others.
---
my changes:
---
nerf: the recharge addons
---
buff: when he pick up someone, his power is not gone, and it gets paused.
---
All that crust from them fingers he‚Äôs been sucking
---
IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJO REFERENCE?!
---
Oni nerf: we made him shorter
---
Exactly it takes you off gens and stops you from gen rushing ohhhh the horror
---
I appreciate you
---
I actually really like your idea. It would make sense as to why killers like Doctor, Huntress or Legion possess no magical powers because they were already willing to kill without the need for outside forces
---
Removed -Ctedit not given to original poster
---
Btw do you main bill? (No offense lol)
---
You said ‚Äúshe is a girl and this is a win-win situation for her.‚Äù What if a young girl who‚Äôs struggling to accept that she doesn‚Äôt like dick sees that and makes her feel worse about herself? Thank you for being an ally, but you‚Äôre posting something that is more damaging that you‚Äôre aware of
---
Yes you‚Äôll keep your current level when you buy the pass and get all rewards up to that point
---
You don‚Äôt drop pallets early to Huntress if you‚Äôre smart. Dropping pallets early for her is exactly what she wants. Spirit is different as she chases players completely differently from other killers in every single aspect. Legion can still chase someone like an M1 killer whilst ALSO having a guaranteed instadown. Stop defending a blatantly broken exploit.
---
I wonder what your favorite part of this comic is, hmmmmm
---
Ive stuck with Jake Park since the beginning
---
Because they are we have only 3 viable killers at rank 1
---
Maybe do bones next time.
---
Although I agree with NOED being a safety net. I feel like I only ever see it on rank reset, and is normally used by killers who seem inexperienced. Personally, I have not used it in forever as I just do not feel it's as impactful as other perks.
---
He's a suggestion. Remove ranks. Problem solved. Win some, lose some.
---
Damn straight.
---
How‚Äôs the boot taste?
---
So you're the one Kate at the bar?
---
he really does need a cooldown after ending his dash and I think that would be enough, maybe reduce his capability of hitting through windows since his weapon literally clips through walls when he hits survivors far from the windows. I like his ability of steering + not cancelling his dash when bumping and flicking, most structures have safe places from his charge but you need to be mindful of where he is comming from and this actually creates interesting gameplay instead of usual loops
---
maybe change his blood orbs to have diminishing returns when stacked together, so you can't get 100% charge from one survivor that was self-caring/doing a gen/clensing?
---
Person in green was fishing for a crumb of pussy
---
Perfect change tbh.
---
Wait, can you transfer progress from consoles and pc?
---
Juat look at a wall or bait the save
---
the best part of the ptb, you can get stuck on everything now as both survivor and killer
---
Billy can use his thing when ever he wants
---
It already was used for Stranger Things
---
I main Samurai Jake
---
You definitely face camped the guy on hook, look at that medal.
---
GOD! That last sound effect from the EGC really got me.
---
Jeff - bum
---
I really like the "bruh moment" shirt ngl
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that getting the guaranteed requires literally zero skill. All you have to do is barely monitor the stabbed survivor so that they don‚Äôt mend. Is it completely OP, no. Is it brainless, counterless and absolutely game breaking? 100%.
---
Yeah no this guy literally has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about
---
&gt;So constantly getting stunned and not being able to do objectives is fun?
---
You can still kill them, you just can't hook them.
---
&gt;I think your the only person who thinks the build isn‚Äôt the super irritating
---
You think I'm the only person who plays dead by daylight that isn't worried about no mither? How about the other people who laughed at the first comment along with me?
---
&gt; it‚Äôs literally made to make the game less fun
---
You think the devs purposefully add things that are unfun?
---
&gt;but the way you beat it is unfun and boring
---
I'd disagree.
---
Peter sees better without his glasses, so the meme is accidently correct lol.
---
Oh I was thinking the David in the bush
---
Nope that would kill him
---
I love this meme, but it loses a lil bit of its special sauce every repost
---
damn he got his nuts cut without any reason
---
By boot do you mean the long dick of Uncle Sam? It was coo ish...mostly...sometimes. I mean I do miss biscuits and creamed beef doe
---
We hate him because he‚Äôs a dumbass
---
I misunderstood you, my mistake.
---
Yeah. So a solid 2/3s of the show. With star court being only in season 3 and probably not even in season 4 at all
---
He is just another good thing about the whole comic
---
You fucking loop him just like every other killer that‚Äôs your counter play
---
Corn fucked my wife while I was at work:(
---
Why do you go to full health on hook when adrenaline activates? The world may never know.
---
I know it man, that shit is always terrifying. Noed is one scary perk. Luckily I don't see it to often.
---
He can't turn as fast. Take tight turns and he will have trouble
---
Or. 
---
No.
---
It's mental trauma.
---
Plague, still never saw one tho ive been playing again for 2 months now about an hour a day
---
Because anyone fighting against your point plays on pc..... makes sense.
---
His counter play is looping
---
What exacly he said was wrong? Oni is shit until you hit someone, then you can snowball and have little to no counter play, can you point out where it's wrong?
---
Yes :)
---
Steal someone else's meme that's the spirit!
---
Just don't pallet stun and then the perk is worthless. Thrown out early and try to jump the Legion when they're in the vault animation 
---
(Mind you, this isn't a good solution for several reasons, IE that one Legion addon that destroys pallets.  But it is a solution.)
---
Not their choice.
---
It's the choice of the license holders.
---
For context, we were playing against Freddy &amp; I got unhooked by someone &amp; found this Steve &amp; he was asleep so I tried to wake him but he kept running &amp; fast vaulting away from me. He didn't try to heal me so I got frustrated &amp; just let the killer hook me so I could die sooner.
---
So basically you do things slightly faster, which is good for injuring people, but you only want to use it on healthy people, but only if there's more than one, which you can't tell until you activate your power, which is stupid
---
I love how you ignored my point LETTING PEOPLE BLEED OUT ISNT WINNING you again he no BP and you De Pip the main pony of this game is to gee hooks and kill survivors quick but nope slugging survivors who will just stand up later and survive for a couple more minutes until they get downed and lose a tiny bit of their bleed out bar and boom they are back up rinse and repeat and BOOM your stuck in the game not able to hook them to get rid of them faster and the survivors are taking the game hostage basically and guess what stopping to sabo a hook isnt gonna stop gens in there tracks yeah gens May take a slight bit longer but that doesn‚Äôt matter when you can‚Äôt gee hooks you are actually defending a build that makes it impossible to do you objective as killer like what?
---
We still don't know if its a bug or not since kindreds description states "Trumps all killers stealth abilitys" but since the undetectable addition it trumps kindred. They did update kindred and i haven't checked the PTB description but it still works the new way so it may be intended.
---
Wearing a cloak vs literal new model from a franchise
---
His devotion is strong.
---
Ogres are like onions.
---
Kindred won‚Äôt reveal Insidious anymore. However there‚Äôll still be a few seconds until your terror radius disappears where you‚Äôll clearly be standing still and not moving which will make it obvious what you‚Äôre doing.
---
I hope we get something for freddy! I think every other killer has skins now. I might be missing someone though.
---
Same reason that the Stranger Things achievements have low percentages.
---
It tracks the percentage of all players ever, and those achievements were added recently
---
**FLOSS LIKE A BOSS**
---
Pfff, like these changes are gonna make him weaker. If anything he‚Äôll be even more overpowered
---
U did it way too early fam u gotta do it when the picking up animation is done and the killer can move again
---
Sobs in agreement. 
---
This totem also has a D/C effect when I solo que
---
That was nice. When people DC I always feel bad for the ones still in the match, and usually just let them escape. Their teammates already destroyed what was supposed to be a good game.
---
Yeah some people seem to be forgetting he's a 32m terror radius killer with NO POWER at the beginning of the game. IMO that's the worst possible early game you can have.
---
&gt; YOU WIN BY SACRIFICING bleeding out isn‚Äôt winning at all you again get no points and you de pip
---
The first part is false, you don't get 0 points on a bleedout.
---
The second part, you de pipping, is wholly a personal problem. It would be incredibly easy to at least safety pip in a game like this
---
Damn I feel like I would've appreciated this more if I hadn't seen so many similar memes like this. It is good tho. Just annoying
---
God this hurts my brain not being able to do your main objective is FUN as you endless get looped and have to run around keeping a bunch of survivors (who can get up by them selves by the way) down as stay in a game where you will lose and get like no BP for and eternity
---
Le ancient Japanese murder man has arrived

BHVR bought the rights to DBD and then split from Starbreeze.
---
Would be so great
---
Survivors are toxic more frequently than I am. I wouldn't do it every game, just whenever I felt like using the build for fun.
---
Initial reactions are important, but so many people are hopping on the ~~"Ghostface is new worst Killer"~~ "Oni is new Spirit" train without realizing that the Public **Test** Build is meant to publicly **test** things.
---
I'm waiting for PTB 2 to see how they iron out some of Oni's initial problems, cause right now he's really strong. But I'm not about to demand nerfs on a Killer who isn't even out yet.
---
I know that some of the event cosmetics have been causing problems for folks, and I know that they've put them on for the first time recently. Not sure if that has anything to do with your case.
---
The problem is asking for a montly reward lol. League of Leguends rewards with a skin but the "seasons" lasts way more than a month
---
Better than nothing yeah, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a better solution and clearly the devs agree with that. As for bp, a pretty significant portion of red rank players have all perks unlocked and what percentage of people REALLY care about prestige? Prestige for a lot of people is that thing you do when you have nothing else to spend your bp on anymore. So really, how enticing would a bp reward be to the people that routinely get to rank 1? For shards I think it‚Äôs that BHVR doesn‚Äôt want a ton of people to get all the unlicensed characters for free within days of release. If the amount of shards was large enough for people to care it would dent their profits fairly significantly on anything non-lisenced, and if it wasn‚Äôt a large amount of shards then people would often be like ‚Äúmeh, not worth it‚Äù
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt throw down the pallets, 4head‚Äù

You are not a legion main. We do not recognize you as such.

Perhaps it would work in a spirit camping build. They'll think I'm phasing.

Thanks for the input.

Just don't nerf him. DON'T TOUCH ONI and give him more time.

Unless it's changed, you'll see the hatch icon appear next to the gen icon.

You should also consider other games you may play, so keep that in mind.
---
Get a budget set up and do research, then build off from there. :)
---
I love this I love this fucking stupid ass explanation go tell everyone about your genius idea of DonT hOoK peOple anD leT tHEM bLeEd OuT and see if they agree with it like if it‚Äôs so fun to let people bleed out why not do it every game huh?
---
Hmmm ok. But I am getting this bad fps in the menu as well not just in game, in fact I first noticed it in the menu. Would the cosmetics still effect the menu somehow even though I don't have any of them on or anything? I was playing just fine yesterday, no lag at all of any kind.
---
Still toxic. A fun build once or twice, but still not nice.
---
not sure why someone downvoted your comment, you‚Äôre correct lol
---
Sadly no, I think BHVR tried to negotiate for it originally but they could only get the 2010 film version. Pretty disappointing, but who knows, maybe someday.
---
If you get a laptop you will be getting much less performance per dollar spent so make sure you consider that when making your decision. As for what spec you want to look for anything mid range will be enough. I have a 1070 and i5 7500 and the game runs well with my 144hz monitor. But then again i only play at 1080p and use medium quality settings

That's literally the purpose of the PTB and has nothing to do with others' enjoyment of the new content. If you're disturbed by others forming opinions about something that is literally begging for people's opinions, you're the one keeping others from having fun. It's ultimately up to the devs to make a decisions based on *everyone's* feedback, so put in your two cents and continue to enjoy the PTB.
---
Like I said, they deserve it.
---
The other day I bumped into a P3 Jane in a lobby and I (being a Jane main myself before best boy Steve was added) swapped to my Jane as well.
---
We both found each-other while injured and imagine my surprise when we didn't have to listen to Jane's loud-ass porn noises *at all.* Iron Will is literally mandatory to play Jane because she's so fucking loud lol.

Yeah, I‚Äôve had it activate with deadhard - its a known bug

I laughed at this way more than I should've
---
The hatch will spawn when there are more gens completed then survs alive. The hatch will open when you are the last surv alive. Most common hatch escape is when there are 3 gens done and 2 survs.

Bloodpoints &amp; shards are a good idea.

Exclusive cosmetics would be annoying. Free cosmetics others can buy would be alright.
---
No, they need to find a good balance. If the system only entices newer players to climb the ranks then suddenly purple ranks ends up filled with the veterans while red ranks is a mixture of all kinds of players of different skill levels. This would make it so that people that belong in purple ranks wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay there because they‚Äôd be extremely outkilled in almost every match. If they don‚Äôt balance it nicely then it‚Äôll break the entire system

That would split the player base. These long waiting times many people experience will just become worse. It's better to keep everyone into one mode.
---
iz spooky month
---
Yep pretty much...
---
Does Oni have layers?
---
Reread this post and now finally understand the true punchline.
---
Shit that's not very comforting lol
---
50% off
---
Legion was never good. in fact, the devs openly said they didnt design him to be good, just to have a fun playstyle. then just after release, someone found an exploit that made his crappy power way too strong, with no way for survivors to beat it if it was properly done, which was easy. So it was obvious that needed to be nerfed, but really that was the only problem. without that exploit, he'd go back to being a bad killer with a style some might like anyway.
---
but the devs didnt just nerf that. they nerfed a whole crapload of other things about Legion's power and add ons that had nothing to do with the exploit. so legion went from low tier to beneath sub-basement tier. 
---
Now they just announced they're nerfing him again, but also they announced a new perk that could make him very strong, but they'll likely nerf that or him in some way before it gets released anyway.
---
Otz using Furtive Chase on Myers be like "Am I a joke to you?"
---
He is an ogre
---
There are plenty of legitimate criticisms that are very difficult to frame properly because of how new the killer is. Many experienced players understand how difficult to counter the chase is on this killer, and strong or not, minimal counter does not a good game mechanic make. That's where things get messy is discussing balance apart from fairness.
---
Seriously what is with these garbage ass posts. This is specifically why we go play the PTB. It's nice I'd you use it to get some free content, but it's specifically a tool to help keep broken and over powered shit out of the game.
---
And they don't even use it properly half the time.
---
Also what does people having fun with a new killer have to do with anything if it turns out it's not fun to play AGAINST them? Imagine thinking like this....
---
That's not a good outlook to have. We're all just tryna enjoy the same game, us killers and those survivor mains.
---
Rift fragments is an interesting idea for sure, that might work
---
If a 2k counts as a win maybe the ranking system should reflect that.
---
Yeah enjoy bulling low ranks no wonder you think people can‚Äôt get gens done because you‚Äôve deranked to the low where survivors don‚Äôt do gens this build used by red ranks is unbeatable
---
hurr durr killer mains toxic give me upvote

Is there a picture of him? Cause I assumed he had a model, but there is no way it's not altered and downgraded a bunch, lol.

I'm pretty sure it's kill survivor with (killer name)

It makes you bleed more and get exhausted IF you‚Äôre injured. That isn‚Äôt that valuable compared to current meta perks.

*removes Legion*

So the balanced landing changes, that's not a nerf at all?

Why does she have meg sounds

Then he‚Äôd be trash
---
I don't even use NOED, butI just got the sacrifice 1000 survivors achievement and I have never once had a hex totem spawn in a bugged location. I have, however, had 2-3 survivors escape via key with 1-2 gens left multiple times. It feels terrible to get a free de-pip because someone brought an item and got lucky. At least survivors can die and still pip.
---
I don't know how they would implement dbd as fighters since no one in dbd can jump, but I would love trapper, huntress or nurse assist trophys

That's really not an argument at all. Just because he doesn't have it all the time it doesn't mean its not OP

Lol ‚ÄúI liked camping builds‚Äù. I get that everyone is supposed to have their fun but Jesus Christ dude
---
Do you 4k or let the last survivor go? Giving hatch as often as possible probably helps a bit, though I know it can still be tough not to pip if you really go off.
---
TOOLBOXES BASICALLY FULFILL THE SAME EFFECT THOUGH! INSTEAD OF INSTANT PROGRESS FOR BRINGING BACK GAS, YOU FIX THE GEN FASTER; THE SAME PROGRESS IS GAINED IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME, BUT THE TOOLBOX DOESNT REQUIRE YOU TO GO LOOKING FOR IT

---
General Blendobi
---
Same. I just feel if it was changed, maybe becoming a token perk where you have to hook all survivors once with some extra benefits, it would be more generally useful and not just a safety net that forces survivors to do bones or risk it.
---
You slow down every single time you absorb the blood and lose the power completely when you pick someone up.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about some of the others, but isn‚Äôt you 1. On killer perks just ‚ÄúSpies from the Shadows‚Äù
---
Because then it‚Äôll restart the meme of them just doing bandaid fixes on everything. People hate interim changes the majority of the time so he devs want to get it right the first time
---
That's a completely separate thing though. Only matters if you're trying to get adept demo achievement.
---
I haven't actually tried leaving their line of sight, I usually just stand in the loop waiting for them lol I can see how that's not such a smart idea
---
And yeah, I've played some killer but never actually analyzed what survivors do, I'll give that a shot aswell
---
Hard to turn corners, can't hit through windows and a survivor must bleed for awhile then you get it for a minute. Did I mention that Billy has it whenever he wants, and he can hit through windows?

ruins BP economy, pls nerf it and pig    /s

You should do your own research but if you want an example of Oni‚Äôs counterplays

Can confirm every word of your comment as a plague maon on pc
---
Noed isn‚Äôt a problem really, but I‚Äôd say relying on it makes you a worse killer.
---
That‚Äôs only for when it‚Äôs opened
---
Thank you may I please have another?
---
Yeah but Haunted ground doesn‚Äôt require you to fail at your job(pressuring gens). Personally, i would like NOED to be more useful to skilled killers. Maybe they could make it a token perk instead with extra benefits like i suggested in other threads.
---
Okay if you're just going to make shit up, I'm done here. I'll address your lies here, but won't do it in any more comments.
---
&gt;you again he no BP
---
Do you think people just wouldn't verify the shit you say? You can just google this. Stop being an idiot. There's a score value for when the survivor reads out, see [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints).
---
&gt; you De Pip
---
You meant to say "I depip". This is a personal problem.
---
&gt;impossible to do you objective as killer like what?
---
It is not impossible. Get over yourself. 
---
You got outplayed by survivors who were going to win regardless, that happened to have no mither equipped. If this was even half as strong as you suggest, this would be the survivor meta.
---
Just like a killer, hmmm.
---
I AM STOKED ABOUT THEM CHEEEEEKS! CLAP CLAP CLAP LIKE THUNDER!

New best girl :)

cheers love, the cavalry‚Äôs queer

But how dare you leave the game early! You still have one more gen to go and you never know, I might actually get a kill this game /s

Alternatively OP can do 'better' than this but rushed this out for the lols and didn't put as much effort into it.
---
Yeah, if this would happen, definitely Chanel. Also thank you, I put quite some work into it!
---
the moaning while hooked makes me a little uncomfortable
---
I WANT SURVIVORS TO HAVE TO GO LOOK FOR IT THOUGH, THE WHOLE POINT IS TO GIVE KILLERS MORE WAYS TO INTERACT AND DELAY THE SURVIVORS WHILE STILL LETTING SURVIVORS BE ABLE TO MAKE GOOD PLAYS OF THEIR OWN.
---
In wouldnt be surprised if next killer is based on bloodlust.
---
I love that the sewater text keeps changing.
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Why does wiggling off a killer heal survivors?
---
Why do the survivors get a speed boost when getting hit?
---
Why do these big strong killers get stunned by a pallet?
---
Why cant killers just put the pallet back up instead of breaking it?
---
How do survivors recover so easily from being slashed 2 times and getting a hook trough your shoulder?
---
How does swinging your arms and legs around somehow make the killer completly drop you?
---
Why are the speed walking killers faster than the running survivors?
---
Why cant the killer just grab survivors when they reach them instead lf hitting them and letting them run away?
---
Love the art style!
---
That's true
---
Glad I bought him with in-game currency. That's really a kick in the groin to people who spent money on him.

---
Is this true's first game? He made so many mistakes
---
why did you lost -88 karma? LOL
---
For real tho, Bills my favorite fictional character period.
---
Who tf uses perks and just says "I don't want to use this". Makes no sense. Theres this stigma that certain perks are only used if you are a bad at the game. 
---
Noed can be destroyed before it even activates. The activation of noed is 100% based on how survivors handle the trial. So, by your logic, if noed activates, the survivors are bad? I don't think so. The perk is hardly worth it and the amount of hate it gets honestly blows my mind. Again, mostly because it is 100% on the survivors it even activates.
---
The reasons they should are obvious, there‚Äôs no point to me explaining those. Rather I used my comment to point out why it isn‚Äôt a perfect solution so that people would approach it with a better understanding. I don‚Äôt know their art team so I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre capable of, but I doubt they can manage to add another cosmetic set every month on top of the ones they already make. Charms could be interesting, we‚Äôll have to see what they decide to do with those. Bloodpoints would be good for newer players for sure, but wouldn‚Äôt really help people that are past the grind so it would lead to a weird system where newer players are trying to push to rank 1 while the good players stay at rank 8. Suddenly people that belong at rank 6 can‚Äôt get there because they‚Äôre being stomped from ranks 10-7. It would honestly just make it more frustrating for the people that do want rank 1

Good one.
---
Oni is not completely different from Billy dude, Oni is literally Billy with extra steps and more maneuverability to make up for it. Billy even has a more consistent flick to him and his chainsaw has some auto aim.

If a Billy is right behind you in the open you have about as much chance of dodging them as you do an Oni.

NOED doesn't necessarily require you to fail. Endgame builds are a thing (see bloodwarden, remember me). Besides, some games are gonna go to endgame, even if the killer is decent. You gotta chase people sometime.
---
How did you think of this!?
---
Tell that to all bulk downvotes I get for defending Killer elements like NOED and use of good addons.

sounds good. i assume you're familiar with the scratches that survivors leave then, ja? running around is a surefire way to get caught. when i play killer, scratches are the easiest way to find a survivor

Which is why he can't. And no he can't turn sharp enough to catch someone

He is chasing people.
---
How is it fun standing by a hook for 2-3 minutes waiting for a survivor to die?
---
Doesn't matter if they're memeing, an entirely unbalanced game isn't enjoyable. Jason being in DbD would also likely be unbalanced and unfun due to the chatacter's nature.
---
I dont know man, people have been DCing on me all day, not the kick thing either since everyone left after I got a ballsy stab on a jake as ghostface and i just finished a match cause the 3 survivors left the game early despite having only 1 gen.
---
Fair. I just feel like., if you don‚Äôt play well in the first place you don‚Äôt really deserve to get a instadown perk.
---
Smash is for good boys and girls so sadly OUR dream will most likely never come to be.
---
Yeah i dont get why people lost their shit with noed. If noed rewards you for failing to protect gens then ds rewards you for getting hooked.
---
I just want to say that it's not killer hating post lol. Calm your tits. Go see yourself how many posts about toxic survivor you can find.
---
First time in ages that no one is complaining about Head Hard
---
Only works if the killer also gets to ban survivor perks tbh
---
Nope. I‚Äôd attribute it to the maybe being dark as fuck and the fact that its hard to see what you‚Äôre doing with Oni unless you bring Shadowborn.
---
I just call her hagatha or harpy claw bitch
---
Yea you‚Äôre just bad m8.

---
I think that iridescent bag would be great. no walking to find traps. But Ive gotten some hooks from the stone before. It allows you to actually pick up a trap and get someone with it. I generally put traps on vaults but random places work well also.
---
People never used to play trapper at all. Be glad you get to see him finally.
---
This is the definition of a shitpost.
---
I like the concept of the perk, they just might have to add a ‚Äúdoes not stack with nemesis‚Äù line to some other things in game. And they need to do something about deep wounds as every new thing breaks it again.
---
My point is, if you‚Äôre relying on your noed and that shit spent active; you‚Äôre fucked. Noed usually rewards killers who didn‚Äôt put any gen pressure with a kill or two. It teaches you that oh, end game I‚Äôll still get a kill, until you get to higher ranks and they destroy all you totems or find it immediately, then the perk you were depending on disappears. So yes I think using noed makes you a worse killer in the long run.
---
I mean you listed all the mechanics survivors have, so
---
she really has one of the worst faces to work with in SFM, can‚Äôt blame you ü§ß

a. Not everyone has ghostface

I play both sides so calm your tits. What i see is survivors complaining about killers that are too strong for them as they use the same meta perks game after game
---
Lol yea I‚Äôm kinda both sides but I just sat down and started thinking of all the whys in this game.
---
The point is that both of those take time. Time in which the blood orbs can start to pool up.

That's why you loop around or be in a place with lots of corners like the docs map

Usually Wraith, Trapper, and Leatherface players tend to use NOED. I use it on them too because they're pretty weak and need that boost in endgame. Wraith's just wimpy, Trapper spends SO MUCH TIME setting up he's more of a late-game killer, and Leatherface's chainsaw is so hard to get people with you might as well not have a power.
---
I only give hatch or let people go if they either got screwed by DCs or shitty teammates that gave them away or something like that or if I just reeeeally like the survivor for some reason. Normally I do kinda go off ig but I can't help it . To be honest I tried depipping before but I can't sit still and just let it happen I just start wanting to play normally and it just cementse in rank 1-2 territory
---
You have a point. Like your response I was in a weird mood while waiting for a match and I started thinking of all the whys does this happen in the game.
---
All of you. The majority of you? Really? Then how come people routinely build up a million bloodpoints and then be like ‚Äúwell, guess I‚Äôll spend some‚Äù and try to find what they should spend it on just so they can go back to matches? Once you‚Äôre past the grind in this game the bloodpoints you get from playing the game greatly outnumbers the amount you need to spend and you get a surplus. Adding more surplus wouldn‚Äôt help

Ok so something I learned. players who go against spirit tend to walk away until she finishes her phase. Ive only gotten one down and that was purely because the vault i was stuck at was unsafe af. As for everyone else, Run away if   
---
a) you stunned them with a pallet. Don't milk it. You can return if you want to it and stick it between two loops, but if theyre not close together don't. 
---
b) you have quick and quiet. I suggest watching the other side of the loop, not the pallet side. If thats the case and you end up seeing them, quickly go over the pallet and walk to a locker and Head On. Head On is really useful when paired with DS
---
agreed, but it is still dumb because you still get points for it, the killer still makes the grunt that indicates they got clobbered, only they just hold on to the survivor.
---
This is also true. But lets be honest. Spirit was waaaaay to overpowered and unfair. Perks.. Well.. The only perks I see that people are complaining about is noed and ds
---
&gt;Safety pip with zero hooks?
---
Yes. Safety pip with zero hooks.
---
Very cool, thanks for sharing
---
Some people are WAY TOO SERIOUS ABOUT GAMES
---
It does take a while. I‚Äôm devotion 5 and still only recently unlocked all teachables. Admittedly I‚Äôve levelled up a bunch of characters to probably what would be the 250 mark too though
---
Yea I can see that now
---
"Alright, hear me out. I think that giving legion a buff is probably the best thing we could do as of now." Famous last words of BHVR employee before getting locked in the basement.
---
Not a bad idea
---
Relax I was just making a guess. Plus I don‚Äôt care if people disagree with me. They are making good points that I never thought of before so I agree with them because I‚Äôm willing to change my opinion if the facts are their.
---
Even if infinite‚Äôs were removed completely, BL should still be nerfed. It is by far the strongest exhaustion perk there is.
---
Yes it does lol.  Insidious Camping has always been toxic.
---
Then why isn't this the survivor meta?
---
How come 99% of games at rank 1, I don't experience this.
---
You're a fucking bad killer dude. You want to blame the game and survivors for something that is due to a lack of talent.
---
Be better, stop bitching, stop lying, work on your punctuation.
---
**loads up pepper spray**..... yes.
---
The "Killers didn't put any gen pressure" is a flawed argument. The game goes so fast already that if I get hit by noed, it was likely with 6-7 minutes. If survivors took some time to actually cleanse totems then noed would not be a problem.
---
"We need a totem counter" not exactly, but there should be some sort of way to communicate in game, aside from voice chat. 
---
Noed doesn't make anyone bad, it is just there to punish the survivors who attempt to make a quick escape. I know there is little to nothing I can say that will change your mind, nor am I trying tbh. Just wanted to help crush this ridiculous stigma.
---
But you live, you live to fight another day.
---
That‚Äôs it‚Äôs not a high priority, it‚Äôs on the ‚Äúwhen we fix the big issues then we fix...‚Äù list
---
Oh? You are stalking me? Instead of stalking the others, you stalk me?
---
There called windows and jungle gyms
---
Trapper needs something, but it's not more traps.
---
I've stopped entire games from progressing with just 7, I dont feel like we need more.
---
I do hate walking across the entire map for traps though, would be nice if we had another way to get them.
---
Jotaro! Have you not played a video game before!?
---
5 sec
---
I JUST CAME BACK AFTER AN 8 MONTH BREAK AND DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THIS ARCHIVE STUFF IS IS THIS SERIOUSLY A GODDAMN TIERED LEVELLING SYSTEM I GUESS THE NEW LORE DOCUMENTS ARE PRETTY OKAY THO!!!
---
20% increase to walking speed, not running speed
---
Yeah, I think a lot of people heard it a bit different.
---
yui has meg's voice actor i think
---
Why would Doctor need NOED? You don't have to worry about endgame if you 3-gen and ensure you never reach endgame in the first place.
---
Have you not seen the people complaining about the balanced landing change?
---
Well the game is full of stuff like that. Enduring and Spirit fury reward getting stunned, which would normally be bad play. Insidious actively encourages bad play. 
---
Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike reward bad unhooks. Adrenaline is a free instaheal, regardless if you played well or not. 
---
I don't think any of this is an issue though,  because it isn't actually rewarding unskilled play, it's enabling an alternative playstyle.
---
Tons of mobile games do it. F2P titles on pc and console. Hell, theres a whole swath of cosmetics leaked from the current ptb. Not like it would be impossible.
---
Its a circle that can go forever. It all comes down to how the survivors play and how the killer reacts. Too many variables to say that noed is the problem. 
---
There are even incentives to doing totems and perks that are decent enough to use every game. Besides, it's a fckn 4v1. Not breaking 5 totems is on you and your team, especially since you don't need to escape to rank.
---
ingame its feng min, not min feng so thats probably why
---
dude, in Ash vs the Evil Dead, Season 2, Bruce's head went up a corpse's asshole.  and that's not the worst that has happened in that show.  getting skinned is nothing XD  also...wish that show didn't get cancelled..
---
Ahhh. Yeah I saw it. Forgot about it ^^
---
lmao there is no way you can lose as a swf lmao, like literally just hold m1 and run in a circle if you hear a heartbeat and you win  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Apparently Shaman Myers is a thing.
---
Yeah he was taking what they said as satire... funny that people didn't expect the spirit's ancestor to not be good as her XD
---
Depending on one perk to maybe get you a kill, makes your thought process on killer pretty skewed. Depending on that perk to get you a kill makes your though process ‚Äúbad.‚Äù And most people I see running NOED are kinda shit, you may disagree with that because it‚Äôs a personal experience thing.
---
I play more killer than survivor and don't care if i get caught quicker when playing survivor.
---
I don't like the nerf because it takes away from the little bit of freedom i had when choosing how to play. With the stagger reduce you could run longer routes and it was simply more interesting.
---
Even as killer i prefer running half of the game map with clever drops and jukes on the staircases in between, instead of running circles around jungle gyms and god windows.
---
Nerfing things is not bad, but taking away something fun and only leaving monotonous alternatives that could be played by bots the same way is just sad.
---
And don't get me started on the tractor thing. Most ridicolous argument i've ever heard.
---
low effort? hell nah lol this is great
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES PLAGUE MAKE MY PEE PEE BIG WHEN I KNOW SHE‚ÄôLL JYST GIVE ME HERPEGONASYPHILLUS?!
---
Yeah, I have been checking it and both internet and ps4 service says everything's working fine but maybe it's just a bug right or weird server glitch or something.
---
I think starting with 3 traps would be good, but instead of the sacks allowing you to start with more/transport more have them increase the total number of traps you can place on the map.
---
How is it hard to get them back up if he slugs then runs away to find someone else also having unbreakable or tenacity will do wonders. I wish people who have only seen vids calling for nerfs would wait till they play against him. Personally I don't find him that bad He is A tier why does he need to be nerfed to B or worse. You hear him go into demon form hide in a locker don't get caught period he basically a killer with no ability Id rather deal with that then a billy who can sprint half way across the map and chainsaw u 20 second's into the game. The counter play is their for Oni problem is he hasn't even bin out long people still have to figure shit out. Stealth builds,lockers unbreakable tenacity all work really well against him and I am sure people will continue to figure shit out.
---
How is balanced landing "strong" like what about it i Dont use it really
---
Fair. I just feel it doesn‚Äôt have a place in most builds(which is a different story for stuff like DS) and could be more used and maybe mix the meta up a bit if it was tweaked.
---
Aaah good old times when saboteur ruled the land.
---
Good old times where noed was bland.
---
Idk where this is going but I kinda wish there was a way to play version 1.0 of dbd by devs like wow classic
---
That's just the shack nerf.
---
My only issue with the killer is his dash, his control in it is crazy. Too many times have I been around a wall that billy wouldn't have a chance to hit me at, only to be one shot by a flick or just by his ability to tightly turn corners. Everything else at most needs some light number tweaks.
---
Pls daddy yes
---
Really, it‚Äôs a great idea. I think people used to talk about this for a while, and I don‚Äôt get it why devs haven‚Äôt added it yet. The rank system now works in such a way, that it‚Äôs better not to rank up. I am usually around red ranks on both killer and survivor, and it is physically painful. I wait for a much longer time to get a match, survivors are often playing swf, killers are sweaty and toxic. And all I get for my effort is a red digit in a circle in the corner of my home screen. I really hope that devs will listen to the community and add at least some kind of reward for ranking up.
---
Switch version is horrible. Sadly switch is all I have to play on and I hate it. With the bugs and dropped frames/ visual bugs, it really feels unplayable sometimes. I still live the game and will play it but they really need to do something
---
White Claudette looked good
---
Love how Nurse is too busy being toxic before her nerf(unless it already came out) to show up.
---
Because of the shitty spaghetti coding we get from BhVR Interactive where on console are FPS are donkey shit compared to other developers who‚Äôs games run and look 100% better! DBD on console plays like it was built for the PS2...
---
DS and head on is a classic combo. It's TRUE locker tech
---
You act like once the gens are powered, the game is over.
---
Gotta get that self care challenge one way or another
---
I just think it was a bit unfair to say you haven‚Äôt played that much like that invalidates their opinion on the game changing.
---
But I‚Äôll also admit I probably wasn‚Äôt in the right mental state to be replying to people on reddit since I don‚Äôt remember anything about what I said it was probably all reactionary.
---
with Balanced Landing getting nerfed and MoM hopefully becoming easier to use with the changes to protection hits, I'm becoming a MoM gamer next patch. I've been using it recently and haven't really ran into "protection hits not counting" and getting MoM to proc after I've just saved a poor survivor off the hook from a face camper and we both bolt to the exit gate with my MoM and the BT I've given to the hooked survivor
---
fucking priceless.
---
What is a head on?
---
If you want to edit better, use a editing program to remove the background and add the three other sonics in with transparent ones, then edit the faces over after removing the backgrounds.
---
I like your mori idea if they have no plans on removing moris. I do feel like moris make the game unbalanced and should be removed completely though. They can turn any game into an easy 4K by tunneling one guy off the first hook, you can‚Äôt even counter with DS. I see suggestions about buyable moris to further customize the killer but once they do that they can never remove them from the game.
---
5 seconds.
---
Who are these cute survivors?
---
The killer bans 1/2 perks. For example a match where the killer can't pick the nurse but the survivor can use neither dead hard nor self care. They both get fucked now
---
There are several maps with already strong loops that become infinite, or near infinite loops with the stagger reduction.
---
Horrifying in a horror game?? :O
---
&gt;Get rid of tunneling
---
Yeah, how dare the killer chase someone again.
---
Oh I hadn't heard about that, what are they?
---
Yeah all the models are a lil ugly I think the prettiest face model is definitely Claudette 
---
But behavior REALLY needs better talent or at least work on their modeling
---
you don't need to explain personal taste
---
Wat u talkin about snake is already in smash
---
You're right about it not having a place in most builds, I personally never use it. I don't think it needs a tweak though, because most of the time it's actually a bad perk. If you let all 4 get to endgame with NOED, most of the time you just hook one guy and the other three leave because it isn't worth it. It's a high-risk, low-reward perk.
---
It sucks for the one guy, but survivors can still pip if they die, and if you made it to endgame and weren't fucking around the whole time you'll probably get black pip at the worst.
---
&gt;nor self care
---
Ah, so your rank 15
---
 Yeah but those have the downsides of being pink and purple addons, meaning you can't run them every game unlike perks.
---
why are you being downvoted for this
---
The oni skin with the wolf on his shoulder and the one with all that black armor are gonna be instant buys for me
---
Doesn't matter. Just stop moving for a second, and it stops. Since he's making sure to run in circles, he clearly knows about the glitch and how to keep it going.
---
(*inhales*) BOI
---
You‚Äôre right idk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted
---
I would love to get one.
---
Fair enough. It just really sucks leveling it because i was forced to and not being able to use it.
---
Is it just me. It might just be. But s huge ass gun might be an advantage

**The Terminator Chapter Concept v3**
---
#New Location: Skynet Research Facility
---
##The Terminator
---
*Music: [Chase](https://youtu.be/AOS1pMQVrCQ)*
---
The Terminator starts trials with a Handgun equipped with a laser sight. He can carry up to **14 rounds** at a time (7 per clip), and can find small amounts of ammo scattered throughout the map. **Holding down the Power button** draws the Handgun, allowing The Terminator to aim using the laser sight, and fire by **tapping the Attack button**. The Terminator **cannot move** while using the Handgun. Additionally, the Handgun's fire-rate is limited to one shot every **.20 seconds**, and has a **maximum range of 16 meters**. While not using the Handgun, the attack button activates a basic punch.
---
###Passive: I'll be Back
---
The Terminator earns a **token** each time a Survivor is rescued from a hook. After earning three tokens, he unlocks the **Cyborg Assault** ability. **Holding down the Power button** pulls out an M16 (auto-rifle) and a SPAS-12 (shotgun). These weapons are limited to a total of **30 rounds** and **8 shells**, respectively. The M16 becomes less accurate during sustained fire, and has a maximum range of **20 meters**. The SPAS-12 can be fired every **.30 seconds**, and has a maximum range of **12 meters**. Additionally, The Terminator's vision is tinted red, and he can see the auras of Survivors while their scratch marks and/or blood trails are visible. After **15 seconds**, **Cyborg Assault** ends, and the tokens **reset**. Unlike using the Handgun, The Terminator can **move** while **Cyborg Assault** is active.
---
###Perks
---
**Nice Night for a Walk**
---
- Who doesn't enjoy a peaceful stroll on a cool night? Your Terror Radius is increased by **2 meters** every **6/5/4 seconds** while chasing a Survivor, stacking to a maximum of **12 meters**. After your Terror Radius reaches its maximum, you can break through a pallet by simply walking into it. This effect resets after walking through a pallet, or when the chase ends.
---
**Targeted for Termination**
---
- The Entity has identified a key target. You have become obsessed with one Survivor. Each time you land a hit on your obsession, your movement speed is increased by **1/2/3%**, stackable up to **6%**. If your obsession dies, you become obsessed with a new Survivor.
---
**Substance Scanner**
---
- Your extensive knowledge of human behavior allows you to analyze the trails of your prey with extreme precision. Scratch marks are color-coded, allowing you to differentiate between Survivor trails.
---
##Sarah Connor
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/al59FDEV5E0)*
---
**Hard Target**
---
- You've spent countless years eluding danger, and have become proficient at covering your tracks. When not running, leave no scratch marks.
---
**Desperate Struggle**
---
- After a long and taxing journey, you refuse to accept defeat. While being carried by the Killer, you can partially control their movement, making it harder for them to navigate (tier upgrades increase the amount of movememt control).
---
**It's Not Over Yet**
---
- Your will is unbreakable. If you are one of only two remaining **Survivors**, trigger a **Hard/Normal/Easy** skill check while in the **Struggle** phase of being sacrificed, giving you one last chance to escape.
---
##Kyle Reese
---
**Come with Me if You Want to Live**
---
- You invoke courage and hope in those around you. You move **2%** faster than normal, and receive an additional **1%** speed bonus for each Survivor within **16/18/20 meters**. This effect also applies to Survivors within the active radius. Survivors can only be affected by one instance of **Come with Me if You Want to Live** at a time.
---
**Sawed-off Shotgun**
---
- Always come prepared. Start the trial with a Sawed-off Shotgun loaded with **4/5/6 shells**. Aim the weapon by **holding down the Actions button**, and fire it by **tapping the (new) Defense button** (Square, on PS4). You are unable to move while the Sawed-off Shotgun is drawn. It can be fired every **.70 seconds** (after each pump), and has a maximum range of **12 meters**. Landing a shot on a Killer closer than **4 meters** knocks them off their feet for **3 seconds** (The Nurse just gets a prolonged stun), landing a shot on a Killer between **4 and 8 meters** stuns them for **1 second**, and landing a shot on a Killer between **8 and 12 meters** stuns them for **.50 seconds**. Shooting a Killer carrying a Survivor does not free the Survivor. Once the Sawed-off Shotgun is empty, it is discarded. *The mechanics are identical to Resident Evil 4.*
---
**Pipe Bomb**
---
- You've spent months studying fortification and defense strategies. Plant a proximity-based explosive charge, capable of stunning the Killer for **5 seconds**. Upon detonation, the Killer's aura is revealed to all Survivors for **3 seconds**. After using the Pipe Bomb, it becomes unavailable for **180/150/120 seconds**. If you've placed a Pipe Bomb, and it hasn't been triggered, you can pick it back up. Only one Pipe Bomb can be active at a time.
---
YES! Thank you! I thought I was the only one! It‚Äôs awful. Seeing frame rates drop like flies, The amount of lag in the servers. I really enjoy this game but damn, it‚Äôs tough to love it on switch
---
"Let's three gen ourselves because we don't pay attention and the map is broken as shit, but as soon as one person dies or dcs we all get out for free, weeee"

BHVR should just take after fighting games and match players who frequently rage quit together lol
---
Testing things to take note of bugs before it goes live
---
Didn‚Äôt you see the funny jojoe epic maymay??
---
Uhh no when did I say that? I'm saying that even if they kill themselves you still get rewarded. Fuck DCing
---
If was just to say. You can ban ds, borrowed,adrenaline and so on instead
---
I don‚Äôt really care about the meme comments, but it‚Äôs annoying when you try to have an informative argument, and you‚Äôre fed nothing but insults and downvotes.
---
he's not there *creepy sound*
---
this is reddit, informative arguments, while good, are a rarity.
---
And then we have the facecamp meta, ban borrowed and ds
---
*Hears phase from behind*
---
O_o
---
It needed to get changed it enabled way too many god loops
---
Wait for the new killer
---
I'm glad you labeled it as suggestions he doesn't need all of these things but some of these things would make me a happier trapper
---
So are the DC penalty‚Äôs going to take affect for consoles players to? 
---
How are they going to know if the game booted me or I pulled the plug or hit the button to exit the match? 
---
Are they turning on dedicated servers for consoles players?
---
The OG squad! Love the art! Thanks for sharing
---
Thats not even what Syndrome says there....
---
Ah yeah, good catch.
---
It‚Äôs pretty close to over at that point, we can go with the old reddit strategy of ‚Äúwell the gems were done and I caught someone finally so your damn right I‚Äôm gonna camp them‚Äù
---
Dedicated servers have been live on PC for quite a while now.
---
I like the way you worded that. Freedom on how we play.
---
It's a glitch. It's happened to me on this map before, too. It stopped when I jumped through the hole on the second floor.
---
So 1 perk is enough
---
As a claudette main a completely agree.

---
Hey, I can have an opinion too without crying lol
---
You're overthinking this a bit, there's obviously times when a killer might over-chase a survivor and waste time, but it's almost always in your best interest as a killer to target a player closer to removal from the match.
---
I got ya! I do that way too much hahaha
---
Don‚Äôt act surprised on what‚Äôs wrong with tunneling
---
You had me at porn noises
---
Nobody even said anything about camping.
---
Anyway, you also realize you don't need to escape to rank up right?
---
They need to change how ranked seasons work in order to effectively do it IMO.  Only way it would work right now is if they rewarded some bloodpoints and then possibly gave some tokens towards a cosmetic set (akin to the serum used for the Halloween cosmetics).  
---
But what would be better is if they expanded seasons to last 3 months to reflect each season of the year, and also possibly run it with each Archive Rift so each new Rift also brings a new season with it.   Then the ranked reward could be something like an exclusive variant of a skin that you can obtain from the Rift, or tokens (akin to the serums from the Halloween events) that can go to a new type of skin for any Survivor/Killer.  Basically something along the lines of a new variant of the Prestige cosmetics.
---
Here's all the cutscenes from the archives!
---
Lmao. You're shit at the game my friend.
---
If being successful at it is a priority to you, you should find another hobby.
---
You check everywhere near. No one is here. When you start to grap the guy. It happen. I got bully by nei with op flashlight. It take me so much time to catch here for finally lost her because of a flashlight save. And when you break a pallet, you can't look away, you are obligatory blind.
---
or here's an idea, change up your exhaustion perks, if all survivors used lithe and sprint burst more than dead hard and balanced landing it wouldn't have been an issue the problem was it was the only exhaustion perk that gave benefits while you were exhausted, if legion can have its frenzy nerfed just so it stays consistent then idk why this change is a bad thing.
---
r/TIHI this comment section
---
Tunneling is just gen-rushing for killers, don't take it personally, killing survivors is literally their only objective.
---
Only thing I can think of is Haddonfield. Again, change that. Not the perk itself.
---
Ya but he also has to actually find and hit healthy survivors unlike billy who can just chainsaw right from the start. You can still dodge the lunge attack.
---
Exactly they gave demi the ability to break pallets with his ability, ghostface was just a mess in the ptb but was way stronger after he got released, etc..
---
In a different way I mean
---
Tunneling is just doing the objective, you need to stop making your opponent responsible for your fun, or poor decisions from your teammates.
---
I agree that dead hard absolutely sucks right now and I‚Äôm just as pissed as you because that was my exhaustion perk. Unfortunately I ended up switching to BL because I could only use DH for distance and it sucked. I hope they fix dedicated servers and latency soon because honestly, it‚Äôs ruining the game for me because it‚Äôs more than just getting through dead hard. It‚Äôs getting hit through pallets, windows, around corners, and even the air.
---
for that specific challenge, you only have to *complete* the generator. you don't have to complete the equivalent of 3 full generators in a single match. my wife and i both got this in the same day.  you got this!  this challenge could use some clarification though
---
Wait, its on mobile?? I dont have it on my app store. (I use Android)
---
You dumb bastard, you‚Äôve blown our cover!
---
Sad, when i play survivor, i only get immersed teammates that walk crouched and are scare to do gens, and when i play killer i aways get an optimal swf team that rush gens amd knows how to loop for ages
---
There comes a point in a chase where they‚Äôre gaining distance and you have to choose between dropping the pallet and stunning them, or dying. This perk makes that option: wasting a pallet and dying, or dying.
---
If I am getting chased off the hook then I expect my teammates to continue with gens after or if I get caught. If you're on the hook, you need to plan your escape. Use dead hard and/or ds to help with unhook pressure. 
---
Just play smarter. I realize most of this will in fact go over your head. I get that impression from your post. Hope my advice helps.
---
If a survivor is teabagging me and is toxic, I'm going to camp him. It's fucked up that your defending toxic survivors while saying it's bad for killers to be toxic. I don't just do it to anyone you know.
---
Talk about hypocritical.
---
No killer get to ban a survivor and their teachables for example if I banned David then surivors can run any David perks
---
"For a little over a month, dedicated servers have been live on the PC version of the game. Over the course of this test, we have often been asked why the servers were left on without any updates."
---
they've been testing them. that definitely doesn't mean they're bug free, and really doesn't mean that "they'll" stay when they finish *testing*
---
The victim complex is real. 
---
What rank do you play at? At higher ranks tunneling will get you DS‚Äôd and face camping will get you genrushed against any competent survivor team.
---
*Adjusting BL is the starting point of fixing infinites.* The perk made structures which already had strong looping potential even worse; if you had to manage resources on a dev team,
---
would you dedicate those resources to reworking every map or structure that becomes infinitely stronger with BL, or would you take a look at the perk that is causing them to be so strong? It‚Äôll still allow you to get more use out of loops that other exhaustion perks would not be able to, just not remotely as much or after you‚Äôve already used the perk. Exhaustion perks are the only perks in the game that have a cooldown for a reason.
---
The game does not somehow cater to killers exclusively, not by a pretty significant margin. Nurse just got nerfed and spirit is in the process of being nerfed while not many low tier killers have been reworked/buffed properly (sans Freddy), styptic agents are stronger than they were pre-rework, and competent SWF teams are still the scariest thing to go up against. In the last DLC survivors got 6 new perks, many of which are very good. In comparison there were three new killer perks, and I have yet to see mind breaker or cruel limits get even a fraction of the use rate that inner strength, fixated, or even babysitter does. 
---
If that isn‚Äôt enough for you, take a look at the current new set of perks. Survivors can now reset a dropped pallet every 2 minutes. Imagine a SWF running 4 of these; playing around pallets or manipulating them into leaving the loop requires much more thought and effort but becomes an infinitely worse option than breaking it and letting them run to the next pallet, because there‚Äôs a good chance the pallet (which is meant to be a valuable and limited resource) will be reset x4. Even two people running this would be annoying. In contrast, killers get...Windows of Opportunity? A perk to make legion sort of viable exclusively in 1 v 1 as long as the survivor stuns him? A perk that might work well on plague? And oni is probably getting nerfed before release.
---
Toxic survivors can't tell me how to play.
---
It's satisfying to get revenge.
---
*Obviously* that's not a good play, but I feel like people purposely move the goal posts on what you consider 'tunneling' whenever it's convenient. Literally nobody believes that letting 3 players rush gens while you target one player repeatedly is a good play.....the point is that it's generally in a killer's best interest to lower the amount of opponents as quickly as possible.
---
They didn‚Äôt. It was probably just to scare - they have no way to prove you knew it was a bug and purposely ran it.
---
A perk, stuns the killer when you jump out of a locker next to them.
---
I personally like the fact that they nerfed it but feel that they did it too hard.
---
Having 100% stagger reduction when not exhausted and 25%-50% when not echausted would have been nice.
---
Amen! Too many people complaining already and Oni is not out yet.
---
I had to redo everything when I switched over and it sucked. I hope they don‚Äôt go through with giving everyone the exclusive cosmetics in hope that if cross play allows merging I‚Äôll get my huntress and David jacket from the event a few yrs ago.
---
Ffs. 
---
Dear devs, just nerf him at realease. Save us all some time.
---
If you think this is bad wait until level 4... if I recall correctly its the same challenge but its now 4 gens instead of 3.
---
You only have to be on the gen when it finishes as well.
---
Its pretty hard without friends.
---
I would rather the challenges be grindy and achievable through some skill but mostly just gameplay. Some of the challenges are too situational and rely on luck.
---
Here they are making great lore and the vast majority of the community will only get to experience it when someone uploads it because of some of these challenges.
---
I hope after this tome they will see how very few complete some of these and adjust accordingly.
---
While it would be cool chapter, I don't know what power he would have. The only thing I can think of is a tempoary aura reveal, which would either be OP or useless depending on balancing.
---
Lore wise, the Enity wouldn't take notice of it as it feeds of the hope and dispair of Killers and Survivors alike. The T-800 is a machine, and even if it were to commit mass genocide, it would be useless to the Entity as there's nothing to feed on.
---
I agree. So called genrushing does NOT happen every game, and if it does you‚Äôre just playing like shit. Learn when to give up on a chase and apply gen pressure. If it‚Äôs a SwF then of course they‚Äôre coordinating what you‚Äôre doing, so you wasting a shit ton of time chasing one guy will obviously give them time to pop a shit ton of gens. When it‚Äôs solo q, and the killer hits me once and eventually abandons chase I know he knows what he‚Äôs doing especially if it‚Äôs someone like Trapper, Hag, Legion, killers that should rotate constantly. 
---
If I hit a survivor and that survivor gets to a really good jungle gym area I‚Äôm the real dumbass to chase him throughout it then complain about genrush when I finally down him.
---
Depends on the survivor.  A super salty TTV is totally worth it.
---
one has haunted the dreams of children since ancient times in japan, and the other is the oni brand new killer in dbd.
---
If the fastest way to do the missions is to troll your teammates it's what you would call bad design.
---
One time I moried a friend in a custom game because he exposed us with haunted ground 1 match before
---
Yes, I don‚Äôt care about ranking or escaping. I don‚Äôt have to get a 4K every game to be satisfied. Most the time if I do something funny or creative /hard I‚Äôm happy with how I played. I do think that only people who are not optimable at killer use noed to get a kill or two, you may disagree. But that‚Äôs how I feel.
---
If my game lasts 2 mins because I was mori'd. I still say gg. I am so over being upset at this game tbh.
---
I play both sides, but mainly survivor. It honestly doesn't matter what change is made, it's almost going to make someone unhappy. Survivors and killers both have their list of gripes. Imagine buying a killer like Legion and then having them gutted 6 months later. Killers get the shit end of the stick too.
---
The bigger picture is that a game like this is impossible to balance, but at least the devs are trying to tweak things to improve that balance. If you look at the state of the game now compared to what it was like in the past, we're in a much better place. Yes, there are still things that need to be seriously looked at, and people should continue being vocal about things if they are significant issues.
---
I'm a BL user, and have been for about 95% of all games I've played. I'll be affected by this change as much as anyone, so I've been trying to use it less in the games that I play. After having it just be a part of the way I played for so long, it is difficult to make the changes I need to, but I've been finding ways to make it work so far. Will I lose more chases if I continue playing the way I always do? Definitely, but I know that there are plenty of people out there that get by just fine without BL, and I think I can get there too.
---
Again, I understand it sucks when something you base your playstyle off gets changed or nerfed, but this game will continue to evolve and change over time, so you can't get too attached to anything. You have to decide if you want to let that affect your enjoyment of the game, or if you're going to keep playing because you enjoy other aspects of the game enough.
---
IMO they're both pretty bullshit, both are designed to ignore the other game mechanics to secure a win. Granted there are cases were there won't be much of a difference (i.e a survivor opening the hatch 2 seconds earlier with a key when the killer is on the other side of the map, killer moring the last survivor while the next hook would kill them, etc).
---
&gt; Some of the challenges are too situational and rely on luck
---
100% this. For example, the one killer challenge i have left is to sacrifice a survivor during the endgame collapse.  that is such a major pain in the ass
---
This and not only tall, he's loud! You can hear his footsteps on the other side of walls making mind games a bit harder.
---
Yes you can have an opinion, but nerfs... Killer mains were born in it, raised by it, molded by it. Killers get nerfed way more than survivors. Prime example is legion. Another example is Freddy, (took a year and half to fix) I know survivor perks get nerfed drastically, I get it but they should. Survivors shouldn't be able to withstand ANY killer alone. Not in the slightest
---
Can you recommend one for Android? I only make memes at work &gt;.&gt;
---
I just dont think its that big of a deal
---
His 180 degree flick is pretty much a guaranteed down.
---
Catch ur pets!
---
Just because they stated they‚Äôre testing them doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not live. No one said they weren‚Äôt bug free because they definitely are. I doubt they‚Äôll turn them off at this point, they just fix things on the backend like they have been. I do think they need more communication on the type of servers as it seems like they‚Äôre not telling us because they‚Äôre probably only 20 tick rate servers.
---
survivors; no, that's not how you're supposed to play this game!
---
Hex: Pretty Good Job So Far
---
The one i use is android-iphone. It‚Äôs Pixiv.
---
i'll probably be downvoted for this, but isn't the PTB (Player Test Build), for testing, and the devs ask for feedback?
---
You don't care about ranking, you recognize the game isn't over when gens complete.
---
This is all a you problem then.
---
Noed is fine, it is counterable and 100% up to survivors whether or not it even activates.
---
"survivor mains"
---
"killer mains"
---
...lol
---
do people really only play one side exclusively? if you played both you'd realize that all this survivor vs. killer salt is total nonsense. there are balance issues across the entire game, not just for one "side."
---
If you read my concept, I think it would balance fine.
---
And there goes borrowed. Banning perks will never work and banning killers just makes the killer dodge the lobby. Theres a reason people have mains, this isn't league wheres theres variety of options and counters. Your idea is bad and you should feel bad.
---
I PLAYED AGAINST AN EXTREMELY TOXIC BUT ALSO VERY GOOD 4 MAN SFW GROUP WITH 1 FLASHLIGHT AND 3 TANK-A-HIT MED KITS WHO WERE TBAGGING ALL THE TIME AND AFTER I GOT 2 OF THEM THEY SPAMMED ME WITH INSULTS, SO I DECIDED TO PLAY SURVIVOR AND PLAYED AGAINST ONE OF THEM, OF COURSE PRAYER BEADS SPIRIT WITH THE USUAL PERKS AND A GREEN MORI.
---
I mean if Freddy can be a diddler and also a killer, why not him?
---
CAUGHT!
---
Kill
---
I've taken a six month break from this game and just came back, are you people seriously asking for punishments for tunneling AKA kill rushing or am I misunderstanding the sentiment on this sub?
---
This one wasn't too bad run noed and blood warden or you can slug the second last survivor kill the 4th and close hatch then sacrifice the last guy.
---
It sucks but sometimes you got to do what you got to do.
---
Find a wall. Maps are full of em.
---
Little too fast? Nah he already has the worst early game possible like Micheal
---
Where can I learn such power?
---
lol that actually sounds like a fun way to play
---
yeah, obviosly the list is (best on top obviously)
---
bubba
---
legion

---
freddy
---
hillbilly

spirit
---
nurse
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the problem is then... huh. I hope you figure it out!
---
It's in the comments :)
---
I haven't really been experiencing many frame drops lately.
---
The only things that seem to directly cause frame drops are certain killers powers when combined with bad ping, poor Wi-Fi, and loading in indoor maps.
---
Clown isnt powerful even with tons of practice
---
It was meant to counter the no heal gen rushing meta
---
My detailed concept is in the comments. And the chapter would have more than just the T-800 ;)
---
That's one of the easier ones to complete. Closing the Hatch starts the End Game Collapse.
---
Slug the survivors, sacrifice all but one. Find the hatch and close it, hook and sacrifice the last survivor.
---
There were god loops on a few of the machmillan maps, hawkins, all the preschool maps, and swamp. They werent infinite but they were extremely strong. With BL how it was every map the devs made they had to be wary of any raised surface they wanted to put in.
---
*insert Michael myers default dance*
---
It‚Äôs mainly a trend I‚Äôve noticed by playing, which is purely anecdotal; however, it makes sense and is not uncommon to see NOED on a killer who the player thinks will have trouble 4K‚Äôing before endgame, I. E. Doc or legion.
---
I am proud of these meme because it didn't rely on Noed banter, camping or tunneling. You just laid it flat. I appreciate that.
---
Play against a decent killer and say this please, you brainlet
---
NOeD iZ Op PLeAse NErf. WhY ShOUld I dO TotEm? NoBodY ElsE DO TotEm! KIlLErs a BUnCH oF BAbys. iLL DC If I WaNT DoNT tELL me HoW TO PlAY!
---
My first response to you was that I don‚Äôt think NOED is a problem. 
---
I just think that as killer if you depend on it you‚Äôre hurting yourself at getting better at the game.
---
Why can‚Äôt survivors use perks they like? God forbid we use a strong perk.  Not like ruin and bbq and half killer perks got buffed lol
---
Supposedly gives an increasing time-out after each DC, eventually leading to a permaban if they don't stop once going through the full progression a few times.
---
However, some people are reporting that they can't get hit with the penalties no matter what they do in the PTB.
---
ghostface isn't wearing a costume from a movie though. the black cloak is the "fun world" Halloween costume that you can buy irl every year, the costume designers on scream made specifically different cut cloaks, for instance the movie cloak doesn't have spiky arm pieces it instead has 4-5 long strips, movie cloak doesn't have a split in the leg or a tie in the middle.
---
I've been playing this game for two years but I just recently bought it on PC after not playing for a while, and I bought the game on the 13th so I was getting fucked
---
No man, you ban the perk, not the survivor. And it becomes unusable for all the survivors. It would push players to play other styles and not only the usual "ds, borrowed, balanced/dh, adrenaline" (same for the killer)
---
That‚Äôs a bear sir
---
Never once when i played killer I had a problem with BL
---
thanks for the advice! as you can probably tell, i'm not a very good killer! i'll have to keep that in mind for my next attempt.
---
you're not reading the thread. a person replied saying that what i'm experiencing is "because of dedicated servers," implying that these issues would be fixed once they're live. they've been *testing* dedicated servers on pc and dead hard is still glitched, meaning that these issues aren't fixed (neither are hitting through pallets/windows). these servers will literally never see the light of day once the devs decide they're done, "testing," them.
---
not everyoneüò≥
---
She looks life if Hibana and Thermite from Siege had a baby
---
There‚Äôs no redemption possible for this kind of people.
---
Probably impersonators of BHVR members
---
David's groans when he's injured is so freaking loud.  Finally getting Iron Will on him made such a difference.
---
They will eventually bring in a robot or cyborg mark my words. They already have Terminator in death garden.  I would love a T 1000 playing with his theme in chase. A future war map. Even a T 800 chasing you would be sick. I think it's going to happen. Before GF was leaked in game  some sounds leaked before he was seen  They never used some  of  the sounds in his leak. Very robot or machine like sounds. Look at last chapter that we all thought the Nun was coming thanks to a leaked lobby music. It def was not used for Oni.  I think the Nun is next and then it will be some type of machine after that. Just my guess.
---
freddy?
---
He should just get a huge magnet to get them all.
---
Literally play him on Lerys or Hawkins. Close quarters is the best counter
---
YOU COULD ASK THE KILLER IF THEY LET YOU BLIND THEM 2 TIMES AND LET THEM KILL YOU AFTER THAT. I AM ALWAYS FINE WITH THAT DEAL
---
Most of the Survivors are obnoxious with their injured sounds.
---
And then there's Ace.
---
stupid rules are stupid agreed OP
---
so does billy but they might make minor changes to the hitbox range for oni and you have to remember this is the ptb things aren't final
---
There is nothing beta about Bill, ok?
---
It was spirits ancestor, you thought about it to hard lmao
---
But billy has to re-rev for every single sharp turn, Oni can run along walls or run into them and he keeps running.
---
KWF team for sure.  Most likely impersonating.  People can be so rude and take a game too serious. Ugh
---
Claudette cutie gang gang!
---
He wasn't ever even ona ptb, he got launched and then nerfed in two weeks. Dark times punkdemoicano dark times.
---
I‚Äôd imagine there‚Äôs just some weab in the BHVR design team who likes traditional japanese horror, and the connection between an Oni and a vengeful ghost was more of an afterthought than anything. Still cool for the lore.
---
It is the same format, read it again dumbass
---
*David gets downed cause she cleansed haunted*

---
Not really, I‚Äôve seen it at least twice
---
Why the hell did they change Legion‚Äôs duration add-on items? Is a tenth of a second really that big of a deal?
---
What do you think perks are for? You keep saying the words "relying" and "Depending". This is getting tiring tbh because I feel like im just gonna keep repeating myself.
---
I think noed is fine. It is 100% dependant on survivors whether or not it even activates. It is an endgame perk that has alot of counterplay and is hardly even good. 
---
You think people shouldn't rely on a perk to help get a potential kill or even 4. You think it makes killers worse at the game if they use it.
---
We can agree to disagree.
---
Yeah well they shouldn't have marketed so hard, even as going far as removing one of the swords from yamaoka estate.
---
Wtf really?
---
it's difficult to counter Hillbilly too, especially with Enduring and Brutal Strength/Spirit Fury. that doesnt make him OP. in fact, my standard is that if the killer isnt stronger than Hillbilly, then he doesnt need a nerf.
---
and from what I've seen so far, Oni looks like Hillbilly lite. perhaps 1 or 2 ways he's better but those are more than countered by his requirement to injure someone, then collect blood before he even has any power at all. whereas Billy can insta-down everyone at all times right from the get go.
---
Pallets or windows? Just looping him in ptb was fine until I ran into a tree or something
---
I wish they would introduce new objectives or modes. The generator stuff gets old
---
u/peanits What happened?
---
Great bait mate! I rate 8/8
---
It seems like they intend to explore survivors and killers in the rift. We got more detail about a survivor and killer recently, so it seems straightforward that they'll eventually have their own rift.
---
Lol ya and he also has to work for his power as where billy doesn't jesus I bet you haven't even gone against the Oni just watch videos.
---
Killer struggling, protecting their totems, and the obvious unnatural speed up after gens are powered
---
it's obvious they do it on purpose, too. I saw zero complaints about Spirit before the nurse nerf happened. then within 48 hours of the announcement of those nerfs, all the forums were suddenly filled with "Spirit is OP and has no counterplay!"
---
The only reason he did all that is because he wanted to go home and get his uniform. 
---
Bill is hard as fuck
---
was there a ruin totem nearby?
---
I dont honestly see that playstyle being run super heavily. I've seen a handful doing like no mother, resilience, etc. in a build but none of them actually survive or do well. People that run around injured all game put themselves at a risk as is, nonetheless if they get interrupted with a scream and have the exhaustion debuff applied to completely ignore one of their perks. It would be like a perk for survivors blocking all Hex perks for 45 seconds any time they took a hit. It's too much punishment for one side for too little effort by the other side.
---
I mean yeah that seems the direction they are going, honestly with how much I love the oni from a design and lore perspective I actually hope there is at one point some deeper connection between the two.
---
"I got the hook save! Oh, wait! Oh god... oh no! This is horrible! Its the Wraith's mori!"

That is nabstablook?
---
But if you‚Äôre a full grown man in a Party City mask, go for it!
---
You asked. If you really don‚Äôt see how your comment was off topic for the DBD subreddit then nobody can help you dude.
---
I saw this already but this did it better
---
A MASK?  I LOOKS LIKE A PAINTING LOOL
---
well yea... it was a teaser to let everyone know the next killer was related to the spirit.
---
i don‚Äôt know, but i‚Äôm saying it hasn‚Äôt been perfected yet, and that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt jump to conclusions about him
---
When he cuts, everyone else cries
---
I mean, I personally think Billy is one of the better designed killers and definitely the best designed high tier killer, but his strength doesn't come from the instant down, it comes from him being able to move so quickly. The instant down is a nice bonus, but he'd still be higher tier even if his only ability was moving really really fast with no real drawback.
---
He's not really broken either considering all the other high tiers he's *very* fair
---
Is there a cap at how many traps can be active at once?
---
You new around these parts? Lemme give some backstory. WAY back when, when freddy was first on the ptb he was pretty decent mid-tier killer. However, an overwhelmingly minority of survivor mains took to reddit and spammed the devs about how broken he was immeditely after he was released.
---
As a result of poor planning and a lack of a spine, BHVR caved and gutted what was already a middling killer. Then he was left as the worst killer in the game for nearly an entire year. We DO NOT , want that to happen to another killer, period.
---
Just loop him 4head
---
Well you see, I was having a stroll and all of a sudden I had an epiphany. I stopped in my tracks and realized I had to make the perfect meme for reddit. I turned around and sprinted home,  pushing bystanders aside and hurdling over moving cars as I couldn't wait for them to let me cross. I kicked down my door as I didnt have the time to fiddle with my keys, ran to my computer and spent days looking through every meme template available. And finally, I found it and that's how this came to be.
---
Wraith I guess.

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
If the killer has Stridor then it counters Iron Will and you still make noises.
---
KEEP TRYING, ONE DAY YOU'LL GET IT. I NEEDED ~40 ATTEMPTS AND FINALLY GOT IT ON L√âRYS, USING TWO COMMON ADD ONS AGAINST SWF AND ONE OF THEM EVEM ESCAPED
---
My rank means nothing. Granted I‚Äôve been playing for years now, rank 1 typically. Thousands and thousands of hours on it.  Why do people bring up rank?  I can‚Äôt like my perk? And feel that survivors get nerfed into oblivion to cater to killers?
---
you think fredy isn‚Äôt an a tier? lol ok
---
Anal beads ahoy
---
Yeah, all might be a bit over kill, but these were just a couple ways I thought you could speed up his gameplay, and make him feel nicer to play
---
I thought we would see Rins father as a survivor for spilling the blood of a Yamaoka. And that way Rin could have her revenge on him also. The new girl is cool and all but I was just hoping for more backstory on the father. What the whispers were, was he to become a killer but the Entity changed its mind? They could have played with it a little.
---
She looked more like Feng before they changed her.
---
Baah
---
i always hate playing against the wraith (nothing wrong with him, just a personal preference), but i have noticed that in all my matches against him, at least 1-2 people make it out every time.
---
There is a set number you start with and on the map so yes there is a cap.
---
TESTIFY!
---
IF MYERS GETS HIS INFINITE MORI SHIT, YOUR TEAMATES ARE TO BLAME, I CANNOT SAY HOW MANY TIMES SURVIVORS JUST STOOD THERE LETTING ME GET ALL THEIR CREAMY EVIL WITHIN.
---
The best killer mains even say he‚Äôs OP. So stop saying survivor mains are just ‚Äúcrying‚Äù. Survivors having to learn how to counter him will just take time but nobody‚Äôs thinking about what that says about how easy Oni is to pick up and do well with, considering he has only been out for like a day. Top survivor mains say he‚Äôs OP, top killer mains say he‚Äôs OP. Sounds pretty clear to me. However from what I‚Äôve seen all this guy needs is less blood orbs or some sort of small stagger when bumping into objects depending on the angle you hit it at( not stopping the charge completely), kinda like accidentally shoulder checking the environment but still going. He would still feel like the powerhouse he is.
---
Yah but any attempt at discussion is usually meant with contempt or little to no response so it scares some people off so they just make with teh memes.

Maybe, but 30 sec is way too little. Then you can only absorb them mid-chase. They should stay for a few minutes
---
If we‚Äôre talking no add ons probably Hillbilly. He can punish mistakes super hard and has insane map pressure but if survivors know what they‚Äôre doing they can turn him into an M1 killer with high mobility
---
Michael
---
OOOOOH... SO THAT IS HOW I LOST THAT PURPLE FLASHLIGHT...
---
His ability breaks pallets.
---
Nono... Go ahead. Cry more and tell us what's wrong with the killer trying to win.
---
You're nothing more than a crybaby survivor pissed that their powerful perk got nerfed and now you actually have to try a little harder.
---
Yeah, found it, wait...
---
God #DAMNITHAUNTEDGROUNDS!
---
Oh so you want an add on to add more traps to the map?
---
same, dude. It's just cancer honestly I love this game and remember all those great nights or afternoon on it. But it's just getting me upset.
---
This literally could not be more sarcastic
---
No other exhaustion perk gives you a benefit when exhausted. Why should BL?
---
His ability breaks pallets, and you can't spam windows.

You don't need a Terminator with a gun. Way to OP and boring. My idea was a T 1000 and his power would be extended lunge range thanks to his morphing and maybe turn in to a item on the map. Like a fake gen or something. Maybe be able fake being a survivor. Idk. Just my thoughts. There are so many killers they could use. I was thinking the other day that next gen of systems are coming. I think they are probably working on a DBD 2 in secret. Bring over original killers they own and have a new fresh batch of license killers. I'm curious how long DBD will be played till DBD 2. If they want to be super cheap they could just keep updating 5he DBD grafix so they don't have to relicense. I would love Pin Head, Terminator, original Freddy,, Pyramid Head from SH
---
Did the killer have stridor?
---
Tell that to the people who do gens in 4 minutes.
---
lol no point to aruge with these fools who have watched videos but haven't actually played in the ptb. All this bitching from ppl who haven't even gone against him gonna get him nerfed despite the fact he is just an A tier killer but of course they want him to be useless god forbid we have a fun good tier killer.
---
gotta get more XP so you can level up your Weeb Skill
---
i would say a slightly stronger version of billy is the model the devs should use for all future killers.
---
Billy is the closest thing we have to 100% fair. the only change he needs is his insta saw. 
---
I say he is perfect bc he is fun for everyone, fun to go against, fun to play as, has a high skill cap but easy to pick up ect. He feels like a test from both the killer and survivor. 
---
I do feel like a team of 4 amazing survivors has the advantage though, so thats why i say a slightly better version
---
Oni doesn't care about corners. He dashes towards you, you turn around the corner and he flicks the dash around the corner too and hits you. You should see some gameplay of skilled players like Zubat play him. Its a little too insane how the flick works. I think you can even do a 180 slam
---
Only in the ptb. New female characters usually have megs voice at first but get their own voice actress.
---
lol yea kinda like shower thoughts basically. Stuff like why does word bed have the shape of a bed and was the on purpose?
---
A few minutes can be a long time. Not to mention the frequency of orbs spawning in. Maybe 45 seconds or a minute.
---

SpongeBob truly never ceases to amaze by its meme potential for any given topic.
---
If so many people are already 'jumping' to conclusions, that kinda says something about his balance.
---
TRAPPER SHOULD BE IMMUNE TO HIS TRAPS!
---
THERE; TRAPPER NOW HAS A QOL CHANGE THAT MAKES HIM A BIT STRONGER, TOOK ME ALL OF 7 SECONDS TO THINK ABOUT IT:
---
Much faster than doing a gen, and the orbs dissappear after a while. He also has to go over to the orbs and collect them like Trapper with his traps
---
Idle crow squawking on the top.
---
literally every new killer ever has been complained about in the ptb
---
he got re-worked a year after his nerf, so NOW he‚Äôs A-tier. please read the backstory this man is clearly trying to give you as you‚Äôre showing that he‚Äôs right...you‚Äôre clearly new around here
---
You shouldn‚Äôt stand that close to the last guy in hook. The game still counts it as facecamping and it can prevent you from getting a 4pip.
---
Base Billy is pretty close to a balanced killer. Also, Myers.
---
Who the fuck cares about rank anyways? Also so its ok for a 4 man swf group to finish a match in 4 minutes its all honky dory but when a killer ends it quick its somehow ruins the match? The double standards sure are egerious.
---
oh, you mean when he was first released? yeah, they nerfed him to shit
---
DS first or Head On first?
---
So he's a more powerful Billy? Good think he has to work for his ability and not get it whenever he wants. So in conclusion he's fair we just need to learn
---
Yes, and the Legion is an example of being broken after PTB.
---
I really dont see too many orbs even when all survivors are injured so I dont really think its a problem. I'd like to know the time it takes for them to vanish tbh. I think the problems with Oni lays in his actual power and not the build up
---
Very true. Once I played a toxic streamer who clicked and teabagged; I sacrificed him and he went total rage mode on his stream. It was hilarious
---
Except this is a Legion that is like 2 times faster, can break pallets, and can't vault windows the same speed as survivors.
---
He can literally run around the wall and one hit. Particularly at L walls. If you're hiding behind some random wall, you're dead anyway.
---
He tried to scratch them with his glove on. Ouch.
---
/s
---
do we have a rule against wojacks being posted here?
---
I don't get it unfortunately.
---
correct. we don‚Äôt want another killer nerfed to the ground like poor freddy was üò≠
---
The Killer is your opponent. Your opponent does not care about your fun.
---
I really don't understand why I need to say this so often.
---
so like every other killer?
---
Not as far as I've seen
---
Judith's Journal.  Lets you stalk the living shit (considerably) out of the obsession.  Normal stalk on others.  Nemesis means all are the obsession.  I have an erection.  A very, very sharp erection.
---
&gt;Why do people bring up rank?
---
Because people who play at decently high ranks, especially rank 1, know how to punish face camping and tunneling. Hard. You can do gens to apply pressure and bring the camper away or it‚Äôll cost him the game, run borrowed time and/or decisive strike, take hits, or loop the killer long enough that tunneling becomes detrimental compared to chasing survivors off gens. 
---
You can feel however you want about the game and like whatever perks you want, I also love BL and it‚Äôs easily my most used exhaustion perk; regardless, there is a clear and justified reason for it being nerfed besides BHVR apparently bowing down to killer mains. In addition, I can disagree and give numerous reasons why I believe your feelings are misplaced while you can respond or ignore me. Seems fair to me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I would gladly remove this post if you can link me to the supposed original
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs faster than doing a gen, but still takes time. Also, the orbs take a while to disappear. Longer than it should take. And unlike Trapper, he doesn‚Äôt have to pick up each individual item. Oni just sucks them all up instantly and simultaneously.
---
Its because you have will of iron
---
Fuck yes.  That was one of the first things I said when I started playing. Right after being disappointed the nurse didn‚Äôt look more silent hill. I can‚Äôt upvote this enough. üñ§
---
Base kit are Billy and Hag
---
I think he has HUGE eyes
---
Ofcourse Glenn was loveable and always loyal to Rick but Abraham was funny and we didn‚Äôt have a lot of funny character before that. 
---
Yeah the negan whisperer stuff is cool, can‚Äôt wait to see him fight Beta.
---
Instead of learning how to juke legion. You should learn to film properly. And you can record on xbox btw
---
Why the teabag, tho
---
Yes just loop him he‚Äôs a m1 killer so you can
---
No, I just prefer being the only one of a certain survivor on a team. Used to play quentin a lot, maybe that's why.
---
The game penalizes us for camping. And it results in us losing if survivors play smart.
---
I now regret all the Quentin face roast comments I made.
---
Forgive me peanits

Sure it's been posted but this is the best use of this meme so far.

U right, I just got excited didn't know how to express it

The perk rewards killer for hooking surivors and punishes surivors for not healing

But you have scratch mirror *guitar music starts

---
no, you counter SF by dropping early, and denying this 1 HS you speak of
---
there are plenty of pallets and windows, relax and abuse the main building
---
Lmao. Remember when freddy got released on the ptb and people called for nerfs. Apparently they dont
---
Yeah me as well. I think Glenn still should‚Äôve died but only Abe should‚Äôve died that night by negan. Glenn should‚Äôve  died some other way. Would‚Äôve loved to see both of them deal with alpha
---
What? I'm confused
---
proud of her
---
Otz‚Äôs video already shows some ways to counter it, or maybe he just wasn‚Äôt used to the oni
---
This might sound outrageous, but I think Trapper should be able to tamper with lockers &amp; chests.
---
So head on first to make the most of it
---
I feel like if only Abraham died it would‚Äôve been underwhelming. Don‚Äôt forget we had to wait like 5 months for that lol
---
oink
---
that's true, to a degree. But in all of my multiplayer games, few communities are as contentious as Dead by Daylight's.
---
BRUH
---
Don't think that's how it works
---
Repost!
---
Hard to tell what happened here, but did you teleport into a locker upstairs?
---
If this is your low effort comic then I'm afraid to see your best.
---
Great stuff btw
---
It works perfectly well with the Nightmare remake and the ‚Äúmicro‚Äù sleep. To the point Freddy was blending into the real world for those that remained
---
There is a way to watch for them safely, though I'm not knowledgeable enough with survivor to say what that is. Some loops are safer than others of course, so you might be kinda screwed no matter what depending on the loop. Also, part of it is learning to play the player. So the killer you're facing is doubling back. Does he double-double back, or usually just does the one? Does he stall/stand still, or is he usually always moving? Does he try to hide his red stain? Absorb as much information as you can on who you're playing against and use it. Also know that a good killer is doing this with you as well, so be sure to mix up your own playstyle so you don't become predictable and let the killer capitalize on that.
---
use black border around white text to increase readability :)
---
&gt; MISC QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGE - Traps can no longer be sabotaged
---
No, unless I'm  misunderstanding. I've seen where gens don't have all sides approachable and the trapper has placed traps on the two sides that were approachable. 
---
You can also trap the only approach to your totems. Traps on gates.
---
Survivors need the chance to disarm them.
---
Yes it does. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that your opponent is not responsible for your fun. It‚Äôs not even relevant to the point.
---
Camping is a valid strategy, albeit a bad one. There are circumstances when you want to do it, but for the most part a Killer should aim away from camping.
---
But to say ‚ÄúSurvivors don‚Äôt have fun!‚Äù is the wrong argument. The Killer shouldn‚Äôt have to care if the Survivors have fun and vice versa.
---

Thank you for the bloodpoints sounds more toxic than GG, in my opinion.  I dunno, unless you got some crazy amount with multiple BPS/Gateaus that's gonna come across as sarcastic or as a putdown, like "the only worthwhile thing about that match was the bloodpoints, not the experience or the sport of it."
---
BAM  BAM
---
i suggest Red Pyramid as much as i can because i doubt we'll ever get another "real" Silent Hill game. hed be fucking bad ass in the fog since its what hes used to
---
Get downed and hooked because the devs refuse to do anything about camping other then make shitty conditional perks.
---
This is supposed to be used ironically, so invert the order of the text side.
---
he joined the whisperers thooo
---
They are all balanced tho a few are trash
---
im not positive, but, im pretty sure impersonating devs are a bannable offense.
---
If you got enough time to make it to another loop, absolutely run for it. Also, on the topic of being unpredictable, if you've been running a killer around a loop for awhile, he might not expect you to leave it. It's certainly happened to me as a killer. I wouldn't try this often, but do remember that it is something you can pull out of your bag of tricks.
---
You punish him slugging by using unbreakable and rush it‚Äôs not hard it‚Äôs like fighting Myers and billy don‚Äôt feed him his power and don‚Äôt get caught in the open it‚Äôs not hard.
---
Sweet, ty!

Not familiar with American military slang what is a ‚Äúsquid‚Äù

This meme format is a bad idea, and your spelling atrocious.
---
Yeah, no problem! :) welcome!
---
Definitely Billy without instasaw. If all killers were around his level i would actually be worried as a survivor.
---
He can instantly down you again, then you're SOL bc he'll have his ability again. It's basically an un clenseable, better NoED.
---
Not everything is about tier listings. Freddy was extremely annoying to play against. If 80% of the lobby isn't having fun, then something is wrong. If you should criticize anything, it should be how long it took BHVR to rework him. I don't have any issues with him anymore but original freddy, even after the nerf, made me stop playing for a long time.
---
I missed oompa loomoa memes
---
Ash's model looks pretty good imo.
---
Stop relying on Ruin. It's shit.
---
You know too much
---
No, but after next patch it's going to get punished
---
They should‚Äôve actually gave his base form a useful and interesting ability so all the focus isn‚Äôt on blood fury
---
It‚Äôs a playful derogatory nick name for someone in the navy. Like how Marines say army stands for ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt Ready to be Marines Yet‚Äù or someone calling Marines Crayon eaters or jarheads, or people in the Air Force the cheer force, or desk squad.
---
They should have done a lot of things.
---
He belongs in death garden.
---
Cool cosplay btw! Love huntress
---
It's just feng in a sluttier outfit... oh wait
---
Hits through window, curves around jungle gyms, shits on both dead hard and unbreakable, and just don't get hit 4head

He gains half his bar from a normal hit.

Why that is the cutest cut up schoolgirl I have ever seen.

I am now in a list, and so are you for reading it.

I'm honest: my art is bad, so I lower expectations and still manage to disappoint.
---
Of course it does, why wouldn't it?
---
Now I heard this twice in this post, how do you guys know that? XD
---
Sometimes I DH at the start of the lunge and still get hit
---
Didn't mods say this was over-saturated content? What happened to that
---
I mean he's literally the best killer to date, 2 forms of insta downs, Billy mobility, easy tracking, near insta pallet breaks, sick mori. 
---
If his charge wasnt an insta down he might be more "balanced" but to anyone who thinks he's fine as is please brush up on game balance
---
You fucking loop then his turning is great but it can‚Äôt tightly loop jungle gyms or windows so abuse it
---
to be fair adrenaline rewards you for doing your objective completely
---
NOED rewards you for failing your objective (which is of course to stop survivors from completing all the generators)
---
!Remindme 2 days
---
Lots of missed opportunities with this killer here
---
I'm a killer main mostly. BL never bothered me. Please don't start the Us vers them arguments. Let's be in general. BL on certain maps was OP. Just like Spirt PBs was OP. It's ok to buff and nerf.  I play survivor enough to see how fucking annoying camping and tunneling is.  But here is the thing. You can't tell someone in a game who is your opponent how to play against you. You are going to have shit head killers who don't know any better or suck so bad that they troll doing it. However on the killer side of things the amount of DCs is crazy. Like 4 out of 10 games have a DC.  It sucks. So the devs finally are doing something about it. Good.  I used to bitch about the killer struggle. Now I play survivor daily and see their struggle. I think the game is slowly starting to become better. As for tunneling and camping. Well it sucks. What can BHVR do about it? What is your idea to stop killers who tunnel or camo? I'm curious. I think it's just one of those things that are out of your control so don't let it bother you. I can't tell survivors that if you face me you can't be on comms!

Oh? Is that good or bad haha yeah it's a full, wearable, adult mask
---
If you look closely, Claudette is in this comic
---
Oh I guessed that... It's just a lot of people give stupid advice about tunnelling and camping, but all it does is make people rage quit - because it's frustrating - which ruins the game for everyone else. Doing it at the start of a match just is not worth it.
---
As a killer you gotta try and play around what makes people DC. Play survivor and you'll know what makes them DC. Gotta try and find a balance between kicking their ass and making them feel they have a chance lmao. Otherwise they just leave.
---
Wow ohh well guess he‚Äôs broken because of a perk
---
Why can‚Äôt we grab half a survivor in two trials? Smh my head BHVR has gone too far this time
---
Just play spirit or scratched mirror myers.
---
Yeah unless the killer is camping, 'tunneling' is generally a survivor behavior problem. From a survivor standpoint I get why it's frustrating, but you have to hate the game and not the player. Complaining to your *opponent* for not handicapping themselves for your benefit is just weird; it's no different than a killer getting mad that survivors didn't 99% each gen instead of finishing the one they're on because the match is going too quickly for the killer.
---
Just played against THREE Insidious Bubbas yesterday at rank 1. They're definitely everywhere. It's easy to win (by kills, not by pipping or BP) especially if it's not a SWF, because you're nearly guarenteed for that first person to fall for it. Then you have 2 basement hooks to facecamp. Easiest 4k strategy in the game, it's so fucking stupid. Insidious needs a full rework or just needs to be deleted. It's not fun (for either side, unless you enjoy not playing the game) it's not skillful, its uncounterable. Literally nothing positive about that perk. 
---
Facecamping in general needs to be prevented somehow, but that's a complicated fix. Insidious is not a complicated fix.
---
I think in true christmas spirit, Leatherface should get Quentin a new face.
---
No, I'm talking about the shitty example you gave about healing in random spots.
---
'Score hidden'
---
The whole intention of slug play was probably intended to make his power weaker as he loses it, but just creates crazy slug builds. Either way it‚Äôs better for the killer if he doesn‚Äôt lose power as he can open lockers in ability, also hook if he can‚Äôt find anyone.
---
He's strafes around walls once you learn the movement and flick It's much easier once you bind it to specfic keys like Q and E. Once you realise that and how much easier it is than curving with Billy. You shut down loops really easy. If they make to the pallet, you break it faster than Brutal Strength or Billy chainsaw while dashing. Unbreakable is not really counter since he will have the team down in mere minutes of the game. You'll just prolong the match by another minute or two.  Also, lol at Iron Will being counter when most Spirits will just listen for movement rather rhan cries of pain. That's not even bringing the fact that most Spirits just bring Stridor now anyway. In conclusion, I love Oni, he's fun as hell, but I don't wanna give survivors a 2 to 3 minute match when I play Oni.
---
Play on Temple of purgation and try this on the multiple locker area. head-on, decisive strike and inner strength I've haven't gotten it to work yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
"ERMAHGERD NERF"
---
Anyways, he's a solid killer thats fun to play, only element that's too strong IMO is his ability to flick at the end of a charge. Does this take skill? Yes in a sense, OhTofu did a video today going over it and if you rebind your keys you can do a 180 turn at the end of a charge and hit behind you and greatly reducing the chance of a survivor dodging or juking. Otz while testing this flick managed to at one point do a huge turn around a wall and hit someone. Only reason i say this is too strong is due to the fact the fatigue from a missed dash hit isn't too long anyways and can still follow up a miss with the short lunge.
---
Aside from that, his M1 lunge hitbox never feels right, the blade always looks like its just out of reach and expecting a lunge feels like you're always an extra second off, who knows could just be servers.  
---
Sorry for the paragraph, just don't wanna see a strong and fun killer nerfed to oblivion when his biggest worry is only a minor tweak away
---
Wait...have they confirmed any changes coming to him after the PTB?
---
PC :p

I‚Äôd like a spider killer that has both trapping and chase powers, with a unique arachnid model.

That‚Äôs how you kill oni

Big brain bait

I gg every game and most survivors are nice. Some get super salty if they lose though.
---
She should have a chainsaw too
---
Name a recent killer who‚Äôs don‚Äôt? They sucked before and they suck after the nerf. No amount of unwhining was making them good.

You delete, and make another comment to counter what I said already, and still make no sense? Kinda sad ngl.

And give her a gun

Hey no fair mom said it was my turn to repost this.
---
3k close the hatch ‚Äúlet the survivor go‚Äù and then pull them off the exit gate.
---
That's why i hate pc kinda wish they also had it for ps4
---
Good, he's a terrible Idea for a killer, should get nerfed into the ground and become useless so they can try again when they disappoint again in 4 months.
---
What‚Äôs this from?
---
I play PS4 and I typically top out at Rank 7 so I'm definitely not on the same level as most of the people on this sub I'm sure. But I feel like I see Freddy as much as I see Spirit over the past week. I genuinely dread seeing the timer over my name these days because I already know my game is going to take ages and most likely I'm not getting out. From a survivor's perspective, Freddy is either a really good killer, or the only Freddy's I run into are very good at the game. It's a miserable experience for me lately.
---
&gt; a few
---
That made me laugh.
---
this is amazing!! shes a beaut, the lighting and pink tones are 10/10 top tier,, bless
---
you're not wrong. problem is, it's the only chance kilelrs have most of the time, since the generators only take 80 seconds barehanded without modifiers, and most levels and the game's basics are designed in ways that allow a mildly skilled survivor to loop for at least 80 seconds easily.
---
Only top tier MS Paint memes here bois
---
God I hope they nerf forever freddy somehow. I dont ever play against it, but I one trick freddy, and I hate the reputation that freddy has for that build.
---
You summed up everything wrong with this killer, better than I did, and you didn't even make the post.
---
Thank god there are people with a brain.

It's not that hard if you choose a killer with undectable powers or perks...or catch a cocky survivor when the gen is at 99%
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dzr7zw/huntress_cosplay_hater_gets_owned/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It's because "most" players take sides and main one or the other.  I agree that it should stop, but I think it  never will. If more people just played every character, then these buffs and nerfs wouldn't hit so hard.  I can't relate to a"legion main" or a "freddy main" or even a killer or survivor main since I play them all(sticking to one is personally boring) I can however imagine if I did, and the game changed totally for me because they nerfed, reworked, or changed my "main" that I would be pretty upset about it.  I don't think it will change, and I get that people like to have the one character they main, but there lies the problem.  No one side will never be 100% happy with an asymmetrical game because it's impossible to please everyone all of the time.
---
I was hoping it would be /deadbygaylight but you do you! üòõ
---
soooo its pretty much /r/deadbydaylight with extra steps?
---
This comic is lovely I really enjoy the shirt changing.
---
It will, feral frenzy is fundamentally broken. They won‚Äôt change the perk just because of legion, and FF won‚Äôt be changed in as quick as 2 weeks. 
---
Unless they disable the perk on legion, it‚Äôs making it to live servers.
---
Aww shes so adorable and totally not going to kill people :3
---
Would‚Äôve been good, but I wanted to include more people !
---
dispite that, it's always great
---
Guys calm down I‚Äôm pretty sure that this is a typo they meant the glitch where killers can see survivors ranks they are removing
---
Yeah I know I was thinking of not mentioning doctor but I did because it seems more scientific than it is magical
---
this is what awake survivors see when someone gets moried by Freddy
---
I like playing as the trapper for these challenges since the archives are based on him. Grabbing people is gonna be tough
---
I mean if you wanna quote mine one time i was being sarcastic thats fine, argument destroyed.
---
Kind‚Äôve gross that people are being rude to LGBT and then being upvoted in these comments :( sometimes we wanna talk to other lgbt calm down
---
like honestly i went against this killer twice AND HE HAD 3 DIFFERENT PERKS THAT ALL SLOW DOWN OBJECTIVE LIKE UGHHHHHHHHH
---
Bro do you even know what sarcasm is? That was some pretty obvious sarcasm.
---
I‚Äôm not defending that either, I actually think that build would be a lot of fun to play with. I was just pointing out that it‚Äôs not fun to play against, same as it‚Äôs not fun to play against 4 commodious toolboxes with perks to power through gens. Don‚Äôt lump me in with the extremists on either side please
---
You could think of it that way, if you want 
---
It‚Äôs like the pig main subreddit, except for LGBT peeps
---
So you're a cunt then
---
I really have to start watching that again I stopped at season 2 but have gotten some spoilers for the stuff ahead. The episodes are so long though..
---
People will be fast to hate on things they don‚Äôt take the time to understand. It‚Äôs the normal; but I do agree the downvotes on this thread are nasty.
---
Ok this is the best one
---
And you are salty :)
---
What the hell? I don‚Äôt defend that shit either. Please don‚Äôt lump me in with extremists here, I was just saying this build wouldn‚Äôt be very fun to play against. I don‚Äôt care if you run it, it‚Äôs probably a blast to play
---
yeah that shit is honestly op all combined.
---
When you think bbq slows the game.
---
How dare he want to change a 5 min game to a 7 min game.
---
You should really just play killer buddy you will quickly find out he‚Äôs balanced
---
They are saying that they get 4ked in a swf and get 0k in a Vs a squad of navy seal survivors.
---
Kate's hair is shook.
---
Jesus Christ guys, circlejerk much? Yeah, a bunch of survivors are assholes. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre an asshole if you run this build, just that it won‚Äôt be fun to play against. Do whatever the fuck you want, enjoy the game.
---
This dog and No0b3 have something in common.
---
Well it works if he can‚Äôt find blood he can‚Äôt go demon I‚Äôve seen it work
---
Its almost always better to hit the unhooker though, unless its post-animation.
---
Hitting the unhooker allows you to turn to the unhooked after the animation and get 2 downs.
---
If you're on xbox then can play and I'll bring borrowed time if you have ds
---
Also artists are super self conscious on their work and will always find flaws with it, especially when theres nothing more they can do before the start to ruin it
---
Oh come on now. Wanting a place to discuss gay stuff with other fans of gay stuff without having to deal with homophobes screaming ‚Äúeww‚Äù at the mere concept is a million miles away from being segregated from society.
---
Hmmm, that's a good point. Perhaps if the mori gave a huge bonus in blood points?
---
Remove self care, its worthless run literally any other perk that gives you healing, even pharmacy
---
Your complaining about one shots fucking pathetic those don‚Äôt do shit when you loop bud and rush just like every other killer
---
The Smudge
---
Easy fix, make it for people who hit r1 faster. Shit players get red ranks with time - not skill. People who make it r1 at the very end of the month after being hardstuck r4, praying to go against purple rank killers just to barely pip shouldn't be rewarded the same as people who get to r1 shortly after rank reset with consistent play. 
---
This whole system is just dogshit.
---
gen slow down meta is so fucking annoying, forever freddy and plague are just so annoying to go against bc it takes you years to do anything. it sucks that they keep adding perks to the slow down meta since no one actually enjoys it.
---
None of this is really addressed to me, is it? I don‚Äôt really care about rank either, that‚Äôs silly. BHVR does a lot of things right, and a lot d things wrong, just like any dev team of any assymetrucal game ever. That‚Äôs the curse of an assymetrical game, it‚Äôs almost impossible to do right. I‚Äôd say that they‚Äôre doin really well for the genre
---
I've noticed that if he cloaks while you're looking at him, you'll have to look away and then look back to reveal.
---
Map offerings. They're green items that show up in the bloodweb sometimes, burn one before the round starts and if your offering is the only one then you'll go to that map. They're not super common though so don't count on having one for every single match.
---
What they have in common?
---
I like to run distortion as a check on whatthe  killer is running, while you often just see BBQ, it‚Äôs good to know if any other perks or add ons such as nurse‚Äôs or scratched mirror are in play.
---
I mean after 20 seconds he should have only 2 slow down perks left.
---
&gt;!Ha ha ha I made a ruin joke, worship me mortals!&lt;
---
Plague throws up anything
---
This is exactly my experience with it as well. Very sad. It could be such an awesome place for in-depth DBD knowledge but it seems like they don't give a fuck. At least now we have Int3r4ct I guess.  
---
I wanted to add some trivia to it that other day and the admin reverted my changes and locked the whole page up.
---
I didn‚Äôt say no one cares about bloodpoints. I was just pointing out that most people don‚Äôt once they‚Äôre past the grind
---
Do you have any cross character perks from Bill? Borrowed Time from him is pretty useful. 
---
Self Care becomes less useful so I'd replace that soon. Balanced Landing is useful but I wouldn't use it with Urban. It helps to level up Bill, Meg, Laurie, David as they have useful perks that are used in most builds. Plunderers isn't useful game to game too.
---
Just play a stealth killer tf? Spirit ghostface, fuck myers even.
---
Thats not what i asked. I like those perks, and reading the adjustments to balanced, its not that bad.
---
BRUH THAT'S THE FUCKING WORST. PEOPLE LITERALLY WERE WATCHING THE TOXICITY AND UNFAIRNESS WHILE YOU HAD TO SUFFER. FUCK!
---
Honestly sounds like you're the salty one lol
---
Hey, may I ask, have you played Pok√©mon Sword Shield (digital)? I've heard that it had a big issue which had a chance of deleting all data... from all games in SD card.
---
you getting face canoed is god's way of punishing your elitism
---
Isnt this post just more whining though? Lol
---
Found the killer that got owned. gg baby killer ez
---
It took me a solid 20 seconds to realize this was a petscop joke
---
yes agreed. bing boi needs some buffs !
---
I fucked up and didn't read the whole thing. I'm dumb.
---
What mommydearest said, sometimes the game likes to glitch out and make me BL from solid ground but that is about it. BL will still work fine unless you're super used to the stumble animation being shorter in that case it'll take getting used to.
---
I feel like this would be interesting, though I'm not sure how it'd be implemented
---
Been rocking lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet, and Ds and it's been great to me
---
I usually use myers and so this immediately went into my mind when I saw nemesis. Should be fun.
---
How dare they!
---
Let me guess everyone else either doing nothing or sitting ten feet away waiting for a window that none of them are willing to make.
---
This is not even hard.
---
Well obviously there aren‚Äôt exactly the same amount of players per role. There‚Äôs likely way more people trying to play killer where you are. Also, I imagine dedicated servers are not be able to accommodate as many lobbies at once as was possible when the was peer to peer, which contributes to killer queue times
---
People typically look down on Self-Care as it's typically a selfish perk. For example you could be causing your team to miss out on altruism dailies, rift challenges or just BP in general. I don't mind it at all so long as they don't let me get to second stage because they're self healing in a corner far away.
---
And you seem to keep missing that, similar to how you keep missing what my comments are about.
---
Yeah but still it's toxic. I play both sides but if someone is defending tbagging then he should have no problem with getting camped or tunneled.  When i play killer i always let survivors save each other and not going after the guy that just got unhooked because i know that it is not fun at all to get camped or tunneled. But when i see a guy that tbag for no reason, i will just camp and tunnel him.
---
Meg has "Fuck me" eyes for trapper haha
---
Fuck Negan.
---
...You can see Ghostface while they‚Äôre in Nightshroud with OoO.
---
Its nerf or nuthing buckaroo
---
I don't dodge lobbies if I'm paired with yellow or brown ranks. It was nice to know what rank everyone was so I could identify the weaker survivors as to help them through the trial. Why remove this???
---
Plague, Huntress, Myers, Hag, and Billy are the most well balanced killers in the game.
---
It might be a little overkill, but honestly look at the hag, she gets 10 traps! And once you go through those 3 traps as trapper you have to go around and pick up 3 more traps, it's a lot of time. 6 might be a tad much, but I think 5 max would be a nice amount, and while you can do this now you need to use both add ons
---
Not only is this sarcastic but literally the point of the PTB is to get community feedback.
---
Depends on the platform, location, and time of day.
---
Eg. I'm in the midwest. If I play on PC, early afternoons provide fast queue times for survivor and slow queue times for killer. Time for killer gets better later in the evening. I imagine that's when a lot of SWFs log in.
---
Opposite experience when I play on PS4 though. A lot more people playing survivors, probably because of the keyboard and mouse aspect you mentioned.
---
People were complaining about spirit since launch and for good reason.
---
I agree. OoO is probably the worst perk to use against stealth killers since it can hinder you by revealing your location to them
---
I would totally second that.
---
Everyone just asserting dominance all over the place I see.
---
You have a point, I don‚Äôt think they need to do anything major but a rank rework/reward system and colorblindness settings have been something I‚Äôve been wanting for a long time.
---
But at the same time, the Entity can also reprogram the T-800 mid time travel and bring it into the realm. Since the Entity mostly feeds on the dying hope of survivors like Sarah Connor, it would have a reason to bring in a machine. To instill fear and hopelessness into the survivors that have been hit with the terrifying reality that they are up against something completely soulless and will stop at nothing to kill them. Feeling no pity or remorse as said in Terminator 1. The lore is not a problem for Terminator x DBD.
---
No. Some people can‚Äôt handle losing to a killer because their precious ego and will rationalize it however
---
Killers don‚Äôt stand a chance against good survivors without using ‚Äúgame slowing‚Äù perks.
---
The legion buff we needed
---
On Your Own and Tight Squeeze sounds pretty overpowered imo
---
That‚Äôs such a scummy reason to dc...
---
‚ÄúI dced to take away 2 kills from the killer who already beat me‚Äù
---
Wrong post?
---
&gt;...You can see Ghostface while they‚Äôre in Nightshroud with OoO.
---
Someone didn't get the memo.
---
Yea, I'll have to when I'm playing killer
---
I kinda figured On Your Own was a little bit, I was debating on keeping the faster gate opening speed or not. And I totally forgot to add a cooldown to Tight Squeeze, it‚Äôs definitely not a perk that can be used multiple times within a few seconds or anything
---
If the killer can afford to face camp at 5 gens then your team is the problem no the killer
---
Sorry dude haven't gotten that game yet so I wouldn't know but what I've heard that have has really mixed reviews
---
Angry motherfucker
---
Eh.  From my experience at least, Keys tend to be rarer on bloodwebs than Moris (I've leveled every Survivor up to at least 40), and Ebony Moris seem to be more common than the purple keys as I've seen quite a few while leveling my Killers up.
---
Green keys are literally just used for aura reading, that's about it.  Dull Keys are primarily designed to get the hatch open.  Skeleton Keys are the ones that are the super powerful ones with the 30s base duration on their aura reading/etc.  
---
Killers can bring Franklin's to knock the keys out of Survivors hands and wear down the durability as well, and it can be hard to find where the key is again since Survivors have to basically find the pick-up prompt and can't rely on easy visuals like Medkits/Toolboxes.  Killers can also close the hatch after it's opened, and the only way Survivors can re-open it is if they have another Dull/Skeleton Key.  
---
Moris meanwhile don't have any sort of way to avoid it beyond Survivors killing themselves, not getting downed after being hooked once, or disconnecting.  
---
Both break the game flow by removing players from the game early to the favor of one side or the other, but Keys are at their strongest when an SWF can coordinate it.  Moris are always at their strongest and have no counter beyond suicide.
---
Killers will only run game slowing perks if they feel they need the help or their pathing is really bad and they got annoyed that 3 gens were done in less than 5 minutes. People should work through Ruin anyway or if they're me; fail the first three ruin skill-checks and run to look for ruin, if i'm on a bad skill check day though.
---
I really hope so too, but survivors only want killers that can easily be pallet looped.
---
I dont know if the issue was fixed. Anyone reviews are not... okay. People are sending 0 just because YES. People are forgetting that a game has to be fun.
---
Killer be like
---
Survivor should not be able to see my aura in 
---
Tier 1 
---
Ambush
---
Shroud
---
Haha
---
Should still  this Dead by Daylight.
---
I think tight squeeze is just a bit much because it can cut 95% of chases in half or just immediately end them, as well On Your Own isn't overpowered because of the faster opening, it's overpowered because on a map like cold wind or red forest, that's an automatic escape.
---
Yeah, they need to do something about both. I‚Äôm just trying to point out to people that it‚Äôs not actually as easy as they seem to think. Colourblind settings probably wouldn‚Äôt be that difficult though, not sure why that one hasn‚Äôt been done
---
Not with the update that happened quite a while ago.
---
How do I run the game in windowed full screen? There's just a box for fullscreen and when unchecked it just runs the game in windowed, not borderless or anything if that's what you mean. I have unchecked the box and the performance is still just as bad windowed.
---
Yep, they cant see the killer but the killer can see them.
---
All those survivors that heal in the corner of the map will suddenly be big brained because the Oni will have to travel to an area with no gens to charge his power.
---
Oh ok. Thank you.
---
Make this a copy paste

In my friends first game we had a Kate on our team and he was like "Why does one of our team look like a hooker?@

He's all kinds of fucked up at the moment, with stalking and being revealed, either of those things working when they shouldn't or not working when they should.
---
It's a good thing there is no incentive. 
---
Imagine the shitshow that would happen if people *wanted* to rank up: nothing but meta killers, forever-perks, and SWF every game.
---
Other games  have casual modes but DBD doesn't have the population to do this.
---
I'm not complaining about them, I'm complaining at the AMOUNT of them there are in this game.
---
Youtube pa$$ion
---
Killers would rather play cheap and lose out on the gens and chase points. Just take solace in that fact
---
It‚Äôs so easy, kill 2 player and farm with the last 2
---
???
---
 I agree. Campers are people who doesn't know how to play the game. When i first started playing killer, i was camping too because i didn't know how to deal with gens. But in high ranks if u camp u lose, good survivors will just sit on gens when they realize that you are camping. Some killers are Just doing it to ruin survivors fun and they're just as toxic as people that tbags for no reason. People should just play both sides and understand why its not fun to play against a camping killer or a toxic survivor.

u/Peanits we love you buddy never ever forget that.

I mean he can literally decorate his leather face, doesnt get more fitting than that.

Hospital escape bill?  I don't know what scarier a Demogorgon with an Ebony mori or bill having an episode of Pstd and killing anything in his path.
---
I‚Äôm bad at spirit but posts like this want to make me main her. Amazing work btw :)
---
He's not
---
He's basically saying the survivors cleanse against the plague then heal when they are not sick which results in a really slow game
---
My biggest gripe with tunneling is Just isnt fun, and its frustrating to get tunneled. 
---
You get off a hook and before you even have a chance to do anything you're down a health state and the killer is already on your ass again, plus it's boring for the other survivors because they're just forced to be gen jockeys until the tunneled dies or somehow loses the killer (but with survivor moaning and blood pools, it ain't happenin)
---
They DC anyway, Spirit or perkless Wraith
---
I can hear the DCs from here.
---
What exactly is the combo? Don't play legion.
---
Are they really doing that?

S a m e

Ahem.... REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

W-what? it was surgery for his knee, and they didn't even get to cutting him open yet. he just got sedated right as zombie ripped through a nurses neck or it was the nurse

 I get this is a joke but who tf uses lightborn
---
Idk they'd probably be about survival and teamwork
---
Of all the things to complain about, this is it? Maybe it would be a good thing for you to play survivor.
---
or look up
---
Oh I'm dumb
---
Nah it‚Äôs just a meme.... for now
---
I be so happy! so many people sleep on the l4d comics. And bill needs some love!
---
The accuracy...
---
To be fair tbagging is toxic during gennys and opening gates but when at opened exit gates, even as killer I have a laugh with the survivors tbagging at the exit gate. Nod and farm a few points with them by hitting and letting them heal each other etc.
---
Ive only seen videos so can't really tell but mb I would decrease the amount of power he get from hitting a survivor but that's it
---
I know it from experience
---
Me: nothing in this game scares me
---
Also me:
---
It warms my heart that this community has grown so large that a joke like this can be recycled so many times without anyone noticing.
---
Ill deny it to the bitter end
---
No marking necessary. This joke is made every fucking time a new chapter comes out.
---
... with 300 confirmed flashlight saves, precisely.
---
Wut?
---
How would Oni  react to the Demogorgon?
---
its probably to help with queue times. cause its a 4 v 1, we need more survivors playing than killers
---
How does stalk depletion work with obsession switching I wonder?
---
Awesome love me some feng min ! ;)
---
but it‚Äôs not the spirit though... it‚Äôs not  blue or cut up or yelling or anything?!?
---
Why do you think Wraith is balanced? He's an M1 killer than can move around kinda fast.
---
Mobile?
---
Aren't most of the maps "home territory" for the killer, as they're controlled by the Entity?  The game spawns killers and survivors simultaneously, but what if that's only a visual representation, and the killer was already there, waiting?  I feel like the trapper should have some prep time after the map is chosen but before the match starts to assess the layout and get some traps set up.  Maybe limited in scope to half the map so survivors aren't spawning into a trapped area.  This might be too much of a hassle to bother programming for only one killer (Hag doesn't need it, as she's basically channeling a curse, not dealing with a physical object).  But who knows.  I like quite a few of your suggestions as well; Trapper can be quite powerful, but using his "power" feels like it's needlessly complicated as it stands now.
---
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO LET YOU HEAL THEM IN 5 SECONDS WITH WE'LL MAKE IT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Same but on xbox
---
It's at least something to do, like trophies and achievements, most of them aren't interesting on their own but when the game is recording your progress, it can add incentive to play, somewhat similar to rank and daily rituals. I realize none of those matter to some players but I see it as better than nothing especially while there are no active tomes.
---
Some killers have addons that completely change their main playstyle (sometimes minor, but also Myers &amp; Doctor's addons)
---
Ok this is pretty good lmao

New Killer Concept; he has a canoe that he lobs across the map, if it lands a headshot, insta mori.

If it could be considered viable then someone will say its OP.

very good recycled meme

Lol yeah I'm playing on PTB on console.

First double killer now this... foreshadow to new gamemode?
---
I mean.... do you have any ideas how to counter him?  If there‚Äôs still no counters after 3 days of people playing for 15-20 hours.... is there a counter?
---
Or did we get cross play and I've been under that huge of a rock this long
---
_Best_ part about his power I think you mean.
---
Or he has a canoe and the map is  a lake with underground generators and all the survivors drown
---
Did haddonfield get reworked?
---
He seems a little underwhelming tbh. I haven‚Äôt played but I‚Äôve seen gameplay. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but he just looks like a billy that has to charge his power. He doesn‚Äôt have anything to help him score that first hit and he needs it to get his power.
---
Nice t bag dude, here's an upvote

I DON'T CARE IF YOU FLASHLIGHT CLICK ME OR CHAIN STUN ME OR LOOP ME. JUST DON'T PLAY HYPER IMMERSED. IT'S LEGIT NOT FUN TO BECOME A GEN KICKING SIMULATOR BECAUSE ALL THE SURVIVORS ARE RUNNING SPINE CHILL AND URBAN EVASION AND I CAN'T FIND ANYONE FOR 2 MINUTES
---
Meg for me
---
Stolen meme
---
What you are experiencing IS because of dedicated servers though. It‚Äôs not dead hard or hit boxes that is allowing you to get hit through it, it‚Äôs latency. They said the servers would be live in the fall and we are well past that. They aren‚Äôt going to go back to P2P at this point, the menu layout and invite functions were updated FOR dedicated servers. So yea you could call it ‚Äútesting‚Äù but that‚Äôs only because they aren‚Äôt fully done tweaking everything that needs to be tweaked to work optimally.
---
Sure getting kill rushed is annoying but your opponent is trying to have fun as well, and their goals are completely at odds with yours. As a survivor you're probably trying to complete the generator you're working on as fast as possible, instead of 99%'ing each one out of concern that the match is going too fast for your opponent or something, right? Killers often want to eliminate their "gens" as fast as possible as well. If your match only lasts five minutes it doesn't really matter how you were rushed out of it IMO, maybe you have a preference but either way it's just each side doing their objective so IMO the complaints should be directed at BHVR and not each other.
---
Last Breath: Use Active Ability to swing at a survivor,

if they are injured they must make 1/2/3 skill checks to breathe manually, if they miss a skill check they receive a 3% Hindered effect. Cool down is 120 seconds.

"Wh-what are you going to do with that g-giant club, Oni-chan?"

I play more survivor than I do killer, I am a better rank on survivor also. Legions can be annoying, but no more than any other. I have seen my favourite killer be nerfed and nerfed again and now an opportunity has come up for me and all the old legion mains to enjoy him again and all survivors want to do is nerf him more. He isn‚Äôt strong and this situational perk will only be effective once maybe twice a game if the survivors are good, why is that still to much to let us have?
---
Jane = *thicc*
---
Nah, he's way too ugly
---
The only thing that bothers me so far is his extreme mobility with demon dash. I had a game on the Saw map where he downed me downstairs, went upstairs and downed two more survivors across the map from eachother under one powerup.

Other than that I like going against him lol.
