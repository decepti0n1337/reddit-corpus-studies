can tombstone mier’s not check lockers or what?

---
best one in the series IMO
---
You could say camping is an exploit. You'd be wrong, but you could say that.
---
He thinks Spine Chill is better than DS and Dead Hard. Nothing against the dude but ... Seriously ? I don't .. I just don't understand....
---
They said they can see people who are abusing exploits. So im pretty sure they know about Wake Up too and will ban people for it.
---
Somebody’s never been on Lery’s and had tier 1 meyers turn a corner on you
---
Ghostface is on on both consoles now
---
You're right, It's a legit strategy.
---
Thank God
---
All the killers have The infront of their names. The Ghost seems the most fitting to me.
---
Welcome to the toxic community
---
I feel like I’ve definitely seen this art before. Not to be that one asshole who’s always dubious, its more I feel like I’ve definitely seen that before somewhere else.
---

---
Either way, awesome work OP(‘s wife/not wife)
---
Lol I love seeing all the entitled survivors in the comments downvoting op,  If survivors can choose what killers they dc then killers should be able to choose what survivors they can dc
---
I think I'm missing out on context because I would think people would be piss being forced to save people that killed a love one.
---
Idk if they'd like that ... I know I love that when playing as Ghostface 11/10 !
---
Does he use a balloon knife???
---
Still better then noob3
---
&gt; Thanatophobia is broken to do nothing but show the bar as red but that’s not actually an exploit, it’s a negative impact on the killer actually
---
Nothing is changed about Thanatophobia, then.
---
So true! Everyone could benefit from a different perspective and more positivity. It’s such a fun game, let’s not bring it down with hate. The more people playing and having fun, the longer we can all enjoy it.
---
Tldr: Legions bad, fix add ons
---
Its pretty much just for the daily when u dont have any others
---
The only non meta he plays as survivor is the jacket Golden Blur.. he runs those same meta perks unless he's doing a series like the no mither to rank 1, so he's being a bit silly if he's saying their too strong since he usually runs the. I do like his stuff though i wish he'd make less excuses and actually call out good plays from the other team more.
---
As a Doctor main I could tell you that the funniest way to play him for me atleast is to run perks which grants you a larger terror radius and more bloodpoints. Keeping survivors in Madness 3 will prevent them from performing actions and it will buy you time to spend chasing others. 
---
The Doctor is also excelent as farming Bloodpoints. In any game where I have hooked survivors a total of four times without getting any kills, I still often earn atleast 18-20k Bloodpoints before modifiers. Knowing this I always run him for bloodpoint events. I will get tons and I can on purpose choose to not kill any of the survivors either, granting them a pretty good ammount aswell.
---
Gen Jockeying...you don't have time to unhook other players
---
I actually do play in Red ranks, and do it consistently with many different builds, yeah ruin is useful as hell but it doesnt change the fact the game is balanced right now - perks like dicisive strike or borrowed time are useless if you dont tunnel - i have played over 800 hours and could easily say that is the best time for the game ever for killers - no bullshit perks, no op strats - if you got trouble defending gens try discordance and pop goes the weasel
---
I get snags all the time as Michael in tier 1 that's almost always my first hook but that's with M&amp;A
---
&gt;I can report anyone using them for exploiting
---
Since you don't have to report them, there isn't much point in letting everybody know which perks are bugged right now. It will only allow more people to learn about them. 
---
[Devs know about Wake Up and know who's abusing it.](https://redd.it/c3nrrl)
---
I like his stuff, but he does make excuses a lot, he'd be far more watchable if he just admitted the survivors are playing well a lot more often than complaining.
---
He's 61 years old? Didn't realize that :/
---
Good idea actually. I’ll try that.
---
I used it...
---
Username checks out
---
Been having a lot of new players, when i play huntress i get matched against baby survivors. Tried billy and got a rank 3 survivor (i was rank 15 killer) Like wtf
---
He absolutely does need a nerf. He's pig + myers combined except he can farm his ability on specific players and it doesn't have a cooldown.
---
The DLC killers on this game are ridiculous.
---
"except I get unlucky" That's why people don't like UE. It's similar in concept to poker, you can be an aggressive player that takes control of situations or you can be a passive person that relies on a factor that you can't control or ever become more skillful at, luck.
---
Get somma dat Ash

We should be getting an automatic cake every 2 levels imo.

[removed]
---
Dude, calm down, you even don't know about what you talking about.
---
"Bullied by SWF teams"
---
That team had 1 key, 1 purple flashlight and an instant heal and all the meta perks . They were ranks 2, 4, 5 and 12. I think it's pretty clear that was a SWF team, probably even a 4 man. 
---
"I'm a killer main and wonder why he insist on using Enduring and Spirit Fury on every killer and then moans about any perks survivors have".
---
I hope you really don't think EndFury is OP, because if you think so, you are just bad. You need 2 perks slots for something that might activate 2-3 times in a match and survivors can still counter your combo by dropping pallets earlier. And when he ask for nerfs on survivors perks ? Please show me where he said "guys, new DS still is too OP" or "I think BT needs a nerf", because I never saw him "moans" about these perks. And even if he would so, survivors mains complains a lot about NOED, BBQ, Ruin, ...
---
"he's still moaning about how he outplays people and they won because they were toxic."
---
He never said they won because they were toxic, he said he won because of how fast gens were done. Plus, they tea bagging him and one of them even abused the bugged Wake Up in his match. Is that not toxic for you ?
---
I saw that match and I can say that gens were done pretty fast, I even didn't notice when the first 3 gens were done ( in my head it was : "that team messed a lot, how can they finish gens so fast" ). I don't know how many mistakes Tru3 did ( he made a big one at the end, he could get 2 kills tho ). They weren't even good survivors, they were carried by their voice comms and their exploits, Tru3 got salty after playing Ghost Face on Coldwind Farm against a team who literally negated his power ( Ghost Face is very weak against SWF teams btw ), he literally played a M1 killer, he probably couldn't done much better than that and even if he could, it wouldn't matter because they had instant heals and keys and exploits and they very probably would've still escaped. The only thing he could done better in that match it was to play Nurse, Spirit or Billy.
---
If you don't want to watch Tru3, don't watch it, but don't lie on forums about him moaning about survivor perks ( or show me where did he say about a survivor perk that needs nerf if you can )  and don't say shit like "Endfury OP".
---
Get revealed
---
Self care has to be one of the most over rated perks ever,there is just so many better alternatives
---
I forgot about the the so yeah The ghost does sound the best
---
I always assumed “walking” leaves behind scratch marks and that crouching was the only way to go all “stealth” without leaving behind ANY marks. 
---
Turns out I was wrong. Goodbye, UE.
---
Scott is really good to watch because he explains why things are so strong, i.e certain maps vs certain killers, certain features like the main building on grim pantry, and he clearly calls out when survivors play well or when he makes a mistake. Then he gets back to playing. Also he's a cat person so +1
---
I played wraith and followed someone into a shack and they juked me and hid in a closet. There were two of them. One was on the left side. The other was on the right side. I kept looking at both of them and shaking my head up and down and chose the wrong one but he was wasn't very wise when it came to loosing me so i caught him.
---
Its kinda dumb they have to ban people instead of you know, fixing it.
---
I have posted some of her art on here before. Or you couldve seen it on her twitter, tumblr
---
Jesus hop off his cock bro
---
Corrupt Intervention/Ruin, Haunted Grounds/Whispers, Make Your Choice, BBQ&amp;Chili.  
---
Both one-shot perks are amazing on Hag; I'd never give them up.  
---
BBQ&amp;Chili is for bloodpoints.  
---
Corrupt Intervention or Ruin is usually necessary for Hag, as she's a 110% ms killer.
---
I find it funny the most useful part of this perk is a bug...
---
GhostFace doesn't sound bad either.
---
I wish he had a better power , 
---
What if he was sprinting and wasn't in a chase his power gauge didn't deplete as fast giving him more map pressure.
---
to camp the hooks?
---
Yeah
---
Fair to assume this was done via the mobile messaging app. Considering navigating the sometimes clunky PS4 dashboard would require blind luck and amazing timing.
---
What also is amazing is how early in the mori this clearly is. As such, if he was using the app, and accounting both the delay created by how long messages take to be delivered with that thing and the time to type.
---
This guy literally had your psn profile readily found and his message pretyped, ready for you to mori him.
---
What fucking dedication.
---
I see your point, but I never **ever** want to return to the dark ages of 3 man games.
---
Ruin, play with your food, sloppy butcher, bamboozle
---
I’m new to the game and I’ve played about half the starter killers and I’ve done the best with Phantom
---
I think it would be cool if Overcharge had tons of electricity effects around it instead of regular sparks
---
This is easily the best post on this subreddit
---
&gt;Honestly I don't think I'll ever get the fast pace killer I loved back. I loved Legion because of their fast top speed game-play.
---
I'm sorry to say that the Legion you loved was the Legion that was bad for the game. It's pretty clear you favor old Legion to the current one, which was a 0 counterplay nightmare that made balancing the killer impossible. The rework was necessary, long overdue, and better for the rest of the game. 
---
I agree there needs to be more reward for good play with Legion. But to say this rework was lazy is asinine, especially considering where you stand on old Legion vs the new one.
---
hag is like f tier bro
---
_10 traps remaining_
---
I rarely ever see clown
---
It’s quite tough sometimes, especially on certain maps and with proficient GFs, but you want to make sure he stays in the center of your screen. You have to be within a certain distance as well, which can be reduced by the killer with add-ons. It takes 1.5 seconds of continuous line of sight, so if GF crouches or gets behind a wall, it resets.
---
I will say if you are hooked or downed, do your best to maintain view of him as you can still detect him out of stealth and save your friends from getting stalked.
---
It's good for if you wanna ignore having to hook someone lol
---
They always come back.
---
So they all protect the other survivor? Sounds interesting to play against.
---
I think Legion's power will always remain trashy. Just buffing it makes it seem stupid and broken. It needs a total redo.
---
Brutal Strength does next to nothing and Bamboozle is even more situational than EndFury because it's or unnecessary or useless depending on the map. On very few maps Bamboozle actually has value, IMO.
---
6 minutes
---
Yesss. It was on Discord if I recall. On Demi’s server, most likely. Else it could be one DBD community I’ve joined. (I haven’t been on this subreddit for long, so its unlikely I saw it here.) Even if it wasn’t her posting it, generally appropriate credit is given and I recall that being the case. 
---
Or I could be blustering and I saw some other random chibi art and I’m making all this shit up. Either way her work is amazing, man. Kudos. 👍👍👍
---
Yeah like he'll always complain about mettle and ds but then what does he use in all of his recent surv videos? Mettle and ds.
---
I don’t see this as a horror game, it’s more of a thriller with horror elements.
---
You made this exact same post the day he was released
---
If you have Doc perks, M&amp;A is quite fun on her due to her low body profile. A good M&amp;A Hag On Lerys or Game is especially terrifying.
---
[Right back at ya, bud!](https://imgur.com/a/eRHfS0N)
---
What a wholesome post. I love it. :D No matter how much the two sides get on each others nerves, we do need each other. &lt;3
---
Really? I wasn’t trying to be like No0b3 lmao
---
I can completely understand that; I've only viewed this game as a horror game for the first 20 hours I played.
---
Maybe the idea is that overcharge is hidden, I don’t really know. That would be really cool though, maybe other perks like ruin and surveillance have their own effects!
---
They could have fixed his issues without destroying what was fun about the killer. Why make them so slow? Why make them DS themselves every single time they use their power? Why make every add on not called iridescent button worthless? Why cancel their power on missed hits instead of removing 3 or 4 seconds from it? Why only let them use their bad power when it's full? These are just a few of the overkill nerfs.
---
I agree, some blue or yellow sparks to show Overcharge would be sweet. I feel like I’ve seen OC killers kick gens up close, and I really want to say there is a VFX upon kicking, but it’s not persistent. Don’t quote me on that though.
---
She has a short speed burst upon reappearing, lunging during this boost will increase lunge speed, and thus distance. The Wakizashi add on and equivelants extend this duration, allowing for even speedier lunges on reappearance.
---
Yeah it's not instant, that is for sure, and any of the range add-ons slow it down. That's why I recommended the brown one, get extea range but it barely slows it down much at all. With his shock, you're really just predicting their course of action, aiming ahead of them. Make the wrong read, and yeah, it can cost you some precious time. Wish I had better tips
---
He already use BBQ and Ruin IMO. Thrilling Tremors is weak in my opinion, I wouldn't run that perk out side of a Prayer Beads Spirit build. Infectious Fright is only good on Nurse and Myers, on other killers it's really mediocre and he doesn't like to slug. They nerfed Spies From The Shadows after buffing it and it's again a useless perk.
---
I dont think it will ever rain shirtless myers that would be crazy
---
Do both.
---
well, still does not change the fact i found the video very boring.
---
maybe keep them short.
---
This is why I sometimes entertain the thought of DBD having proxi, cross-team voicechat. Just so that survivor team could hear you blubbering ass waxing about being ‘a shadowed blade in the night’ and having a slurred speech about just how fucking sneaky you are. 
---
Drunk DBD sounds fun as shit, I need to try that sometime, thanks OP.

Its a certain amount of seconds after you hook someone and if another survivor is nearby you're not supposed to lose points. Idk the exact amount of points but you can check after a match my hovering your mouse over the emblem
---
Yeah but that “dark hunger” that stirred inside her was the Entity fucking her up. When she was Lisa, she did nothing wrong. 
---
Before Rin’s story, the Hag’s really fucked me up, because her torture and departure into the Entity’s realm was so senseless, so cruel.
---
The only time I ever hear about tru3 is when he's commenting about balance lol
---
I liked the speed of legion which was mentioned several times in my post. I agree he was bad for the game but It wasn’t the downing with the power, or the starting it when the gauge was half full that I miss. It was the speed I miss. Nothing I’m this game compares to how fast I felt playing old legion. It’s insulting to me that yours assume my stance on old legion. As I was one of the people actively coming up with rework ideas and making posts and comments on the legion. Explaining that although I found the legions speed enjoyable, I found it too easy to chase. I’ve talked multiple times about how it felt like I’d win no matter what. The legions rework was necessary. I was always on of the people asking for it. But it was lazily done. And the unusable add-ons reflect that.
---
Nice job! 
---
I’ve pretty much given up on Adepts since the double-pip condition was added since I’m a lousy killer. Kudos!
---
Pro tip: best way to use a firecracker is when the Killer has someone else on their shoulder. Take a hit and drop the firecracker immediately. The Killer won't be able to look away during their brief stun animation and they'll yeet your teammate off their shoulder.
---
Survivors do not like the Ghostface teabag at all.
---
Have hook blocking always been broken? I had 2 survivors left, carrying one to the hook. The other survivor crouched down and broke my killer. I was sliding to the side for a solid 6-8 seconds, completely losing control of my character. Couldn't move nor attack.
---
Ya lost me at discord honestly. But wouldn't be surprised if people shared her stuff. I wont her more out there anyway. Like bhvr retweeting her stuff out there
---
WHO IS THIS CHICK?!?!? I see her all over the internet...SO HOT!
---
I honestly haven't played since blood hunt ended. I'm wondering if this is the most bug filled patch yet
---
If they could just fix it theres no reason to ban
---
Far play, mate. Thats a good way of thinking about it.
---
Remember the three windows in the Wretched Shop?
---
I don't agree with you but I respect your opinion :)
---
Dead meat reference = upvote
---
I did message him in the pregame lobby saying "You got it". So I'm sure he knew it was coming lol
---
Oh where’s that “Wait, that’s illegal.” Meme when you need it
---
Just like you :D
---
They're losers who feels big if they smash a win.
---
Ghostface is looking right at BBQ like: you seeing this shit?
---
Asymmetrical games must be hell to balance. I can't blame them too much.

If the wraith wants some love first he have to be viable

I object for clown doctor and trapper

Holy shit those downvotes
---
This is what happens when you try and use a GPS to escape the trial
---
Overcharge and surveillance don't have any special effects because like you guessed they are a surprise.
---
It’s the trade off
---
People are exploiting bugs to gain an unfair advantage. They deserve a ban.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse, Ruin, Haunted Grounds and Bamboozle. Or switch out Ruin with Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
I’ve found using the audio cue can help me find the ‘sweet spot’ to hold to expose him.
---
I'm waiting in a lobby trying to do the exact same thing
---
I use to watch him a lot, there was a video where he kept leaving the obsession on the floor while playing spirit then crying that he couldn’t pick up the obsession because they had decisive and he’d lose all pressure if he got stunned but then they kept healing the obsession and he’d chase after them and down them again but still wouldn’t pick them up. At the end of the match, he chased and dropped the obsession 5 times without picking them up then continued to cry the whole match about not being able to because he’d lose pressure.
---
I’m sitting here like dude you wasted a total of possibly 3 mins chasing when you could’ve just ate the stun the first time since you had enduring and continued like nothing.
---
He started off fun to watch but every video just turned into him crying about something and when he’d cry about decisive it was just annoying. All he ever does is cry about everything now.
---
Damn. I think BHVR should certainly take pride in this, even the most powerful killers at the highest tiers aren’t outweighed when it comes to the amount of people playing them. This is either a testament to the fact this game still gets more attention poured into its balance than most other games. (Yes, its true. The devs sometimes make good balancing decisions) or this communities passion for variety and love for the current killers.
---
Awesome. SurprisinglyWholesome/10
---
Way
---
You get 250 Survival for being marked by Ghostface and then not being downed until the mark expires.
---
Just a random FYI.
---
I'm rank 8 survivor and I can't get matches. At all on PC. Ever. I've tried everything. Killer and survivor. Are the servers bugged or something? They're making the game unplayable.
---
Not the first time I’ve seen the t-posing shadow 😬
---
Ur pp hard don't lie
---
Very well, I third this post.
---
Thank you for informing me I hadn't noticed that
---
&gt;I liked the speed of legion which was mentioned several times in my post. I agree he was bad for the game but It wasn’t the downing with the power, or the starting it when the gauge was half full that I miss. It was the speed I miss.
---
That speed contributed to his 0 counterplay. That's what made him a balancing problem
---
Imagine thinking that DS is still meta in 2019
---
If I played killer slot then hell yea it would be
---
This is buffing his add-ons
---
Exactly. He will explain why a map is going to suck for him, and it all makes sense.  I once saw a game where Tru3 said a map was going to be bad for him when he was playing Huntress (on Lerys), but by the end of the match that was completely thrown out the window and he was complaining that he lost because of genrush SWF. Of course, the minute and a half he took before finding a survivor after getting his first hook had absolutely nothing to do with it lol. Scott will also talk about how certain OP addons  like Prayer Beads are stupid. He’s just comes off so much better than those guys. Very, very unbiased guy.
---
This pmuch. I will literally never play survivor because it doesn't interest me.
---
Ruin, Bamboozle &amp; Thrilling Tremors are all tier 2.
---
KYF automatically makes all perks tier 3.
---
Nice try at being a smart ass.
---
It was merely accidental, he was just trying to get a better look at Kate. 
---
;)
---
They won't ban people for this unless they make an official announcement on it.
---
I've not had an issue so far so maybe you're not doing it right?
---
When he's leaning you NEED to move to reveal him because not enough of his body is showing.
---
When he's crouching the top of his head is the reveal zone and should be in the centre of the screen.
---
If he crouch or lean techs you around or above/velow objects, you won't reveal him.
---
So they strapped away it entirely. Making him painfully slow. Left no add-ons that allowed for him to increase his speed whatsoever. Read the post fully next time. I’m asking for speed add-ons not an increase in his ability.
---
It hard 🔫🔫🔫🔫
---
He made mistakes in that match. But survivors also played horribly, they made even more mistakes than Tru3 and yet their comms, perks and exploits carried them.
---
You just defended a SWF
---
It just felt so on the nose I didn't know how to feel. I didn't actually play dbd last night (I usually do in the evenings) but I did hear Fred's lullaby in a video? I'm just amazed it managed to become a microsleep dream.

---
Sometimes he'll start to chase me and then just stand still in the open,so I'll turn my camera behind me or even stop and turn around my character to look at him in the open and I'll just go exposed?
---
&gt;Why make them so slow?
---
Bc when they had high speed they had no counterplay. Speed is a sensitive stat to play with and high speed can often be a big issue. 
---
&gt;Why make them DS themselves every single time they use their power?
---
Bc if not then it's just a better Spirit power. 
---
&gt;Why make every add on not called iridescent button worthless?
---
Bc BHVR can't adjust things with Legions frenzy as far as speed goes. I agree the add ons need reworked but saying old Legion needs to make a re-debut is stupid. 
---
&gt;Why cancel their power on missed hits instead of removing 3 or 4 seconds from it?
---
Why does Nurse get fatigue stunned for missing a Survivior with her blink? Bc then there's counterplay. Taking time off the power does nothing, it makes it no counter play still. 
---
&gt;Why only let them use their bad power when it's full?
---
When Spirit can do it without the power bar being full then we can talk about it for Legion. 
---
&gt;These are just a few of the overkill nerfs.
---
No they aren't. They were aimed at giving legion counterplay and were successful
---
When youre doing adept Quentin and get banned
---
Do you want every endgame to be the exact same every time?
---
I don't. The rare tension of Rancor, or any similar perk for that matter, is a very welcome change of pace.
---
They already made a statement about it. So yes.
---
Speed is a sensitive stat to adjust. The reason Legion was such a pariah among Surviviors was bc his speed gave Surviviors no way to truly escape against him in Frenzy. Making frenzy just a free hit button for Legion, which was unfair. 
---
I agree the add ons need changed, but to argue speed needs to come back to Legion is just demonstrably not a good idea.
---
I will Facecamp every ash I see because of this post
---
Well I wanted him to be called "The Mask"
---
What exploits? And how do you know they were on coms ffs. Your just guessing
---
It hasn't convinced me of anything, stop reading stuff between lines that isn't there. Reddit's always been shitty and your garbage meme is part of the worst of it.
---
I use it as a psychological factor. Any kill I got from it is just a bonus
---
What if they did all or nothing sacrifice points? And you would only get sacrifice points if you sacrifice the survivor completely? I mean if they escape before their death hook then you didn’t even kill them. All or nothing. Would give a reason for killers not to farm. 
---
The killers would riot. Admit it. This is exactly what you do to survivors.

Yes it is. I'd remove it for the time being, I've made the same precaution. :(

Or try the official dead by daylight discord server if your looking for some friends to play with
---
What a shit take this is
---
Wow, he and I share birthdays.
---
Because he brought a mori? Jesus the reasons to whine never end with you guys.
---
He didn't know ahead of time you were burning those things, there's no real reason anyone should as they don't expire. So he gets into a match with an ultra rare offering, and now bonus points for using it so you cry and DC and say he should completely waste it and let you win? Ok.
---
Could you send me the discord???
---
Ghostface would live if he took notes from the past.
---
Exploiting is cheating in my book.
---
I don't think that is how you use that meme.
---
A shame that all the stealth killers end up this way.
---
Use the perk wake up. Thank me later ;)
---
&gt;After insta downing them
---
Oh, wow, sorry. Let us just never use our killer powers now, I didn't realise you hadn't sanctioned their use.
---
I'm pretty sure it's discord.gg/deadbydaylight
---
Let me know if that works I'm not sure what their public invite link is
---
it has the hots for her
---
Thank you. It's part of my Quentin build and I used it for almost half a day before realising something was wrong. I did notice things were faster but I didn't know why. Took it off after news spread. Despite it being online there would be some people who still don't know and I think it's unfair people assume everyone will be exploiting though I'm sure the majority still are.
---
It's not exactly common for people to use Quentin's base perks after all, lol...
---
That's a shame because DBD is more of a party game than a competitive game.  You can't have perfect true balance for it without alienating the casual playerbase (who play for fun and don't care so much about getting perfect games and winning), which makes up the majority of the people.
---
I second what that guy said plus you have to keep in mind you need 4 survivors to 1 killer so it's a longer que regardless.
---
Just run. Whether the game lets you reveal him or not seems to be random chance so I just start running now.
---
Thank you so much it worked 😀
---
I play killer and I want to die
---
Good luck
---
4 stacks of furtive, M&amp;A, paint brush. Even with M&amp;A, you still get an 8 meter reduction during a chase. since paint brush decreases by 16 meters, 8 meter decrease is all you need to have no terror radius at all (24 - 16 - 8 = 0)
---
Oh, I don't care about escaping.  That's not the point.  The point is he didn't allow anyone to farm points; including himself.  
---
You can see the type of people who think this shit is "just fine" in this subreddit.  u/branflakesyt is a prime example of that toxicity which permeates this community. 
---
And yet there are some shining examples of killers out there who recognize what was used and use it to everyone's advantage.  I had that in several games this week - killers just wanting to farm and get points, and survivors doing the same in kind. 
---
But sure, let's defend a broken killer with hex ruin who doesn't let anyone, including himself, get blood points.
---
I honestly didnt see any problem with old legion besides the metric fuck ton of bugs and exploits and Franks mixtape
---
Hey, It seems you're having a bad day so I bought you this silver reward. I hope this helps to make you're day better and see that not all of reddit is bad
---
Thanks
---
chucky?
---
Stop. Just fucki s.t.o.p.
---
Chucky won't fit this game for obvious reasons.
---
Stop making stupid discussions about him. Enough.
---
Object of Obsession
---
I agree, they should go the fortnite approach and give a message saying its temporary disabled until we fix it.
---
Thanks for explaining it in detail, I was worried as I did use it for some time before it was a known bug and it's part of my usual Quen build.
---
If they fixed it as fast as they shouldv then theres no reason to ban
---
All ears is killer on nurse (And to a lesser extent huntress)
---
Couldnt even stand 1 minute
---
I really think he just doesn't enjoy dbd anymore. I think that's the real problem. Maybe he's scared ro leave and lose his entire fanbase, idk, but its definitely not healthy where he is right now. I love the guy, but I'm just stating it how I see it.
---
Because killers dont dodge any lobby they dont like?
---
Yup. rip killer mains until the patch
---
I’m guilty of this,
---
I want to feel like the killer has earned his hook, that we where both on a level playing field, but Hillbilly, if I make ONE mistake if I’m out of position even ONCE I’m gonna get insta downed, the saw has a ridiculous hitbox and is beyond easy to land there’s next to no skill required in landing it, I play both sides and I just honestly feel like I’m cheating when I play him, as of a few months ago I refused to play him, 
---
The second I hear that saw, and it’s not Bubba I’m gone.
---
It was impossible to get away from him. It’s good they fixed him. It’s just not good that they put 0 effort into it.
---
Amanda shouldnt be in that tier because she already got shot and died mate
---
He runs that setup on every killer he plays and I don't get it.
---
It's not as simple as u make it sound
---
the speed was an issue only because you could use frenzy when you wanted to, and could down people with frenzy. Faster speed now wouldn’t be 0 counterplay as you still have a 4 second stun after using frenzy, can’t down with frenzy, and can’t use frenzy whenever you want. 
---
The issue of speed being 0 counterplay was because of Legions old state. Faster speed just helps make him feel more fluid.
---
He runs them because they work, like everyone else. If anything it proves his point.
---
2 minutes and 30 seconds. It's only a 2 minute timer if you're running the tampered timer.
---
Myers: My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
---
In every single one of the scream movies ghost face survives being shot or fatally wounded in some sense as least one time
---
I think he could go up a tier tbh
---
Come play survivor with me &lt;3
---
Work on gens until first down, then find that player and unhook them as quickly as possible. With borrowed time, if the killer is in the area, it guarantees a safe hook rescue.
---
Im pretty sure the reason why is in her character description. Something about losing faith in god and the entity reaching out to her.
---
i'm not sure if this is sarcasm, but you can absolutely learn how maps generate gates. you can learn how maps generate...any tile? like...you're joking, right?
---
Absolutely, been having the same thoughts. He’s a good killer, no doubt, but his true talent is somehow being able to stroke his ego and whine at the same time.
---
....you know what a 12 year old dick looks like?
---
This happened to me but with a Bill.
---
Care to elaborate for us on how chucky is a bad character and not just tacky ways of spelling words?
---
Every time you prestige you lose all Perks, Add ons, and Offerings but get 1/3rd of the Bloody Set and it slightly increases the chances of rarer stuff appearing on the bloodweb
---
I agree totally. While Friday is still a fun game with no more content it sorta is on its last legs. While dbd is being very successful.
---
I hit 131/131 a few days ago, feels good. Congrats on your achievements bro :)
---
Honestly, once you have the achievement for it, it’s not worth it.
---
I guess it happens every time you hook a survivor, you just have to be looking in the right direction
---
There’s supposedly a higher chance of better items. I’ve noticed I already have more higher rarity items on my P3 level 50 feng than my non prestiged Claudette that I mained for the longest time
---
r/Prequelmemes i guess
---
Absolutely, I also pet him everytime I play hag
---
Feels like Ghostface is the new Killer for assholes.
---
Pretty much lost interest when he tried saying clown was the worst killer while running absolutely horrible addons+perks. You cant slap crap on a med tier  killer and expect to perform well like nurse, billy and spirit
---
The mom wouldn’t make sense. And I’ll just defuse the Roy thing because Roy can be given a pass. While it would be weird for the mother to hear her own voices telllijg her what to do and calling her Jason
---
Just let the locket have its wig.
---
He was ghostface yet no tbagging or head nodding, maybe, just maybe, the new EDC is entertaining to people and they want to see it?
---
I think Ghostfaces perks are a good example. Mediocre perks with exorbitantly long cooldowns for no reason. I'm All Ears is definitely better now than it was, and Tremors might be decent if not for the aforementioned exorbitantly long cooldown, but I don't even know what Furtive Chase was supposed to be. The reason why Monitor and Abuse is a good perk is because it allows you to get close to survivors without them knowing it. The fact that Furtive Chase only works while in a chase takes away any reason to run it, even though the obsession mechanics it has could have made for a really interesting perk if just had some different different effect.

---
How in the world did that happen?
---
I hit her while she was coming out of locker and landed up there somehow lol.
---
I do find playing Legion successfully to be possible even without higher tier addons like i do with Wraith. Some of the changes were a huge step in the right direction, namely how 115% movement made them more than viable at the stab and chase gameplay. What needs touching are addons to maybe make em more unpredictable and deadly rather than buffing/tweaking every stat in their power in some way (other than speed).
---
This has ruined so many close achievements
---
Her brother seems keen c:
---
Great tip!
---
Nope. I'm on PC. The "glide" they triggered isn't a movement you can make. It was like I was floating.
---
Simple. Jason can sense survivors. Like Michael with scratched mirror.
---
Well, maybe because he is a fucking doll? I'm pretty sure you and other Chucky fanboys want Chucky in doll form, rather in his original human one. If you want a killer that isn't able too see anything because of his size, who would force devs to make very special animations for him (it's kinda expensive) and who can literally be kicked ij the face and locked somewhere, then you'd better never suggest anything
---
I've seen multiple people talk about the pwyf bug.
---
To op
---
Except for the fact you can waste 5 mins trying to get into a game because killers keep dodging lobbies.
---
At that period where survivors had long queue times it was extremely bad. 12-20 mins just to get into a game. 5 mins queing just for the killer to dodge.
---
Ey, bettsr delete this blasphemous shit real quick hun, not funny &gt;:( ^^^bing ^^^bong
---
Doubt it. Devs said people speed hacking back when you could edit 1 line in your CFG file  would be punished my friend was on multiple streams that clipped him cheating and reporting him in the clip. He was never punished. Devs just say whatever will shut people up.
---
Oh so I should burn all cakes and puddings before prestige?
---
Well more than just add-ons will be changed. Like Legion needs to be something completely different power-wise
---
Shit man, that looks tight as hell. Wish I had bought Surveillance when it was available couple of weeks ago. I feel like an idiot.  
---
How is the build holding up?
---
Not only distressing gives 100% but it’s very easy to max out all four bp scoring sections as doc
---
If a survivor is wasting that much of your time, it’s best to just leave them and focus on gens. Bamboozle could be pretty strong in Ghostface if you’re having a hard time being looped around large structures. Most of the time I just leave them alone if they managed to evade me for over 20 seconds without dropping a pallet or getting hit.
---
Chances are it's a bugged lobby that you need to just exit out of and retry.  It seems to happen off and on.
---
They could also easily make a system where it doesn't break your premade group everytime you queue. Just because it's easy doesn't mean the devs are going to do it. If I'm not mistaken Mordhau has a team that is miniscule to BHVR and somehow  there prelobby shit works just fine as well as most other games. People give Devs way too much credit.
---
But if Killers were buffed it'd just lead to even longer wait times since more people would play Killers.  :thinking:
---
It’s manipulation via the Entity. It’s tricked her into killing and made her think that in return, the bloodshed or “sacrifice” will help cure her and her people from where she is from. It’s in her Bio. She has one of the saddest backstories in the game.
---
Props to you. I pretty much gave up on adept achievements after the updates to it
---
&gt;*ghostface* *HHHHHHHHHHH* "fineeee."
---
FTFY
---
I use unrelenting because thats the most viable 4th perk I have for her. She still only level 19 so I don't have much to choose from and thana is still tier 1.
---
You could say the same thing about Lithe. It's just an idea on a new 150% Haste perk since we haven't seen one since Chapter IV and honestly Poised is just kinda weak on it's own.
---
Lol by letting him get to the very edge, picking him up and dropping him close to the gate again. If you really want to see the entity you don’t need to do that.
---
Happened to me a few games ago. They cant get down. Let em bleeeeed.
---
Awwww man! I feel your pain!
---
Boi if someone is running two exhaustion perks then they're wasting a perk slot lol
---
I was playing earlier and I’m a level 15 and got 2 red ranks and a green
---
Yea all I remember watching was me thinking when was he gonna show up or I’d forget it was about ghost face.
---
Stalky boi in the back looks ready to go.
---
Ironically enough a nurse just solely went for me and got me lmao did not fuck off 🤣🤣🤣 and then she left the game one of you fucks from the thread come and get me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Yes
---
and yea
---
It's been tested and it doesnt do anything.
---
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!?!?!
---
I just use it when I have a daily
---
Lithe/sprint burst, dead hard, adrenaline. An actual meta perk build. Also billy is one of the most balanced killers in ability alone. That chainsaw is hard to steer
---
why doesn't this make any sense to me
---
5/4/3 generators remaining + n survivors alive(n&gt;1) - hatch will not spawn.  
---
2 generators remaining + 2(or less) survivors - hatch spawns.  
---
1 generator remaining + 3(or less) survivors - hatch spawns.  
---
0 generators remaining + 4(or less) survivors - hatch spawns.  
---
One survivor alive is a special case - the hatch always opens
---
Awesome. I played early access and I found it really fun. Just wanted to make sure.
---
I agree, for this reason lithe is kind of underwelming.
---
*confused streaming\**
---
\- FTFY
---
You need to COMPLETE one more generator than people alive. For example, if there are 3 people alive, you need to complete 4 gens, meaning only 1 more gen needs completed
---
Tbh surprisingly steering the chainsaw is actually one of the only things I'm decent at controlling when it comes playing on console lol
---
Only 1 blink btw
---
Yup. This just killed me.
---
Why would anybody want op perks? Bad for the game.
---
I feel like trapper should be top tier, his perks and lore call him an unstoppable monster
---
Ofc hes a good boi
---
Its considerably better now, I have never had to wait more than 2 minutes to find a lobby, swf or not. But that's as survivors. Killers have a high queue time RN because of the event that gives these offerings for more BPs and it's just easier to farm BP's on killer
---
Please no.
---
If this is supposed to be sarcasm, you might wanna add one of these:
---
/s
---
It'll help avoid any misunderstandings in the future.🤙🤙
---
I guess I'm the unpopular opinion here but I love playing Legion even in their current state, and play them about 90% of the time (I'm rank 5 at the moment). It no longer feels "cheap" to play them, you can still apply pressure to multiple survivors at once (by inflicting them all with frenzy). Tagging as many survivors as possible keeps them off generators while you finish chase with someone. Even if it doesn't take long to mend, it's still a few precious seconds that they're off generators. 
---
The only change I'd like to see is them making the frenzy stun shorter - 4 seconds feels like an eternity when you're pressed for time. Otherwise, I enjoy playing them. I run Save the Best for Last (a game changer on Legion IMO), Sloppy Butcher, Ruin and BBQ.
---
All the killer has to do for their stacks of BBQ is hook people, which is their objective. Personally, I think it would be fair.
---
&gt;Survivors saving means you are in SWF. 
---
&gt;Survivors using good items means you are in SWF.
---
Yeah, no. I'm an altruistic survivor (unless they're obviously camping). And I use good items like instaheals and purple flashlights, but I play maybe 3 or 4 SWF games a week, the rest is solo.
---
Maybe they were just good survivors, and he's trying to make excuses for why he lost.
---
Entity said it's my turn on the Xbox
---
It would be fun to make jokes and shit
---
I'll get plague!
---
That's not how the world works sadly. It'll be free on mobile sometime this year.
---
Mad lad congrats
---
At 17, get Ghost Face.
---
Myers is super fun, but leatherface is great for the perk BBQ which helps boost bloodpoints a ton.

---
What if he could switch from human to doll form and the only way for him to carry a survivor is to change back to human form
---
Hoestly Ive read his ability  land seen some gameplay, can you explain why he is good
---
Well thank you for letting me try my best to get your ass on a hook.
---
Dont go to reddit for this keep it to yourself
---
Not really, especially since I took a look at that post and more of the people are saying DBD is better by default.
---
They were very smart about it, they would approach local businesses with the project as an investment opportunity and sold them shares of the rights to the film. They personally made very little money off of it, and had to untangle who owned what while making the sequels, but it launched both of their careers.
---
Odd, in hundreds of hours in dbd I’ve only ever come across this twice and last time was several months back
---
Holy shit what a username 😂
---
You can hook my ass any day xo
---
I'm trying to be kind of "realistic"
---
A YouTuber tested this and Brand New Part actually made you repair the gen slower than if you were just using an engineers tool box with speed add ons. He was trying to get a less than 10 sec gen repair. I believe the brand new part, plus wake up, plus left behind, plus resilience and spine chill was like 12.59 secs and a green box with speed add ons was 10 secs flat with the same set up. 
---
Brand New Part is garbo now.
---
*Humble oinks*
---
I shit myself just looking at him
---
I tend to let Ash’s live every time I see them just because I love the show/movie. And if it’s a whole group of them I’ll just let them farm the shit out of me. xD
---
I'd like to not have a black screen for 4 seconds every time I use my power. And the problem with Legions add ons is that they all suck because they don't do anything. Frank's Mixture makes them worse than old legion with no add ons. They just have a linear boring playstyle now.
---
Thats weird it counts the EGC-Entity-Stab as an interaction.  Then again this is the game where a cosmetic makes someone invincible so I'm not too surprised.
---
You can take him further and drop him. Letting him reach the edge is just teasing him with an escape.
---
If you want to see the entity you can drop him further from the gate and you know they won’t crawl to it in time.
---
And I’m not even going to assume that was his intention, it wasn’t stated.
---
Why?
---
Groovy
---
tbh, there are so many bugs with this patch that i'm not even surprised
---
Every single time
---
Does the lore explicitly say the Doctor killed anybody?
---
Dream Demons traded him to The Entity.
---
This is ez money for her
---
It basically gets rid of everything you got besides the 3 perks and gives you a slight bonus for rarer stuff besides the bloody clothing.
---
Personally I don't see why people think legion is bad. Sure, they don't have anything amazing, but they have pretty much everything.
---
Chase, stall, slowdown, tracking, pressure, mobility.
---
They are a jack of all trades killer.
---
Joining a party as killer is a big jar of no thanks for me
---
Excuse the poor photo quality! I have only ever played killer twice before, and that was Legion. Mostly I’m a survivor main but after getting fed up with looping the killer while no gens were being worked on, being camped/tunneled by ghostface and leatherface, or just generally not being great at stealth as a whole, I wanted to see it from the other side!
---
And holy SHIT that felt good. I hit so many ambushes and just had an all around awesome time! She feels so stealthy and I love it. Pressuring the survivors to slow down gens by having 3 people bear trapped let me come back from an early 3 gens popping. Ended the match with 3 kills, a closed hatch, and 6 or 7 hooks. I might be a Pig main now
---
Audio is so fucked it makes the game unplayable
---
I've seen a few people post their designs from the forums here, so here's mine :9
---
Originally the henley was gonna be navy blue, but since it'd be too dark I changed it to light beige - the hat and default shirt are also there to keep the design easy to see
---
-and sorry about all the text, ain't drawn in months and since it was a concept, I wanted everything to be as clear as possible to any devs that come across it.  Don't think I'll win at all, but it was fun to try :p
---
He isn’t bad. At least in my opinion. But his add-ons don’t work.
---
dev support Kappa
---
I don't know why they added that considering Myers is the only stealth ability with decetion immunity
---
I hope it does. I joined this game last year on summer bbq. It'll be nostalgic, especially the menu music
---
Oh man! On the scale of laughing my ass off to wanna rip my hairs out, I would say 'Not Today' was super fun.
---
I simply grabbed Deliverance for that and as I am good at sneaking, I would simply wait for the killer to hook somebody. Then, run to save him and when Killer will return to hook, I will be there butt dancing. 
---
Sometimes, I will immediately unhook myself. And Killer would be like what the hell he is doing?
---
It was a bit toxic but super fun.
---
Can you not open lockers with that build I dont get it
---
Ghostface dies, it's just never one person so he doesn't die
---
Every killer after Nurse was released, excluding Spirit, came with some sort of gen stall:
---
Doctor: Overcharged
---
Hag: Ruin
---
Myers: Dying Light (lol, sucks ass but it does slow repair speed)
---
Freddy: Dream state halves speed of repairs, healing, and sabotage
---
Huntress: Hex HL increases skill check regression and makes them harder to hit, so technically but this is stretching it. 
---
It's almost like the game ends too quickly and every killer needed a method for stalling put into their base kit.
---
You’re complaining about hex perks my guy. 
---
Cleanse totems.......
---
This is the issue I think....he doesnt seem to have fun unless he feels like hes winning, which sucks for him and his viewers. Itd be nice if he could just learn to chill a little. I like tru3 a lot, but he is definitely getting burnt out I think. :(
---
Which map? I bet it was swamp. Hatch is a pain to find on those maps
---
origami?
---
That's the problem with both sides, each one thinks they favor the other.
---
While yes, it is more suvivior sided, that's cause they are both more popular and there is 4 against one
---
How many god damn bugs came with this patch. 🤦 The devs got a lot of stuff to fix.
---
I mean you got him to use up 2 play with your food stacks that's a win
---
Myers' Evil Incarnate. Where you had to kill all 4 survivors with tombstone and not ebony mori.
---
As soon as Survs will realise you are hunting achievement they will start hiding in lockers to deny you.
---
Bless one kind Meg tho, who was left in swamp with a coward Bill. She helped me track him down and then gladly gave herself as well for letting me complete that.
---
Even though those are bugs and not balancing
---
"Well that's because I'm very important to me"

-Bruce Campell as Ash
---
Thank God for Bruce living in the same timeline as me

Funny thing is that none of these perks seem to be really helpful

Definitely not playing any more killer until the next patch drops. 
---
This is fucked
---
Ruin, bbq, nurses calling and sloppy butcher
---
Make your choice and m&amp;a are also really good on hag
---
Another guy right before me went through no problem, it was just me. On accident.
---
damn

You kind of have to Blink to hit Survivors unless they're complete potatoes and let you just float up to them and get a hit off somehow with your 96% Movement speed.
---
That's me. If it mean getting it done so the other can escape than I'm ok with it.
---
Her injuries are based on illness. Her body deteriorated as a result of the Plague.
---
Original image is from some fan concept art [here](https://twitter.com/spitfiremichina/status/1103017952859877376).
---
Also Thanataphobia.
---
Hes okay. Not a miller you will see at high ranks. You will just regret not getting BBQ a few weeks down the road if you dont unlock it first.   It's fun to get a double down with LF though.
---
For the same reason all killers (besides Myers) have to beg the entity with an offering just to murder the little shits: it's just how the game works, get over it.
---
All I see is Laurie?
---
I wish it actually worked half the time. I swear it’s the most frustrating perk to use.
---
Open the exit games faster and telling all other survivors you're opening that is gate not bad at all
---
People really don't like self promotion just so you know
---
You get the knife the body then Mask. I already got him p3 and I definitely don't recommend it because I'm getting nothing I want in my bloodwebs it's better to stick to just having him lvl 50 and not Prestiged then Prestiged
---
even cannibal has one ?
---
wait so there is stuff for LF ?
---
I used to main nea but now I also main Jeff. I love him
---
Lol
---
Then you hit DS but the Huntress/ Spirit/ Nurse/ Clown downs you again literally 15 seconds later
---
The worst thing about all of this: they KNOW, and most of the time they don’t do anything about it.
---
I mean honestly it should be F2P, especially with the battle pass coming
---
I also see you often, I never thought I would since I don't quite remember stuff, but I started to recognize a lot of people on this sub
---
Had 5 in one match and the killer slugged and tunneled. We all got less than 7k each while the killer only got 15k (15k less than what they would have gotten playing normally or farming)
---
it's not for no reason. it's because they were toxic.
---
It’s a bug.
---
I think you meant survivors shouldn't have second chance perks
---
Urban Evasion; normal crouch speed is slightly faster than sprint burst. 
---
Unless you’re a Claudette with self care and ignore objectives, it grants an Ebony Mori to the killer immediately.
---
Because he's extremely fun to play. He's not top tier, he's not trash - he's just fun.
---
O            K
---
The perk checks where the killer is the second you push the button. You started it too early, it only looks like the killer was in range because there's where he was when the animation started
---
African American Dwight with invisible Claudette clothing
---
I got the plat recently and my first thought was "now I can play the game however I want"
---
I don't have all the dlc trophies yet though
---
Thank you for this useless information that will now haunt me
---
Whats the kids name?
---
Which killers dont need add on reworks at this point?
---
Myers and Doctor?
---
Add ons should not make a killer function, but enchace or add new styles
---
Just stand still
---
They won‘t because of balancing issues that it entails.
---
I’ve seen the ghost almost every game while someone gets taken up.  And in random places
---
He actually doesn't run enduring/spirit fury on every killer, but yea, its common on most his killers.
---
I do
---
Was he running thanatophobia by any chance?
---
I think you mean Shadowborn for increased field of view, lightborn doesn't change vision anymore. But I used a bit of that strategy too, it felt dirty at times but gotta get that achievement some how. I also farmed it a little some times if survivors wanted to farm for some reason and I happened to be on huntress. But nurse's calling helped me with that achievement, probably the only time I want an open corn map.
---
I love it lol
---
Hm, now that you mention it, I’m not sure. Is that glitched?
---
Which is the exact opposite of what the add-ons I listed do. They don’t work. They don’t enhance OR add new styles
---
It's just bugged lobbies man chill
---
because it’s BHVR. they fuck up stuff literally every time they touch the games code. still unsure as to why people get so surprised when things are broken after an update, since it’s been happening since the games debut.
---
Nice job! You chose a good time to pick her up as she will be getting new cosmetics some time in the future. She’s a lot of fun, too.
---
It’s making certain HUD parts (Healing bar, skill checks etc) to not show up currently sometimes. I’m not sure if it’s just invisible or completely not working.
---
Rarely see him without it. I'm currently rank one killer and survivor and rarely come accross spirit fury and enduring .  I know it's decent but to me it's a waste of two slots
---
Ghostface is the stronger killer IMO. He’s also cheaper than the Legion chapter. I love playing them both but to anyone else I’d have to suggest buying GF over Legion.
---
dev support fixing things they constantly break lmao
---
Ghost face one billion percent
---
It’s a really broken game, but it can be fun.
---
I’ve seen the leaked cosmetics, so I’m doubly hyped about pig
---
Sook some more?
---
I plead the fifth
---
You always have to blink as nurse.
---
If there are no objects between you and the survivor and you try to chase by just walking up to them you'll never catch up because she moves slower than them.
---
I'd change Relentless Pursuit to do something like: 
---
Any time you would be stunned by a pallet you instead intercept the action with your unholy gauntlet, overpowering the survivor's attempt.  
---
This action can only occur once every 60/50/40 seconds.  
---
Everything else seems pretty good, though.  I love the idea of a living suit of armor/Dullahan and the backstory is a lot better than the standard murderer spiel.
---
No thanks.
---
the devs weren’t good at coding from the beginning, so basically the game was spaghetti coded and they still aren’t good at coding so they make more spaghetti code on top of the old spaghetti code and it messes stuff up every time. things get broken every update.
---
Ghostface for sure.
---
Legion is cool, but after about 10 hours with him you'll be bored with him. You can really only ay Legion 1 way efficiently
---
With Ghostface you've got many options and mind game potential.
---
Plus you can teabag back at survivors, so there's that lol
---
Can make for some flashy saves.(no pun intended)
---
Also you can teabag survivors which is fun by itself.
---
They're both fun, but ghostface is more fun. Legion is only fun if youre good a juggling survivors.
---
Probably because Spirit Fury is fun and strong. The game is so much worse when you don't have those perks.
---
Got my next drawing prompt now
---
I didn't know that happened but I don't even need more context then that, that's pretty douchey
---
I mean it's for loops. Billy gets looped just like every other killer in the game.
---
Premonition:
---
You have the undeniable capability to sense danger.
---
Get an auditory warning when looking in the direction of the Killer in a 45° cone within a range of 36 metres and reveal their aura for 5 seconds.
---
Premonition has a cool-down of 45/35/25 seconds each time it activates.
---
Premonition trumps any of the Killer's stealth abilities
---
Fire Up:
---
The increased pressure of losing your preys fills you with anger and gives you unsuspected motivation. Each time the Survivors complete repairs on a Generator, Fire Up grows in power.
---
For each Generator completed, perform all actions 5/7.5/10 % faster for the remainder of the Trial.
---
Cant tell if your making fun of me gold or agreeing but yeah I suppose
---
That ain’t Jamie lee Curtis, so it must be the 2007 remake Strode
---
It is meta. There's usually 2 a game. It's not OP, but it's a very common perk.
---
It was a pretty big deal a few months ago that was a big deal among the DBD twitch community. Tyde basically lost his shit and was attacking anyone who disagreed with him and it really spiralled out of control
---
Some salty Survivor main downvoted this like it's any of his business what perks others enjoy playing with... lol
---
Eighth!
---
I feel under pressure now...
---
I loved the old lighting. Going back through old clips on Lery's was actually really creepy.
---
Myers just looks at you and thinks: “Did this fucker just shoot me?”
---
You think a bullet can stop the trapper? I think he'd be solid "oof" tier, or at least "cries out an slows a bit."
---
I was doing that tree loop with the cows hanging down on a farm map and I got hit by a clown as I ran by the window, I looped him around it again and fake ran to the window (he was on the other side) he swung and tried to get another hit through it and missed because I expected it, I immediately got as close to the vault point that I could and pointed at him, he knifed me through it and that was the best end to I loop I've ever had.
---
When the big name streamers jump in on being cunts instead of promoting people to not use the busted thing, they should be handing out perma bans to all.
---
there should be a little ding to let you know when your able to use head on
---
Every time I think this patch can’t possibly get any more broken...
---
Your face when you rerealize dbd is a broken game
---
Yeah! I really wished they changed it back, or made it so the map had lights around that turned on when generators got done, like in the blinking light houses. But I really wish they kept it for Lery’s. Like you said, was really creepy.
---
If you haven’t tried yet, maybe verifying the integrity of the game files?
---
If all else fails maybe try doing a clean install of the game. The graphics doing that would drive me insane.
---
I absolutely Love the old grab animation. Felt really powerful
---
&gt; Taking it with a grain of salt. Cause they did that whole message board in game about the legion and the blades, havent seen anything about wake up in game yet. And that does me a concern.
---
$100 says they won't ban any of the high profile streamers who have been proven to be using it, including several of the so-called fog whispers
---
Hatch is revealed when:
---
Number of generators complete = Survivors alive + 1
---
Hatch always reveals and opens when there is only 1 Survivor remaining
---
I could see it being less toxic if it wasn't directly in front of the escape area.
---
Wiggling out does give survival points
---
It doesn't eliminate the problem of him being a fucking doll which has doll's weaknesses.
---
Jeez, the level people stoop to.
---
Yeah! Don’t know why they changed it. Seeing the survivor struggle and grab on to the window, as you dragged them off it was way better than just grabbing them by the shirt.
---
How is the doctor undead? The only undead is the spirit, I think the plague and hag were taken before they died and are sustained with the Entity's will.
---
Well u shot only 1 legion
---
But this isn’t that ghost face. This is Danny Johnson, the reporter.
---
This has actually been my alarm for about half a year so it feels weird to watch the video again
---
Shit you’re right I don’t play survivor often, so...
---
Ghostface is stronger + only available via cold hard cash
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Legion is weak but generates a lot of points and is fun at times but can eventually be bought by shards if you save enough.
---
If you made it your alarm on an iPhone I’d love to know how you went about it!

This would be cool in theory, but a lot of killers would just dodge lobbies like crazy when it was an obvious SWF group IMO.
---
Are you sure this is the case? With Remember Me, the obsession is SUPPOSED to open the gate faster
---
yeah you're right but i would exclude the killer from seeing the ranks
---
I don't believe so. Pretty sure I got someone with Q&amp;Q earlier.
---
Wraith is definitely at least on the Hag's level.
---
If you have other cosmetics for him dont prestige
---
I wasn’t the obsession, it was a Laurie.
---
It would a large portion of cunts from the game, and give a mighty influx of cash to bhvr when they buy it again under  an alt account.
---
I got called a slugger and camper for downing all 4 survivors trying to swarm the hook when i had tier 3 myers. Out of all the timings and killers to ambush a hook at once they chose a myers in tier 3
---
Remember Me is also bugged. It is supposed to add time to gate opening, but LITERALLY works IN REVERSE. It speeds up survivor gate opening speeds.
---
That was a fire ass comparison
---
He is a straight up walking corpse.
---
The huntress one is 20 on PC. The Hex one is 100.
---
Best response ever!
---
Went off him a while ago. His fan base are almost as terrible as he is, too. Almost every streamer with a few hundred followers or more seems to have such a huge, inflated ego, with rabid fans who will jump on you for any lick of criticism -- and his viewers are some of the worst.
---
I was once one of his subs. He very obviously farmed someone on a hook (intentionally or not) and when I asked him why he did that instead of unhooking quicker or trying another strat (because he could have) he just got mad and ranted about me for a few minutes. Complaining that my sub must have been "gifted" and saying things like "this is what happens when people abuse gifted subs, guys". Got a few PMs from his viewers too tell me how terrible of a person I was for daring to go against Tru3. I also tried to contact him over Discord to rectify it because I really, really did want to like him, but he's consistently delusional and stood his ground and pretty much ignored whatever I was saying.
---
make a sense now ty
---
What are you talking about? Wraith is an african immigrant who was happy living in his little slice of the american dream, and the doctor is an american boy that was recruited to into the CIA.
---
The old fog was cool as shit also.
---
Wrong. We all know it takes at least 2 bullets to kill Ghostface. He always comes back.
---
No, you have to work for your achievements. I'm not giving you free shit.
---
110% agree. Was a lot harder to see the killer too, made for a lot more fun moments.
---
Totem cleansing is key but survivor mains complain that's it's too much work. But me the survivor/killer gets mad when I get hit with noed but I'm mad at me because I try to get at least 3 totems per game if possible
---
Oh yah Shadowborn not lightborn, mixed up those two.
---
I loved the old lighting also the old killer animations, the old stun and pallet stomp in first person was awesome better and you could actually look down and see your legs as the killer before but now you can't anymore.
---
There is the bloody set, which you get one piece of every time you prestige, and he has a head cosmetic of the faces of each of the first 4 survivors, gotten by killing each of those survs 50 times each.
---
You are mostly welcome dear, btw don't be afraid to play killer again sometime, it can be extremely frustrating and it may or may not make you want to die but it's rewarding in the end! Just don't play doctor, you might end up going to a asylum or something
---
Good actors usually have something in common with the roles they play. Will smith is... will smith in most movies he's in.
---
How is he possible a walking corpse?
---
It’s always the right time to blink with the nurse. Unless you’re within lunge range of a survivor, you’re gonna want to blink everywhere.
---
Now her hum is stick in my head again, FUCK
---
Left Behind should give 7% haste until end game collapse is initiated.
---
Now her hum is stuck in my head again, Fuck!
---
Just master all the killers and be a toxic af survivor, you’ll get another 2,000 hours of gameplay from that shit
---
Going in a locker stops you from being seen by BBQ?
---
Known bug maybe? Could be intentional but the devs always mess up the sound each update
---
This is why I like Warframe because they can push fixes on PC right away get out the bugs then send the console patch out with all the fixes I think they should adopt that way because then more patches can be done to PC to better have it stable more faster
---
And the hag is just a corpse held together by mud but still david doesnt punch her in the face
---
Haha thanks for the tip! I’ll keep trying :) I love playing against dr tho! Hopefully I’ll see you in game
---
Congrats!
---
Nice, how u get that MASK?
---
I think all nurses have this mask, don't know how or when i got it but i got it lol.
---
Doctor has lightning powers and wire veins he's on some zombie shit

---
Identity V actually has a mode like that. 2v8 on huge maps, has new mechanics as well.
---
More gens must be done though to balance it out.
---
The game mode seems balanced IMO. 2v8 might be possible in this game if perks were removed.
---
Yes.
---
I agree
---
It says tremendously makes it difficult but it lowers the percentage of damage to generators by 3 to 4 to 5
---
Happy cakeday cuntbag!
---
A friend of mine says that they didn't. Clearly, they were right.
---
Might have just failed to patch it or people found a new method.
---
Over what?
---
Check the integrity of your files. I used to have this bug too. Checking the integrity of my dbd file before I play fixed the bug. :)
---
Why can't tombstone Myers open the locker?
---
#[**HEAVY BREATHING INTENSIFIES**](/intensifies)
---
The licensed killers are from movies so..
---
The shape/Myers- Halloween series
---
The Cannibal/Leatherface-Texas chainsaw series
---
The Pig- Saw series
---
Ghost face- Scream series
---
The Nightmare/Freddy- nightmare on elm street
---
It will be a fabjulous day! And its coming real soon!
---
Funny thing is i could have got the 4k if i didnt slug the guy, i just dont like slugging. I knew where the last one was and everything
---
Tydetyme and bricky have some really good guides on youtube so i’d check those out!  Welcome back!
---
I want on or all of them
---
It’s all about preference really, that or the perks for the characters.
---
Franklin’s Demise, Make Your Choice, Pop Goes The Weasel, Barbecue And Chili, Hex Ruin, Overcharge, Monitor And Abuse, Hex Devour Hope. Those are just some of the things that you can run that completely out class fucking UNRELENTING. Unless you don’t ever use blinks, don’t run it. Territorial Imperative works better on Nurse than Unrelenting and that’s saying a lot. Replace Unrelenting with anything you got, it’s a waste of space.
---
Well I play both pretty equally but you're welcome :D
---
It’s a vicious cycle
---
I just find her ability so unique. It makes the Survivors play completely different compared to other killers and I’ve always been very good with sound. She also allows me to take control of the map and generators against high skilled players (hence the no Ruin). 
---
I naturally became godlike with her and can definitely agree with the 3k/4k’s every match. It’s a great feeling :)
---
Doctor's good for new players, is simple to pick up and play and can farm points like crazy.
---
Myers is the most fun of all the purchasable ones, and spirit tied second for me. I say one of those two
---
It's view count. He'll lose more money (ostensibly) playing DbD upset then Mord, MK11, or FH happy.
---
He also likes DbD but he's clearly burnt out. He was ok with it when MK11 was live and he was between the 2. But 1000s of views less is risky, easier to bet on the more sure thing.
---
I want him to play the new Death Garden, I think he could raise interest and feel like a true power role when he plays it. DbD is balanced better for 3v1 than 4v1, and it can get very frustrating.
---
Not a merciless but i got my 4k just now. Bronze gatekeeper, iridescent devout and malicious and gold chaser. Match was intense and i barely got the 4k. I need to work on my wiffs now. Got the feeling of her blinks down.
---
I think it's an extension of his brainwashing research at Lery's during WWII.
---
Did you bought it from Wall greens? Only wallgreens have the original headons
---
&gt; finishing moves in mortal kombat! who doesn't like watching those??
---
when im playing competitively &amp; the fatalities take just as long as the match does &amp; i've seen all of them 50 times over. ME god damn it now stop wasting my time on a special win animation &amp; start the next match.
---
Mori's are different though, actually have a different use outside of the regular gameplay loop
---
What if chuky's was (another) stealth killer depending on a jumping lunge attack giving survivor a prompt to catch him out of the air and trow him away, of course the window to react should be very small
---
😂 I feel so stupid. I'm always telling people I hate tombstone myers and this is the dumbest counter to it but my google assistant reading this trending to me was funny as hell because only then i realized "wow that's an actual simple counter to that."
---
I got sloppy from the blood web and now unrelenting is poofed out my build. Before i got the blinks down ive had actual use out of it to be honest.
---
Besides Ghostface which is the only licensed killer that is technically not from a movie  leatherface, Myers,The Pig and Freddy are abvious but the original killers aren't from anything
---
I was happy that they're finally fixing sounds after months.... Now soo many things are bugged. Wake up, sprint burst, legions blade add ons, thanatophobia and token perks
---
I busted my ass to get 3 gens down with only 1 other survivor. Get through gate and still die from the timer. What the fuck? I was 20 yards past the exit...
---
Dont get caught. Finish a gen before the unhook if you want the altruism points. First phase is one minute, entity phase is another. Plenty of time to knock a gen out before unhooking. After the unhook, either run away and hide or if they tunnel, do another gen. Honestly theres not much room for much else.
---
Like if someone is straight up camping a hook, you really can't do anything but start ramming gens. That survivor got the L this time, and if you try to go save him with the killer so close, you'll just cost him an extra hooking.
---
Ghostface we got isn't actually from scream just a reporter wearing the mask that took the name Ghostface as his serial killer name
---
Yay! Congrats! 
---
For Gatekeeper get a game slower perk like Ruin or as one other person mentioned Thanato 
---
You want as many gens in play as you can for the first 9 minutes of game. Chaser is a tricky one tho. You need to end chases quickly but you also need a lot of chases to get more points.
---
But if you keep blinking from gen to gen that should help with both of them.
---
I’m not really a new player, but I am a very new killer player. I really enjoy the pig. I picked her up recently, she’s fairly straightforward. It helps if you have experience as a survivor so you know how survivors tend to act in certain situations (after an unhook, where to heal, when to get in a locker) because pig is all about stealth.
---
A good 4 man swf group simply isn't fun to play against. 
---
I get where he's coming from.  But I also see where you're coming from.  
---
Take a break from true and check in soon. I also find watching the same person over and over is pretty tiring in itself.
---
Awesome job! I’m terrible at chases, but this was awesome to watch!
---
Imagine if she had insta down hatchets with iron maiden
---
I hate how you have to run rule set no. 2 and tampered timer together for the traps to not be a joke
---
Borrowed time can help, but most people just start doing gens. You can get some off while the killer just stays with that person.
---
\*mommy
---
Imagine huntress and Billy
---
In lerys
---
I don't think they'll actually ban anyone for it without warning everyone first for this exact reason. Some people just don't know about it and use it by accident
---
Exclusivity imo at least kills games whether it be console or pc, if you only release something to half the fan base then what do you expect when the game dies? If more hype would’ve been out around the game and if console would’ve gotten it I think it’d be an it bigger
---
Has he failed at this before?
---
If not, give him a chance. One chance. Does that sound fair?
---
This is good
---
Since ghostface is licensed you have to buy him with real money instead of shards. So spirit, but as a spirit main you won’t be disappointed.
---
Always
---
Then perhaps use Pop goes the weasel, its a real helper in cooling down gens. Also I would suggest to drop one of the tracking perks as you have 3 of them.
---
It might also help you to become a better tracker on your own. I too have same principle when it comes to perk that they are meant to cover up my weaknesses but if stopping gens pop up too fast is a problem, then you need to cover that as a weakness for yourself too.
---
You can purchase Ghostface with shards?
---
I think you should run Whispers over Bitter Murmer, but otherwise solid build
---
I’m right there with you! Seriously though, great chase 😊
---
I mean, the act of it in general. Since, most of the time you will get hooked
---
They only released it to PC because they want it to have a stable community before expanding. As if there is not enough interest on one console, then there will likely not be enough interest on other consoles to warrant a port. Dbd received a console port as it had been well received and populated. Unlike Deathgarden which is basically dead
---
Amen?
---
I sadly dont have pop goes the weasel. My luck is great enough to have spirit fury 3 lol.
---
I think doctor and hillbilly could take a bullet
---
Ghostface is a licensed killer you need to purchase him because if he was available with iridescent shards the company that made the mask wouldn't get any of the profits.
---
I'm leaning more towards him tbh. Woukd you day he's a strong killer?
---
All of you are wonderful with sound advice! Ty very much! Being a new player to a game like this can take some time to learn, and can also be very frustrating. I’m very thankful that this group exists so us new players can ask questions 😊
---
This is more a result of the killers he encountered most being the free to play ones most likely
---
Damn that's dark. But I love how much you went in depth with it.
---
Ahhh dammit I forgot, thank you for reminding me
---
Ah i forgot
---
He is also getting nerfed in a hotfix making him easier to spot btw
---
The dude cries out in pain when he gets hit with a dang flashlight, I'm sure a swift kick to the knees would just end him.
---
No problem! You can buy spirit, clown, plague, legion and the other non licensed ones (if you aren’t on console) with shards. I bought spirit with them myself.
---
if you know what you're doing yes, Ghostface is a licensed killer though so you would have to buy him with real money.
---
I like playing as both survivor and killer. I always play fair and clean - gotta make sure it's a fun game for everyone!
---
Deathgarden is trash. Great concept but horrible execution. DBD is 100x better
---
It’s a good thing we’re getting dedicated servers
---
Are we talking about the same ScottJund? The guy is an insufferable douchebag who, while being skilled at the game, is no where near perfect, much less "unbiased".
---
If anything him and his/Jen's "clique" of friends are detrimental to the long term health of the game give their views and biases.
---
She is definitely not the easiest. But I would agree similar to Nurse, as soon as you get really good with her it’s hard to do bad.  I counter Red Rank Spirits all the time without Iron Will or Spine Chill. It goes both ways.
---
I stopped watching him when I heard him say that nurse was not broken
---
Imagine this coming around all sneaky and shit
---
A few ! Lol
---
Stop with Chucky ffs.
---
Because you are full aware it is bugged and provides unfair exploited advantage against killer players. If you still use it, while "blaming devs" you deserve a ban. You could change your build, until they fix it, but you made a choice to abuse the exploit and it is not their fault, but your own you made such a choice.
---
The killer was waiting for me. If I would've done that I would've died
---
If you're skilled at mindgaming, not that great, bit it *can* be useful in certain situations.
---
after the fact i saw that a lot of is kinda unintentionally clementine-esque lol
---
What were your experiences as killer like? Not often do survivor only or survivor mains play killer so I'm surprised to get their perspective.
---
Sort of yeah, I watch carefully and predict movements
---
OH FUCK ITS A PUM- oh wait its just ghostface
---
Run borrowed time. It helps you save from camping killers. 
---
If ur the one being camped. Run decisive strike. It lets you stab them if they down you too soon off the hook
---
As another person has mentioned, it's borderline unfair on Nurse. I imagine it's strong on Spirit as well. If you can force a rushed action (which will happen almost every chase,) it's a 100% guaranteed hit without having to think at all. 
---
It's *okay* on other killers just to avoid guessing, but it's more easily utilized by Nurse.
---
Well, at least you knew where they were most of the time, right? lol
---
This post out of context would be problematic lol
---
And now ur butt dancing! Very mature I'm leaving...
---
Haven't seen this posted yet;
---
After update 3.0.0 when I hook 4 different survivors with BBQ it only stacks up to 3 in stead of 4 before, is this a known bug?
---
This is a good shitpost.  Parry this, you fucking casual. Right in muh funny bone, OP!   lol
---
as a trapper main i absolutely love haddonfield. Basically no chance against him there
---
You realize youre defending my point? Just play the fucking game. Wanna teabag? Go for it, wanna run NOED on billy or bubba? Go for it. Don't let being called "toxic" discourage you from how you wanna play.
---
Just play against shitty killers! I'm lucky to get one sacrifice.
---
Hey if you’re in NA i can help you with the game a bit. I currently have just under 1.5k hours
---
Bro idk how many games in a row now as a survivor my dumbass teammates have done nothing so i get eventually taken down during the last generator
---
Kind of lame for them to sweat like that. I'd have taken the L and let you live.
---
I say yeah
---
Honestly i think low key as dlc pig is one of the best ones if ur looking dlc wise
---
Ps4 NA
---
I keep spawning in unable to heal myself with self care or a med kit. I have tried with and without the perk it still happens. I also can't escape the doors when I am experiencing this as well. So the killer gets to laugh at me coming back in to kill me cause they won't be fair and give me the win I already earned with via the hatch.
---
Distortion*. 
---
And it's not a good perk. If you could re earn the tokens like stake out then it'd be god tier for stealth builds
---
Well I'm me she is expert in traps and stuff right,also she dived into needle in like saw2
---
I would second Myers but that's just because he's my personal favorite... obviously.
---
His ability to level up Evil Within is very cool and he gets stronger/faster each tier. His tier 3 lunge is an instadown and has insane range. 
---
That and tombstoning folks occasionally is fun :)
---
I usually use Distressing, Ruin, BBQ (for BPs) or Brutal Strength, and Unrelenting (I'm swing happy).
---
Gets a lot of BPs with that build w/ BBQ.
---
You want a bigger terror radius to keep the madness going.
---
Add-ons - usually Order or Calm, and something to extend the shock therapy's range. 
---
He can be quite disruptive and, if you can keep Ruin up through a few people being hooked, usually results in at least a 3k.
---
You could have healed outside ran back in and then out
---
There is no proof of better items when you prestige but you do get special clothing for doing it.
---
That's called being a dick. Its not very hard to do.
---
Lol!
---
I didnt have the option to heal. I thought of that, but I couldn't.
---
He's the only killer actually getting it on, with 
---
The Nurse non the less.
---
Besides the clothes and achievements not at all is it worth it
---
Making people dc doesn’t make you good..
---
 [https://twitter.com/DeadbyBHVR\_JP/status/1141043159843135490](https://twitter.com/DeadbyBHVR_JP/status/1141043159843135490) u mean this?
---
Yeeeee
---
I'll second this one.
---
Yes! Thank you so much
---
So you're proud you're making people DC. You are the definition of a cunt
---
Myers is decent and really fun imo. Spirit is the strongest of the dlc and also gets you Spirit Fury which is a great perk. Hag is also fairly decent and lets you unlock Ruin which is by far the strongest perk in the game.
---
Hard to say I "made" anyone D/C, im using a brown medkit, a non toxic build, no tbag, all i did was survive chases and play the game.
---
Get hag, she’s super fun. Leather face isn’t bad just a less powerful version of billy. Also he has bbq and chili which is a perk you def want.
---
Usually, but with the current bug it still doesn't work. Gotta go through the hatch.
---
Not sure why you’re flaunting your history of making killers quit then
---
They could just make killer lobbies 30 minutes long. I already don't play DBD because I'm not going to wait 15-20 min for a lobby.
---
I wouldn't notice the buff that would make traps never be removed on first box. Mine is ALWAYS in the last box. Add to that the fact that most Pigs I face camp the boxes to keep me from playing the game, or crouch camp the hook I'm on, and I wish that killer would be deleted.
---
When played fairly, she is mid-tier. Her addons are (mostly) useless. 
---
When played like a dick, I'd rather have someone burn a penis brand into my forehead than face her in a full game. Especially those people who do her pitifully slow teabag when they down me as the last survivor at the EGC. Like, fuck, do I hate your ass. Just hook me and be done with it.
---
Sorry if it seems like I'm a Pig hater, but between the toxicity of the people I face that use her, and the level of low-brow "oink" spam I see on this sub, I definitely don't like her fanbase. Love the killer as a concept, but not a fan of the people she attracts.
---
Gen Protector:
---
BBQ, Ruin, Distressing, Unnerving Presence
---
**OR**
---
BBQ, Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving Presence
---
Use "Calm" addons
---
Aggressive:
---
BBQ, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Ruin (Pretty basic build) (addons don't matter for this one)
---
Slugging Doc:
---
BBQ, Distressing, Infectious Fright, Knockout/Hex: The Third Seal (knockout is more reliable)
---
Sneaky Doc:
---
M&amp;A, BBQ, Ruin, + Perk of choice, to play as sneaky doc you must use both "Calm" addons and walk around in punishment mode, this combined with M&amp;A gives you a very small terror radius.
---
"Can't Hide From Me" Doctor
---
BBQ, Ruin, Distressing, Iron Maiden
---
Different addon combos:
---
Interview Tape + High Stimulus Electrode = Sniper Doctor
---
Both Discipline add-ons = insta t3 madness doc
---
High Stimulus Electrode + Iridescent King = confusing asf for survivors
---
That's things ugly as hell what the fuck
---
Myers would murder all of the Ghostfaces
---
If it's that unappreciated then my bad. 👀
---
Over those teeth?
---
Only when you go into Frenzy
---
How much for a spirit
---
If only there was some sort of bloodweb system that doesn't punish you for having all the survivors and killers.
---
Why do people make posts like this? You're literally preaching to the choir, dude. Do you think wifi hotspot killers are sitting around browsing reddit and are going to go "OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
---
Lockers stop ALL auras that you see and also any auras of you from being seen. Even survivors can't use auras like Bond to see you in a locker.
---
Do whatever makes you happy my man :). As long as you both are comfortable with it and happy that’s all that matters. Might want to make your titles less confusing though.
---
"Dude his weapon was nowhere close to me!"
---
There are some really good guides out there that can help, but honestly the right perks will help a lot. If you need help with gens discordance a legion perk would help. If tracking is a problem i’d look at some of the trappers perks.  Finding the right killer and play style also makes a difference.
---
Sometimes you draw the short straw. Just don't what some teammates will do and insta-kill yourself, thus giving the killer exactly what he wants and screwing over your team.
---
Just avoid the killer? Some one mains Claudette 😂😘 jk couldn't help it
---
Hahahha I think that some don’t realize how bad it fucks the match for everyone else
---
I've spent entire matches just petting him. I'm lucky enough to get a few killers who think it's funny and let me do it while my teammates scramble to finish gens lol
---
Yea, while saving people from hooks isn't necessarily your objective
---
So as soon as I frenzy, even if I haven't hit anyone, my terror radius is the entire map?
---
If you play with good a headset, you can drop deerstalker because you can hear the slugged survivors.
---
Fr, they just got it running decently on console, idk why they thought mobile was a good idea
---
did you apply directly to forehead?
---
What the fuck makes you people click on topics you so clearly have no interest in?
---
Yes, and for breaking pallets you need to hit someone and then vault the pallet and it will break.
---
I buy them so I have more options later.
---
','
---
Hope could last a while then, while users walk around in an area while someone else opens the exit gates.
---
Very nice. I am not too great at them myself to be honest, so it is great to see someone succeed!
---
Any meme that uses Roman Holiday is god tier. You got my upvote
---
I think he should have an ability linked to a fear mechanism. Like the doctor in a way but different.
---
Or like Ghostface they could combine docs power with someone else’s like Spirit and wallah Doctorspiritwise! 
---
Personally I think Pennywise wouldn’t make much sense even though it would be cool to see him in the game. Only problem with Pennywise is he’s another entity.
---
Holy shit man, I've never felt more connected to a person on reddit before in my life lol.
---
No but seriously, I have noticed that survivors have gotten so much better at this game too, or at least it seems like it. No one heals, hell they don't even loot chests/cleanse totems anymore. They just rush the gens and leave. It isn't fun, especially at red ranks. I've been a red rank killer for over a year, and just this week I made the decision to leave red ranks, because it's literally nothing but a genrush sweatfest. It just isn't fun.  
---
OP, take this mans advice. And trust me, don't try to get to red ranks. You will hate your life.
---
Tombstone?
---
Just your typical group of shitters. 
---
They don't win too often so they really give off that baby dick energy when they do.
---
Awesome, thanks for the help
---
Fungoose on twitch personally
---
And you thought people hated NOED. Imagine the toxic postgame chat with 「T H E  W O R L D」 equipped
---
bro, play more killer, learn them, watch youtube and you will 
---
1. be a better survivor (learning what other players do to dodge you)
---
2. understand the problems of spacific killers or certain perks
---
3. understand the pain of the current ranking system
---
4. know what is OP or too easily countere
---
5. have more of an opinion on perks and addons and killers since you will know both sides of it well
---
Lol Mori's give this game LIFE. Had so much fun lul
---
how old is he?
---
It's obvioud you got inspiration from Ochido. And that is not a good thing.
---
The music is good anyone know what it might be from?
---
I've been trying a few, but there's some "core" for her that I dont have yet. I was running   bbq, endurance, noed and bitter murmur but ended up switching bbq for  hex:thrill of the hunt because bbq randomly isn't showing suvirvors aura. I've been also pending bp on hag so I can get her hex:ruin to delay the gen rush but still have quite a few bp to go.
---
just grinded 9000 irridecant shards and got plague just to have this glitch
---
Are you sure,that ppl just didnt go in a locker ,if you hook someone to prevent you from bbqing them?
---
You may as well, alternatively, get behind cover of your own and do the same whenever he starts stalking you
---
Just check out the 4k santa clown render on reddit and you can see it clear as day
---
Lmao! This reminds me of the rank 20 Bill I played with the other day, I killed myself as soon as I was hooked just to let him excape via the hatch, and when I spectated him (i wish i didn't) he was repairing a gen!! He was like "oh only 3 gens left, better start repairing with unbreakable perk only) lol
---
they try that hard? i just run my stupid face into people while holding the stalk button. it works pretty well
---
Of course it is. But like, I'm talking about survivors who are refusing to heal, refusing to cleanse totems/loot chests, ya know secondary objectives. It just seems like more and more survivors don't care about any of that stuff anymore. 
---
Hell, some survivors don't even try to make saves and would rather sit on a gen.
---
Not always
---
/u/wisdomwielder is never kind to good boi maurice :(
---
He’s on steam so it does
---
My bad
---
I haven't seen this in this thread yet but I tried playing and I can't see generators auras or hooks I even tried survivor too no in game auras at all
---
Picture of a cat is on the perk. When the killer is looking in your direction from within a certain distance the perk lights up. So you can get prepared to evade them. There are some other bonuses and negatives that happen when spinechill I'd active as well but they are not that major
---
A lot of perks are fucked rn, Vigil, Wake Up, Thana and We'll make it at least, probably a bunch more
---
Sure you have. Everyone's always run wake up. It's always been meta. Those pesky gates am I right?  :)
---
No I don't him in the game so I wont make a power for him
---
He does admit to survivors playing well. He talks about how certain loops like the L T walls are skillful loops. He is definitely complaining a lot recently, but he is definitely just tired of dbd.
---
Yes, it is known by now, and if you had used the search function, your see the 100 some odd posts about it.
---
It's a visual bug. USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION.
---
I always heard him say that clown was an ok killer. Never heard him say he was bad.
---
I barely get the cakes but I get a fire cracker each bloodweb. Only one each bloodweb though
---
Point is End/SF isn't that great. You actually save more time with gen-defence perks than with chase perks.
---
Check in the gift boxes.
---
Oh you have fucking not dude lmao. Stop speaking out of your ass just to debate. It's a garbage perk. rEd RAnKs uSeD wAke Up bEfOrE tHe eXpLoIt. Lol, idiot.
---
So it actually has 4 stacks but shows 3?
---
Bruce is now at the ripe age of 61. Proud of him for being awesome all the way to now
---
Meanwhile console still has broken trophies...
---
You're more likely to play against newer killers that think getting that one guaranteed kill is really important. You will just have to slam gens to force them away for the save. As you play more experienced people camping does not happen as much as it usually cost the killer so many gens.
---
Skadeesh Skadeen, get this shit offa my screen!
---
You got me there, I’m beat
---
yeah i don't dislike him he's great to watch, i just prefer positive streamers and he might be good in another game for a while.
---
What is the PWYF bug?
---
Thank you!
---
Ah yes, the completely different person who is not a serial killer indeed I had the wrong man.
---
Thank you.   
---
I know spirit is hard and it probably takes a good survivor to play a good spirit, would you say it's worth learning spirit if I'm  a bad survivor? I play this game casually so I don't expect to hit red ranks, but I wouldn't like to get bullied by survivors every game at the same time.   
---
And you're right about NOED. It feels cheap and to be honest, I felt guilty every time I killed survivors because of it. I haven't had anyone complain about it yet, but it just doesn't feel satisfying. I'll remove it from my build. Do you think whispers or haunted ground can work instead? I say whispers mainly because it could help me track them
---
I dunno i see him compliment survivors all the time ?
---
Happened to me earlier
---
You’re being downvoted for a reason 💀
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
Gotta love playing Myers
---
Could've just checked the PS Store. It's one of the 4 promoted items under "New DLC".
---
Have you ever heard of "Get BHVR'ed" ?
---
He's a good killer no doubt. But he did make mistakes and it bothers me that he thinks his opinions are closer to fact. The basic point was that he hardly used gf power. If you use a regular m1 killer against a high rank swf team you are going to have a bad time.
---
Oof i missed such a chance there
---
I present to you an upvote!
---
It's funny because Ghost Face is a red head in this picture.
---
Its true he wasnt using power much at all.
---
See? Wendy’s doesn’t keep their meat frozen
---
I like to troll the killers who take me to the basement, once they almost reach the back hook I give them the fat DC
---
“I’m dead hard right now, shoot me again”
---
I was trying to get the achievement last night and oh there are so many lockers in preschool...
---
Happens to me yesterday on the same exact map! I stood there for like 10 seconds trying to figure out what the fuck just happened!
---
Id say yes.
---
I was hoping someone would say this, also don’t soldiers have fucking ASSAULT RIFLES? Not a got dam glock?
---
That wasn't an escape, it was an Excape.
---
omg ahaha. No! I'm the original artist and I'm actually American. I think I used to watch a couple Australian youtubers and they said the phrase here and there and I just picked it up!
---
I think it's because the Special Edition is on Game Pass, if you're on Xbox. Or just generally the Special Edition *exists*.
---
If you count the forums, it’s more like 200 posts about the BBQ bug.
---
Why wouldn't they wiggle?
---
Cannot count the amount of times 😂
---
Yes, but I didn't it on purpose! I have started a normal game and there it was... Another ghostface
---
I didn't try... Cuz I immediately quit
---
It only gets saltier from here
---
Truth about what? That Ghostface was both toxic and an idiot. There's your truth.
---
Are you like... Literally a moron?.
---
The ear rape in the beginning is something Ochido does and all  the sound effect for the most basic things.
---
i think it might be a survivor thing, because i have 70 gateaus on legion, 25+ on ghostface and another 20+ on doctor
---
That's wrong. Enduring/Spirit Fury is ridiculous. It cuts chases by half the time while also using valuable survivor resources.
---
Your mileage may very but this game does not play close to how it did in EA. If you really enjoyed the chases and running the killer around you can't do that anymore.
---
hey dwight look at me
---
&lt;looks&gt;
---
ah shit im out of night shroud
---
Dbd is a better GAME
---
deathgarden is a better HORROR EXPERIENCE

Jesus Christ, this post has been made atleast 8090 times since the update, first off it’s not a bug, it’s as intended. Yes the volume might be a bit too quiet but it’s as intended, so it’s not a bug. Secondly they made the update so yes they know what the sound is like. Instead of making a post that has been on this reddit atleast 30 times a day since the update maybe go onto BHVR support and notify them about this “bug” you are having.
---
Nice essay hours later again, not mentioning a single instance to enforce your point. You can throw a bunch of words together and think it makes you smart, but it doesnt. Also, this is far from shouting abuse, you're unbelievably overdramatic and now I fully understand why you'd make such an absurd and stupid claim in the first place
---
Bbqs stack number is bugged as far as i know. Lockers are hiding their auras. Maybe they are just smart survivors.
---
You can learn what are the possible locations, but that won't guarantee you knowing where they are this time if you lose track of them after the gens get popped.
---
Even knowing their possible spawns, you will spend a good chunk of time checking all of them to find the door. If you are crunched for time it can save your life.
---
The lag is never noticeable on your side when you're on WiFi.
---
*got pushed into the needles
---
Yeah I’ve seen a few people post it!
---
It’s fixed! Yay! Or was 3 hours ago but I’m not online right now
---
If the survivor is sprinting away and my Ghost Face go go ghost extendo hands over to stab them it can feel pretty bullshit. I've hit people right next and through the window, but I've also hit plenty of people that I can only assume I extendo stabbed. 
---
Also, lunging the length of a pallet feels wrong too.
---
Btw I was also being sarcastic...
---
"Do I get any say in thi-"
---
"Nope c:"
---
They’re not canonically siblings
---
then he might be the most unlucky guy on the game
---
Simply outplayed
---
She did die by being shot 1 time in the movies, soooooooooo
---
This rlly me when I’m stalkin
---
What the...
---
So you were sleeping with the blood webs wife while it watched? Or did the bloodweb sleep with your and you watched?
---
it’s all the killer mains crying bc i’m right
---
To be more precise: it makes you mori someone if you use standard M1 (so lunging doens't count) while they are still either injured or fully healed, it won't take effect if they are downed.
---
After all this discussion I went and watched the video. He couldn't use his power. The only time it'd have had any effect was if he turned off his terror radius when he saw the guy go for the unhook to turn off bt and then tunnel.  Other than that the only real mistakes were picking up the guy by cow tree at the end instead of slugging all 3. And he maybe could have opened the 99% door himself to begin endgame and put them on a timer.
---
It is not a win if someone is forced to do something that isn’t what they wanted to do.
---
Yes it was ghost face. I just bought bubba and got it as a teachable so ghost fave was my first one I unlike it for.
---
If there was a cooldown every time a generator got popped then there would be no way to punish camping, so every killer would just camp.
---
Da Fuq? That GF is blind as a bat!
---
I mean, I'm a killer main and this obviously is not a win win. It's just a straight up nerd to survivors. You can't blame them for doing their objective.
---
Ahh nice to see your artwork here again
---
How do you open the gates? I get no prompt at them as killer
---
There is actually a game breaking bug that makes them go ridiculously fast.
---
Oh sorry
---
Like what go do totems, rescue survivors, or search chests if you seriously want to hold m1 all game then something’s wrong with you.
---
Yep this is what the game is now bully simulator with all the bullshit survivors have there is no way in hell to stand a chance unless you play the holy trinity. I might be downvoted but it’s the truth any killer besides the trinity will get stompt by any good team
---
Instead of taking your time to write this whole comment, you should've just say there were already other threads for this, period. 
---
I never said or mentioned is a bug, I already said they did that on purpose, stop putting words in my mouth to prove your point. I just said is unplayable, unfair and defeats the whole purpose of the game's atmosphere.
---
Im not gonna want a nerf like that. What the devs should do is make ruin totems harder to find.
---
The game needs some major balancing on all aspects, but that's not going to happen anytime soon. You just have to play the game and feel good when you finally 4k a group of survivors.
---
No, me and Grandpa were murdered brutally by a huntress. It's ok, I just told her that we were writing her out of the will.
---
That would not work because overtime survivors will have the spots memorized and the totem would be gone in 15 seconds.
---
To be fair this happens at the other end too. Take Ghostface for example, they made him a strong killer and are nerfing him now because of survivor cry babies. Both sides are bad for THIS, BHVR are just terrible at balancing. Find a middle ground, don't just completely buff or completely nerf. Find something in between that keeps things strong but not Op and not useless either. Not saying that it's an easy job to balance but it's as if they just here "MoM is too strong!" and go "OK just make it shit now."
---
It's so long winded I find it hilarious.
---
why did I read MoM earlier but have no idea what it meant
---
but I read this and instantly say Mettle of Man
---
Is it me or has every Ghost Face you guys have ran into facecamp too?  I've played maybe 10 or so games in the past few hours and 8 were a facecamping Ghost Face.
---
Its something. If they made it constantly hard to find. I cant want something like that because the killers can still 4k with gens at the current state they are in.
---
I counted when I was making my MorezPack. 70% of purple perks deserve to be green, 40% of green perks deserve to be purple. also, there aren't 2 rarities. there are 4, but the game displays pink as purple and yellow as green to reduce the amount of sprites needed (it couldn't handle it back then)
---
Uh, you messed up covering his name over the "Poor choice" message. It's still clear as day.
---
Tbf some killers like Billy and Spirit have really long weapons, so it would be fair to give every killer similar reach through a window.
---
or just learn to apply pressure / run ruin if you struggle with it
---
It also increases vault speed
---
lul
---
The hags dlc was free...
---
How do I apply pressure as leatherface and ruin is gone in 15 seconds
---
Of course. Only a true monster would neglect to pet him!
---
That would make the game a nightmare please no.
---
Why would Myers not die
---
Its stupid I know but nerfing survs to ground wont change that.
---
Can we get a petition to make freddy's DS stun just him saying "Darn."
---
Imagine calling ghostface strong
---
I love how you can tell what the message is gonna be based purely on their profile pic. Caveria pic = salty tryhad
---
We play killer so you don't have to.
---
To be fair... I also have troubles finding the hatch as a killer. I learned that there is a windy sound queue once it's open and you are close but still
---
It would let low-mid tier killers be able to pressure gens
---
I love the art style for Ghostface and Myers. It gives off a classic cartoonish vibe that's really fun. I feel like the anime eyes hurt it a bit because of how great the rest is! I hope you'll make more DBD art OP, it's awesome and we need more!
---
this bug also includes no wiggle - recover no dead hard or anything.  you simply know if you have it or not if you cant use 1 or 2 the emotes
---
people actually play quentin?
---
He can’t mori you if you’re in a locker
---
lol he even personally attacks better players like ZubatLEL because "they always play the highest tier killers and if not they use noed"
---
Not to mention how incorrect this statement is, Tru3 is just a bald whiny bastard sometimes, even though he can be entertaining as well
---
I just wanna feed him an apple and tell him he's gonna be okay
---
Like Myers Hag level, he is a good killer and I love playing him, but fuck his power is buggy as all shit
---
Mostly because of the increased amount of wake up abusers and people running prove thyself likely.
---
No going to talk about being cut a chainsaw
---
How about buffing those killers instead of just nerfing survivors into oblivion?
---
Again: no. That you can't play the game because being hooked means you're immobilized is - again - part of the game's mechanics. So it is intended that way.
---
Yeah but then it's just an opinion. Sorry if I mistook you and you just wanted to state that, that's on me then. Anyway, have a nice day!
---
Survivors would get used to the nerf and 20 seconds isn’t that bad
---
If you knew it was done as intended why did you call it a problem? Just stop spamming this thread with these useless posts.
---
The descriptions are killing me. lol
---
Plus killers should and always be the power role for god sakes
---
Your refuring to perks like Distortion that should be Rare at Tier 1 but it's Uncommon and perks like  Sole Survivor that should be Rare at Tier 1 but is Very Rare?
---
20 seconds is a lot of time. That's a total of 80 seconds if only one person is doing gens. It's obviously an overnerf.
---
If were talking stress level my money is on nurse or spirit. If someones chasing me the last thing I want them to be able to do is go through things. I would at least like my chance of being able to try and outrun something but if this things just appearing out of thin air that's a Randy Jackson big no for me dawg.
---
Got some nsfw pics to go with those stories?
---
Trapper could be fun to play if they buff him a bit, but in his current state I can only play him after rank reset without totally getting my ass kicked :(
---
Unrelenting is meant to be a crutch for bad players that miss a lot of swings. It's most likely not going to be anything more than that. Even if they got rid of the cooldown all together, it will still always be better just to not miss.
---
I'm sorry but you're not a salty survivor. I'll give you the less detailed version. Y'know kid friendly.
---
The sperm meets the egg. The egg goes to the womb. Pregnancy lasts around 40 weeks. Bam you;re born
---
Wow, so much I didn't know. Thanks!
---
I'm not like the other killers, okay mom? lul
---
How would it make survivors impossible it’s just a minor setback and it’s 20 sec that’s half a chase
---
Get in my lobbies and you'll find out.
---
no one took lockers or disconnected in evil incarnate, you say?
---
Always! Even if I’m being chased by a chainsaw wielding maniac or a ding ding ding I always say hello whilst running for my life
---
It’s still a problem and creates games that are extremely un fun for killers
---
Caudette had some costmetic that made her immune to some shit.
---
It used to be like STBFL, granting a cooldown reduction on hit as well. I'd love to see something similar like that back. Not to the extent it was at before, of course, but something similar.
---
not play the worst killer in the game
---
Did you really throw the word kid friendly lul. 
---
I know how pregnancy works, let’s put it this way I’m old enough to have passed high school. Was just curious on what you would say. 
---
Plus Details is all that matters.
---
What rank?
---
I agree I think it would also be stressful because most of the other killers seem like you could have some sort of fight back. Like most of the killers in this games from movies have gotten into fist fights or been shot it didn't work on most of them granted but have you ever seen a movie where someone fights a ghost? Can't say I have lol. But I agree with piggy and doc because of the extra stuff they do to you would make it more painful. Leatherface seems like he might be the least painful, dude carries a hammer with him and one doink to the head and you probably wouldn't feel anything after that cause you'd be out cold lol
---
Have you played survivor ever? Look at the basic math. 20 seconds per gen, is 80 seconds of not being able to repair. That's another whole generator worth of time. But then it gets worse because a generator is just 80 seconds worth of one survivors time, and you're applying it to *all* of them.
---
This is a massive nerf and you're insane to think it's minor.
---
I'd use the detailed version but I don't want to get banned
---
It really can't be that survivor just nets 20k on average, while killer gives 30k, there's such a fundamental imbalance to it it's pissing me off. And they know that killer lobbies taking so long is a serious problem, and it's been that way for a long time, but they don't do shit to fix it. Survivor's point scoring events are mostly bull, getting 8k in survival is equivalent to seeing a fucking unicorn GAH
---
some perks are green at lvl 1, purple and lvl 2 and pink at lvl 3, but game doesn't render pink.
---
some perks start as brown, but game doesn't render that either
---
Ohhh they did!! Lots of tombstones and tuft hair wasted like that. 
---
Bless a kind Meg who decided to betray a sneaky but unhelpful Bill and then happily gave herself up as well to let me have it.
---
I'd say the plag since you'd be constantly getting puked AND puking yourself while trying to run for your life. If I was a survivor I would lose hope if I had to try and sprint while vomiting uncontrollably and  being forced to work on vomit covered generators to try and escape.
---
And..?
---
The breathing is unrealistic too, if I see a Bill 20m away from me, it sounds like he's breathing his nasty smoke breath right down my neck.
---
Awww where can I get one these are cute! She should make more and sell
---
Yes i have played survivor I’m surprised on how easy it was with friends no problem at all with all the second chance perks and insta heals literally got to rank 1 in 3 days while I’m still trying as killer
---
Ya IK I'm just trying make sure that's what you're taking about.
---
I agree that perk rareties are screwed up, I hope BHVR brings back Ultra Rare and Common perks and makes them consistent.
---
There isnt anything like element of suprise when everytime you go anywhere you sing fucking lullaby audible from 40 meters
---
I had a camping ghostface the other day.
---
Two streamers. Three Gateau's. Three of us left because he downed me early (got caught on the very edge of a fucking rock, visibly couldn't see anything in my way.) Coincidentally right next to the basement.
---
I couldn't tell he was camping thanks to his built in insidious upstairs. Two people came down and we all got downed. Our 4th managed to escape and got sufficient points though, so that's nice.
---
Felt really bad because I was the reason two people lost out on 509% though.
---
it's not just holding m1 it's the adrenaline. the feeling of besting someone who is stronger than you and has the ability to just end you then and there
---
I love it when a toxic survivor DCs when they fail at being toxic
---
When you down your obsession you do not lose a token as you both gain and lose a token. 
---
Not game breaking and actually makes the perk a little better. 
---
What's making it game breaking is using Furtive chase with this perk + Make your choice to allow the killer to constantly have 3 stacks of PWYF allowing a constant 15% movement speed buff.
---
Unless they adapt and drop pallets early. Then you've got 2 dead perks. It *can* work, but is unreliable.
---
How do you counter PGTW or Surveillance?
---
I’m sorry but it’s my opinion I’ve been  playing this game for 3 goddamn years and never in my life did I feel like survivors are weak I usually lose as survivor if I fuck up that’s it.
---
Just use No Mither, GGEZ OP PERK
---
Awesome, but your opinion would ruin the game.
---
Shame. I guess DBD but as an FPS is just a fundamentally flawed concept.
---
I’m done arguing I’ll keep thinking about and see if I make changes to the idea until then good night :)
---
What map is it?
---
Dead Hard makes you invulnerable for a split second if I recall correctly. That + the small sprint forward it does was enough to get him out, since blood warden also dropped at that specific second. (Probably because the game officially "ended" thus ended the perk's effects.)
---
If they fix the reveal mechanic I think he'll be in a great place. Hopefully they don't cave.
---
I’ve been rank 1 every time I can be bothered to grind for it, but I don’t care about rank. I’ve been there done that so there’s no need to try hard and moan about balance all the time like true.
---
Agreed

The Wake Up bug is getting worse
---
Yeah I agree, I don’t think they should make his spot radius bigger, just make it actually work. There are games when I pull him out of it over and over and there are games when I’m looking at him and he just laughs and exposes me. A nice consistent middle ground would be awesome.
---
Agreed.
---
It is a horrible idea as it would play directly in to the hands of garbage killers that facecamp.  You can't pass through any balance changes that would buff facecamping.  That would simply be absurd.
---
Yeah but it's not a huge issue if you break LOS and re-enter stealth.
---
No idea where this even comes from. There will be some adjustments to him which are already listed in the forums, yet people treat it as if it kills the character.
---
I'm confused as to why they didn't just walk out. I'm kind of new to the game so there's some things I don't know about. Did the killer have a perk or hex blocking them from escaping?
---
Do you mean downed survivors?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c3ozrn/love_it_when_a_toxic_killers_plan_backfires_on/ersh3gj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Woah.
---
Got a link to that video??
---
It looks really nice and the propertions are very accurate and clear and the details were done well but the shading could use a tiny bit of work it.the shading is good but could look a lot better.
---
What's the confusion
---
Made by the same guy who did Freddy's "Welcome to the basement" comic?
---
I’ve seen enough of this sub to know that they overreact to everything, so I’m not too concerned. 
---
GF is in a good spot, even if they nerfed his 1shot a bit, it wouldn’t really matter. The stealth is where je really excells.
---
you mean 2 minutes where you cam pop at least two gens?
---
Why buff unrelenting and not... I dunno, every killer that isn't nurse or billy
---
Oh wow. That seems kinda sh*tty for end game collapse.
---
Ahhhh friendzoned, gotcha.
---
Ghostfaces stun noise is amazing. It’s just a disappointed sigh and I love it
---
zombies die from headshot
---
Yeah, I’ve been playing the game since it came out on console and have never experienced anything like this. People need to understand that this is a living game, it’s constantly (well every 6 weeks) getting updates and fixes because as you would expect, new additions (can) create new problems. When these issues arise the devs are usually fairly good at solving them as fast as possible and make game ending bugs a priority. Now we don’t have dedicated servers yet so the issue you were experiencing could have been from the killer. Either their shitty connection or they’re doing something to cause it. It’s only a medkit, it’s only an Insta-heal. If this was happening every game than yeah sure, be pissed off but if it’s a one off for you like it is for most people, just take the loss and move on. It’s 1 game out of an infinite amount of games you’ll play, don’t let it sour your perspective of the game. 
---
Anywho, Hope you all have good games, fellow people of the fog.
---
I cannot relate. I play on Xbox where every nurse is a joke even in high ranks XD
---
It's possible for a mobile hotspot to provide a better connection than wireless router/other home Wi-Fi, of course that depends on plans and location. I would imagine most people playing on a hotspot do not have access to a better connection though, and ignoring the ping indicator prior to starting the match is kind of on that individual.  That being said, if your connection isn't great then it is probably better to stick to survivor where the worse connection doesn't effect everyone else.
---
Yeet he is headless because of decapitation
---
I went on and on about how stupid of an idea that is 5 times by now. there are much more disadvantages
---
This looks like a renaissance painting
---
Ok, this is best killer. That's some quality end game chat right there.
---
What are the disadvantages?
---
Can we rather have him say Bitch? The game is already rated for 17+ and above.
---
I've always wanted that. Give me a Killer that just fucking decks people.
---
Yeah I’m just worried they’ll nerf his looking mechanic too much and we’ll have PTR Ghostface again
---
Yeah fortunately being on console nurse isn’t as bad for us (PS4), rip PC guys though
---
So true, I stay next to him when I stun just to hear him.
---
just microsoft excel
---
rip indeed
---
&gt; especially compared to the strongest most consistent perks in the game 
---
Not everyone runs meta stuff, people like variety. I know some people who ran wake up prior to the bug.
---
You don't need crutch perks, so a slight rework to feral frenzy can go like this:
---
\+15 sec to feral frenzy, but your speed decreases back to 100%, instead of staying at 115%. That way, you'll have to rely on your skill, plus, you already get the advantage of speed vaulting, so you should be able to wound survivors.
---
It's honestly pretty balanced. It's "counterable" in the sense that if the clock os below 60 seconds, you should just leave.
---
The timer is double for egc when someone is hooked or downed (don't quote me on the specific timing) so killers would want the timer to be around 30 seconds at best.
---
Another good way to counter this is to leave the survivor on the hook for as long as possible. Maybe don't let them die but every second is a godsend. Another is to 99% the exit gates since the perk only procs once they are open. Have someone waiting/wait there if you're the only one left. Open it if egc starts ofc.
---
But ultimately if someone is downed post 60 second mark - I advise to gtfo and don't look back.
---
r/ExpandDong
---
Yeah English
---
Quentin no longer sleep deprived has awoken to his new found powers. He will no longer be the entities plaything.
---
Seriously tho lol, could this patch honestly be any more buggy?
---
I’m on about even without wake up gens just don’t exist anymore
---
Killer says don’t use Ds, Survivors asks why it’s for anti tunneling and then just a bunch of nonsense afterwards.
---
Oh and survivor called Killer a Tunneler
---
They're supposed to open it at normal speed.
---
&gt;Ghost Face go go ghost extendo hands
---
I'm sacrificed.
---
Exactlyyyyyy. She's a more bad bitch than we give her credit for
---
always have a face-off with the Pig and horsey. or a growl-off I should say !
---
I'm curious how the Devs broke all of Quentin's perks specifically. 
---
Apparently, all of his perks are now bugged.
---
In
---
Pharmacy too? What happened?
---
lit rally luv, luv xx
---
All good mate, it definitely does help to get the salt out sometimes. As much as I love the game it can irritate me to no end sometimes. Happy games friend.
---
How about the hag, shes a legit monster thing
---
look this guys:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGSLe9partQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGSLe9partQ)
---
It's amazing. My boi getting the buffs he needs.
---
But for real though, Wake Up, Vigil, and I heard Remember Me is also busted. Interesting that it's all of the NOES Perks
---
The killer tunneled us and camped.
---
No problem my friend. Thanks for respecting us, unlike 80% of the survivor mains out there.
---
Someone on the reddit earlier mentioned that they noticed that Pharmacy allowed them to do things other than opening chests faster.
---
Do not know if its true but would need to test it to check it out.
---
I usually just write 'jajajja baby killer' and leave though so you'd be like writing about pregnancy for nobody
---
Think it might be something to do with the Freddy rework like the devs have been playing around with the DLC to make it more appealing?
---
This happened to me too.
---
Tess_T_Culls
---
You're right. There shouldn't be an 8k limit to categories.
---
It should be *higher.*
---
Don't want survivors just fucking around trying to farm? Well it would be nice if you didn't cap objective bp gain at minimum of 2 and a half gens, less if you're working together. I'd happily gen jockey if I could get more points from it, but as it stands alturism is the way to go especially with wglf. (For me, anyways. I also assumed you meant they should be lower, which, if that's noy what you meant then sorry.)
---
This happened to me too, but i was the killer (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞
---
This is going to be one massive hotfix the devs are going to be releasing. 
---
I'm impressed by how they managed to create this many bugs on their anniversary.
---
Fair enough.
---
I don’t, it was a couple months ago before decisive was nerfed and before plague was added.
---
Myers: Can you leave the fcking locker?!  
---
Survivor: No, I don't think I will.
---
Unrelenting should affect cooldown of succesful attacks too
---
If Freddy can pull you in at any time like in game (and the Entity would allow him to do that), then the fact that you're not likely to sleep isn't an issue, and lore wise he can do whatever the hell he wants in the dream world. May not be as painful as others, but it'd be stressful because you have to deal with his twisted mind.
---
Also, From the power description, Legion causes internal bleeding whenever they stab you with Frenzy on top of being stabbed normally. That usually requires medical attention or even surgery, which you won't get. It may not be as lethal, but it'd be very painful.
---
Oh jesus christ, stop it with your constant victim complex
---
Might be cool
---
Not the point of the post but okay. Sometimes its necesary for a killer to tunnel to get someone out the match, same ways its sometime necesary for survivors to skip healing to do gens faster.
---
shoot him in the chest?
---
I'm not a big fan of Ghostface, but the one good thing to come out of his release is more people are playing Laurie. My girl needs some more love.
---
Them fightin words
---
you may have worded that incorrectly.
---
I learned this when playing Myers
---
Except they announced the nerf literally the day of the release, in the patch notes he came out on, before a very hefty majority of tim mains got to play against him.
---
You must be new. This is absolutely common in this game when survivor insults you for being better than him.
---
How that’s quick literally impossible?
---
...but what about the chainsaw?
---
Thank you :) &lt;3 I also enjoy playing survivor both solo and with my friends I have meg rank 50 and Im working on getting claudette up there. She's rank 36 at the moment
---
Definitely will man.
---
Yeah, I’m really happy to hear that :), there’s just been a lot of paranoia on the sub because BHVR likes to nerf killers hard after they come out while nurse and billy still get 4K games consistently.
---
Let's be real, if either one of them hit you with a chainsaw just once, that trial would be over for you.
---
I once called a killer and asshole for cheating with a survivor... he reported me and I got a warning from Sony the next day! Never use bad language on ps4.. even if they deserve it or you are joking.
---
Fair enough, I really like it and I’m not going to spend money to buy a skin for a killer I already have a cool skin for
---
Did you also notice that they change color too :^)
---
I agree completely, skill based is the way to go for strong killers, I’m just happy to have some new “high tier” blood. Nurse and billy every game gets old fast.
---
In that video the only mistake I could tell he made was not using night shroud before unhooking to counter borrowed time.  Everything else that happened was pure cancer bs that swf squad pulled to win.  He had every right to complain after that terrible match, he played extremely well while the survivors made mistakes and constantly got away with all their second chance perks.
---
Well it is a perk that most people realize is fucked up and not skilled based. Also received a huge buff by having all tiers do the same thing, so I get it.
---
To be fair it was a pretty good shot
---
The supposedly dead Ghostface would come back to life for one last scare.
---
No Mither will probably never be buffed/changed. The devs have stated that it is only meant to be hard mode, and don't want it to be a viable option.
---
Yea just like 99% of the community. I don’t see the problem
---
if you could down them quick you wouldn't be whining about adrenaline, lol. it's a high risk high reward perk bc you're playing the whole game with 1 less perk until the gates are powered. it's completely wasted if you die beforehand and only a small bonus mobility bonus to get to the door/a hooked person if not in chase, able to bodyblock at the right time, or injured. do you think hope is unfair too? 
---
wheres with noed, it's a second chance if you don't manage to kill everyone before the gates are powered. yeah it's a wasted perk if you 4k before the gates, but that means you won already, so who cares...?
---
no one survives all 5 gens everytime and no one always 4ks before the gates are open. seriously, what's hard to understand about this? high risk high reward things like these exist because they add interesting dynamics that make every match different. plenty of hexes have the same concept. add ons like tombstone. bodyblocking, and sabotaging before it basically became obsolete too.
---
Lmao absolute garbage
---
The only way to counter good looping survivors and broken map design is to use enduring SF, at least with M1 killers besides the big 3.
---
Leather face is fun tho
---
I'm saying I get it too but it gets old and just childish seeing that being their literally only counter argument. I refuse to touch NOED as a killer. I hate it from both sides. But its just stupid seeing the same repetitive counter argument instead of something new that isnt just copy pasted everywhere.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s fun, I find it annoying that I have to run it to have a chance.
---
Yea I bet. I'm just more of a stealth boi killer. I got Myers at P3 LV50 and am now playing as Pig. Ghostface also looks fun tho. But it seems that BBQ not only helps with matches but in also getting points.
---
Did you 2 hooked them all?
---
"Hello Children" - Darth Chef
---
I remember back in the day when Brutal Strength was a meta perk. It cut so much time off of breaking pallets, now its barely is worth taking.
---
I'll admit that my knowledge of game programming is incredibly limited, but how is their ability to patch limited compared to other games? Most games I see update/patch regularly and seemingly more often compared to dbd, invluding to disable things that aren't working properly. Is the company bhvr limiting the devs, or do you mean specifically on consoles, or? Sorry, I just genuinely didn't know this was an issue for them and it explains a lot.
---
Nice! I have begun prestiging my characters now.
---
Yeah u get stacks with bbq. Franklins demise is nice to when there’s 4 items in ur damned lobby
---
they are an indie game, they are probably the largest indie company, but they haven't reached the A or even B level yet. that's how.
---
The report of the week
---
I think nurse would hurt the least, especially considering her Mori. But she definitely would be very stressful to go against, considering she can teleport right to you.
---
Doctor may be one of the most stressful to go up against. Hell, I find him one of the most stressful to play against, and the game isn't even real! So if it were real, he'd definitely be devastating to survivors' mental wellbeing.
---
I think Spirit would also be stressful.
---
I think you're right on the money about pain, although I wonder how quick the RBT deaths are from the pig. Is it long enough to really suffer from pain?
---
We need a chart for this lol
---
As a survivor main, I'm loving ghost face. He brings a new challenge and forces you to keep a look out. 
---
I enjoy when I go up against a GF that scares the hell outta me when I'm working on a gen.
---
Seems the case
---
Good to know it’s not only me haha
---
T
---
Yep same
---
Yes on ps4 and there is a crazy amount of bugs.  I have been getting error codes (game crashing) at random moments. The game is a mess since ghostface, hopefully gets fixed soon..
---
Yeah the jumpscare aspect is really nice, especially when you don’t know who the killer is. Brings more horror aspects to the game that I wish would be focused on more.
---
Bruh but my rank (that doesn't give me anything at all when the rank reset happens) and esxapes/kills count way more than having fun
---
I take your words serious. i will definetely try and do my best, because your are right. Ive never seen the problem in what i do with my drawings. I'll try as you said and draw things with my personal perspective :)
---
It is better for killers, but nothing has changed.  Still only like 3 viable killers at high ranks and the meta is super tight.  Dropping a pallet early is still a benefit to killers since it saves time.
---
You should just buy Leatherface. I honestly don’t see BBQ coming back into the Shrine for a long time.
---
Forget Freddy, just buff us.
---
Overreact exactly like this.  
---
It's adjustments, not nerfs. One left-over ability being removed (the re-stalk) that should've been removed already and therefore could count as a bug even.   
---
Better detection cause it's whonky af.
---
They weren't good survivors at all, they made mistakes after mistakes.
---
And this is part of the reason why I can't stand BHVR's balance philosophy. I don't understand why "hard" necessarily needs to mean "bad". The Nurse is hard to play too, but she's certainly not bad. No Mither should be the quintessential high risk high reward perk, with one massive downside balanced out by a handful of boosts to make the survivor better at doing everything they need to. That would make it difficult to use, and possibly disastrous if it goes wrong, but still worth running if you have the skill to pull it off.
---
Just buy leatherface
---
Nice dude! You play on PC right? We vould play a game some time?
---
I don’t wanna be rude but how are they so stupid? That Nea walked into the basement whilst she saw injured survivors run away besides her with the killer literally behind her.
---
This happens for me alot due to gamepass having the game now, the matchmaking is so piss poor so I constantly end up with newbies, if I can get them to, I hop into a KYF with them and show them the main strategies from both sides. My reward is the happiness I get when I see the messages saying thank you. It feels great.
---
If The Clown got shot, the bullets would bounce off the fat cunt's belly!
---
The plague is dead already so how would she be affected by the bullet?

All of them, my friend made a good point during a playthrough of dead space and I was stomping on alien guts.
---
There is no way we would be the same in that situation in real life.
---
It’s garbage on most killers except maybe Myers. I unlocked it on him and it seems to confuse survivors a lot. M&amp;A T2 Myers has an 8M terror radius when out of chase and a 24M one when in chase. At max stacks of Furtive he would have an 8M TR both in and out of chase, but it’s a lot of hassle trying to get there.
---
It's so counter-intuitive I can't understand the design behind it. It's weird as hell
---
This is the kind of quality stuff I look for. Can’t stop laughing!
---
It used to
---
No not piggy ffs.... the game is a mess right now.. oink...
---
That honestly seems redundent of them, does this count for bugfixes as well? Like I see no reason that they would need to do that besides maybe promoting people to have larger companies sponsering their game.
---
Thanks for the information though. I'll spread it around as often as I can if it turns out to be true to try and raise awareness of that tidbit.
---
It's a challenge perk, it's not meant to be something you would use to play optimally.
---
Based off your Emblem scores they still managed to do the gens quite quickly (which is why you only got bronze) and you also struggled in the Chaser Emblem for whatever reason, could have been you abandoned chases or lost survivors.
---
nothing
---
If anyone wants to use the format I made you can find it [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/SFAyeky) 
---
It’s not much but it’s honest work
---
Checked out Pharmacy. Seems the guy was talking out his ass nothing wrong with the perk. 
---
Perk functions like normal. Just Wake up &amp; vigil that is glitched for Quentin.
---
Sound so dumb lol. The reason ds activated is bc you were most likely tunnelled anyways so who tf cares if the killer gets butthurt when they were gonna tunnel u regardless
---
DS lasts for over 60 seconds I believe. Thats enough time for the survivor to run off and wait to be found again. It ain't tunnelling if you've been found again.
---
it doesn't count for hotfixes, but DBD as some messy code and they can't call those just "hotfixes". they have to change a lot of code to fix a little thing like this
---
That’s why I said most likely
---
You compared Iron Will with Spine Chill, but I'm not entirely sure why. They do completely different things. Spine Chill allows you to get away before the killer gets close, and Iron Will makes it more difficult for the killer to find you after they get close. Coming from someone who plays almost entirely killer, Iron Will is much more powerful than you give it credit for, although it doesn't do anything against the Doctor. Iron Will just makes you quieter, Calm Spirit makes it so you don't scream.
---
Exactly, it makes completely no sense to me... I was thinking about t3 Myers too or Huntress(her TR becomes 4m with max stacks and she doesn't hum in chases) but I have no idea how would that help me.. I mean, I can maybe juggle easier? But it's so situational...
---
Just have to play smarter, adjust your build and work on your weaknesses. May take time but if your patient you’ll have more fun in the long haul. Good luck. 👍
---
I am in asian region. DM me if it matches yours.
---
They’re clearly nerfs.
---
His most important addons that increase stalk speed are being objectively nerfed.  Don’t tell me “Oh his killer instinct is getting buffed so it’s fine.”  Having the ability to find survivors more easily is clearly not important to make a good killer and it’s definitely not what is most important to GF power.  Doctor has better detection and gets to keep his power to use it and he’s garbage.
---
The ability to restalk is very useful to make the time spent to stalk not wasted by getting pallet looped forever.  It doesn’t matter that it wasn’t intended for it to be a part of his power, it’s a useful ability that he has that’s being taken away completely.
---
If I lead you to Maurice in a chase and you don't pet him after brutally maiming me, *you are a monster*
---
DS should reset after each hook, not once per game.
---
Fair enough. Hopefully they're trying to untangle some of their *sphagett* code. Might even be what resulted in this patch
---
First thing i see after waking up. This already made my day
---
Exactly, it's quite complicated and all in all it doesn't give you anything. I really want to ask the person who designed it what the hell he/she was thinking? I mean, maybe there is some genius idea behind this and we just don't realise it...
---
I've played both sides, killer and survivor and when you use DS they go after you hard. When you play killer and get struck by it, it makes you lose your pateince with the game and you kinda just go with a   "fuck it" attitude for the rest of the game.
---
She was the first killer I ever learned to play :o my baby's getting a rework?! 
---
(I'm fine with it, just having some nostalgia hit me)
---
It does that anyway if you don't use it.
---
How did the son die? I should have asked that from the start.
---
Oh god oh no it's too late his self-esteem is tanking!
---
Car accident
---
I quite agree.
---
Legion is my second main after Pig, and I now find the point of him confusing. Am I supposed to hit them several times, or just once and rush to find others? If the former why have they made it so useless to do that? If the latter why the nonsensical addons? 
---
I'm like you, I liked him being FAST. But  now it just seems like you're supposed to use him as a base M1 killer.
---
you don't like that discussion any then because both sides are constantly bitching about the same things.
---
waa waa
---
DODGE THIS YOU BASTAAAAAAAAAAAAARD
---
Sir you are grossy exaggerating on him
---
Ok i get it more. Thanks.
---
I think this would be a great way to revitalize the game for anyone getting bored of it
---
You know what chief. You right. My personal opinion playing both is if killers can have bullshit perks it should be fine for survivors to have a good one here and there as well. That's the closest to balance this game can get considering a game like this theres no way to fully balance shit. Look at overwatch it's not even balanced
---
Equally there are games that are extremely unfun for survivors too. It works both ways, nobody can guarantee a fun time 100% of the time. Gen rushing is not a thing. It's their job.
---
u stoopid hehe
---
If you lose your patience bc of nerfed ds then your just a baby killer lmao why are you even going back to hook all the time instead of patrolling gens and you can always just slug too
---
Id actually think trapper could handle a bullet
---
It's kind of funny I had a video playing on my first monitor about a new Freddy build and while it was playing I was reading your comment I was listening to it. When I read that you said play with your food is bugged I was like "Hmm what is bugged with that" and as soon as I said the the video I was watching started explain what was bugged with it.
---
Also don't forget about furtive chase. It always makes the unhooker the obsession even if they aren't saying the obsession
---
I'm not an amazing Spirit player, but I picked her up a month or so ago and instantly loved her; she's my main now, and I've already improved a lot with her. So the memories of being in your place are still very fresh.
---
What helped me get better quick is watching Spirit gameplay videos, to be able to observe what her phasing does/looks like to Survivors without being under pressure myself. Guides of course are also great.
---
I've found that what works best for me is BBQ, Whispers, Surveillance and NOED. Yeah, NOED. Contrary to popular belief, it does not prevent you from getting better if you don't let it. I never understood that mindset anyway - it is ONLY active in the Endgame, so you're playing the entire game with only 3 perks. That's fucking challenging as a baby Killer. If you don't think of it as a crutch and try your best to get kills early on, I actually think it helps you improve since when you know you won't need it anymore to get 3ks/4ks, you can replace it and now have 4 perks instead of 3 during 80% of the trial's duration. Just make sure you're not relying on it and it's good to get more bloodpoints.
---
As for other Hex perks, I hate them. In general, just the possibility of having them cleansed early on... nah. I see the idea behind the Ruin/HG combo, but if Ruin is cleansed and HG ran out, you're down to 2 perks. And that can happen much quicker than you'd like.
---
Other perks I've tried are Brutal Strength with Enduring, which is kinda cool in the beginning but I've almost stopped breaking pallets. I either quickly phase after people or have them jump into my loving arms.
---
I might've fucked myself over with becoming reliant on add-ons increasing phasing speed, however. Don't get into a bad habit there, like they always say with the Nurse add-ons: Learn your power from muscle memory, or you'll have a hard time playing without your crutch add-ons. You can still use them, but make sure you don't always pick the same ones, Or make sure you always have enough of those, I guess.
---
Another console Nurse joins the ranks!
---
I haven't been ds'd once since they changed it, mostly cause I never tunnel and I'll usually leave you alone or just slug you if you were just on hook recently.
---
I didn't compare them I more or less just said I can use one or the other and that iron will has some positives spine chill can't provide but as I said I will be looking and I'm open to suggestions 
---
And spine chill has positives that ironwill can provide  
---
Also thanks I always get the doctor counter completly wrong between calm sprint and iron will
---
It sound as if he just finished masturbating but okay
---
I'm not going back to hooks because i run make yur choice. I try very hard to not find unhooked survivors but if they run in front of me I'll get the free hit
---
Pig should have her own category
---
I actually feel bad for them... they've got a lot of work to do.
---
Or Killers can be smart and not tunnel in the first place.
---
I must have really bad luck then tbh. Honestly I don't try to tunnel, because you don't win like that.
---
Btw pallet stun sound is the same
---
See like right now, you can’t think of anything so you don’t reply until you say something random and then never reply again, for no reason, if your trying to argue it’s best you don’t take weeks. :)
---
people like variety, doesnt make it good. I could run shit builds all day every day. doesnt make highlighting exit gates (of all things lol) any better of perk than it is. 
---
if you think looking at two lights and remembering them is photographic memory, you might need a simpler game to play.
---
Have you reported this bug yet? It'd also be great if you reported the other bug you described in your edit.
---
If anyone’s salty enough to send me a message on PS then I’ll remember them and mori them. Also if they use an exploit (like the wake up one) then I’ll just mori them if I see them in my lobby again
---
Granny chaser question mark
---
I don't tunnel because I don't hook patrol because i use a perk that requires me to be away from the hook. Legit I'll just find them and wack them because at the end of the day, a killers job is to kill survivors.
---
They haven't done that since Freddy.
---
Incoming "you think bbq and chili is op? Ha noob" comments
---
But I don't see why it needs to be. If you want a challenge build, just don't run perks and don't heal. No Mither could be a really cool and interesting perk if they just dropped the "challenge perk" mentality. The perk could still be challenging to use, but also actually havung a reason to use it other than trolling.
---
Especially in game that relies on cooperation, I don't see why gimping yourself is a playstyle that is actively encouraged. It's like BHVR is handing out invitations for people fuck over your teams.
---
And it still hurts
---
I think it should show the killers aura to the person being unhooked so it's beneficial in helping them avoid the killer like BBQ helps find survivors.
---
Title and ops comment explains - they're new to the game
---
I feel so bad for them, oh my god. I hope this didn't put them off of the game!
---
Legion just stabs you several dozen times. Stabs you then runs away to let you try to stop the bleeding before stabbing you again. Endless nonstop stabs.
---
Sadly I slugged a guy got another down went to the slug and got ds’d. That’s about the only moment i had where I wasn’t happy with that result. Other then that it was a good game and I believe I won.
---
A S C E N D
---
The only animals besides crows :(
---
I was thinking exactly this today. A bunch of my streamer buddies play killer just for the extra points. (Makes it hard to get a swf group lol)
---
Every killer can be viable at high ranks, because rank doesn't equal skill. As long as you know how to play your killer any killer can be viable, even clown.
---
For ps4 it was in shrine the same week as one of the new killer's releases. Spirit maybe? Nonetheless. The community says its bad and you should use better perks.
---
Ok thanks :)
---
Okay, imagine walking scared around the swamp and out of the sudden Hag jumps from the ground and eats you alive. I say a big NO.  
---
But your points are good as well. Doctor and Plague both look quite horrible to face. Especially Plague because I'm sympathize-vomiter and I hate vomitting...
---
reddit
---
2 guys was only onehook
---
The community says it's bad? Why's that? I've heard and seen that it's one of the most used perks for Killers.
---
is that a JoJo reference?
---
What is a Sonna?
---
I lost only one chase. This is why i am confused.
---
If you think there are only 3 viable red rank Killers, you need to adjust your approach.
---
Too many place too much importance on fast chases, without considering that there's a bottom limit. This limit exists due to differences in movement speed and hitbox size, the number and safety of pallet loops, etc.
---
E/SF only really significantly shortens 1 out of 3 pallet loops. Meanwhile, it encourages inefficient play. I've seen Tru3 spend too long chasing a single Survivor, to the detriment of gens, just to proc Spirit Fury.
---
Rather than trying to shorten chase to fit within the narrow time limit, gen-defence perks extend said time limit immensely.
---
Devs, there's a game in your bug.
---
You don't know where you should walk away to and you may end up walking into him ;)
---
Exactly but apparently it super easy to counter, just like ruin and every other killer perk bc killers are underpowered. 
---
 \_(-_-)_/
---
Clown can end chases very quickly, but has no map presence. Perk like Pop Goes the Weasel can really be helpful. Other perks that are good on Clown are, BBQ, Ruin, Brutal Strength, Enduring + Spirit Fury, nurses, Devour Hope, NOED, Overcharge, Bamboozle, Knock Out, Agitation, Iron Grasp, Spies From The Shadows, Thana, Sloppy Butcher, Save The best For Last, Discordance and a lot more.
---
If i remember someones name, it's ultimately because they're a cunt.
---
And cunts get killed first.
---
No.Just.No
---
:)
---
I mean. It's only counterable tho sorta by standing within the 40 meters? Other than that it's game on. And ya get bonus BP for hooking every survivor. Seems pretty good?
---
He's said that he wouldn't do this before yes. Within 2 matches he was already talking about balance the moment that things aren't going his way.
---
It just bugs me that he ends up trying to use "game balance" as the reason he's not doing well. I'd respect him more if he just owned up to his mistakes every once in a while.
---
i like this :)
---
They just need to fix the reveal. Staying right in front of Ghostface and getting exposed is not a good feeling
---
Otzdarva? :D   
---
I use PWYF on Plague and now I'm not sure if I can use it...  
---
BTW we can add thanatophobia to the list, it is bugged too.
---
I wouldn’t use Overcharge yes it’s a good perk and it might be able to catch a few people off guard but in red ranks people SHOULD be able to get that skillcheck. But pop is a definite yes for sure I love that perk.
---
Slugging is the better play if you can immediately start chasing another Survivor.
---
He can if there's no limitless pallets, but on some maps before you go through them all, since you've got no map pressure 4 gens has been popped.
---
I don't think you want to go arguing that you need equivalent perks for both sides lmao
---
That actually makes a lot of sense. I see what you're saying.
---
It's only when you puke at the end.
---
I agree, I hope they find a balance that’s consistent and fair for both sides
---
Don't puke at the end of trial, when the last survivor dies. It makes the game crash.
---
Not gonna lie the gens are crazy right now. I stopped playing for about 3 months and only just came back. I’ve never seen the gene go so fast.
---
Before if I lost a game it was due to stealthy survivors hiding well making me waste time looking for them, survivors getting to broken loops drastically extending chases etc, basically me making bad decisions and giving them too much free time.
---
Recently though it has been hook after hook after hook after hook. To the point that with the killer and map I’m giving I really don’t think I could play any better. The only increase would be to pick a killer with instadowns.
---
Something has definitely changed since earlier in the year. This is against survivors without wake up.
---
I really don't like slugging because its annoying for everyone. Like its 3 minutes of being in the floor and dying or you're back up in 30 seconds and the killer has to complete the chase again. There really isn't an ideal way to go around it. I tend to just spin around if I think they have it and sometimes they'll miss.
---
I would love to play against anyone but ghostface right now.. finding alot of toxic ghostface players and I guess the tea bagging was kinda funny at first but it's pretty annoying every game, considering I never tea bag killers as I play killer myself.
---
?
---
Yes, this is true hapiness
---
If I'm playing on this map, my girlfriend usually eggs me on to "got pet the good horse".
---
You can hide in a locker to completely counter it. Crouching down behind a gen in the drection of thje hook also sort of works.
---
&gt;The ability to restalk
---
Can at this point be considered a bug, something that should've gone with the increase of his timer from 20 to 45 seconds (more than doubled).
---
The changes are nothing that threatens the killer even remotely but this is reddit I guess...
---
Guess that's true.
---
I made a salty rant about a month ago about how (on ps4) the killers are insanely op and they kept nerfing the survs. 
---
I said the most commonly used perks for killers are
---
 sloppy butcher, ruin, the one for miss recovery (unrelenting?), and bbq.
---
I was met by a ton of killer mains that gave me plenty of angry tips for bbq like "stand near a gen" or "use the adam perk" or "hide under his nose". I try these and still get found so idk.
---
He’s way op right now, covers too much distance for too long
---
&gt;It's actually my sonna and my friends sonna! (I'm with Ghostface, ahaha!)
---
But it's completely logical that good swf are all in red rank. 
---
So it's completely logical to lose against them since they are not and shouldn't be part of balance.
---
At least as long as devs refuse to specifically nerf swf with less perk slots regarding the number or player in the premade.
---
Ghost face is mid tier so good enough to fight a good solo team.
---
It's still a great fucking perk. I use it on literally every killer I have because I want bloodpoints.
---
What are you even trying to say? Lmfao, no offense man but be more specific.
---
So why did they changed this? For me its the second worst killer perk in the game, number 1 is The Huntress thing that removes stain when your under effect of Bloodlust
---
Ah ok that makes sense, so they managed to raise the money by not making any profit themselves. Thanks for sharing (I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this comment anyway)
---
Don't listen to these people. BBQ has NO downsides whatsoever, unless you count "not having a different perk" as a downside.
---
You get more BP and you get intel whenever you hook people. It's great and i've gotten more than one down from having it
---
He's not calling everyone toxic, he just points out that in higher ranks most killers can't so shit unless survivors fck up and he is actually right ;)   
---
My advice for you: If you can't watch him don't watch him :) Good luck!
---
i think it's still meta 'cause either you force the killer to spread his attention on different players, or you stun him for 5 fucking seconds.
---
It's a great perk and it's still meta.
---
No u
---
No, it shouldn't. Use your perks wisely.
---
I wasted about 6 gateaus and the game crashed each time, I cried about it on Vince stream and he told me to verify the integrity of game files (he had the same problem), I did it and it actually helped, not a single crash since then.
---
Try Mad Grit. Devs aren't gonna change hook blocking anytime soon so that's one of your best options.
---
Winning is fun. Losing isn't.
---
Happened to me too, couldn’t heal and went beyond the gates.
---
If you go beyond the gates then run into the void as it will teleport you back to the map. Then try the other exit if possible. I got lucky and it put me right next to an open hatch but from what I’ve seen this isn’t guarenteed.
---
A Werewolf would be cool!
---
I've got a question. Is there a perk in this patch that is not bugged?
---
mad grit + agitation is nasty vs SWF groups
---
Because gen rushing is a think and I don’t think I have ever seen hook rushing and if it is a thing then hook rushing is the counter-able one because survivors can loop and avoid killers constantly while killers can’t defend gens unless they play 3 killers that’s why hook rushing isn’t said as it isn’t a thing. :)
---
lerys and coldwind are the worst as nurse
---
Cause there's 4 of us and 1 of them yet only they have a "super power" and we don't so it is like a lion picking off gazelles and then the lion complaining that it wasn't good enough lol
---
It can also depend on which Killer you were playing. You get more points in Chaser for hitting Survivors multiple times and ending the chase quickly. The longer the chase the less points and if you play an insta-down Killer you lose out because you’re not getting multiple hit scores
---
Thank you, very cool.
---
Its the one bloodpoint perk. It needs to be balanced. Killer mains probably don’t realize it, but survivors don’t get shit for bloodpoints unless they get stacks with ‘We’re gonna live forever’. 
---
SOOO.... survivors have to choose... do I want 4 perks, or do I want to be at a disadvantage but get DECENT bloodpoints.
---
trapper is based of jason right? do you think he has the same durability as him?
---
Tunnel = hookrush
---
I don't think perks should necessarily be equivalent of each other, but it is kinda bs that survivors have to sacrifice a perk slot just to improve their horrible bp gain.
---
Exactly!
---
Quenting got buffed too much and all we want is buffing his face...
---
So you fuck someone?
---
Yes it was Otzdarva. I was playing plague and just after a really good 4k my game crashed right before getting my bloodpoints. Then I saw you said plague crash bug so I guess I can't play her now D:
---
**\[happy oink\]**
---
He has just too much style.  
---
I thought Legion with his "Sliding over pallets" was cool, but Ghostface takes style to a whole other level.
---
I don’t want to sound biased because I do play both sides fairly evenly, and body blocking can be frustrating but the same question applies....  Why can killers face camp and pull survivors from unhooking? 
---
From what I’ve noticed, yes survivors like to take hits for their teammates because if they’re almost free off their shoulder it’s nice help, because why would wiggling exist?   But most times when survivors body block is because the killer most likely tunneled and that team helps them-  that’s the only time I’ll body block the hook.    
---
Once you realize just snack them, they’ll run away.   Plague’s perk where survivors scream once you down a survivor is great to avoid such a thing.
---
Genrushing is just a stupid excuse when killers get outplayed
---
Wake up, Vigil, Sprint Burst, Remember me, Play with your food, Thanatophobia, Furtive Chase... Anything else?
---
There's a nice patch in this bug.
---
He's been shot multiple times in the movies, also he got burned and suffered many more injuries wich would have killed a normal human being. I think a single shot wouldn't kill him, considering he even survived a shot through the eye.
---
No problem dude :)
---
Thanks, he seems like a really nice guy but this crying about everything is so damn annoying. He needs a break from this game I guess
---
Edited it, got the sources now, what we got for the anniversaries.
---
You can play her, just don't puke at the end of a trial \^\_\^
---
Answering irony with irony is idiotic.
---
True. I chose to include her mostly because her traps should in theory kill you. Evan's traps are mostly avoidable and don't technically kill you either but in theory they help him injure survivors and allow him to just like pick them up.
---
But yea, I agree
---
Nea finally using that agility right
---
dat boi is hella hyped for party
---
If you handle body-blocking well, the survivors end up harming themselves. If you drop the survivor and slug, you will probably get value out of body-blocking.  
---
I don't think there should be a change to body-blocking, as it makes for one of this game's core mechanics. Moreover, if you try making things seem logical, this game becomes much different; Bubba's and Hillbilly's chainsaws would kill you, and survivors falling from high places would either die or break their legs, for example.
---
Back then, I don't think people considered Groaning Storehouse to be a reward, tbh.
---
People suggested that a long time ago
---
the reason you run no mither is to START THE GAME INJURED without killer's help.
---
Yeah but not her.
---
In short we either are sweet to each other or we fight. Friends say we're like a married couple and I just started calling her wife from that. Then became back and forth
---
I'd say this is a fair point, gen-rushed is just referring to the survivor doing the objective.
---
He is, it’s just the complaining got old after a while as he kept complaining more and more over time. He really does just needs a break.
---
I think it's quite sophisticated \^\_\^  
---
But really, use Lithe for vault without a drop or combine it with BL, or just use BL.
---
Uncalled for.
---
and this is why i don't like this subreddit whine instead of memes
---
The same people that complain about hillbillies and nurses all the time are the people who got freddy nerfed.
---
Wait, what's the solidarity bug?
---
Nice. Yea, it's not easy. I get a good chase like every 10th match.
---
There's a lot of stuff in this game that makes no sense. Bodyblocking is a high risk strategy, learn to play against it.
---
Do you pc guys really get a lot of like, really good nurses (not shit, or decent nurses)? It seems really hard to actually be a good nurse, and I dont see a lot of high rank survivor dbd content creators go against that many nurses
---
how the hell did you do legion achievement thats almost imposible with randoms becouse you need so much luck
---
WGLF, BBQ, lullaby, anything that can hold 4 or more stacks really
---
They changed it so that it doesn't get combined with stbfl and allow you to just nail survivors left and right. I think an easy fix would have been to just make them unstackable or something
---
Both perks requires the main objective. Killers are to hook. Survivors are to save  (technically do gens but a good killer can make you not do a gen so I see why it’s protection and safe unhooks) 
---
But bbq is a beautiful two in one perk. So many bloodpoints! And aura reading which is so helpful.  
---
I agree, WGLF should have a passive perk with if. Aura reading, maybe a haste for 30 seconds???
---
I honestly don't know whether to laugh or be horrified.
---
"You can shoot but you can't kill, bitch!"
---
I had 2 crashes in a row yesterday with the exact same szenario.
---
I was playing Plague, and both time someone used a key on the hatch while I was mid-puke. Apparently those 2 animations combined make my game crash instantly :(
---
Luckily I got that before Legion rework, but still you are absolutely right it needs hell of a lot of luck. Dirt addon and longer frenzy was my friend.
---
I absolutely love this you did an amazing job!
---
hahaha is mostly what I understood
---
I DON'T GET IT, I'M SWITCHING BACK TO PC AFTER SPENDING MORE THAN 1K HOURS ON PS4 &amp; WAS GOING TO USE THIS EVENT TO GET A BOOST TO RELEVELING FOR TEACHABLES. GOT 5 CAKES ON JAKE BEFORE LEVEL 25, BUT ONLY 3 ON DWIGHT BEFORE LEVEL 40. IT'S A BIT OBNOXIOUS.
---
If can't combine the Haste affect gained from Lithe with Balanced Landing. If preform a rushed vault from a high place and you have Lithe and Balanced Landing equipped, than Lithe will still be wasted and now you cannot use Balanced Landing's Haste affect.
---
BHVR reinstituted the healing cancel option via moving just because of Sprint Burst, it isn't a stretch that they could at this feature in the help Lithe and maybe at interesting plays for other 150% Haste perks.
---
Exactly how does it promote tunneling when you have to be tunneled for the perk to activate 😭😭
---
Also it's apparently bugged. I met a super toxic SWF last night on my baby billy (I suck at him). There were to left, the gates were open and one literally bodyblocks the hook and breaks my killer. I now float, unable to do anything (attack, move) for 6-8 seconds. I'm frantically trying to hook this guy and I get broken AGAIN.
---
These guys knew how to break the game and abused it twice.
---
bUt MaKiNg OtHeR's ExPeRiEnCe MiSeRaBlE iS fUn!
---
There was also a time where they were unstackable. At that point, they had to perks that did literally the same thing and decided to just rework unrelenting into something else.
---
Plague can be real good against looping as you generally have to hit them with M1 only once.
---
Moreover, Survs are always in catch 22 over cleansing themselves or not.
---
I assume it means "Persona" or their own character based off of them, OP previously said its an OC/self insert of OP and their friend.
---
Dude is stoned to the bone!
---
Oh true, but it's only visual bug
---
Hook rushing, or tunneling, is also considered the killer's objective. However, tunneling is usually at the detriment of a single survivor's enjoyment that match. They will be out fast, with little BP. A killer player can't be thrown out early because of genrushing. This is a thing that's been going on for ages, and frankly, I'm over it. BHVR has given both sides plenty of perks to counter genrushing and tunneling in the last year.
---
Gen rushing is indeed a stupid excuse. Hook rushing is actually a complaint though, it's called tunneling and people complain about it a lot.
---
still a bug tho.
---
also, legion's double blade exploit is back and now it's worse
---
The bloodwarden was nice
---
That explains it. I always puke and spin in circles at the end
---
Agreed but "Outplayed"? By what, holding m1? Losing ruin because it spawned next to someone?
---
Imagine using wake up because it’s bugged lol. Seriously if you use bugged wake up your dead to me.
---
All things considered most probably had bolt action rifles since they were WW1 soldiers.
---
i'm honestly surprised just how many things the devs broke with this update and i don't even know how they broke it. hopefully the hotfix that is coming will fix this stuff
---
There were guys in almost every car
---
Hatchet's hitbox is just a massive ball. They did made hitbox that actually fit the model but SOMEHOW hatchets started just flying through survivors and not registering hits which was shown on many video. Apparently the problem is survivor's hitbox but how can you fuck up such a (simple hitbox)\[ [https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/778473430445952784/31A47F51ADBE7872893A38A12AC891C453FF2197/?imw=1024&amp;imh=576&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=true](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/778473430445952784/31A47F51ADBE7872893A38A12AC891C453FF2197/?imw=1024&amp;imh=576&amp;ima=fit&amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;letterbox=true) \]

You used it too early
---
Yea, I know, I had to deal with it once...
---
Me too :D The puke of victory
---
You can use him but he's not the best. He suffers from lack of map pressure so generators are going to pop like crazy. I'd say you can do fine against randoms, but against swf you'll have a hard time
---
I *Have* to
---
Yeah no point in complaining, just laugh it off. Not like there wont be more medkits and instaheals
---
ur welcome
---
I agree with Michaels position, but he did get shot in the movies and fucked right off...
---
It's a simple map, nothing to crazy, but still something compared to nothing.
---
Lvling leatherface: Nawwwww  
---
Getting it from shrine: Aww hell yeah   
---
(haven't played in forever so no idea when the last stuff for LF was in Shrine or how it even works now, if it works differently)
---
It’s a ghostface killa meme, he is op.
---
First rule of Survival: Learn the controls
---
Yes. Speaking from my experience (I am a killer main but I've played a lot of survivor in red ranks recently)  
---
you get arround 40% nurse, 40% billy, 20% spirit or something like that.  
---
And usually they know what they are doing.  
---
That's not bad because survivors know how to play here aswell but it's still pretty annoying if you want to play survivor for like 3-5h straight and you end up facing: Nurse, Nurse, Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Billy, Nurse, Nurse, Billy ... and so on :/
---
David king has 2 great perks for survivor. Dead hard is probably the best exhaust perk and WGLF is great for bp
---
point at the horse
---
Tbh it's annoying but I understand. I play in high ranks mostly weak killers (I find weak killers more fun and strong killers pretty unfun) and playing against good survivors is usually a hard and rough experience. I actually love going against nurses but not soo much billys
---
If you read the rules maybe you would know
---
Is it just me, or does the Plag have an extra arm or leg?
---
I love using Wake Up. I love it for end game. I love it since the new EGC.  And I’m so annoyed with this bug because I want to keep using it... but fuck do I find it unfair for killers. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, the bug is awesome. It just shouldn’t be that way. 
---
I was actually using it for awhile, I guess when the bug first got addressed but in the last day or so I JUST found out about it.  So I’ve probably been a dick lately and I don’t wanna be THAT girl. 
---
They need to hurry up and fix it bc it’s such a clutch end game.
---
The reason why they changed it is because it made for a stupidly strong combo with Save The Best For Last, commonly referred to as a [machine gun killer](https://youtu.be/G8PBH3wd2OU). It's a shame it got nerfed the way it did. I would have loved to see it be a weaker stbfl you didn't have to work for that's just not compatible with what we have today.
---
Yeah or some spirits
---
Yes officer this post right here
---
Right??? How do you just all of a sudden buff/break the absolute shit out of an underrated perk? How does that even happen lol
---
Y'all need to relax. Lol
---
Honestly got a good chuckle out of that. The eternal FLEX.
---
\*boob3 intensifies\*
---
But I mean, you didnt really survive that though, so it qouldnt make sense. I really want wiggle points even if you dont wiggle out, but it wouldnt make sense to be in any category
---
&gt; The changes are nothing that threatens the killer even remotely but this is reddit I guess... 
---
I mean I see where you are coming from with the: It wasn't intended - argument.  
---
But saying that this isn't a huge nerf is just objectivly false.
---
Whats the bug? Not played this game in a while.
---
I saw him last month at a con. That picture is outdated. He had a full head of grey and looked a bit closer to his age. But still looked good for his age.
---
Why was this downvoted? He's just telling the OP they're missing one of the killers.
---
I think you need to look up what objectivly means.
---
true but ghostface has a cooler mask
---
I know what it means.  
---
I think you're pretty entitled to your wrong opinion, though.  
---
But that's okay.  
---
I'll leave it here.
---
I’ve had a couple of healing bugs recently. All involving not being able to heal others, or others not being able to heal me so I have to self care.
---
I play against real jerks as killers on PS4. You know, the ones who were absolute terrible (getting tunneled so hard I walk out with 1k bpoints) or literal face camped. I remember them and dodge or play like a try hard (my try hard build is DS and Balanced Landing while putting on haddonfield LMAO)   Maybe I’m the jerk? But anyways. 
---
But when I play killer, I don’t have the energy to remember survivors who teabag (personally don’t find it frustrating) but my favorite is when I’ve had those shitty killers and they end up in my lobby!  I’m busting out that Mori!! 
---
When it comes to the wake up bug, I can’t assume they’re using knowing it’s a bug:exploit. It hasn’t been addressed and only on reddit.  A lot of gamers don’t check this.
---
It's not useless as any good killer. It shows you the next target or if someone's close. I play spirit and there are only two maps that make it almost useless. The game and lery's. But I always run it for those bloodpoints.
---
Our goal was to collect the time, we will cross the next bridge when I get there   : ^)
---
Removing the ability to stalk exposed survivors is a huge nerf. If it weren’t for that, his power would be pretty useless at rank 1. I haven’t gone down within 45 seconds against any GF yet, all the 1 shots were due to them adding time by restalking. I’ve bullied so many GFs that I’ve lost count. As long as you pay attention to your surroundings, he’s just an M1 killer that likes to t-bag.
---
The day I lose a match to a nurse on the PS4 is the day I’m retiring from this game.
---

Nothing wrong with noed
---
it was borrowed time, guess now i'll chase after the unhooker
---
Gens are already done too fast.
---
This has to be a troll post
---
BRUH. I swear on everything that is holy, that is fucking genius. I Havin seen a loss meme is ages.
---
I'd like to see Ghostface as the 12th DLC
---
with many counters to the aura reading, you can't even estimate who's close anymore. you only see those who are on the other side of the map and outside lockers, which gets more and more rare the higher rank you are
---
good job but you kinda wasted sprint burst when you got hit because you dropped a pallet and you wasted 75% of sprint burst
---
i would also recomend to look behind every 2 seconds or so it helps to calculate wheter you get hit if you vault the window or drop the pallet
---
Besides the bugfest dbd is now and some broken maps, the game is pretty balanced now
---
MOOOOOOOOOM DONT PULL THE PLUG
---
He's a popular streamer. That's why.
---
He told about combining them. do you even read?
---
If survivors complain about tunneling you can say they tunneled your gens.
---
Thanks for your opinion. &lt;3 (no homo)
---
imagine being entitled over a skin right now, i swear these players sometimes 🤦‍♀️
---
I love playing against a good 4 man SWF team. It's a challenge and I love it
---
No. I'm on Reddit. I was told reading is inevitable
---
Thanks for the tip. I’ll buy Leatherface and just try to get to 35, maybe 40 as quickly as possible.
---
True, but on the other hand this is the thing I hate about Billy. Currently he's the 3rd strongest Killer (1st being Nurse, 2nd Spirit, 4th Huntress). However he doesn't have any high skill-requierement at all. Sure there are some niche-tricks you can do once you're good at it but with 115% base ms, an abillity that allows permanent roaming and a one-shot with an absurdely dumb hitbox once in close-range...You don't need to be good at Billy to have success but simply understand Killer-basics like decision-making, when to attempt mindgames and when not to etc. If you got those basics up you don't even need to be "good" at Billy to have ATLEAST decent success with him. And that's what actually bother me about him. Billy's the only Killer within the top 4 that actually lacks skill-requierement in contrast to his potential powers.
---
Inb4 killer has NOED.
---
I'm repeating myself here probably: adjustments, not nerfs.
---
They take away the refill which should've never made it in to begin with. All of the hotfix stuff should've been in on release but they couldn't make it.
---
When your job is a streamer and you use that platform to voice your opinion. People are entitled to disagree with your opinion. 
---
Nothing wrong with it.
---
nurse, Billy, Huntress and spirit are the only killers that benefit from the aura reading because they're able to get there fast/throw a hatchet. the only reason it's used so much is because of the bp bonus. without the 2x bp most m1 killers wouldn't use it. there are better tracking/aura reading perks like discordance, whispers.
---
When I'm playing killer yeah they are. When I'm playing survivor I can't do gens. Killer somehow always finds me first and chases me till I'm on a hook. Then I get unhooked and go heal hoping he's found someone else to chase. I'll get my bar to like 90% and that's right when the killer always happens to find me and throw me back on the hook. And after that he just returns to the hook as soon as I'm unhooked since I'm dead on hook at that point. This shit happens every game so I never get any points in the objective category
---
It would seem we have met xD
---
And I'd let you do it again, if I saw you there
---
Green key with no add ons incoming in 5...
---
Das clownery luv, x
---
That's really bad. I've seen him attack fans a few times. 
---
Dude we pay your bills you ungrateful little scrub
---
:(
---
It was a party starter.
---
killers need to learn when to leave a survivor because they're looping a strong tile. they have to be able to down survivors quickly, break pallets (only if needed) and from which side. a lot of killers don't really know how to apply pressure.
---
Imo, the other list is pretty close to how i feel. Other than Huntress, and Hag need to swap.
---
Huntress hunts and kills for sport, kidnaps little girls, and lets them die of starvation in her home. (regardless if she has the intelligence of a child, she must know in some form, what shes doing is horribly wrong)
---
The Hag, was merely an innocent girl, minding her own business until she was abducted by the cannibals. Her death was so tragic that the Entity, allowed her to reap vengeance. AFAIK, she never hurt an innocent, until the trials.
---
Michael's is more of a grunt to me. It's like an exasperated moan. Like a sad cow. I definitely wouldn't put him on the same respiratory level as Clown and Nurse.
---
Because that's how it works on PC?
---
Dang boi
---
Yeah but surely you must know from the tutorial and the fact that they know its a killer vs survivor you wouldn’t stand right next to a killer and do nothing about it?
---
you 'float' in front of a hook if there's a survivor in front of you or they broke the hook a second before you're able to hook them. its annoying but you should just enjoy those free hits or slug them if needed.
---
I'm just exclusively playing omegablink until it's fixed and taking note if everyone who has it so in the future I can instasaw them :^)
---
I have no life and I taught bbq and surveillance in a day n a half lol. I believe in you.  
---
It’s weird, once you have bbq on your favorite killers, you’re gonna wonder what you were doing before it lol.   Especially during bloodhunt weekends holy moly it’s wonderful.
---
If you only shot Ghostface once he wouldn't die, they always get back up
---
Nope. NOED is still in the game and killers use it. Fuck them.
---
I'm agreeing with you....
---
New survivor item: glock
---
bitch how tf do I know what chapter it currently is i dont follow the roadmap
---
yeah xD
---
Then when you down someone who was recently unhooked, take a few moments before picking them up.
---
This game needs to be entirely rebuilt from the ground up. Any time they add literally anything to the game it breaks other shit that shouldnt even be remotely affected. They need to stop creating more content and just fix the game. Or at least create the content for a fixed game and essentially re release the game after 6 months to a year with a phat content release alongside the revamped system.
---
Get good &lt;3
---
I very quickly remade the meme I thought was pretty funny by  u/DarkTree69
---
All meme credit goes to them, just thought it was a great post
---
I want Jason though I know it's not going to happen.
---
We just need him to finish the most well known slasher party
---
Who do you play as killer? Also what do you consider to be "high ranks"?
---
If it takes you 2 minutes to find 1 survivor.... like what are you even doing? Walking in circles looking for scratch marks lol. 
---
I play Hag, and she takes a moment or two to setup her trap web. I fully understand a good SWF can gen rush, but I haven't made it to EGC without 2 hooks, and i waste 30-60 seconds at the start of a game easy.
---
That has been like that for ages
---
SLIGHTLY they are nefred SLIGHTLY! SLIIIIGHTLY. Stop overreacting. Jesus Christ.
---
Also you have 45s to down a survivor. If that is not enough for you then maybe learn to loop better.
---
Even Freddy, Leatherface and Trapper all can work in high ranks. It might be harder but they work
---
Michael only targets people who have a chance at defending themselves. That's why you never see him attacking little kids. Definitely a bit of "more reward for the hunt" type of incentive behind his thought process.
---
The young teenager he killed in the car may have unfortunately been a wrong place at the wrong time sort of situation.  He needed to steal that car, but he also didn't want to leave any tangible witnesses alive.
---
In terms of the killers we got, Clown is VERY evil and has no limitations with who he attacks. And he tortures his victims which just puts him on another level of psychopath, in my opinion. Michael kills to kills, because death intrigues him, but Clown kills for his own sick, sexual purposes.

---
Right that's 4 perks just for an unhook. Survivors also have to do gens, get chased, tunneled, and camped. And try to get out alive.
---
its a mobile game, have you seen a mobile game above $10???
---
I think Trapper and Huntress would probably walk it off too.
---
God forbid they make it so we cant stack two perks. I guess if they tried to do that it would just shatter the spaghetti code and all these killers will be released into the world and I dont think we need anymore monsters like Nea running around.
---
Why does everything need to be viable? Why can't things exist just for fun
---
No it hasnt, they turn their entire upper half now and its part of the new update.
---
The reality is that whether you are a killer main or a survivor main, there is no game without each other. Just as there's no light without darkness, we need each other to exist.
---
Do what? Have they got something planned?
---
This is art
---
That blood warden, though. All hope is lost, Jake.
---
I play nurse on console and most games I destroy. Platform makes a difference but you shouldn't let it hold you back
---
I agree the clown is super fucked up lmao. But I definitely wouldn’t put em over Freddy. And you guys got me thinking about Myers being 2nd or 3rd lmao
---
Rank 17. Explains it all. Your not good nor does your opinion mean much until your at least yellow ranks.
---
Hey man that perk can be useful if you're absolutely shit at mindgames and just chase in a straight line forever. For real though it's kinda nice for mind games on console since we cant really do the 180 spins to hide our red stain until we are upon them.
---
Spirit was just a teenager the victim of her fathet's mental breakdown. It's implied she never killed anyone (whether she reaped revenge on her father after becoming the spirit is not stated, but even so, sam reasoning as wraith)
---
I'd say spirit is the least evil.
---
Errmmm... no.
---
You need to break 2 pallets to be able to proc SF. Once people know you've got the perk, they drop pallets pallets early. That's 3 different pallet loops to get one E/SF hit.
---
Using midgames for a hit/stun trade lets you get a hit after ONE pallet loop. You can do this while running E/SF, but then you a making the combo a bit pointless.
---
In my experience, I've never needed it.
---
I bet it's because people with bright neon know and want to be seen
---
And here we go with people overreacting about his nerf with us mostly just bug fixes, a buff and a nerf do minor you won't even notice it
---
Or you can tunnel with a Mori! Think you can use your decisive strike? How about I decisively strike you with my Mori!?
---
True. I’m guessing the entity took her after the incident?
---
Back then, there was a near-infinite loop in the main building. They have since removed that loop.
---
&gt; I've had many, many others where I've actually had to DC because the bugs were so bad
---
Totally man, you never said every game is buggy.
---
I think that's fair.
---
Gen rush should only be used when people dont heal or save and just stay on gens ignoring their team at least in my opinion.
---
At one point yes
---
It means that If the survivors pop all gens fast and escape then the killer was outplayed, because the survivors played in a way that overwhelmed the killer. The killer lacked appropriate pressure to stop survivors doing their objective. That's the point. 
---
Map pressure is a part of this. But overall pressure is what they're referring to here. The killer was outplayed because they failed their main objective. It's not about winning or losing chases.
---
A red rank legion? Is that even possible lol
---
Wait nvm, yeah it is, Legion is hella bugged, and is being abused by tons to make it to red ranks.
---
Get the fuck off this sub.
---
No it isnt. Killers are blaming survivors for doing their main objective. I mean killers who say that they lost because of genrush are completely braindead. Survivors want to escape, they do gens. Wtf are they supposed to do? Do gens slower to give killer more time to kill?
---
This is awesome.
---
My favourite are Shattered Bloodline, Demise of Faithul, Of flesh and mud and The Saw probably :)
---
Never got into Deathgarden because the characters just feel boring.
---
I do like some of the powers, like a mine or turret in DBD is cool.
---
It's a cycle. Every game like DBD just ends up dying. Friday, Last Year, Garden.
---
I’ve been saying Vampire forever!! I would love a beautiful vampire. Absolutely gorgeous but scary abilities.   Only thing I want (besides chucky of course; but that’s a pipe dream)
---
The only thing is new is you can now turn your head with the camera during actions you couldn't before, for example, repairing a gen, healing, etc. Everything else is just like always.
---
Though Trapper and Hillbilly are loosely based on Jason and Leatherface.
---
Whats coming out of their mouths...
---
Wrong Freddy
---
So what? If you don't like him, don't watch him... What is this bitching about?  
---
At least he doesn't exploit like some other streamers ;)
---
If adrenaline bothers you so much use noed. I’m a killer main but usually punish them with thanatophobia and try to stall for as long as I can.
---
Many times I just stood next to it the entire game thanks for reminding me
---
About as dumb as bitching about tunneling.
---
Diabetes can be pretty rough stuff.
---
I mean I've watched him for awhile (mostly because my friend has sent me his videos) I only recently started playing and I gotta say the shit he's been complaining about for years is still an issue. So as someone who had been gaming for most of his life and seeing the same issues never get fixed it isnt surprising at all how burnt out he seems. It's not even whining essentially but it's just him going oh look this is STILL broken and I'm still getting fucked out of kills and an enjoyable experience because of the same shit I've talked about since the game came out.
---
Tampon strings bro.
---
then a demon or shadow monster aren't human, demons weren't or aren't human, it would need to be a human based killer similar to a Knight I suggested.
---
It doesn't matter. The nerfs are going to end up so damn minor you won't ever even notice them in a game Realsticly.
---
So yes, I can and will say they don't matter
---
because they don't.
---
I respect you for not throwing down god pallet
---
Just like the brain that thought up the post &lt;3
---
A lot of people seem to disagree.
---
Who says it couldn’t be the first killer that isn’t human?
---
Maurice is the best character in the game.
---
But it sucks doesn’t it how you can’t use it to it’s potential because of how blatant it is that you have it? I get why you run it like I’ve been playing this game since 2017, it was just an idea I had this morning
---
You must have a really boring life if you;re forced to watch streamers you don't like :)
---
Left behind, it's so useless it can't be worse than it is
---
JoJo and dbd? You have my upvote
---
White cigarettes
---
Couldn't you just lean back and forth at the cracks to prevent them from breaking you out? 
---
I've been stalked a few times while in killer shacks, starting to think this has been how lol.
---
He is not.
---
I think survival should include anything that is an attempt to survive. Just doesnt make sense that there are things you can do that are legitimate features in the game and you're not rewarded for it.
---
Close. He can only mori them while they are standing up, not while they are on the ground. It's a unique feature to Myers with tombstone. He has to walk into regular m1 range, and a prompt comes up (M1 kill).
---
Leatherface is fun to use and be against. He’s one of the killers where maps don’t really matter (the only ones who do are Michael and Ghostyboi with corn).
---
That explains it then. The Nurse is a nightmare on pc.
---
True I ran a cross a fucking good nurse who didn't have ruin she murdered all of us within 4 minutes of the match
---
How can you "hear" text smart boi
---
Well, I feel like they should change it to where the healing action should be sped up, but give more skill checks, or whenever you are doing a gen, it should only give more skill checks. Because this would help more perks to be used like Stake Out, because whenever I use it I never get any skill checks to use the tokens. It would also buff Autodidact because whenever I use it I never get a skill check to get the tokens.
---
TBH even if it was straight decrease it's kinda useless but yea, maybe it would be worth a try...
---
But how is it a perk then really? I thought perks were designed to in some way benefit the character your playing as when it really only has negative implications
---
bro i got rank 1 with 40 hours when i first bought the game, don't give it too much thought, and only the blades are bugged which im not using
---
Those gens must be Claudettes hiding from me
---
i'm a simple man. i see reviewbrah, i upvote
---
also because this meme is good
---
Freddy is a literal Dream Demon. (was human before death)
---
Rin, a poltergeist basically. (was human before death)
---
The Wraith, clearly isn't human anymore. (was human before disappearance)
---
The Nurse, im not even sure what to call her lol. (was human before death)
---
The hag, a blood thirsty monster? (was human before death)
---
The Plag, closer to being a true human, tho she is more of a disease in human form. (was human before death)
---
All of them started as humans, but what some of them are now... is the furthest you can get from being human being. There is no cannon or lore preventing the use of monsters, or demons. All that matters is they start as a human, the Entity can do the rest.
---
bruh relatable 🗿
---
The new Freddy buff looks sick
---
Spirit is genuinely fun for both sides imo. Same for Myers. Wraith can be fun depending on add ons. Huntress is fun as long as she doesn't have insta downs.
---
The only killers who don't care about maps are Nurse and Spirit.  
---
Leatherface can't use his power on any map that includes windows/pallets.
---
Wait, what outfit is the one with the hat?
---
No way, do they actually?
---
How about a Child's play chapter with Andy as a survivor and Chucky as the killer
---
Lmao
---
hint the name "the shape"
---
the hag because urban evasion means she sucks, not like she already sucked already but i still find the hag fun to play and getting jumped by her traps gives me a good laugh.
---
Also the nurse because she’s a good challenge unless shes a god and can omae o wa mo shinderu me, in which case the match only lasts 2 seconds.
---
I also like going against the spirit because she keeps you on your toes w/ map control.
---
The kid complaining on the first clip shouldn't have gotten a reveal anyway TBH.
---
Spotted the Billy-player I suppose?
---
Mindgaming is a Killer-basic and nothing that has to do with him in particular. Just because you mindgame with a chainsaw instead of M1 it's not a specific mechanic. Hitting curves around loops is more or less common sense. Pig's attempt that often enough aswell, you don't have to be a genius to have this idea. And backrevving ain't consistent enough to be called an essential mechanic in my opinion.
---
As I already said, I don't say that Billy has literally no skill-requierement. It's just pretty low when it comes up to how much is needed to have atleast decent to good success. And this is simply due to his base-stats being too high in comparasion to what his abillity is capable of. A Killer with one-shot and high mobillity just shouldn't have 115% ms. Or rather more, if they want to keep Billy like this, they better adjust the other Killers. I don't see a reason why Hag runs around at 110% ms when Billy has even more.
---
You don't need fancy backrev's or any cheap anti-loop attempts to have success with Billy. Not at all to be fair. And this was the very core of my primal comment. This post is more or less about how Nurse sets the standart for what's fine balance-wise and what isn't. Simply due to her being so broken but still have a pretty big skill-requierement. 
---
And when it comes up to the person I answered also that the best Killers should have atleast a certain minimum of skill to be requiered for the Killer itself to properly work.
---
Billy however is different on that regard. You've to be pretty good as Nurse, Spirit and Huntress to get relatively frequently atleast 3 sacrifices. When it comes up to Billy you've to know how to play Killer but not how to play Billy. That's the very difference.
---
Nurse has actually much more "skill-expression" than many people think. But that's simply because Nurse is too abusive in terms of short blinks. Also the very "feature" that bothers me the most about Nurse. Shortblinking is much too easy and lacks counterplay. Just like insta-saw Billy. A Nurse that blinks onto you just to tap M2 and get a free-hit ain't a good Nurse but simply abuses her. You'll feel the difference when playing against a REALLY good Nurse and someone who does nothing but short-blinks.
---
I honestly like the Stalkers. Myers and GF. Its fun trying to avoid LOS and trying to spot them before they spot me.
---
Spirit is close 3rd. The jump scares she brings to the table, and i'm always alert waiting to get gen grabbed.
---
Imagine comparing a bugged perk that actually makes a match unwinnable for killers to a perk that’s pretty powerful yes, but has a counter and doesn’t guarantee a win
---
It'a perk to challange yourself.
---
nothing you can do
---
if one of the posts does get removed then contact the mods of the dbd forums
---
I think she would be fine if they didn't totally fuck up the range addons to also give 35% charge speed when paired, while simultaneously having the -accuracy stat do nothing.
---
They could make some adjustments to Nurse without changing her power drastically.
---
Make it so Nurse visibly appears on your screen after a blink before she hits you, so that if you are running DH you can be physically able to react to it. As it is rn Nurse can hit you before you can even see her appear after the blink if she taps m1 instead of lunging.
---
Make her blink lunges shorter, which will make sloppy blinks more punishing.
---
Make it impossible to stack range add ons/nerf ataxic Respiration, rework the extra blink add ons to do something else.

I actually don't use Ruin because I have extremely bad luck and it's always gone in an instant. Also, I get too obsessive trying to protect the totem to the point gens are being completed because I'm not applying enough pressure because I keep checking back on the totem too much.
---
Hes uncle ace isnt he?
---
That is not true. Overcharge doesn't even faze mediocre survivors. They can do the skillcheck and just keep going and you would be non the wiser. Also the forced skillcheck mechanic allows them to tap and and start running and even if they missed it they would be miles away as that gives them a headstart. Overcharge with unnerving presence would be nice and the right addons but am sorry OC doesn't even compare to SU
---
Quentin, from zero to hero in a single patch XD

I tried several times to type out an explanation but it just made things more confusing. Just look at the image I posted?

---
Does spine chill affect vaults? The perk description doesn’t mention it.
---
I would upvote you but your comments at 69
---
I thought they kept the "safe unhooks count towards a stack as well" but oof either way. 
---
I do admit I like the newer MoM more than the old one bc this new one is a perk you have to earn. I frankly disagree with the concept that perks that grant extra hits are unfair bc imo, if killer get to have access to things like instadowns and kills through make your choice, Tuftstone myers, the Ebony Mori, haunted ground, devour hope, etc. I think it's ok for Surviviors to have perks that grant additional hits, as long as the player has to actively earn it. 
---
And then this idea that Surviviors Shouldn't be allowed to have strong perks. This is another issue I take with the killer community. Why should it take 4 Surviviors to equal 1 killer? That leaves 0 room for skill expression on the Surviviors end of things. Strong Survivior perks are allowed to exist, and I'm glad they do. It makes Playing killer more fun when the Surviviors aren't just a helpless group of babies who go down the moment a killer sees them.
---
Don't use Stridor.
---
I am, I’m seeing the different colors and descriptions of the med-kits, nothing more? I don’t get what’s meant by rotating between rarities
---
A Killer that is so supremely op compared to the survivors that you need to be braindead to lose as jason
---
I believe that gens are being done too fast. Ruin is mandatory because otherwise a game won't last longer than 5 minutes. Genrush is a problem, genrush is the only reason skilled killers still use noed.
---
Id say killer is a lot easier than survivor. You dont have to depend on your team (huge plus), you get a lot more points per game and you can capitalize on the survivors mistakes if they cant play as a team.
---
She is plague marine level of resillient... In my that's tougher than pig, legion, ghostface and all human in the list. Hag tier definelty is underpopulated atm. Meyers being S tier is a meme. A good one tbf.

---
idiot things like a demon and slenderman for an example aren't human and never were someone made a thread about slenderman last week
---
Im going to have to disagree that overcharge is easy to hit. Being on madness effect makes it really difficult even on the high ranked survivors.
---
Introducing the DBD real money auction house
---
How would one go about doing that?
---
Easily new favorite killer for me. Honestly I wish they would go with some more older killers. Hag is really cool with her baba yaga feel and I love huntress because she has that classic go into the woods and get murdered feel from ages past.
---
There shouldn’t be 4 perks and a hex slot, that’s just dumb. Survivors shouldn’t get 4 perks and a exhaustion perk.  It should be, how can I win this game with only four perks on both sides, you just need you mind game the killer/survivor, that’s how you win in most games.
---
Go fuck yourself. Wasn’t rude at all until you started it.
---
a literal doll? you can't do that as he's too small it would have to be the doll in human form matching the size of all other killers.
---
Yeah OoO happened exactly once and she was terrible and the first one I hooked... I'm thinking this is a PC issue lol
---
Yea, all these pety arguments where people call out the other sides players or tactics would be gone if all players understood the strengths and weaknesses of both roles.
---
Before it gets deleted: I'd suggest promoting this with Disboard.

Maybe i'm just not a good judge, but imo they aren't very similar.

Different eyes, Hair detail, Clothing detail, Text, Signature, Color scheme, theme. Probably could find more differing styles.
---
The only thing similar is your presentation, which honestly like 90% of them share.
---
UPDATE: my account on the forum has been jailed?
---
I like playing against Nurse, Myers, and miss Piggy
---
Atleast you don’t want to die because you’re team can’t play
---
My favourite to go against is Myers, Pig, and LF.
---
The thing about Nurse is that her only weaknesses are mindgames and tracking. As she gives a damn at everything else that is. However, with those 2 things being her ONLY weakness, she doesn't have to compensate anything else. Ruin is the best example. A good Nurse would never touch Ruin or NOED simply because it's not worth it. Go with 4 perks that help you to track and detect Survivors and you have an easy time. You don't need Ruin, Sloppy, NOED, Devour Hope or whatsoever. Thanks to your bare pressure and lethality you're stalling the game harder than any of the other Killers. And that simply thanks you your abillity. No perk-synergies requiered like a cheesy Doctor with Distressing, Calm+Order, Unnerving, Ruin and Overcharge.
---
But I also think blinks are just "easy mode" thanks to short-blinks being a thing. When a Nurse wouldn't be able to just tap M2 and get a free hit without counterplay oppurtunity each time to blinks within close range, she would be less of an issue. Especially since all the wannabe-Nurse's who do literally nothing else would be cucked.
---
Getting fucked by a really good Nurse is one thing. Getting fucked by a Nurse that has just played her for a total of 3 hours and abuses short-blinks on the other hand...Sucks.

I've played the hag. And got many traps triggered by the survivors.
---
Ew weebs
---
I don’t think the head turning looks so bad and it helps killers know when survivors are looking at them.
---
It’s their fault it’s in the game, why ban people who want to abuse it? I’ll abuse the shit out of it because it’s their fault entirely. GGGGGG

It depends on how you want to look at it.
---
Yes, Myers is evil incarnate, but that's his inherent nature. It's no different to an animal mauling a human being, it's simply in their nature.
---
Freddy on the other hand, targeted children out of perversion and sadism. He has the edge, in my eyes.
---
And balloons? Pennywise confirmed
---
The real reason why they filled in tile walls on Coldwind maps
---
Billy, huntress (when not proxy camping) and probably Myers tbh. I've found all these killers tend to actually play the game and it's not just the same exact playstyle every single time I see them.
---
Thanks this helps a lot. I had long chases but at the end I got the survivor with 2 hits. Sometimes I could hit a other survivor but I think this was only 2 times that that happen. But your post helps. Didn't know that a long chase is bad for the killer.
---
I had this bug too. Not puking at the end as work aroung seems to work. But that's a nasty bug.
---
NOED makes the game so fucking easy. 
---
I got from Rank 20 to 1 with 3 people escaping through doors, 17 escaping overall. In the unlikely event someone actually got to the end, NOED saved me. It's the biggest crutch I've ever seen in a game.
---
the angles of yellow and green look very similar
---
Just an idea
---
You're definitely over thinking the entire subject, and being overly aggressive towards like everyone here.
---
Just chill and have an actual conversation, like the HUMAN you are lol.
---
Stop making instadowns. It's boring.
---
You know...
---
Fuck spirit bud. Every single spirit I've gone against has been scum for some reason or another and I'm not a survivor main. Not to mention her bullshit passive minigames are just fucking stupid and lazy. Also I dislike her character anyway cus of the whole weeaboo shit.
---
Stealth plays definitely need to be somewhere in the survival category. Would help it out a lot. Close calls that didn't wind up in a chase could count as stealth.
---
Ik a lot of people make fun of "Blendette's" but I think when people are actually actively helping the team, stealth play isn't terrible.
---
Not my thing though.
---
The recent patch only changed the way it works on gens or other objects like that. running animation is just placebo
---
also, that's a much needed QoL change for killers
---
Same
---
He also gets looped and using the chainsaw gives a lot of announcement on when he plans to attack. He also does have a high learning curve, just not as big as Nurse's, but I doubt they could ever realistically make a Killer with a big learning curve than her and it's why she's rewarded by being one of the very few Killers that are able to directly do something about looping.
---
i think he means the medkit itself rotates from left to right (but 2 and 3 are kinda the same?) so idk what he means
---
It does.
---
If they wiggle, they will break out and be vulnerable. They wouldn’t wiggle to waste as much time as possible, basically
---
&gt;Spotted the Billy-player I suppose?
---
Killer player, don't really main Billy, no.
---
&gt;Hitting curves around loops is more or less common sense.
---
It takes practice and experience to predict how the survivor is going to move around the loop. Sure if you are going vs potatoes that will run in straight line, it's very simple. But so can be said about playing any other killer if the survivors aren't really using their brains.
---
Billy has a lot of counterplay, which in itself makes him harder to play if the survivors know what to do against him. Against good survivors, Billy isn't that good.
---
&gt;And this is simply due to his base-stats being too high in comparasion to what his abillity is capable of. A Killer with one-shot and high mobillity just shouldn't have 115% ms. Or rather more, if they want to keep Billy like this, they better adjust the other Killers.
---
He'd be god awful with less than 115% ms, he gets looped already and a good survivor will force you to m1. His mobility and instadown wouldn't matter if he'd just get looped wherever he went.
---
&gt;I don't see a reason why Hag runs around at 110% ms when Billy has even more.
---
Hag can lock down an area completely, her traps allow her to nullify pallets and entire loops. Her teleportation is really strong. She doesn't get looped, that's why she's 110%, simmilar to why Spirit is 110%. Rin doesn't get looped either.
---
&gt;You don't need fancy backrev's or any cheap anti-loop attempts to have success with Billy. Not at all to be fair.
---
Yes, vs bad survivors that don't know how to loop. 
---
&gt;Nurse has actually much more "skill-expression" than many people think. But that's simply because Nurse is too abusive in terms of short blinks. Also the very "feature" that bothers me the most about Nurse. Shortblinking is much too easy and lacks counterplay. Just like insta-saw Billy.
---
It's much better to do "short blinks". If you are against survivors that are more experienced and won't run in predictable patterns then shorter, more precise blinks are the way to go.
---
&gt; A Nurse that blinks onto you just to tap M2 and get a free-hit ain't a good Nurse but simply abuses her.
---
What else are you supposed to do? Not blink at them?
---
Because beyond purely making the game harder, No Mither doesn't give anything that's fun. I think it would be more fun if it had some kind of mechanic or interaction that gave access to a rewarding byt difficult to pull off playstyle. I think that something like Save The Best For Last is fun because of the way it forces you to come at the game from a different direction. The only playstyle that No Mither gives is "don't get hit". It limits how one can play the game instead of diversifying it.
---
Maybe if the survivors aren’t smart and don’t just leave if there’s NOED. It’s certainly not worse than a bugged perk which makes the game unwinnable for killers. If your angry they bring a strong perk, and so you bring a bugged perk, grow up
---
I think because the layout is similar (full body, weapon and head detail) but that is only cause that's how we have been taught to do character sheets in school.
---
I mean Dead Hard kinda sucks, besides of fucking Nurse and being able to close gaps between you and pallets/vaults on rare occasions I don't like it because it's too easy to mindgame.
---
But I agree on that lunge-accuracy. I personally think the worst thing about Nurse are short-blinks as they've no skill-requierement and lack counterplay. It drags her into a bad light as there are just soo many people out there who do nothing on Nurse but short-blink, that they'd be rendered absolutely useless if they couldn't blink once they're within 4 metres of Survivor-range.
---
But Add-ons still requiere to be reworked. Plaid Flannel shouldn't even exist while Nurse aswell as Billy still lack their overhauled add-ons. Tuning Guide shouldn't be green/rare but purple/very-rare, Plaid Flannel should be removed as already mentioned. When they're on it they can actually also actually make the range-increasing add-ons have less accuracy as they should. And stuff like this. It's definetly not impossible to make Nurse more friendly. As in to play with her aswell as against her. But it must be thought-out well as the border between her being OP or trash is dangerously small.
---
It's a sad day when a bug could potentially make a perk viable.
---
They made it with behaviour so it’s not really a rip of if they helped them make the game
---
Michael didn’t kill the baby because he knew that the baby was to young to fully understand true fear and that’s all he wants, he’s like the entity he feeds off of fear that’s what keeps him killing.

Yeah, BHVR never did anything like that to a Killer on release, did they? *D A R N*
---
I mean, i think ochido ear rape in all of his clips, and he never wpuld incluide a guide on his videos, and those are literally the only sound effects that i find

---
Oh, great...
---
I’m going to get downvoted for this but I honestly don’t see what’s wrong with tunneling, why would I go after a healthy survivor when I could go after a possibly injured survivor who has already got hooked once?
---
The second part really gets my OCD goin..
---
I get that spirit can be unfun with gen grabber build or totem grabber, especially if prayer beads are used, but many killers have one broken add on. Other than that spirit is fun imo. Her mind games are fun, because if spirit guesses wrong she can't immediately fix it like the nurse can.
---
&gt;Also I dislike her character anyway cus of the whole weeaboo shit.
---
You dislike her just because she's Japanese? Every character has weird fans like the people who think Pig or Huntress are cute or the people that want shirtless Myers. Just ignore them.

Lets say you play a game and no one hits the overcharge. 1st It alerts them and they leave. 2nd they lose 5 seconds of progress. 3rd The generator stops regressing. 4th They can tap and leave. 5th Madness 2 only has a 66% of triggering a skillcheck. On a side note i have played only about 5 impossible skillcheck docs this year and ALL of them got 1-2 kills because i sit at red ranks. Surveillance. 1. Allows you to know if the gen is being worked on. 2. Can help you prioritize gens in a 3 gen sitiuation. 3. Can have great synergy with Overcharge and Pop Goes the Weasel. 4. Great for high mobility killers. 5. Can allow a Beam shock doc to protect gens at great distances. 6. Allows stealth killers to actually get the jump on survivors. 7. Requires intuition on the survivor's side to know about the perk and what it does for them to capitalize on it slightly. (might be a problem to low mobility killers if they tap to bait. Unlike failing overcharge which EXPLODES a gen and have them run away. Unless you play in green ranks i don't see OC being viable without a Doc build especially around skillchecks
---
If they wiggle you get stunned. That stun is enough for them to get back to the locker, you can't hit them instantly after they wiggle out.

1. I agree

2. Holy fuck yes I agree 100%

I dont think self care is the problem here

Is that Kate or meg?

---
It's not, I believe bitter murmur may very well be bugged in terms of the bubble overlapping the auras, not suppose to happen and the auras are really inconsistent as far as actually showing me the auras, only noticed this since the new update so possibly another bugged perk. And the perk doesn't suck btw, not exactly an amazing perk but it is decent and gives some pretty good info especially for huntress
---
Nurse on PS4 is probably low A tier. Legion, old Freddy and the Plag dud are probably the strongest ones.
---
What kind of fix are you thinking of? IMO he is just fine as of now. But we all know that the devs are afraid to release a "fine" killer because of some entitled survivor mains.
---
Ultimately not my problem. I like the art though.

Yeah the Santa set. It's kinda weird and gross.

Are you trying to say nurse and billy aren’t top tier? Not calling for a nurse or billy nerf, id just like for more killers to be considered high tier so I don’t play against 87% billy or nurse.
---
I agree that it is a bit unfair but I also think that the bloodpoint effects of both BBQ and WGLF should be baseline for killers and survivors. I don't think you should need to run a perk to double the BP. I just think that you should be able to earn these extra bloodpoints by hooking multiple survivors, encourages not tunneling, and survivors should be able to earn their extra BP without wasting a perk slot.
---
As killer I fell like I NEED to run BBQ or I'm wasting my time getting half the bloodpoints I would otherwise. The grind is insane in this game and it takes for ever even with BBQ. Without it yours peding twice as long farming.
---
Wouldn't be the dumbest thing BHVR has done lmao but I seriously doubt they'd change it no warning.
---
I mean, you SHOULD use Dead hard to gain distance to the window/pallet, there isn't anything a killer can do about you doing that unless it's a huntress. Using it do dodge a swing is bad, yeah.

Shut your mouth you mediocre clarinet player...
---
Most of the good advice has been given (I can't stress enough how amazing and useful standing still is as a mindgame), but I want to add that you should only phase shift as much as you feel comfortable with. I actually refuse to phase shift during a chase unless I'm *sure* I know where they're going (i.e., they're standing still next to a pallet), and I still get 4Ks. However, this isn't the best strategy, so if you're willing to take risks and phase shift based off a guess, do it. What I'm trying to say is that if you phase shift during a chase and lose them, try doing that less and depending more on old-fashioned legwork.
---
Killers need longer matches to have a chance to have fun. I've played matches with certain power up killers that just straight dont get to do anything cus they never got their power to a decent level. Survivors gen rushing is going to negatively impact the killers enjoyment and is going to force them to bring meta perks just to counter it. Gens being done so quickly causes more issues than just killers getting poor games. It stops killers from using weird niche builds because without some kind of gen ability they will just get slapped.
---
No just make it the base becuvse hers is 2.8 and the other have 3.4/6
---
Where are few good ones, I lost few matches against them, but I play against them very rarely. I haven't really take a note, but it's probably the same guy lol.
---
No nurse needs at least 267% movement
---
Honestly some of the killer achievements are hard to get. The number of people deliberately making it difficult is staggering. Don't give yourself up, but don't DC, and if you've lost maybe consider just letting the killer have it!
---
You're super power is being able to run and crouch and hide and you get a 3rd person camera. Not to mention survivors get wayyyyyy more bullshit perks than killers. Also you guys working together is enough to get out without losing anyone. Any 4 man swf that goes super try hard is going to win against 99% of killers.

I don't think the Spirit's fun, as her "mind-games" conclude of either standing in place or walking around the loop to feel for the survivor's hitbox. Spirit is just a weaker, more frustrating version of the Nurse to me; at least the Nurse ends the game quickly.
---
That’s nice to hear🙂

You know they were in a meeting and someone was all "vrenavue conpueque boo pee pee frenda vew" in French and Mcote was all "Wow, dats a grweat idea! We could make milliuns off dallurss weeth mobile game" its gonna flop, its a whorrible idea.
---
Yeah the community loves Billy so everyone who dares to say something against him can expect a shit-storm.
---
Experience yes. But as I've already mentioned before it's a basic-experience for Killers. A skill you should have while playing Killer in general, not specific Killer. But simply because you need some experience it isn't hard. Short-blinking on Nurse also ain't hard, yet you still have to learn how the blinks emselfes behave. Which's a simple matter of time, not of "mastering the challenge".
---
And when it comes up to counterplay it depends on the situation. A Billy that's within M1-tap range and rev's the saw is almost undodgeable when the Billy doesn't lack the brain to not go for the saw instantly but wait for a fitting moment while they patheticly attempt to dodge. Which mostly won't work anyway. Especially since his hitbox is like 50% thiccer than his actuall model is, making it even harder to attempt any close-range saw dodges.
---
And yes, ofcourse he'd be worst than he's now with less ms. A nerf is a nerf, not a buff lol. But yeah, that's the very issue about it. The loops. Without loops it wouldn't be that dramatic to nerf his ms down to 110%. But sadly a Huntress without hatchets can already be looped into infinity. So I agree on that one. Doesn't make it less dumb tho.
---
Hag is absurdely limited by the time-management. The game's too fast paced for Hag's to even get into the game before it's over. Similar to Trapper. Sure, depending on the situation they have chances to make a comeback, but that depends more on the Survivor's fucking up than the Killers 'emselfes playing good.
---
And to be honest playing versus Survivors that "don't know how to loop" is pretty rare if you ain't playing at the 5 lowest ranks. It's not like looping is an art. There's a reason why it's that despised for a so long time already. Because it is easy, impactful and consistent. Sure, a Hag can force you to leave the loop, but the trapping time in combination with her ms and the fact that she's most likely on the other page of the loop while trapping, gives the Survivor lots of time to increase the gap and head to the next loop. Hag's the most dangerous when you're playing on a map you don't know anything about.
---
And ofcourse are short blinks better. You give me the feeling that you don't listen at all. Or don't bother to understand me, regardless it's rude. The topic is that the best Killers should have a specific skill-requierement to be used efficiently. This is why we started talking about Billy, because I think that Billy lacks said specific requierement which Nurse, Spirit and Huntress in common met. And this is also the issue I see with short blinks. They're too easy to pull of and lack counterplay.
---
And no, you're not supposed to not blink at them but blink directly on them from a certain range. That's what makes the short-blinks so dumb since it promotes sloppy blinks and lessen the requierement of accuracy you SHOULD have. There's a difference when a Nurse blinks DIRECTLY onto you and smacks you, and a Nurse that blinks within 4m~ range and taps m2 for said short-blink. The very difference is, as already mentioned, that the skill-requierement is much lower while also rewarding the Nurse for playing with less accuracy. Something that shouldn't be when it comes up for a that broken abillity as hers. But that's just my opinion.
---
That sounds like a very well thought out build. I'll give it a go :)
---
No I'm saying there is actually a genuinely good reason most killers enjoy playing those two. At the endgame lobby I always get some version of "oh boy another billy" because people didn't get the gg ez killers like freddy. People who whine like that dont even want balance.
---
Wow didn't know I'd have season 4 spoiled for me on a dbd subreddit
---
gg easy.
---
The Doctor is an M1 killer to me, so just run the basic M1 build(BBQ, Enduring, Ruin, SF).

This is good quality

If you were actually capable of paying attention, it would be clear that being hooked isn't the problem in and of itself, but instead having no chance to play again when hooked the first time due to camping or tunneling.
---
I feel like all of the crippled children had a crutch kicked out of their grasp and they fell over. Glad its gone, perk was horseshit. Made to help sell Ash Ketchum.

If he’s delusional, why do you have the downvotes?

Lol, of course it's my opinion. What the hell?
---
Dude would you chill out. Some of us still have to get adept Quentin.
---
He isn’t listening anyone else agree with me?
---
Well what's the problem in general, if bhvr would find a way to nerf billy and nurse in a how to say mindful way, they when could buff all of the killers, and make them viable and more fun for survivors to play.
---
This is why I like playing on console, where is actually variety in killers, because mastering nurse is hard. When was the last time you played against hag or clown in red ranks? I even meet Freddie sometimes.
---
I hope to god you’re just talking about this comment and you don’t know me from *other* dbd related subreddits but if you know then you know
---
If you want more BP than an average 15-20K then play killer too, not just survivor. Nothing's wrong with BBQ they nerfed the aura reading by hiding in lockers (good nerf), the BP gains is an encouragement to chase other survivors and not just chase, tunnel, and camp one. Rewards you for moving around and the auras are meant to have you move away from the hooked survivor.
---
"This isn't a man"
---
Tbh I couldnt play this game on console.  
---
But since this isn't about my preferences, I would just like to see them lifting any killer to billies/spirits/nurses level.
---
Why are you surprised? They fuck over half the game with each update, wait (atleast) half of a month to fix it. If not fixed quick enough, they start handing out bans like its our fault, THEN they fix it.
---
The grey medkit leans slightly to the left, the purple leans slightly to the right.
---
I went off him because he just moans at everything, and he passive aggressively goes off on anyone in his chat who has a different opinion than him. Also when he’s playing survivor he says he can’t get mad when he loses because it’s HIS fault, never the killer actually being good at the game. Yeah he’s a decent killer but please, his ego is out of control.
---
Very accurate representation
---
Because this sub is full of killer mains
---
Wake Up is bugged so that the 15% speed to opening exit gates is applying to everything, even window vaulting.
---
Lmao, survivors are 50% responsible for being on a hook. Get good.
---
Killers have to baby sit all of the gens and monitor 4 people. Of course gens are gonna go fast, quit bitching, get good.
---
Meme sucks monkey shit btw.
---
The name though.
---
You can disagree with him, but he's objectively right. Play at rank 1 long enough and you'll realize both those perks are garbage.
---
Well I haven't seen it from that point of view yet, in that regard you're absolutely right. Ofcourse said add-ons increase her chase-capabillities. Which are high enough already even without add-ons.
---
When it comes up to Plaid Flannel tho...When they're making it default I want the option to turn it off. I've played Nurse for almost 3 years now (Legacy 3 and such), and when there's one thing I've learned about the add-ons, it's that Plaid Flannel is destructive rather more than productive. 
---
Introducing new players to Nurse by telling them to focus on a indicator instead on the very Survivor itself damages the learning curve extremely. Building a muscle memory works the best by don't attempt to focus from the very beginning. As this is what muscle memory is. The body reacting to a incentive. You as Nurse should focus on the Survivor and their movement, as you've to adept to every Survivor individually in higher ranks to have success. Nurse might be broken but Survivors that are capable of mindgaming and stealthing against a good Nurse is something that should be respected.
---
But I also think that the reason, why Billy's and Nurse's add-ons haven't been touched yet, is because they're still thinking about what to do with 'em. Sure, some changes are easy, as in nerfing tuning guide from R to VR. But Nurse's range-addons that also "reduce her accuracy" (which they don't do) are a different story. And Nurse doesn't work like Wraith, Wraith's brown add-ons are great for varying playstyles but imagining something like this on Nurse is pretty tough. Like, what do they want to do? Make her terror-radius global while she travels during the blink and a bunch of seconds after? Could actually be pretty cool and support Caulrophobia synergy but I still think she lacks the possibillities other Killers potentially have, simply due to the power of the blinks emselfes.
---
It's a game calm down buddy
---
Maurice is crying now, are you happy?
---
Apply your logic to the killer. Killing survivors is their objective.
---
Amen
---
and you know what all you did not will be considered at all from the devs. it is a subreddit not a support
---
You got salty about a crutch perk.
---
Yea that’s just for The Game.
---
aren't you sure that Hag didn't had Thrill of the Hunt running Rusty Shackles and Mint Rag?
---
This happened to me oncw and I was very annoying. Didn't know it was linked with the exit gate thing though.
---
DARN
---
The longest i’ve had to wait was ~25 minutes. Maybe its your connection? Im not sure
---
yes selfcare is ass its annoying and it wastes a lot of time. i died on hook bc someone was selfcaring :(
---
Lmao definitely not bud. I get knocked out of stealth across the map and most matches I end up losing 2 or 3 gens for 1 hook.
---
Hag.
---
“Hey guys, let’s go save Dwight, he got caught in the basement.”
---
“Where’s the killer...?”

“Okay Dwight, I gotcha bb-  WAAUGH Oh my god!”

---
*Hook scream*

“Something’s down there...”
---
Ik its pretty bad rn for killer and I dont kmow why. Its only about 30% of the time that they play Ghostface so people wanting to play him is not the problem
---
He really is starting to cry alot.
---
Hard agree, honestly, even though people have moved to other exhaustion perks now over SB (which was the most popular one a few patches ago) i hardly see Lithe and for a good reason. Poor little perk.
---
Could’ve downed him at the exit gate and a hook wasn’t close enough to carry him to.
---
its getting better after bloodhunt has ended, for me at least. 5min atm. give it a couple more days.
---
Not to mention the can't heal myself with self care or med kit and that happens too often. If you happen to get to the gates while the no heal bug is active you don't escape you just run around outside till entity kills you cause the killer is gonna laugh at you while not giving you the hatch that you earned by escaping but the game glitched so fuck me.
---
Just run Adrenaline and Iron Will and do gens injured, bruh.
---
Reading Reddit and Spotify help you stay sane
---
We self care before saving so we can take a hit for you if the killer comes during the unhook. Also, there's 2 other survivors who can go for the save. It's not the perks fault.
---
Definitely.
---
&gt;the community loves Billy so everyone who dares to say something against him can expect a shit-storm.
---
What did I say or do that makes it a shitstorm? I haven't insulted you, ignored your opinion or questioned your competence, I just have a different opinion. The discussion has been pretty civil so far, maybe I just got a wrong impression?
---
&gt;Short-blinking on Nurse also ain't hard, yet you still have to learn how the blinks emselfes behave. Which's a simple matter of time, not of "mastering the challenge".
---
In the same vain learning how to use your chainsaw, learning the timing, at what distance you can curve, etc. A competent survivor won't let you run up to them and backrev them. He takes a lot of practice against those that actually know how to play around your chainsaw. (Not counting add ons, we are talking about base kits here.)
---
Billy is great in uncoordinated soloQ, where people let him get easy chainsaws off and don't loop well. If billy is going against competent players that know how to play around him, he's not too good.
---
&gt;Hag is absurdely limited by the time-management. The game's too fast paced for Hag's to even get into the game before it's over. Similar to Trapper. Sure, depending on the situation they have chances to make a comeback, but that depends more on the Survivor's fucking up than the Killers 'emselfes playing good.
---
You are not supposed to chase normally with Hag as you would with Wraith or Doctor. If you run after the survivor from loop to loop and just set traps at the loop till you run out of loops, then yeah Hag is god awful.
---
Hag excells at hit-and-run tactics. At the start of the match you choose an area/half of the map, and set a gigantic carpet of traps till you run out of traps. Then you keep hold of that area. You tp to traps that get set off, get a hit. Retrap and keep chasing till another trap gets set off and repeat. You don't fully commit to long chases unless it's really late into the game. If you play her in this area denying style, she'll be way more successful.  
---
I don't really agree with the argument about changing short blinks. With that change you make nurse not so good at dealing with pallets/loops. You'd have to increase her base movement speed if she couldn't blink at short distances.
---
its not even just in this situation either. its wasting times where another survivor could heal way faster, or they could be doing gens.
---
I swear he does jazz bands when you pull someone out a locker. I love it

If you're playing with friends in a SWF, sure. But play solo and get a bunch of randos who hide the whole match or don't help. No thanks, I'll keep my self care.
---
Literally any map in this game has windows and pallets, LOL.
---
It's 3 years worth of bugs in one patch.
---
3 Years worth of bugs for the 3 year anniversary.

Say it again for the people in the back

My point exactly.

I mean, you aren’t wrong-

So basically, bring a gun to the trial and you've got a fair chance

He is speaking the language of gods...
---
Yeah the perk doesn't suck (I was a little salty theee ngl), but the aura inconsistency is reallyyyyy annoying
---
*this patch is so bugged*
---
I think he should be "The Scream" but The Ghost is good too
---
its because:
---
1. survivors get less bp per match
---
2. survivors have to deal with these million bugs since the patch(cant exit, cant wiggle etc etc.)
---
3. ghostface got released
---
Yes if it torture u so much than I'm happy.  Cause i don't give a fuck. It's just a game.
---
Ive got to say I have faced one or two very talented nurses on Xbox , it's rare but they exist 👽
---
It definitely distracted me!
---
There's this much bugs as survivor?
---
They just need to rebuild the game dude. Every single thing they do or add causes game breaking bugs. That's spaghetti code to end all spaghetti code.
---
I'm with you, selfish-care drives me crazy. Not to mention the amount of times i've seen people get downed by Nurses Calling, because they're behind a rock healing for 30+ seconds.
---
I think this hits the mark. I remember one day I was watching a TrU3Ta1ent video where he was playing survivor. The killer he was against was going out of his way to tunnel the shit out of one survivor. I remember Tru3 saying something to the effect of 'This guy must not play survivor. People who've play survivor don't play like that on killer.'  
---
  
---
I've played both rolls since I started. I remember getting hit by a 4-man DS squad back before the rework. I never once ran DS, because I knew from experience how broken it was. I don't think you can really have perspective without playing both sides.
---
Wiki says the green map offerings give 9999 probability to have that map. 9999 it's probably the max. you can get so they don't stack. 9999 Game offering and 9999 Haddonfield offering will have the same probabily of these two.
---
afaik the game is free
---
Make sure you run that perk that makes survivors near you 'scream'.
---
He didnt say disagreeing is an issue on the contrary. Being an ass to a streamer because you disagree with him is the issue pointed out.
---
*bruh man oof*
---
i actually just tried this last night and i got a 4k from 3 genning with it:
---
thrilling tremors, discordance, overcharge, and ruin 
---
someone was running wake up so i knew when they were touching my gens and i broke chases to go to the discordance gens
---
tremors is like barbecue but it protects the gens not being worked on and gives you the gen(s) you need to go to
---
overcharge for banking that they won’t hit the skillcheck and reversing gen progress
---
ruin is obvious but one of them brought a map so it was cleansed in the first 3 minutes
---
genrush meta? not in my god damn lobby
---
Well its just an idea i've had while watching the Evil Dead franchise and seeing how Ash is super badass and capable of taking on some tough foes. So i only compared them to the killers in Dbd. Writing it took about an hour but it y'know its just a way for me to skip time while waiting for my vacation.
---
This also happened to me but was able to escape through hatch.
---
Honestly i don't even run Adrenaline anymore. Too many NOEDs, i feel like i'm an insta down even at full hp during EGC.
---
1st, Hag can get her traps down relatively quick without sacrificing too much in game time. This is helped by perks.
---
As for Nurse, she literally has no way otger than blinks to catch up. If a survivor was 4m in front of me, I would have to blink to get in range of hitting them. :/
---
40-50% of GF's body was shown between seconds 5-9. 4 seconds alone should be enough to reveal him.
---
Yeah, cool, nice, bueno, bravo, very kek, OK and all. But how do I even find someone by standing still?

Evil Incarnate: Myers, Freddy, Doctor
---
Typical Serial Killer: Clown, Ghost Face, Amanda
---
No Sense Of Right And Wrong: Trapper, Leatherface, Huntress, Hillbilly
---
Had One Bad Day: Nurse, Legion
---

---
Killers are ordered within the tiers, so Clown is closer to Evil Incarnate, and Amanda is closer to No Sense Of Right And Wrong. Trapper could probably go in any of the middle three tiers, but I figured he was poisoned by his upbringing like Leatherface. Right and Wrong and One Bad Day could be switched, or considered equal.
---
*Frank, get back to your corner*
---
Is there an Ash in the party or are you Ash. Cause he has voicelines that play in lobbies
---
so many people villainize the doctor and it’s just so frustrating and tiring at this point
---
I'm sorry you can't listen to or understand other people's opinions. Must be lonely being right all the time.
---
They don’t have rights to the scream franchise, so that would cause legal troubles
---
Lol you went in an entire ass custom game for this shot
---
He decided to stop talking about balance for a few day. That sounds like a mature way to keep streaming despite his frustration about last patch. We can disagree with his opinion on GF or on balance. The thing is their isnt much in term of constructed debate on GF especially on twitch. I dont care about GF but I can understanbd ppl disapointed atm. I dont see any streamer doing really well with GF at red rank atm.
---
Where are all these nurses? I rarely play against the nurse. It's mostly ghostface, plague, or the hag Inget stuck against.
---
I forgot he even plays nurse. He doesn't use that on her, but if she gets reworked to get pallet stunned during blinks (hypothetically) I'm pretty sure he will. I really only see value in that build on wraith and maybe trapper, but definitely not Ghostface.
---
Games for for killer for me typically take about 3-5 mins but hey I'll take what I can get.
---
How many hooks were available near the gates?
---
You can run but you can’t hide!

bitch
---
 He gon' find another girl and he won't miss ya
---
I mean I don't kink shame, but doing a whole jazz band in like 2s is pretty impressive.
---
you seem fairly upset that i have a different opinion about the perk, because im using my understanding of the game to justify my way of thinking.
---
Throwing my money at the screen right now
---
Awwww BITCH...
---
Yeah - I just 180 every nurse (am only rank 8, so maybe the pro killers are much better), and they always miss. 
---
I reckon I am doing ok for level 30ish (bought the game last week). 
---
I imagine that rank 1 nurses on xbox should be pretty decent.
---
Congrats.
---
That's fair
---
Ghostface sounds more like "Ugh... really?" Because that's a hella long sigh.
---
Nah, Game is survivor sided
---
I'll unhooked injured, unless they're camping. Oddly, red-purple doesn't tend to have many campers.
---
WALK up to the hook (no scratch marks near hook!), stay out of LOS wait till heart beat is gone. Boom safe unhook. Also get this, i'm now near an injured team mate. 30 seconds, and we're both full hp. 
---
With selfish-care, i would still be healing (or just finishing) and the killer is likely making his return trip to hook, to make sure everything is good at home.
---
I don't completely agree with your opinion. It's almost like saying that a killer needs to win in order to have fun, which, to be fair, is usually the case for most players. However, there is a difference between literally not being able to do anything and trying your best and still end up with a 1 or 0k. That doesn't mean that trying a new build isn't fun. I have died countless times as a survivor while still having fun, I have had 4ks against the most toxic assholes imaginable and had no fun whatsoever. So winning is, in my opinion, not always equal to fun.
---
I see dead people
---
Even this week. When ask about killer ranking he always mention that clown slow prevent him from being bottom tier.
---
Just run wake up it got buffed duh lol, baby survivor
---
Lol I'm not upset at all. You just seem set in your opinion about self care so there's no reason for me to continue.
---
Haahahahahahha. Now I know you’re fuckin delusional.
---
Doc could probably do something with electricity that just makes the bullet go away

---
It’s ash
---
There's literally nothing wrong with him he's as close as balanced as you can get. -.- Some survivors will blame everything except themselves for their loss.

you know they will.most likely ban abusers, like they did with infinite mending or 2 Killers in Lobby users?

Are any of them human anymore?
---
wh— iron will makes it so you dont make noise, so they dont hear you. bond is useful by making it so you can: find survivors to heal you AND give you info about where gens are, who the killer is on , and tons more info
---
r/rimjobsteve
---
You say that, but I only seem to see Ghostface once every five or six matches or so
---
Doesn't mean it's not true. But from the responses I can gather that some people need to tunnel
---
Nice !
---
Also the dbd team is aware of matchmaking lengths of waiting and it’s on their schedule to fix it / rankings
---
Dead Hard not working, can't heal with self care or medkits, can't escape thru the opened gates, there are a few more all happening at once.
---
“must be lonely being right all the time” made you seem kinda pressed :-)
---
Noob here, what's a tombstone Myers ? 😅
---
At least killer are happy that someone basically stuns themselfs for 30 seconds.
---
facts 😌
---
That's just idiots. Idiots will always be idiots, no matter how good the perks they're running are. Someone who self-cares in front of teammates is also someone who walks literally everywhere instead of sprinting when the Killer is far away.
---
So stop complaining that a perk got you killed, and realise it was an idiot who did. Not the perk he ran.
---
I’ve had that healing bug before Ghostface came out. Couldn’t heal myself or anyone else.
---
[no](https://prnt.sc/ncgk95)
---
Good post. You actually put work into this and didnt just say "boomstick lawl". 8/10.
---
At this point I'm just gonna drop the subject and let yall call it whatever yall want.
---
but for everyone, even godlike players, its better to just have someone heal than self care and waste 30 seconds not helping the team at all
---
I meant because you don't seem to want to listen to any explanation. I don't get upset about stuff like video games, not worth it.
---
I don't even run bond, but i tend to find team mates way easier than people make it out to be. Bond will help you if you struggle there, and aura perks can be very useful in a ton of different ways. Selfish-care has 1 use.
---
Iron Will is one of the biggest clutch perks there is imo. From vanishing during chases, to just generally allowing you not to worry while injured.
---
Iron will, Exaust perk, Spine chill, and botany/BT. 
---
I'll pop gens while staying hidden, i win chases injured or not makes no difference. I can heal like a mad man.
---
Honestly if you want selfish-care. Run botany, with a medkit. Heal yourself and ALYS in a split second.
---
All the "randos running and hiding" in solo ques, are people like you lol. They're off hiding wasting 30+ seconds to heal every time they get hit too.
---
Oh ok thanks, I wonder why I never saw anything about it from the devs or other influencers. It's kind of game breaking and has me questioning my computer since I bought her so thanks a lot for the clarification.
---
I like this
---
I’m not gonna go into this debate on if the game is killer or survivor sided, if you think the game is survivor sided, then you suck at killer and mind gaming survivors, and if you think it’s killer sided then you suck as survivor and mind gaming the killer. Simple as that, people need only 4 perk slots to succeed at winning the game.
---
Ah shit wait what’s the joke
---
im just using my own reasoning to counterargue yours, but i respect you stopping
---
Thank you so much!
---
I'm just some italian dude, i never heard of and never cared about ash williams.

You're making me wannt to watch the series, now.

Hex: Huntress Lullaby
---
Thanks!
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted. I think he's pretty easy to play against (although I do think his pink insta-exposed add on needs a fix, although so does Myers).
---
I understand I was just curious what others would think.
---
hamigos. thats literally the cutest pun ive ever seen. besides that, her art is incredible. i love it
---
Bc a survivor good perk is usually nerfed in a week
---
Let me tell you about keys...
---
Pretty accurate yes.
---
Curse my fat fingers.
---
&gt; From this point forward I will be making occasional posts. Reports, Reminders, and even memes about the Legions useless add-ons in hopes that they will fix them. Thank you for reading. 
---
Abandon hope. Look at the Bubba's and Amanda's add-ons. Majority of them are useless. And developers dindu absolutely nuffin about it. I doubt they will with Legion. But i agree with everything you said though.
---
I meant for multiple use.
---
Made my fucking day LOL
---
I just think ghostface is a complete myers powercreep, so myers needs to be buffed. Lots of killers need buffs if the game is to be balanced around nurse.
---
I got her to level 30 then gave up. I don't quite know what it was. I just didn't feel like I was getting far with her. The Huntress was much easier and rewarding for me, and she is my main. I'm trying to get her to Prestige 3
---
I agree, self-care is hot garbage. Also in red ranks veryyyyy few people run it and opt for adrenaline instead. Self care had its merits sure, but anybody voraciously defending its use is NOT a survivor I want to be in a trial with.
---
This happened to me recently and I also couldn't wiggle when the killer picked me up
---
please tell your sister that i love her draugr idea. long live the dragonborn!
---
Thank you for checking her art. She really does pit alot of effort into everything.  I just wanted her to have a bit more recognition :)
---
I would love to play a lot more killer... but holy smokes do I have to wait a very long time to get a full lobby at lowranks 
---
 ლ(¯ロ¯"ლ)
---
Was on your side till that last bit.
---
How does Hillbilly have a high learning curve?  Or Nurse?  Sure, relative to other killers they might, but that’s just because most M1 killers involve almost no mechanical skill.  I don’t really see why killers like Nurse are hyped up so much as being insanely difficult when it seems like a lot of the learning curve just comes from learning blink ranges
---
I want this so so bad. I would die for this cosmetic
---
Last 50 games I've played, ~20 Ghostface, ~20 Plague, and the rest miscellaneous. So tired of Plague.
---
If he does not break out into the moonwalk after with David as a backup dancer, this is incomplete.
---
Yeah that’s was I was thinking. Made sense a couple days ago when everyone was ghost face but pretty much everyone has switched back to their mains at this point.
---
As someone who gets tunneled all game about 50% of the time, I cant afford to not run DS, balanced landing, self care, and adrenaline. Bond and iron will would be nice, but they arent good enough to warrant it. I understand your argument if you enjoy p3 claudette crouching in corners but that's not my playstyle.
---
Which in the end all comes down to swf isn't balanced and unless you use billy or nurse
---
Which is totally understandable, i dont understand how anyone this talented doesnt have more fans and attention
---
Probably not.
---
I had a game where I stared at him from three feet away and he managed to mark me.
---
LOL. I love doing the moonwalk on Myers. If I let a guy live, I moonwalk back and forth as he's opening the exit gate. Somehow Myers and David seem to go so well together.
---
yes, because people rarely escape with it. only hatch ):
---
Well, as others have said,  hope survivors like playing against the same three killers over and over.
---
Here's the thing you can attack the person who made the rescue instead of going after the injured survivor. It's a common trade off that most killers including myself do.
---
Tunneling is just a way survivors blame someone else for their own failure.
---
The killers job is to kill people. This means the following:
---
&gt;If you get a prompt that someone got unhooked, you're going to head for it.
---
&gt;If you see someone heading towards a hooked survivor, you're going to try and catch them unhooking
---
&gt;If you see two survivors and one of them is injured, you're probably going for the injured one
---
The reality of that situation is if you're injured, you're a priority target. If you get caught unhooking, you're going down first. The killer has absolutely no reason and gains no benefit whatsoever in most cases from NOT attacking the injured person. It's the sign of a *good* killer to make the tactically superior choice, not a *bad* one.
---
But nobody ever let the facts get in the way of a good old fashioned whinge.
---
Yikes the huntress on PS4 is very hard for me. Maybe it’s the worse frames but I can’t hit anything
---
With nurse, I prestiged her once, and spent a lot of time. I only started being really good with her addons that increase range, they stack and it’s disgusting how strong you are.
---
It also increases speed as you go further, so often you’ll get to survivors before they can juke you and it’s easier to aim. Try the ataxic respiration+ wooden horse or pinecone, you might find her much easier with them
---
No.
---
Theres literally an entirely different animation when turning during a chase. You never turned your entire torso when looking behind you before, it was just your head
---
Aside from the usual frame rate difference and harder aim. When you teleport on PC, you have improved vision of everything that goes around so you can calc your second (or third, fourth, fifth) and teleport better. It's not impossible, but it's harder to gauge where to teleport, how long to hold it, etc.
---
a bug gets fixed and an unfair mechanic gets tweaked....please inform yourself
---
Probably that cashier and the grocery map from ghostface trailer in a month or two.
---
Oh look. An American out smarted the rest.
---
He gets shot like 6 times in the original halloween after being stabbed in the neck and heart, and just gets up and walks off.
---
Because you're supposed to let them do gens and loop forever.   You also thank them for the endless teabagging.
---
At the moment I'm struggling to get him out of stalk mode, i feel like the 5 second timer to be exposed is too short, any advice? Just seems all it takes is bad timing to have him stalk you at the same time as a skill check.
---
If you ever played a game as Killer or Survivor where one Survivor immediately disconnected/suicided, you definitely would never say something like that.
---
This game is in NO WAY balanced for 3vs1.
---
does any of those posts creators even know about the upcoming Change?
---
He's not balanced, he's simply bad IMO
---
Yeah I would recommend watching the Evil Dead franchise first as it sets up the lore but if you dont have time for that just watch the 2nd and third movie then the main juicy part, the series Ash vs evil Dead. Its a fun series and one of the most entertaining ones I've watched in a while
---
Technically the Entity wants the survivors to have hope cause the Entity feeds off it. If you want to play the game as intended and described in the lore then you would give them hope so you can crush it later. Otherwise you are starving the Entity.
---
Hey, it’s me, OP, survivor main here.
---
Is nurse only good on pc or something? On console it only seems to be Myers. I’ve tried playing her and it seems you need to be somewhere on the spectrum to do well with her
---
So, a more annoying version of the game we have now. Great.
---
Here's another great one... I hit a leatherface with a pallet the other day at the same time he hit another survivor. He got stuck inside the pallet and no matter what, couldn't get unstuck. GG
---
Aim makes it easier on PC
---
*bruh* *man* *oof*
---
You don’t have to turn your character towards him, just the camera. 
---
There’s a sound cue that tells you if your aiming the camera right so if you don’t get that sound cue, keep making small adjustments until you do
---
You are no longer allowed to spend or gain BP.
---
You may as well uninstall, there's nothing left for you here.
---
yea 'cause you shouldn't be able to win against a good swf, or obviously it means there is an issue with the killer balance.
---
Yeah a lot of the time when there is a jojo reference people say "Is that a motherfucking jojo reference!?"
---
TBF No Mither is legit the definition of the worlds most useless fucking perk.
---
What the hell...
---
It's awful.  I am tired of playing survivor and I can't get anything as killer.  I want to play and get my own stash of cakes but I can't deal with this lopsided matchmaking.  I'm going to have to shelve this game and wait for some fixes before I try again, even if it means missing out on the event...
---
So people want a new game mode to change this up, but if you offer an idea it suddenly "a more annoying version of the game..."
---
This is a perfect example of how no matter what BHVR or anyone does, people aren't gonna be happy.
---
I think you are confusing stupid plays and a perk.
---
They are canonically siblings in DBD, as the sibling bit was only removed in Halloween (2018), and these characters were introduced to the game before then.
---
holy shit this is awesome
---
o jfc
---
😂
---
My little brother has just started playing, he was having a rough time against squadets so midway I played for him to help him get more BP. Point being 2 of the Claudets were just raging at my little brother for simply me killing them, despite me not playing as an asshole because I’m a survivor main so I know what not to do.
---
At the time I forgot to turn off messages for him and I just felt bad for my brother because he genuinely thought we did something wrong at the time.
---
omfg its 69 SO FUNNY AHAHAHAHAH 69 YOU SEE? LIKE A SEX POSE AHAHAHAH
---
Fortnite bad...
---
I got yelled at for camping bc all the other survivors were following me to hooks and I downed them all while they all tried to unhook their friend. It’s not my fault you’re stupid?? Same with survivors that unhook themselves instantly. At least give me a chance to leave the area?
---
Y'know, I wanted to let an Ash live yesterday, or at least give them an easier time, but this mother fucker decided to press ctrl in quick succession in front of me. 
---
I had to do it.
---
Bbq stacks and chase points. As killer I try to hook everyone once first. After that I'll kick gens I've found out the more variety of things you do, the more points you get. That goes for both sides. Gen rushing and tunnelling/camping don't net you blood points and for me getting points is enjoyable. I like to pip and rank up.
---
Dead Hard not activating because it isn't even lighting up to use. Self care can't heal, med kit still can't heal. No wiggle bar, sometimes can't heal other survivors, exit gate is opened but when I run thru to escape I just run around outside the map instead. I may have forgot a few that I experience just about every match.
---
You're preaching to a choir man
---
He said it
---
Is it the infinite mending thing or what?
---
It's on his official wiki, but it could have been stayed in a Dev stream
---
Both games are fun, F13 is pretty dead though because no content is being released anymore so I would 100% say DbD
---
These Head On buffs are lookin' good tbh
---
Back at you, maining killer is really fun, survivor's grind feels so much more real honestly.
---
Glad to hear it :)
---
Just bloodpoints.   I love hag and would be more than willing to pay double bloodpoints to get water logged shoes and rusty shakes and the ear because it's hard to get good with a build when you can only run it twice before you gotta grind again.  Flip side I have nurse to 40 for the perk and would gladly sell all her purple and green add ons to someone who mains her
---
why does this post keep getting downvoted...
---
So me getting nearly all unhooks, most of the heals, constantly doing gens, getting chased (hard to tunnel when you can't keep track of the person you're chasing, weird i know), is me being immersed? 
---
So immersion is now used for people hiding in outskirts with UE, and a good team mate. 
---
I literally only play Solo, because SWF destroys any joy in this game to me. 
---
"I take a 30+ second heal perk, because i get tunneled and want to heal mid chase." I mean weird flex, but ok.
---
Iron will, Exaust perk, spine chill, and botany/BT. All directly effect chases. If you can't use Spine chill right, yeah probably seems useless. Iron will literally makes you untraceable by sound if injured. (thats how most killers find you). Botany for incredibly fast heals, and item longevity. BT, sole purpose is to combat tunneling, and it does it a hell of a lot better than selfish-care.
---
Cause it may come of as bragging rights.
---
There’s zero evidence of Drayton, Nubbins, or Chop Top in 3. It’s basically a sequel to the first movie, but losing Drayton and Nubbins.
---
TCM Next Generation was a flat out remake, and a not very good one at that.
---
Hey OP, what outfit is the one you're rocking, and for what survivor?
---
The stature indicates one of the female survivors, but I just checked the Store and none of them have a large coat or fedora hat.
---
Closest would be Adam with his default coat, but he doesn't have a fedora either.
---
They already confirmed its gonna be free
---
You’re a tunneling piece of shit end of discussion.
---
Thanks epic gamer Kakyoin
---
I would just leave, start another one u have a better chance of getting into a game like that than waiting for a 4th like that
---
I saw the same thing on this sub, a ghostface saw someone fail to escape so he guided tgem to the hatch
---
If you think not getting a hit in 40 seconds is playing badly I'd suggest you play against good players. I have an immense amount of respect for good survivors, but that doesn't mean I enjoy playing against them nor does it mean I'm bad. It's generally agreed that for a lot of killers you can only exert your power when a survivor makes a mistake. There are significantly fewer mistakes in red rank.
---
The Next Generation was weird. Same universe, different characters. And the makers of TCM 3 said that Drayton, Nubbins and Paul were related to Tex, Alfredo and Tink.
---
You can replace it with better perks. I don't really see bond being usedul outside of swf
---
He got banned
---
Where on the doll did Maurice touch you?
---
He’s banned here
---
i didnt mean to brag... i just wanted to share what ive achieved over the years. i guess ill just take the post down if it gets more and more downvotes
---
Falling off the map geometry is not an escape.
---
That’s what I just did lmao, you really just read my mind
---
Some guy who commented on every pig post and would only post about the pig
---
What did he get banned for?
---
Oh boy he got whooshed
---
I would rather self care in safety than risk unhooking without any cushion for a insta-down. I will take a hit for you even follow you to heal you or take that hit if the killer tunnels. You are a random, I plan to help but I am gonna look out for myself too cause in my experience other survivors don't do the same for me they just leave me to bleed out on the hook or the ground.
---
This technique of calling a nerf an adjustment doesn't change what it is. I had a dev refer to the legion nerf as a buff in a conversation once. Being disingenuous is both disrespectful and condescending. We're all adults here. Let's call a spade a spade and discuss why the nerfs are truly needed rather than trying to sidestep the conversation.
---
Is this tombstone myers IN the tree?
---
The only change he needs is to be renamed "The Stalker"
---
I started playing Doctor seriously for the first time last night, still learning him obviously. I got a few 4ks with him (at very low ranks, though). I'm proud of myself for that.
---
All I do is run towards the killer or cover the person who just got unhooked until the killer hits me and then the killer just comes after me. I thought the point of this game was to use teamwork to escape.  We already know the killer is gonna go after the injured survivor so why not as a teammate help him out especially if your  healthy.
---
The Wraith. He's invisible, but not TOO invisible, so I have to be on HIGH alert to see his little Predator imprint at all times.
---
Does it get continually worse like before?
---
Saying link /s
---
Think it was brigading and vote manipulation
---
Playing on ps4 its a novelty when you come up against a nurse. My experience as her is that i often get a frame rate drop as she lands her teleport which makes it very hard to hit anyone. I guess the unintended consequence of console players having more variety is nice though
---
More like autohaven
---
Rip framerates on Nurse, Doctor, and Freddy.
---
I usually just play guitar while I'm waiting.
---
Myers for sure. Only killer that still manages to scare me.
---
One that doesn't tunnel or face camp. I don't care to not survive but fuck me for wanting some bloodpoints before I do.
---
Every player can't hit great skill check, so a good change would be for killer to have to sacrifice all hooks within 45 meters of a hex totem.
---
must be fake
---
whats wrong with that?
---
Here is the survivor experience since the last patch
---
Dead Hard not activating because it isn't even lighting up to use. Self care can't heal, med kit still can't heal. No wiggle bar, sometimes can't heal other survivors, vigor does the opposite as it is supposed to, exit gate is opened but when I run thru to escape I just run around outside the map instead. I may have forgot a few that I experience just about every match. All that just to be tunneled and facecamped too. Fun.
---
So choose wisely which side you play.
---
I guess it takes different types of people for both parts! I’m so glad people like you exist haha!
---
Nice! Just started playing killer it's pretty fun!
---
This. I do the same, if he’s about to die and I see at least 4-5 gens left, I’m gonna just down him and give him another chance, cause it wasn’t his fault that he got unhooked right in front of you. I wish they implemented where you can deny a hook save, cause a lot of survivors unhook right next to a killer without borrowed time, you’re just killing me at this point, cause 99% of the time, it’s gonna be me who’s gonna get hooked again.
---
Dead Hard not activating because it isn't even lighting up to use. Self care can't heal, med kit still can't heal. No wiggle bar, sometimes can't heal other survivors, vigor does the opposite as it is supposed to, exit gate is opened but when I run thru to escape I just run around outside the map instead. All that just to be tunneled and facecamped too. Fun.
---
I heard the caption in his voice
---
From what I remember it's because in some languages "The Spirit" and "The Ghost" translate to the exact same thing.
---
Well his power is pretty much useless against somewhat decent survivors if i am completely honest. I saw the video where he talks about the powerrole in DBD and IMO he is 100% right about the whole powerrole thing.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion, but I don't think he should be able to lose his entire power by being looked at. If they keep the reveal mechanic, I think he should still keep his 0 terror radius but disable stalking for like, 20 seconds or so? I personally dont feel he's a good killer in the slightest rn.
---
360d a ghostface about 8 times in a row yesterday and man was it hilarious .
---
Well maybe they were bugged like 67% of survivors matches just pick one
---
I love the new killer! The months leading up to his (or her) release I really lost interest in the game due to people constantly disconnecting, but now.. something has changed and I love DBD again
---
There is a horror game out there called "Escape the Ayuwoki" which has a creature that looks like Michael Jackson and it runs around yelling HEHE while it tries to kill you.
---
Sooo htf does that work? Also, JoJo worth watching?
---
Ghost face is a dude :)
---
How about any of these
---
But lets fix the one bothering killers a little bit.
---
then apparently i dont know what bragging is. didnt mean anything bad with this post. all i wanted to say is ''hey, i love the game, spent quite a lot of time with it and im proud of what i achieved''. ''look what i achieved'' may seem like the definition of bragging to you, but to me it sounds like the definiton of being proud tbh
---
They said they were fixing it but it isn't banable. Massive double standard in my opinion.
---
Defo worth the watch, the best anime I’ve ever seen
---
Oh my God that sounds incredible.
---
Honestly this is one of the better cosmetics I’ve seen so far. I’d love for this to make it to the game!
---
Have you been with the game from the beginning. Cause that's not how it works.
---
They already use resources to create them but okay whatever
---
Why nerf ruin? Gens go too quickly as it is, sometimes ruin is the only thing stopping all the gens being done in four minutes.
---
I completely 100% agree I’m a survivor main and agree with this statement. If not better then nurse all is groovy.
---
It's actually solid.
---
because he isn't staring at him but right beside him at the truck. All he would have had to do was move the camera a bit so he's looking more to the right. Guy even kept staring at the same spot even though he didnt hear the reveal sound. All he had to do was move the camera a bit more to get the reveal sound and THEN keep staring at that spot.
---
I agree it was close and looked like middle of the screen but it simply wasn't.
---
This is a solo killer. There will be no survivor released with it. Not now, not in three months, not in a year. That's not how it works.
---
After dealing with a couple of survivors that were toxic I ran across some survivors that were really kind to me. As a killer main, it's small things like that, that keep me going.
---
Okay
---
I'm glad you're altruistic, so am I. You've never played with me, you dont know. None of the perks add to or take away from that. Whenever I'm not getting chased, I'm doing gens obviously. None of the perks add to or take away from that. 
---
My build is optimized, I've explained it before and the high rank players are the same as me. Feel free to disagree with the meta and do something different, doesnt change that this is the meta... whether you like it or not. If you want to play immersion style, more power to you. You bought the game, play the way you want, but self care is a crutch perk in the game because relying on teammates in a competitive environment is unreliable which means not optimal.
---
Not with this killer my god man I am just saying they will be released. Hoe long was between Ash and Ghost Face?
---
I think "The Wraith" in German is "The Ghost".
---
I'm glad you have fun playing and i hope you'll enjoy your next games too! might get a bit harder on higher ranks but doesnt let that prevent you from having fun :)
---
I mean, I agree.
---
I got downvoted into oblivion but I feel like Killers standard should get 3K easy and standard with 4Ks being absolutely the norm -- Survivors should NEVER get to 1 Generator left if killers were working properly and not nerfed into oblivion.
---
I know I'll get "BUT WE USED TO HAVE ARROW KEYS AND PALLETS"  but please.  Friday the 13th was also a good game at one point, does that mean we should all jerk off to it too?   As it sits right now, Killer should be like Hunter in Deathgarden -- Easy and quick to learn.  But more fun for Killers.
---
Don't forget the Jigsaw Piece and double calm addons.
---
The one with the devil's eyes
---
Yeah I am, I’ve been able to play one game as ghost face and that’s about it :(
---
I believe the bugs in DBD are proof of karma. BHVR doesn't want funny stuff in the game, it's supposed to be scary. So the universe guides the overworked developers to introduce bugs that make the game hilarious.
---
None of that really has to do with what I was asking? It's not the killer's fault of a survivor gets bugged either. The fact is that a killer shouldn't be getting punished for the survivors disconnecting.
---
&gt;Huntress changes the landscape of chasing with her hatchets.
---
This is a good thing, just looping the exact same way in every single game is fucking boring.
---
Survivor main here.
---
Play how you want to play. But if you tunnel, please don't complain about gen rushing because tunneling is not how you apply map pressure and keep survivors off your gens. Especially if the survivor being tunneled is a good looper and his team are efficient.
---
&gt;Here is the survivor experience since the last patch
---
&gt;Dead Hard not activating because it isn't even lighting up to use. Self care can't heal, med kit still can't heal. No wiggle bar, sometimes can't heal other survivors, vigor does the opposite as it is supposed to, exit gate is opened but when I run thru to escape I just run around outside the map instead. I may have forgot a few that I experience just about every match. All that just to be tunneled and facecamped too. Fun.
---
&gt;So choose wisely which side you play.
---
Why are you using bugs in comparison to an intended change?
---
The survivor shouldn't be punished for loading into into a game with all these bugs happening in the same match. But cry all you like about your little issue.
---
Damn that’s a lot of bugs I hope they fix this game, I just recently got back into the game :/
---
I'm saying if you are gonna play survivor then know what shit you are about to step in compared to wait times.
---
They aren't going to release a map and survivor that's related to a whole different chapter down the line. That's just not how it works. And why does Ash matter? He's a separate paragraph with no ties to Ghostface.
---
How? Don't you get tired of playing against Nurse every other game? If all the killers were the same tier then you'd see some variety, which is what this game desperately needs.
---
I want to hate you for this...but I can’t.
---
Not gonna like you hit like a couple of killers that I run when I had a couple of bad games with survivors. I play Billy and Spirit. But on the survivor POV I'd understand the need for variety instead of the standard meta hence why I like to switch it up with ghostface, trapper, clown and wraith. But it does get bothersome when survivors say "Lol gg ez", "sweaty killer" , "why are you so bad at rank (insert rank here)" . Almost making it seem like I should be punished for it. But those 2 out of 5 games I run into.
---
Yes. From.the vids I've seen it eventually gets to a point where you can't do anything.
---
Chilly Billy: I'm about to ruin this man's whole career.
---
Look at how they didn't wait 3 months between them. And why would they waste resources?
---
Which nerfs? The.  . 5 seconds off stalk?
---
Then they would have to nerf nurse, which they will never do
---
That doesnt mean dedicated servers that means theres a lot of people playing killer
---
🖤
---
sure, after they finally changed adrenaline to have a prerequisite per person to proc it or after they dealt with obsession perks on multiple survivors. i.e. making obsession perks less usefull if you are NOT the obsession.
---
No, really?
---
any  update on this? my sounds are still fucked as killer
---
No, I don't think WGLF should be buffed or changed. I think survivor BP gain should be buffed in general, along with deviousness on certain killers.
---
certain SWF groups are the cancer of this game
---
Because they're paragraphs so there's no need to wait forever between them. I can't explain this to you anymore, it's obviously not sinking in.
---
Ah yes
---
You are dumb as a rock if you think they are gonna waste resources.
---
"Billy has a high learning curve"
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH
---
Hmm. Yeah I dunno how that works.
---
Who uses Plunderer's Instinct without Ace in the Hole?
---
What the hell are they wasting resources on? They are not adding a map or survivor related to the ghostface chapter later on. That's. Not. How. It. Works.
---
Will the Pig isn't really a pig and the Shape isn't a shape, they don't have to have a super literal name.
---
It absolutely does incite killers, but if I can waste more of their time, I feel like it's worth it for my team. I was going to be hooked anyway, now I've just kept their attention longer.
---
As someone who likes ghostface more, I fully understand that Myers would just pick him up and bash his head in until he's done.
---
Have they restated that this is an issue? From the killer's standpoint he can't really see this so he has to be told about it.
---
FACTS

First I saw a dbd post on r/ShitPostCrusaders , and now it's Jojo on r/deadbydaylight ? What a bizarre day.
---
Yeah. MoM definitely needed a change. The change that was on the PTB sounded like a good change, but they decided to nerf it into oblivion. 
---
In the same way, GF’s detection is really hit or miss. I’m even saying this as a GF main. Just hoping bhvr doesn’t over nerf him if they make any further changes.
---
Show me a screenshot of you playing against 4 red ranks and getting a 4K with Ghost Face. If you even play killer at red ranks at all.
---
Ah, a fellow man of culture, I see.
---
I'll let her know! Thank you!!
---
But he isn't wrong, killers are genuinely fucking weak. 
---
Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Huntress. 
---
There have fun. 
---
Powerful SWF? Nurse is your choice have fun. 
---
I want more variety at high ranks like this meme says.
---
Thank you, I didn't feel like arguing over something that is quite obvious.
---
Thats where you're wrong, kiddo. Decisive Strike took two years, and even then, it's still a good anti tunneling perk. And they changed enduring to make.it even better. The only survivor perk that was nerfed quickly was Mettle of Man, and that's because it was ridiculous. Free endurance for getting stabbed in the ass 3 times. Sounds balanced.
---
I think you're one of the few that agree with me lol
---
Jeez, now I got splinters in mouth...
---
Pffft.. pfftt...
---
Did he though? Ilisnt his story just a stalker killer? Remember that this is NOT Scream
---
I was simply pointing out that your response didn't have much to do with the issue I raised. What's with the unwarranted hostility? 
---
Obviously survivors shouldn't have to deal with bugs, but plenty of survivors DC whether they encountered bugs or not. It's not fair on the other survivors and it's not fair on the killer if they lose a rank because of it.
---
Judging by the way you are replying, I can only assume you are exactly the type of survivor that disconnects as soon as they game isn't going your way.
---
1) its exaggerated
---
2) Anti-tunneling, more like delays the inevitable. 
---
3) MeTtLe Of MaN oP. NeRf WaS nEeDeD.
---
Yes the third year stream had a section saying they are going to punish disconnects after dedicated servers are out, as it's easier to tell if it was intentional or the game just DCing them.
---
Thats a loooooot of BPs...
---
Awesome Man you make us killer mains proud
---
Wake Up has made the game so much fun. They would be wise to make the change permanent.
---
Pog, fuck off, i cant enjoy the game if im ranked against rank 5s, and also, the wait times contribute to this too, i wait half an hour to get into a game and this is what i get
---
half the pallets have been removed from every map. Generator spawns have been placed in more and more unsafe/open areas. The meta is geared to just never being found rather than being skilled in running the killer around. I always played the game for the chase and now chasing is just a shell of gameplay from what it once was.
---
Ash has already fought Freddy hasn't he? I dont remember what happened in the comic.
---
I was refering to him blaming entitled survivor mains.  
---
I basically only play killer and I agree with the person who posted this thread. I was just stating the dude i responded to is being a toxic jerk. You can make a good point but have wrong reasons for coming to that point and still be correct even if your base for that point is laughable.
---
Absolutely beautiful.
---
Some debbie downers lurk in New section i guess, but dont worry a good post always gets upvoted!
---
Lmao we are all getting bugs not just me and you said killers shouldn't be punished cause the survivors leave while I said survivors shouldn't be punished by being forced to stay in a bugged match. 
---
I will happily loop you for 5 gens if you are on ps4.
---
Congrats! That is a huge accomplishment on ps4! Gonna get that 4K in no time!
---
If you look at the top of my head and move to the tree, you can see the tip of his knife
---
We needed pre-rework Freddy to keep Quentin sleep deprived...post-rework, despite being stronger gameplay wise, won’t have the specialised skills in tunnelling Quentin
---
You joked about Nea being the Entity, but who do you think created the Entity...
---
Except they didnt nerf it. They said that the number is lower, but somehow it shortens the stun to exactly 1 second down from 2. That is shorter than before. They also just made it so its only pallet stuns, which makes sense.
---
They didn't even have time to complain, the nerfs were announced the day of his release.
---
This sounds like a game I was in recently. Were you playing as gf? Do you remember the survivors name? With all the disconnects I was just focusing on getting out of the match alive.
---
Sure, I don't mean I have a schedule or anything.  But usually when I decide I really want to play I'll sit with it for hours.  I just use lobby time to mess around with riffs I've already written
---
People didn't get banned when the sloppy butcher bug was going around awhile back either. But hopefully it gets fixed sooner than it took for that one. I'm mostly a survivor main and refuse to abuse a broken perk. It's just not cool to run.
---
Are you just copypastaing this into every new post
---
Yeah just got to green rank and it's pretty hard lol still learning ;)
---
You too have knows loss. And that loss torments you still.
---
Did I touch a nerve?
---
What are some good Killers for beginners btw?
---
I haven't had the game kill me once on hook since I switched the keybind to mousewheel. I really can't recommend it enough.
---
If you are looking for an actual answer, because it falls under "oversaturated content." If everyone posted every time they prestiged everyone, got a perfect game, completed achievements, etc, the sub would be inundated with content that is largely only interesting to the individual that accomplished it. It's like if everyone posted pictures of their motorcycles on r/motorcycles--you love it because it's yours, but it is just another motorcycle to everyone else. 
---
But, to be fair to you and others posting similar content, there isn't really a proper megathread for "oversaturated content" either.
---
Every post that has a killer bitching about whatever they think is an issue like complaining about disconnections, wake up, or "toxic survivors"
---
To be fair, Billy at a high level has significantly more counterplay than say Nurse or Spirit.
---
Are you stupid? ALL bugs need to be patched, OP however is asking about this particular bug. Gens are being completed at around 9 seconds and that's with just one survivor lmao, watch cowsIam vid on it. It's hilariously broken now imagine with just 2, don't even want to think about 4 being on one lol. Those particular bugs you listed while they may be there (I personally haven't experienced any issue with dead hard or medkits) this wake up bug takes effect 100% of the time unlike at the very least the dead hard one and medkit/self care one clearly are inconsistent bugs considering I've yet to run into it.
---
Petition for party hat Laurie!
---
He is A shape
---
I guess you should use NOED and get that clutch save lol
---
RZ Laurie isn’t the one in the game. The one in the game is 1978 Laurie.
---
Playing anyone that moves fast (Billy, Nurse, Spirit,  ect) really takes a toll on the FPS. Not to mention console has a FPS cap already so the frames aren't good to begin with. Lol
---
if people stop thinking a simple hotfix is a huge nerf than it will be fine.
---
It's only a recent thing. Killer matchmaking used to be instantaneous until a bit over a week ago when they deployed the new system. Hopefully it's just temporary and they revert back before scrapping any changes they were planning.
---
That's kinda stupid just make your own post like every other survivor in the history of this game, and literally everything is bugged this patch more survivor stuff than killer but that doesnt make it invalid. It isnt a competition for who has more bugs.
---
I mean...Amanda already got shot in the neck, so...
---
Ah that's good to hear. Thanks for answering
---
I definitely feel like the pig is one. Not only because of how painful the reverse bear traps are to wear but also the intense panic and fear you would feel when wearing one, especially if you try to get it off (in which your hands seem to get cut to shreds in doing so) and it doesn't work .... //shudders
---
I did. I posted on the friday bug report. I didn't clog the subreddit with another post about a bug. But keep replying please.
---
I was playing as Leatherface. Can't honestly remember the names of the survivors though, but maybe that was the same game!
---
If you scroll over a killer, it should have a difficulty thing at the top. Good beginner killer are trapper, hillbilly, and leatherface.
---
imagine playing a top tier killer with great add-ons and dc just because a survivor juke you twice 🤦‍♀️
---
Just dont keep commenting it then. It still clogs the subreddit
---
The only Myers buff I need is a corn harvester.

I think you forgot to put /s
---
I bet this dude its the average one that says shit after the match chat haha
---
Yeah, it's really sad. I've gone to message killers I've enjoyed playing against and 9 times out of 10, messages are disabled.
---
It’s not a nerf. The stun is longer than before because not it’s a flat 50%. Before the stun with enduring brought the duration down from 2 seconds to 1.14 seconds. Now it brings it down to a flat 1 second. If you read the patch notes it explains it all
---
I don't play Pc but nice try
---
I don't want to prestige some killers bc i have old offerings that i can't get anymore :c
---
The reveal mechanic seems pretty inconsistent, but I think the stalking mechanic is working as intended. It's hard to filter through the complaints about him because most people don't understand how it works. To anyone reading this: His progress stalking you stays on you until you are exposed, your progress revealing him does not. Looking at him does not halt his progress stalking you. If you lose line of sight on him it resets. He can 99% you like Myers, and then insta-stalk you later. Your own character model can obstruct your vision of him.  
---
The real problem is that sometimes you can't reveal him when he is clearly visible. Other times your still revealing him when he runs behind a wall. The detection for stalking on Ghost Face and Myers seems to work fine, so I'm not sure why revealing is causing a problem.
---
Hey dude let me tell you something do you have a PS4
---
Ummm... plague is thousands of years old... don’t think a bullet does shit
---
Because this game is just full of BM. It sucks but that's just the way it is.
---
I'm mostly sick of ghostface and hag. Most just face or long distance camp when they catch you. Plus so many hags abuse the traps it's ridiculous.
---
Probably wasn't me then. I usually do poorly against leatherface. I can usually evade them until there is only one or two gens left then they always find me and I'm done. I'm rank 11 but still not great at evading the killer once found. Don't know how people pull off 360s.
---
That's not necessarily a basis for collusion. 
---
*A lot* of killers purposefully slug the third person to bait the fourth person out or to just allow them a better chance of getting the 4K. 
---
I personally think it's annoying as hell but a valid tactic regardless.
---
It’s like when survivors wait at the gat for 5 plus minute when they can escape just because they want to tbag or have the killer watch them leave. The game is full of bm and I don’t think that will change any time soon.
---
They need to fix all of these broken perks sooner rather than later. They're ruining a lot of games right now. At least disable them in the time being if they don't know what broke them.
---
What about any of these following bugs that effect killers? Getting stuck inside pallets that drop on you in four different locations on Gideon, if your already in a stun. Nurse losing second blink randomly for no reason. Billy chainsaw causing you to bounce off objects and go into orbit. Pig headtrap just not killing the survivor something like 1/20th of the time. Legion losing frenzy after hitting a no mither Target. Plague consuming a well but not getting the buff. Clown reloading bottles only for the game to lag at the last part and having to redo it. Getting stuck in the locker opening animation. Survivors getting stuck on top of lockers or other out of reach areas. Infinite loops. Not to mention, literally a million client side visual bugs. Basically anytime an effect happens on your screen, there's a one in five it'll be broken. The game is buggy as fuck, but wake-up is an exploitable bug, whereas the others are just random occurances. Get over yourself you ochido wannabe
---
There are so many perks that are broken with this update, some that we are still learning about that are doing things similar to what wake up is doing. I’ve even heard thanatophobia is bugged but killers are still using it. Either way, this is all stuff that wasn’t part of the update at all and is literally only the devs fault. They need to get on fixing things right away.
---
That’s really good.
---
Who am I trying to be? I would like to know because in order for me to succeed I must know who they are.
---
I'd prefer it of you called her Amanda Young not pig /s
---
The killer is going for a 4k. See, if he immediately hooks that 3rd survivor, the you, the 4th and last, have a good chance to find the hatch (obviously you already did, but he doesn't know that).
---
So, he leaves the 3rd on the ground to come find you. At least that's what I do with the last two. 
---
The goal being to have one on the ground, then find you and hit you twice, then go and hook you both. No hatch possibility.
---
Who is your favorite p3 appearance wise. Mine is freddy.
---
I don’t know why you guys think the game is not optimized. I’ve recently acidentally used my integrated videocard (Intel HD Graphics) instead of GTX 1080 Ti. I did not give even notice this until I launched another game, DbD perfectly ran at 60FPS at Ultra.
---
I still think CPU might be your bottleneck, but in terms of graphics optimization, the game has done huge progrsss already.
---
As in the killer left the second last person in the dying state? It’s a tactic used to secure a 4K because it drastically increases the amount of time the killer has to find the last survivor before the hatch opens, that’s not BM
---
Not really lol. Its literally the game as it is now, just with more chores.
---
I've always been fond of "The Spectre" sounds like a fun killer
---
I hate getting the same perk lvl after lvl!! I skipped you and let the entity get you cause you suck and I don't want you!!! Give me what I want!!!!
---
Kills are only one part of a category. Hooks are also a part of that category. You can get way more points by maximizing the amount of hooks you can get rather than minimizing them by tunneling one person when you could have gotten someone new and started a new flood of hooks. It’s a snowball effect. Use hooks to get more hooks on altruistic fools. You win in the end because you’ll get more points and the survivors will be on gens less the more pressure you apply.
---
But YOU weren’t behind an object, the survivor was, and survivors have 3rd person perspective. This would have enabled one of them to centre you on their screen and knock you out of Stealth. You didn’t even make an attempt to hide either.
---
I haven't ran into them yet, speaking on the dead hard, healing, and exit gate ones in particular. I'm not saying they're not their lmao I'm just saying they're obviously not consistent especially to how wake up is 100% consistent. I've no issue with it lol and I don't run noed, you are the one clearly irate and hurt with the ''b-but these bugs are more!" Lmao it isn't a competition, ALL bugs should be patched go cry elsewhere ;)
---
I think he's great. There's times I've gone against him  and had my ass whopped. But then times where we've completely destroyed him with completed generators. It's all about who's playing him. That goes for all killers.
---
Started as a survivor main. He ain’t OP.
---
This post is like saying there are not many toxic people on LoL....are you serious right now? prob 70% of the playerbase on DBD that players survivor is toxic as fuck. I play both sides. so unless you play both sides equally and have suffered on each side your opinion means precisely...dick
---
I brought a mori and after I got them all hooked in the basement one of them kobed and unhooked everyone, then we each took selfies together. Good times.
---
Blow it out your arse hole allen einsteind
---
Man some people, myself included, have hundreds, if not thousands of hours put into this game.
---
You get sick of the meta and would rather try to make use of shitty perks like windows of opportunity or wakeup, smallgame and whatnot.
---
I myself use perkwheels often when I play survivor. I'd rather play with 4 shitty perks and try to force myself to make use of them than play meta perks every game jfc
---
What a wonderful little writeup, this is so cute! I love how much thought was put into this. Also, holy shit I need to see Ash fight Freddy.
---
Yeah apparently he fought Freddy and Jason in a comic and managed to win by using the Necronomicon to banish Freddy to hell as well as Jason.
---
No one escapes...
---
But Wake up only activates when all gens are done or the hatch is closed, so the bug only advantage the survivors in the end game ?
---
Mephahuum Dingir Okuva!
---
I would but your mom is blowing me right now so I can't. Her weight won't let me move.
---
Unless it's a very complex character then it's usually one or two characteristics you possess, and then playing a character as if those are the only characteristics they have. Bruce is a smart guy but I'm sure that he can be a bit of an overconfident doof sometimes like Ash.
---
The Survivors have cover,My attempt was  I moving to the right where they can't see me in the first clip while they were trying to take me out but even then they were able to take me out while behind a tree.
---
i finally prestiged  feng :’)
---
Imagine downing someone and watching them bleed out for 4 minutes. I play killer and survivor a lot and never understood those kinds of plays, even face camping (except for last guy). I also never do it cause I'm not gonna spam cntrl over and over for 4 minutes so theres that. Giant waste of time,  at least when a survivor tags his teammates are getting objectives done.
---
They certainly should fix it, and hand out a warning as they did with dual blades, or disable it outright. But banning the abusers is absolutely right on their part. Its still their choice to abuse it.
---
Niiiiiiiice good job sport
---
Oh god it does!!
---
JoJo's is an amazingly weird mix of silly seriousness. But it's also packed with great amounts of good story telling, and tension.
---
I’m okay with that actually. Line of sight (ie them making eye contact) being a requirement would give ghostfsce a free hit regardless
---
I don’t know why but I expected Africa to start playing
---
Monstrous shrine would have a word with you.
---
where the hell's bill?
---
you can't have a senior citizen edition of dead by daylight without the crankiest old man in the game
---
no, i juust hv the starter survivors, i spend all my money with killers and shrone of secrets, i just use claudette
---
If you’ve ever realized the entity AND the devs actually want you to apply more pressure to survivors. What I mean is trying to injure the entire team instead of just going after one person and finishing them off immediately. 
---
Just look at the malicious category. I’m not just saying this is what applying pressure is, the category states that it wants you to apply pressure by injuring multiple survivors. You get emblem points for it. And what are emblems representative of? How well you played that match.
---
Is tunneling effective? I don’t personally think so. Does it make you a better killer? Clearly not when the game encourages playing NOT like a tunneling killer. If you go after the person that was just unhooked then you are not taking the opportunity to apply more pressure to the entire team than just one person until they are dead. It’s clear that’s how the devs intended people to play not just for the own killers sake, but for the sake of he survivors fun as well
---
The scene with the public toilet used to shit the life out of me as a kid lol
---
I love Candyman
---
i dont hv ash so... maybe a bug
---
I'm lost.  Please explain.
---
Angrypug
---
Yeah I don’t think a glock is stopping him anytime soon
---
i love how defensive killers get when something is in their favor but bitched and moaned about dstrike til they ruined it
---
Nice.
---
Then it could be another survivor using Ash. He is the only survivor with voicelines
---
Whats your playtime?
---
I don't know, haven't finished a single game against that
---
Monstrous shrine is 3 worst killer perk
---
Old DS was very strong and this new DS is arguably stronger because you can’t reduce the stun, but go off.
---
I thought the data was stored on their servers so you couldn’t do that? Or is it different on PC?
---
it isnt, it's a bug, when 2 ppl in the trial have the same name. Happens every game, when someone is downed / hooked / deep wounded :)
---
Because it's usually a bad idea to max out when the game throws you plenty of opportunities to level up and get cool stuff , or unique items, along the way, maybe? 
---
I'm not defending the downvotes, which I can't detect, but there were a lot of complaints about needing to level up a bunch just to get X item/offering/progress during events. 
---
There is no real point in trying to max out in a game that will always have more expansions and characters, unless you are going to follow the meta forever and never deviate.
---
Anyways, some people show disapproval with a down vote, it doesn't mean anything, they are just lazy with giving a signal to caution.
---
Right. People are just asking for his reveal and stalk to be fixed....sometimes its easy, and sometimes I stare directly at him and nothing happens. And sometimes I don’t even see him and hes revealed. 
---
People are also wanting more top tier killers. I am okay with that, but only if its met with skill requirement. And to me, Ghost Face isnt of the same skill level of a good hillbilly or nurse 🤷🏼‍♂️. So why should he be of same power and map control? It doesnt make sense.
---
Sale p***
---
almost to p3 on ghostface :)
---
I know.
---
that was a "murica dumb" joke
---
What were all the changes again?
---
I'm fine with them making it a tiny bit easier to break GF out of stealth.
---
Hey! Its me! OP! I’m a survivor main
---
makes sense to me, if it doesnt work in the killers favor then it gets nerfed
---
If you're talking about not escaping but going off the map.
---
It happened to me like 1.5 year ago when i was starting to play this game.
---
so definitely not a recent bug.
---
We need some Keanu Reeves mentality
---
MoM was OP though. In fact it only further exacerbated the use of Billy and Nurse and Huntress because they could work around it more often than not. 
---
Sadly they never added in the Safe Unhook requirement so now it’s just Terri-bad.
---
I play both but they massacred my boy
---
The second clip, seemed like you were exposed from the left. Not in front of you?
---
Spirit, Nurse, Billy.  That’s it.  Every other killer gets gen rushed and pallet looped then tea bagged at the exit gate.  They don’t have enough power to end chases quickly or exert map pressure.  Huntress is good on ~40% of maps, but obv most of the time she is bad because of the map rng not because of her power.  To deny this all is anything but fact is just wrong, I used to think that you just need to play better but it’s just a matter of fact.  I speak from experience as playing Wraith, Trapper, and Doctor a lot; wraith and Doctor triple prestiged.
---
This is about the console versions not pc. PC is fine but they said console would get 60
---
New DS is perfect
---
Or “The Face”
---
After some super bad matches my final Bloodhunt match was with a Ghostface letting us farm.
---
Thanks dude, I needed that.
---
Like others have said, he gets the most viewers when he plays DbD so probably doesn't want to miss out the potential and extra £££ from getting it. The downside of streaming imo if you're not considered a variety streamer you can get stuck playing a game you don't really like.
---
cant be a real survivor main then :)
---
It does seem to be a strategy for some killers.  Just sit back and watch and once noed activates then its killing time.
---
I played an Insidious clown the other day and we got the genies up relatively fast with no real issue.  He did manage to off a rando that decided to dc on first hook but such is life.
---
Once we got the last genie up though man he became a killing machine lol.  Maybe we were lulled to sleep because of his inactivity for most of the match but once noed activated it was all over.
---
We did it. We reached the pinnacle of meme.
---
Is their any real benefits to prestige?
---
hahaa
---
r/gatekeeping over fair balance for a previously OP perk, sounds like you’re just a baby
---
Ignore his bendy legs 😂
---
happened on ps4 with my buddy 😐
---
I *think* they're all *enhanced* to some capacity. Of course, the entity gives them their powers, but I think it also increases their strength, could be wrong.
---
Exactly this. Doctor main here and I run both Distressing and BBQ, so I need all 4 hooked for my stacks, and I need to drag the match out to maximize BPs.
---
That's my ultimate goal in any match. That said, I won't refuse an opportunity to put the team at a disadvantage by being a man down early, especially if they haven't found Ruin yet, as this gives me as the Killer a pretty big advantage for the remainder of the match.
---
I don't specifically tunnel though. If I have them in my sights, then they'll get chased. But, my general rule of thumb is go after the survivor that unhooked to get them hooked first for my BBQ stacks, not the freshly unhooked survivor.
---
My method usually gets me 28k-30k and 3 or 4 kills, and generally speaking, no shit posts afterwards.
---
i was trying to make a joke, sounds like you take this shit way to seriously
---
*too
---
Why did you sell his p***?
---
I'd be ticked if you sold my p*** too!
---
when you have nothing left of value to say so you correct grammar. lol and you called me a baby.
---
sorry i upset you
---
Tbh i base my opinions on killers on how fun they are to play as and/or against
---
People need to understand that console DbD and PC DbD are two completely different animals.

They are making the exposing area a bit bigger so its easier to reveal him. And they are fixing some of the add ons. 
---
In my opinion, this is the bare minimum that needs to be done, but it will be fine for now I guess. I want to see how it plays out.
---
If you think Monstrous shrine is better than unrelenting, you are crazy. Ms is the number 1 worst perk across both sides.
---
I'm Jewish and you should really read the sub rules, anti-Semitic slurs is definitely against them. As far as I can tell, you're trying to be an annoying troll and succeeding. People's problem with the bugs is the last time there was a game breaking bug that was exploitable, legions mend, people got banned in droves. But now there won't be any bans because it's a survivor pek
---
Deja Vu? Beast of Prey? Territorial Imperrative?
---
I've nearly got 10 of my killers fully prestiged. Of course, I don't just get them to prestige 3, I prefer getting the build I want on them as well. 
---
*sigh* this game is such a grind.

Tbh, I would put unrelenting on the pig only if it applied to her dash. To bad it doesn't affect abilities anymore thanks to machine gun builds.

"The Headline"
---
Wake Up is broken as it now completes gens 15% faster, tea bag for t bagging obviously and flashlight swf probably. Then after all that toxicness the survivor asks why the killer had a mori and noed
---
ya know despite everything, despite all the pallet and window loops, despite all the gen rushing, despite all the tea bagging at the gate.
---
I still make an effort to play fairly, to avoid camping and tunneling, to give everyone a chance to win; yes I still rage when I spend five minutes chasing down a single survivor while everyone else gets gens done, but with every failure I learn more about how to beat them, how to get around loops, what behaviors and strategies to avoid with which killers, and I git gud because I don't want to have to rely on cheap strategies to win. It's also why I try to avoid pallet looping killers as a survivor and instead try to out maneuver them around walls and through windows because I know that I would rather lose a survivor who outsmarted me over one who simply used cheap tricks to waste my time.
---
now toxic builds on the other hand like hillbilly's instasaw or huntress' machine hatchets or doctor's worldwide terror radius, those are a whole new ballgame.
---
Lobbies glitch like that. You never find a 4th. Just close it and make a new one.
---
The survivors are being toxic by teabagging and flash lighting the killer and using Wake Up, which is broken right now because it adds 15% speed of just about every action (including fixing gens). In turn, the killer runs his own toxic build with a mori and No One Escapes Death.
---
You completely ignored the "3rd person perspective" part of what that person had said....smh

The Ghost Face: Oh? You'd rather approach me than flee?

Me: I can't ~Kick your ass~ break you out of stealth without getting closer.

Had a friend in another Discord complaining about toxic SWF and then asking why these types of people are surprised when Killers equip Moris and NOED. This meme was made mostly for them but I also posted it on this sub.
---
Crouching does not equal stalking. His power works independently from the crouch. What’s more than likely happening is him crouching is breaking line of sight, which does stop survivors from breaking is power and is intended.
---
they could call it the blood roulette!

Dude nice!
---
Fuck more memes, there’s way too many of them as is
---
It's not attached to anything...
---
As a Plague main I love when survivors don’t cleanse, it makes the game easy for me since I always bring Black Incense (which is a counter to survivors who don’t cleanse) and a apple. I get to snowball everyone and get called toxic post game but hey you didn’t cleanse so thanks! As for her needing a rework I think she’s fine, in fact she’s probably the most balanced killer in the game. Only thing I would recommend is to boost her movement speed when holding vile or corrupt purge.
---
Is it just me, or does it seem really hard to actually dodge a hit using lockers now?
---
I would honestly prefer if Behavior went for the Riot Games / League of Legends approach and flat out disabled certain perks / characters that were causing gameplay issues. I understand that it might make some people upset but better to make a couple of people unhappy that they can't play their favorite character / use their favorite perk than make tons of people unhappy as exploiters ruin their games.
---
I think it could also be because since the mask was all they could get, I imagine they wanted to be able to play up any association they could. You keep the mask but lose the name, you lose 50% of the only brand association they're even allowed to have
---
They wouldn't have to, they could just buff the others to be closer to her level. That would be enough for players to start picking other killers, even if Nurse is still the strongest.
---
There is already a hit fix that they wanted to be part of the initial release but it didn't get added. Atm he can continuously tap to stalk while chasing to keep the timer from ever going down, so an infinite expose atm. That and there are slightly loosening up the current "circle" to reveal him.
---
He didnt spam tho he was just active
---
Don't bring TI into this! That perk at least does something. It can lead to a guaranteed hook for some killers like huntress and helps with hags basement game stopping those crouch bois
---
Ah okay. Yeah, I'm fine with those changes.
---
The thing with GF is that it he gets nerfed, it will take far more skill to play him effectively than for the survivors to counter him. Survivors being able to wreck his whole shop will make it increasingly difficult to learn how to play him effectively, and eventually he'll barely be played. Making him more difficult to play while making it easier for the survivors to play against shifts the power to survivors and leaves the killer without much of a chance.
---
You see, but that's only the one Ghostface. Assuming this isn't the supernatural killer MM and just the super determined human from the original Halloween, he's gonna get stabbed by 1+ *more* Ghostfaces while attacking the primary Ghostface.
---
That's a nightmare fuel type of shit
---
No it doesn't, decisive strike is still a perk that everyone uses
---
Whenever I’ve tried it I’m guaranteed a map 90% of the time.
---
They should just take out the option to leave the game. It would be pretty stupid to punish players who are just using a mechanic the devs put in the game on purpose. I am not saying that DCing is OK but you can't put the option to leave the game in the game and then punish the players for using it.
---
It’s Ash. My friends and I all randomly hear his voice when starting/joining a lobby from the main menu on xbox (usually during the black transition screen), regardless of whether anyone is playing him or not. Sometimes it’ll stop for a few days, but it usually comes back again.
---
Of course they did. That’s the name of the actual character
---
You meant to say "love it when the end game was programmed poorly"?
---
For real. Run across survivors running adrenaline, flashlights and at the end of the game they always complain saying "omg why ate you using crutch perks, bruh you have to be so bad to run such a stupid perk, Lol sweaty killer". Its rather annoying with those type of people
---
Oh and here is some reading material 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirteenth_Tribe
---
That name would be perfect honestly lol.
---
In regards to detection, yes. In regards to balance, no. MOM was OP as fuck the way it was released, GF was the literal opposite of OP
---
It does make sense, as having a perk that counters a anti tunneling perk is stupid. That makes the stun 2.5 seconds, making it basically spirit fury without enduring, therefore basically a free hit. If you get D striked you deserve it.
---
This is my best suggestion because it’s the only way I’ve gotten better at playing survivor; play killer. Play a killer like trapper so you don’t have to worry about fancy skills, and just study how survivors run and use different loops. 
---
Granted if you just got the game yesterday you won’t be going up against very skilled survivors, but it’ll give you a feel for how quickly a killer can close distances and what’s a safe loop vs an unsafe loop
---
Bloodwebs be like:
---
What is wrong with Thanatophobia? I am using it on clown but don't want to if its actually bugged.
---
Kinda cheesed it, fully recovered and when a teamate was nearby i dropped off and they got me back up.
---
Well I can definitely understand that. Precision hasn’t exactly been bhvr’s strong suit
---
I would imagine it stacks. I mean Lf/Billy’s chainsaw charging movement speed/activation speed are increased, so I don’t see why not.
---
Yea there’s a bug rn with the plague that f your using her power right as a the game ends it crashes
---
But it's lower TR in chase when the person ur chasing knows ur chasing anyway...  
---
I try to use different perks but I can't think about any usage of this perk :/
---
No. It is active at all times.
---
bless you
---
It's a bug if you puke with plague right as the match is ending it crashes had it happen to me as well and looked it up on here and saw people talking about it. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
Thats because pig crouches like she is sitting on a dildo. Ghostface tbag is an epic mechanic that I will continue to use on salt machines like you.
---
Every time. He brings me good luck. And as a killer I walk over and nod at him or place a Hag trap by him just so he knows he’s a good boy.
---
While you are correct remember that "The Shape," or Michael Myers, is referenced as the shape in the credits of the Halloween franchise until they began experimenting with his backstory. The same applies to ghost face in the movies. To call him anything else would be weird. Why reinvent the wheel and come up with a new name when it's already been laid out in front of you?
---
Pig main big brain oink
---
Lmao I’ve never played PC but yeah controllers are just harder. Especially nurse, the first few games were traumatic I seriously considered suicide at some point with all the teabagging and flashlight clicks
---
Freddy is always at the bottom lmao even when its a good thing

Wow that would be annoying thanks for the response
---
It's good seeing a new huntress player. No one ever picks her up cause shes hard to play and isnt nurse. You can do it. I believe in you.
---
 Well said. But i would like to add some things.
---
 First and foremost - revealing.  I understand that survivors should be able to counter his ability. But THAT should only apply to survivors ON FOOT. The other survivors, that have been either slagged or hooked shall not interfire with GF ability. It is ridicilous that after hanging or downing survivor i have to hide from them in order to keep the "night shroud" active. 
---
  And the second - for a killer that relies on stealth SO much, 1st persom view doesn't fit this kind of playstyle. Survivors get more of a field of view to observe surroudings. So it's harder to hide from them with 1st person view.  
---
The Pig has an additionol powers beyond steath crouch. And Mayers can keep stalking despite being seen. So they're relatively fine with 1st person view. But for GF staying hidden is crusial, and once he is revealed - all his powers are gone for whole 30 seconds. Like.. He turns into M1 killer without ANY abilities whatsoever.
---
I read the whole thing and I love it! &lt;3
---
How much did you sell his p\*\*\* for?
---
Wazzuuuuuuuuuuuup!!!!!!! 😝
---
1 survivor
---
That's not a valid argument because you can't differenciate who is DCing with what reasoning. Just because you DC on times a week doesn't mean that your brownies are burning or sum shit. If there is a mechanic the Devs put into the game that is meant to be there people are gonna use it. People getting banned for using double blade legion completely validated becuase they are obviously abusing a bug. But the 'Leave Match' button is not a bug.
---
Yesssss totally agree
---
oink
---
Cool thanks.  Just because I just got park to level 50 but its a chore waiting for perks I have bought to show up in bloodlines, was thinking of prestiging so I can get my perk set quicker.
---
Still harder than playing survivor.
---
Bro.... Michael Myers is definitely a shape
---
That can also be an add-on issue. Drivers license and detailed victims routine (?) can substantially decrease the range to reveal him.
---
It isnt. But just about every multiplayer game ever has a way to leave a game. They also only punish you if you do it often. I dont care if they still rage quit I just care if it's only once in a while. DCs are already way better since they started canceling 3 man lobbies. If they start punishing people for leaving multiple games then it will be even better.
---
Oh I didn’t know that. Thats good information actually.
---
i think ash has a way bigger chance to take leatherface down because ash is way more smarter than leatherface, ash has some (if barely) fighting knowledge while leatherface know nothing but swinging his saw and if ash dosent have his saw i still think as long as ash has his robotic hand he still would have a bigger chance of winning. he could hold off leatherface's saw and hell possibly even stop it with that hand and if it was one on one with out chainsaws  ash would fuck up bubba. i think leatherface would be a C tier tbh 
---
with weapons 9-10
---
without weapons 7-10
---
Only shards, player level and some other stuff are stored on their servers. Bps and character progress are saved on your pc
---
I don't mean this in an insulting way I just wan't you to know that you are SUPER wrong about the game being in killers favor all the time. That being said at low ranks it really does feel that way. My suggestion (and this goes with any PvP game) is try playing the other side and find out what annoys you the most then get back and do that annoying thing.
---
For example try playing killer and you might find that its really annoying when you can't ever find anybody. Now as a survivor you know that the second you hear the killers heart beat to get into hiding and don't come out until you know the killer is gone. Remember as a survivor you leave behind scratch marks when you run that the killer can see but you  cant see as a survivor so even if the killer doesn't see you running he will see that you just ran through the area. You will also learn how important your 3rd person camera is for running loops and out running the killer.
---
My other suggestion is to just keep playing. At ranks 20-13 some of the survivors are REALLY REALLY bad and are super afraid to do anything and get caught really fast. once your at ranks 12-5 it can be a hit or miss with teammates but for the most part they will be able to handle their own with some minor slip ups. Ranks 4-5 bully the killer and laugh at them while the killer runs around and screams as they are hit in the face with pallets.
---
Been a while since I've played. Did they nerf the doctor?
---
Oh I know. If you read my past comments you will see that killers are downvoting and arguing with me. I still had some of that energy with me when I commented but I main Ash and Pig, I want both sides fixed. Survivor gets so many of them all in the same match while the only one that effects every killer each match is the potential of someone using Wake Up.
---
Drop urban for balanced landing and you're all set, that's an amazing perk build.
---
Reminds me of the time I was running Save the Best for Last and the Obsession complained about being chased too much. I was Doctor and whenever I found them I'd literally just zap them to Tier 3 and then leave them alone.
---
I would definitely say that a beast formed from a torture victim who was starved and slowly flayed over course of weeks or months who then twisted her body and mind with black magic into what is essentially a wendigo in order to wreak her bloody revenge on her captures is more evil than a woman who kills because she doesn't understand the concept of death.
---
Bruh
---
Seems like there are plenty of killers in the red ranks who managed to get there with the four perk slots they are given. Maybe you just belong at the rank you're at.
---
but noed isn't a bug
---
The lower terror radius (especially if you mix with M&amp;A) doesn't serve you in a chase; terror radius perks never did. They help you close the gap before the survivor even realizes you're there. 
---
That's why you'd ideally use this perk for obsession swapping while the terror radius is a nice passive.
---
You do know that 3 minutes games were literally normal a year ago. It's gotten less but gens are still getting done too fast but the devs refuse to increase gen repear time. Instead they decide to make 10 different perks to counter gen"rushing".
---
Ps4 Pro is looking fine as of now. And i have noticed some improvements on PS4 and Xbox one (not the upgraded versions) lately. So they are slowly getting there. But regarding transparency from the devs i think the last update was on the anniversery stream regarding optimization.
---
And how am i salt machine for disliking that every Ghostface sits there and camps? That the killer is basically a way for toxic people such as yourself to fuel some self righteous hatred towards survivors that really is unjust given the fact we're playing the same damn game. And without survivors you can't play the game
---
I've literally died on hook over hand cramps and my lack of rhythm. I understand they want me to feel like I'm struggling but maybe make it so I don't have to mash *so* hard? Tbf I'm very prone to tendonitis so maybe I'm on an extreme end of the curve here.
---
Send me a macro tutorial pls.
---
I'm trying! But on PC tho :(
---
depends if everyone needs to be Hit twice like in the game.
---
But most likely a Camping Wraith or just Freddy
---
That's not half bad. I'd take that deal.
---
😱😱😱
---
True! I love the teamwork aspect tho, even if I’m working with dipshits sometimes.
---
Blame these greedy devs.
---
When MoM was first leaked, weeks before his release, most veterans agreed and explained to them the incoming shitshow it would create.
---
They don't care, they released it and made money  for months on this toxic situation.
---
As usual, they literally thrive on this.
---
This isn't a issue with just PS4, but I will say this. Wait for ghost face to become a little less new and there will be more survivors. This isn't a thing that needs to be fixed, more so it's just the game struggling at the moment with trying to find people who aren't playing ghost face
---
Spirit Fury + Enduring definitely needed! XD
---
could he possibly have had an add-on to make the detection range smaller and you were just on the outside of it very slightly fading in and out of range?
---
Definetly one of the more overlooked horror movies. That and wishmaster
---
Yup, Black Incense is incredibly useful for the no cleanse meta. Thanatophobia can really help for those who don't like to cleanse, and some people hate seeing the red bar and status so much they'll cleanse anyway.
---
I'm one of those who keeps telling 99 gauge to expose during chase is not ok - but your point is valid
---
thats a good argument, and i dont want to argue but im a glutton for punishment. Im gonna give you the most stereotypical response you could receive. 
---
 around the time of the d strike nerf, NOED was buffed. I cant think of a single killer perk thats allows for safety and mistakes or blatant bad plays but rewards them with a kill just for picking up the controller after the gates get powered. Thats another reason I was so salty in my
---
previous post, people only seem to mind strong perks when it makes killers have a harder game. I dont even think noed is that powerful but it was buffed around the d strike nerf and im still butthurt about it. I dont even run noed on killers because you if youre not trash you get the 4k before the gates are powered. that just reinforces your statement about perks allowing players to be careless and make mistakes but still being rewarded. and hope you have a good day too friend. Im really don’t think ghostface or noed is op at all, but they definitely massacred my boy

---
I was in a house, he was at the door and I was just at the end of the stairs. If that's the case, those add-ons are overpowered

I go there directly. I like to die in EGC right next to him too, because he's more important than winning.

I AGREE.

The guy who owns the character sets the rules and he doesn’t have access to any scream movie rights. And he created “Ghost Face” so he’s gonna lease it under that name.

Being sick is the worst thing ever.  Personally, being sick is the closest thing there is to organic torture there is, and theres little to no way to deal with it other than drugs, which aren't available in the entity's realm.
---
I'd say roughly 80% of people associate badly with vomiting.  Seeing these new studies about nerves in our stomachs playing a big role in mental health make a lot of sense.  I've had a handful of horrible stomach bugs in my childhood and I unfortunately remember the anguish I felt every time.  And I'm sure everyone else did, repeatedly adding more acrid bile to a trash can next to your bed and having to tolerate that faint lingering smell as you try to sleep.  Now imagine that horrible feeling, but with an instant onset and while you're *physically exerting yourself* running for your life with your heart pounding and lungs rasping, your throat is raw and sore and mucus is drowning your sinuses, and vomit is constantly swelling in your neck while your stomach lurches and gnarls into a tight and stressful knot.  Horrible.  Then add on top of the fact that a half-decayed, ornately dressed woman who's probably way taller than you is chasing you down.
---
I guarantee you will *never* forget the smell of her incense.  Your brain will pavlov the shit out of this whole experience, at least I know mine would.
---
Smoky, earthy and flowery incense, drying and sticking to your throat.  Getting brief but repeated whiffs of vile, acidic bile down the front of your shirt, your hands, arms, legs.  Both yours, hers, and your unfortunate teammates.
---
Physical exertion just makes it worse, your head probably hurts and your legs are trembling and flimsy, working on generators is made even worse as it's now covered in infectious vomit, making everything just miserable.  You're probably getting dizzy from just standing and crouching so frequently.  No wonder you can get downed in one hit, you're literally the worse you've ever felt.
---
While ghostface and Myers down you with the brutal strength/intensity of their stabs (exposed), the Plague doesn't need strength to put you on the ground.  You're **broken**.  So physically fucked up you're incapable of keeping yourself standing.  But wait, there is hope.
---
Those fountains.  Crystal clear water spilling from the mouth of those stone reservoirs.  The finely polished basalt figure tarnished over time and repeated usage, stained by time and dozens of purges.  You need to push the notion that many many people have vomited everything inside of their bodies into this reservoir to the back of your head and drink this water.  Rub it all over you, clean your face and let it drip down your body.  Ice cold and probably unpleasant, but much better than puke.  One final, gut-wrenching, vocal-forcing purge into the clean water, so hard it stains the water crimson, ripping the tiniest of tears along your throat and duodenum as they've been progressively weakened by your stomach acid.  But now, you're better.  This magical water has miraculously put you in a tolerable state of existence.  Your throat is no longer drenched in mucus, but is instead slightly sore.  Your stomach is unsettled and still gurgling, but you no longer feel the urge to puke from just walking too fast.  Now hope the entity is merciful enough to keep you healthy til the end of the trial, there's still so many infectious friends and a highly infectious foe never further than about 500ft away.
---
I'm level 12 killer and I just had a lobby of rank 20s, I felt so bad. It's really not fun at that point

Yep, just spin the wheel. It will count as multiple button presses.

No! Do not recommend. Play survivor with me instead and make friends &lt;3  even if you’re just kidding. My steam is deathroguexo

If youre busy on that 1 person all game thats your fault
---
I'm sorry, but the cursor being placed over Ghostface's mouth makes it look like he's going :O
---
LOL,imagine no one wanting to play a mori game.  Almost as if it's unfun or something.
---
It's watermarked
---
Okay, if you have over 1000 hours playing the game you know it's not possible to play around End/Spirit Fury at all times - killer can shorten just enough distance to be in lunge range in between routing, or do an effective enough double back to have enough distance not to get a hit but to force spirit fury. Frankly if you aren't getting enough usage out of EndSF you probably aren't playing very well. 
---
I'm not sure what part of this you're misunderstanding, but if you are trading a hit for a stun with enduring spirit fury you will recover pretty much instantly (enduring) and destroy the pallet (spirit fury) while getting a hit, meaning you very likely instantly down the survivor. That is definitely not pointless, but good survivors do not throw pallets when its obvious they'll be hit in the first place. Your experience aside, there is a reason most good players constantly have it equipped on M1 reliant killers.
---
thinks about it like this though, killer players want more high tier killers so they can have a bit more variety and have fun. Well lets only have killers who have a high skill power be strong. Ok fair enough. then BHVR doesn't make skill based powers for killers. Well now what., just because BHVRisn't making certain types of killers means we can't have strong ones? How about they don't nerf the little things about a killer and instead build on them and make more intricate killers and have some fun and strong powers.

Thanks for the tips! I’ll give it another try and follow the above when my bruised ego heals

What's wrong with Thanatophobia?

I was talking about this yesterday, I think since release i have played 2 enjoyable games against GF. The rest have just been tbagging, camping, tunneling, shit stains. 
---
 It has bumped him up to one of my least fav killers to play against, i got tbagged by a streamer after i threw a pallet to heal one of my teamates but the game just teleported me away and i died bc of it
---
My first game against GF was Someone camping the basment on The game
---
I had a few ebony mori GFs that tbagg and tunnel every time the survivors fucking sneeze   
---
Its a huge issue, i was looking forward to this new killer but he is now a killer i only see toxic ass hats play like Spirit, Clown, and doc
---
Meme build monday?
---
Game over. 
---
*Oink.*
---
Because that's not true and just your confirmation bias
---
thats what I mean lol....
---
they rage if i stop them from healing, but teabag if I let them. Its like as a killer you will get raged at no matter what you do, so fuck other players and do what you want as a killer
---
I definitely quit before the game even loads in when I see the questionable offering, you play a mori or a three + blink nurse, you should expect it, have fun with your dc games though.

I have played 6 matchs today, and 5 of them at least 1 person DC'd. 3 in another match. The killer and i farmed for a bit, then i let him kill me. Only seemed fair. Its flat-out, ruining the game for me.
---
Holy shit thank you so much,it was on the tip of my tounge
---
What is your point
---
It is overpowered. Not being able to reveal him if you are not right kissing him is overpowered. With those add-on you have two possibilies: Reveal him and give him a free hit or getting exposed.
---
I've heard two versions:   
---
1. It doesn't do anything atm  
---
2. It slows down literally everything, including vaulting speed  
---
So well, idk
---
The best quality of life thing I've done for this game is switching my struggle to mouse wheel up.
---
Yes we can still use it. The devs said that.
---
LOL, you don't even play real dead by daylight then.  But no one wants to play your sweaty mori games, well most at least.
---
One still allows you to play the other one not.
---
Got told slugging was a crutch for people who are "unconfident" whatever that means.
---
I agree it's hard as hell to hit anyone more than 10 meters away who isn't moving in a straight line. I just adapted and throw the bulk of my hatchets while they drop pallets, vault pallets, or vault windows. If they run straight, I'll also try to nail them.
---
i just started watching Ash Vs Evil Dead and I appreciate it this so much. very nice work
---
Pretty sure in P1 you get a bloody top as well, no? Or is that just survivors?
---
I'm bringing up a common problem with survivors if you don't like it please scroll past :)
---
Don't be dumb. Obviously you know I meant a 12 year old who is a dick.
---
Her big.  U-Unga.
---
If they took a hit for someone, then theres another survivor nearby, leave them on the ground for a bit to go after the other before coming back to pick them up. They made ds a lot harder to hit nowadays, lmao
---
Yeah sure, obviously everyone is free to play as he wants. What im trying to say is that we can and imo we should underline the difference between ruining the game and a stupid sign of "disrespect"
---
Press M1 while crouched to pay respects
---
Lol I never see nurse until last game wtf
---
The only genuine nerf I'd like to see is- Decrease time it takes to pull him out of stealth in a chase.
---
I want him to require a different playstyle, you shouldn't be able to expose someone so easily in a chase as it disincentives finding creative ways to stick to the shadows. 
---
Stalking during a chase should be a Myers thing.
---
''real dead by daylight''. I used a mori once. I can't even continue this argument with these child-like comments. Bye.
---
No reason to try and be condescending. I think I found my answer about being sensitive though. Have a good one chief.
---
I don't want him to be nerfed, i do however want his spotting to be more defined. As playing AS ghostface feels like you get spotted across the map, but playing against feels like you can literally stare them directly in the face and they will still remain "hidden"
---
And honestly i don't think there's any way to make the tbag mechanic stop unless the toxic pricks find and even more toxic way to adress themselves.
---
But on both sides there are whiney ass hats who make others look bad simply because they can scream louder
---
Killers want to kill people and have fun doing it. As long as nurse is one of the few killers who can't be bullied when played well we will see mainly her at higher ranks. 
---
If you had survivor perks tied to the survivor they come from only then I guarantee we see only Megs, Claudette, and maybe a couple others.
---
TLDR: the solution for more killer variety at red ranks is not to nerf killers, but to buff the least played ones.
---
nice work! you plan on doing the same for survivors?
---
I’m just saying did your complaint in the past for your “common” problem work? Beggars cant always be choosers my friend
---
Yeah that's how this community works. Notice the downvotes? I agree when they camp and then chase, but if you run into them together well after a hook save, you would be stupid not to focus on the hurt one.
---
I've legit let injured survivors run away without chasing them, even if I don't see the other survivor, and then at the end of the game if they escape they're teabagging the gate and sending "trash" messages haha.
---
Ghostface isn't anywhere near the level of power map control of those killers though.
---
Yeah I was so dumbfounded when I switched from Killer to survivor for the first time. 
---
I was the last one alive but got caught opening the doors. Only got 1.000 points or so out of 8.000. I was like «  oh so that’s the grind everyone was talking about ». 
---
Playing Killer gives so much more BP it’s insane, no wonder I can’t play it anymore with the event and now the Gruesome Gateau’s everywhere.
---
It's the same for me when I play killer.
---
I either try hard and get made fun of/taunted/flamed (no matter how I perform) or I 'play for fun' and it doesn't go along that well ... resulting in getting made fun of.
---
You're contradicting yourself you're telling me not to complain by complaining.. It's hilarious. And yes I wanted to see if other people agreed and they did :)
---
Slight correction, if he stalks you and then injures you without exposing he will also lose his progress on the stalk.
---
Even if it happened before the events of Halloween 2, it is still the same timeline, so what was true for Halloween 2 is true for Halloween 1.
---
I think you get the difference between camping and tbagging
---
Didnt they say they are going to ban people who abuse it kinda like with legion double blades?
---
Why don’t you think it’s because of people playing Killer ? 
---
With the event and the Gateaux EVERYONE wants the sweet sweet BP. I can’t play Killer anymore because of this.
---
It's Claudette but sadly I don't know what outfit.  I was killer and got glitched into that position, added the survivors in-game and asked for a screenshot.
---
Mouse and keyboard allows more precise aim very quickly
---
Can't wait til dedicated servers. People like you ruin the game.
---
There was no vote manipulation happening! Upvoting pig posts is like ... just automatic, like clicking “like” on kitten and puppy posts on Facebook. Today is a sad day.
---
It’s its own separate timeline, negating the discovery that they were siblings in H2.
---
I completely agree with you; I think people take tea-bagging way too seriously, but for some reason, people get offended because of a random person on the internet pressing their crouch button.
---
ok
---
Sorry to inform you, console is a hot mess in comparison to pc, that's just a fact.  But if it offends you enough to call it child like, suit yourself.
---
I reported the first instance where the door was sped up, but I’m trying to get more examples and information before reporting anything else.
---
I’m having a hard time getting data in public matches, though, since people won’t cooperate.
---
Its funny because when i play killer I pretty much always get higher rank survivors, but when I play survivor I’m getting people thrown in from ranks 16-20 every single game.
---
Wish I was exaggerating but it’s serious horse shit.
---
It was a perk for everyone that wants less of a challenge, the same people that can't see the upside to No Mither.
---
You get an almost guaranteed extra hit, and that can be abused by good players. Again, the ones that need something like that the least.
---
I have seen it, and it can be used by good survivors still, only they have to play the hero to get it.
---
I dont think Ash's hand would help considering LF is a gargantuan beast of a man and the biggest threat with LF is his feral kid nature. Even if Ash was to inflict dmg onto LF, he would still stand strong and more aggressive which is why he is A tier in terms of difficulty
---
Evidently for vote manipulation. The mods feel that they urged the r/_Oinkers community to upvote everything pro-pig and downvote everything not related to pig.
---
Sounds to me like the killer wanted all 4 kills and did not want the hatch to open.
---
Thank you, enjoy watching Ash vs Evil Dead!
---
Nothings going to change, their current line is 40% dc rate, which is very generous, you can dc at will and still not hit that, even if they tighten that up, it won't be a huge problem.  DCing mori games, is not ruining anything btw.
---
I mean, most of the time, if I'm chasing someone and down another person because they took a hit (or on one or two rare occasions, just barely got in the way), I always get excited and just pick them up as I generally don't like leaving people on the ground as I have a hard time spotting slugs and lose them if they crawl for more than 20 seconds. 
---
In hindsight, I should question why this injured survivor was so adamant about taking a hit for someone else, but I've played for so long and had so many people willingly trade hooks so someone else can escape, I just brush it off.
---
Yeah, I've seen footage of this cosmetic, but also can't find it in the store, and searching for it online shows no results for me. I even looked at all her available and unavailable DLC cosmetics and it wasn't listed there either. Weird!
---
I have seen a lot of idea about how to improve level and getting perks and almost all of them are better than what we have now.
---
Ebony mori and tier 3 NOED. When you just won’t accept losing as an option.
---
You're 100% right. Just found them.
---
'Patrol Cap' is the fedora hat, and 'Military Shirt' is the coat. Both part of Claudette's Frosh Week Warfare (which means the pants is likely the 'Muddy Combat Boots' shorts.
---
Honestly she sucks but I like her ability so I use her anyway...but I use ruin,shadowborn,barbecue and chili and nurses calling or whisperers
---
Ah ty, I've never played Myers before
---
pffft
---
Can they just nerf nurse pls. Send out semi strong killers, but fuck that bitch and billy with bbq.
---
She’s 8 years old people! Stop it get some help
---
I started to play when spirit came out lol what
---
Oh look a person with actual common sense. THANK YOU!
---
I'm of firm belief that Ghostface is broken right now and I personally refuse to play him until his announced hotfix is released.
---
With that in mind I think he's *broken*, not **overpowered.** Revealing him is way too hard and currently certain addons make it far too easy to stalk a Survivor way too fast. The hotfix that BHVR announced is looking to fix those issues while inversely buffing some of Ghostface's weaker aspects (if a Survivor reveals him he'll see them for longer) which I think is a good move.
---
I'm still of the firm belief that Ghostface will never be as powerful as Nurse / Billy / Spirit because he inherently doesn't have the mobility that those Killers have. At best he'll be on par with Myers and honestly I think Myers has a lot more strengths than Ghostface (though Toastface also has his perks over Myers.) Currently even in his "broken" state I still think he's on par with the likes of Huntress and Hag in terms of tier lists. With his hotfix his tier placement won't drop much in my eyes but he'll just generally feel more fair to play and require more skill if you want to get instadowns, as opposed to just staring at the Survivor's face and then oneshotting them.
---
My best piece of advice is to get a PC, get DBD on steam, then play nurse on that. That’s how everyone can get better at her.
---
And the invisibility would be so stressful! And he's gross to look at lol. 
---
I wondered about Legion, but I think that them being teens would make it less scary for me. Like I'd be more angry than anything.
---
prestige 1 for killers is the weapon and prestige 1 for survivors is the top body :)
---
I understand what you mean but if every killer is high tier then there whil not be much fun left for people playing survivor
---
Yeah, she'd be scary to look at, but I don't know if being smacked with her claw would be particularly painful compared to like, being chainsaw'd.
---
Love this. Half Birdman half Phantom of the Paradise
---
what next pharmacy gives green medkits in every chest search?
---
actually yes and i already got quite the progress with them. I dont even know why im doing this tbh. i just want to complete the game i guess :D
---
I think Huntress is a wee bit better than Hag, and maybe Wraith is a bit higher on my list, but yeah this looks solid!
---
It's not a joke but whatever, you keep your us vs them mentality. Someone points out the toxic mentality of people like you, clearly they are salty. Despite me never advocating for any changes on Ghostface or anything just that the people playing him are kinda dicks. Which you proved perfectly so thanks love have a wonderful day
---
thats a tought one... a lot of prestiges look amazing. but i think id actually say trapper. in my opinion he looks the most intimidating with his bloody body
---
it can bee good for breaking off of a chase and going for another nearby survivor. It's good to juggle survivors and make sure that some are wasting time healing or trying to fund a gen. Its like how tier 2 Myers can sneak up on people but you just have to do it while in chase. I don't think its a GREAT perk but I'm sure it has its uses hear and there. Also you know the Freddy stuff.
---
Sprint Burst, Dead Hard, Lithe. Exhaustion perks good.
---
Adrenaline, no explanation needed, amazing perk.
---
Bond for the information, or Self Care for reliable self healing.
---
Borrowed Time, Decisive for cucking killers.
---
Im gonna get downvotes for this, but you should probably avoid balanced landing. It's the least consistent exhaustion perk, It's too map/rng based and you can get downed before you have a chance to activate it.
---
I wish they would add an extra second for when you look at him and become exposed
---
Spirit should also be S. She is strong enough to be S. Assuming this list is made for an expert of playing each killer.
---
use it on Freddy with red paintbrush and monitor and abuse 0 terror radius for the whole game
---
Being strangled is very painful though!
---
I love my Legion boy but, I really couldn't put him there.
---
I played agaisnt him the other day after learning how he works. I watched him Frenzy, saw him hit me, and then... I just stopped caring about him. I KNOW he can't down me now, and I know that he'll either have to stun himself right in front of me, or he'll completely ignore me. So I just started mending and healing right in the open while he chased someone else.
---
He's just not strong *at all*. He can DO stuff, but.
---
Nah, the game consistently has 20 pallets
---
So why do you think its ok to DC when you see a secret offering.
---
Lmao facts
---
I'm grateful that all we can do is speculate on a reddit post instead of actually having to worry about it.
---
I like Michael's it sounds like he got hit in the balls
---
Not using macros in 2019 o.O
---
Do you agree with the fact that they're two different things and they one should not be an excuse for the other? If so, there's no point in pointing out sensitiveness and other shit because it only shows that you are the one sensitive about the post. 
---
If you just agreed then you would have just go on. 
---
Now you're acting like the seeker of truth while I was the one saying that I got the inspiration from a real situation. 
---
And btw the goal is one and simple. The reason behind it should not have any type of influence on your understanding of the post.
---
what exactly do you mean?
---
Like everyone, but guess who listens to the reeeeees of the unadaptale.
---
Survivors bring it on themselves 99% of the time. Gday.
---
I like how things are right now. I get a good mix of people my rank, sometimes some games where I'm higher rank, sometimes I'm a bunch lower. Keeps it fresh. If this were *every* game I'd be salty, but it hasn't been in my experience.
---
We can see the watermark.
---
F
---
I did talk about the Plague and so did other people.
---
It's definitely a process. Good end-goal though. C:
---
Excluding Ghostface's new perks, I only need to PIII50 all perk Huntress, Legion, and Plague. 
---
Since Ghostface, I only have maxed Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse, and Hag so far.
---
Sure they do bud
---
Agreed. I'm a legion main and even if I wish he was higher on the tier list, I know that he isn't that threatening unfortunately.
---
Agreed. He just needs a fix.
---
Also, he was called "The Ghost" in the dev build, not sure why they changed it.

---
Cant tell you how many times Ive stared at this guy and got absolutely no reveal. They should definitely work on that aspect of him because it leads to an instant down. Otherwise hes fine.
---
Eh some people still manage to lose. I once was in solo queue against a Legion who really wanted to mori. He had an Ebony Mori, and just in case this wasn't sufficient he brought Devour Hope and Rancor. Other perks were NOED and Ruin. He was rank 11 and survivors were ranks 14-16. He was only able to mori a single survivor, three escaped. Oh my.
---
Well shit there you have it folks, this one guy on reddit said he never loses as nurse. Now we know for sure she's broken.
---
I get this is a shitpost...
---
But does anyone play SWF with a "designated killer follower"?
---
Not only that, there are addons that largely reduce the radius of detection AND the time of being detected. It already takes 1.5 seconds to fully reveal ghostface; That's 1.5 seconds he can charge 50% of your bar standing up with purple mark-speed addons, no lean.
---
You have to wonder how many people just don't know he doesn't get instantly revealed and just get their marked bar completed when it was almost done, by just staring right at him.
---
Even playing him, I've had people stop in my face and stare at me to reveal me - working as intended - and end up getting marked and then complaining about it in post-game.
---
It is, and I agree that she has the potential to play better than the hillbilly (which is hard to admit as a Hillbilly Main) but I don’t see her in the same tier as nurse personally. Gen grabber spirit is powerful af but the nurse literally has the potential to break the game. I do love spirit though and would play her if my headphones weren’t broke
---
I can totally feel you man!  
---
I just got all Killers P3 LVL 50 again, feelsgoodman
---
Button mashing during the struggle phase adds nothing to the game and is a relic of gaming that died in 2006 #ChangeMyMind
---
That's a lot of french salt
---
I’ve never been up to 20, but I’ve definitely been over 10. 
---
Sounds like OP decided to hang out in a bugged lobby though.
---
Man
---
Actually no, I'm going to restate what I said. How do survivors bring it onto themselves hmmm? In all my time playing killer rarely do I see a truly toxic survivor. But near every game with ghostface is toxic kiddos wanting to prove they're big
---
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard, how do they get evidence of that? Lol
---
Oof, good breakdown! I felt nauseous just reading this lol. And the whole thing with the Plague is that you have to pick between staying sick (easy to down, uncomfortable to deal with) and cleansing (giving the killer a ranged weapon). No good option there imo.
---
if you tunnel off hook you deserve to get hit with it.
---
Frequency of killers in red ranks on PC:
---
1) Nurse, Billy, Spirit
---
2) Hag, Huntress
---
3) Myers and now Ghostface
---
4) Everyone else
---
**S H I R T L E S S  M Y E R S  W H E N ?**
---
he caught me, t-bagged me and then gave me my death hook but lets not talk about that
---
Haha thanks!! I love the Mori's, facecamps, intense chases, flashlights and saves! It's what gived the game life and makes it fun! Why play immersed, do gens then escape? Boring. Gotta have fun, not just escape. 🤘👍
---
blueddit
---
Me too. The prestige stuff just looks super cool (except the knife). Im so hyped for the bloody mask.
---
I'm a simple man: I see OjOj memes, I upvote.

Too lazy to send a tutorial but look up macro autoclick tutorial on YouTube
---
You sound like the people who claim men can't know true pain because they never went through childbirth.  
---
Just because something is harder doesn't mean it's harder and just because something is easier doesn't mean it's easy, yes.  
---
Comparisons of opinion are made in relative terms, comparisons of something scientific, like comparing numbers, is done in absolute terms unless required otherwise. That's how it's always been and how it will always will be. Now, luckily, something like a learning curve is something you can actually measure by gathering statistics and using those numbers for comparison, but unluckily we're not the ones with access to that information, so we go right back relative comparisons. In other words, sounds like you're just arguing for the sake of arguing.
---
I was being hyperbolic, he uses enduring + spirit fury far more than he should. They're good perks but not on everyone.
---
So amazing! I wish I can have him.
---
This \^ &lt;3
---
I would rather have an actual scary game mode that doesn't involve fixing things like generators. Just think about a game where survivors have a health bar instead of the 3 health states and all killers have no terror radius. No pallets, no scratchmarks.
---
You are not supposed to report camping.  
---
[Report system](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system) - go under "Unsportsmanlike Conduct".
---
This has actually happened to me once few nights ago, how do I know it didn't work? The bleed out timer didn't run out and when the skill check appeared I thought I hit it but close call and I just took the benefit of the doubt that I missed. But when I went to use it second time even though I didn't get to use it first unhook it was unavailable as if I already used it.
---
The problem is that they're still very slow to do proper balancing changes and thus far have only made reactionary balance changes based on community 'feedback'. They need proper internal testing with good players around perks and how they interact with each other, survivors, and the killer. I think they're starting that  with the vanilla gameplay test they're inviting people for, I hope it gets good results.
---
Is that bugged as well? Geniunely curious as I run it on my survivor build but have been only playing ghost face lately.
---
This is pretty dope
---
Your post didn’t offend me it’s a game, you asked for opinions which is why you posted it. So I say again I’m sorry I hurt your feelings smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
Most moderators in the official forum are either useless or damaging, he's one of them
---
Why is Kosaku Kawajiri, the completely normal family man, getting wrapped up in this?
---
I don’t normally slug either, unless theres someone else right there I can chase down quickly, and for finding people on the ground deerstalker helps a ton. I use it for near end game because I usually slug the second to last alive to avoid hatch spawning so I can get the 4k, and deerstalker helps me relocate the guy I slugged
---
People would definitely get offended by that for some reason
---
Iridescent Huntress is almost Nurse-tier, I'm glad it's locked behind an ultra rare. I almost feel bad when I use it.
---
Yeah I guess Huntress is more map dependent than Hag. I just find that I'm on a decent map for her more often than not, I don't get many matches at the terrible maps like Meat Plant.
---
Don't worry you didn't but you go back to commenting pointless things on people's posts just to let off some salty steam :)
---
Spirit and Hag swapped, Plague moved downed to D or F and Freddy bumped up and this list is good
---
Pig=Upvote  (Waiting to be banned)
---
Who said anything about camping?
---
At one point, I used Deerstalker a lot to prevent a hatch escape, but since Endgame, I just hook and immediately look for the hatch. If the survivor isn't dead on hook, I usually have enough time to find the hatch and spam spacebar to shut it.
---
I heard one of the devs say it was not necessary on a streaming
---
I hate getting tunneled for playing Quentin even not having Wake Up
---
What does the post have to do with camping?
---
I meant disconnecting, fixed.
---
Me too.
---
He created ghostface, not Ghost Fave. See what these sneaky ass devs did?
---
Not bugged per say but a reason I would run noed. That instant health state heal in the middle of a chase or watching the mostly injured team just reset the hit you put on them. Biiiig middle finger.
---
HATANIKA DINGHIR ASA COMAYYY
---
I get excited when I hear the nurse blinking on console ngl. It’s partially because nurses are so uncommon, but also because 9/10 times I know I’ll escape tbh. Console nurses are wild, man.
---
I never get lucky enough to find hatch before they do, so I just slug to avoid it being open in the first place, works a lot better for me
---
Yes. And I don't care what most people say the ratio of toxic survivors far outweighs toxic killers I've only ran into.
---
They are two different actions but in your post this is a cause of action and reaction.  You Tebagged therefore got camped. You might not agree with it but that is how you wrote it and thats what happened. You called them sensitive but your the one making a post and then deleting it about a video game. Face it your ten ply bud.

What if my solo queue teammates are bad?
---
I’m sure they got permission to put 1 space in. The guy who owns the rights keeps this shit close to the vest so I wouldn’t be shocked if he had to sign off on everything
---
yikes
---
I feel you. I've got the full Legacy Trapper but still prefer the normal Prestige attire. Besides him i really like Ghostfaces Prestige stuff. Especially the cloak looks so cool with the bloodstained ribbons floating around.
---
Wait until the next ghostface instant downs you and teabags you until you have no health left then pick you up and drop you until you reach a hook.
---
Happy f'n 3rd anniversary, where the developers celebrate with no real event and half a chapter without new survivor or new map.
---
It's like, "~~Fuck~~ Thank you for still playing this, here is a box of nothing to celebrate".
---
He’s not strong at all which is true he’s better off at pipping it seems like whenever I use him I get 3 iridescents and a gold
---
Youre the type of kid who fuckd his sisters sister's cabbage patch dolls
---
Thought this too. Well at least he did accomplish that.
---
DCing at all is dumb. You know it. Why you defend it is beyond me.
---
Excuse me but Amanda stun is best stun &gt;:C
---
Because honestly it's annoying how people like you ruin honestly good killers reputation, and make it seem like survivors are whiney and bitchey when you're the one who bothered to name himself SurvivorsCryTooMuch. 
---
I have have said nothing about the killer himself but you are trying to push this thing that I'm a whiney survivor main. When all i had to say is out of 20 games, 18 ghostfaces are going to be toxic because they can tbag. 
---
What did the survivor do? Tried to survive? Ok cool and you did your job of downing them great, so why do ghostface players feel the need to bm and camp? You're not showing skill, you're not making it a fun game, all you're doing is purposely being a dick to someone you don't know? Who most likely did nothing to you and didn't even bm you first? Yea that's not an issue in the slightest
---
Stories that never happened
---
You had me in the first half. Then you said some noob rank 20 stuff.
---
Back when it wasn't patched I used David Ze's cloudextract so I got legacy illegitimately etc.
---
Same honestly
---
Legion's power is now a detriment in chase, same as Freddy and Bubba. You vault slower than survivors unless you run Bamboozle, and thats only for windows, and vaulting no longer has a point beyond getting first hit anyways, which would mean you got a bad start on your chase. His tracking is limited to his terror radius without Add-ons, his map mobility stuns him and is barely much faster than base movement speed and wastes your power if you do find a survivor, and mend is probably just a worse version of dream world at this point. easy to get rid of, takes very little time, is in no way threatening.
---
 They're nowhere near Clown, and not as good as Wraith, or Trapper.
---
No I'm sorry bro. In the game I'm referring to I didn't camped ahahahah. Not even had the occasion. I like your prophetic assumptions but this ain't it chief. 
---
Deleting it? Did I delete the post without realising it?
---
Ok thank god haha
---
I really don’t even know what you’re trying to say at this point, you’re just agreeing with me in an argumentative tone and then saying I’m the one arguing for the sake of arguing 🤔
---
Is this tier list made with addons in mind?
---
Spirit B tier, really? Out of all of the decisions I didn’t expect this one to be called out. Spirit has:
---
good map mobility, dangerous chase potential, very high mind game potential, fairly decent amount of stealth and the ability to slow down the game with gen grabs. I think she is the second best killer in the game
---
What would picking yet another synonym for the exact same thing accomplish?
---
I'll do it as both killer and survivor
---
To an extent
---
Ok
---
Shouldn't be any hooks by the totem, too campy. It make solo queue games just a fight for who get the hatch.
---
Ash wins
---
Honestly Myers is better than Ghostface simply because of his snowball potential.Ghostface has none.
---
At first I'll write "I don't care" a few times and then if they still carry it on - P R E G N A N C Y
---
Oh gotcha :) thanks!
---
Here can end chases quickly, but has no map pressure. If you bring perks for 3 genning and are smart you can do well with him. He's not top tier, but he's close. One of the better m1 killers, but not the best.
---
I know everybody forgets, but every time a new killer is released it gets like this for a few weeks until they Nerf then into Oblivion, then it goes back to normal.
---
You obviously can’t hold a conversation without dismissing someone when you feel there opinion doesn’t matter, you’re calling me salty instead of stating a valuable argument. :)
---
How did you do?
---
The thing with the nurse is that it's a killer that directly depends in your ability as a player, it's the only killer that literally has a whole different mecanic.
---
Not everyone's gonna play the tutorial, especially not if you don't realize just how much of a learning curve this game has.
---
What bugged perks?
---
The only bug I see is devour hope not showing the notification which isn't the same since you can imagine that just paying attention while wake up just make the game impossible to manage
---
Is this satire?
---
Took you long enough to think of that. Must have read it from your diary then projected it on to me. Sorry kid but try again
---
Tbh I'm disappointed that they didn't call him "The Scream"- like idk if it had to do with copyright issues or not but if not then c'mon! The Scream woulda been perfect
---
He may not necessarily be a "killer" but the accident was caused by his drunk driving. He's not innocent at all.
---
I don't think there is a committee or anything, just whoever finds them first I guess
---
I made a macro so I just hold F3 when on hook and F4 to wiggle when being carried by killer
---
You're literally doing the same thing by saying I'm offended when I'm not and just because you don't think my post will help me doesn't mean it won't.. You just keep accusing me of things that you're doing yourself I can't even.
---
True but I think that’s balanced out by GF having far more individual chase potential and the ability to lose his terror radius throughout the game instead of just in tier one. A thing I would give to my boi Myers is that he has far better add ons, but base ability I would say Ghostface is better. So overall I’d say there about even
---
Maybe Ruin + NOED + camping killer is what keep rank 20s from ranking up. Or maybe it's why the queues are so long.
---
This is my favorite part of playing pig! She is so interactive with the survivors &lt;3
---
Scroll your mouse wheel down when rebinding
---
we actually need this in the game.
---
why tho its just ruining the community...
---
“What’d it cost?” “My 4K.”
---
Because his mommy told him he was perfect and you putting him on that hook is impossible unless you’re cheating.
---
"*laughs in NOED and Blood Warden*"
---
Sound familiar?
---
Thx!
---
I disagree, shes much more inconsistant than Billy. You could argue that she is better than Hag I suppose, but Billy has map pressure 24/7 (whereas Spirit has hers on cooldown most of the time) good chase potential if you know how to curve and a solid insta down. Spirit is good, but not Billy good IMO. I'd put her B+.
---
A nerf and adding reasonable counter-play aren't necessarily the same thing. If you're able to land a pallet stun on a Ghost Face with no redlight, I completely agree that it should pull him out of stealth. Just makes it so the killer shouldn't play as auto-pilot.
---
And I say that as a killer main.
---
A bit off topic but speaking of Spectres you need to check out the DC character The Spectre, an absolute badass he is
---
LoL
---
My first love and still my main. I fuck around but when I really need to fucking demolish some cunts I pull out the huntress
---
I think they remain ambiguous on topics like bugs, DC's and others to make us keep playing to see if they fix the problems.
---
Came to say this. Changed it almost a year ago and life is so much better this way. Cool you know I'm not the only one.
---
How does it feel being accused of something? You’ve been doing that since my first post. Now let’s just agree to disagree cause I honestly was here to state my side and you made this game less fun with you in it
---
Did somebody pee in your Cheerios?
---
I just don't get it so you guys are mad that survivors are efficiently doing the main goal and escaping instead of worrying about other things that don't really matter?
---
I think the game checks for any add ons that prevents the loss of items when you do get sacrificed. If there's no add ons that prevent it then the item is lost
---
Go to Options &gt; Controls &gt; then go down to where it says "Hook Struggle." You can rebind it there along with anything else that you would like to change. If you hit the arrows on the sides you can change your killer keybinds as well.
---
check Amazon! they are making a huge sale on p\*\*\*. Gotta get me some of that fat p\*\*\*
---
Eh I've seen comments and posts calling for some pretty big nerfs
---
Sometimes add ons like that are automatically re equipped if you have another one of them in your inventory, like how killer power add ons will be equipped the next game if you have them available. I would check your numbers to see if they go down or not and another one is actually being equipped in its place.
---
I mean they're the salty ones
---
In your opinion.  I totally get why some people DC, even if not for the same reasons as me, and some are bs in my opinion, but i can really care less when people do it.  I've played many painful 3 v 1's out, but for some reason some of you are on this huge crusade, which I personally think is dumb.
---
Dude, it's not a Nerf it's a logical way to manage things
---
Now they can adjust stunning perks without taking in consideration enduring meaning will be easier to balance them. If you have to take even enduring into consideration you force a meta and an adjustment around it which is hard and unnecessary
---
The thing is, if it's only around the pallet stuns it will be used only if you wanna run certain builds not to counter a certain thing but play in a certain way instead
---
It's not a Nerf, just think about it
---
Dwight for Bond (Prove Thyself and Leader are nice as well), Meg for Adrenaline (Q&amp;Q is also nice), Claudette (even if Self Care sucks, BK and Emphaty are really good), Jake for Iron Will, Nea for Balanced Landing, Bill for Borrowed Time, Feng for Lithe, Laurie for Decesive, David for Dead Hard and that's all i guess
---
For all the people saying it’s a nerf , it’s not . They’re fixing the intended mechanic that doesn’t work properly right now. Revealing him is broken.
---
Jane. Let's just say I appreciate that survivor is in third person.
---
I personally prefer using Billy tbh but partly because my headphones are dodgy af and I’m broke and can’t afford another pair. But if you face a top tier spirit with decent headphones it feels almost impossible to lose her or run her around. Billy’s got the best map mobility in the game but that doesn’t mean much if you get ran around (thank fuck for spirit fury and enduring). I just feel that if the spirit knows how to mindgame she definitely deserves at least the same tier as billy. And not to mention she has better add ons
---
Because there's gonna be bitching about how those got buffed to much
---
Can i just say the Jake/Huntress pairing is the best thing to come out of the DBD community.

I don't think you play any m1 killer at high ranks

Why do you think I choose kate
---
I love her, the only killer I have put real time into thus far, tried them all once (non dlc) and she is just my fave hands down.  I know the excitement and satisfaction that comes with these hits lol
---
it does apply to healing,not sure though
---
Survivors circlejerking each other, then if you tunnel or noed they cry..but instaheal and ds are totally balanced and counterable
---
Why is the clown so low?

Playing both just makes me feel so guilty when I do shitty stuff lol. I brought a flashlight and just felt horrible watching big daddy mikey walking into walls. I brought a mori and the salt was higher than the Dead Sea. And I cant expect anything different cus I've been that guy

One could say, she's on her *last breath*

the could atleast make it 1 word, ghostface, not with a space
---
How do you "always" bring in an ultra rare pink addon lol?  That can't be remotely accurate unless you simply don't play much killer games.  That always cracks me up though when someone puts forth an ultra rare item or addon as a counter.  Like sure that'll help you that game but what about the other 19 games you had to play her without it?
---
can we pls end the nurses life already and make her worse than freddie
---
BBQ, Enduring, Ruin, Spirit Fury.
---
On par with Doc's giggle
---
Unless the owners demanded it be two
---
"Not all games need to have the same rules."
---
I believe "Wake up" counts as survival points, and same as healing yourself. (Unless I am wrong, then nevermind that.) Both of these give points, but it also doesn't really make sense to be there but they are. The score for it could go up to 100 Bps, not much.
---
Update 2: I was able to contact the person who disqualified me and my sis and can now re submit our entrees. Thank you all for your help!
---
It also plays whenever a player playing as Ash joins a lobby.
---
Use your eyes
---
I mean lets be honest the game is supposed to about Killers KILLING survivors. Its not about you
---
Ew, noed. Downvoted.
---
Just need a Hillbilly with the rabbits and you're all set
---
You wrote it like that so I guess my bad for making prophetic assumption? This has been fun thank you for proving your point on not being sensitive by being sensitive enough for me to get a response out of you every time I wanted.  Ya got me there cheif...lmfao
---
waste of my time.
---
Name checks out I suppose
---
I've checked, one of them gave me a new Weaved Ring, the other one didn't. I'm trying to make another instance happen to check again.
---
Thank you
---
Ew cry baby that can't handle legitimate perks. Downvoted.
---
1v4, asymmetrical, survivors don't lose items if they survive and can actually obtain new things, killers lose add-ons regardless
---
End of the discussion. It's 2019 and we still crying about things that has been discussed 2+yrs ago, it's sad
---
I have Quentin on maxed perks but can't play him this week due to extreme quin-tunneling
---
I would rather the reveal bug stays in just so they don't have any ideas to fuck with my ghosti boi.
---
Either bind it to the mouse wheel or make a macro
---
I like the clown because he can counter loops but other than that he doesn’t really do much. Other killers who can counter loops (Nurse, Spirit, Huntress, Hag and Doctor) also have other elements to their game whilst sexy boi clown doesn’t. He has no map mobility, No tracking and can’t slow down the progression of gens. He has decent chase potential with his bottles but he just can’t control the game like all the other killers above him can. In a chase he’s one of the best killers but lacks greatly in every over aspect of the game.
---
Now get all perks for all of them
---
Besides, i clearly said ''for killer mains''. A single look at your profile showed me that youre survivor main. Besides that you also seem to be quite new into the game. Probably thats why you dont get the satire behind the guide
---
Leatherface or Hillbilly's chainsaws would probably sting a little
---
*I just wanted to mention that I can run AND vault pallets* (insert grin here)
---
Well the mentality here is that chases last less than 16/32 seconds (for the hook survivor to heal 16 by the other survivor or medkit and 32 if they have self care. Don’t believe the myth that you are wasting time by going after the injured one you’re only wasting time if you play nurse/spirit to end chases fast.
---
So then the killer should just rage quit too because they see 4 players with flashlights? Yeah no get good.
---
Nurse and Nurse, isn't that obvious?
---
Lullaby gets applied to all skill checks but I don't know if it affected to Doctor Madness one and Pig Trap skill checks. I mean they could always make it so that it isn't affected by skill check affects like you always only get a max of 3 or something and maybe perks could be made around it.  
---
Like Matyr anytime you hit a skill check on the hook each survivor gets a special skill check if they are working currently or the next 45 seconds. If hit Boosts current action progress by x2 (So like they hit two great checks) and gets 10% action speed for 10 seconds. (If they hit that skillcheck)
---
Thats true. I think the mask of him looks a bit odd tho
---
I was just hoping for a legit killer guide since i don’t play killer as often and you wasted my time. simple. respond if mad.
---
Doesn’t make it right tho
---
To be fair the game could have every bug eradicated tomorrow along with a 20% movement speed to every killer and the removal of every pallet on the map, NOED gamers would still run NOED lol.  Honestly most people that run it are completely dependent on it for their kills.
---
Feng because I’m waiting for bunny feng and her mask head outfit is cute
---
It'd probably be 7 or 8 survivors vs 2 killers. 
---
To answer ur question tho. Doctor and Nurse. Doc to find them. Nurse to kill them
---
Hey bud. Firstly thanks for responding. I appreciate that you've taken the time to break down your points. While I disagree with them, I appreciate what you've done =]
---
* So we can agree that using pure numbers gives at least one definition of a nerf. I'll reference to this later. With regards to who cares about .25 seconds? All of us, and BHVR. In Ghostface's reveal buff, he got a .3 second buffer and a .5 increase in detection time. If your statement is that .25 is negligible then you're likely suggesting .5 seconds is negligible too. Not to put words in your mouth, but if you add the nerf to both add-ons and equip them, that's a .5 reduction. The same as the buff. So was the Ghostface detection time a buff or not? I think the community is agreed it was. It also proves that .25 seconds may seem negligible on paper but proves a massive difference in practice.
---
* Again, using pure numbers, the less time Ghostface spends in stealth, the less he uses his ability. On pure numbers front, this is a nerf. Secondly, Ghostface follows the format of being a basic attack killer with no counter to looping. This means that unlike the highest tier killers, he -has- to be hit by pallets. Amusingly this comparison is doubly wrong as Plague and Legion actually have a degree of counter-play with pallets. Plague has a ranged attack and Legion can vault them. Finally, and this a dig at the devs and not you: If we are going to 'bring him in line with Legion and Plague' he needs a buff to his power cooldown, as it is currently atrocious (30 seconds) and not at all like the other two killers. Legion has a 20 second recovery speed and Plague has two facets to her power, Corrupt Purge and Vile Purge; the latter is not broken by pallet stuns.
---
* If I picked up a dog and called it a cat it would still be a dog. An example of a bug is the current survivor perk bug (which I'll leave unnamed). It's an unintended bi-product caused by incorrect coding. The current marked survivor stalking power is an intended feature that BHVR failed to remove. Unintended? Yes. But due to an oversight, not a bug. Therefore we can call an oversight a nerf. It was a balance intended by Behaviour that they failed to implement, but it's still a nerf.
---
* These are unequivocally buffs, yes. They're actually welcome one as they at least help you apply a degree of pressure when being removed from your power renders you useless (presuming you didn't mark someone in time). Buffing losing your power, however, is not the way to go. I have to play badly in order to trigger this effect as I should not be being spotted. I also don't think adding buffs to your power being canceled equates to much balance, either. For comparison: unless you were to give him a speed boost when revealed (which is a horrendous idea but just an example I'm giving) then I would say that they are poor buffs that don't actually provide much for the killer.
---
* Back to the pure numbers game. If we increased the hitbox area, we would call it a buff to the killer. If the Huntress had a 4% increase on either side of the survivor to hit them, we would call that a -huge- buff. Ghostface is almost completely reliant on his power, so altering numbers to (again) decrease the amount of time spent in his power and also make it systematically easier for the player to achieve a reveal, then it is a nerf to the killer. With regards to it being a QoL change, my question would be to who? The survivor? Then it still remains a nerf to the Killer. Whether or not it is needed is debatable. I myself am on the fence about it. I've seen the detection be wonky first-hand when I play survivor (I'm console, no less). I personally don't find it necessary as I've learned how to use the reveal mechanic. But with all 'balances' and 'QoL changes', in order to this they'd have to compensate Ghostface in some meaningful way for it to not be a total nerf of his power. 
---
Together, are these things a huge nerf? No. Are these a huge nerf to a killer that is only just holding onto high-tier play? Yes. This is why I consider the word-play to be disingenuous. Context is what makes this nerf important, as it is a very minor adjustment whose impact ripples vastly into the high ranks. Apologies if people are down-voting you. You get an up-vote from me for your intent to provide an open and concise conversation. I do, however, think you are completely wrong so we will have to agree to disagree =P
---
Thanks for your response and for the time taken to read my response.
---
How dare you call Waluigi trash
---
Nurse and bubba. Nurse to get the downs and bubba to face camp them
---
Ara ara...
---
Nurse and pig? Nurse can blink to and defend the boxes to maybe cause some people to get game over'd while the pig distributes them among survivors
---
Yes, it happens in half of the games I'm against an SWF as Trapper. It's the most toxic and unfun shit I've ever had to deal with, made me quit playing Trapper entirely. Pretty much the survivor equivalent of facecamping, not really playing the game and missing out on bloodpoints just to be an asshole.
---
Frenzy spam bad
---
True
---
Haha you shouldve realized it was sacrasmn simply with the title (according to survivor mains). Its not my fault that you didnt get the joke so stop being mad at me for nothing
---
Assuming they didn't alter the number of generators, around 6 survivors would be ideal
---
Bubba's there to bring them into the basement and camp them there.
---
Make it 8 survs vs 1 rank 1 nurse and it’d still be hard to escape.
---
met another feng and the entire game we followed each other, did gens, and worked together really well. i died but they were still trying to get me even when i was hooked. teamwork :)
---
Hard? No it'd be *impossible* to escape. Let's be honest 10 good Surviviors couldn't beat a god Nurse
---
I mean you’re not wrong 😂
---
Billy for searching while Cannibal acts as defense
---
This guide showed me the light in ways I thought only the Odd Bulb could. You have changed me forevermore
---
Im glad i could open another fellow killers eyes
---
There are always some people who say unreasonable stuff, that is why the word almost in the title.
---
Would buy 😍
---
I finally got the plague this week , was worth the grind because i play with my girlfriend and we have a lot of fun playing together. I know the plague isn’t the only killer but it’s the only one I can afford so yah, I’ve been having  fun with the plague recently too! Anyone knows any good perks for her ?
---
I dont play DBD but I watch a lot and I feel like Freddy would be able to make a comeback with that
---
Yikes.
---
On this, we agree
---
What do you mean?
---
How are they lazy they're always working on this game? If you wanna see true laziness look at the bugs in  the Friday the 13th game..
---
That would probably make me switch
---
I was thinking "The Stalker".
---
I cant vouch for groups to say if someone is designated, but it's common practice of even solo survivors to commit themselves to just lurking trapped and disarming. especially if they're a 4person group, you can call out trap placement in a moments notice
---
I would disagree with your statement that wrath is better, but I hope we can agree that Bubba is better than Freddy in many ways. Bubba has an insta down, great defensive capabilities with the chainsaw that can hit multiple targets, and destroy pallets faster. Freddy has none of that and putting Bubba in the same tier as Freddy is not accurate.
---
The amount of downvotes in this thread lol
---
The wake up bug has caused Quentin's to feel the Laurie affect. 
---
Remember how all killers assume every Laurie has DS? Well now they're assuming every Quentin has wake up.

Nea
---
Either that or make it so that when you miss or get stunned you only lose 50% of your power gauge instead of the whole thing.
---
I know all of the balance stuff was done to fix exploits with their power but most of the changes ended up making the power feel extremely sluggish and not very fun to use.
---
Christ that guy was annoying.

That's my build as well
---
It's also on the shrine this week.

Are you kidding? It lasts for like 5 minutes now. Its was easier to avoid before as all you had to do was time an exhaustion perk right.

Snu snu, he was hoping for snu snu.

Dirty wh\*\*\*  
---
In french
---
Doctor is OP and hard to counter i think he at least deserves B. otherwise i think his spot in C is reasonable. Overall great tierlist, OP
---
It's a 48 meter range.
---
Says as much in the English version.
---
I hope you are being ironic...
---
I find ghostface quite fun to play against though, more fun than doctor or legion
---
The actual trademark for the character/costume is Ghost Face.
---
I'm a shit survivor because I completed all the gens and I think it's bullshit that I get punished for it? lol ok
---
First of all: Very refreshing to see someone actually dive into a conversation like this. Must have been a year since I saw something as wholesome as this on the DbD Sub. Thank you for that.
---
I also agree that we got to agree to disagree on some points. You got that first point right, I still think (and of course this is an opinion) the -0,25 won't be that bad. None of the changes will be as bad as people are trying to make them.
---
Your last point is interesting. I consider this a QoL change but of course you can argue every QoL change to one side is a nerf to the other, either directly or indirectly. So that's where you are basically right. I think there still isn't much of a discussion about the detection being whonky as hell, because it really is. I'm not a survivor professional or red ranks junkie by any means so I'm not sure if this counts much, though.
---
And again, thank you for having an actual discussion about it.
---
Thats how many people are in this game people are entitled to get their way
---
How do you lose with 3 BNPs you can literally finish like 3 generators in a minute
---
Don't watch Tyde, he generally doesn't stream when I'd be available to watch and even if he did, I'm not a big fan of Deathgarden which is the game he seems to be focusing on when he can. Similar with Tru3, he streams when I'm either asleep or working.
---
I find it interesting though, that I have to "prove" something to you with my "twitch" Streamer cred. 
---
Instead of getting off track on something unrelated, how about we focus on what I initially stated, him and his circle of friends are ultimately bad for the long term health of them game?
---
You can watch any of their vods and they are incapable of going 30-45 minutes without treating another player like garbage. They'll constantly play armchair psychologist if they meet a player they don't like and give their chat an acceptable target of "Look at this sweaty piece of shit, bet he lives in his mom's basement" and stupid crap like that. All because the person did play DbD "correctly".
---
They'll preach how people shouldn't take DbD seriously and "it's just a party game lul" and then immediately turn around and start bitching when complete strangers don't play the way they want. 
---
They'll circle jerk each other over how "wholesome" their communities are and then turn around and rip apart anyone who isn't in their clique and disagrees with them. All the while sharing gifs on Twitter and Discord like fucking children of they can be arsed to respond with more than a "yikes".
---
They are not good people. And when you have daily 5-8 hour recorded sessions plus their twitter antics you form a bigger picture showing it over a long period of time.
---
They dont want this to be another freddy. He's a pretty good killer right now, but the more people who call for a big nerf the more likely it will happen, and it can even snowball starting with something small like this
---
PFFFT
---
“great defensive capabilities” ... so camping? I don’t think camping is really something that deserves a higher tier placement, and as I said unless you camp your never really going to get a multi-hit down, it just doesn’t happen against survivors who aren’t potatoes. And destroying pallets faster isn’t really a giant positive. At base I think Leatherface is a slightly better killer because of the built in insta down but this list is also influenced by add ons to an extent and with the right add ons Freddy absolutely triumphs any killer in F or D tier. 
---
At the end of the day this list is designed for playing at red ranks and neither of these killers have any loop counter play. I feel like after Freddys rework Leatherface will be without doubt the worse killer in the game as he lacks in most of the important aspects of the game
---
That’s so awesome looking! I almost thought it was a cosplay til I read the title haha
---
Damn, you must reaaaaly be digging for something to say if you delved that far into my feed to find that. It was a joke to a meme. You're so sensitive.
---
Macro keyboard baby.  Great for struggle and wiggle.
---
That was the longest i’ve ever seen to disconnect
---
Tip #1.
---
Don’t play nurse on console
---
Lol bro don't attempt to condescend.  I have 18 P3's between killer and survivor.  You still run out of ultra rare addons if you run them "every game" lol.  You run out fast too.  I've gone through webs on Trapper who has every perk just to restock addons.  I know the spawn rates and I know for a fact that running a pink ultra rare every game is not feasible.
---
If you want a game delay perk, you can use Corrupt Intervention.  
---
Infectious Fright won't work *too well* with him, as survivors will know when you're coming.
---
I didn't delve that far in actuality.
---
Just had a match with a Dwight that had a purple toolbox + wake up. Was not a fun experience
---
Ds is meh to me. I just slug em if I see em. Insta heals make me laugh, people that carry them are not hard to catch, hense the imsta heal.
---
It was worth a try
---
That's kind of how the game works sometimes you have bad luck and lose like wtf no one is there to roll out a red carpet for you to the exit for fixing gens ffs.
---
How dare survivors use items they are given! So toxic! ^/s
---
smh
---
I’d say SWF but none of those are less than 4 ranks from you
---
I consider the "main juicy part" Evil Dead 2, but I only just started the series. It's got big shoes to fill imo
---
What's pulling the trailor?
---
holy fucking shit calm down
---
Why are ppl complaining?
---
Amazing work. I like the design and if i saw a legion like that run at me in a trial id throw my mouse and keyboard.
---
Literally 5 hours ago and over 15 comments. Quit stalking me.
---
Me want snoo snoo
---
I think in a week because once people get good at spotting Ghostface which they are already plus the hotfix people will ditch him and start playing spirit, Hillbilly, Nurse etc.
---
They think it’s unbalanced
---
« My double pip 😢 »
---
Yesterday I played almost twenty games against Ghost Face. I was Marked three times, downed once. He is not broken. I have broken him out of stealth more times than I can count, even mid-chase. And only one time that he fully stalked me did he manage to down me. He has next to nothing for combating loops. Even 99% stalking people has not profited him enough in my games. He has wonderful counter-play that does not need reworking. All these changes will do is make him easier to beat for players of the same skill and better than me. (I'm a decent survivor but not amazing. Think polished potato)
---
Try to tell that to Rule 34 artists
---
Wake up bug? How did they even bug wake up?
---
Lmao is deja vu gonna be too OP next? 😂
---
It wasn't that, it was teabagging and all that fun stuff. Its nice to see where that got them.
---
I literally took a glimpse to see what type of person I'm dealing with. I didn't have to look far to see that you're the type to post a negative comment on anything even remotely not killer biased
---
Gravity
---
It's very hard to get bloodpoints, and perks show very random on bloodweb so I can't find small game. Seeing a missing hook 40 meters away means you was gonna find the totemanyway
---

---
&gt;Are you seriously arguing Huntress isn’t a tad bit map dependent
---
Technically your right, but there aren't many maps that would decimate a huntress the same way Lerys destroys Billy. Very large maps ie swamp sux, the game is a tad annoying, but nothing terrible. She's not as bad as some people lead you to believe on Lerys, her absolute worst map is rotten fields, but at the same time, she destroys the L/T walls, some of the infinites, and most of the jungle gyms that plague Billy's maps
---
I played as ghostface for a good couple days now, I think he's pretty solid but also think that when you get revealed it shouldn't mark the survivor for as long as it does or at all, it should only tell you the direction the person looking at you is, I think that would be enough, when I get really tough to spot survivors I'll just stealth up and eventually they spot me and I wreck em, feels dirty.
---
I love playing Nurse and I play on PS4! I started out using the extra blinks so I could get a feel of how it works but I would say just run what you feel is best. I personally like aura builds on killers depending on how they play. I run BBQ on her because it helps me have map control but after that I don’t know what perks to run. I wanna use nurses but it hasn’t worked out for me like it does on stealth killers. Just play an aggressive nurse and try hard to win chases and predict the movements of survivors. I think if you keep playing her you’ll get the feel for how you wanna play and build her. I would suggest using ruin though because gens can get done pretty quickly
---
😈 we’ll meet eventually, and you will forever regret the day you dissed our kind
---
I'm only rank 10 survivor myself but I've played and tested the heck out of it in KYF so I'm pretty confident in the ranked matches now. I tested it on Twitch from the killer's perspective in a 1v1 and that match taught me so much. My advice to console players would be: no detection sound? You're doing it wrong. If he's crouched and leaning you won't detect him, switch locations and try again. If he's stood leaning you'll still need to re-angle yourself so you're about 1/3 of the way around his cover. If it's still not working face on, try aiming lower so that your character doesn't obscure your vision (possible bug).
---
The reason I'm disappointed is that as a red rank player, I'll probably have to retire him when the nerf comes. I like to play a variety of killers on my stream but I go into every Bubba match expecting a 0K these days and that's a disappointing way to play the game.
---
Thanks for your kind words though. The feeling is mutual.  I wish you a lovely day =]
---
Trapper and Hag, the paranoia would be way too real
---
I also dislike the argument of "balancing around low ranks". If the devs truly believed in doing that, every killer would be nerfed. Low rank killers stomp low ranks survivors. It's not even funny. Which is why the power dynamic sees such a heavy shift in the upper ranks. Killers get there without being fully prepared while survivors get there because they had to fight tooth and nail and become the best. Which makes it an impossible difficulty curve for killers.
---
I can definitely understand your argument, and just bear in mind this list was intended as “If a killer was played to their full potential than they would be...” sorta list. On average billy gives me more trouble when I play survivor but I feel like a god tier spirit beats a god tier billy imo
---
Tfw you cross posted this earlier this week but got removed
---
I don't exactly get this logic since you would have to "play toxic" after this happened to you in the following match and unless you run into the same people, you're only doing it against someone who didn't play this way against you yet.
---
[Was reminded of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a3zvz4/how_jakes_calm_spirit_perk_should_work/?st=jx9c4mpz&amp;sh=1adf267e)
---
What is the top perk?
---
I'm on mobile so I'm having trouble finding a source, but I heard they are slowing down all survivor action speeds no matter what, and are also affecting vaulting speeds by making it slower. So the opposite of Wake Up pretty much.
---
If someone finds a source, or has better information, please correct me.
---
What was the change to MoM?
---
Nah bro you need 69,420
---
Right, HOW though?
---
this game gives me the most amount of hate mail from any game ive played, but it's still not as toxic as overwatch lol
---
&gt;and just because something is easier doesn't mean it's easy  
---
Except you missed this second half of the sentence and completely ignored the entire one before that and the entire paragraph afterwards.
---
Shut up, nobody expects you to go calling the doctor Herman Carter or call the Nurse Sally Smithson 24/7
---
Switch it to scrolling down
---
Hardly.
---
Jesus, stop flexing on people.
---
I like how bloody trapper is, i like to say that him and hag are so bloody they look like they crawled up someone asshole and out their mouth.
---
Lol bro I've been rank 1 over a dozen times maining the weakest killers in FreddY, Wraith, and Trapper no noed or babytunnels.  You crying over decisive clearly tells all of us you tunnel off hook routinely (you wouldn't even think about decisive otherwise).  Thos of us that don't play so rank 20ish legit don't eat decisives ever.
---
I think this community is full of morons. So don't worry. Glad I made a fan.
---
lmao thought it ended like that xD
---
Exactly! I like NOED even as a survivor because it gives me more reason to do totems. It's like if all survivors had flashlights I wouldn't sit complaining or DC like a little bitch I'd get the perk that makes you drop items when striking and try my best.
---
nobody sees the /s? This is glenock said once im clearly joking.
---
And he's baaack. Something more to prove? Ahahhahahaha
---
#QuentinLivesMatter
---
Do we know when they’re gonna fix it? I genuinely like using Wake up
---
I’m pretty sure killer specific skill checks aren’t impacted
---
its clearly a joke???
---
I know that, I was being sarcastic because this is pretty obviously JLC Laurie, so I don’t know why that guy is trying to argue otherwise
---
She is tall because she needs to be able to vomit over obstacles.
---
The problem I'm having with these discussions is that I've yet to experience this "buggy" aspect of his stealth at all. I've played almost every single day since he came out and have no trouble breaking him out. I've experienced every other bug in the game. Skating, traps in auras, permanent wiggle meter, EVERYTHING. Yet I manage to not run into the bug of not breaking him out of stealth.
---
Also, also, the "buffs" he's getting are towards Killer Instinct reveal. That's the only buff. And that is an unnecessary buff. It does not need to be any longer. It's a miniscule part of his kit that no amount of buffing could make more essential. Other than making it a flat out aura reveal which would be excessive.
---
I used it against my friend in a KYF and it was pretty scummy. The only good thing that felt fun was the faster vaulting speed but that's only because the hit boxes are so junky atm, it's nice not to get hit even though you already vaulted something so long ago.
---
Other then that, you're a scumbag for using it atm. Sucks too because perks like Adrenaline, Hope, and Wake Up all got indirectly buffed cause of EGC.
---
Hes ghost face because of scream
---
Got me interested: with their ingame mechanics, who would win in a battle between the 2?
---
In a direct fight, michael would probably win as ghostface will be forced out of his power while myers can just continue stalking.
---
However, if they were dropped on a map with structures and first had to look for each other, I think ghostface would have the upper hand. His stalking ability gives the exposed effect much sooner. Myers on the other hand gives ghostface a warning when he reaches tier 2. Not to mention that ghostface's power notifies him when someone is looking at him.
---
Myers might still win, but ghostface at least stands a chance
---
Yeah, you can just have it rebuild the bloodweb endlessly, with 2 or rarely 3 perks attached.
---
Maybe he misunderstood what the game was saying?
---
No, jokes are funny
---
wiggle doesn't matter as much, but yeah I have a macro for struggle because I'm not dealing with that shit, easily the most annoying part of the game. Have the devs given any official stance on it?
---
honestly i’m trying to do the same but so far i only have my David and Dwight at P3.. currently working on Myers next so i’m pretty proud for you since i still have a long way to go
---
The killers name is not the scream in the movie.. wow
---
You sound like the type to run DS, MOM, Adrenaline , DH and then complain that killers who run NOED need a crutch perk to compensate for lack of skill
---
Moderators that ban people if they say something they don't like, meaning, an opinion they don't like. Several shadow bans so nobody can see what people posts, and when you try to report these abuses the other moderators straight up ignore you (the useless ones)
---
Had these issues before, contacted someone who had his entire account shadow banned and took months to find out were bad apples that did it. Luckily he had a friend so they restored it but even contacting this guy I couldn't retrieve it since they ignore these issues and straight up lie to you if you confront them
---
So yeah, except for not_queen I won't trust anyone in that dipshit forum full of Nazi moderators
---
*Rolls up pant leg to reveal hairy as fuck legs* You like?
---
They were long even before GF release so your argyment is invalid. Also barely anyone plays GF from what I have seen.
---
Yea... And you are one of the morons buddy
---
How is that flexing?  He was the one that questioned my understanding on bloodweb rarity spawns with p3 and went out of his way to list his amount to me.  All I did was respond factually and deliberately addressed what he said to me.  Read what he wrote he was clearly talking down to me lol.
---
Doctor is really weak. He can fine each person easily once, but other than that he's a pretty basic killer.
---
I use both of my pointers and press the bar to the beat of the struggle music.
---
Hey, another fan!
---
can't wait for it to have 40 pallets in the next update amirite
---
Besides tracking he has no real ability in a chase. YES he can shock at loops, but the slow he gets plus the charge time makes it so 9/10 times it wont matter. His only strength is tracking
---
It only takes about 10 seconds to hit someone and proc old Mom then adren pops.
---
Making assumptions, and trying to shit on people based on your own imagination is just shitty conversation. We are not stupid, so have some respect.
---
Yeah that would be an even worse thing but I never heard of it. It's weird since almost every bug has been posted and haven't seen that or isn't as popular as the abuse of wake up rn
---
Epic
---
I didn't notice until afterwards to be fair. But I have seen multiple people saying you don't need to.
---
I never want to unsee this
---
It's ironic that you are not making any counter arguments. Which proves that even to yourself your point is flat and does not make sense.
---
Agreed... Also a Hillbilly main, and Spirit’s ability to quickly end chases is almost unmatched, except for nurse. Nurse has extreme map pressure, and ends chases before they even start. Spirit struggles on very large maps when it comes to map pressure, which is why she should be in A.
---
No idea how but supposedly it increases all action speeds by 15% now. Don't know how true that is but I have been noticing shorter games when people ran it for sone reason.
---
Aside from the fact she grew up to her late twenties early thirties on her own.  She's socially stunted, not mentally stunted.
---
&gt;People should try to think like our devs do and suggest changes that incentives killers leaving the hook rather than just adding punishment on top of punishment. 
---
Yes, because this has clearly worked. No one camps anymore right? /s
---
Why are all the incentives to not camp perk based? That's a perk slot. Other than draining chaser (which is a punishment), killers can simply not run those incentive perks.
---
&gt;People camp because they want to, period. Making hook progression slower or completely paused is very unlikely to change the fate of that one survivor that everyone loves to bring in this beat up discussion. You will just make his experience more miserable by forcing him to stay in that situation for a longer period. 
---
People camp because they want to. But they do it for a REASON. Whether it's to be toxic or because in the past it had worked, they camp for a reason. If the hook progression paused, camping wouldn't be a thing. Yeah some stray trolls still may do it, but theyd still be punished when the survivor they stayed in front of escapes due to something like borrowed time as the rest of the survivors have an infinite amount of time to save the camped survivor due to the timer being paused. With a perk like borrowed time and an exit gate being opened, there's plenty of oppurtunity to save the survivor at the end if they've been camped the whole match (especially with teamwork). Less people will camp because it will literally get them no where as killer.
---
&gt;How about we make hook stages progress faster the further the killer is? Gen progress slowed if the killer isn't near the hooked person? Just some examples to change this mindset of always wanting to punish killers that will eventually reflect on players that don't camp. 
---
Why would we make hook stages progress faster away from the hook? Unlike generators, hooks dont require the killer to be in front of them holding a button in order to progress. And yes it's more of an example but it isn't a good one.
---
&gt;In case you don't know, thanks to the emblems changes currently it isn't possible to pip out of straight up facecamping every single survivor, as long as the other survivors punish the killer by doings gens. This on itself is a huge punishment but is not like campers care because they are doing this fully aware.
---
So why even bring this up? To me, this is basically saying "Punishing pips doesn't do much".
---
It's another thread about camping because it's just not enjoyable, if "it's just another thread" then maybe it should be looked into if people are annoyed by it...?
---
It works in 2 ways lol I would imagine another good combination would be Wraith and the hillbilly, His chainsaw would draw a Lot of attention making wraiths sudden movements harder to watch out for.
---
I am aware. Michael Myer's name in his movie isn't "The Shape"- In DBD he has a title called "The Shape". Ghostface's mask is based off of the painting "The Scream" so it'd make sense to make his killer title "The Scream" wouldn't it?
---
Um, no? He was just explaining that he has enough blood points to get enough Ultra-rares for a cycle of Black Incenses. Your the one who has to brag about “18 P3s” and day stuff like “Read the post before commenting to me lol” and “Stop being condescending”. Nobody gives a fuck, stop being a prick.
---
You have to patrol finished gens.
---
Yup. It was a 4 man. Having the rank 19 in the swf is the problem.  
---
Meh.. the life of a killer. FeelsBadMan
---
The one universal consatnt I have seen with every tier list is how Myers is in always near the dead middle, he is the gold standard of "balanced" killer.
---
I like your list, I would switch Freddy and Trapper. Freddy is just not hindered by his own power as much as trapper is
---
Don't even own Ash so nope on MoM.  I only started running DS post rework as it now only punishes babykillers who camp and tunnel it was broken af before.  I do run dead hard.  I fail to see how dead hard or Reworked DS is on the same planet as a free instadown for playing horribly.  Learn to apply map pressure and defend gens.  It will make you a better killer playing without the training wheels
---
I’d run Pharmacy, set up shop in the basement, and keep looting that chest so that when the Killer eventually comes down, they must confront me and my horde of 50 medkits like a dragon and their gold
---
O I N K. YOU SHANT STOP THE OINKVOLUTION
---
Ah, there it is. The guy who wants to come off as intellectual but impresses nobody. Try again? [3 continues]
---
I wouldn't like old borrowed time back. The one time use thing ruins it. "Welp, I lost my perk because I unhooked a survivor when the killer was currently chasing someone else and the tip of the terror radius was on us for a millisecond." New borrowed time is more so anti tunnel
---
Large gap between D and F, but besides that is agree
---
I feel like, if anything, Hag should be bumped up to A tier. With Make Your Choice her snowball potential is ridiculous. Plus, with her traps she can easily apply map pressure, and to an extent, shorten chases.
---
u/OnlySaysOink ?
---
The bear trap squad
---
Lmao Thumbs up
---
I bet on the Plag, i don't know what i have to do with vomit...... it's not a fear or anything..... it's just humiliating y'know, feels like you are a weak minded person and all that stuff. Such a gruesome fate
---
My biology levels ascended
---
Barely an inconvenience?
---
Is it like that all over?
---
I can feel a massive amout of salt contained within this comment
---
&gt; With a perk like borrowed time and an exit gate being opened, there's plenty of oppurtunity to save the survivor at the end if they've been camped the whole match (especially with teamwork). Less people will camp because it will literally get them no where as killer.
---
&gt; 
---
This won't change the end result for that survivor. He will still depip / safety pip because being hooked isn't part of the survivors objective towards ranking up. Having that person escape is just something for survivors to BM about. This also won't change the fact that he had a boring experience, sitting on the hook for a **longer** period of time rather than dying and joining the next match. 
---
Camping already gets you nowhere as a killer, thats the thing! You derank and barely gain any bloodpoint. 
---
You people always talk about camping being boring (which is) and at the same time, suggest something to reduce / pause hook progression. It doesn't make sense. 
---
At least be honest about it. People want paused hook progression so they have more than enough time to secure that easy escape (which already is pretty easy if the killer isn't pressuring). 
---
I am done with this discussion. I already regretted commenting in the first place because of how many time this has been discussed. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Nah u cant, they nerfed it like shit so.. its kinda useless now
---
dude... Just bind it to mousewheel...
---
Yikes! How do you know it was swf? I run solo and get matches like that.
---
This just goes to show how each players experiences are unique to them. I played all day yesterday between Xbox One and PC and didn't face one Ghostface. Not one.
---
No. If they’re the first person you find you don’t have to ignore them. It won’t make that survivor very happy, but there’s not much you can do.
---
Template please
---
yes, that's why you should start chasing the unhooker so the unhooked will waste time healing so that's only 2 survivors who are doing gens. you need to put a lot of pressure to keep them doing their objective so you can just slug the unhooked and go after unhooker to buy you more time
---
You are being ridiculous right now incredibly selective reading hypocritical bullshit. .read his post again..... She P3 so ultra rare add ons are common in the bloodweb, you should know that by now. I have 9 of them currently
---
He mentions they're P3, tells me "you should know that by now" and goes on to unsolicited provide the amount of P3's he has in 9... you with me so far?
---
I respond telling him my number (perfectly okay for him but wrong when I do it?) I then use that info to dispute his false claim that ultra rare addons become so common on P3 webs that you could run the same on "everygame" his claim.  I very specifically responded on point citing the same info he did yet I'm in the wrong somehow?  You sound like such a biased turd lol.
---
I swear end game just rewards the killer. Lol!
---
Definitely Ghostface and Myers would be a stalking force to be reckoned with, Ghostface can expose them early game and Myers can pick up late game with Tier 3, would be terrifying early game too with no terror radius lmao
---
Lol that moment you hear the struggle sound turn off for a second.
---
They’re popsicle straws
---
Thats your opinion
---
No. The Legion changes are just fine, he is counter-able and more viable than he’s ever been. 
---
Sincerely, someone who ends up playing Legion a lot and does just fine. Spamming frenzy was one of the worst things about him, it was changed for a reason. It’s not going to change back.
---
Lmao picked them up at home depot
---
not quite, but you should start finding the unhooker and the unhooked will waste time healing so that's only 2 survivors who are doing gens. you need to put a lot of pressure to keep them doing their objective so you can just slug the unhooked and go after unhooker to buy you more time
---
Then just keep the Mori aspect? 
---
Actually maybe Rancor could have the exposed effect removed completely even if all gens are done. 
---
I don't really see it as crutchy because once you shut the hatch, the odds of the last survivor powering the door rapidly approach zero anyway regardless if he's one shot or two. If there's an argument "Well by Mori-ing him he can't attempt a kobe" the game auto-sacrifices the last guy anyway. (Which should be removed. I know there's the "It's wasting everyone's time" thing but I want to go kick generators, pallets, and use my ability for deviousness etc. Maybe if I'm in a good mood I'd respect the 4%)
---
Maybe we should turn the cypress mori into basekit. It'd make getting a 4K a bit more satisfying and make the Mori daily rituals less of a hassle.
---
It’s almost like that’s the point
---
In other words, everyone above rank 11

(PLAG vomits on you)

Noice
---
It's not custom I just drew it. It's No one escapes UwU
---
If one survivor is clearly trying to run you around and clearly has adrenaline just drop the chase
---
Just dabbin' on em
---
I wouldn't say just once. Survivors randomly scream at Tier 3 and Doctor can see the auras of his illusions, which are always nearby (and pointed at) a survivor.
---
Apparently the bug is that it affects all actions during the entire trial.
---
Oi survivors, you gonna cry that a killer will use senses and predicts where you hide instead of walk like a zombie to the corner of the map?
---
Lol!  Like I said babykiller bro if you can't even entertain the possibility that it's possible to rank up without tunnels and NOED you are clearly an infant killer.  Not all of us have to crutch and bm are way to rank 1.  It is possible without tunnels and noed if you learn the game, I promise.
---
I know. But u/miztar_z can.
---
I understood that reference
---
Id say nurse is C tier, blink fatigue is a perfect opportunity to decapitate her
---
&gt;As mentioned above I’m new and struggle going against this perk but the hard part is knowing when the killer has it so help a newbie out is there any signs to look out for?
---
There is no direct sign. 
---
You can **imagine** he has NOED depending on how bad he is. More often than not, terrible killers run NOED because they suck so much.
---
Some examples are Huntress that use her default attack more than her hatchets. Nurses that rarely blink-hit. Billies that won't chainsaw even when you don't have anywhere to go.
---
True, I think it might be more of a perspective change rather than a rotation, but it still follows the 'theme'.
---
Never said I was. Takes common sense and abit of finesse to deal with insta heals. I mean, you think ds is op, that says all I need to know tbh.
---
And I oop—
---
Sorry!!!
---
well I just got full perks on ghostface p3 so it must not be that hard
---
Meg and Kate right now
---
I was making fun of this: https://imgur.com/a/X5SkXPf
---
You won’t know until after the killer hits someone when the gates are powered, if they do it’ll show the status effect after they hit someone.
---
You can also kinda tell if the killer is faster than normal after gates are powered
---
yeah me and my friend reported him on xbox and in-game
---
Wow great job. I can only draw stick figures on a good day
---
Thanks for putting that simply.
---
I feel ya there. I remember thinking that's how the whole game was going to be after trying the tutorial first thing when it came out. Yet here we are ;-;
---
If you know how to play tiles properly then getting a hit in a span of 40 seconds is entirely reasonable. If every chase takes over a minute for you to get a single hit in then unless you have gotten a really shitty map rng, you are doing something wrong.
---
Sure, in 1 game out of 10 you'll get a really good team that will probably guarantee your loss, but even against those guys you will be able to get some damage in.
---
Yeah you keep them and they’ll still work
---
Then you just go down honestly
---
Yes, you just won't get them in webs anymore.
---
What do you mean again? What happened?
---
[Don't we all.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T1wBFWbf-g)
---
This is like the most reasonable thing I've ever read on this sub. Why is it getting downvoted? 
---
If you dont want the injured person to get sacraficed, dont unhook them in the terror radius. It's the easiest thing ever unless the killer is being a campy douche, in which case you should either bait or accept the loss of a teammate and do gens.
---
I've definitely been mad because of getting downed right after leaving a hook, but I've never blamed the killer for that. When I play killer I don't think of it as my responsibility to guarantee you have a fun or long game either, same as when I play sports. 
---
I'm not letting the other team win just so they have a good day and if my teammate screws me over then they deserve the salt, not the opponent who took advantage of it.
---
As long as they have those fun counter plays  like ghostface detection everyone while love it. But just as you said before bhvr does not do that  they just buff our nerf.
---
we don’t have to because it’s true
---
Damn. May warm sand smile upon you traveler.
---
True i mean this killer got i think one hook before we finished all the gens
---
I find the best results is the get center of you screen needs to be at his head. Putting the center of the screen on his chest seems to not work much.
---
Dwight because his outfits are great for memes
---
(raises axe) *YOU LIKE?!*
---
No. ;)
---
During that time you could get a couple of gens done depending on where the hook is, plus other survivors I find normally go for the unhook.
---
It’s always weird seeing Ash killed in most games
---
Yeah, it wears me down as killer when I constantly get put with sweaty SWF that I can’t really do anything against.
---
Okay bb. ;)
---
I played plague the other day and a survivor called me a garbage braindead player for playing such an easy killer. His name was his twitch stream so I payed him a visit to say hi. He banned me when I got there then I decided to check up on him like 20 minutes later and see what he was doing. He was starting a game as legion and said "people consider legion bad so I'm going to use this an an excuse to run NOED" Then he got in game got looped for like 3 gens and said "I'm going to face camp you so hard once I get you. I don't give a shit if the other 3 get out I want to face camp you."
---
Don't take what other people say too seriously because more than half of them are hypocritical and have no clue what the hell they are talking about and that ruins all credibility they have.
---
😘
---
Can't forget about the hotfix that makes Ghostface 8% easier to spot and removing the ability to regain exposed status by restalking them.
---
Lol the end part was a joke I was merely stating that no matter how easy this game becomes for killer noed gamers would still cling to that perk.
---
There is currently no perk in the game remotely and crutch as NOED.  It is an incredibly poorly designed perk that rewards you for failure by giving you no skill mindless instadowns ad a reward for failing to protect your objectives.  There were two survivor perks that were as bad as NOED.  Old Decisive and Old MoM.  Both were reworked and completely balanced yet NOED remains as unhealthy and wildly popular as ever.
---
I'm confused are you seriously claiming reworked decisive to be a crutch lol?  It literally only functions against babykillers who camp and hard tunnel off hook.
---
I have a problem with NOED on both sides.  If you're getting gen rushed that hard your play is to blame.  You are over committing to chases and making poor decisions midgame.  If you run killer without NOED it will force you to play smarter and make better decisions.  NOED flat out stunts the growth of killers.  It  is gameplanning for failure everytime you bring it in to a game.  Aim to end every game with a gen or gens up.  Run a 4th perk that will help you midgame. 
---
I just don't know how it feels knowing you only got that down and kill because of the perk.  Personally I would feel cheap if I still used it especially since the survivor equivalents have been completely reworked and balanced on the other side.
---
I'm sorry if this is dumb, wake up is bugged? Is it not activating for exit gate speed or aura reveal? It seems to be working for me, I run it because I cant ever find the gates unless I pay close attention lmao
---
Update, - 526 Karma for defending a killer that played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.
---
I think I'll just pass out again..
---
Not annoying, fun to play as, fun to play against, not broken or exploitable and encourages a fun play style. That’s why Myers is my boi
---
Plot twist he's lying to you and he really does own all of the dlc
---
NOEeD IS BrOokENn
---
Come on!!!! Thanataphobia is my favorite perk!!! Screw it. Im not switching, I guess it counters wake up.
---
People are afraid to admit it but they overnerfed legion destroying alot of his addons and stripping away the one thing that made his ability strong (which was a a good thing by the way feral frenzy should not down people) honestly im afraid that they just aren't going to touch legion the same way the didn't touch freddy because of all the baclash legion got on release
---
I was with him
---
What do you mean “if”...
---
It was more impulse being annoyed while waiting on next match but yeah
---
That's scary
---
What did this arise from exactly?
---
Damn that’s a nice shot.
---
Probably a hidden feature the devs didn’t tell us about
---
I got faced against a Spirit with an Ebony Mori and NOED. I brought a flashlight, Spine Chill, and Iron Will. I also main Spirit so I knew how to prolong chases against her. My team thankfully cleansed totems before 2 died to the mori. 
---
Me and my other teammate got the last gen and on separate doors. I got my door open and my teammate got chased to my door. I saw her attempt to phase walk to catch up but I blinded her in phase walk, forcing her out of it.
---
It was a lovely 2 pip and 26000 bloodpoints I got. I'm glad a brought the 3 biggest counters to Spirit or else everyone would've died likely.
---
I play the majority of killers but I always find myself coming back to billy more than anyone. I just find that his play style matches mine the best
---
THERE'S MORE TO HIM THAN JUST IS FACE PEOPLE!
---
Right back at ya &lt;3
---
Love just how done Myers looks until he is challenged.
---
*joe is in the nightmares of every killer main*
---
Whats up with sprint burst, remember me, and ppay with your food?
---
Imo Hag is A tier and Ghosty boi is C tier. The rest im good with
---
If survivors genrush then you have to camp to get a kill. In purple and red ranks I've had 3 gens go off in a really short chase because the survivors usually spawn across the map from me. Sure, there are scummy killers who always camp no matter what, but there are good reasons to camp. I'll only camp if I've hooked everyone once but the gens got done quickly. I get so many immersed pussies in purple ranks that I have to derank to have fun in this game or camp to even have a chance at getting a kill. Do you know how boring that is? It's either derank or quit the game to have fun. Then the survivors are like "oh why are queue times so slow?" after events or double bp is over. No wonder so many high rank killers I've played against camp. I don't blame anyone for camping at this point
---
The only thing I agree with is that Leatherface needs a change. To stop camping, there needs to be a reason for camping to not exist. Punish campers by doing gens. Flailing your arms means the killer is camping. If you do it as a "come get me" by flailing those arms nonstop I won't get you. It'll keep a lot of campers out of high ranks.
---
I wouldn't say any these are good but if it were my decision I would: 
---
Give killers more perks to help them during a chase. Not many killers want to run gen protecting perks. You have to play Doctor to get use out of discordance in purple ranks as a lot of survivors can hit the discordance skill checks in purple ranks. With Doctor, some survivors in those ranks can't hit the skill checks. In red ranks, a bunch of them can hit all skill checks.  Possibly buff the gen protecting perks. This might remove the need to run NOED.
---
With that, give survivors a reason to run perks and builds that aren't A or B tier. Buff Small Game to add a totem counter. Buff all the not so good survivor perks so they at least have a reason to be used. I see a bunch of Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, DS, exhaustion perks, and immersed builds that I barely see anything else. Also give survivors new items, such as a broken toolbox. Make it like the broken key, but you have to bring addons  specifically for the broken  toolbox to be able to use it. Add new addons for toolboxes, new rarities too. The higher the rarity, the less likely you are to get it on a bloodweb. 
---
Nerf survivors by making gens harder to complete, but buff survivors by adding gen perks. Nerf insidious and other campy perks aside from monstrous shrine. Make it so NOED is only exposed status with tier 3.
---
This question has beed asked 78 times by now \\\[T\]/
---
lmfao
---
That pig is blind as fuck lol
---
Reveal mechanic is the only real problem. I was getting pissed off playing against Ghostface until I realized his ability is basically Make Your Choice but with a little more work involved.
---
Noed is not a crutch, its simply an end game perk. Completely counterable in multiple ways and totems are simple to find.
---
Iri hatchets require skill, I will however point out that the hitboxes and/or latency is a common cause for hits (which will be fixed with Dedicated servers). Overall, yeah ill give you that one.
---
Clown bottles with Redhead. Really? Takes skill to aim, much harder than huntress. Easy to avoid. Plus it requires a hit after the bottle hit. Not a crutch.
---
Moris are stupid, end of story.
---
Prayer beads are just over powered and limited to one killer, not a well thought out add on to the game by the devs. Can be countered by gen tapping and some basic awareness. You get half a point here.
---
Exhaustion addons? Lmfao, that is funny. So its a crutch to counter strong perks? Lol. No.
---
Insta saw billy is no longer a thing.
---
Tombstone myers, you and your team are 100% responsible for him getting t3. Good one.
---
Nurse with more than 2 blinks should be burned. Nurse should be burned. Boring to play, boring to play against.
---
If you have trouble with Plague, idk what to tell you.
---
While you have some points, most of your argument is just basic "I can't stand being exposed" bitch talk that most survivors complain about. While most can just accept it and figure out how to outplay it. Also, I never said killer was hard to play. I find this game easy for the most part, stressful sure, but easy.
---
Seriously though, burn nurse.
---
It's crazy that half of them are in the game.
---
Because Overcharge has so little going for it, that removing the surprise of the initial skill check weakens it further
---
yeah that’s true he’s real cheesy
---
I'm also tired of playing nurse I want someone who I don't need to run ruin with
---
Waaaazzzaaaaaaa!
---
I feel that Myers is better then Ghostface since he can have exposure on everyone without needing too look at him too stop it. And trapper should be c tier since I feel he is the true “ok” killer in the game since pig got nerfed into oblivion.
---
Well before the endgame starts the only real way to tell is if you can identify 4 other perks that the killer is using. Like if you can see the killer do things that for sure guarantees that they are running a perk and you can do this for all 4 of their perks then you can rule NOED out. Besides that there is no way to tell before endgame hits and that's how it should be. NOED is a very strong perk even when your not running it, or it should be. Just the threat that the killer might have NOED should be enough to make survivors break all of the dull totems. If they decide not to break all of the totems then they run the risk of falling to NOED at the endgame. However most survivors are stubborn and would rather gen rush and then cry and call the killer insults because they used NOED and call the perk OP.
---
Huntress
---
Yep I agree, I have a solution. Perk categories. Like objective perks, chase perks, tracking perks, and survival perks. You're only allowed one per category in a build unless you tilt a build one way. In which all perks have to be in that category and you can't use any other category. And in lobby you can see the tilt of the player. I think that'd be an interesting dynamic to say the least. Of course it goes both ways as killer or survivor with perk categories, instead of survival you get killing perks
---
Serious question. Why is this game so sexualized on this site? Whats with the Daddy Meyer's thing? Im just curious and not trying to offend anyone.
---
I think the philisophy of "nerfing something WAY harder than they needed to" applies in both cases with regard to balance
---
NO.
---
Where does it punish such gameplay?
---
Killer gets a safe kill and is rewarded with a less survivors to worry about.
---
Rinse and repeat until all dead - profit
---
I'd say legion belongs in c and pig in d, legion has a shorter chase and much better slow potential than most. The pigs power is honestly garbage tier atm, being stealthy means being slow and giving up map presence, her traps are pretty much a nonfactor considering the 50% chance of getting them off on the first chance.
---
I could see that being neat. Maybe a bit hard to balance gameplay wise, but something like 096 where looking at him makes you exposed and such. I could see potential
---
No. There is no punishment and BHVR don’t do anything about it.
---
It would sound better since every other killer is one word
---
I have my struggle button as F so I can constantly pay respects while on the hook
---
For one rank doesn’t mean much anymore if anything it means how much you play the game. Does that equate to skill, sometimes. I personally believe a change that could be mad is to have the perk Bamboozle be a built in mechanic for ever killer and just have the perk extend the effect. I also believe it could be good to have killers power be more designed to the chase. This is not always true but extremely helps.
---
It’s super dumb. I’m playing in Russian and first at PTB we had literally “The Ghost” (which was not yet used). And now we have “Ghost Face” written with Cyrillic symbols. There are no such words in Russian obviously, and I’m pretty sure it’s something license dependent.
---
Wraith and Clown are definitely better than Doctor and Pig, and I'd put Legion in C, but otherwise I kind of agree.
---
after new update, injured survivors are extremely loud, especially in lockers
---
The way toxic killers exercise their toxicity isn't as blatant as it is for Surviviors and plus BHVR defends toxic behavior from killers.
---
Ruin shouldn't be nerfed or buffed, it should be reworked. 
---
Survivors hate it because they make games boring. Totem hunting is boring and some killers will hump their totems. If you choose to brute force, having the generator explode because you were trying to go for the hex skill check is rage inducing (specially considering skill checks aren't smooth as they should). Hitting the good skill check is boring because on top of the flat regression, you need to wait about 4s to resume work and if you don't let go of the generator, another skill check can appear before any progress is even made!
---
At the same time, Ruin is a single totem which can be removed and RNG reliant, both making it unreliable. Often times you can progress over 50% worth of progress before getting a single skill check.
---
Bare in mind that Devs must revert the healing nerfs if they ever think about doing something towards gen progress speed. You can't continue to make the game boring for survivors. 
---
Before the healing change very rarely people would consider a waste of time to heal for 12s or self-heal for 24s. It seems like this nerf (that should've been an alternative to ruin) backfired real hard as people turned to Adrenaline and now they won't even bother healing in exchange to progressing gens faster.
---
Is you're friend a hypnotist by any chance?
---
And in PTB for localizations because they did not have time to change it yet.
---
Have you watched Home Alone?
---
Yeah I'm not sure what it had to woth DbD
---
I like how this pose seems really uncomfortable
---
Leatherface being underrated once again

WHERE CAN I BUY ONE
---
There’s more Survivor players that are also below rank 10.
---
Kill your friends. That’s how I learnt just you guys in a lobby together, no points in it and nobody’s going to target the new players.
---
You can meet up as the killer and teach them the absolute basics, gens, door opening etc.
---
All I can say, is I really, really, really like this image
---
I want “The Ghostface” bc it sounds cool and it’s not three words
---
Yeah they should make 049, he touches you and you die. 
---
That would be very balanced.
---
Isn’t Billy one of the OP killers too?
---
While I agree it’s mostly the killer’s fault for failing to defend the generators, I don’t agree that it’s “rewarding” you for failure. Most games, survivors cleanse NOED 3 minutes into the end game if they aren’t potatoes and that’s not even mentioning if they cleanse all the totems beforehand. DS isn’t a crutch , but it can be really useful. And no, “baby killers”, as you call them, don’t always tunnel because sometimes the rescued person is the only one that the killer sees since the rescuer left and the unhooked guy stays there to heal himself or didn’t run away soon enough. Don’t get me wrong, there are campers and real tunnelers, which in that case, I agree with you. Like I mentioned in my previous comment, when you get gen-rushed in a swf (I don’t like to use that term because survivors are only doing objectives), it’s almost a guaranteed 5 gens completed, unless the killer is doing REAAAALLY well. In my opinion that isn’t failure as the killer did what he could do to prevent progress as much as he could. Killers are not entitled to get 4ks and survivors are not entitled to survive everytime. If a killer is running NOED and gets at most one of them at the end, it’s still not a 4k and he will either depip or not pip at all. The rest of the overused survivor perks mentioned beforehand (except MOM and DS) can really win you the game. I lost count of how many survivors escaped because they got back to healthy state with adrenaline. NOED is the only counter to that.
---
Saw that yesterday was gonna post the same thing 😊
---
I think it's from both of them living solitary lifestyles in nature.
---
or just keep ruin the same cause its a hex perk. or is that somehow unfair to you that the survivors have a challenge in looking for a hex totem, and then taking 15 seconds to remove it from the game?
---
Especially when you see your teammates crouching in the corner, doing nothing.
---
As you mentioned in the beginning he does this a lot right? Not just DBD? If that's the case I think you guys have to start not playing with him/ making him realize that he's not the most fun to play with. I know you didn't ask for advice and this was more of a rant just to get it off your chest but it sounds like he make make a group of people all not have fun and generally put people in a bad mood and that's not something you want in a chill game with friends.
---
You need to watch the Saw movies to play DBD?
---
sure, then you are garbage in game .-. bye
---
Rip Glenock
---
Nope. However, you need to be careful in case they have Decisive Strike. Some of them will purposefully let you find them first just so they can activate DS.
---
Welcome to killer life
---
But pewdiepie already reviewed it therefore it has died.
---
Thanks for sharing this exploit to more players who will now abuse it. Smart.
---
Whoever you're playing is very  flexible and hairy
---
Would upvote, but at 666. I cant break that bind
---
You can also try swapping Nurse's with Discordance. More gen protection as well as the possibility of stalking multiple people at once. Plus it has a much longer range.
---
I can agree with this. The nurse is the best killer no doubt but the skill cap is pretty high.
---
I'd rather have SCP-106.
---
I don't know how it could work gameplay wise, but the aspect of being able to banish a survivor to the pocket dimension (Which effectively means they're NOT doing gens, healing, etc.) where they have to try and find a way out while you can optionally chase them sounds like a super cool mechanic. Basically a side-grade to Freddy.
---
Could also work with Pinhead and his Lament Configuration. I really want a killer who can basically "separate" a survivor into a completely different location and they have to find a way out, possibly under time pressure (Longer they're trapped, the more debuffs they can get that can optionally linger for a bit once they do manage to escape. Or something like EGC where they have a limited amount of time before they die similar to Pig's RBT's) or with the threat of you being able to come after them in a world where nobody else can do a flashlight or pallet save. 
---
Issue is balancing it so the power isn't useless nor too strong. Maybe there's no scratch marks in the pocket dimension so the killer has a harder time tracking you.
---
I envy you. I have hard enough time getting one Killer to max ;;
---
Its a new killer, its going to happen just as it has with every other killer. It's goes away and it hasn't even been a week yet. Give it time.
---
Lol. Happy 8th bday.
---
I was thinking about not playing with him. I play a lot of DBD and other games and he says I’m addicted and shamed me for playing a lot of SWF and I don’t care about anybody else. He also gets mad when we don’t play the games he wants to play and then he goes and buys somebody else. He got mad at us once because he died but we didn’t even kill him.
---
I have no proof of this. Just what I am inferring from what other people are saying. I don't have any survivors p3. But my p1 all I a cake with the longest taking 4 webs. It's probably some bug affecting loot on p3 webs. Pretty sure it was recently proven too that p3 webs don't actually have more high rarity items. Could be that they didnt set the odds properly on those higher webs.
---
What isn't sexualized on reddit?
---
Everybody has such bad expectations. I just chose to give a gf a 4 kill instead of taking the hatch I was standing on with a key. After I watched him walk up and stalk and then down and hook me, he sent me a message saying nice key lol. I was like why the bm? I had already got my pip and felt he deserved the 4k so I gave it to him and still got toxicity from him. What more can I possibly do?
---
Honestly i’ve had such good matches on the Asylum maps as Ghostface. Hook someone outside and then go upstairs and stalk out a window to expose those that go in for the rescue. Someone sent me a message to say it made them jump when I fell out on top of them.
---
Does the bar go slower if you mash faster?
---
Some of us only want to work on some gens while the others try to kill us 24/7.
---
Yep. Repairing, opening doors, Healing, unhooking, vaulting, and searching chests. I don't think I missed anything but if there is anyway for an action to have its speed increased then wake up will add 15% to it
---
I had this bug on PS4.
---
I went to fast vault a window but the locker was close to the window, I pressed too early and I jumped in the locker fast. Ghost Face swiped at me as I was in the locker/getting in and it registered the hit and then I teleported on top of the locker. 
---
[See here.](https://youtu.be/LyNhUuaawWs)
---
Do you not understand how a argument works? I'm not "playing the victim" (what ever that means?) I presented my counter argument to you're argument. That's how it works buddy, when someone backs out of a argument like you are it means they know they are wrong and that they are losing
---
You talking about the guy in the window? I love it when killers do things to be scary instead of outright chasing you.
---
If you do end up making a v2, please don't use black on dark, dark blue. It gets muddled and hard to see.
---
You’re playing at low ranks right?  While I agree it is fun, I can’t exactly do that at red ranks lol.
---
Literally anyone with a potato PC can dispute what you just said.
---
this is pretty good. why would you not put Plague further up tho? I'd argue she's better than both Myers and Ghostface.  
---
The counter to Plague is to not cleanse any fountains at all, but then you have everyone injured. You're basically a tier 3 Myers without the lunge and vault speed, if you see it that way.
---
Lol. I rest my case.
---
Not anymore, but I used to play it all the time.
---
The biggest thing that people need to realize is that both sides need to be fun and fairly balanced or one side will leave, making the other side not be able to play either. Likewise if you piss of a killer or group of survivors, they'll just start using their OP bullshit too and the cycle continues. (The better solution would be to not have OP bullshit, but that's another story)
---
Ah, was wondering because i came across someone with a very similar name to yours a couple of days ago
---
Isn;t that just the Spirit?
---
No, you can remain in the locker when its infected and remain healthy, but you can't leave till the sickness disappears.
---
Nurf nurs and bily buf legon.
---
Indeed burn the nurse, if you use the definition that you are using then there are no crutch perks in the game. Nothing is a crutch other then hooks and gens
---
I fucking love their videos and how you guys are mentioning it
---
I had to switch it to C just because I hate the noise the spacebar makes when you hit it so much :(
---
What did they say?
---
I can easily see it happening if you're playing against trapper. Having one dude just following you around setting off traps is a nightmare.
---
After Legion, a lot of people (including myself) gave up hope on getting Ghostface, yet here we are.
---
Even with the lawsuit, I'd say "never say never" on this one.
---
I have a buddy named RaveLordNito, I think he still plays. Haven’t talked to him in awhile tho.
---
Wish I could do this as killer but survivors get mad when I don't let them have fun
---
I guess, I’m 14? 
---
I don’t know how much it switches up but right now my W/L ratio is like 80/20.
---
Whaaaat
---
I hope not. The liability for this exploit lies solely w/ BHVR. Banning players for code they "tested" and released is just wrong on many levels. Including legal.
---
There's actually a pretty good reason for that.
---
You see-
---
*runs away*
---
Pantsless Ghostface when
---
At purple ranks atm and just had a rank 2 throw down every pallet and couldn't juke any of them. Get a lobby of rank 8s, DS, Wake up and party starters. I love this game so much.
---
Id say huntress would be comparable if her hitboxes were tuned up and iridescent hatchets didn’t exist
---
6.5-7/10 
---
But you’re good at tracking.
---
Bhvr? Consistant? HAH
---
It could be a connection issue?
---
Ghostface feels a little broken at times. I no shit looked him dead in the eye and it wouldn’t push him out of stalk
---
A reversed Ghostface would be great and fun
---
Nice! Now you have to get every perk on every killer to do random wheel builds
---
Abusing the wake up glitch I would assume
---
*Me looking at my friends while I’m in creative*
---
Why did it need a change?
---
It's okay for survivors to have a strong perk every now and then.
---
But it wasn't the 4 at same time, was 1, then others followed it
---
And deaf too
---
Surviving
---
Jeff Johansen's perk distortion will help with bbq. Not the best but it does counter it
---
Yep. They put out a news page pretty quickly when nasty +filthy blade was a glitch saying they'll ban over it but nothing with wake up so far
---
Thank u
---
Lmao actually tho I was getting so angry at the flashlight stuns after every animation
---
Leatherface shoud be c tier tbh
---
I have Jake with all the perks. He's one of the few survivors whose yelling and screaming I can tolerate, with the exception of his injured moans.
---
Let's not forget that by cleansing yourself you've created a new monster that vomits horrendous deadly acid at you instead of vomit now too. A thick black bile corrosive enough to down you from 30 feet away.
---
That Ace is a bad representative for all the fellow Ace's out there.
---
Actually true but everyone acts like it's normal to act this way.
---
Weren’t all the Ghostface killers just angsty high school teens?  Myers is a literal counter pick lol.
---
A rank 4 survivor should never be going up against a rank 15 killer.
---
Need to remove legion from this game...
---
Me and some boys played as the Quentin Squad the other day. We weren't running Wake Up! or anything, we were just running Quentin. I think he says it best:
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/xcaustic/clip/CrispyAuspiciousWhalePermaSmug](https://www.twitch.tv/xcaustic/clip/CrispyAuspiciousWhalePermaSmug)
---
I was under the assumption that deranking never went away. It could have been a SWF were someone saw something, like the PIG traps, or one got disconnected so they all left. Or just a chain reaction. 
---
Depending on the killer, I never DC when that happens as most likely they end up wanting to farm and I don't mind the easy bloodpoints.
---
What did he get banned?
---
I switched to macros after wearing out two keyboards.  I will never go back.
---
I don't get it... Lol
---
The match had just started, eventually two or three started screaming, and not soon after three of them DC'd. I'd have let the last one farm, but they got to the hatch first. I don't know why people DC against Doctor (especially a new one, like I am).
---
That's dbd for ya
---
More like this please
---
They should make it use skill checks, with failing making your health bar go down faster, and successful checks slowing it down.
---
In my Opinion, The Spirit stands more of a chance against Ash than you think.
---
First, she is most likely more intelligent than Ash. Pre-killer Rin attended a University. Ash is a life-long drug user, even through High School. I understand Education is not EXACTLY equal to intelligence, but hey at least Rin is not constantly drunk or high.
---
Second, The Spirit has a proper weapon. Most of the other killers just have knives, or improvised weapons. However The Spirit has a Katana, a weapon made for war. This is a much higher quality weapon compared to most of the other killers weapons.
---
Lastly, The Spirit's phase-walking ability is not only amazing for ambushing an enemy, but it also contributes to mind-games. Phase-walking leaves behind copy of Rin that does nothing. This could severely confuse Ash in a fight.
---
Ultimately I think it is likely The Spirit will always score the first hit due to her extraordinary ambush capabilities. However The Spirit has the disadvantage of being very fragile compared to most other Killers. If you compare The Spirit's bodily build to The Huntress, The Huntress obviously is much larger and more muscular.
---
Factoring all of this in, I think Ash wins 4/10 with weapons, because The Spirit can phase-walk and easily score the first hit. However, The Spirit is very fragile so this could mean trouble later in the fight IF Ash figures out what she is capable of doing. Heavy emphasis on "IF" because Rin is most likely far more intelligent than Ash. Keep in mind, theoretically, if The Spirit can get far away enough from Ash after she is done phase-walking, she can do slow hit-and-run style attacks.
---
I think Ash would win 0/10 without weapons because The Spirit has a very high quality weapon, and scoring the first hit is even easier because The Spirit has no concern of getting hit by Ash swinging his chainsaw around. After the first hit, The Spirit could just hack and slash at Ash with no fear of being hit by a deadly weapon. Even if Ash grabbed The Spirit, she could possibly phase-walk as a last resort.
---
Billy is one of the strongest killers and by far the easiest to play out of the top 3.
---
Those 3 were probably swf and are pussies that dc when they face a certain killer. Those 3 probably dont play unless they're in a swf group.
---
By defensive capabilities I mean that survivors are unable to body block vs a leatherface most of the time because of his ability to hit multiple targets at once, not that he can camp well. Any killer can camp if they want to, that was not my point. 
---
I do hope Freddy gets a good rework to make him viable. But let's be honest, Leatherface is just better than him enough to move him out of the same tier as Freddy. His power grows considerably when he gets good add-ons, but his power is still inferior to leatherfaces. 
---
I am not saying that Bubba can defend gens better than an average killer, I 100% agree that he is not great at it, only thing I am trying to say is he is better than Freddy at it, and deserves the D tier, even if he's at the end of it.
---
Looks a bit like scars to me.
---
Yeah, science!
---
When you're so strong you stab through an axe blade
---
Seeing the same tired joke over and over gets really annoying. especially when the pig fanbase is one of the more annoying parts of this community. when they spam their memes everywhere, "Haha she's so cute" "haha her stun sound!!!" "Oink!" Im tired of it and im positive in not the only one.
---
Because people hate the effects the Madness gives to them like 1. Flashing images of the doctors ugly ass face 2. Some people get headaches from the shock effect and they don't want to deal with it. 3. It's really hard to sneak away from the doctor plus hitting skill checks is annoying when you have madness. That's all the reasons I got for why people DC against Doc
---
Y’all thinking about Candy Man but he really means The Bee
---
The Creeper. He is known as the "creepy killer" in-game deacription.
---
You people give the pig main community a bad name, nobody likes shifting through miles of "OINK XDDD CALL PIG AMANDA PLSS \^\^"s to find stuff worth reading
---
Instead of killing the survivor quickly the killers have to put them to the hook
---
It's pretty difficult to do in red ranks. I got this achieve like 2 years ago, but that is how I did it back then. I rapidly deranked my killer rank, waited like 2 months for a free weekend before playing anymore killers, and then got it in my first try on a free weekend.
---
Letting them get to another pallet can end up in a 2 gen chase if they are in a good location, at red ranks anyway.
---
You can never balance a game where players that have the ability to communicate are matched with players and killers who don't. It's really as simple as that.
---
Please insert 25¢
---
Im not even part of the community, it was more annoyance at the bitchy snitching
---
It's been a thing, and will always be a thing until BHVR does something more punishing than ban threats.
---
I was playing killer and this happened twice, I felt so bad but there was nothing I could do. I shot both those dudes a message apologizing for the mishap, but they were cool enough to shrug it off and not go off on me
---
I didn't realize til after I posted it
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that
---
cause that be a swf group bruh, it aint fair to begin with
---
Thanks man. Always the best compliment when people think it's people
---
The devs really need to restrain the ranking when it comes to SWF; they shouldn't be allowed to have too many ranks inbetween players in the group. Either that, and/or the SWF group should be put in a match with a killer equally ranked or around the rank of the highest ranking survivor in the group.
---
Killers just need perks that affect gen progress more efficiently. Ruin is the best we have, but when you're a solo player at rank 13 with dumb teammates who are all out looking for it and getting hooked, it really sucks to just sit there repairing a gen for an extra minute because of the SC RNG causing them to pop up several times in a row. 
---
As a Killer, it sucks to even have a perk that can be destroyed and taken from me. I don't like using Ruin, but like I said, it's all we have. Overcharge isn't that effective, PGTW got a slight buff but it's still not that effective, Tremors only effects gens *not* being repaired, and Divine Corruption is temporary. If we can get a perk that does increased regression speed, then I think we can start phasing out Ruin to some degree.
---
Ah I stand corrected then
---
*ill be sure to delete those ;)*

---
*(smiles with dirty thoughts in head)*
---
All actions have increased speeds
---
explain to me how the rank 18 survivor with no mither got away
---
Even if it’s just his green and red sweater, it’s be perfect. Myers needs H2018 stuff, Leatherface needs his Pretty Lady Outfit- I know it’s not that easy, but I’m hoping BHVR will be more willing to pursue licensed cosmetics after the reception people had to Ash, Ghostface, and Pig+Tapp.
---
sometimes?
---
I think they just need to make it where he is easier to break out of.   
---
The 1 second instead of 1.5 and nerfing his addons (as well as making it where he can't stalk those already stalked) seems pointless and just makes him worse, and he already gets held back by gens as much as people like wraith and trapper
---
Wth that needs to be patched ASAP or the perk disabled. Jesus.
---
them ankles are scandalous
---
Plague is the only killer I haven’t played mostly because I took a break from dbd when she came out and she didn’t really appeal to me that much but what I can gather from the community and my limited experience against her as a survivor C tier seems about right but tbh I’m quite unsure. By the time she has infected everybody a good portion of the gens are done and at high ranks the the remaining ones you can get looped. But from my perspective she looks like a good killer and I can understand the argument that she is B tier
---
The thing about Freddy is that if you are a freddy god, then you gain less results then average hillbilly. At least leatherface can smacc people easily and down ppl with chainsaw sometimes.
---
The Hehe
---
Or threaten to ban people and do something about it like Legion's forever mend.
---
Anything that changes the Environment lags it out worse than that too.
---
Ive met Doctor mains on console who pkay him just because of the lag and they know they'll win. Ive also met Killer mains that refuse to play Doc because it's a bitch move and easy win.
---
this needs more upvotes
---
you can use the mousewheel its so much more confortlba´pgokrpoj
---
Well they could always change that what if instead  the entity was moving the arm trying to stab them and getting the skill checks is the survivor dodging or catching it. If you actually look at the animation they hold the spike back then I goes up then stabs them cause the survivors puts there hands up which is weird it's like the survivor just gives up and it stabs there gut it just looks silly.
---
It's super different from the end game sac animation where they get stabbed underneath from underground get surprised then just ruined
---
r/ihadastroke
---
O.K. Leatherface Main.
---
SCP would be awesome but has to be the right one
---
People hate playing against Doc. He’s not amazing but him and Freddy are noob stompers for sure. 
---
He’s very fun to play don’t let the Dcers deter you from playing who you like.
---
!knio knio kniO !kniO
---
Going offensive are you?
---
He's not a friend he's a douch
---
Just get over it, it's better lose these friends than get them. Play with whom you enjoy spend time with. Our lives are too short to spend free time with somebody who doesn't appreciate that
---
No but they cope at red ranks better than the killers below them at least from my experience.
---
Probably good at hiding.
---
Explain to Me How Rank even Matters
---
Probably because they were being carried by the rank 4, and being stealthy.
---
Rank doesnt really matter when it comes to swf to be honest. I’ve seen plenty who are green ranks and you click on their profile and its like “2,860 hours played”.
---
They need to change this rank reset.
---
No, it’s just that you’re clearly biased and not willing to accept other’s opinions because you spent five bucks on a video game character.
---
At least you got 20k and 2 kills that’s at least a pip. But yeah i understand but ya gotta look on the bright side!
---
I guess he has to become black now 😯
---
Well they are role playing a psychopathic killer... controlling behavior is not the highest on my list of surprising behavior :P
---
Regardless, a newer killer shouldn't be going up against a more experienced/longer-playing survivor at any point.
---
Nope been rank 1 survivor for years man.  Again bad assumption and weak players use noed all through rank 1.  I soloqueue so unfortunately taking out 5 dulls myself isn't realistic.  I'll take out 4 myself and still rat the Billy's noed lol.  Randos don't cleanse.
---
Yeah.. as said in other instances they should just put the banner saying there's X glitches and not use them or will be punished since they are monitoring them (as they also stated)
---
Add a news isn't so difficult to do, I wonder why they haven't done it yet..
---
A rank 18 survivor shouldn't be going against a rank 15 killer either but that's life. It's not fair.
---
"Don't know what to say but you got outplayed for sure" What is that comment lmao.
---
So many bugged things this patch and some people don't have the basic human decency to not abuse them.
---
15% buff/debuff is ridiculously annoying and I'm hoping for a soon fix.
---
Spirit is definitely A tier but not S. She requires good-ons, especially in larger maps as her base ability is rather slow.
---
Just out of curiosity... what's to stop someone from posting the griefer's gamer tags and what they said here - or somewhere - just so the community could enjoy the salt together? I'm not saying it's a good idea... but would there be consequences like from Playstation/Xbox/Steam? Could reposting someone's tag and comment online get you banned? 
---
I suppose it wouldn't change anybody's behavior... most people who take the time to send me a salty message I assume would love the extra attention.
---
So you played well and you played to your strong point and he got mad. Yeah it’s annoying going against god loopers but that’s kind of the killers choice on how long he wants to waste to get one guy down.
---
They need to change how matching up killers and survivors works. Both sides should never be going up against an opposition who's very far above them. Likewise, SWF should not be able to join up with other people who are very far above/very far below each other in rank.
---
Rough day bud?
---
Congrats! Now what?
---
#QuellTheQuentin
---
Dude do you research. Many things you said has been tried and guess what.. survivors abused the shit out of it
---
Wanna make them stop camping? Do gens and get out of rank 20-15. That's it
---
Well that fucking sucks. He actively made posts, the majority of which were more then just "Oink" but genuine posts. Most recently https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c3057k/killers_described_by_my_parents/
---
Not once is the word Oink said in that entire thread.
---
The only thing I'd take issue with is that Oink and such posts do fall into a possible interpretation of spam. But even then shouldnt he be told to stop instead of perma-banned? Thats a way, way disproportionate punishment for technically breaking 1 rule.
---
Mods should remember that the upvote/downvote system exists for a reason, the subreddit can filter its own content. If Glen0cks posts were truly annoying people they'd be downvoted.
---
You shouldnt ban someone active in the community because you dislike them.
---
At least rank 18 is around rank 15. A rank 4 survivor should never be going against/with either of us.
---
how it feels playing doc on ps4
---
Honestly I wouldn’t waste a perk slot for Distortion. Sure it’s an alright perk but with that bbq nerf along time ago you don’t need Distortion. As soon as someone’s knocked down just go to a locker or do it when he gets picked up. Other alternative is to be in terror radius.
---
Am I? I am not denying the things you've said. But out of every thing you've said i can't find anything that makes LF F tier
---
Big lol

---
Looks like lag on your end. Seeing that Claudette creep up and hide instead of spazzing out about where she is doesn't exactly scream lag switch.
---
Alright I respect your opinion, fellow dbd player
---
Zero kills lol
---
Agreed, this guy is just salty. Wants to blame the game for not getting a 4k even though the 2 perk Rank 18 no mither survivor also escaped
---
… That literally has nothing to do with my point. Getting any number of kills is fine. A rank 4 survivor going against a rank 15 killer is *not* fine. I even said this in my comment on this post. 
---
Also, "typical killer main", lmao. I haven't played killer in quite a while. I play survivor more.
---
I think all platforms
---
Because if we don't keep control of the situation the survivors tend to walk beside their shoes and try to T-bag you behind a pallet and then they get mori'd instead when they could've just let you carry them. We just want to know we can do some good and give people some extra points, don't ruin it by being yourself and turning us into our beasts without guilt.
---
Only been playing for about 2 weeks.
---
The low-ranked survivors would know that they were going up against a higher-ranked killer. They'd choose to make that choice. The higher-ranked survivor, likewise, would know they had to carry them. You queue up with lower-ranked survivors, you're making the choice to carry them. On that note, the killer does not choose to and has no idea they are going against higher-ranked survivors.
---
..........
---
Game is real. There.
---
Maybe if you stop camping
---
Hag is bae.
---
That's beside my point.
---
They don’t really have it harder in my opinion but survivor is heavily based on team work for a full escape to happen. Most of the time, you’re gonna have random solo survivors matched up with no communication, which makes it easier for you. 
---
I don’t have fun if it’s too easy. I’ve more often than not carried the last survivor to the door and opened it or to the hatch. I also do this for anyone who impresses me... Like a Claudette who actually crawled across the map to get to the open exit. I helped her the rest of the way.
---
My strawman? What strawman? The only thing I argued was that they didn't try the slow hook progression with the exceptions.
---
I'm almost positive in the future something will be done with camping/tunnelling, I don't think it'll be these changes but something most likely will be done. If only your response didn't make you seem so belittling.
---
Are you all doing survive with friends? It's known to completely fuck up matchmaking. Maybe try solo queue for a while.
---
My goodness
---
I'm normally not one to complain about a setup, but Ruin, BBQ, Nurse's, and NOED on Nurse. Holy fuck, you're mean.
---
Thought im the only one who thinked that
---
The entity is in an alternate dimension, and lore wise, exists within our multiverse. It has scooped horror icons from their realities, due to the fact that it is not tied to one specific universe to steal people. So in theory, DbD does exist within the multiverse, because it interacts with many different dimensions. The only two game characters (besides corresponding dlc characters) that are confirmed to be in the same world are the Trapper and Benedict.
---
You contradict yourself, you being a prat and fucking up and getting hooked *IS* being nice to killers. We get a good laugh out of it.
---
Because if mods dont like what youre posting, then they use their "power" to ban.
---
Finally, it took three tries but you got there in the end.
---
Congratulations you could've probably P3 them with the event also like I did with my Ghostface in 3 days. But yeah first prestige is always a feel goodoment
---
I struggle to find a reason that this post would be removed...
---
Also I play a great deal of killer and am very experienced with rank 1 games there too.  I took NOED off my killers the moment they started rebalancing the game for us with all the survivor nerfs and killer buffs starting with the pallet vacuum update.  It felt cheap to run it still seeing how much easier it became to end our chases efficiently.  I don't understand how hating a single perk that exists solely to mask poor killer play makes me entitled or biased.  I play both sides through rank 1 and I hate noed crutch equally on both sides.  Noed downs feel cheap and unearned.  I'd rather simply accept my loss as opposed to running a no skill crutch to compensate for the fact that I got outplayed by my opponents.  Honestly though playing killer without it does make you learn to play optimally.
---
Came here to say exactly this.
---
Well, they only got the rights to the mask from Fun World, not the movies.

---
Commenting to follow as I am having connection issues similar to yours.
---
There has been many ideas for different game modes but it's already pain to find lobbies on certain ranks so I don't believe we can afford to split the player base.
---
&gt;My strawman? What strawman? The only thing I argued was that they didn't try the slow hook progression with the exceptions.
---
When I said that camping would make you depip so the higher you go less people would camp and strawman it saying I said that camp 1 time puts you on rank 15. Jeez you don't even notice when you strawman someone? That's sad
---
&gt;I'm almost positive in the future something will be done with camping/tunnelling, I don't think it'll be these changes but something most likely will be done. If only your response didn't make you seem so belittling.
---
Probably but not using those dumb ideas for sure. You don't incentives someone to leave the hook by punishments but by rewards. It's been studied from decades, teachers teach you this in the middle school.. if you wanna really stop that I would incentives them with fresh hooks rewards so I would eliminate camping and tunneling at the same time.
---
There will be camping killers for sure but they won't be as much especially in high ranks where there are almost none if not in very rare occasions
---
What is 'noed?'
---
Tell that to the 1000 Ebony Moris I saw during double BP
---
No one escapes death.
---
Between unnecessary wear and tear and already having some nerve damage I'll never do mashing if I don't have to. Also, mechanical keyboard space bars are obnoxiously loud when spammed like that. If I'm playing at 1am I don't want to wake my partner up!
---
It kinda sucks what happened to legion in this regard. Their ability to borderline ignore pallets sounded like something that could have an insanely powerful learning curve in controlled hands.
---
How all legion does is cry when a pallet is thrown down
---
More like getting Gen rushed  because you have no pressure and you just kicked out of your ability.
---
You right 😂
---
It's allways funny when people unironically call NOED broken.  
---
"Here you got 4 counters to that average perk."  
---
"B-But then I have to actually do something besides gens, looping and t-bagging? A-And that one time when I went to that facecamping dude to save my SWF buddy he smacked my face with NOED! Crutch Perk! Totally broken!"
---
lol I love Jewelry Box because you can go around stalking in tier 1 and you pretty much move the same speed. It's hilarious.
---
Yeah.. what about that?
---
Lol. She doesnt require add ons at all. Maybe when you play.
---
Just bring Ruin lmao
---
Name checks out
---
Honestly I think this is a perfect explanation of why endgame was made lol
---
You forgot your flashlight
---
But they just find it and break it instantly. Man I'm unlucky
---
wig.
---
Have all perks for all killers.
---
Only use M&amp;A, BBQ&amp;C, Ruin and Nurse's on any given one.
---
Trapper is way too low, his pink add ons are super good and is overall great for tracking and punishing survivors, especially counting he entirely counter any infinites or loops, meaning a good trapper can find you and have you hooked in barely a minute if he herds you the right way. A good trapper can rip apart an uncoordinated team and even a coordinated one, just depends on who’s play trapper
---
Alot of things became bugged with the new update. Wake Up! Is broken, Legions blade add ons are broken, again, Thanataphobia is broken, STBFL is broken, basically every perk is broken now. Its been a real pain to play both killer and survivor. Also im pretty sure legions blade addons are infinite mending again, as well as slowing everything else down.
---
Yeaaah, it sucks that its luck based
---
Victor Miller and Sean Cunningham are in a legal battle as Victor wasn’t properly compensated for the first screenplay and under copyright law he could take back his works from Sean.  Sean and Horror Inc. fought back and now started this huge battle for the rights to Friday the 13th.
---
Its not. You are complaining about going against a high rank, when there was a rank 18 with no mither and only 2 perks who also escaped.
---
And its not like you had a bad game you got 20k points pretty decent game
---
Don’t worry fam, it’s recharging next to the camp fire
---
You're no fun, I see.
---
The Kill Rate stats very much favor Killers far beyond Rank 8.
---
I have so many Killer Main streamers complain about how OP Survivors are, then the match ends and they finish with 3 Kills and Pip.
---
I thought emblems were fucked but I have been getting merciless killer every game with GF recently. I think the vfx bug makes him insane.
---
I like how it's litterally basically the entity pulling the trailer of pallets and there isn't any truck
---
What is morie'd?
---
If it starts at the end of the 5th, it will be halfway down by the time someone gets to a gate depending on where people are

(In case you couldn’t tell, it’s the perks.)

Red rank survivors are just yellow rank survivors who happened to unlock all of the crutch perks 
---
CHANGE MY MIND
---
The entity duh
---
&gt;Game Developers: You are free to create and share videogames based on SCP, but you must comply with all aspects of the license as it relates to software. That means releasing the work under CC-by-SA-3.0, including the release statement prominently on any store page the game is distributed on (as well as developer websites and the like), releasing the game without DRM if the game costs money (steam and the like have developer options for this), not imposing additional legal restrictions through EULAs or equivalent user forms, and not attempting to impede any alternate distribution sources so long as those sources in turn follow the terms of the license.
---
Dunno how that relates to DBD's situation, but they did say you can make money off of it but can't have DRM which DBD has I think. It really is a mess when it comes to licensing.
---
when you record with your phone while driving
---
Yep that's why I run Thrilling Tremors because it's actually not luck based and stops gen progress or show the other Survivors locations. But it's only tier 1 making it kinda useless. I hate the bloodweb so much
---
Well jotaro won that fight in the end  so now wot?
---
So, basically can't make any real money off of them in most cases, lol.
---
Doctor is the DC king
---
Well Im baby and I play on 20-35fps so it's pretty hard to even see
---
I skipped after the clown, noticed too many mistakes.
---
Plague can't use some perks, but she also doesn't need them. thanataphobia is good on her in red ranks. 
---
Having 4 survivors that are always 1 shot, crying, and bleeding, or worse, is something legion and plague have in common. That's an absolute win.
---
Alauly.
---
If Siege can remove clash and claymores for an exploit, behavior can remove a shit perk to keep the game stable
---
Was about to ask why you'd want to hunt an already-endangered species but then remembered the whole Wake Up epidemic
---
Do what you have to do :(
---
I dont even know what to say to this..
---
Yes it just sucks never being able to catch anyone lol.  Personally I like running monitor and abuse with dead rabbit.  You can really scare the hell out of people with it because you have almost no terror radius in tier 1
---
So the high ranked survivor finally got his friends in real life to get the game and then rather than them being able to enjoy the game together the friends have to get stomped while the teammate has to try extremely hard to win causing no one to have fun. Stop being a bitch, move on with your life and go into another game. Just because the high ranking player probably made a show of you and embarrassed you does not mean he shouldn’t be allowed play with his friends. No one cares about rank nor do the developers(hence no rewards for ranks) it’s just for fun and you should be grateful to play against someone as experienced as you only get better by playing against people who are better than you. “The game is too hard please nerf it :(“ is the equivalent to saying to an examiner “please make the questions on the test easier it’s too hard”. Grow up rank means nothing play the game then move onto another one.
---
1. be close to the hook (either be at the edge of the terror radius or a bit further)
---
2. Hide in a locker, until the "hook bubble" expires
---
3. Hide at the back of a generator, crouching so that the gen aura blocks yours (risky but worth it, doesnt work on all gens / maps)
---
4. Whenever the surv is hooked, go into one direction to fake, wait for the bubble to expire and walk the other way (high risk)
---
5. as mentioned: distortion. But it only has 3 charges and can easily be triggered from nurses calling, bitter murmur, (blood warden), deerstalker, I'm all ears, rancor, territorial imperative or other addons from killers (mirror myers, clown toxic gas addon shows 6s the aura, doc madness increase addon shows the aura etc).
---
Jake and Adam
---
Hnnnnnnnn

You all need to look into AutoHotkey. I have a toggleable script for struggling and the second phase of being hooked - I simple press F6/F7 to turn it on and off.

Did you seriously down vote me bc of my flashlight?
---
Oink.
---
Pig=Upvote
---
If you are the last survivor alive, you automatically get put into struggle.
---
Correct
---
I’m bummed because wake up is actually a niche perk I like to use every now and then and I can’t use it since it’s busted and I don’t wanna get in trouble.
---
That scream was priceless
---
&gt;When I said that camping would make you depip so the higher you go less people would camp and strawman it saying I said that camp 1 time puts you on rank 15. Jeez you don't even notice when you strawman someone? That's sad
---
I was using an example. The point is that you can camp and you can be camped at any rank, the example was that a killer can camp a whole match then simply pip the next to maintain the rank. 
---
&gt;Probably but not using those dumb ideas for sure. You don't incentives someone to leave the hook by punishments but by rewards. It's been studied from decades, teachers teach you this in the middle school.. if you wanna really stop that I would incentives them with fresh hooks rewards so I would eliminate camping and tunneling at the same time.
---
The idea is to discourage camping. Incentives clearly don't work. The only incentives I see other than the fact that you'll earn more bp overall if you don't camp (which could almost be seen as a punishment) are perks like bbq, but they can simply choose not to run perks like bbq. If they stay next to hook, everybody's possible bp gain suffers. Incentives will NOT eliminate camping nor tunnelling, unless the incentive is in the gameplay itself (which it's not. You seem them add perks like bbq to discouraging camping and hooking multiple people). 
---
&gt;There will be camping killers for sure but they won't be as much especially in high ranks where there are almost none if not in very rare occasions
---
Again, people will camp at any rank. The fact that you claim that you won't see many campers at higher ranks kinda favors my idea of punishing, as the emblems punish players who don't perform their role well, and camping is ineffective at applying pressure to every survivor who isnt hooked.
---
stop lewding the fucking characters
---
I mean  you got OoO to completely counter Ghostface atleast I think you do kinda hard to tell.
---
Can you equip it again?
---
Unnerving on skillcheck boxes is exactly what you don't want though. Giving good survivors skillchecks just means they search faster :c *sad oinks*
---
*sighs* I remember this.... This innocence. You've plenty of room to grow little one
---
If I do stay, it's either so I know my teammates are safe (unless they are waiting for hatch) or because I want to give the killer extra points. I get mad when I see other survivors just waiting there to troll :( it makes other killers want to play toxic against us
---
The two things I love the most, what more could I ask for
---
You called? ^^oink
---
*I'm sorry what's a...pallet? Also, can you go through stuff? Because I can*
---
Nah David/Jake is. Although that technically came from the devs not community, whether it's intentional or not.
---
Yeah quality kinda sucks. But overall, like come on entity!
---
Equip what?
---
How 6 foot girls see 5,10 guys
---
I think it's because people don't put themselves in others' shoes. They don't know what it's like to experience being on the other side of things. This applies to real life and this game!
---
I still don't understand the reason why either even after it being discussed [on the down low] in the discord.
---
Before the wake up bug, I always spared Quentin. Until they fix it, none shall live.
---
Yep still haven't seen Thrilling tremors on my Ghostface or BBQ or any good perk. I think everyone hates the entity
---
Bunny mommy can carry me around and aggressive shove a hook through me any day *moans in oink*
---
What do you want survivors to do? Stand around? Unless you are talking about the bug this patch, then yeah that's a fair complaint.
---
&gt; Just because the high ranking player probably made a show of you and embarrassed you does not mean he shouldn’t be allowed play with his friends 
---
I literally said nothing about what went on in the match. **Do not put words in my mouth**.
---
That's just one situation you cherry picked to try to uphold your argument.  
---
&gt; it’s just for fun and you should be grateful to play against someone as experienced as you only get better by playing against people who are better than you. “The game is too hard please nerf it :(“ is the equivalent to saying to an examiner “please make the questions on the test easier it’s too hard”. Grow up rank means nothing play the game then move onto another one.
---
The irony of saying no one cares about rank and that going up against a higher-ranked player makes you better, while trying to argue that survivors shouldn't be forced to go up against the equivalent of the highest-ranking survivor in the group's rank. Big oof on your part. Grow up yourself.
---
Do be like that sometimes
---
whooosh
---
I thought it was supposed 2 be 50¢
---
Now for a survivor one ;)
---
Wtf does that even mean
---
That is literally beside my point. It's the principal of the thing. Not what actually went on in the match.
---
Weak players dont make it to rank 1 so your story is full of some holes there mate.  If you run NOED as a killer past rank 8 prepare to be disappointed 9 times out of 10.  The fact that it has such a hard counter makes it balanced.  I get that its annoying to you but just say that.  Just because you dont like it doesn't make it a bad, crutch, or OP perk.  And it is not a reflection on a players skill whether they decide to use it or not.
---
And they're letting pallet stuns break him out of shroud
---
A very long time ago when there were afk farming bots it was asked if macro's were bannable. They stated it was bannable if used for afk farming, but other then that it is not.
---
I have used a macro for struggle, wiggle, and flashlight spamming since the beginning of 2017. I refuse to break my +$100 mechanical keyboard due to some asinine game mechanic.
---
I do feel like NOED is a little too strong. What bothers me is that the killer doesn't need to put in any effort to benefit from the perk. Meanwhile there is this perk that requires you to hook the obsession 4 times to get a smaller terror radius inside a chase...
---
Probably will get downvoted for this, but NOED is  indeed a crutch perk. I used to equip NOED all the time before I found my way to reddit, then I saw how controversial the perk was and I tried playing without it. Thats when I realised how much I relied on the perk. I never bothered with pressure because NOED would get me the kills in the end anyways.
---
&gt;4 counters
---
I'd like to know what counters you're talking about. Pretty sure that cleansing all dull totems is one of the counters, but "just cleanse all dull totems" is terrible advice, you're better off spending that time on rushing gens and then dealing with NOED afterwards. The best advise when it comes to cleansing is basically "cleanse well hidden totems and totems far away from the gates" then when NOED does come in play, it's easier to find. But when you try to cleanse all totems and you miss one, it's most likely the best hidden one and then you're screwed.
---
(Not saying that I don't use the perk from time to time, when I have a few games where survivors piss me off, you bet I'll equip NOED)
---
&gt;Managed to win by using the Necronomicon to banish Freddy to hell as well as Jason.
---
Holy fuck, I need to read that comic.
---
OMG.. incentives won't eliminate them but most likely less people would do that
---
Your naive approach is just to punish them right away. Then let's punish who camp hooks survivors side too. If they save someone before 15s has passed they get instadowned and can be moried.
---
Your point is just to punish whoever don't play your way
---
Look this argument isn't new, it's the oldest thing brought up since the release of the game and certainly you're not the one who would stop it or give new ideas since I can't see any.
---
I won't even bother to reply, just look at the THOUSANDS of discussion about it and see yourself. Your topic was dead before was posted
---
#ANGERY
---
Videos?
---
I dunno if they could contact the creator directly to get around some of the issues.
---
I think it'd be easier to get the Hellraiser license and just add Pinhead. I want a killer who doesn't have to be viable but is fun at toying with survivors or otherwise turning them into playthings while being oppressive (Harsh, feels like you're hopeless once separated into the puzzle box/pocket dimension, often escaping by the razor's edge) to survive against. 
---
Red Paint Brush M&amp;A Freddy on Lery's or Rotten Fields scratches that itch (Always knows where you are, no terror radius and can be around any corner) but he's being reworked, and I've love a killer who's entire power makes you feel like you're in a world of shit so I can do this without certain addon combinations or maps.
---
To be honest, I kinda hate it. It ruins any intimidation factor that the killers have :/ They are just as much survivors as the survivors are. There is no sense of suspense or tension or urgency. It is just another monotonous cycle of daily work to amuse something you don't even agree with. It is just a corporation.
---
If there is ever a sequel to Dead by Daylight, it should be where the killers and survivors banded together to destroy the entity and rob it of its power before turning on one another again.
---
and what about the survivors who are just bringing med-kits,maps or even no items? I guess not so when you bring a ebony mori get a 3/4K by playing scummy for the whole game with this attitude "I've got to get them first before they get me" only to see that none of them were using wake up.
---
Why is it okay if not outright praised when killers have a bad match against survivors and so they decide to run a very strong build and take it out on survivors who had nothing to do with it. 
---
But i guess it's because "kIlLeRs ArE nEvEr ToXic!" Jeez players like this part of the problem especially since they try to justify their scummy tactics with the old excuses we have all used as kids. "They started it!" Though since killers can see add-ons it more along the lines, "they might start it!"
---
Darn Freddy isn't even on there
---
MalO is a phone app be hard to but it be neat if shy guy was in there
---
Old man Jake = Best Jake.
---
Next killer confirmed
---
&gt;Getting any number of kills is fine.
---
Me, in another comment. **Do not put words in my mouth**. I said nothing about the number of kills I got. In my comment on this post, which you obviously didn't read by the way, I mentioned how a rank 4 survivor should never be going against a rank 15 killer. It's the principle of the thing.
---
**Rule 3** - Shaming other players.

---
Some places are controversial, I know, but my mind isn't setting in stone.
---
For example, I am not sure about Ghost Face's placement, I know he can be better than Myers in some situations, but he's also weaker than him in other situations and he's gonna get nerfed. His placement might change after I see more game play with Ghost Face.
---
Freddy isn't here because he's gonna get a rework very soon.
---
I mean, with Legion, it was a combination of 2 addons that totaly broke the game. With wake up, it's 1 perk that gives you a slight unfair advantage
---
I already said why :).
---
If you're doing it to survive, it's not toxic. (Toxic would be like t-bagging or chasing the killer just so you can blind them for no reason)
---
If it give more time, it would defeat the purpose of starting after the fifth generator, wouldn't it? After the last generator is activated, you have nothing to do other than open the gates or teabag the killer, if the last is true, you definitely don't need extra time
---
4 survivors running wake up leader and prove thy self.
---
I'm probably the guy you hating right now since Iv been tbagged so many times and now it's redemption time baby. How you like them bags? Earl grey... Bitch.

Death by snu snu.
---
Decisive Strike is still very good tho. For a death perk, a lot of survivors are still using it at red ranks.
---
Well yeah, the entity uses the killers for entertainment, and tortured them for who knows how long to make them obedient enough to play its game.
---
It’s really annoying because it always sounds like they’re right next to you
---
Well i dont mean a lot of time i mean like 1 extra second for a bodyblock or like 3-5 seconds for a hook save or something like that
---
In terms of gameplay, what does that mean?

I didn't even see the post I was that early

Never put words in your mouth I used “probably” so maybe read it again before trying to make a point. There is no irony in what I said. Playing against someone who is high ranked would make you better and it’s true no one cares about rank but you have to be good to get that rank but that does not mean he then cares about that rank. The fact you are too ignorant to understand that is a big oof on your part and calling me out on that is an even bigger oof , you big oof. I never said they shouldn’t go up against an equivalent ranked killer I was arguing your idiotic point that stated that if I was to be a rank 4 I could not queue in a match with my rank 18 friends because I was too high rank. This would also make more people derank but your feeble puny mind can’t comprehend this because a no mither rank 18 escaped a doctor. You should really think about your arguments rather than mouthing them out half heartedly which is very clear due to your lack of understanding at the topic at hand. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt as it also clear at how upset you are which also lead me to use the “probability “ that the high ranking player humiliated you also your reaction to this point slightly proved it. I would close this thread before you get more abuse from other players and before you make yourself look even more ridiculous as it’s doing you no favors.
---
Survivor using cheap perks: "Lol get wrecked baby killer!! GG EZ!!"
---
Killer puts literally any perk on, "OMG of course you're running that!! GG baby killer!! Trash perks! Trash perks!!"
---
Honestly, I wouldn't be too upset if spotting him made him lose some stalk juice on him. You could still 99, but a survivor spotting you would give them even just a quarter second of reaction for later.
---
Try a higher sensitivity? But with enough practice it is doable
---
this creature from scp Universe and its a monster that lives in a app that stalks and kills people

But tbh I had this discussion like 6 times. I won't argue that much further.\^\^
---
Trapper is my main sad groups dont always do this. But when you get a group where they do that. You can definitely tell and its so frustrating you dont even want to play trapper.
---
Would be more engaging but I really don't think being on the hook should be "more engaging" imo. No fun to die on hook through no fault of your own. Died countless times because I accidentally clicked off screen or my keyboard stopped responding for a few seconds.
---
 I think he meant the third perk slot, or he say the comment about the flashlight and wanted you to equip one
---
I try to do this as killer. But when I pick up the survivor and carry them to the hatch, they dc most of the time. I just wanted to help.
---
Anything goes through CPU, not just physics. 
---
And I based my response on my experience. I do have a decent PC, but the game ran smooth on an Intel Graphics card.

His whole outfit begins looking like the area around him and he has no terror radius

He could have 99% exposed you and just popped it when you were at the pallet.
---
*why thank you love*
---
Every game its seems :\
---
I would LOVE to go against a good Nurse on PS4. Everytime I hear a Nurse blink, I pray I'll get to experience the pain.
---
Yes, it bugs me more than it does you, but can't edit title &lt;.&lt;
---
Generally huntress and jake are paired because they're both survivalists that grew up in the woods.
---
I've personally had more toxic survivors since there's most opportunities to show a survivor is just trying to be mean, while a killer depends on if they face camp or tunnel. 
---
Killer builds and stuff and having fun with them is the point of them being there in the game as annoying as it might be for some builds, but most.od the time the killer.just wants to have fun or try something out or use something they've never used before. Just putting aside any broken features survivors can be mean more often just from the feel of entitlement if they don't escape while all a killer can do is face camp or tunnel, but survivors have perks to aid in those situations.
---
Fungoose top tier.
---
Nice! I am almost finished my P1 with Claudette. (I use her for the perks I have, I was a Dwight main until I had all the perks, except for self care, so...)
---
&gt;OMG.. incentives won't eliminate them but most likely less people would do that
---
It won't eliminate camping because there is no real incentive. No real incentive to pip, no real incentive to get bp after you have all the perks on a single survivor or killer, no real incentive to not camp if im going to be honest. If i camp, i get to go against easier survivors next match by depipping and get 1 kil guarenteed against a team that can easily all escape if I didn't camp for example. 
---
&gt;Your naive approach is just to punish them right away. Then let's punish who camp hooks survivors side too. If they save someone before 15s has passed they get instadowned and can be moried.
---
Thing is, killer can do something about people unhooking eachother within seconds of getting hooked. The killer can pull the survivor who is rescuing off, down the person who is getting rescued. A survivor can't do anything against camping other than accept their death and hope their teammates get out. The killer has the power in both scenarios.
---
&gt;Your point is just to punish whoever don't play your way
---
It's not because it isn't my way of playing, it's because it's extremely unenjoyable and bad for the overall health of the community. I can guarentee that if every killer camped, match after match, many survivors would not  be playing survivor. It also helps spread toxicity and helps begin a nasty cycle (survivor gets camped, survivor bullies killers who are worse than them, bullied killer camps, repeat). If a legit strategy can be seen as trolling in some scenarios, should it really be a legit strategy?
---
&gt;Look this argument isn't new, it's the oldest thing brought up since the release of the game and certainly you're not the one who would stop it or give new ideas since I can't see any.
---
It isnt new. So If these discussions have riddled the game since launch why hasn't something effective been done about it? I'm not new. I know it's been a round for a while. But voicing opinions is a way to get change.
---
&gt;I won't even bother to reply, just look at the THOUSANDS of discussion about it and see yourself. Your topic was dead before was posted
---
Why even comment then?
---
nope thats wake up, spine chill applies to (or rather should only apply to)  Repair, Heal and Sabotage (speeds are increased by **2**/**4**/**6** %) whenever the killer is looking at the surv within 36m.
---
So he’s like a weaker Wraith? I’m not trying to be hateful, just curious
---
They said the reason was “brigading and vote manipulation”
---
Glen0ck asked where specifically they did the offense, and the mods not only didn’t answer, they told glen0ck he wasn’t getting unbanned.
---
It's a very stupid broken addon.  That being said it's rare enough on the webs where it doesn't trigger me.  Not like it is something they can run crazy often unless they stocked up for a while.
---
I don't want to watch streamers who derank (I know kitty does, not sure about the others).
---
first dbd meme that genuinely made me laugh
---
It's because the ranking system is so harsh on killers.

So instead of using "the ghost" the should just use "the ghost?" Is that right?
---
The only thing that needs to be adjusted beyond what they've already said they would is the two add-ons that give you like half a second stalk to expose someone while leaning. Especially combined with him being harder to break out of stealth than he should be, those two add-ons can be extremely oppressive
---

wow this post was made years ago lmao

Absolutely not. Boring af.

Instead of using the ghost face they should use the ghost or the scream

It’s not

Is he 8? Imagine getting that mad over a game. Grow the fuck up, dude. I wouldn't play with him anymore. No need to cater to someone who can't be pleased.

You can use any add-on every game if you dedicate yourself to spending points on only one character.

He’s like 10 or 11

---
My friend said ok
---
Cheers!
---
Her bear traps got nerfed so if they aren’t active they won’t kill a survivor at exit gates, which kills the pigs main role as an end game killer. Now you have too use her traps before the gens pop, so she’s pretty bad now since the bear traps are so easy too get off.
---
I'm not sure how people are still having trouble with flashlights. they're one of the strongest tools in the game for survivor, and one of the easiest to counter as a Killer. honestly, it puts a smile on my face when I see multiple flashlight equips in a survivor lobby because I know, as a killer, they will all scramble toward me as soon as their buddy goes down. suddenly, it's like Hex: Ruin 2. less people on generators, more people to swat away and keep tabs on.
---
Jesus Christ you are like a child. You can’t admit you are wrong.
---
Once again I never put words in your mouth you incompetent fool, keep proving my point by reacting like a little child to it more and more. You are thinking of it as a ranked game when in fact it’s just a glorified casual match. Most casual matches in games with a competitive game mode have “mmr” but don’t show it. It’s to keep games fair and fun. The fact that this game has uneven sides (one team has 4 people and the other has 1) it is impossible to even out the mmr especially with long lobby times.
---
Mmr can be decided in many ways
---
So maybe visually it looked unfair but mathematically according to their formulas that game could have been entirely fair. 
---
From now on play this game as a casual game mode. Do not look at ranks. Think of rainbow six siege, that game has casual game mode with mmr in it, yet you could be a gold player(average rank) and still play against diamond players (top tier), as it’s casual, they try to balance the teams out but to make the most efficient queue time they will fill in people.
---
So quit your whining as much as you would like to think it, but this is not a ranked mode. It’s just a glorified casual mode. 
---
Enjoy your day as your stubbornness and idiosyncrasies have affected my day.

Go into your next game, take a break from playing. It won’t change it never will, stop caring and you will enjoy it more.

Im rank 16 and just dealt with a rank 9.

Granted i was a rank 7 killer but i don’t see why this keeps happening. There should be plenty killers around until you hit red rank.
---
Honestly if the devs just looked at overwatch’s ranking system they’d be fine. (For those who don’t play overwatch, basically you have to be at a skill rank close to your friends in order to play competitively.)
---
Love Panda and understand why many love Noob3 (amazing voice) but it seems to me that he trashtalks DBD all the time. If he doesn't love it, maybe play something else?
---
Do you want survivors to do nothing to make the game longer?
---
Clown has over 30 bugs at the moment and he slows down after throwing a bottle which also slows down the survivor, so that pretty much negate  his power at the moment. He can be very easily countered if you camp or drop the pallet earlier and he can't counter safe loops or buildings with his power ( not with medium vaults being a thing ). He is also very weak against gen rush because he doesn't have mobility, stall or snow ball.
---
Wraith has stealth and mobility, plus some mind games with his cloak, but his placement is a little bit controversial, because he seems to not be very good without green/purple add-ons. But Clown also depends a lot on his add-ons, even more than Wraith I would say.
---
Spies from the shadows. Enduring. Haunted Ground (just because they always assume it's Ruin at the beginning). The last perk depends on what I feel like running.
---
Idk if I should be happy or creeped out
---
Puppers, Fungoose, and Ohmwrecker
---
I think he has to be the best DBD player in the world.
---
I have had very few issues with ghost face. His stalk works mostly as intended but sometimes it won't stalk someone in plain sight, and other times it will flicker the stalk. Another is that sometimes I will be pulled out of stealth when I have a fat ass rock between me and the survivor. Aside from that he's pretty solid. He makes for some funny moments cuz survivors rely soooo much on the red stain its insane. I just turn to hide the stain with normal killers but with ghost face its just all about positioning and survivors get so nervous when they are looping him. I cant count the amount of survivors that run straight to me while looking behind them assuming I'm still at the loop or when I cut them off at or heading towards one.
---
Thems some pretty good perks for your second game as huntress.
---
Oh my bad, for some reason I read wake up instead of spine chill 🤷‍♂️
---
Spine Chill
---
you might call it "not very useful" but it's still A tier and helps you against many killers
---
Watch streamers do it.  That's how I learned.  Noob3 and Monto basically taught me how to loop.  It's hard to describe you kind of need a visual.  And it had to be learned for various types of loops.  Looping a pallet is different than looping a jungle gym which is a little different than looping a t wall which is different than looping a building.  They all need to be practiced.  All about rotating that camera, reacting in time and infusing mindgames into the loops.  Hell even the killer effects how you run them.  A Huntress is looped completely differently than a Billy for instance.
---

It’s not a serious ranked game mode, it’s ranked for people who enjoy seeing their progress but they also don’t want to hinder anyone’s capability to play with friends after all this game has been modeled in this way.

He’s a troll
---
You skirted around the whole point of my previous post.  I'll let you read it again.  Then please respond to my actual point that it has a hard counter that skilled survivors can easily take advantage of.  You just dont personally like it but if someone else decides to run it it really isn't any sort of reflection on their skill.  There are many variables in which someone might run NOED.  How about the gatekeeper build for example? Is someone who likes that style of play not skilled because they ran NOED as part of that build??
---
Gen tapping can work tho. 
---
But Prayer Beads should be nerfed, it just rewards bad Spirits players, same with more blinks add-ons rewarding bad Nurses players.
---
Scp-106 fits better honestly
---
That's quite a good list &lt;3
---

I watch small streamers more but when I watch big streamers I watch Kittychipz and Noob3
---
bubba should be lower
---
Wake up is useless because there are already better perks. Wake up is useless unless in end game
---
Billy has been my main since I got the game but I've been really enjoying ghostface...
---
... So uh sorry about that
---
If ghostface sees myers before myers sees ghostface, ghostface wins. If it's a 1v1 in an arena without cover, myers wins. When they know each others location and can utilise cover, it's anyone's game
---
I mean I got 2k+ hours in and eventually I run out of pink and purples if I were to use them every game.  Then again I diversify my bloodpoint spending between lots of different characters on both sides.
---
SWF prefer killers they can gen rush while teabagging.  Doctor slows the game down waaaaay too much for an SWF group.  They just want to teabag Trappers.
---
Talk about blue balls goddamn!
---
Sorry :(
---
Yep but I'm a killer main and I really enjoy Ghostface so I don't think I'll ditch him any time soon sucks for survivors though because all they're gonna get is Nurse,Hillbilly and Spirit
---
I do perfectly fine at ranks 6-7 playing The Pig.
---
I don’t think the game is catered to survivors especially since they’ve been receiving nerf after nerf to balance the game
---
Never said I don't like Space Coconut. It's just that he was like "SpAcE cOcOnUt SaId ThAts HOW HAgs sHouLD PlAy" Seeing the how to deal with flashlights video he didn't tunnel as hard as the hag I was playing against. The survivors unhooked near him so he took advantage of that and went for the Nea. The Hag I was playing against did it wether or not she was unhooked nearby. Other people might think that it means Space Coconut tunnels flashlights that hard and might complain about that youtuber to his friends.
---
Ya, when the update I thought I saw an increase of Quentins but now I know why.
---
I know but I havnt had the time to upgrade people to get those perks.
---
I don’t see any marks of him being hit
---
I KNOW  
---
I LAUGHED AND NOW I HATE MYSELF
---
Challenge accepted
---
It’s shit
---
New survivor buff: bat, infinite uses and 0 cooldown, stuns killer for 5 seconds on use.
---
They can cause the match to snowball a whole lot faster which is why they arent fun to go against.
---
N - no
---
O - one
---
E - escapes
---
D - disconnection
---
The fact that you have to use one specific perk to counter one specific addon is the broken part. If it had any other inherent counterplay it would be fine.
---
Not really it only increases it by a very slight amount and it's not really noticable people only do it for the achievement or clothing.
---
Thanks for the insight, didn't knew they get less points (which makes me wonder why so many do it nonetheless)
---
He crushes someone in an increasingly shrinking invisible box
---
Because they're posted on the DBD forum, where they are supposed to be posted to enter?
---
It's hard to find DBD streamers that aren't ridiculously toxic or bias toward one side. I like Puppers but even he can get this way too. Generally I'd say OhTofu is the most genuinely easy-going fun streamer, and he actually plays both sides. I'll always be shocked that so many people love watching toxic asshats like Jendenise or Angrypug. Hell, they both derank themselves shamelessly as survivors just to shit on bad killers and act like they're gods. Heaven forbid a killer actually play well against either of them, because then they just get berated for some bullshit reason.
---
Quentins are a endangered mains and this new update makes them a whole target
---
Spine Chill counters many more things.
---
I'd argue you need Urban Evasion to counter a good hag.
---
Wake Up became semi usable (after this whole exploit business gets fixed of course) because of the addition of EGC.  Killer usually beats survivor to close hatch.  That 15% speed can be the difference of getting interrupted on the handle or not in that scenario.  I've ran it here and there because of that.  Obviously not since the bug became known though.  Only scumbags exploit.
---
Yea, Im a Freddy killer main too so it kinda sucks.
---
You obviously don’t main Claudette.
---
Thats dumb killers are meant to be stronger. It makes sense that with a whole perk it counters an addon.
---
1. wake up (applies to all actions, same goes for spine chill, but that only activates under certain circumstances and therefor cant be exploited that much)
---
2. Vigil - apparently reduces your cooldown by 30% instantly (havent tested this one)
---
3. Sprint Burst: you can save your sprint burst while running around to use it at will
---
Killers:
---
1. Play with your food: you get a stack even tho you downed the obsession
---
2. BBQ only shows until 3 stacks (you actually get 4 stacks, only visual)
---
3. Save the best for last: you dont loose the tokens
---
4. Furtive Chase: any survivor that unhooks becomes the obsession (only the surv that unhooks the obs should be the new obs)
---
5. Thana: applies to all speeds
---
6. Devour Hope: doesnt indicate that its active (havent tested this one)
---
7. Legion: double Blades infinite Mending + slower speeds
---
8. Doctor: if the doc shocks you in T3, you won't be able to do anything anymore (other than unhooking and throwing down pallets)
---
9. Plague: game crashes at end screen (not tested)  
---
At least thats the known issues that I've seen here on reddit...
---
There are plenty of people who do just fine with both characters in their current states. Everyone likes to bitch about hard hard Nurse is to learn, but then look what happens when you do? You’re a damned god. They purposely put balancing drawbacks on every power, and perk in the game. 
---
Not every Killer is meant to be meta or easy. Some just aren’t viable at certain levels and against certain situations. That’s reality. Work for your kills, adapt, learn, and move the hell on like the rest of us do. You don’t need everything made easy for you so you don’t have to bother trying ever. 
---

Darn can't wait for the new rework

#Killer mains complaints incoming
---
&gt;His strongest ability is to instill fear and paranoia
---
Which is a pretty useless ability past rank 15 but ok sure 
---
&gt;He requires focus, pressure, patience, and multitasking skills
---
This is literally ever fucking killer 
---
&gt;There was zero counter play with him before, that’s why he was changed
---
I never said pre nerf legion was fine 
---
&gt;The changes are balanced. Get over it.
---
They sure are balanced dosent excuse the fact that he is now shit tier 
---
&gt;Oh and PS, using Ruin and tunneling and camping with Freddy
---
This about legion i think you have the wrong post but i'll bite literally no competent killer does this so i dont know what you're getting at
---
&gt;learned to apply proper pressure
---
Freddy literally cannot do this because he has no map control and has to force people into his ability
---
&gt;People like to say characters like Freddy and Legion have powers that basically encourage tunneling but what about Spirit?
---
Because they literally do freddy cannot be played effectively unless he targets a single person legion has his best downing potential if you use frenzy to hit once catch up and down spirit has a shit ton of mobility  stealth and the ability to mind game get the fuck out of here with this bullshit
---
I only run it in my endgame build no other time.
---
I realize that, but you’re making a bad point with it
---
I literally play against one or two nurses in a six to eight hour session... I love getting owned by amazing nurses.
---
Thank you &lt;3 I suggest vigil for faster exhaustion recovery or pharmacy if you want to heal
---
Uh yeah, sure. Honestly don't care about your post anymore. Im playing with Marble now.
---
That was my risky clic of the day
---
But his lack of motive just makes him predictable and a killing machine. What about someone who knows what they’re doing is wrong and actually takes pleasure in causing pain? Micheal just stabs and breaths
---
Claudettea Prestige clothing got nerfed I believe
---
"They dont need to fix thess immediately because killers loved it when double blades existed!!!!" - Those people.
---
Your complete lack of understanding at the model of system is affecting me. It was made for casual game play, hence the no rewards being high ranked. They want people to play with friends my whole arguement is based around your under thought out plan that you wanted to implement. It would affect the game in a huge way and I have stated this on numerous occasions and you have never acknowledged this fact yet in other comments you have ignored my other points due to this being your only argument of value ( according to you) I’m done arguing with you as I have proven my points, yes all of them. If you feel unfulfilled then that’s your fault. Maybe re-read the comments to see where you went wrong. Get some sleep and play for a bit longer as rank 15 ( for someone who cares about their rank) is laughable when they are trying to implement ideas into a game.
---
Yeah how come no one talks about The Entity’s large bank account. Hunters break a lot of pallets that has to be pretty expensive to replace.
---
Unnecessary slug is the only form of being toxic that you listed imo. With how easy it is for survivors to unhook people and the fact that survivors also camp hooked people too which is literally the reason killer often camp hooks is to counter the survivor camp, and frankly "tunneling" is pretty much what killers do... I mean we chase you and put you down and then put you on a hook.... I have never understood the "tunneling" complaint. Especially with how many excellent methods of escape and out manuver survivors have. Yeah theres 4 survivors in a room but why are most of them toxic gamers? Why does survivor attract predominantly toxic gamers or so easily promote toxic behavior? Why has this been a major issue with this game for years and yet nothing is ever done about it? I'll give you slugging but even slugging is it's own tourcher for the killer. See the only real way a killer can intentionally be toxic and evil is to slug which takes time out of there next match essentially just to prove a point. Even so slugging is pretty countable anyways since most of the time even when I use the slug method just to chase a nearby survivor, they can still pick themselves up off the ground.
---
I use pharmacy already but Ill try vigil
---
The perk distortion.
---
Hiding in a locker.
---
Crouching behind a generator.
---
Getting within 40 meters of the hook.
---
Running one way for 4 seconds, and then doubling back.
---
Have you ever looked at twitch streamers who main a particular killer? Take Umbra for example who is a Huntress main. She has hundreds upon hundreds of all of Huntress' addons. I am sure there is a Spirit equivalent out there who could spend years tormenting people with their insane supply of prayer beads. 
---
Basically what I am saying is if you find a killer you're comfortable with and put time into them you'll have plenty of their addons, and with the recent bloodhunt that got extended I am sure there are people who achieved that.
---
Yea now you are. When i sent it you two were still arguing not talking about shoving quarters up asses. But i mean, honestly it's better than that us vs them shit so you two keep it up.
---
I’m sure that was just an Amanda reference, but funnily enough, some people in the leather/fetish community also oink 👀👀
---
I had to tunnel someone as ghostface so I can Mori them and screen shot it for a background. But 2 dc'd and one didn't get saved off hook.
---
Protect the dweet
---
Honestly, if you have bbq I’d replace either enduring or spirit fury with it. Sure it gives more bloodpoints but to see where the survivors are when you hook someone is really good
---
Freddy is more evil, he raped kids! Micheal may be the embodiment of evil, the pig makes people mutilate themselves, and ghostface may kill people but i’ve never heard of them taking away children’s innocence
---
Her -oh god, why am I typing this..- darkness in general got nerfed. Clothes, some of her hair got nerfed, etc., but it’s still pretty camo.

He was grabbed from hiding in her heart
---
This bug came from the same game that managed to create flying dwight heads with chainsaws while the devs were taking a vacation. I have the feeling it always has and will be messed up
---
But you can also see the traps on the ground and avoid them. Or find a flashlight and remove them that way. Or know she isnt in a certian distance to teleport. Or use deadhard to avoid the hit. Or pop all her traps while shes in a chase with somebody else or hooking someone. With prayer beads there is not a single way of knowing where the spirit is without spine chill. Its the fact that there is absolutely no other counterplay at all that makes it broken.
---
Yeah I understand that but would never do that myself.    I'd be bored to tears playing the same killer endlessly.  I got a rotation of about 8 different ones I mix it up with so my bloodpoints are pretty well spread out.  That's a pretty uncommon occurrence though.  Very few players put that amount of bps into a single character
---
Because if you don't directly show them that you're giving them to hatch... You run the risk of them shit talking you in the post-game chat like they legitimately escaped you. Can't tell you how many times I've been called bad or a dumbass by the Survivor that I spare if they wiggle free. It's supposed to be you giving them Mercy. Not giving them Pride. Escaping through the hatch as the last alive is a defeat. It's your team failing to do their job and losing. You shouldn't have pride for getting the hatch you should be ashamed
---
Swap out Tremors for Brutal Strength, and you're golden

---
How is camping, tunneling and slugging toxic exactly. Only face camping I can agree on since it fuck you over more than helps but slugging and tunneling is great
---
Spine chill is good for stealth killers in general
---
Lewding? Sounds like you’re PRUDE-ing. 8D
---
It's annoying when people are making posts about it. Not the game, not a killer, a user who said oink. Like what.
---
IF YOU RUN RUIN, THANAT &amp; DYING LIGHT ON THREE-BLINK NURSE, AND TUNNEL OFF HOOK, I DON'T LIKE YOU.
---
Those sound effects show you are another ochido wannabe

I do it all the time at ranks as high as 5 (when I actually TRY) with Freddy. I used him as an example and he was also brought up. I’ve found a viable way to play him, it took a while, and yeah against a really good group is survivors it might not always work. But it works for me literally like 95% of the time. Freddy is the king of mind games. Instilling fear and paranoia IS possible and helpful. Think about it. When asleep and/or injured what’s the first thing most people do against a Freddy? Heal and Wake Up at all costs. That’s one person that’s not looping you, not cleaning totems, not opening gates, and not doing Gens. Have a person you’re also chasing and that’s two people. A person on hook and that’s three out of four that is distracted. That’s ideal! They are so busy doing all that stuff that you now have all the time in the world to set up and take them down. You might not need to chase them right then, I play Remember Me, so the only survivor I even kind of tunnel is my obsession, and it’s just for my stacks. I don’t actually kill them right away, I use them to buy time. And when I no longer need them I dispose of them. The point with Freddy is to buy and waste time. Extend chases, make everyone afraid to do anything but run and hide. Make them not trust each other. Drive them away from Gens. Yes that’s what you do with all Killers but with Freddy there’s more to it. It takes so much damn multitasking and map awareness it’s insane. But in the end when you see that 4K, and even get “gg’s” at the end and see you got double the points most get with him? It’s fucking WORTH that work. Freddy is CHALLENGING. That’s why I like him. Legion is more challenging now as well, hence my willingness to play them more often now.
---
Also agreeing that Legion is balanced and then saying you still don’t like it because “he’s shit tier,” is hilarious. He’s BALANCED. He’s not meant to be a god damn god that instantly steam rolls. If he’s so shit, play him for fun or play someone else. There’s plenty of Meta Killers to choose from. Pick one of them! 
---
God god this subreddit is just amazing with its logic!
---
it bothers me a lot watching everyone 50 but Ghostface 37
---
Now that it’s unaffected by enduring and the stun time got buffed to 5 seconds its very powerful.
---
Their latest patch broke so much stuff on top of everything that was broken before. I'm not gonna commend them for promises of new content, if that content comes out and is awesome and bug free or close to then I will gladly say that they're nailing it but after this patch I can't.
---
People have done comparisons of the loot drops, theres no noticeable difference. Hell sometimes people were getting better items non-prestiged than prestige 3. I p3’d one survivor just for the achievement and I’ve never noticed a difference.
---
I wont be prestiging anymore. Its not worth it.
---
I play survivor and killer equally, so i know that it is hard as hell to play killer without ruin. Not impossible but it’s kinda like trying to run yourself over with your own car
---
Would’ve been perfect playing as Leatherface.
---
Its a premtive thing, protesting the idea in itself
---
KYF to show them the ropes, and then tell them to not take it too seriously. They'll die. A lot. That is normal. They will learn quickly if they don't focus on the bad stuff, and you guys just have fun playing anyway.
---
There is quite the learning curve to DbD. It took me over a week to understand the skill check warning is a skill check warning, and does NOT mean that the Killer is approaching. Fucked up so many skill checks because I immediately ran when I heard that noise...
---
Have fun playing a game with your friends without high expectations of winning, that's it really. Enjoy the little things like a first successful loop, and don't be mad at the Killer for doing their job.
---
Also do make sure your settings are good though. I've had a few problems in the beginning that were solved as soon as I optimised the settings for DbD (e.g. skill checks st low frame rates).
---
Only 1 leader or 1 prove thyself can proc at once
---
Mouse 1 or R2 for console to hit someone. Basically saying he has nothing unique besides the M1
---
I tend to avoid those but I might tunnel that person if he's being extra annoying.Like last day a nea crawled under a rock and prevented me from picking her up.When I found her again I facecamped her for abusing a bug(I'm pretty sure she knew the bug existed because she literally crawled to that exact position while I was kicking gens and destroying pallets)
---
He was banned
---
Just no! Like seriously why?? This will never happen!
---
SCP 999 pls

What are your favorite things about Billy?

I love Hag but I really enjoy teying out different things.  As of now though I suck at everyone else.

In that case, us Ace Mains are perfectly innocent!

What's the p for sale?-
---
Well, if you wipe your fucking axe on your forearm every time.... *shudders* infection.... so much potential for infection.... GOOD THING THEY'RE ALL ALREADY DEAD &gt;:D
---
Leatherface is massive and powerful meaning Ash would have little opportunities to attack LF's skull. Additionaly, TCM movies show that LF is highly durable and can withstand gunshot wounds and trauma which makes him quite deadly vs ash
---
Survivors: All I go against are Nurse and Billy! Play some real killers!
---
Also survivors: BROKEN KILLER WTF BHVR NERRRRF!

I learned from seeing noob3 being a toxic shit

Youtubers aside learn how to read a killer.

Hex: Ruin 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
Now. Go. Learn how to make music and give us oink version of the doom doot.
---
you can also notice grass moving when she is coming for you. gen tapping is a counter to it as prayer beads tend to be used on spirit builds that want to pull you off of gens and totems instead of dedicating time to chases.
---
Yeah this is so weird to me, hardest time I've ever had finding a game as killer *or* survivor even though it's the games anniversary event
---
Aww, a baby meg. They’re always so cute
---
I used to run both on my Adam when I was short on perks. I usually used the med-kit to fill the progress bar halfway and then self-care the rest, resulting in me only taking 20 something seconds to fully heal instead of the typical 32.
---
I agree. Though I hate how the word "toxic" seems to have different meanings to everyone.
---
To everyone else in your group you're a rando.  And you're saying randos dont cleanse.  But you cleanse.  Do you think you're the only solo queuer that cleanses?  I solo queue and I cleanse.  Do you see how your logic doesn't hold up?
---
&gt;:( i’ll have you know 5 years old is NOT a baby
---
Brutal strength on ghostface?
---
I totally agree with you. When I play him the survivors just go in front of me and look at me.
---
Killed by hand.
---
Can confirm.
---
You know exactly what he was expecting ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Always is the right time. Well almost always. I suggest using her without any add ons until you get the muscle memory of her blinks.
---
For remember me/wakeup, on the survivor side the obsession could just avoid getting hit, or someone could loop the killer for longer while the door is being opened. In the killer side you could focus on finding the obsession and patrol the door better. There are ways to get around the perk on both sides without directly using the perk. Same with all the other ones you mention.
---
But with prayer beads, if you do not have spine chill, it is a free hit for the spirit. There is no other counterplay. And a hit is much worse than being found, like with the two noise perks you just mentioned. If your found you can still loop and avoid a hit.
---
it bugs me that he refers to everyone as a he. 
---
seriously just refer to meg as a she!
---
[I do](https://imgur.com/gallery/bmgm9Wu)
---
During release and for a while after dbd had a massive shortage of killers on xbox because survivors would report them for everything in collaborated groups and they would get banned lol.
---
If you're running Enduring and Spirit Fury, yeah.
---
Those three perks together are meta on any M1 killer
---
Do you need a quarter?
---
Thicc jane
---
There was one game I played in which all the survivors took down all the hooks together and no one did any gens. So when I downed one, I stayed with him until the hooks respawned. Then I didn’t camp him after he was on the hook. But man was that game frustrating.
---
Solid build, but I run monitor instead of tremors, I find that radius outside of chase is more important.  Personal preference though.
---
He does that? I never noticed lol.
---
They intended for it to be uncomfortable, if I remember correctly. I changed my keybind to F to make it easier but I know some people use the scrollwheel down/up.
---
Why does jake look like a more feminine Roy mustang
---
Hey man are you okay
---
Low ranks are way more difficult than high ranks because of how often you get screwed by teammates who do not know what they are doing. A hell at 15-11, enjoyable at 10-6 and a hell at 5-1.
---
Nah, having a faint idea where that quarter last was...i think you can keep it
---
once you notice you will never not be able to not notice again
---
Of only I was talented in something useful instead of shitposting
---
Ah well. Back to the oinking &gt; &lt;
---
Damn
---
I consider myself a killer main even though it's 60/40 in favor of survivor for play time.  I don't really take offense to all the teabagging,  I've seen it since day one.  It really doesnt bother me.
---
Still, I could see it if people were messaging me on xbox saying terrible things.  PC users have the built in opportunity to be toxic.
---
Oh so saying his main attack is just the best way to use him
---
Sorry for late response was at the beach all day
---
Change it to a skillcheck where if you miss then your bar goes down faster and if you hit a great it stops the progress for a second (but then there has to be x seconds before the next one so you do eventually die)
---
Plague is queen because I'm 99% certain she's cursing them out in ancient Babylonian and I love it.
---
That's so hot.
---
its funny cause its true
---
honestly i dont find ghost face all that powerful yet every game ive played with him at least 2 people disconnect once they realize they are up against a ghost face
---
Agree, downing a survivor quickly however is not always possible. If you have 4 decent survivors in your lobby then downing one quickly isn't exactly an easy task. Leaving a strong tile that a survivor loops is also something a lot of killers don't know about, but they should remove these insane loops like the Ironworks of misery window, god bus on autohaven wreckers etc. These loops have no "skill" to them and you aren't getting outplayed if a survivor goes there(it's like if a killer ran ebony or something, you aren't out playing survivors by running that) . Strong loops like the shack are amazing, because it actually requires skill to loop, and the killer can do something about it if they are smart
---
Welp, looks like we gotta reset blood lodge
---
We can all rejoice at this.
---
Here’s some evidence to back up that Jen can be toxic: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vtQKDj-yYB4
---
She and Pug are also somehow Fog Whisperers. No matter what they do, the worst that’ll happen to them seems to just be a warning.
---
I found it.
---
I just bound my hook struggle to mouse wheel down.  Unlock my scroll wheel and let it spin!
---
Death by snu snu
---
I would much rather a nerf to his power and then actually make him stealthy and sneaky. When I get exposed and it’s panic like wtf!? Where is he!? I’m thrilled. When we are running out in the open and all of a sudden I’m exposed, hate it.
---
Good call.
---
Still me at rank 11 haha
---
How come I played against the more powerful killers and not able to find pallets or stop them striking me? I also ran to the killer when he chased someone else and kept using the flashlight like a dumbass, what's the outside ward map and the yard?
---
I did manage to find chests which I'm proud of and unhooking others
---
Over 30? That’s a lot. Do you have a list of them.

Mmmm... The delectable salt here alreadyis delicious
---
I have one of those scroll wheels that can unlock and spin freely.  I just set it to "down" and let it spin!
---
Well, omegablink nurse is another issue in its entirety, i agree, lol. I was just focused on spirit and prayer beads when I made this post. Also, I had heard rumors (that i don't know for sure are true) that they were gonna address nurse's blink addons in a future patch.
---
Sounds like someone's telling porkies.
---
Shit posting is useful. Karma is a currency in guild wars 2 ;)
---
I think nurses is hella strong on ghostface because he can turn off his tr, puts a lot of pressure on survivors
---
So do the Ether VOL% addons for Clown.
---
Me, a Pig main, convincing Behaviour that poor Amanda doesn't need more nerfs.
---
Not really though lol it's way out of proportion on here
---
I will try this, thank you sir
---
Nobody seems to play him at red ranks. 
---
Or the ones who play him, spam with purple/red add-ons and NOED. 
---
And from what I saw, Doctors get looped so hard, they need blood lust to catch up the surivor.
---
Top tier killer btw.
---
Sounds awful. First off they would be splitting the playerbase, which sucks for queue times. Secondly this just isn't a "competitive" type of game, even if you disable some perks.
---
I mained doctor and everyone is welcome in the Daddy Carter Shocky Cyrclejerk, but if that addon is the exhaust one, you are banned from the club
---
So then yeah the killer got outplayed as they failed to apply to pressure to all survivors. However it does require the rest of the team to be working on objective during this time. What you're saying is there is no skill in holding m1... Which is true, but the team still outplayed. Nea can run all she wants but if no one is doing gens it's pointless.
---
Don't you know?  To join the DbD elite you have had to see every licensed movie and read all the lore or you have no right to play anything.  /s
---
I've actually been running Wake Up a lot since EGC hit. Doors are always so close together that it's the only chance you have of escaping once killer closes hatch. I've hated not being able to use it out of fear that I'll end up punished for it.
---
How do you get them to it? I had a guy I downed at the exit gate, wanted to carry him to the hatch but he kept wiggling and running back to the exit even as I walked past like 4 hooks. Just “nope.”
---
Well the exposed one can't dead hard
---
Nurse and doctor doctor shocks and nurse ruins lives
---
By that same token, winning one chase and having 3 gens pop is also boring. So here we are at an impasse again.
---
It’s hilarious seeing this. I’d much rather see personal achievements or discussions about the game rather than extremely unfunny memes that this entire sub is over saturated with. This sub might as well be called dbdmemes honestly, it’s garbage
---
Bro I take out 3 dulls minimum every game.  Sometimes 4.  Still eat that NOED.  The others don't cleanse.  It is well documented how absurdly easy it is to proc noed against 4 randoms.  I am a very good player so I know to take everyone I can find out.  My teamates almost exclusively ignore all dulls on map.  Stop trying to spin this like randos cleanse dulls routinely you know damn well that they don't
---
Flashlights are not toxic
---
A defensive stance is the best chance Ash has. Preferably in a rotating motion. (Standing in one place, but rotating 360 degrees slowly.) The reason I say a defensive maneuver is the best chance Ash has is because he can't outrun or ambush The Spirit. However, at best these defensive measures are guesswork because The Spirit is invisible while phase-walking. The Spirit is also extremely fast while phase-walking, meaning she can outmaneuver and ambush Ash easily. At best, Ash is a sitting duck.
---
Just take practice man, definitely way more than a few hours to understand loops and such. I didn't see an improvement in my own play untill about 600 hours, and I'm at almost 2k hours now. Stick with it.
---
It only works if the killer is a tunneler, it’s not good
---
I mean calm spirit aginst doctor so really you are wrong and are just salty to be pulled off gens
---
free my man, he did nothing wrong
---
I haven't used the exhaust add-ons yet, though. D:
---
And doesn't bleed or make injured sounds.
---
Do you sleep?
---
Absolutely agree. A friend who I play with a lot has brought up a mechanic they apparently have (had? never played it) in DOTA 2, where people who have received enough negative feedback get out into a 'toxic queue' with other people sharing their, let's call it playstyle.
---
Probably not a perfect model, but I would love to see some kind of behavioural feedback system ingame. They really need to work on the toxicity in the community, and not encourage it even more. Players who just want to have fun playing the game either end up leaving or turn bitter. It's sad.
---
This is also another problem I hadn't though of.
---
Ghostface is way too high
---
hun, your game, your money, play however you like
---
until Death By Snoo Snoo
---
Oh, thanks... Then you are welcome to worship Carter's big punishment stick
---
Like a boss, too. Didn’t even sprint!
---
Thana is basically having no effect at all from what I’ve been told. Legion blades lower all action speeds which is why I’m currently stockpiling them rather than using them, Play With Your Food level 3 gives a stack back when you down your obsession (I only have PWYF 1 on Myers and can confirm it does not give back any tokens, that’s why I’m still using it)
---
Well when I first got the game I just got him because his power sounded cool, that's still the reason I play him mostly.
---
He has really good map pressure if you can reliably rush around the map with chainsaw and he can trivialize pallets for the most part.
---
He's just a simple to pick up killer with a high skill cap and I enjoy him a lot
---
The corn people though man, I suffer from corn blindness
---
If so you literally have 1 survivor not doing gens. Focus on the others and you'll be fine.
---
I dont need any of those. I've seen plenty of them in red ranks? What are you talking about?
---
The suit/vest outfits, though. ❤️
---
It's not a free hit because you as spirit have to be good at tracking because you don't see people in the phase I've ran prayer beads many times and have been out smarted so there are counters and if you are aware she is phasing don't stay in one place
---
Please provide said documentation.  No but seriously this anecdotal argument is boring me.  Peace brother and may your games be less NOEDy
---
If another player in the same game felt the same lag at about the same time, then yes, it was the killer's fault. Can't really call out a definite lag switch as they may just be playing from their local McDonald's, but yeah.

When i used to main doc i'd always use add ons that would make his terror radius the whole map
---
Nah, I try my damnedest to meme in the game and have fun. Until the flashlights and teabags come out, then it’s ass blasting time.
---
If you got to brickys yt theres an entire 20 min video on different builds for him. Its a year old but it could be good to start off on
---
That explains why I wouldn't find any info on him- But wasn't the mask that he's using inspired by the scream paintings?
---
Yeah but think about it your getting mad about an add-on that has been in for over half a year there is nothing wrong because one you should always assume she is phasing if having prayer beads because she will always have a movement add on on. Two when she is phasing unless she is phasing for a chase just walk don't run around leaving marks everywhere or run lightweight (another perk to counter her ) or poised or dance with me spine Hill isn't the only counter perk it's just the only one to know she is looking at you
---
By work, you mean hope the protection event actually gives you a stack of anything like its supposed too. Protection hits are literally broken. Its impossible to get more than one protection hit stack on WGLF so theres not a shred of doubt in my mind MoM is literally a dead perk thats impossible to activate under any circumstance.
---
Couple games ago i took a couple hits for my friend that was being tunneled. And by a couple hits i mean i healing/getting healed and taking more hits. I got exactly one protection stack from all that even though the protection scoring event popped up and gave me 100 points and my friend would have went down if i hadn't jumped in front of the killer for them. 
---
And alternatively, ill get protection scoring events even though the other three survivors are across the map doing a gens no where even near the killers terror radius.
---
Moral of the story is protection hits are literally broken and bugged and do not work properly. Meaning MoM is a broken perk in the sense that is literally will never work the way its intended to.
---
The other day I dropped the last guy and left him on the ground as I went to find the hatch. When I went back, I turned back and forth, like, telling him don't wiggle, I got you. I picked him up, and he seemed to understand. I walked him all the way across the map to the hatch and dropped him right next to it without him wiggling at all. It was cool.
---
Then I slammed the hatch shut in his face and picked him up and hooked him, but I'm just an asshole, so...
---
Possibly, but the mask is generally from $2 shops.
---
I’m gonna at least P3 my David for the pants and head to go with my shirtless cosmetic. Gotta be that tough guy.
---
Not anymore, for ps4 at least. I get nurses ranging from decent to godlike pretty regularly now since the framerate improved.
---
It's actually still good especially with endgame collapse because if you get unhooked and downed and he chases the rest out you still have Ds to get out stop making bs claims when you barely use it because it was needed when it is more balanced than what it used to be
---
I watch how people play and try to copy what they do, my thing says 20 bit what's the number 4 mean my level or rank?
---
Someone told me when I first played few months back i don't have to worry about harder killers and I ended up getting the trapper back then but got disappointed when i faced veterans
---
Also what are those baloons on the generators i thought like my dumbass that it was hinting at the IT clown.
---
I love it
---
Can you do it so it works with up and down, or just one way
---
again like I said I just got that all done on ghostface and he just came out, can't be that hard to do it for everyone
---
I had a guy report me for finding him while he was downed. A direct quote... "I dont know how all of you killers have special powers, but I bust my ass off trying to survive."
---
I’m one of those people who teabags as GhostFace if the survivor is toxic
---
Mine wasn't special because I don't care about prestige ii only recently did it since the event I've had the game since release
---
Lol ok kid
---
Did he ever find it?
---
The only time I hate it when I play killer is when they tbag or flashlight me from the gate.
---
wow what a fortnite gamer response
---
Tru3, Scott Jund, Ardetha and in my experience, everyone that isn't Bricky.
---
On steam forums I see also a lot of people calling Doctor underpowered.
---
But don't worry, devs said Doctor is a priority for them right, so he might get buffed in the future, probably after Freddy rework.
---
That’s for the anniversary event!  Your rank is in the little circle right corner. 20 is the lowest and 1 is the highest. Where it says level next to your character is that characters individual level, max is 50.
---
Ranks 11s unite
---
I've been saying this ever since they nerfed it to the ground. F that perk... I'm getting to the point that i refuse to play with people who run it. Like if you swf with me and you run selfcare I'm gonna call you out ask you why and tell you why it's a waste. If you continue to use it I'll replace you or boot you from the party we dont have time for that on my squad. 
---
I'll always heal ya... I'm a team player... I rather you run perks that are gonna benefit the whole team throw on some ds, small game, well make it, borrowed time in stead at least those are beneficial and dont take 32 seconds to use each time.
---
I wouldn't use it just to be safe, the devs haven't put out a statement but chances are they are monitoring it to see who is or isn't intentionally doing it, after a point they might make it bannable (Which they should). 
---
I don't know why the devs haven't implemented a system to just disable addons/perks, offerings can still exist in your inventory such as Red Envelopes from the lunar event, you're just not allowed to use them so i don't understand why they don't do the same for bugged perks and addons considering something always breaks
---
The one you get for buying the chapter without auric cells
---
Yeah I agree. Skill lies in ability to evade and win chases. No skill lies in holding m1. However knowing that you need to hold m1 and being aware of objective positioning, removing the three Gen strat etc. Knowing when to look for other survivors on the last Gen etc does require some skill and understanding. 
---
I'm saying if the killer committed to chasing the nea, and the team did the gens allowing gates to be powered and team to escape. Then yes indeed the "team" outplayed the killer. Nea was a huge part in that and it required skill, but the rest of the team made the actual escape possible. One cannot work without the other.
---
To address your last point I agree 100%.  But that isn't the outcome of NOED that feels cheap.  It's the fact that they use it to get whoever they last chased when the final gen pops down and hooked OR they simply get someone attempting to open up a handle.  The rest of what you said is good and fine but those people are fucked lol.  And that's the down that occurs like clockwork whenever they run it.  That first survivor is basically fucked.  You can't even really loop a noed gamer endgame since they have the haste on top of the instadown and a fair amount of pallets will have been used by this point regardless.
---
It's called SWF it literally just averages the rank also rank means nothing because there's no insentive it has nothing with skill it's just means you can do some basic stuff you should be able to do by rank 15
---
Yeah but there's better options. Item consumption is pretty meh and 9/10 times survivors will switch from first aid kit/toolbox to manual heal/repair when they see the icon. Granted it does slow them down since they're not using their item, but why use something like that compared to Franklin's or Clownphobia? 
---
I love the Doctor Worldwide build but clownphobia gives you 50% slower healing in your terror radius, which is much effective than double item consumption rate. You could even use infectious fright so other survivor locations in your massive terror radius are revealed when you down someone, although it might not be too helpful considering you're Doctor and your built in tracking, while not as good as Infectious Fright, is decent enough. 
---
You could also run Dying Light and just hope the obsession dies from hookings. Now you have a 3-gen and a 25% repair speed penalty with one survivor dead.
---
In case anyone was wondering, you do not have to mash spacebar very fast at all. 3-4 times a second is all you need.
---
It will come over time. I sucked at survivor at first but over time you learn certain tricks and pick up things and get better. It can take a while though but the more you practice the better you get. Like I said perks can really help.
---
You rely on teammates to save you from the hook, do gens, be chased, open doors.. guess that's not optimal either.
---
Looks like a cool skin concept for The Bee
---
Clearly, the averaging of the rank did not happen here.
---
Lol you had me with that first statement for a sec.  I don't know if this makes a difference maybe you're PC but I play on PS4 and on console NOED is a staple throughout the ranks.
---
I can't really run the perks because I don't own DLCs apart from spirit(killer only), legion (killer only) and plag (killer only)
---
You dont have to mash, only 3 to 4 times a second. You can rebind it to mousewheel though
---
I agree with disable claudette... I hate claudette players.
---
I also play both sides, and both sides complain a lot, I can comment about it. We don't have a cross hair, how are we supposed to crosshair accurately reveal a gf from medium to long range? Short answer, we cant consistently. The changes are needed and wont destroy the killer. The charge addons were stupid strong imo, and needed an adjustment, the killer can still spam his ability till he gets the expose off... hes still an m1 killer that consistently gets expose effects. Hes everything good about Myers without the bad... he'll be fine.
---
I personally liked the old way more. I constantly now get hatch escapes and it’s still 4 or 5 gens to go.. as a survivor I’d just repair a gen further from hatch and then exit gate so as to not have those standoffs.
---
