Because I think we're doing a pretty great job so far

---
I call them Closettes
---
I remember my first game as Clown. I bought him and was so proud and ready. I got him to 5 with bloodpoints I had, and I used 2 perks. One was the one where your terror radius is bigger but you get more bloodpoints. And the other was the Thrill of the Hunt. I killed 3 of the survs, and once I found the last one, I chased him until he died. What else would I do in that situation? Right? Theres nothing else to do. Well anyways after the game he claimed I tunneled him at the end. He said "Good job bud hold W and tunnel me at the end, youre pro!" I mean am I dumb? He's clearly in the wrong right? Lol
---
At least legion has a power
---
Meg. I bet she has taken some kickboxing classes at some point.
---
If you're gonna try that hard for the 4k then it is a risk you have to take. I consider a 3K with the only person escaping by hatch an absolute win on my part, no idea why so many people feel hurt by it.
---
Hellooo nurse~
---
Oh damn. I had seen another post on here that you could just block them and not be queued again with them.
---
As a killer main i gotta tell that i've tried all killers, but in purple rank already it's really difficult. Nurse has a really hard learning curve, you have to pkay her for a lot before you can win, and billy in a lot of maps is shit. Spirit is so viable and pretty strong compared to others. I loved to play trapper back in the days, but now if you're not otz everyone will demolish a trapper. Sorry surv mains, but until totem spawns will get fixed and some surv perks will be nerfed people will always use spirit
---
Great great work, thanks for sharing!
---
Can throw ace in the hole too...to get those sweet sweet addons
---
It’s not a NOED for survivors. And as people said, stop tunneling lmao.
---
I didn't downvote you. Also those are all top killers so yeah again ruin is needed as a boost for lower rank killers and people who need early game set ups like I said. Ruin might be too good for spirit and nurse when it's hard enough to watch for them while looking for a hex but on a bubba  it's totally manageable. I see it more as a problem of those killers and not the perk.
---
I think it will probably take like years to receive a chapter of resident evil due to the fact capcom is doing a halloween resident evil event with monster hunter world
---
for 1-6 your correct   
---
 Q1: each pile is unlimited but an idea for a 4th pile in the basement would be cool  
---
 Q2: franklins doesn't work and the killer can pull a survivor off a pile  
---
 Q3: ruin affects gears, not the gen, but the time could go up to 115% if you keep hitting good skill checks  
---
 Q4: yes they keep the gears when hooked/sacrificed, but moried/DCed survivors would drop them  
---
 Q5: yes toolboxes would speed up gears but there could be add-ons that could let you hold more (the gears will be appart of the toolbox and will drop if the toolbox is consumed)
---
Survivors definitely need to be looked at before they nerf more killers
---
Nurse is a nightmare to go against in indoor maps

Top tier DBD meme, thanks
---
If they hard nerf spirit i'm probably just gonna quir the game honestly, i don't get how adrenaline is a thing but everyone complains about spirit. You can literally have everyone down exceot for a guy that do a gen and everyone is up, speed boosted. Wtf
---
I DID THIS ON PS4 AS WELL. I ALSO HAD TO CHANGE IT SO PEOPLE COULDNT SEND ME FRIEND REQUESTS BECAUSE THEYD DO THAT JUST TO SEND BS SALTY MESSAGES. ITS REFRESHING TO KNOW THAT HATERS CANT SEND ME NONSENSE ANYMORE.
---
22nd
---
that's completely dependant on connection rn. dedicated servers can't come soon enough
---
Lithe is a good perk but windows are already good for looping by themselves while balanced landing opens up   
---
more potential for loops that aren't so great without it.
---
Thanks dude

np
---
My husband plays that if one (or more sometimes) of the survivors he’s playing against DCs then he tries to signal the ones left to point farm with him. If they catch on he hooks all of them twice and they heal each other up and then chase each other around a lot and they throw down all the pallets for him to break. That way they all get tons of points, he gets brutal killer and they don’t get skrewed over for being down a person or two.
---
I've had survivors who were horrendously laggy, and when i say they should fix their internet, they tell me mine is just bad cause im host. Like wtf do you not know there are dedicated servers?
---
I would like changeable moris I think that would be cool
---
I aspire to be this scary with Wraith. I use coxcombed Clapper and the "ghost" brown add-on/wall hack add-on and pounce on people. Unfortunately, I haven't received any feedback of survivors shitting themselves yet:/
---
Use the Katana/Katana Scabbard Add-Ons together. Holy shit it’s like the new Meta.
---
Once you exit phase, you just shoot out at like 500/mph. Makes it super easy if you fuck up, because you can just glide right over from like 10ft away, lunging and at the ready
---
i really hope you opened the hatch and then had someone else carry out the other key! Dedication to the cause.
---
This is awesome
---
I’VE PLAYED BOTH SIDES. IT JUST BRINGS ME NO JOY. USUALLY IT’S FOR A DAILY.
---
That’s some awesome fan art! Love the style!
---
Wait I saw this before, but it was flipped the user was apologizing to killers as a survivor main. Did you post both of these?
---
Are you one of those killers who will dc if I immediately find your ruin since it's such a P2W perk (which it isn't since you can get it for free)
---
I also wish Ruin wasn't necessary at high ranks. Perk diversity in my eyes is the best way to keep the game from going stale
---
Noed no skill my opinion
---
###bruh
---
I mean it's playing the game. It makes sense to go after someone who is injured. It can also be the Survivor who's the idiot. Saving someone when the Killer is camping. Plus, people can be working on generators if he is camping. Punish him.
---
what rank is it just wondering
---
So the killers are all Nurses and Spirits? I've heard something like that before.
---
And when you put on iron will you’ll never get a spirit again.
---
DAMN BRO!! I'M SORRY I HOPE YOU DONT GET TO MANY "ESCAPE WITH X" DAILIES! THOSE ARE BULLSHIT AND THEY ARE ALWAYS ON THE SURVIVORS WITH NEAR USELESS PERKS
---
Purple ranks
---
this is fine. if knock out will as you say. it will courage slugger will do more slug. this is already good enough
---
Perk: Surviver With A Fucking Gun
---
Iron will is so underrated. I always use it in my build at rank 1.
---
but why Demo?
---
From what I can see, killers are toxic when they start to lose and survivors are toxic when they start to win
---
Honestly the game would be a lot better if survivors had another objective to complete.  They can finish 5 gens waaaay too quickly.
---
Oh. So it does one-shot, just takes bit more.
---
Portals I'm guessing
---
Oblig "I'm scaroused" comment
---
Puts bell on survivors back after smacking them in the head and bing bong they're gone
---
Completely agree. Also, perks like pop, discordance, surveillance and the plague one are not free, you have to grind or pay in order to have decent perks, without them you can do little to nothing if ruin gets destroyed
---
Oh fyuck I didn't even see that lol
---
Gotta educate myself the L O R E
---
The other key was given to a Steve who led Nea to hatch as Bubba was revving the chainsaw. Bubba closed it as I run up and I just reopened it. We all had a good laugh with Bubba.
---
“I’ll take a staff job, double the money”
---
It is clearly anime inspired, from the design itself to the storylines to... everything. Just... look at their faces. 
---
I have nothing against RE by the way, I even enjoyed a couple of them.
---
I thought the same thing! The downvotes are trying to hide the truth! Take one friend. Preach the truth!
---
Agree. I honestly hate ruin, when i use it it gets deatroyed after two seconds, but if you don't use it you get gen rushed in 10 seconds. Thank god surveillance exist
---
Billy on Leary’s, of course he had a bad match lol
---
Am I missing something? It looks to me like he let you escape. If he wanted to kill you why didn't he hook you while he had you?
---
I want to believe in this... but it just won't happen I feel.
---
Oh killer I haven't broke past 6, I think
---
I mean this is kind of the OG scream plot
---
Yeah I know, I was just hoping for details. Maybe there were a lot of flashlight saves or Tbags. Idk
---
Halt your heresy
---
I thought this was going to end with
---
"So I can pick you up then"
---
followed by a D-Strike icon
---
rank 21 trapper
---
I think you meant to put rank 20 killer on the butterfly.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
The baby grew so fast!
---
Yeah but it doesnt look epic like this
---
WHY ALL THE REALESES OF DLC AND MIDCHAPTER HAVE TO BE A TUESDAY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE FUCKING FRIDAY? I GO TO THE UNIVERSITY THE FUCKING TUESDAY ALL THE FUCKING DAY
---
It's rough on both sides, rank reset is unfun
---
I've got a tip for that. I easily destroy anyone who pallet camps like that.
---
If you can learn the range of the lunges of the killers, you can easily lunge the pallet and hit or down them through it.
---
The angle you need to do it at will vary from pallet to pallet, but with a bit of practice you'll easily be able to kill any pallet campers.
---
Also, if they just drop it then run, fake like you're gonna go into it, back up, then go around it (only works on smaller loops).
---
It's always about playing to your opponents. Don't just w after them, turn a bit to flank and force them to take different routes, try to cut them off, bait pallets, etc.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Look at endgame timer
---
convenient? that logically makes no sense, you would get more points playing something stronger, if you like the feeling of playing a weaker character and seeing them grow i get it, but you would be slowing your progress that way, and for sure it wouldn't be the convenient option.
---
What is DC
---
I think he was trying to rhyme
---
Anyone who sticks around to taunt the killer deserves whatever comes to them. Just take your win and go.
---
At this point i have transcended to the point of leaving hate comments in my own steam profile just to keep it going.
---
for me its just fun to play other characters for once, bc im always stuck on main. its like a new experience
---
Mike.
---
All he has to do is stare and block ubtil he gets evil within tier 3. Then it's insta down. Sorry trapper. =/
---
Ikr ;-; me too...
---
Well, his logic checks out. Doctor's core mechanic replaces his offensive options and speed, but only slows Survivors, and at best detects them. With addons like sniper, he branches out, but base Doctor is basically taking an inferior option if he's using Treatment outside of a few rare scenarios, such as perfectly preventing a pallet drop (which may only save the time he lost by being in Treatment mode) and hitting multiple Survivors (which is difficult with his base range).
---
The only real advantage is finding players, and high-level Killers don't benefit nearly as much from the help. Plus, it's not instant gratification after Madness 1.
---
its good. but why is it the mouth so watery lol. i think its fit if was teary hehe
---
When you get ran around so hard the survivors do 6 gens instead of 5.
---
Evidently, once you're at Madness 1, aside from the initial scream, you never give away your whereabouts. It's also a while before you reach 2, meaning that unless you're in Doctor's radius for a while or eat a few shocks, you're just as hidden as you would be against anyone else.
---
she didnt swallow
---
Are you sure that wasn't the last dull totem for NOED?
---
And S for Schoolboy
---
Dude tf?
---
Wait until around the end of the game to start using the bear traps once you have a few hooks in and they'll be distracted from the gens to try to get away from you and get the bear trap off.
---
It's almost never 0 reason. Nearby gen worked on with no scratchmarks? Check a locker. Maybe they saw a brief glimps of a survivor in the distance and went to check. Maybe they heard the stupidly loud grunt survivors makr when they slowly get in to a locker. Maybe they figure a survivor spawned there because it's far from killet spawn.
---
Really could be a huge number of reasons. Too man survivors think they're being stealthy when they're not at all.
---
Mine is about 50/50 praise and salt. I’ve honestly experienced more salt on siege
---
Could also make the same argument for Ruin on everyone but Nurse, Spirit, and Hillbilly
---
Why not both

A "Mori" is a killers special kill animation. By bringing special offerings called Moris, you can then kill a survivor if the requirements are met.
---
we just need to develop a culture of accepting casual players. we have to stop getting mad at teammates that run dumb perks and killers that "farm" just because we want the peak of competition out of one game.
---
Me doing a gen: "Y'all hear somethin?'" 
---
Nemesis spinning up the minigun:
---
Bubbandiris
---
I have no reason to lie about it lol
---
Some questions are best left unanswered.
---
Hard camping isn't fine, a good killer will wait to pull the other survivor off even if the survivor fakes the unhook a few times. Unless you're swf with friends with everyone blocked the person who is unhooking.
---
I only ask because the description doesn’t say basic attacks, it just says attacks.
---
Lucky you for not experiencing it still
---
*beefy thud*
---
*Micheal chuckles*
---
I'm on Xbox so it's not as bad but I still see a bunch of spirits. Nurse aren't as common on Xbox though.
---
Yeah that’s not how the perk works. It’s only activated when you have the door open. Try again!
---
Boil Over only increases your struggle effect, not your meter progress. Since you're in a SWF, you can probably replace Boil with BT, or make a lot of use of Aftercare.
---
I spent 3 hours to finish it so obviously it's a doodle lol
---
Cum
---
Mmmmm yeees
---
Oh nah I was on call with him, he didn't bring up trying to rhyme
---
That's great. One of my first ever killer matches, three survivors were hanging out teabagging until the absolute last second; but they didn't coordinate well and so they all bumped into each other in the scramble to escape and two of them done got Entity'd.
---
They filled up the post-game chat swearing at the survivor that escaped, and I'm here like "If you hadn't felt the need to spend several minutes making fun of the person who just picked up the game you would have survived".
---
Mmmn yeeeeeeeeees
---
What are the conditions under which DS activates again? Going after a survivor who just got unhooked right?
---
No, please tell me how being DSed as a killer is more annoying though
---
Just an idea, but maybe they could make moris interchangeable kinda like a cosmetic. So u can unlock new ones in the new season pass thingy. Sorta like how destiny 2 added new finishers that you can change.
---
And didn’t Bruce Campbell say he would love to do more voice lines for ash?
---
Spirit and Legion are surprisingly unfun to play against, Legion is weak but annoying, the match is boring basically
---
Spirit is unfair, since she is hard to predict, the only true way to counter her is being a chameleon Claudette with urban evasion I guess, newer survivors have no way to beat her lol, specially if she has ruin + haunted grounds
---
My point was not just about ruin, it was about ruin being used along with others too as a collective, making him a strong killer
---
HINJAKU HINJAKU
---
lmfao
---
I look forward to your next whiny baby survivor post
---
When you walk in youre parents room and there ducking
---
I hate liars. And entitled babies.
---
This is exactly right, every word of it
---
Yeah I’m surprised too! I laughed when I heard the audio cue for DISPLEASED. 
---
I’m assuming I didn’t put much pressure on them and the round had gone pretty quick; one of the ones I sacrificed had no mither on (and geez that “quieter grunts of pain” really doesn’t work) along with maybe not even hitting the obsession Nancy, I had less hits than I normally would get, so overall less points total.
---
You're so salty damn bro, you must be so fun to play with
---
What’s annoying is how easy it is to rank up in matches, I have gotten a pip up when my team got demolished and not a single gen has been done. It’s insane how easy it is to rank up as a survivor, so you eventually get funneled into spirit games.
---
Oh no other things AND Ruin? How did you survivor that nightmare
---
Ok but killers feel the same way when it comes to like Ruin, PGTW, and other gen slow perks.
---
Was this a brand new lvl 20 trapper or higher up?
---
Ruin and BBQ are miles above other perks. You must not play high rank survivor if you dont respect their impact on the game.
---
Nope...I literally played a match an hour (on ps4) ago and we were facing ghostface. He did the same thing to me. I was try to mind game him but that didnt happen. Lol. I didnt know you could do that
---
Excuse me?
---
Michael's theme doesn't get a few points?
---
I just ranked it on what it would be on a 32 Meter terror radius average killer, not taking powers in mind whatsoever.
---
He's African American. I know it's pretty hard to see under his mask in game. But you can just barely see under if you spin him around lol. 
---
IIRC, there is a video on youtube of them without their masks. Not sure if they were officially released or if someone just dug out the game files. If they'd even have game files without their masks.
---
Sounds like you've got a stick up your ass. No one's gonna lie about this, there's literally no gain. You're in such hard denial its funny
---
Yess
---
It’s just my opinion dude, but ruin can be cleansed. Doesn’t make it terrible though.
---
Left through the exit gates, as you do
---
I never used them until recently; man they are powerful together!
---
I think a lot of perks need some balancing because it makes both sides really unfun to play BUt SkIN aRe MoRE ImportANt for BhVR
---
I think he said yeah but you know he'd have to be paid and stuff
---
Only Nurses run Shadowborn really.
---
I didn't know Legion could slide over pallets. I had just thrown down a pallet and was waiting to see what the Legion would do and when it vaulted over the pallet, I almost shit myself. I was so confused
---
Im a killer main don't you dare talk about those perks to me!!
---
You can tell this screenshot is from the JP version because 4Kids didn't edit out the rifle.
---
I can find iron will survs really easy, unless I'm spirit so I think you're facing brainlets.
---
Omg i love the omegalunge. On Autohaven you can lunge to cover a solid 40% of the entire outer loop with the pallet down. You literally just have to guess left or right side of the pallet and can just lung through the entire side.
---
aesthetically, your wrong.
---
How good are you? Max I have is rank 10 at 10 months survivor, but I plan to get rank 8 at max.
---
Best tier list
---
I will be sure to do him right in the future and edit these for any future reposts. ^^ Thanks for pointing it out.
---
Not without third party controller port modifiers. You can't plug in a Kb/m and play
---
Which killer are you playing? Also i’m still waiting for k+m support it’s gonna be so much better once i can have that.
---
I've seen browns = babies, usually silent or sweet
---
Yellows = occasional egregious deranker very proud of themself for bullying, at least one instance of the worst Killer I've ever seen
---
Greens = Toxic majority; the weaker your Killer the more disrespect
---
Purple = Generally cool
---
Red = Chernobyl
---
The apostrophe shows possession.
---
problem with ranking Killer perks is different perks have various rankings depending on the Killer. Survivor perks? Sure, rank them all you want. Killer perks have to many variables to really be ranked. For instance, you have Shadowborn in F teir. Now normally, sure, Shadowborn is pretty bad, but on Nurse? The strongest Killer in the game? Shadowborn is down right disgustingly good and I've never seen a legitimate Nurse main not use it.
---
Slugging isn’t fun to play against. It’s kind of really annoying, actually. Maybe not for you when you play killer, but for survivors that don’t have no mither, it’s not fun.
---
Yes, Billy is best killer on console generally.
---
I'm a PC player but have played PS4.
---
I did this last night. Loaded into a lobby full of default perkless Dwights. Thought nothing of it til I couldn't find anyone and gens weren't getting done. Then I kept hearing lockers and figured out that they were all playing locker Dwights. I let the last one go cuz I found it hilarious.
---
Run PWYF. It makes it so much better because you can abuse it to get free stacks and end chases super fast.
---
PC
---
*uses self heal*
---
Literally everyone: UsE tEaMwOrK tO wIn
---
... did you put nails in that pumpkin?
---
Incredibly! Honestly they are great perks. If you run those with Fire Up you just get stronger as the game goes on!
---
Everyone understood that it was a joke. But your fuck up was an even bigger one mr how to get downvoted 200+ times in one comment chain.
---
I’m using it for killers with a normal terror radius, (32 meters) and not taking powers in mind
---
Plus it's not like the perk removes all of the Spirit's bs, it just makes it less effective. 
---
It's still a weighted coinflip in her favour on top of other annoying stuff.
---
He almost looks naked in the first pic
---
We're getting a game with Mr. X playable! Project Resistance.
---
Make ebony stay 1 hook but make the other 2 2 hooks at least. It’s ultrarare it needs to be good at something.
---
Brings a whole new meaning to Devour Hope.
---
You're welcome. Just want to make sure you didn't get called racist for not knowing he wasn't white. 
---
Anywho, I love your work! Can't wait to see more!
---
What the fuck
---
Ya but at least he’s ok with doing more
---
Wait what happen
---
Obviously, the terror radius would be replaced by "X Gon Give it to Ya" in the distance.
---
He was getting bullied a lot by survivors
---
girl funny y jy face and cat funhy
---
Be one with the bush, be one with the dark corner of the map. 
---
Become the blendette.
---
As good as he is, the survivors are the power role in this game, sometimes depending on map/killer, the game isn’t winnable.
---
Triple, take it or leave it
---
If I've learned anything here, it's to never wait at the gates when Michael's involved.
---
we really back in 2017, huh?
---
&gt; Petition to ban those people to teach them a lesson
---
They played with OP stuff, doesn't mean they deserve to be banned. They definitely should see how it feels on the other side though 100%
---
Oh man yeah, just read it now ( haven’t really touched Freddy yet) ; that would definitely pair well
---
Iridescent Head actually just forces users to disconnect at random and IP bans them from forums so they can't tell anyone. It's all part of the plan.
---
Ya you get to kill everyone guy I’d say that’s pretty good
---
Does it honestly tilt people if the killer hits you on the hook?
---
this has been happening to everyone. it will be fixed in the next patch
---
It's way slower. I've been practicing hitting the skill checks and now I can hit them almost everytime. Even if I miss a couple it's way better to just hop off the gen for 3 seconds and then get back to work. I don't even need to waste time looking for ruin anymore. If I see it though i'll cleanse it.
---
Thank you, it's been really passing me off and just had to make sure.
---
How did he not hear you lol
---
Am not the only one that thought something else was leaking out of her mouth right.... Right..?
---
Yeah but it doesn't look epic like this
---
Basically saying “all hail a broken crutch perk”
---
But they trash talk you even harder if you play any other killer....
---
I mean, thats just straight up fax. Freddys hat is more iconic though…
---
that would defeat the whole purpose of a mori, without one, 3 downs you die, with one, 2 downs you die. Also, they cant be kept through a ward since they are an offering, and the ebony (ultra rare) is the only one that can mori the whole squad. They are strong for sure, but to where near what needs to be fixed first.
---
Someone please ring the shame bell.
---
Ace is, like, the quietest character in the game. Pretty much has a built-in iron will.
---
Have you ever gotten toxic messages when you down an unhooked survivor because he was just walking away cause that seems to be a reoccurring thing for me and I wonder how many people do that
---
BHVR has already said that keyboard/mouse use on console is considered cheating, as it provides an unfair advantage.
---
Me being wrong, doesn't make you right.
---
Its good that someone saw that stream today too. It really made me sad man ):
---
HAHAHA WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HAHAHAH NOTHING TO SEE HERE DEVS
---
We could make moris not be a free win before getting down to do that.
---
the legends were true
---
*S-Mart music stops*
---
&gt;  in a pile of plague corpses,
---
I love your ideas, but this just sounds dangerous
---
Yeah , they bullied him too hard ,I genuinely felt his pain and saw how he felt really dead inside after those toxic matches
---
That no animation on vaulting is some BS that I don't quite understand why she has. And honestly I just want the collision removed. That's some serious BS too.
---
Ah
---
Considering where the game has come from, it would absolutely be survivors that started and caused it.  
---
Instablind Flashlights, Infinite Loops, Infinite Loops made stronger with unhealthy perks like Balanced Landing and more stuff that made the game heavily survivor focused in advantage.  
---
Survivors absolutely started it with the bullying tools they were given so early on.
---
No hes talking out of his ass. People just run Iron Will because its insanely good, makes mindgames at certain tiles impossible to pull off for the killer
---
Theres no need to run urban evasion with it.
---
Well, it's easy to dodge Legion in their power, considering you cannot get downed in his/her power. Vault speed is way less than survivor vault speed, so just vault a pallet, wait for Legion to vault, vault back, and you can essentially survive Legion very easily.
---
Running Spine chill and sprint burst basically guarantees you will not get hit by Legion. Cool killer I play, but sadly the weakest killer. :(
---
FUCK I WANT TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS BUT THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE
---
Definitely had it happen. Does it suck when it happens? Oh yeah; I play both roles as much as possible and that's something that really sucks when you get unhooked at a bad time and it happen to you, but it's not worth spamming others.
---
It be like that sometimes
---
These survivors feeling entitled enough to complain even after they won really gave me the last bit man
---
And again I play the game cause I actually want to play it, it wait for a lobby, spend 2 minutes on the hook or 4 on the ground and have to find another lobby.
---
the devs will prob never add that so you may be waiting for a long time honestly
---
No it literally doesn't exist anymore, facecamping was when the killer would stand in a survivors face and block the unhook prompt, this was eliminated with the update that made it possible to unhook from all sides
---
I do this even when my teammates were absolutely undeserving of it, don’t know why.
---
A BNP can be used four times per match as well, once per survivor.
---
You've seen how badly Brand New Part got nerfed, so clearly the devs think that as well.
---
Killers are the Power Role. That's how the game is supposed to be. I've survived against Ebony Moris, that's one of the reasons why the Hatch exists.
---
It won’t happen but i can still dream.
---
Before I started playing, I watched a video on all the killers and I guess I didn’t really pay attention much in some parts, because I thought the Legion was completely different than they are in game. I thought that they were like a cult of many people with one main killer, and a bunch of NPCs that served other functions, such as telling the actual killer the location of survivors whenever the survivors were spotted by the NPC Legion. I assumed the Legion was far larger than just four stupid teens, I thought it was a large cult, something that can actually be intimidating. I really think the current legion sucks in a ton of ways, I dislike their lore and I dislike the way they play. There definitely should be multiple legion members per game, in fact I think the whole killer should be reworked. I think their lore should be changed to, it kind of sucks as it is right now.
---
She actually used to have a really cool animation on the PTB where she phased through the vault itself. Idk where did that go.
---
+1 on the collision removal, that's really annoying.
---
nope, slugging the second to last is a common practice to get 4k's since otherwise the 4th can just win through getting a lucky hatch spawn.
---
They should rework it and make it like kindred, 
---
Your mates see the aura of the killer and the person when the person who has the perk equipped is being chased
---
They are abusing the shit out of instaheals and OoO bec ThEY WOnt be FUn afTER PaTCH 
---
This really took a toll of me thinking to play beads every game cuz those dudes might be against ms one day
---
I find playing against slugging killers fun, it's a nice change of pace. People seem to think of "slugging gameplay" just from the perspective of a survivor crawling around on the floor, which, sure, is not so fun, but then neither is being on a hook, yet we don't associate the normal hook-based gameplay with being literally imprisoned on a hook all the time. Slugging means less downtime for both sides, more chaseplay, more rescue scenarios, a different way for the round to play out than the majority of other rounds.
---
If it isn't fun (or it's going to not you fewer points) then maybe don't do it? If you're as good as you claim to be then 20,000 points once per day shouldn't matter to you. Nobody is forcing you to complete all of your rituals.
---
Sure! Feel free to do so.
---
I like survivor but I usually get annoying killers that camp or tunnel so it’s hard to play survivor but when I play killed I get toxic survivors so either way I have to face off against toxic people but we shouldn’t get messages when you die
---
This is too funny
---
good ol' blood point bubba. bbq and chilli is good for getting BP
---
Urban Evasion is better replaced with an exhaustion perk or even Fixated.

---
Laurie cosmetics all the way! Give us Grandma Laurie BHVR!
---
Dude this guy is so chill I love it.
---
you do, idk what these people are on about
---
Title success.
---
you're either salty or a selfish piece of shit. sorry we assume the better of the two
---
I'm starting to get that vibe
---
I don't think I've ever been able to relate to the "its rank reset boyz here we go playing with noobs" sentiment. 
---
 I've steadily been in red ranks for a couple years now and when it resets I play with the same exact fucking people (ranks 9-11 who were previously just 1-4). Even with the new update displaying player ranks, I don't see a huge gap in ranks come reset unless I'm paired with an swf.
---
No, that's what every Survivor's gameplay being identical does.
---
Although I'll give you one thing, their sounds and models are of varying noticiability.
---
Yea I always try and be nice to a killer doing poorly and 9 times out of 10 they take advantage of it because they were already in a shitty mood from losing. Just yesterday I stood still to let a hillbilly chainsaw me because he literally couldn’t catch anyone for four gens, he was extremely bad. Dude proceeded to face camp me (I mean nose to fucking nose) for zero reason. 
---
Another time I gave a Myers a hook because he was doing equally as poorly and he too camped my hook. At the end I asked him why and told him I was simply giving him points and he responded “not my fucking problem you died”... 
---
I will still continue to be nice to killers if they have a shit game but I think the reason people are more reluctant to do this as survivor is because the killer does have the power to stop you from playing altogether. At least as killer if I’m stomping survivors and choose to be nice I still have the option to “win”.
---
I hope they will have a collaboration for the RE3 Remake promo campaign. We really need Nemesis in the game, he'd fit perfectly.
---
Guys.
---
Just do bones.
---
Depends on your skin. Salmon Claudette is what real heroes wear.
---
Yup. Within a week or so reset I find myself in the red ranks again. I'm by no means an a great survivor.
---
You actually don't need to be a dick at this point, but alright have your internet "win."
---
That wasn't very groovy of you
---
Dwight Schrute goes against everything this description says about Dwight lol
---
That's why momma says not to play with your food
---
myers and clown do that
---
The entity wants op to have a really toxic time
---
When you say that, do you mean they like combat roll through one?
---
this sounds like Jack Black in jumanji all over again
---
Iron Will is always on for me. I feel absolutely naked and out of my element without it.
---
Myers and clown dont have that anime protagonist vibe tho
---
I give non-downing Killers their last hit if it doesn't require loitering at the gates. I once got a pretty big stack of extra BP for letting a Legion pop me on the way out, since he'd been chasing two of my other teammates at the time.
---
Same, I really loved it!
---
Doesn't know about Franklin's?
---
Thanks man, all about the good times G.
---
I dunno outside of general game sense a few things I generally follow are.
---
Dashes are for mind gaming short loops and hitting survivors in dead zones.
---
Learn whether or not they respect your helmets.(Hand em out as fast as possible if they don't)
---
Whispers will help you learn what range you need to crouch at if you don't know the general terror radius range.
---
And gen grabbing is more viable than it seems as your terror radius doesn't come back immediately, rather incrementally.
---
Lol , already having downvotes , seriously people don’t understand
---
Oh, sorry. I just saw the sarashi + jacket thing. All she'd need then is a bokken.
---
Joker (2019)
---
I actually dislike playing against her with the more mechanic based reason being that everyone has to remain sick and broken in fear of her emerald splash
---
Nana wasn't franklins, my character literally drops the item in front of him...totally like wtf hah
---
I use Iron Will and Spine Chill literally every survivor game. They're both CRIMINALLY underrated. Watch Otzdarva's video on Spine Chill for why it's actually an amazing perk. As for Iron Will, I lose killers literally every single game with it. It completely silences your character when injured, so if you can lose line of sight and you're smart, you WILL escape from a chase because you're practically untraceable. Especially on darker maps where blood is harder to see.
---
Not directed at the op but if you stop clowning on us clowns and and doctors, etc. You'll see more of us. The only killers I've talked to that only play the top three are burnt out from toxic survivors
---
I never said "noobs", most people on red ranks only main nurse or spirit
---
That’s why I always run Iron Will and Dead Hard
---
a lesson to be learned by all: greed and avarice are the true killers of men
---
Its a perk thats above average but not userful to take if that makes sense. Its effect is only telling you when to gtfo and that is told to you anyway by music and footsteps. That being said, it is immensely helpful against stealth killers but those are far and few.
---
It happens to me quite often so maybe you're lucky? Or im unlucky? Idk

I... honestly don't know. I used to main survivor but have been playing 50/50 since a little before ghost face came out. I never really see plague when playing survivor but she's one of my favorite killers to play. I think a lot of people just don't quite realize exactly how good she is
---
I only have bbq on nurse and I’m tryna get those blood points. But I don’t run any add one since I’m putting all the np into other killers and survivors. I’ll stop once I get bbq on another killer.
---
They're both situational use, but balanced landing let's you do a lot of loops thanks to the passive effect. Also lithe can mess you up if you don't want to leave the loop yet or get forced to vault in a bad direction.
---
Some people don’t like losing
---
I’m just saying as a opinion , spirit is balanced , iron will is amazing against all killer but is really effective against spirit , it’s not a mandatory perk against spirit but helps a lot in mind game , beads might need to be ultra rare or changed a bit but she has to exist as a power role against really really good survivors or the game is just unbalanced in many aspects in a m1 killers place , you need to know that spirit is a m2 killer. Not m1 so normal looping tactics don’t work , there are many ways in which a spirit can be countered
---
Anyone Purple rank or higher tends to amaze me. I am a potato survivor that easly loses rank points to Ebony Moris and off-hook tunnels, plus bad teammates who disconnect or suicide :v
---
But during the PTB, I have had people beg for my rank 11, so I guess red ranks is as bad as people say.
---
You don't NEED both, but you'll want to find some way to compensate for the lost chase.
---
Dwight is probably best for a new player. He's passively useful to a degree and Bond gives you an idea of how other players behave.
---
I PIPPED WHEN I CLEARLY SHOULD HAVE BARELY SAFETY PIPPED AND I DEPIPPED WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT BELOW A DOUBLE. I DONT GET THE RANKING SYSTEM.
---
Probably toothpicks
---
Idk why i said nails that’s what i meant. I’m tired.
---
I'm having the exactly opposite of that.  
---
I'm just chilling out with no intention of killing anyone since some time ago, but if I snowball early then there's a high chance someone is DCing. I even stopped using her power mid-chase.
---
I guess that makes sense, since I play on weekends. I know basically almost everything about the game, I just panic easily during high tension games. Either that or I am suffering from off-hook tunnels, suicides, and disconnects.
---
Well that's not very nice
---
OMG Noooo! Lol that would have made me gasp!
---
I'd like some simple ones for killers, like a yes or no head nod. It's not at all yesterday, but I want them, in particular for Ghostface.
---
Just make it so a survivor can’t cleanse until broken, and Plague cannot ingest corruption until she is back in vile purge.
---
Shirt, then pants, then face (i think)
---
One day this community will unify.
---
Sadly ill be dead till then
---
I literally had a guy comment on one of my artworks I posted to circumvent the fact I have profile comments disabled to tell me what I was a furry Russian scum bag who tunneled off hook. That was after I gave him a “+Rep Good Survivor” on his profile.
---
I PLAYED FOR 10 HOURS AND DIED MAYBE 3 TIMES. IT SAID I PIPPED EVERYTIME, BUT WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO GONTO THE NEXT RANK, I WAS PUT AT THE SAME RANK WITH 1 PIP. I RANKED UP 3 TIMES IN 10 HOURS. SAME HAPPENED WITH MY SWF. WTF. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST RANK 7 BUT GOT STUCK AT 11.
---
“Moris are rare”
---
This topic seems to hit hard for you. You've commented up and down the thread bitching.
---
You're definitely the toxic, teabagging asshole that gets tunneled a lot.
---
I had a game earlier where the opposite happened. Dweet went to rescue meg from the basement and met a trapper down there and I popped the last gen as he got downed so his adrenaline popped and everyone escaped. It was pretty epic timing. I'm sorry yours went poorly though, very unfortunate.
---
That's the main reason I stop using it. I use to run SB as well, and position really is key. I really just wanted to free up some perk slots, and like you said headphones really help a lot.
---
I love it lmao. I have no idea why I ignored these add-ons entirely, but I’m glad I did because I have like 30-40 of each one.
---
OmegaLunge spirit is the new Meta boi’s, spread the word and enjoy ice-skating Survivors to death
---
This comment chain explains why people downvote genuinely good suggestions to the game. Rank 20s
---
It's not gonna happen. Michael's not a trap killer.
---
Yeah it feels really bad to see the god pallet going down like this
---
Yeah but it wouldn’t. His comes with being one shot for majority of the game
---
FUCKIN A MAN! I GET WHY KILLERS HATE THEM IF THEY GO UP AGAINST THEM ALL THE TIME. I RARELY USE THEM SO THIS NERF BUGS ME. I GET IT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD, BUT FUCK THAT FOR US THAT RARELY USE THEM AND SAVE THEM UP FOR WHEN WE WANT TO USE BPS OR AN ESCAPE CAKE.
---
Are you a smooth brain or ? Because I said "Aesthetically" Do you even know what that word means ?
---
This youtuber named Pain Reliever has a video on why spine chill is an underrated perk, you should watch that video.
---
Plz kill it with fire
---
Yeah, but it's fucking badass so China can get fucked.
---
Yeah I definitely wouldn't feel bad about this one.
---
I'LL TAKE RUIN OVER LULLABY ANYDAY, BUT THAT'S JUST ME.
---
Just enjoy it, i have over 20 pages of hate from playing killer. From time to time i go back to read all these salty comments and it's just too funny and always brings back memories. Wouldn't want to miss it to be honest.
---
When you remember you dont need it because nurse
---
Do I need HTC Vive for this?
---
Two killers?
---
Random n00b question, is it possible for killers to get items outside of just the blood web? I was watching a video a while back where a level 40~ killer had like 30-40 of most of their items. I've never leveled a killer that high but I have several survivors around that level and I would have to farm items in matches for days to get that many. Is that normal?
---
The real question is why was David King grunting while cleansing a totem? I mean, not that I'm opposed to his sexy ass grunting, but...does a totem require that much exertion?
---
Yeah it also feels like your cheated when multiple survivors literally leave the game early with a key but hey survivors don’t seem to want to bring that up
---
And you all wonder why billys face is so broken
---
HEY, SOMETIMES WE GOTTA TAKE A QUICK SHIT OR PISS SO WE DONT READY UP AND GO INTONA MATCH AFK.
---
I just hit survivors who try to vault back over the pallet, very reactable with a high mouse sensitivity to turn around and shiv them. I've seen it work on other people though, and I've done it as a cheeky trick, but it's by no means a counter.
---
Robert Englund Freddy
---
Yeah you’re right , sorry about that , the thing is at times when you play something that survivors don’t like , dc in loading or general dc /suicide on hook which is why at times i use entitled but yeah not everyone is entitled
---
IM TIRED OF THE GOD DAMN HADDONFIELD MAP WHEN IM PLAYING KILLER
---
So is Play w/ your food
---
I don’t want that. I want to just destroy a vault window by rushing into it. No longer vaultable. And they can look as menacing as possible doing it
---
Dude what a toxic cunt killer mam
---
Imo STBFL should go up to a and MYC go down to a as well
---
Also, cleanse if one cleanses. No point in being one shot and loud asf. You can stun her out of Corrupt or even hide it out but not cleansing when there's that one guy that keeps purging is basically throwing.
---
Spirit with stridor would like a word.
---
It would be a coding miricale too. Anytime you change the code something will mess up.
---
Yeah, Ghostface shaking his head in the garage in the first movie was great, I'd definitely be okay with that emote, 
---
please no dance or joke-like emotes though, that'd be absolutely immersion breaking and plain terrible
---
Epic
---
If they do it will just prove how fucking much of an asshole they are like seriously you were just talking about how you didn’t like seeing Otz get bullied and that was enough to set these fuckers off like what are they mad that you dare called out survivors for bullying someone also these are probably the same people that make posts about how anti fun some killers are all while running OoO insta heals DS Adrenaline Prove Thyself
---
Nea finally an official killer
---
argnold schwarnesnznenaegger
---
Oh dang I better start killing Dwight's then
---
It takes a high-level internet to be on both a Venezuelan AND Australian server at the same time
---
Hard disagree. The massive difference between red ranks and everything else is killer variety. I would legit quit if I pushed to rank 1 every reset, I need variety not sweaty billy/spirit/nurse every fucking game.
---
Check my flair first, and I hit rank 2 killer last season and rank 6 survivor. I play killer almost every weekday and survivor only on weekends. I play both sides so I’m reasonable on both sides complaints about perks and etc. Not every killer is one sided and only thinks about himself you know, granted I’ve only been playing this game for about 3 months
---
I want to find a clip with me in it so bad
---
Legion overall is just a very weak killer with too much drawbacks for a power that can barely be called a power. :/
---
You didn’t need to comment in the first place. All you did was being combative energy, so don’t cry that I’m a dick and I “win” now that you’re getting downvoted.
---
About 5 tiers above Micheal
---
Which killer has that mask?
---
I didn't know I needed this until I had it. Thank you.
---
😂😂😂
---
Bruh penny wise is OG from the horror genre too lmaoo. Maybe you aren’t cultured enough to know It came out in 1990...  that being said though, I can’t see him having any type of power that would fit into Dbd so I’m down for a new bhvr designed killer
---
The point of dailies is to give you a side objective and a reward. Its not about my skill level and also idk why you are coming at me with ferocity. Not sure why you commented this.
---
Aren't all DbD funny moments videos basically garbage?
---
Legions Stab is pretty much his basic attack. It has to be bc of the way he coded. I dont know if they changed it but his stab applies status just like a perk would, but plagues throw up is an attack too but doesnt apply anything but broken and sickness. Its itneresting to think about if they ever did go about changing the way status works
---
But you unload your entire clip into the killer and it has like, no effect.
---
Dude it’s Jumanji with DBD
---
I personally agree, but they can be hard to compare.
---
Pop is stall that isn't passive and only starts bringing in stall in the mid game.
---
Ruin on the other hand is completely passive and works at the start, but will likely be gone by mid game.
---
One is a psudeo snowball stall (Pop) while the other one grants a bit of leeway at the beginning so you can get the first down before the first gen goes (Ruin). If you want an ultimate stall build, Run Pop and Ruin so the game comes to a halt if you keep pressure up.
---
🦀Corrupt Intervention Gang Rise Up🦀
---
Console players in a nutshell
---
I hate when survivors do this it’s like fucking spitting in the killers face and it never feels good
---
If you mean a debuff to infected survivors, thanataphobia seems to be a pretty standard Plague perk.
---
Well, The strategy i tend to try is to avoid cleansing until the random does, Then avoid cleansing (still uncleansed) Until she finds that fountain. Once that happens everyone uses a fountain and gen rush. One game i was able to literally dodge her green and red puke all game (It was the weird connection thing where a/thee survivor/s are very hard to hit) it felt really awesome and at that point the puke didn't seem too op but every standard game it's brutal. I think she just needs a rework
---
She’s easily countered by not cleansing unless you have a pretty rare add on that reveals the location of the infected but even then they can cleanse and just stealth around you if they’re good enough to wait out her red vomit or cleanse in an out of the way spot so it’s inconvenient for you to go there especially when trying to apply pressure mid to late game
---
It gets even better when u see the killer coming to 'stop you' but u stay for the greater good, an also is only 1 hit right? You can kite a little bit for sure.
---
The hole in the middle of Badham preschool. A few killers like Demo and Pig can clear it.
---
Run pop with corrupted intention
---
I love it!!
---
You just don't want to use them, because if it's a bad game, they're wasted. I get you.
---
This is locker dwight erasure.
---
Rank Reset. Isn’t it great?
---
In this specific case I don't know, but in other cases they're replaced guns with toy guns, sci-fi laser guns (because they're not real, so it's okay?), cartoony melee weapons, or even just replaced the gun with [ominous pointing](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cyt5wvcVHE4/maxresdefault.jpg).
---
I don't know how what i said is being misinterpreted as only playing your main.  It was supposed to state, maybe more clearly, that when leveling up a character, you don't have to deal with the 1 perk  games if you don't want to, you can farm points with your main, and then level up characters to get 4 perk slots and have gotten some better perks to choose from.  I have my jane and my claudette build very differently, i'm well aware how builds work.  But please don't change what i said to something it wasn't.
---
This is incredibly sad..
---
PA4 DASH BOARDING SHOULD BE MET WITH PUNISHMENT!! NOT ONLY ARE YOU WAISTING YOUR KWN TIME, YOU WAIST EVERYONES TIME JUST AND HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR!! 
---
ALSO THE RANKING SYSTEM!! I’M A RANK 11 SURVIVOR AND GOT PULLED ALONG WITH RANK 20 AND 19s WHO FAIL TO ESCAPE A CHASE WITH THE KILLER LEAVING JUST TWO OF US BECAUSE I RAN INFRONT OF THE OTHER SURVIVOR AND LEAD THE DEMOGORGON ON. 8 MINUTES AND A MAXED ESCAPE/CHASE GO BY AND THE CLAUDETTE ONLY GOT ONE GENERATOR. THE KILLER GETS ME AND HOOKS ME ONLY TO LEAD ME TO KOBE OFF THE HOOK AND GETS KNOCKED DOWN LEADING THE DEMOGORGON TO SLUG ME. EVENTUALLY I FIND THE HATCH AND AS THE CLAUDETTE FINALLY ASCENDS THE DEMOGORGON FINDS ME WHILE IM PATIENTLY WAITING FOR THE HATCH TO OPEN. RIGHR AS HE PICKS ME UP THE HATCH OPEN.
---
LASTLY FINALLY GOT AROUND TO BUY THE LEGION WITH IRIDESCENT SHARDS AND WENT UP AGAINST A SWF GROUP WITH TWO TOOL BOXES, A MEDKIT AND FLASHLIGHT. THEY EVENTUALLY T-BAG AT THE GATE WITH ME UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING.
---
I'd love to, but I don't care either way, I just want new stuff.
---
They try to bully Myers and can't get a reaction from him other than a blank stare so they just back away slowly
---
I'd definitely vote that she is the worst to rank up with.  And she gets scraps for bloodpoints too.
---
looks like i got a serious answer to a shitpost, thanks for the advice though. i usually play survivor with my friends, let the god that is shirtless david run killer around while the rest of us genrush as fast as we can before he inevitably gets hooked and i have to sneak in for the save, rinse and repeat unless jake tries to use head on in the middle of a chase and gets pulled right out of his locker and thrown in the basement
---
I think with the amount of hours people put in the game they just end up with more items over time. Especially if you keep levelling characters past 50 (like to get all of the perks) you end up collecting a ton of them
---
Who else read this in saminations voice?
---
For anyone wondering, [this](https://twitter.com/jo_saaa/status/1071058358054993920?s=21) is the source!
---
That’s a nice 1/4th of your outfit there, can’t wait to see the rest of it, let alone the mask,
---
Well I'm not trying to get hit
---
I would play and rename my self to Basements Closed (a reference to Pools Closed) and body block the basement
---
Getting shot from across the map.  Sounds fun
---
Save until the next
---
Same happens to me
---
It came out in the 1990s and was not a hit success. It was a cult classic film but Halloween and Nightmare, both in the 80s, were far more important than It was to horror's development.  Pumpkin Head and Child's Play are both cult films too but they weren't as groundbreaking as either Nightmare or Halloween.
---
Saw is similar as that was a GROUNDBREAKING variation on the horror genre.
---
Maybe you aren't cultured enough to actually know that.  If we talkin shit than I'll take part.
---
Lol and I love the down votes keep them coming you tunneling trash killers!!!
---
Jesus, how old is this?
---
I’m not saying take another hit I just think the fact that you had time to finish the gen in front of the killer and throw down the pallet is like a punch to the balls I mean how much fun is it to be fucking screwed over that hard an not be able to do anything
---
I’m Scaroused.
---
Don’t freak out it’s just a subtle hint towards the incoming Slenderman Licensing
---
Thank you, this was very informative.
---
Spirit , she justs goes through it
---
All this comment made me think of is that one Pools Closed meme from back in the day
---
What were your complaints?
---
Corrupted Intervention?
---
I can only go by what I've experienced, and that certainly is not 7 times in a row. Fuck, the only time I can remember facing the same killer was 2-3 times in a row and that was a huntress. I get a pretty healthy mix.
---
Totem cleansing 2: electric boogaloo
---
If it was a shot post there's a flair for that lol Most killers have a gimmick that can make the game fairly frustrating such as a pig who follows you around, A camping cannibal or Tombstone in general. And usually a plague can end a chase moderately fast due to weakening them to the broken status, then hitting them but from there the player has a fairly long recovery period in place of doing other stuff unless he risks a 1 hit down.
---
No since it's almost always swf getting info on,where you're at all game.
---
I agree with this .. I had a post removed bc I responded to a person and they said it’s personal drama or some shit
---
there's 3 more survivors than killers?? and nobody wants to play a 3v1...
---
I complained that the game was broken and that the dev don’t care
---
Yes please!
---
I'm with you. He could have slugged him or hooked him and that would have done the trick. Seems like he was just being silly to me.
---
Did you have any connection issues right around then? I've had that happen before when the connection lags out, lost a ton of bloodpoints.
---
But it's still a problem with solo matchmaking. Absolutely no fucking reason a solo rank 15 should be in my game when I am rank 3.
---
I'm not coming at you with ferocity at all- I just don't understand why you would be bothered by this. You have the choice of either playing a sub-par killer for a match or two and get some points in return, or you could not. Unless I'm missing something it seems like a very straightforward decision.
---
Also just FYI the Nancy skin won’t be out with the update, they only release one or two skins a week and her and Steve’s supposedly won’t be out until the beginning of November
---
This man must still live in his mother basement. Did she forget to cut the crust off your PB&amp;J or did she not tuck you in last night and read you a bedtime story?
---
Wraith
---
Dude leatherface is great if the survivors are boosted around pallets and if you juke well you always get them with the chainsaw. Leatherface isn’t the worst killer at all, nurse is. Indeed she is great on pc, but she’s such garbage on other platforms that it drops her to the F-tier, and another bad killer would be hag against urban evasion players, or legion against good players. Leatherface isn’t that bad. If any killer is bad in dbd rn, its the new freddy. Its garbage. go back. hes bad. no. never again.
---
T-800?
---
No.
---
T-1000 with hands that turn into silver blades when you attack, hell yes. Maybe an ability to temporarily morph into the last survivor hit within a certain amount of time? Sign me up.
---
 I bet you some kid is going to trip on those stairs and go face first into the spiky pumpkin
---
Oh boy I can’t wait for new killer moris instead of new perks and a new killer that sounds like so much fun smh
---
Nothing out of the ordinary. Everything was running pretty smooth until the killer had finally left, then there was a tiny bit slow down but that always happens.

Only some Virgin nerd would want to be a moderator for a video game forum. That’s the real geek you fucking loser. Bring your mother over here so I can fuck her in the ass and make your twin brother born you piece of shit!

No stairs. Just flat sidewalk.
---
There is still a wide range of skill levels at red ranks. I watch good killer streams like zubatlel and scottjund. Red ranks can make some potato ass mistakes.
---
Why not run it all ;D
---
Ruin, pgtw, thana, etc 
---
Just have it all lol
---
Happened to me with Michael. The same amount of times too! Kept getting Michael on either Macmillan or Crotus Prenn.
---
Honestly ranks 5-10 right after rank reset are easily the worst games. Lower rank survivors in the lobby, plus every killer is going full sweat mode to try and get back to red ranks fast. The last two times I played the day of rank reset I went against more instasaw Billys, prayer bead spirits, and omegablink nurses than the entire rest of the month at red ranks.
---
One of my top wanted licensed killers, he would 100% fit into the game. Terminator had horror vibes and that's all DBD requires. One of my ideas was that you get to play as Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 until 2 gens are completed. After that, he sets the ground around him on fire, burning off his flesh and becoming the T-800 endo-skeleton. I would imagine you get some buffs while in the endo-skeleton mode.
---
It's a good perk, really helps against stealth killers but kinda pointless against others so I don't bring it personally. Just gotta have a general idea who you're against and where they are.

The whole game is geared towards letting the killer win. Barely any way to beat them. They can chase you down in 3 seconds, they can camp you into Oblivion, see you when you heal, see you when you're repairing, close the hatch immediately, make you scream, see you when they down or hook someone, see where you run, there's hooks only 3 seconds away from each other all over the map, they walk so fast and have such a short distance to go you can't wiggle off, they can slug everyone right out the gate, it takes a very long time to repair a gen if you're not rushing. And yeah, you barely get any BP as a survivor but get like 20k for doing nothing but loading into the match and hooking all survivors. 
---
It's insane how much killers are favored in this game.
---
And you dont even get to see them except while loading, and maybe during a mori.
---
I mean, didn’t a couple people get attack by a demo in the show(i forget as i haven’t seen it in a while) and they didn’t exactly do too hot after that.

Why is that?  You wanna use grown up words or keep name calling?
---
"Excuse me, what is a 'pallet?' Also, can you go through walls? Because I can." - Nurse
---
"No..." - Legion (and every other killer)
---
I thought this was a funny tidbit from Samination's video, but it also pretty accurately describes just how strong Nurse is. 
---
So what if she's slower now? Pallets and windows and walls AND FLOORS! are still useless, and a survivor can only run in a straight line for so long before reaching the edge of the map. 
---
At least Nurse's map pressure is weaker, considering her chase game has not been dented one bit.
---
And before anyone says anything, no I wasn’t being toxic. No teabagging, flashlight clicking, emoting etc. I was literally just playing solo survivor and led the killer on a chase for like a minute tops and then they DCed.
---
Damn michelle
---
I mean i understand but it's really the easiest thing to do in that situation. I'd rather do that then run away and risk getting downed.Also is I were to run then he could have damaged the gen and i don't want that since the gen was 1 second from being done. So i mean yeah it's mean but that's how it is sometimes.

I think that dude's a little stoned

Survivors get free items you get a little bit of a bonus that probably won’t effect anything sounds fun

Marinara?
---
Look at how far off to the left he is the first time he triggers the trap. That's a bunch of BS if you ask me. It's pretty ridiculous that he gets stopped by his own traps anyways. Personally think he should be able to move for a couple of seconds after stepping in one before stopping to take it off.

You can not like things that survivor has and killer has at the same time!
---
I went against a pig on the Switch version who missed like 6 attacks in a row on me (he was kicking our asses for the whole game before so he wasn't a baby killer) so I just stood there t-bagging him for a solid 10 seconds then DC'd right in his face for the ultimate power move. It was the first and probably only time I'm ever gonna DC.
---
-_-
---
Speeb
---
Yeah I’m saying BHVR should fix that like maybe add a delay on doing gens for as long as the killer is wiping of his weapon this would make it so you can’t fuck over a killer while he sits there powerless to stop you that’s the last thing you want your POWER ROLE to feel is powerless but this game constantly makes killer feel powerless
---
 it’s the same reason I hate how bodyblocking can duck a killer over super hard like what horror movie has anyone seen where a killer has been stopped by a douch standing in the way of him imo killers should push past survivors in some way when they walk into them 
---
Sorry about the side rant about body blocking
---
not s single one of these are good idea
---
Creating infinites wouldn’t be a category it would be considered “other” is what I’m saying
---
or you no gens are done to fast there are multiple videos out there where all 5 gens are done in 4 mins but hey guess the trash killer didn't apply enuf pressure hey
---
I get that killers are going to win probably about 70-80% of the time, but there needs to be SOME reason to play survivor. Blood points needs be at least increase by a minimum of 1.5x

I like to go with Empathy instead of Bond. That way I have the choice of whether to avoid hurt teammates, or go out of my way to help them. The range on Empathy is just too much to pass up for me.

The idea of another gen exploding when you miss a skill check is a really neat idea. Cool concept
---
Hey man, appreciate it. Hopefully you'll enjoy yourself 👌 welcome to the G squad 😁

Same thing just happened to me with a map I found. Did you find yours in game too?
---
I'm up to 28 with the pig and I actually just played 3 games in a row and got all 4. Haven't played for a few months though, not noticing the nerfs.
---
It felt like a lot more Legion players on Xbox when I last played. So weird.
---
Wait, it does? I thought it just auto-cleansed them.
---
Well that's... awkward.
---
So pretty
---
You actually lose distance doing that. You really only should against a Billy that's trying to saw at gates, a huntress/plague with corrupt, or maybe a leatherface. Going around the pole makes the path to the exit longer, and allows the killer to cut you off by running the normal path.

Serious question. Why do you bother using commas but no periods?

Uhh....me too
---
Why did you run the direction of the killer? You could see the aura as you were unhooking. If you ran the other way the other person would’ve gotten hit not you
---
I agree with the blood points lacking but on a lot of maps at high ranks survivors are favored heavily. Being a killer against a high rank SWF is extremely frustrating
---
How about this, DBD can get generous for their fans. 2 killers-Nemesis and Mr.X, and 2 survivors-Leon and Jill :)
---
???? Killers are brought into the realm at the same time because time has no meaning in the Entity’s realm we are talking  about a literal eldrich god so yeah the Entity probably has some time powers
---
I like your no mither change, but IMO 5% haste is a bit much, with hopes 7% you can almost outrun the killer and outrun others like hag and huntress (yes I know no one runs hope but if people can get an op combo they use anything) so maybe 2% would be better. And I’m assuming it wouldn’t show the killer that you’re broken? Anyways, sorry just a no mither fan boy. The other perks look cool! Am a little confused on how open handed would show you the perks though
---
1) I like your ideas 2) for you question survivors can normally see the aura of piles as green if they are within 16 meters but their aura can be shown form a greater range with perks/add-ons (the 16 meters can be boosted by open-handed)
---
Oh yeah i had a nearly clean sweep my first run as Ghost Face. Then again, the very next game ended with not even a single hooking.
---
Imo there are ways to decipher this. I’ve played many online games where you leave a match intentionally you’re punished by at least a wait time. 
---
Also Even if you can’t tell the difference. The odds of actually disconnecting multiple times in a day is unlikely and if that is genuinely happening you probably should check your connection and not play. 
---
Having the multiple offenses should be noted by the developers and consequences should exist. I’m fucking over DCing and I’m playing less and less because of it
---
What the fuck is this
---
10/10
---
As one of the many reasons, alone it's not a big deal, but with everything else, it's pretty rediculous.
---
Whenever I see the Pig I can't stop myself. I feel a desire, the incredible urge to slam my face into a mud puddle. It's beginning to take over my life and I'm not sure what to do

Why would you run away from her in that situation like seriously hell yeah
---
His dad works for bhvr, but regardless this needs a spoiler tag.
---
I’ve been trying to get better at spirit bc my friend bought me her for my birthday, but I ain’t good at all so I get bullied by people with flashlights. I’m rank 17 btw
---
I don't want to wait 30 minutes to get into one match, so I don't play killer.
---
np, hope more people will see this! i love all of this artists stuff 🤗
---
Just my 2 cents.... You don't have to play with him to get his unlock. 
---
For example; I have both him and the hag at level 36 with a METRIC FUCK TON of add-on's, but I've played both like 1-2 times ever. 
---
I just grind with my killer main, get that milli and buy my way to the perks. Then back to my killer main &amp; the 1-2 alternates that I sincerely enjoy. 
---
Mehta waste time using a killer you dislike? Just look at it as a bonus that you can rotate to a killer that's stocked to the gills if you ever get bored.
---
Me a David main when I see a Legion with the similar cosmetic for Julie? Or is it Suzie who got the other day of the dead cosmetic
---
I can tell your a killer main and you probably don't understand how unfair it usually is as a survivor.I see body blocking as a nice counter. I mean think about it it's super difficult to save your teammate without body blocking. I used to killer main and i do understand but I feel like it's a good thing to have. The last thing is that the killer can also body block so i mean you kinda can't talk crap on it if the killer can also do it .
---
So, for want of a point, you call people stupid.
---
Is this 3rd grade?
---
That’s a good point. Who is your main, if you don’t mind me asking? Did you level Hag and Bubba before them, just for their perks?
---
Man the not-baseless message you have here is tragically lost in the fact that you typed it as though you were beating your head against the keyboard.
---
I get downvoted all the time. People like being wrong. And they can be wrong, because there's an objective fact that every Survivor has the same gameplay parameters and the potential to use all the same perks.
---
I've always said how much an amazing cut scene mori he would have. "Look at that, taking it like a champ!"
---
Good instinct. 
---
A week or so ago I went up against a bubba who tried to egc all four of us, but we didn't have a clue it was happening, he ran all the typical perks like ruin and sloppy. When the gates were powered he chainsawed someone down and patrolled around him, nothing shady. The three of us were doing our best to get him up but it takes a bit of time, so as I'm healing a Blendette near the gate to give it another final try I see him pick up the survivor and my spidey sense went off. Something wasn't right. I immediately look at the time remaining near the top. There was about 45 seconds left. 
---
Blood pressure spiked. I had a bad feeling, so I gunned it for the gate leaving my bleeding bush behind and tried for the gate. Without sprint burst I wasn't sure I'd make it. Right as I'm crossing the exit line I get shot straight into the air. Blood warden had happened, and I got out. I go to spectate and see the bleeding bush and some flashlight-clickity nea doing small laps around the exit area with Bubba nodding furiously at the entrance. 
---
Respect the EGC timer kids.
---
All i want is the ability to cancel the window vault midway for both the killer and survivor.
---
Yes, this subreddit being populated by trigger-happy sociopaths really invalidates me.
---
I said he was allowed to like what he wants, then you called me an asshole for no reason and I got downvoted into oblivion. I guess fuck that guy and he isn't allowed to like what he wants? Or are statements only valid in the form of attacking other people around here?
---
I legit get a DC at least once, EVERY OTHER MATCH. It's crazy how frequent. 
---
Before rank reset I was a rank 10 killer and I would hardly ever see them. In the lower ranks all the time, but I think the higher ranks might have more respect or credibility. After reset though, I'm a level 12 and I'm seeing DC's sooooo often. 
---
I have legit NEVER DC'd. It's a game. Let the rank represent your efforts. Don't be a bitch and DC out. As a survivor you fuck over all your teammates and also screw the killer out of a often hard-earned bounty. Just have some honor and go out like a champ.
---
It's a legitimate question, Because I legit said, your wrong because they are all aesthetically different character's, you, being the idiot you are. decided to correct my grammar because you couldn't counter the point, and then just regurgitated what I had already said.
---
Yeah killer is definitely the way to go for BP but person is claiming the game favors the killers for everything which is false
---
Looks dope!
---
Yeah a killer body blocking sucks to go against BUT ITS A JACKED KILLER STANDING IN YOUR WAY I mean for the love of god even I body block as survivor but I feel like a piece of shit afterwards most of the time also survivors will use this at end game to stand in your way and not let you down someone and the teabag yeah that sounds like lots of fun survivors
---
Also BHVR is actually goi g out of their way to make body blocking less viable for killers but survivors can still stand in your way when your finally about to down someone abusing a god loop I mean I don’t think it would hurt anyone to make killers push past survivors and make survivors get pushed to the side maybe slow down the killer a little bit not make them fucking stop in their tracks
---
For me, after the first week or so I see Ghostfaces, (Ghostfaci?) About as often as a huntress, or clown. PS I'm in Xbox so maybe it different
---
Thank you! I didn't even notice that myself!
---
If you're not a Ruin Spirit...
---
...suffer.
---
And like the kiss of an angel, he disappears
---
I’ve only DC’d once I think back when I was like rank 17, but I could have said this better myself.
---
Lmao, what a bunch of potatoes.
---
 Well then
---
Don't stay at gate, especially against myers
---
people never learn
---
How did you actually type that that fast
---
I don't care one way or the other, but unless the other person ninja edited, I don't see where they called you an asshole.  
---
Also, unless you ninja edited as well, I don't see where you told the person they are allowed to like what they want.  
---
I'm getting a strong victim mentality vibe right now, unless I'm mistaken. Just take it easy, my friend. Hope you feel better
---
Fats fingers
---
Pretty sure my dumbass could be very entertaining, I make questionable decisions 50% of the time.
---
Yeah with the upcoming nerf to insta heals, survivors are burning through their stocks of styptics and syringes. Its been rough.
---
What rank are you
---
U can on ps4 i tried
---
1 minute is a long ass time in this game, you can down and hook the unhooker, find a wounded survivor, down them, pick them up and oh yeah it's person who got unhooked 50 seconds ago lol
---
I have all of the questions
---
There was one clip in one of the ochido's funny moments videos (I don't watch anything else from him)
---
Someone was in the basement, healthy, and Wraith was lunging at them. In the middle of the swing, the last gen got poped, then they got hit, NOED, then NOED got cleansed before the wraith has even started cleaning his weapon.
---
It was amazing.
---
"I might be the only one who can actually speak in this realm, but holy fuck even I don't have words for that."
---
That sounds almost as fun as running PWYF on Myers and the obsession is the fully immersed claudette that refuses to leave the corner of the map
---
Almost
---
Yes, everyone has this problem. Its not you.
---
Because she's low-mid tier and requires specific perks to do well at red rank. It's that simple. She doesn't shut down looping. It takes time to infect people so they can be one-shotted unless you get lucky. Her lunge is bad. Tallest killer so even easier to spot her at jungle gyms. 
---
She has some plusses but again, you have to use specific perks to do well. Thana+Dying Light+Corrupt Intervention is pretty damn good. But, that leaves only one perk slot left to play with.

Oh what a surprise! I was on your stream yesterday and now I see your post
---
Yeah, the games almost pass too fast to fool around and really be a ghost face, but when you can do so its the greatest fun in the game
---
You hear one of your friend miss a skill check and then all of a sudden your gen is now on fire
---
Freddy too. He can handle SWF. Maybe Billy depending on the map.
---
Everyone dipping when he uncloaks is the best part
---
Trade spine chill for premonition and thats me lol
---
* groovy music stops*
---
Making me go for the hooked person is not countering me. It is not tunneling if the dummy thinks I won't hit him cuz he is freshly unhooked.
---
Ah dude don't worry. I am very not good about 75% of the time, but I feel super good about myself during the other quarter.
---
I get nervous around obvious swf groups and those ranked at least a color down (up?) from me, but really, the only way to be more confident is to just do the thing.
---
Also, dont hoard offerings. Offer that 100% objective like you were a pro. The worst that happens is that you die immediately, and so what, there's another round a few clicks away.
---
Red mori just shouldn't exist. Or, at least it should trigger after the *second* hook, but right now it's game-breakingly OP. Like, if it were a perk, it would get run every game until it got nerfed to a green mori, or flat-out deleted.
---
This is oddly specific...
---
Do you need to talk, OP?
---
Pretty sure its much easier on pc, try playing kyf first to test the waters i guess
---
that's different from the term tunneling. Even then, due to the perks we have in game, especially due to the meta right now, the person you just hooked isn't the best choice, especially if they have BT or DS activate due to it.
---
NOED isn't exactly equivalent to that due to when it activates and the boosts it actually gives.
---
It's awful right now. Doing things like announcing your nerfing insta heals leads to hugely increased usage. Every match has generally a couple of them. Combined with rank reset and it's painful to play. Can tell when killer queues are instant that people aren't having fun dealing with this shit.
---
I don't know for me wifi is the internet box, call me a dumbass but it's how it is for me dammit

Just upload a video of you getting a fast 4k against shitty survivors. You don’t need to be a cocky bragger

Obviously killers can slug to counter DS, but i still find it so frustrating that everytime I run DS I get slugged, but when I decide to run something else suddenly they never slug me.
---
Thats a baby myers the reason he lost you so quick
---
I know I can just close chat but I feel like its vital for learning from mistakes (and making possible friends, who knows?) It's the mistakes I'm scared of, ya know? I guess it's just kinda intimidating. Thanks for the advice!
---
Yeah but killers get some bp atleast in games like these you get like 3k as a surv max. Lol and the killer gets all the choices. They can choose to farm, they can slaughter us, they can half way farm half way not farm, they can not super tryhard but still try. Like they get options. From the survivors point of view you just accept what happens and you get no choice and most of the time they just smash you down in 2 seconds.
---
Dwight is truly the best. ❤️
---
The reason why I said you were coming at me with ferocity was because you turned the civil conversation to a personal attack against me with passive aggresive statements regarding my skill level and such. In regards to your other statement, it makes no sense to the conversation because we were just talking about the amount of fun it is when playing low tier killers at high ranks.

I HAD BEEN PLAYING CLOWN FOR HOURS ON RANK RESET TO GET THE ADEPT ACHIEVEMENT, I ENDED UP GETTING A 3 GEN ON LERYS WHERE ALL GENS WERE RIGHT BESIDE EACHOTHER. 2 SURVIVORS LEFT, ALL I NEEDED TO DO TO GET MY ACHIEVEMENT IS HOOK AND KILL THEM. NO GEN PROGRESS.  
---
THE FUCKING STEVE DC'D SO THE NEA COULD GET THE HATCH. THEY DIDNT EVEN LET ME HOOK THEM, THEY JUST LEFT. 
---
F U C K Y O U STEVE AND NEA. THAT WAS HOURS OF CONSTANT PAIN TO GET THAT STUPID ACHIEVEMENT WASTED. I WAS SO PISSED I JUST GAVE UP AND WENT BACK TO GHOSTFACE
---
Needs to be buffed to give all teammates around you endurance so it can counter perks like NOED. This forces the killer to kill you instead, but you know he won't leave the Nea who looped him the entire game run free.
---
I think keys have a 30 second time limit before the hatch closes itself
---
Purple Key leaves it open for 5s. Pink Key leaves it open for 30s. 
---
Add-ons add more time to this.
---
I'm gonna need two bolters for this heresy

You might get salty downvotes from killer mains who genuinely think only Survivors are toxic, but you are doing the Lord’s work!

I died after I figured out what you ment

Just buy a cat 5 cable and plug it into your modem directly and the other end into your pc.

Wifi is only good for browsing the internet and porn. If you're trying to game through wifi you're going to have a really bad time. Use a direct connection and you'll have a far better experience playing online games.

This is really well drawn and I really like it, But as many other have said it doesn't fit her character.

But still, Damn this is good.

Just thought it was funny I ended a game in a minute as bubba, that's all, no need to be rude.

FYI killers can't see what level your survivor is, only your other survivors
---
Thank you! It was a fun doodle idea.

You look more like a cultist mage than Amanda.

It's mostly the robe though.

I always run Franklin's for that very reason, really wipes the smile off the faces of a cocky survivor with an insta heal.
---
yes but no emotes that's gay
---
This is good. Good job.
---
Ideas along those lines that I have seen is location based voice chat. Basically, you can talk to the people near you, the louder you are, the more your voice projects, but you run the risk of the killer hearing (stealth killers like Wraith, Pig and Ghostface would be great for this) and countering whatever plan you come up with.

You don't ever get to see it unless you're the survivor. Otherwise if you need to know that badly, I suppose you can set a timer on your phone and set it to count down the second a gen is completed. The timer is 2 minutes and 30 seconds without tampered and only 2 minutes flat with tampered.
---
Thank you 💌
---
So you can with an extra third party insert?
---
starts with a free mori
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah your right about that.
---
Yea but I think the secondary attacks are categorized as special attacks
---
Nice. I dig it
---
hopper... oh god... I still cry god dammit, his letter was so beautiful...
---
Yeah :)
---
I run across the map at the start with chainsaw and insta down and hook and get called a hacker and racial slurs, but if I miss and hit a haybale and get blinded I get called a noob.
---
I'm not trying to be that guy, but... man, you paid good money for this opportunity. All the time you spent studying, working your butt off, and working towards your future...so, anyways, wanna party up? I'm on PC lol
---
My need to wazzup is intensifying
---
Don’t think The Entity allows weapons, there’s tons of cosmetics with empty holsters and Ash’s lore mentions him waking up without his boomstick
---
Bubba op af, plz nerf
---
When I started playing, I took Bill cuz I was a big L4D fan and Borrowed Time was broken good at the time (it worked on both the unhooked and unhooker, so farming someone mid-chase was just straight up the right play to save yourself)
---
I always ran plunderers and did what I could to bring out the rarest item possible. Now I have like 80 engineer's toolboxes even tho I haven't played Bill in ages.
---
I was so proud when I ended up cleaning my entire offerings tab when filling my entire item inventory
---
That scoops ahoy costume...legend.
---
I play killer and survivor and yeah if you slip a bit as killer then the survivors rage, but the killers control the game. I get killers all the time that camp and tunnel. In fact for a whole week before rank reset, every killer I went against camped, at rank 4. I’m just annoyed that killers are always buffed and survivors are always nerfed. BVHR needs to do a big rework. Overall I think BVHR doesn’t understand the concept of indirect buffing and nerfing.
---
r/perfectlycutscreams potential
---
Yeah, especially with killers. The powers are so unique, you gotta try them all.
---
Don't forget an alcoholic.
---
Killers are host, but you still need to connect with them, which means you need your connection to travel trough various connection points before getting to the killer.
---
Your internet may not matter if the connection point 2 jumps over is having issues because of a storm or some such.
---
So if it's just you having issues, it's probably you.
---
Ruin is mandatory. Without it survivor will gen rush in zero time.

---
Legit just finished season 3 last night. Sat alone in my dark room crying for 15 minutes all in my feels :'(
---
That’s weird...I’ve never seen that before. But yes, you do lose all of your items when you prestige
---
You don't mind a surv for their perks.
---
You want to lvl everyone with the perks you want to 40, then lvl your main (that you choose basing on looks, who the character is or overall who you like the most design-wise) to get said perks on tier 3. Then you want to level other survivors to unlock new perks and then unlock said perks on your main
---
repeat until you have all of them
---
No, if you dc you lose blood points gained during the match, you lose a pip or two and your daily won’t count. She was probably just using it as an excuse.
---
You seem insecure as fuck lol
---
I read it multiple times and now i have to ask. What means 4k?
---
The only way you can get it is by changing your App Store region to Norway or someplace where it’s already released.
---
I’m a Dwight
---
I thought so
---
Thanks
---
well it would close that loop because its only 1 way
---
No problem!
---
Has a Spine Chill Premonition combo
---
Still sticks to the gen even tho you see the killer looking at you, know where they are, hear the terror radius getting more intense and see them coming
---
That's some balls or stupidity
---
Luckily the killer wasn't smart either
---
Kate gets to keep her ice axe pick things. Don’t tell me you couldn’t brain someone with those.
---
I try to not listen about legion being weak because it makes me sad
---
I can't relate to this due to only playing killer. Are there really that many Spirit players?
---
You have no idea how difficult things can get for the killer some times.
---
&gt;!He isn’t dead!&lt;
---
Surviver dansing in the exit gate would make me cry
---
Don’t be mean to Maurice
---
plunderers and coin add ons; its a lucrative business model
---
Lawl
---
Really?
---
I was in Bricky’s Legion case file, it was crazy seeing how stupid I played lol
---
But you can see the ping before the match starts?
---
let me loop the huntress to a dead zone.
---
If they do it, it'll become a s tier mori
---
What if the trapper dropped a trap on your noggin? That would be sick
---
Thank you! That artists Twitter is full of some amazing things!
---
Definitely. But that wouldn't make it the goriest mori would it? What is the goriest mori?
---
Screw emotes fix bugs, and hitboxes, and make bubba run at 30 mph
---
*meep*
---
no i was talking about losing progress after being banner for dcing
---
I think they should add new game modes something along the lines of 2v8 or 2v6 or hide and seek or some shit
---
I disagree I think red moris should stay. They are more of a fun item in my opinion. The killer gets to have a more relaxed match and only really needs 4 hooks and survivors are faced with more of a challenge and also if they die it's at least to a cool animation other than a hook death. Also if you lose a pip then it's not very hard it earn one back.
---
Aw hell yeah a man of class
---
It’s PS4 messages so after the match i knew his name so I messaged him to say thanks
---
On PC? Yes, we're on dedicated servers.
---
Haha...it’s becoming my entire channel....whoops...
---
This is amazing
---
That first frame with the tongue has me dying lol
---
You going to Grandma's to put an RBT on her?
---
I wrote when the door is open and I thought it’d be too lengthy if I added “and then the killer hooks someone” I just left it as implied
---
and this kids is why we don't cleanse. Good job though!
---
Sorry to disappoint, but it's really just a fortune I've been meaning to put in my wallet.
---
I dare you to try to do a match without completing it
---
Been to red ranks, can confirm. It's where the tryhardiest of tryhards gather and stay until the next rank reset, after which they stomp a couple newbie pubs and get back to red ranks instantly.
---
But I promised myself I'd stop... after just one last match. So...message me your Steam ID? aha
---
Yeah sometimes randoms are kinda sucky but sometimes they kill themselves so you can get hatch. It’s the joys of playing with randoms I guess
---
Let me ask, why would you stay and finish it now?
---
It takes the killer more to kick it down than you to stop it from regressing.
---
You're in the shack, so you could just vault the window. After the killer kicks the gen, they can either leave (you get to finish the gen) or chase you. If they chase you, you go around the shack and gently tap it to stop it from regressing. 
---
If they keep kicking it, they won't even catch you.
---
If they leave it be, this gen won't regress. It's also the first gen, it's not like you are in a rush to get adrenaline going.
---
If the killer was smart, he would've charged his chainsaw slightly and kept it there, baiting you into finishing the gen and then canceled it to grab you off OR straight up chainsawed you. You only got away with your misplay because the killer misplayed.
---
I would appreciate a throat-slit emote that works on everyone except Demogorgon. On Demogorgon it just makes you do the scream from the trailer.
---
Keys have time limits. When you're the last survivor the hatch will stay open til the killer closes it, starting End Game Collapse if it hasnt already begun
---
30 for a skeleton key and 10 for a full key
---
You put some dirt in his eye
---
How i am supposed to read the perks? Make the words bigger
---
Challenge accepted
---
Bruh. I know how Legion works. I play them a lot as well
---
They still are low tier no matter how you put it.
---
I'm also quite sure bamboozle hurts you more than it helps.
---
The most important thing when playing Killer is learning how to end chases effectively. The best way to end chases quickly is to mind-game, especially around LoS blockers and windows. By blocking windows you're robbing yourself of the mind-game potential.
---
Bamboozle
---
Ah, I forgot you can only play with top tier perks and if you use any other perk, you’re brainless.
---
Oh frick this works in two different ways, one, the outfit and two, it's the office which includes \*cough\* Dwight, that means that Dead By Daylight and The Office are connected with Jim being the next killer with his abilities just being different ways to prank the survivors
---
Can't hide as Jane, the clap of your ass cheeks will alert the killer
---
Holy minecraft
---
I dont understand what you're saying at all
---
Ok, this template is on fire now. Lol
---
Honestly same
---
r/oddlyspecific
---
You should really play the other side before you make such insanely false statements. Killers have perks like the ones you mentioned because it's a 4v1. Killers have to juggle 4 people. If chase's dont end quickly, survivors start getting gens done fast. If you're having this much trouble with dealing with killers, I'd suggest you look at guides to improve. Skilled survivors typically have an advantage.
---
I'm just asking "why would one risk a 90% chance of getting easily downed with no pay-off just to have a 10% chance to finish a gen they don't need done AND waste a god pallet?"
---
damn you right lemme p3 real quick
---
Because she’s a mothafuckin G
---
I can watch that on repeat
---
I unironically thought it was a killer ad on when I first saw it.
---
I just unlocked spirit fury the other day too. 
---
Oh well. I'll take the extra BP
---
Gamer time *dab emoji*
---
Ooo I do this when I’m bored and want to de pip
---
I think ebony moris should be an expired offering since they are unfair and not that hard to get but the other two mori offerings are fair enough since they don't turn the whole game to the killer's advantage. Instaheals aren't quite up to par with an ebony but keys are and should be reworked as well.
---
Honestly, it's for this very reason that even though I don't run NOED I don't want to see it nerfed. I have had too many games recently where survivors can't even be bothered to leave gens to cleanse Ruin, let alone dulls. 
---
I'm not advocating a buff for NOED, but I would like to see more perks that encourage survivors to actually interact with the game instead of just switching between hide and go seek and holding M1
---
A lot of people are missing that this killer let the survivor escape on purpose. He was waiting by the door for the survivor to wiggle off. Had he wanted the kill he would have hooked the survivor, or had he wanted the entity end game kill he would have just dropped the survivor. This was clearly a case of the killer already having won and letting the survivor get escape blood points. Nice guy killer.
---
They should add this to the game
---
It's not even about how effective BBQ is as a perk and it's usefulness, it's just about the pure BP gain. Without BBQ it feels abysmally slow.
---
I'm a killer main so I do have all my killers leveled to at _least_ 40 and all the teachables unlocked, but not all the perks on killers. Not to mention I want to level up my survivors as well but playing killer w/ BBQ is the fastest way to get BP
---
Thats more of a splooge
---
Well you know my POV on this
---
That's interesting, i find the Nurse one of the easier killers to use.
---
XD is that a blanket as your cape lol? thats great.
---
As soon as the match started it was laggy. It just wasn't that bad or so I thought.
---
How is Billy not a whoosh?
---
Ha ha this is about as likely as a trapper rework
---
It's worse when the next killer you face isn't a spirit
---
"gg ez"
---
Nurse is ez mode
---
Maybe it’s a console thing, unless you play on console and different killers pose different challenges to different people. I struggle with here nonstop so I stray away, save me and 4 other people a dc due to my lack of knowledge.
---
I wonder why
---
Yep that’s why I said if you have most killers and perks. If you don’t, BBQ is amazing to level up all your characters because of the extra BP.
---
I don't know...
---
Tried some match without ruin and they rushed me very fast. I did all I could to counter them but it's quite difficult, in particular against SWF
---
As someone who's been watching tru3 for a while,  he's not really worth it watching anymore. If a build doesn't have ruin, watch him mention it a lot and whine. He's probrably only streamer i have seen actually complain going against good survivors then proceeds to say survivors are way too powerful. Its like in a tennis match you complaining the other one is skilled lol. You can give him a build and he wont try it to getting to work. Then if he's losing he will blame it on anything. Map survivors build. He has always an excuse. Otz is where its at and so many other people are more fun to watch. I think dbd just brings out the worse on him. He should go play some other games rather than dbd 24/7 (during streams)
---
A 105 speed survivor would never get caught if they are remotely decent
---
Lol so true
---
I do both console &amp; desktop (mainly console), but hey i guess certain things are easier for certain people and not others. What killer do you main or do best at?.
---
That first steve... where the fuck were you going my guy? seriously lol.  
---
"Uh oh leatherface, the killer inrivaled in clear open spaces, oh shit theres a clear open spaces! lets go baby!"
---
You mean dlc? 
---
I came back after a long break myself, and really enjoying the spirit pack, and the saw pack. The killers have some interesting approaches.
---
wtf
---
The plague perk that blocks gens furthest away from you
---
I usually leave OOO alone, I even let some escape if they are doing adept
---
as soon as possible
---
If it's a 4 man SWF and one person has OoO, you're never going to find the other 3.
---
4 kills
---
Haunted Grounds got a new feature I guess..? After a DC you can hear the survivor crying in pain at the spot they died until the totem is cleansed? Honestly that would drive me nuts because I’d have spent 20 minutes looking for the Steve. Did it ever go away?
---
I'll just stand in a corner and turn my m1 off to top it off.
---
General Reposti!
---
Personally I always advise new killers to level a 115 killer to learn the basics.
---
There has been a glitch causing an unintentional DC from a player. Might be that
---
Was jusr playing her. She needs a console rework sooooo bad. At least a slight speed boost.
---
I would love to see a single-player survival horror game featuring the DBD killers.
---
Hag is good for ruin, spirit is good for spirit fury. If you play a lot you will notice that the add-ons are pure luck and sometimes you get a lot of good add-ons while other times you get decent or stuff you don't need. Ruin is pretty escential though.
---
What’s a 115 killer
---
Imagine, the game has the feel of the new Blair Witch game but is set in Cabin in The Wood, and features the whole roster of DBD killers you have to get through.
---
Can anyone translate?
---
Better graphics honestly.
---
i mark the current gen i am working on so survivors see and help out
---
I’m trying out ghost face currently but I main spirit.
---
Freddy got REWORKEd! Try him out.
---
Maybe something episodic (a la Telltale Walking Dead, or Sally Face) where each episode is centered around each killer
---
You shouldnt Pip after barely getting one kill
---
I often make my way to red ranks but my looping skills suck ass, I just make a lot of points anyway. But apart from me when I playing in red ranks as killer I still meet players with huge variety of skill, some of them can't loop for life while sometimes I meet teams in which everybody can loop me for days
---
Well the mobile game isn’t officialy released jet. So like nobody knows this game exists on mobile unless you follow the Dead By Daylight reddit or websites. 
---
I’m sure when they release it for all countries, it will be better.
---
I feel really bad when all I see is one set of track marks leading away and I can’t find the person who saved. I’m not just gonna give away all of my pressure in one instant. I feel bad but sometimes I just gotta down the dude off of hook
---
OR: I HAVE KINDRED, WHY THE FUCK IS NONE OF YOU GOING TO SAVE ME???? THE KILLER IS NOT CAMPING!
---
Oh my god, Feng Min/Doctors episode would be the BEST
---
Thanks u/Your_Favorite_Porn , Nurse's power and her outfits attracted my eyes when I first playing dbd in 2017. She looks so elegant in wedding outfit.😘
---
I literally don’t know what pip means, just started playing a few months ago.
---
Mission accomplished, played as meg instead.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
My life for the Huntress chapter
---
115% movement speed which is what is most common among killers as well as a 32 meter terror radius
---
God spare us please
---
THIS  
---
EARN YOUR CLEANSE! DO AT LEAST A GEN FIRST OR WHATEVER
---
Bruh I don’t even get a muck up day
---
You got downed just as you finished the gen and adrenaline from you finishing the gen picked you up.
---
It's like the syringe-tech, but even more impressive.
---
I do alright with Ghostface, but i absolutely suck as Spirit lol.
---
Nurse
---
It's infinitely better than playing against a huntress with a minigun, which is essentially what plague is with corrupt purge. I can loop a m1 killer while being injured, everyone can. I can't loop a plague with corrupt.
---
Nope
---
I didn't expect to see a konosuba meme on r/deadbydaylight
---
The wraiths mori is hilarious to me
---
No. Just no
---
Most annoying killer to play will always be Billy, you can't change my mind
---
Imagine a ghost face doing the wave he did in his reveal trailer. I want that
---
I reccomend leveling Leatherface to get BBQ+Chili, then Hag to get Hex:Ruin. After that, try out different killers. I do like to run Pig's Perk Surveillance and the generic Whispers.
---
I played a game couple of games with Plague last night and I was honestly stunned by the fact that not a single survivor I faced seemed to remember how to play against pukey girl. Some of the easiest killer games I've ever had
---
Tbh I’d level hag first for ruin. Perk is good on most killers as it slows down the early game (unless they find the totem quickly)
---
happened to me yesterday as a killer though... I knew it, the hooked one knew it (cuz well... unfortunately the hatch was right next to the hook. oops)... and I actually thought, the other guy was at a gen and would go for a save since the surv was on his first hook. welp, looking for the guy on the other end of the map was a stupid idea. the hooked one let himself die so the other could get the hatch :'(  
---
when I realised I phase walked the shit out of my Spirit but I was too late
---
Yeah you right
---
Agreed with everything posted. And they should also add wayyy more dark fog. A new killer, Jack The Ripper would be a killer who could utilize that perfectly. Imagine fog completely surrounds a new Victorian map with only lamp posts as vision. And through the darkness, instead of the killer's heartbeat, you hear the sounds of Jack the Ripper's lumbering footsteps you hear in movies, etc. Running away, you begin navigating through the fog and darkness, but still hearing Jack's footsteps behind you catching up. Now that would bring horror back into DBD.  Thanks for reading my idea :)
---
I’ve only played against 1 hag in like a month, the majority of the killers I go against are like demo and doc or cannibal.
---
very yes
---
Iron will is a very strong perk, it is EXCELLENT vs nurse and spirit. Most experienced killers can track you without a visual.
---
As someone who plays m1 killers frequently I must say it can be very disorienting not hearing constant whining.
---
Unfortunately it is hard countered by Stridor which a lot of Spirits have started running.
---
There is no perfec...Nevermind
---
You look stunning, you may gut whatever you want 😳
---
Same here, Doctor's gotta the most annoying.
---
To be fair, if we had OG, Freddy, something like this could be done as a cosmetic for him.
---
It's not the same but hey...
---
I believe what he was trying to do was time the exit to give you hope of escape, before having that escape snatched by the entity mm away from the exit
---
So not nice, but still kinda nice to give him a chance at all
---
This was a goddamn awesome idea
---
Wow, thank you. That makes me happy that maybe one day, the devs might dabble in some Lovecraft mythos. I guess Herbert West as a survivor is still a big want for me :)
---
r/curseddeadbydaylight

top tier shitpost
---
Billy is a solid nyooom.
---
Dailies
---
This is from The Office. Plays DBD &amp; knows The Office. Marry me?
---
What about 17 current killers?
---
To make DbD a horror game, different to what it currently is, get a new engine and make a new game.
---
i jave 24 medkits and 30 Flashlights 12 red keys. I NEED MORE.
---
Entity jizz
---
Can't say I'd like to see you in my lobbies.
---
Any killer can do it. But for other kills walk over on top of the hay THEN lunge attack. You can't make the entire distance in one lunge, but you can cover the first half just by walking over
---
Myers already has no red stain in T1 and his Terror Radius going from 8 to 4 meters doesn't change anything when you could use M&amp;A
---
Not that bad of a match, He got some decent downs, i was the only one resisting him, and the Meg disconnected early match. If he didnt dc he would've probably got me and only Claudette wouldve survive
---
A howling chainsaw isn't really a whoosh lol
---
This is a well known Nurse trick that I myself use to make the lunge go further
---
It just works trust me
---
oh that's hot
---
Well I can't help any of them, sadly. This is my way of bringing intense fear with my dream chapter. :)
---
Bull-fockin'-shieeet. My brother is maining a Nurse on his PS4 Pro. Literally can't stop blinking at the EXACT locations of the Survivors. It is not about a platform, it's about having a head on your shoulders.
---
Oh damn lmfaooo
---
I'm just about to buy it right now! They're called
---
Experimental measures for the head
---
Dr. Vivisection for the body
---
Surgeon buddy for his weapon
---
But she blind him and run away in endless bush limbo till the hatch spawns
---
Being destroyed by Monto and seeing people in the comments like "omg these survivors are so trash"
---
Unlucker dog. Unlucker
---
He would have broken the tier list, too kinky for the other killers to even compete with.
---
Bold of you to assume I have a boyfriend
---
they need to make money though - and even though going over the game, rebalancing things, sprucing things up etc is something they might want to do - they have to answer to their owners and work to a budget, they need to release new content they can monetise. That said, this game is massively under monetised imo
---
I managed to get to rank 6. For some reason now that I’m back at rank 14 after the reset I’m having a MUCH harder time
---
But that's a risk I'm willing to take 😂 or something like that 😅
---
Exactly. If it was me I'd be pretty pissed that everyone was congratulating this guy on cleverly beating some n00b when I was clearly letting him go.
---
CI is agood perk but i wish it worked the same way as the equivalent survivor perk that it would block 3 gens that a re the closest to each other than the current version that blocks 3 gens that are the farthest from you when the trial starts
---
I might make this a meme, I'll give cred tho
---
lol Fair enough. I was focused on him flying across the map.
---
I wanna thank you personally for sharing this absolute gem with me.
---
I am now horny. 
---
I love you.
---
Lol shut up you circle jerker. The amount of killers that DC because of ruin going early is insane
---
I think a Werwolf would be great. He could sprint with his 4 legs like a real Wolf and Jump over windows and maybe even pallets for a short time
---
Idk why every ghost face I play against is toxic as hell
---
&gt; In regards to your other statement, it makes no sense to the conversation because we were just talking about the amount of fun it is when playing low tier killers at high ranks.
---
This is a thread about daily rituals. You were complaining about only getting daily rituals for low-tier killers while you are at a high killer rank. I (apparently mistakenly) assumed you were upset at not getting the bloodpoints, because why would you be complaining about anything else? Bloodpoints are the only reward for completing rituals. If it's just about the fun of playing a specific killer, then why are did you bring this up in response to a post about rituals? If you want to play a specific killer for the fun of it then there's nothing stopping you. You don't need a ritual to do that, you can just do it.
---
[deleted]
---
I HAVENT PLAYED A DAY SINCE RANK RESET WITHOUT RAGING BECAUSE I’M LEFT ON FIRST HOOK OR I’M TUNNELED TO DEATH FOR EXISTING EVEN WITH TEAMMATES TRYING TO PULL THE KILLER AWAY
---
u/SameAsGrybe
---
We stan scoops ahoy and the rainbow flag 😂🌈
---
I like this, great job
---
But i must ask, whats your favourite scary movie?
---
I'd stab
---
I've long thought this should be the case, but maybe add a blood-point bonus similar to BBQ&amp;C. So for each person you Mori after 2 hooks you get a 25% stack to your final blood-point amount. This would make it worth using.
---
literally anything the survivor you're playing against doesnt like
---
Wasn’t farming. Game took like 25 minutes because the survivors were just crouching around and sitting in lockers on coldwind.. they were looking for the hatch when there was only 2 gens completed and they were 2 survivors alive. Which means hatch hasn’t spawned yet 😂
---
***YAS! BITCH! WERK!***
---
Awesome style
---
Yeah he let the guy escape I dont see how its toxic at all. Killer was just having a little fun.
---
No he didn't. That's why he let him wiggle off.
---
This just sounds like old legion nerfed the main problem I see is his power can not do squat for downing survivors fast but all the other 110% killers can *u can argue hag is the real odd one out here but huntress and spirit show what I mean*
---
I don’t even like him. It’s just kinda hypocritical to call out someone for something that literally everyone else does.
---
But you know, you can keep busy obsessing about other people’s lives.
---
What a dumb ass response "oh its a thing so its okay" I watched the clip and the survivors weren't toxic or salty, he lies in all of his videos he's just as pathetic as Ochido
---
i just want a meg cosmetic that isn't sport related.  
---
we get it. she likes sports.
---
You can get to rank 1 without ruin, the big problem is..you will have to sweat so damn hard. That is the big issue with playing killer, sure it's fun, until you get survivors that know how to play good.
---
So it's more like..Ruin is mandatory to not lose your sanity
---
Cool however a smart option while cashing would be turn around do the scream thing gain 5% speed and 120% isn't something to scuff at
---
Ok dude
---
Poor demogorgon, seeing as this is on console he was probably getting horrible lag to be missing so many hits
---
Well at least u didn't say ur learning nurse first bc that would have just cucked u in the future
---
Because it's a hole in the wall
---
Ahaha I thought exactly the same sentence :D
---
Simply stating the fact that YouTubers use clickbait means this individual dick riding? I sense oppositional bias.
---
Wym it's not a horror game already? Play nurse for like 200+ hours until u forgot what a pallet is and then see how scared u get when one is tossed on ur face shit makes me jump
---
That’s exactly what it is. OP should just move on
---
Nothing you said added anything to the thread
---
Iridescent button
---
Ruin isn't played nearly as much at high ranks in my experience...
---
Y A S
---
He's a prick tbh and I really don't understand why anyone would willingly watch such a depressing, moody and whingy man for hours on end. If you wanna get better at the game there's COUNTLESS other streamers out there who aren't complete and utter mood-suckers, and also better at the game to boot.
---
Get good
---
Too late to make major gameplay changes. You're better off making a new game at this point, so you don't take it away from those who like it. 
---
We could use some better graphics and maybe a gore dlc that would make it so, for example, Demo eats the head and Hag leaves the body open after a mori, without getting the game banned in some regions (would just not sell the cosmetic dlc there)
---
Probably because you're to slow to see what the point was.
---
He just spanks your ass.
---
Agree on the sanity thing. Totally. 
---
If you find good SWF teams, every match can be an hell and, in the end, result in an entity displeasement.
---
This sub is riddled in tru3 fanboys btw. A lot of whiny killer mains love him because he says the things that they love hearing. Expect to see them in this thread
---
Live or die? I think I’ve made my choice uwu
---
Lol is tru3 paying you to defend him this hard? Pathetic
---
Sorry about the grammar if there is any
---
Well Pewdiepie makes every one of his video titles click bait. Why don’t we just go in a Lynch and fuck him and all the other ones up? Or is their just something against Tru that you don’t like? Tell me, cause I am trying not to pick sides here.

Some more pics!
---
Ur right but i personally think it hasn't much personality. It might not be the worst, but not the best mori
---
its potentially still kind of a BM, not toxic though. I was watching one of Bricky's videos and its always fun to hear him say "let's play tik tok dwight"
---
Can somebody explain me why all japanese characters dress like they are transvestite? No offence, you do what you do but just curious about the trend. 
---
Sorry if I displeased anyone.
---
I wonder about the animation time on the ability. You can currently look away from the survivor you're chasing and use it to make sure you won't hit anyone to get a free speed boost mid-chase.
---
Animation time will determine if it's worth using that way.
---
The power isn't very good. If the use listed above proves non-beneficial, it's good only for tracking, making you a worse Doctor. I'd reduce the terror radius to 24m to compensate.
---
Are the survivors able to hear the ping? Do they know that you know their location? 
---
If yes, it could also have a build-in Hag's **Disfigured Ear** add-on, deafening the survivors for 5 seconds.
---
**From Beyond**'s effect exists in the game. **Surveillance** has it
---
**Extraterrestial Instincts** sounds fun, but I think it shouldn't be a hex perk. **Tinkerer** activates 5 times per match with no cooldown without letting the survivors know you have it.
---
**Abduction** makes no sense. "While in chase do something for 15 seconds."
---
Either "While in chase" and lasts until not, or "At the start" and lasts 15 seconds.
---
You can also go the survivor's **Leader, Streetwise, Vigil** perks way
---
"While chasing your obsession, other survivors within your terror radius suffer from 3/4/5% hindered status effect. This effect persists for 15 seconds after leaving your terror radius or ending the chase with the obsession"
---
Noice. Also happy cake day bro
---
I fucking love your version of The Legion,they look like a buch of memey teens,and it's beautiful!
---
Still needs a TL;DR
---
Unpopular opinion: Make Mori like they where in the beginning. No hook needed to use /s
---
Probably, but it's been shaped by lots and lots of matches where sticking around was a waste.
---
That looks amazing.
---
yeah me too but on survivor I get tunneled 70% of my games
---
I am thoroughly disappointed
---
This is such a load of shit. People play the top three killers (nurse, spirit, billy) because they want to win. They want a 4K and it’s easier with them then it is with legion, leather face and wraith. Don’t blame survivors for fuck sake, that’s so embarrassing. Once again killers MUST be seen as victims. So strange.
---
Thank you, I definitely agree! You can tell the artist put a lot of love into it, and I was happy to bring it to life with the rest of the outfit :-).
---
Taking the Selfie with the camera would have been perfect.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
still amazing job you did there.
---
ONCE AGAIN I ESCAPE WITH 4 WGLF STACKS ONLY TO NOT BENEFIT FROM THEM AT ALL. BHVR PLS FIX YESTERSAY
---
I mean, I'm pretty comfortable with god like nurse players getting a nerf. They were hardly conductive to enjoyable games.
---
Ok if you really want a TL DR. The math was checked and instead of it being 155% to 107% it’s more like 145% to 125%. But the main point is I believe DbD is removing killers competitively viability, at least tournament grade viability. Aka no add on item or perks.
---
Also while I’m at it, shout out to my wonderful Frank cosplayer boyfriend who had the patience to follow me around the woods and get some cool pictures for two hours
---
That wiggle in the early part of the race really held her back.
---
Thank you sir

Stop right there you cancerous scum! Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence, Your emojis are now forfeit!

Buff nurse. Moar woosh
---
There's a difference between not being top tier and just being straight up dogshit.
---
So you’re telling me you want the big show?
---
Np, have fun sir
---
Any links? LULW
---
🥵
---
These comments are mad, just cause he exposes how easy the game is for survivors you hate him? 
---
Its like survivor mains have no relevancy outside there rank 1 swf group.
---
the myers skin we never wanted

doing a ballet leap fabously

This comment section is so sad.

Hey if the numbers average out there’s nothing wrong right??

No, it detects the sound through your mic

And yet, every post bashing him is upvoted and the ones saying he's good/okay are being downvoted.
---
Big thonk.....
---
Killers aren’t allowed to play the game when someone burns BPS. They are mandated by survivor law to farm and let everyone escape with a nice goodbye kiss.
---
I was watching someone on YouTube, can't remember who, and they never went over to their totem in the beginning, this actually meant the survivors weren't given any clue as to where it might be, had helped me to keep my ruin up for longer
---
He is good at the game. People don't give a shit if he uses clickbait or not we watch for the content.
---
Does it tilt you if people teabag?
---
Its more like 1/4 cause of the ratio in game.
---
Does she have aim assist on console?
---
Killers don't get Ebony Moris every game?
---
I mean, they're an ultra rare offering that hardly show up on the Bloodweb, you have to stockpile them up in order to use them consistently, they punish you heavily on pipping and bloodpoints, and open up the Hatch faster if the Survivors have a key.
---
The fact that you're arguing that Killers get 4Ks every game because Ebony Moris exist (Well, you say Moris but I hope to god you're not trying to say Green/Yellow Moris are a problem) means that while my evidence may be anecdotal, yours is just in bad faith.
---
But the myers skin we deserved
---
Would be cool
---
spirit is more like hhhhhngaaaaaaaaaaaah
---
Cool, I guess?
---
Bruh
---
Holy moly, this is insanely beautiful, great job!
---
Youd be surpised how many times moris are used. I didnt say that killers get 4ks every game. I said that killers that use Moris Ivory/Ebony almost always lead to a 4k. I think a large portion of the community thinks moris are unfair so i guess a lot of people have bad faith.
---
its a delicate procedure but vital nonetheless
---
Yes hello this is amazing and I love it to death ok thanks bye
---
Where tf you get this format lol?
---
I tried... but failed...
---
Pop is a masterpiece of a perk, it works in so many ways.

thats what i said

Yeah I had to change my info to Denmark, so I’m assuming by then when the worldwide release happens, yes it should finally get dedicated servers.

Suggestion

What, I did not know you could do that

Last night about 12 o’clock

He had two sisters. He killed his older sister Judith and we didn’t find out that his younger sister Cynthia Myers is Laurie Strode until I believe the second movie? 
---
The wiki states: “Laurie Strode was born Cynthia Myers on February 22nd, 1961. She was the youngest of three children of Donald and Edith Myers. When Laurie was only two, her six-year-old brother Michael brutally murdered their older sister Judith with a butcher knife. Michael was sent away following the incident. At some point, when Laurie was very young, Edith took her to visit Michael at Smith's Grove Sanitarium but warned her to never speak of this to her father. Laurie slipped this information one day and Donald whipped her with a belt. After this, Laurie did not even dare think of Michael anymore.” Then “In 1966, her parents were killed in an automobile accident and to protect her identity, it was reported that Cynthia had died in the accident as well. In reality, Laurie went into the foster care system where she was soon adopted by the Strode family and her name legally changed to Laurie Strode. The governor of Illinois kept her records sealed so that no one would further connect Laurie Strode with her psychotic older sibling. Laurie eventually forgot about her birth family. “ 
---
The 2018 version sorta ignores but doesn’t outright retcon it. He’s obsessed with his relatives (specifically Laurie) which is what we’re lead to believe motivates his bloodlust for her. 
---
https://halloweenmovie.fandom.com/wiki/Laurie_Strode/Earth-Two
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Bubba is the most unsatisfying killer to play against, and hilariously not overthinked.. He can chainsaw all the 4 survivor with a base camp, just essencially disgusting, for my oponion even worst than a top tier spirit. We always leave the game with my friends when seeing one ass bubba xd
---
Can’t wait to pay for each new mori, and new emote.
---
Carpenter said that's not cannon. Laurie is just the babysitter. 
---
Retconning that she's his sister is lame and makes no sense when watching the original Halloween.
---
Disturbed Ward with its spawns in the middle of nothingness should have it's own 'xD' tier.
---
How dare you rip off the best killer In the game! The Legion has nothing else going for them damn just give them that W for Christ sakes!
---
Ghostface: *Stalk noises*
---
The hell?
---
Jeff is a bro
---
Don't play her right now is my best advice, she's been nerfed on the PTB and you won't be able to do the usual blink 2 times, fatigue, then blink 2 times again instantly. It might fuck up your muscle memory etc etc. Please wait for her PTB state to be live. It's for your own good.
---
Was that intentional
---
He still has one Ultra Rare slot so it's possible
---
It should just be his treatment mode passive. That should bring him up to ss tier lol.
---
This is why I play both lol
---
Yeah, I think that’s a lame decision too. It explains his obsession with her. Which is how they describe it and it connects the murder of Judith with why he’s pursuing Laurie. 
---
As much as I like the 2018 version, I don’t like that they retconned everything else that’s been established for the betterment of the lore. 
---
Idk why Carpenter would say that when he co-wrote the screenplay for both Halloween and Halloween II, where the latter established the relationship between Laurie and Michael. The 2018 film was written by new people though.
---
Maurice is scarier than any killer.
---
Change my mind
---
You mean nurse?
---
Considering how much you hate bhvr and how hostile you are towards the game and other people, please just quit playing.
---
Can I have base image please? I could make some stuff with it
---
It's all about luck, that's what Ace is about
---
Darker maps would make Blendettes op
---
90% of the time when I let a failing killer hook me, they stand there repeatedly hitting me with their weapon as I dangle. Super annoying!
---
People won't believe you, so [here's the link](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/):
---
&gt; * *Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible.*
---
&gt;
---
&gt; * *If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor's rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (eg If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)*
---
&gt; * *If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.*
---
&gt; * ***New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there's no other new players queuing.***
---
&gt; * *You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players.*
---
&gt; ***Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule.***
---
Open handed : cool idea of a perk, but it should be it's seperate thing from aura reading increase.   
---
Buckle Up : same, cool idea, but old buckle up as a concept shouldn't be removed, just buffed
---
yup, that sounds about right
---
That's amazing haha
---
"This bitch'll catch me when pigs fly hahahaha-oH FUCK!"
---
This
---
Ah ye my dude, good to see you. Pretty nuts eh 👌
---
wouldn't even get to mid-tier. Still does nothing to good players
---
***mAdE wItH mEmAtIc***
---
Lmao Legion needs a rework. A schizophrenic guy like Legion should have more a power like: can change his appearence for a short time to one of the survivors.
---
BBQ, Whispers, SB, NC  
---
The idea is to just kill everyone as fast as possible. I’ve started using it because I’m tired of having my Ruin totem get deleted instantly or negated by people who aren’t stupid and can hit skill checks. All of the perks are strong and consistent, two of which synergize. I don’t use add-ons so I won’t bother with perks that have a chance to just not have a function.  
---
Surveillance, M&amp;A, PGTW, Ruin  
---
Use gen grab add-ons and win.
---
That's a correct reasoning, but it makes your entire comment above worthless. Spend some time on killer and then share your views
---
Nope. Just a bunch of noob survivor that couldn't handle Bubba
---
Hmm...  that's an interesting way to play that if he did actually want the kill.
---
Its 3:29 A.M. i have a midterm at 8:30
---
No, he messaged me and wanted me dead. He was trying to hold me long enough for me to die by the collapse
---
Remove or cut terror radius extraordinarily, make everyone one shot down, remove scratch marks and make killer rely on blood trails and sounds only. Voila. Done.
---
It's weird to say "whether he likes it or not" when he created the characters and the story. But yeah, it became canon within the franchise but as far as carpenter's Halloween is concerned I don't consider it canon.
---
I imagine Carpenter never assumed there'd be more than one film. It's just a slasher film, none of the characters or story really has much weight, it was more about the atmosphere, suspense and terror.
---
Freddy laughs at borrowed time as do any killer with oblivious. As for DS, tunnel - slug - leave for 60 seconds proxy camping the downed survivor. Your thoughts on tunneling are wrong.
---
You puke on them to make them more visible and that’s about it
---
Oh ok
---
..ther?
---
Entity and her tricks
---
The thing is not every killer does that
---
I seriously don't know, but the intent was malicious. He wanted to hold me off the door literally
---
Thanks so much for the input :) I got so many comments with no actual input other than "NoPe"
---
Is this tumbl?
---
Correct
---
Np, people who only see it one way probably don’t play much of the other side, I play killer arms just go for the closest person to me, if that person is already hurt, just unfortunate.
---
Wow that wasn‘t hard
---
Agreed, no doubt &gt;!he is coming back!&lt;
---
Agreed
---
He actually thought I wasn't gonna have enough time. Thankfully, the slowed timer was my savior
---
why
---
I didn't farm
---
If you were decent at looping then you wouldn't have much of an issue. 
---
LF has no mobility (unlike billy) so if one person can loop him for a fair amount of time then the others can rush gens.
---
Another tip is to never go to killer shack if basement is there, because if he downs you nearby, it's GG.
---
Jake goes for the door, Jane for the pallet and the claudette for the window. It would be funny if they all went for the pallet lmao
---
Good cosplay, my dude. Happy Spooktober.
---
You guys don't memes sometimes
---
He still just boils down to being an M1 Killer who can take a light jog for a little bit. 
---
If you use Bloodhound and Sloppy, you can usually be impossible to lose in chases, as most people don’t bother to heal. Maybe Spirit Fury and Enduring to help eat pallets?
---
He even went the extra mile and ragequit before I got to the menu
---
Plague not S tier? She literally pukes on you. I'd consider that more kinky than some lil' chokeing.
---
Not after the new patch when he’s affected by Spine Chill 😉
---
Must not be using prayer beads.
---
It’s the oath one must take to become a true Ash/Steve main.
---
Exactly my thoughts. :D
---
Id just wait 15 seconds for Borrowed to end and down the survivor again.
---
I swear if I had to play one more ghost face match with a bright red teabagging pointing nea I was gonna retire the character
---
Lol happened to me after a 2 minutes chase, but the time between last gen and hit was like a piccosecond
---
NOT THE DWIGHT NOOOOOOO!
---
Dude was getting chased while exposed.
---
Stopped by to heal you.
---
Aren't you bored of this tunneling debate? Game has been out for 3 years and we are still talking about it. There are "anti-tunneling" perks and there are ways to avoid them already. 
---
You don't need to give survivors excuses if you decide to tunnel
---
You don't need to give killers excuses if you decide to run Decisive strike/Borrowed time
---
A little over 2 years maybe
---
And I got tunneled and camped because I used an "infinite" (Ironwork, with dead hard, once lol).
---
that's hot
---
Dosent Myers do that?
---
So if I see two survivors, one injured and one full health I should go chase the difficult one? Tunneling is focusing on one survivor no matter his health
---
Spirit doesn't really woosh, she just kinda rides on a vaccum cleaner
---
-You already own balanced landing
---
-Neah is at lvl.3
---
nani?
---
haven't seen this one before..
---
How do you even use it on the ps4? I have only accidently used it twice and it was at a random spot..
---
I feel  like im doing dumb decisions all the time.
---
Looking Halloween Cool!
---
The killer was trying to have him die by the endgame timer running out, not by hooking him. Op literally says this in another comment
---
People will alwys comain, if you give someone a potnof gold, some still want the fucking rainbow with it!
---
Nah it is target 1 survivor but they will be targetin them because they are injured
---
This but on a new mode.
---
You can do that without OoO
---
Now do that when he's behind the wall or two on Lery's
---
Daaaaaaamn.
---
This is probably the most impressive Ghostface cosplay I've seen. Bravo!
---
I first thought "oh its bugged"... But its actually wraithed! Xd
---
Pfft, hardly.
---
Okay but if a red rank killer doesnt get atleast a 3k they get triggered.
---
Wow if the devs see this, they gonna nerf her again, DONT SHOW IT!!
---
Meta perks
---
Me: Slippery Meat
---
Did I just see you in my window?
---
Well this was a downward spiral.
---
Bamboozled!
---
Survivor is more fun and you can also play with your friends, that's your incentive
---
*My My the tables have turned the turns have tabled*
---
It’s so strong because you can see stealth killers
---
Yeah that's not going to happen. More people just care about the win and about screwing the other side than literally anything else. If the game wants to clear up the toxicity then moderate the chats and permaban and BP reset anyone who vocalizes being a dick.
---
The issue with that, is if you are running it, you are good at looping as you said, of they target you, majority of the game will already be over by the time you get them.
---
I only like Third Seal
---
I had the same playing as Legion in low ranks with BBQ and Whispers. Those newbies lol
---
Ranks are kind of meaningless in this game since you can get carried to rank 1 by perks. A crappy survivor with Dead Hard, DS, Adrenaline, and BT will always do better than a crappy survivor without those perks.
---
Not saying that it doesn't take skill to consistently be Red Ranks. There's definitely something to be said about Survivors/Killers who are just flat out better than other players who can run circles around pretty much everyone. But you absolutely can be carried to red ranks via perks.
---
It annoys me how he talks like he’s the only killer that goes against sweaty survivors
---
He’s not wrong though lol
---
I’m not even a killer “main” , but most of the time he’s pretty spot on with his criticism of the game...
---
Btw, he also plays survivor as well and talks about things there as well... not just killer, but sure...
---
What does the offering do?
---
You want some real facts? If you use the word "mains" you are normie
---
Just waiting on my permaban now
---
don't know why you got downvoted (don't worry buddy, got your back) but DCers are cunts. You either play a game or you don't, don't DC because it didn't go your way.
---
Okay, dude.
---
How was he supposed to know be was vs a huntress and a bad one? You monkey
---
That's why we need perks that help the Killer out against the Obsession.
---
Bonus bloodlust, a spirit fury/Enduring combo that only works on the Obsession in a single perk, stuff like that. The Obsession should be terrified of the Killer if they don't know what they have.
---
Gotta use that new mask coming out
---
Not as impressive because ps4 but still pretty good, well your deadhard was good!
---
I personally watch many streamers and youtubers such as him, Scott, Otz, Monto, Puppers, Noob3, Pug, Hexy, Panda etc. because I love this game and if I am not able to play it at that moment, I try to watch one of them. Not all the time or all the streams, but as much as I can. Each and every single one of them have different style. I prefer variety so I watch Tru3 one day and Puppers next day for example. But if you don't like ones style, no one forces you to watch him. Just unfollow and find someone else you might like. Or even play more if you can.
---
Also when it comes to Youtube everyone clickbaits to manipulate the algorithm in a way. I didn't watch this video or the stream itself, but what if he called regular survivor toxic just to clikbaits. If you think he is a fraud and liar because he clikbaited one video (he can clickbait all of his videos, that is his content), just don't follow or subscribe to him and move on. I know this seems like I'm defending him, but I am not. This arguement is completely stupid and pointless, because everyone has their own preferences, and because yours are different from his, that doesn't make one side wrong and one side right.
---
I guess I should mention this; everyone else was already dead except for one person and then he got hatch afterwards
---
Not only that, but you can also completely destroy Trapper by knowing exactly where traps are.
---
Also, they've already said they're giving Stealth Killers Undetectable, so that won't be an issue later.
---
What‘s a dedicated server and how can I turn it off? Seems like this is the problem.
---
Because it looks epic
---
My friend goes insane and blames the game when he misses it, i laugh every time lol
---
Yeah, I know what I did was an asshole move, but that game had no chance of winning anyways. Everyone was death hook and one gen was done
---
It has a name?
---
I wouldn't really want another band aid fix through a perk, if anything it should just be general adjustments to the obsession, I think the perks are fine as is, with the exception of OoO, which is just miserable
---
Damn idk.
---
Any ideas?
---
Petition to grow up, nobody cares, how about that
---
"Hello Nurse"
---
Makes the map borderline black
---
Because he’s a console player and clearly at shit ranks. He literally just walked into the killer not even a 360 and she missed. That’s a bad player not just bad huntress you degenerate scum.
---
UwU
---
Wouldnt that be funny lol
---
Yeah but they said that about omega blink for 3 years, so like we could be waiting ages meanwhile DEMOGORGON can’t be seen by OoO after transversing and he’s real stealthy
---
This reply makes no sense. It's like saying "a sniper rifle in a shooter requires no skill cuz it gives you 20 SMG shots worth of damage per bullet"
---
it gives you information as long as you know how to use it, thus requires some skill. Being able to tell others where exactly the killer is, even tho you only see their aura and have to judge their position by using perspective and your own knowledge of the map, and to do that when it's actually valuable and not all the time when nobody cares, is a skill and you can't deny it.
---
Had the same thought first time I played against legion after being away from the game for a long time. But then I can read and it became clear.
---
Playing jumpcare myres is very fun

The next PTB patch that goes live in 5 days. Please, read its patchnotes.
---
The people who dc the most exhibit a lot of childish behavior typically, and it's usually those people who rage downvote me wile they have a tantrum instead of using their heads. (Much appreciated btw :P ty)
---
He just got NO-ed
---
How bout wait until it's on live.
---
I think what he's saying is, in an swf group with one OoO, more or less gives them all OoO for free, as the person with the perk can communicate the killers locations over mic, which doesn't take much skills besides "I see him, here is his location"
---
"I see him, here near, far, blank location, near blank object, by blank player" sure in some situations it may take some skill but not much
---
Is this offering not avaipable anymore?
---
Perk meta for each character is kinda interesting to me, and how you can sort of play around it. It's certainly a mindgame on killers as well.
---
Maybe someone doesn't want to leave a Bill on the ground since he's more likely to have Unbreakable. Same with hooked Adam and his deliverance. 
---
Maybe that Spirit that you're playing against which you **know** doesn't run Ruin, That hex totem that you're seeing surely it has to be Haunted Grounds? Boom nope it turned out to be Devour hope as she started one shotting after 3rd hook.
---
I've played vs killers even at high ranks that has **only** ran Thrill of the Hunt with no other hex totem. Really makes survivors paranoid about devour hope etc. Not gonna say it's a great play but it's fun mindgames.
---
Maybe at higher levels you'd sort of expect NOED on that high rank Wraith or Trapper. Maybe it takes you by complete surprise by a Huntress or Billy?
---
So much perk meta into your own expectations.
---
Just for curiosity, he still plays dbd?
---
Insta heals are yeah nerfed but now have counterplay and can be used still. Like second wind with extra steps
---
If you wanna address Mori then address keys too my dude
---
It is meant for the killer to walk less wheeze more. Not every killer can power walk like Michael or run or manipulate space and time. But yea what i jus wish is that it would also block totems and chests lol.
---
Lord forgive me for what I’m about to do.
---
This is like honestly the best Susie cosplay I've seen on this sub so far. The level of detail on that mask is astonishing!
---
Always happy seeing cosplay of my main lol
---
Found the person that never plays surv. Double crouch is thank you and expected after heals.
---
they removed it due to it being buggy on certain maps
---
You learn map layouts automatically if you want to win anyway, there are no mindgames for the perk, the risk is minimized because of the fact that if you go for the OoO the entire swf will knew that and will know where he is at all times, if you dont they will know where your position is as well
---
There is no skill involved in using this perk especially against killers like wraith and ghostface who cant even mindgame with their pallets because there is a fucktard seeing everything you do
---
Glad its getting nerfed, because dillusional people like you will keep defending it anyway, just like people defended the OG dicisive strike because its "once per game", or MoM because "hillbilly counters it and its a good counter to nurse" or infinites because "you can just leave the person going to the infinites"
---
I have been the killer since trapper was getting a stroke every time he was setting a trap and i know how bad its for the game
---
That saying if you want to fulfill your power fantasies go to r/dbdgonewild but leave the game balance alone because you clearly dont know what you are doing
---
Oh my gosh I’m so flattered! I’m glad you like it so much, Susie is such an underrated character. Her design and model is beautiful and detailed compare to the rest of the Legion, you can tell whoever designed her really cared about her ♥️♥️♥️
---
Welp, that would make too much sense to bring it up! They are essentially the same thing but better nerf Mori if they touch insta heals.. -.-
---
While in the same patch they addressed Nurse.. ¯\_ಠ_ಠ_/¯ some people are kinda dumb
---
YES.
---
Killer tracking or the one that let's everyone see what you see are interesting... but yeah I only ever use maps when it is pretty  much the only thing I'm finding in chests as I prefer most everything else to them
---
Myers would be a really cool cosplay
---
Very nice Danny Boy 👌
---
Holy shit this is unbelievably good
---
I mean, yeah, if you own all of them this becomes a new story.
---
Also me on survivor when I try to run a Head On meme build instead of meta perks then get destroyed by a P3 spirit
---
I think maps can be super helpful on indoor maps where gens can be difficult to find, however you don’t know what the map is usually going to be until you start so it’s hard to predict that unless you have an offering for a specific place
---
Because its easy. Thats why
---
You ain't completing those dailies if you kill yourself....
---
That's a way better idea than mine, that it would block totems. More people would use it.
---
otz defintalty otz he is the best streamer honestly you will feel like you are attending a class when you watch otz his streams are really informative and he explain every single little move he do  he makes good youtube guides and honestly he should be the face of killer mains the most polite person ever
---
laugh tier list when?
---
I'm not sure what you are talking about.
---
Blink movement speed is the fastest speed outside of the hag teleportation. You don't EVER lose ground on a survivor if you are blinking towards them. Old nurse AND new nurse. Even if you swing at air and take the extra fatigue every blink. 
---
1 blink to chase, 2 blinks to hit. Anything else is just being a potato. Period. The best nurse mains all say the same thing, and some rando saying otherwise with some vaccum math and no solid proof is just complaining about the cooldown change like they relied on the most unfun parts of the killer. 
---
Does anyone even pay attention to all the YouTube videos that have been coming out? Nurses are still destroying, it's just a longer match by 3 seconds per chase or so. Which is only fair considering how much stronger nurse has always been.
---
Thanks for reminding me 😭
---
Oh hey man. I saw you got a bit upset yesterday during the stream. Cheer up bud, it happens. Thank you for the amazing content
---
if OoO hurts you when you are playing hag, thats enough for me to invalidate all you have just said
---
Three, Two, One, Let it stab!
---
One more thing, this game could be so much more, but BhVR allows their players to run wild and do what they want! They have no balls or say on suspending people who play on console, plus if they put some real effort and I mean real effort into fixing this game and start cracking down on the toxic bs, you would see and experience a truly amazing game. 
---
I’ve seen what happens to game that are on this state...
---
I wear the watermark with pride
---
Yea but you know. The Spirit was sucked in when she was dead and cut into pieces.
---
He also confirmed that for killers that were in the game at that time.
---
We have to take everything as "for now" from them.
---
No clowns. No religious killers. No talking killers.
---
You did it, you absolute legend. ❤️❤️❤️
---
I main Legion and don't think they suck.
---
I despise people like this
---
&gt; he should be the face of killer mains 
---
Please don't.
---
Wazzzzzuuup
---
I agree. Somewhat easy, but still cool and different. The hardest part is finding a mask that isn’t deformed
---
In indoor maps a gen is, where a door is closed.
---
Hey, I have those gloves too.
---
Some one was hacking i can smell it
---
Really brings a new meaning to being exposed.
---
Big brain plays by the Nea
---
I do as well. I’m just saying that I’d like to see the community try some different killers (Hillbilly, Hag, Clown, Wraith).
---
Absolutely did not even come close to "taking it like a champ". You didn't watch the stream at all if you think that. He was about as shook as a person can be and then proceeded to run omegablink nurse with an ebony mori.
---
Activate windows
---
What’s so bad about mematic?
---
Yes but you dont often know where you are going to end up unless you use an offering so still a pretty pointless item lol
---
They are the only cosplays that are easy to do besides micheal. And i dont really care that much since i like legion and piggy.
---
CLAUDETTES WHO CROUCH AROUND THE MAP AND REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING! RAN PAST TWO OF THEM IN THE SAME MATCH CROUCHING WHILE BEING CHASED BY HUNTRESS! MUST I DO ALL THE GENS MYSELF?
---
Yes
---
Personally I watch a few smaller ones, although I'll hop into Otzdarva stream every now and then
---
  
---
I'd say Brother\_Cope and DowseyTV are very enjoyable, and if you want to take an even deeper dive down to a lovely streamer I'd suggest Fourgees. But the first three are better if you want to watch some higher level play
---
Fantastic play
---
I'm gonna be ghost face for spooktober
---
Vinc3ntvega is good and hilarious. Does some good characters too
---
Wait you're telling me i have to play 2 games in order to get used to something? Too much work I'm out, survivors OP yet again, time for an ebony to punish the toxicity of survivors making stridor a perk I need to get used to, only viable killer can't even hear properly fuck you BHVR I want my money back.
---
I can't think of a better way to stall gens than taking two people out of the match in 2 minutes, so, that's fair.
---
"He grabbed a forty, smashed it on the ground and yelled SCATTER!"
---
If you're a girl then imma be your boyfriend
---
Hey! I was wondering how you made your ghostface costume. I’ve been wanting to make one but didn’t know where to start.
---
Scorpionz is my favorite, he is so fun to watch and watching him helped me get rank 1 pig as well!
---
Poor Claudette
---
The look just appeals to more people. Considering they're the two most modern killers time period wise.
---
Omae Waru... Shinderieu
---
Besides like Michael and Freddy(but who wants to be a pedophile)
---
Huntress with long hair is all I want
---
Same!
---
I like using rainbow map with both range addons (yellow stamp and green stamp) for 3 reasons: hunting hex totems, just hunting totems in general for my Inner Strength, and hunting for hatch in the endgame
---
It's about money not what some rando on reddit wants.
---
Stay strong mate! I may not know you and neither do you know me, but even as a total stranger I can tell you you're worth the positive things in life too!
---
Keep your chin up and have a little fun every now and then.
---
Also, feel free to PM me if you need an ear.
---
Tbh I feel like 2018 Laurie would be the Killer chasing Myers, not the other way around.
---
A lot of people are no at the skill level to pull off those characters. Those are hard cosplays.
---
I don't know who that is, but if someone to turn into this much of a crybaby I kinda wanna look them up.
---
This is where the fun begins.
---
Thats why i main both roles
---
RBT is useless when Exit's are powered.
---
it used to be when putting RBT on somenoe the timer would start (when all gens are already done) and kill you if you go too far in the Exit.
---
i see why it got changed, thats just fair BUT BOTH?
---
should been have just one of those 2.
---
Awesome!
---
I'm thinking of doing a Suzie costume for Halloween. I've got a purple hoodie that looks very much like hers!
---
Oh hell yeah man! I rarely see Xbox Wraith players tbh.
---
I mean, yeah this would be nice but they kinda do this just all the time.
---
The chapters are kinda used to introduce new content.
---
But yes, a better focus on fixing some of these things would be very nice.
---
I've only encountered a Clown once and they DC'd when two of us were left
---
Yeah, all I see is shapes and spirits
---
Ok
---
Save scoops and baby dweets. They did nothing wrong.
---
it’s soo annoying
---
Unless is says they don't stack they stack the only add ons that don't stack will always say doesn't stack
---
Lol , today this was a coincidence today https://clips.twitch.tv/CorrectSassyHippoVoteNay
---
Beware vaccum man. New killer in doorway
---
Just thinking about Plague's legs gives me a stiffy so powerful it lifts my desk up
---
This is a spam/reposting bot. 
---
It reposts something that was popular every few minutes or so all over the places.
---
Tunneling kind of makes the game pretty boring, but you can’t really force or make people change their play styles. 
---
Besides, they already have perks to counter tunneling, so as long as the tunneled survivor is decent at looping and your team can do gens, it’s either they just get the 1K or the survivors manage to do the gens and are able to save the survivor
---
Its because he is DLC and isnt very special. I play clown here and there but it gets boring he is weak and is literally m1 with kinda useless throw
---
Is this a copypasta ? Seems familiar
---
Uhhhhh remind me how hes weak again?
---
They’d still make money from season passes $10 when a chapter is like $6-$8 but a season pass is just cosmetics so it wouldn’t effect the game mechanics where as a chapter with 6 perks, new power and multiple addons would. They’d still make money regardless.
---
ooooh. what's the fortune say
---
Cause I enjoy playing him
---
Happy cake day
---
It wasn’t really any one match. He’s ranked up really quickly after reset so he kept going against the same few survivor teams who obviously play this game a lot. Pretty much every game was multiple syringes, Object of Obsession, Haddonfield offerings, etc. and he was playing killers like Clown and Wraith. He was getting more and more tilted and eventually started running Nurse with an ebony, then one of the insta heal teams he’d faced prior disconnected in the loading screen to dodge the mori which was pretty hilarious.
---
I don’t blame him for getting tilted, we’ve all had a bad run of matches, but he probably should have switched to survivor for a bit or something because he was obviously not enjoying himself at all.
---
FINALLY GETTING A LOBBY WITH GREEN PING JUST TO GET DODGED BY THE KILLER
---
Why’s it bad because ps4?
---
I ACTIVATE POT OF GREED, THIS LETS ME DRAW TWO CARDS
---
Instead of "Adept Ghostface" the achievement should have been called "GOATFace"
---
*rank 7 killer joins* oh fuck
---
I mean people won’t stop using bbq or adrenaline if they make some perks better they fill a niche people want sometimes like stake out I can’t hit greats for the life of me but With stake out I can power through ruin without spinning every once in a while
---
Bubba has some sweet succulent lips (ﾉﾟ0ﾟ)ﾉ
---
Yes, I saw the flair.
---
Aw, and then Ghostface will have a boyfriend to murder, how sweet of you!
---
Oh we found the one guy who "doesn't know who that is" and he's a killermain what a coincedence, stfu you're so full of shit.
---
Nope. I think it’s a crucial part of a survivor’s kit. You better know how to loop though. Nothing funnier than downing a surv 15 seconds after they tea bag.
---
But I guess I’m going to have to take that as a yes to my question since you’re avoiding it.
---
Idk, only dudes main David
---
I feel like it is time for another scream movie no?
---
I’d smash
---
Zero map pressure
---
I've always wanted to die
---
Thanks! I think it's a healthy buff tbh, because a lot of killers will down people with their alternative attacks
---
Imagine getting this butthurt over a video game lmfao
---
I thought it was a glitch and got killed because I was too busy staring at it lol
---
I really hate to say this... Spirit with Prayer Beads/Amulet with a Mori. It’s one of the most sweatiest ways to play Killer. Just save it for survivors who truly deserve it, not ones like me I just want to plunder :(
---
Operation health electric boogaloo
---
&gt;**Orbital Laser
---
&gt;*Ultra Rare Add-on*
---
&gt;A menento of your first ever plot to destroy the world. Press the secondary action key to call down an orbital strike on your current position, killing any survivors in the blast radius and instantly converting any indoor map into The Swamp. 
---
&gt;*"Ima Firin' mah Lazer!"* -Unknown
---
That last down was rad
---
Kindred caps at 24 meters I believe, it prevents such a scenario from happening
---
Saw C0n?
---
Maybe for survs they get small bonuses in action speeds that suit them. Like meg runs at like 103% ms or claud heals faster or ash repairs gens a little quicker
---
Loool imagine getting this butthurt because I don't suck your whiny manchild grown ass bald man idols dick. Why are you still here?
---
Lol
---
Liver alone!!!! Lol
---
With a bit of luck, it’s almost as good hahah
---
Ah, rank reset, rank 10 going against a baby facecamping pig and 3 rank 20 teammates. R.I.P baby Bill, I tried to help you understand that you needed to get the trap off your head :(
---
Lmao dude you're a clown
---
Well it kinda resembles the bad acting performed in the Evil Dead movies
---
Could also work for when you have a legendary key at the beginning of the match and you’re searching for the hatch
---
I don’t even like tru3, but whining like a baby on reddit isn’t going to do anything
---
Hes good at ending chases quick. Thats pretty much it
---
I mean yes you can't please both sides but giving a flat buff to all killer powers while survs get nothing is going to create problems.
---
Killers also have perks and addons.
---
The only thing survs have are items, which are essentially the equivalent of killer powers but worse since they are consumable and you can lose them.
---
Are you saying it is or isn’t balanced? I assume you’re saying isn’t in which case you agree with me? Odd but sure.
---
Right that's why you've been refreshing this thread for the last 10 minutes so you could respond to me like a whiny bitch, suck my balls you fucking whiny loser killermain.
---
I would love to see this from Nea's point of view. xD
---
*Photobomb a Ghostface Selfie 1/3*
---
Yeah this is true. When I play killer if I start annihilating the survivors I'll start taking it easy on them. I do this mostly because I want more points.
---
Theyv made cells only cosmetics avaliable for shards for a limited time. Very rare when they do that tho. I think theyv only done it twice.
---
Not even a killer main lol. And thanks for proving my point
---
That's so awesome.
---
Sick artwork, have you made any others? You are clearly a talented drawer
---
When you go against Toxic survivors for the 7th time in a row.
---
*"Thats it, Im gettin me Mori"*
---
I guess so. If you bring pink and purple addons its illegal. They bring keys and pop gens in 2 mins its all ok.
---
We came for the horror and stayed for the asymmetrical “competition”. 
---
I don’t know how they bring us back to the terrified noob state without breaking balance.
---
On a side note we use to have offerings that made the game lighter and darker...I actually enjoyed them.
---
yea thats people for you, I don't want look like a circle jerker for "SuRviVoR bAd KiLLeR gOoD" but a lot of them can be very entitled and do anything to make the killer think he's playing the "wrong" way. Don't let them get to ya
---
Lmfao you gonna spend your whole day making posts and accounts just to whine then have them get deleted?
---
*skull fetish intensifies*
---
Not as much as the Ghostface mains though.. ;)
---
This frame rate is killing my eyes. You also seem like someone who has just started playing the game
---
I'd recommend getting like at least 600 hours in the game before starting up a youtube channel
---
I feel like im doing dumb.
---
This post is a certified bruh
---
I HAVEN'T PLAYED IN WEEKS ARRRRRRRRRRRRGH! I WANT TO PLAY DAMMIT ALL.
---
Soon he will be the killer
---
People just want to have fun, you didn't do anything wrong but if someone thinks they're not going to have fun they'd much rather leave instead of "wasting their time". Even tho it's a waste of your time for them to DC.
---
O believe me  I am very sure that I play a solid Friday camp don't tunnel don't even have to with his new rework but every once in a while I would like to actually use and an honor to most the time I just go in raw and I still get 3 to 4 kills I didn't have ruin on I'm not a total dick but come on
---
I literally won’t let anyone mend me!! I had a Claudette tap me while mending???  I pointed and told her to Fuck off and did it myself while she stood there waiting to mend/heal me.  Then later proceeded to spam unhook me and drop every pallet I would (or would not use) in a chase.  The AUDACITY
---
Hun I have 1000+ hours and have been rank 1 numerous times. New steam account.
---
Myers / Nurse main.
---
Basically never play survivor tho haha, only been as high as 10 on surv
---
They reworked Freddy.  He went from F tier to A tier.
---
Buddy if you don't like them you can just fuck off remember?
---
Cool killer I play, but sadly the weakest killer. :(
---
*Bubba and Wraith want to have a word with you*
---
Yeah... I had one of these moments as killer where people posted the exact same scenarios in this subreddit
---
I’m with it. I’d also support them if they change the ghost face mask to the derp face when he takes a selfie after his mori.
---
Then you should really upgrade your specs. This framerate is unwatchable, even on 3.0 speed
---
Lmao enjoy having your post up for a whole 10 minutes ochido fanboy
---
You Are Loosing your time
---
What two other perks does he use with this build and any particular addons besides the restraint one?
---
You sauced me with a video thumbnail
---
That's brutal.
---
i mean when you see a team of P3 Claudettes what do you really expect, same goes for Scoops in my book
---
hey, that's my line
---
Thought I recall a dev stream where they talked hitboxes and had fixed it a few months ago.  Guess not.
---
am i missing something? what happened
---
Specs are fine. Found out it was a rendering error. Only discovered after uploading as it was fine in the raw video, and fine whilst in Vegas.
---
Think it’s due to recording in 30 then rendering out in 60
---
Please do so
---
GL finding a rule I broke reject.
---
Darken all the maps and make the light source come from the moon.
---
If they were to change the time burden on the survivors like how Project Resistance and Death Garden does it and balance the game that way it would be more fun other than just the endgame.
---
Its a Wraith thats bodyblocking it though
---
The one on the right is just taking a weird piss
---
And that is why surivors will lose. Lol
---
Lol I dont need to when your last one clearly was deleted. Got another account ready to go for when this post is gone?
---
I posted about this some days earlier, why people without creativity do this thing the not a single person that has a brain will buy
---
there aren't different definitions of tunneling, there's literally tunneling. Which comes from the idea of tunnel vision, in that you focus so much on one thing you block everything around you out to focus on said one thing, in this case it's 1 survivor you have tunnel vision for, so much so that you block out anything else going on in the match to tunnel him.
---
Also when considering that, I'd want to hook the never hooked over the already hooked still, you get more points out of it being a fresh target and bring a 2nd survivor closer to death hook as opposed to still only 1 survivor being close to death hook. Your goal is to sacrifice all 4 survivors, not 1.
---
Kid I know you're 12 and you're only here for gay myers pictures, but the double standard is actually pretty cancerous and it doesn't just happen in DBD either.
---
I tunnel but i dont go out of my way to do it. In other words, ill only tunnel down a survivor if it saves me time vs going for the unhooker.
---
The best is the difference between the game photo and the ingame-photo
---
When you start streaming, when you put yourself on a pedestal like that, you stop being a random person and start being a face of the community.
---
That's amazing. Don't stalk me okay? Im too lazy to look back at you
---
Wait aren’t you the same guy who just messaged me on your other account telling me to get run over by a car? lmao
---
Not yet
---
Because it may trick some people or people get it out of curiosity
---
I think bing bong does it? At least it's what it seems in first person
---
I escaped once. It was pretty cool
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; ban dodging
---
One guy from an swf saced himself on hook and give me the kill they where playing really well but so was I but in a non try hard sort of way we were both pretty good guess that's why they give me the kill
---
Yeah i've seen a lot of shitty legion cosplays on this sub. They have to explain what they're cosplaying because you'll never guess by yourself
---
Yesterday someone booped the snoot. I let them do the last few gens and escape.
---
Hatch doesn't spawn until the number of completed gens is 1 more than the amount of living survivors.  If all four survivors are alive, the hatch doesn't spawn until the 5th generator is completed
---
Maybe rank up so you don't get potato teamates?
---
Soo.. You decided to for one leave your teammates behind without even trying and two, you decided to be a dick to the killer and deny him points..
---
The problem is skill check FPS is locked at 30. Nothing you can do to change that
---
That's why I love playing baby Dweet. If I'm the last remaining survivor and the killer finds me, I give them my item, crouch and make puppy eyes. 60% of the time, it works every time.
---
Yeah I wouldn’t watch angry pug, he’s kind of an ass, But good ones are, Otz, noob3, tru3, puppers, and you can pick up a thing or two from otz and tru3
---
FROM WIKIPEDIA
---
My god if this subreddit doesn't make me go gay because of you horny idiots I don't know what will.
---
I played with a huntress the Meg was hatch camping not helping anyone then when I died I message The huntress meg then got killed and we all escaped we also played survive with friends with him
---
When you put it like that, yeah
---
pog
---
We live in a society
---
Repost
---
Yup, some times it’s smooth some times it’s not. Fucking annoying
---
Yeah, I could be a shitty noob survivor but I had a team to follow, as a shitty noob killer... Well, you'll get no help haha.
---
If I ever decide to play killer I'll probably have to watch some videos or something of killers playing  so I don't end up sucking as bad haha.
---
Most people I've met through dbd have been nice, like you are, though. So even though that person was a jerk, most people are pretty nice, so it's all good.
---
It obviously allows for fewer mistakes and stretches your ability to make the the best decision in a shorter amount of time. Ruin is absolutely a crutch that I use at high ranks to alleviate the penalties I suffer from making mistakes during chases or when pressuring/slugging improperly.
---
They won't nerf her because she can cross the Badham gap if you're skilled in your dash. Stop being a pessimist who takes away from others enjoyment of the game out of your own paranoia. 
---
 If crossing that gap was such a massive problem
---
They would have removed the ability to dead hard over it
---
Nurse would have been reworked long before now 
---
And the Demo wouldn't leap
---
 The pig is more like the first than the latter two in that you actually need to be skilled to do it or you'll just hit the corner and fall in. 
---
I get not trusting the devs, but to go as far to say someone posting a neat play is grounds to get a character nerfed is delusional.
---
Hey fuck you don't remind me of my poor life choice or crippling anxiety
---
I’ve had that. I’ll get a new ritual, switch screens, then when I look again it’s something completely different.
---
Can you pet Maurice in game?
---
Not watching 17 minutes for someone to farm
---
Not the easiest, that moment was actually my hail mary. I was more than prepared to hit the corner and fall in like my other previous attempts at the gap.
---
Honestly I've considered doing this many times. Few reasons I haven't, not least of which being "I don't like deranking."
---
It making the game last longer allows for more mistakes on killers end.
---
Assuming ruin stays up and survs are not commited to gens and instead are looking for it, you can tunnel 1 guy through every pallet on the map and still 4k. You have no pressure on anyone else in that scenario, it's bad but you still win, so you feel like you did good.
---
You don't learn anything from that because when ruin does go down instantly, you can't do that.
---
I reached R3 killer with ruin. If it got cleansed early I almost always got a 4 escape. Once I removed it, I almost always got a 4 escape. So now after the reset, I'm taking it off and learning to apply pressure without the bandaid that is ruin. Ruin carried me to r3, I was way out of my depth and only could compete because of the time it bought me.
---
Since the end goal is to play without ruin as it's unreliable. I'd like to learn to play without it.
---
I get Clauds, but what is so annoying about a Scoops Ahoy boy? It's not like they Urban around the entire match
---
I gave my map to the pig and booped the snoot then I was granted freedom
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECUrlnXCqk
---
I played a game as trapper on haddonfield and was praised for placing traps at obvious survivor routes.
---
all
---
It was a pre made path
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
I think you're just gay
---
Loool, when this fix?
---
I outplayed a killer, all survivors escaped but I felt bad so I wanted him to kill me but he wanted me to escape then he downed me and dropped me out of the exit gate and it forced me out.
---
So anytime a survivor brings stupid items I should camp them and watch them lose their items.
---
The Huntress didn't miss, the Nea used Dead Hard
---
This is the pig
---
Just about every scoops steve is as toxic as pink haired neas in my experience
---
I jumped in to take aggro for an Adam who got caught being afk for a moment at the start of the match. Later on that same Adam jumped in to take the aggro for me in a chase, he unfortunately ran into a trap very quickly. Never had someone return a favor like that in a game; bless up to my boy Binkus7.
---
Your logic: Arguably one of the best killer players doesn't need it = nobody really needs it.
---
You can't be thinking only about the top 5%. An average killer that forgoes ruin is inviting a world of hurt on themselves.
---
Wish I could fit that. I’m too fat
---
Dlc right? I was thinking of buying a dlc, Wich one you would recommend?
---
hybrid panda
---

If that's how you have fun go for it.
---
Looks really good but where is your knive boy?
---
Nice cosplay!
---
You want another picture with the knife?
---
People play whoever they have fun as, even if it’s a rough time you play the killer that’s mechanic you like the most.
---
I understand. Thats why i said it in the title. I just wanted to say i like it when the killer cant get you and he surrenders. Thats why he stops chasing you and start farming. Thats an instant win for survivors.
---
Damn, those thighs
---
It's fucking ridiculous that Behaviour thinks that players having a 6 rank difference is acceptable, especially since they count Ranks 16 to 20 as being the same. That means that (in theory) a Rank 10 Killer can go up against a bunch of Rank 20s as well as a bunch of Rank 4s and the matchmaking would consider it "acceptable."
---
I understand that there have to be compromises but I'm of the firm stance that I'd rather wait 10 minutes for a balanced match than 5 minutes for an unbalanced one. And as it is currently you wait for 30 minutes to get an unbalanced one.
---
I literally just bought spirit and I feel bad but she is so fun
---
Jasons got pretty bad form
---
You expect to find good killers on this sub? :D
---
I just walk up to him and use my emotes on him. He’s not picky, he just appreciates the attention.

I just wish most survivor mains actually knew what tunneling is.
---
I had some help with the sewing, but I can tell you how it was made. Just got some classes to do
---
Go make posts about totem spawns you whiny scrub
---
Heeeey I'm on this sub... but touche.
---
Because AAAAAAAAHHH HAHA \*cough cough\*
---
Go fucking watch his stream and enjoy it but stop with it you disgusting cringy fanboy.... - _-
---
If you want to compete above your skill level then yeah you probably need ruin but if you sit down and accept the fact that maybe "I'm not as good as I think I am" It's not mandatory at all.
---
If you don't want to improve and just want to win- Ruin is great. It carried me to r3 killer and if it got instacleansed - I couldn't compete with them survs. 
---
Since people have reached R1 without it though - It literally is not mandatory, That's a fact not an opinion.
---
Saying "Oh but hes a good player!" ofc he is, he reached rank 1, I'm not going to use bad players to imply ruin isn't mandatory, that would be stupid.
---
Not gonna lie, as a survivor main I love it when he steps in his own trap whilst carrying me or chasing me lmfao
---
IF THE KILLER GIVES YOU HATCH WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE IN ANY POSITION TO SAY SHIT LIKE "GG EZ" I LITERALLY GAVE UP A 4K  TO GIVE THE LAST GUY HATCH BECAUSE ONE OF THEM DC'D (THAT'S A WHOLE PROBLEM ON ITS OWN) AND THE GUY SENDS ME "YOU SUCK GG EZ GIT GOOD"
---
Ermm what😂😂. Who pissed in your Cheerios buddy. Get a life
---
That's honestly what it's like playing as Michael. His emblem scoring events are hot garbage, and I leave games constantly with clean 3Ks and only like 23k points.
---
I always wonder how tf can I get the Ghost face Oufit from dbd
---
this is so pure I love it
---
That was changed with the update. Before, it could be used at any time and the ranks increased the stun time.
---
Wow not a low effort Legion cosplay. Where did you buy the mask from?
---
My experience as killer is horrible. As a rank 10 killer I am normally put with2 rank 6s, a rank 5, and a rank 16 (or something similar), or I get put against a swf. I havent had a game that should be balanced in 2 weeks or so.
---
When I play survivor, it is 50 50. Sometimes I get a fair match with maybe 1 person slightly higher or lower (like, one person is 2 ranks lower/higher than the second highest rank), or I am put with a purple, and a rank 1 and rank 20 (I am a green rank survivor).
---
Why didn't you save me from the hook, Dwight?
---
You know you don’t have to click on his posts right?
---
that's really good to know, thanks
---
Exactly, it was like "wtf!, what's with this totem? FUCKEN SHIT, SCATTER!"
---
I..don’t know how I should feel
---
LITERALLY GIVES ME AN ANXIETY ATTACK WHENEVER SURVIVORS DO THIS.
---
Honestly, the 3 best Dlc killers rn in my opinion are Freddy, the spirit, and Michael. 
---
So shattered bloodlines, The nightmare on elm street, or the Halloween chapter. The stranger things chapter is also worth money but the Demo falls just short of being a Freddy/Michael level killer.
---
I am a pig main as I am a vehement saw fan. Not really much else. She's a weaker killer 
---
Killers to avoid unless you reallly want their perks and they aren't spawning on the shrine are the legion and leatherface.
---
That's not to take away from leatherface as a killer. But a lot of new players choose him and develop a playstyle that is unsustainable at high ranks and on different killers. Legion is just a mess.
---
I actually had the Apple add on for 1 corrupt pool. They never cleansed.
---
Nah it’d make it unfair, as killers who are new would struggle even more. When they’re the ones who need a boost. Plus how would it work, like spirit doesn’t need a power buff
---
Lemme join in aswell, my Brothers ;D
---
This is beautiful. The face and expression are spot on and it's an amazing use of colour contrast. 
---
Thank you so much for sharing
---
My gf in game as Feng Min kissed me before we left through the exit gates
---
They just need a quick play, and then make ranks actually do something
---
Is there a video that shows maps with different lights affected by Bouquets? I'm curious.
---
This is amazing! I was thinking about being ghost face for Halloween but don't have time to make the costume unfortunately so I think I'm going with more of a techwear/military ghost face. Where did you get your mask though? It looks legit and I'm scared to buy one online because I'd like to get one that's better quality than the ones at Halloween stores
---
I feel really bad for those survivors specially when you look at the comments calling those survivors trash I wish they would blur out the names.
---
But Ghostface always makes a whoosh sound when he goes sneaky beaky like
---
You forgot the DC icon in the last panel.
---
Does Maurice make noise only when a survivor is near or anytime? Scientists cannot explain.
---
Sitting and watching the campfire for 5 minutes with the Pig (before the EGC). Talking about how difficult to play killer etc. (typical killer conversation) while other survivors leaving one by one (I was Nea btw lol). And then Pig escaped too.
---
With the manikins in her backyard it would be terrifying
---
Basically just imagine a black screen
---
Pretty good use of the dead hard
---
No they aren't every killer can do this with well placed dashes. Don't be a pessimist and spread unfounded fear like some American news anchor.
---
If you don't want to  be a sweaty tryhard, if you want to have some brevity in ranks 10+, ruin is mandatory. If you don't want to be a literal laughing stock for survivors and get t-bagged at the exit gates, ruin is mandatory.
---
If you want to be absolutely literal, then yes, you can win games and rank up without ruin, it is not completely mandatory. If you want to have any amount of fun in higher ranks, you need ruin and you need it to spawn good.
---
Oh yeah it’s big brain time!
---
Mainsssss
---
Gut me instead?
---
Yeah I can see that. Play killer is stressful by itself, by streaming it becomes even worse since you have to kinda suck it up and depending on your channel, you can't switch game or take a pause to chill
---
I can't blame him. He should find something to do when this happens on stream to keep it entertaining and at the same time relax
---
Looking Good There. I just realized you might have a new GFFG (Ghost Face Fan Girl) soon
---
r/deadbydaylight
---
Yeah but as soon as that patch drops it will open up a whole new world of bugs and glitches in the game. It happens every chapter.
---
I murdered a nancy as a baby nurse and she congratulated me. We then became friends and self almost every other day.

RYAN STARTED THE FIRE!

That's the system we need.

bang bang
---
this is amazing i like how the juice falls from her mouth, killers gotta kill
---
Sure it does. People DC because they're cowards and are rage quitting. Getting hooked, then suiciding takes a lot more effort.
---
We NEED this
---
Don't you think there is a reason she is not used in high ranks?
---
She is not a spirit a nurse or a billy, people that have played against her many times know how to handle her and loop her around, you can't expect devs just nerf her because a small group of midranks dislike playing her or refuse to learn how to play against her. Should they also nerf the doc because he stomps yellow ranks?
---
Yes, I know. He spelled it incorrectly lol
---
👁👄👁
---
show me your knife daddy
---
This makes me want to play trapper
---
Lmao but fr i was myers with scratched on rotten fields and i saw david go into a locker in killer shack. I walked thro the door and slowly turned toward his locker, nodded then ripped him out. After the match he sent me a message sayin he was streamin and that made him and his chat laugh.
---
Awesome
---
It was funnier because she tried to flashlight me and I used Franklin's. Everytime I smacked the l9ght out her hand I shook my head :D
---
*Spirit and Pig show up*
---
**AHOY LADIES**
---
These little comics make my day a whole lot better. Keep it up❤️
---
It makes the map so dark that you'd need a flashlight to see.
---
That perfectly cut meow tho
---
"just rank up lol"
---
Dude if the game didn't lower your rank monthly and expect you to play consistently every season then sure but red ranks aint that good either.
---
 amazing killer.
---
For context this game was made by a guy with his parents and cousins (or brothers  i don't remember). For more go on the DBD amino.
---
Mostly everyone has said this, devs should just pause adding new killers/survivors for a good 3 months and address horrendous issues with the game. Devs don't want to listen. I'd love to see a breakdown of how much they get from selling dlc and cosmetics versus selling copies of the game and government funding they receive. 
---
Behaviour is not a small little company of less than 20 people like a lot of people try to say it is to white knight the devs. The fact is that Behaviour is a company of 500 people and the largest indie dev in Canada. So how are they using these resources is anyone's guess.
---
r/unexpectedmulaney

Unclear

Okay but why’d you downvote me? Jason barely has anything to do with dead by daylight
---
Aww so cute
---
After rank reset I'm rank 10 now and the rest of my team is usually rank 19-20 recruits so I am on baby sitting duty most of the time
---
Papa Ghostface took us (all four survivors) to the circus once. Was a magical moment.
---
*a salute to our sadly less fortunate gamers, should life bless you with opportunity and fortune friend.*
---
Another antiememe
---
If he really wanted the EGC kill he A.) wouldv'e stopped him from opening the door B.) dropped him or C.) Hit him on the way out, Doc had plenty of time from dropping him to chase the kill. The red stain didn't even show up on his back as he left.

I CANT USE THAT UGLY ASS DOG FOR SHIT AND IT PISSES ME OFF CAUSE HES COOL AND SHIT!

SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO BE A GOOD BOI WITH THE BEST BOI! PLZ!
---
amazing, well done XD
---
If you're red then it drops you to like level 12.
---
Op says in another comment the killer thought he didn’t have enough time, he just misjudged it.
---
The perk icon still lights up
---
Unless you are OhTofu or Nurse main
---
What? Everyone posts clips on here, what makes it different that it’s otz?
---
I think he pissed in his own Cheerios for extra sodium swing how salty he is
---
WHY DOESNT TRAPPER START WITH BROWN BAG BY DEFAULT BY THE TIME I'VE PLACED 3 TRAPS 2 GENS HAVE ALREADY POPPED. YOU EITHER HAVE TO RUN BAGS OR RUIN TO HAVE A CHANCE.
---
STOP FORCING ME TO KEEP GOING THROUGH BLOODWEBS OF A MAX RANK KILLER JUST TO MAKE IT PLAYABLE
---
I like how he starts walking away but you can still tell that he’s hiding the pain in his lower back
---
Sick hatchets bro
---
Turn your monitor off and play
---
Are you suggesting they become filthy gen tappers? Lol
---
That shit probably takes longer than actually just doing the gen regardless of missing the greats 😂
---
Ghost face mask stays on during sex
---
uhm I don't know what to say
---
Feel free to mori me sometime, daddy &lt;3
---
And then it drops you to yellows, and then to browns. Skill-decay is practically a meme so it's not an excuse. Suffering through like 50-60 (even more than that I think?) pointless matches to reach an arbitrary goal because you haven't played a lot in a few months isn't very fun or intuitive.
---
You run much inner strength? It's a great perk in theory, but you've gotta waste just as much time if not more looking for a totem. This only gets progressively more difficult as the game goes on. Which is even more of a pain if you don't specify with your team first to leave totems for you. 
---
Adrenaline is an empty fucking slot if you don't make it to 5 gens completed. 
---
Again, selfcare isn't the best. But the hate people have for it is disproportionate. And you're blind or willfully ignorant if you don't think that any of the solutions to selfcare don't eat up just as much time or more unless you're under ideal circumstances of being healed immediately after a hook or are running aura tracking of some kind to find other survivors.
---
Its not about the skill nor the bloodpoints. Its about the quest objectives. I said "jokingly" that I rather have what OP was having than getting constant daily rituals for low tier (not fun to use) killers. That is all. Then you came in telling me to stop complaining.
---
You're more red riding hood than amanda
---
**ez no sweat**
---
They just need an AI mode. I hate waiting til rank reset to try out a new killer.
---
Because with inner strength you shouldn’t really be looking for totems. You do gens, and if you happen to pass a totem, you doit.
---
Makes my skin itch all over honestly.
---
Its fun because I can be a complete utter pos to these killers and not feel bad at all
---
thanks~
---
Good meme
---
good catch sir
---
IS THIS A BAIT IF YOU THINK FREDDY IS MID TIER GOD HELP YOU
---
HE NOT ONLY GETS GLOBAL MAP PRESENCE HE ALSO SLOWS DOWN EVERY SURVIVOR FOR FREE IN EVERYTHING THEY DO BY SIMPLY EXISTING
---
ONTOP OF THAT AS IF HE NEEDED MORE HE GETS SLOW DOWN TRAPS WHICH HE CAN PLACE ON A WHIM AND DOESNT NEED TO RELOAD EVER
---
IF THAT WASNT ENOUGH YOU ALSO DONT KNOW IF THAT PALLET YOU ARE RUNNING TO IS REAL OR YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE HIM A FREE DOWN UNTILL YOU'VE SEEN A DREAM SNARE
---
Red rankee who doesnt like playing against her here. The vomit makes me sick
---
But it's not a retcon she was never his sister in the original that details came in the sequel
---
The hatchet hit the camera man but Dwight still had to act it out
---
Dc's.....
---
Tbh it would of been better with a Red Rank survivor saying it to green and purple ranks lol
---
Or to stopthrowing up :( i can smell the fumes coming off my beautiful jeff
---
Very well made, kinda really like Bubba's face, you turned him into a handsome boy.
---
Yo, as many pics as you're willing to share. First time I seen a Danny cosplay and I love it.

Yup
---
I'm working on Darrel right now!
---
It is map dependent. On maps with strong buildings/second levels balanced is kinda op. Think haddonfield.
---
On maps with lots of strong windows (lerys or the new map maybe) lithe is insane especially with dance with me and maybe even Q&amp;Q.
---
On plain ol average maps like shelter woods I think that dead hard is the best, and it is the only one that will be just as strong on any map.
---
Pop goes the weasel is super good for slowing down the game as well, if you pair it with ruin you can really buy yourself the time you need
---
Lol Well used meme
---
THE ONLY MAP WHERE YOU CAN EFFECTIVELY COMPLETE A TRAIL IS SHELTER WOODS!

You are guessing my mentality wrong. I'm happy with two kills or a black pip if i felt like the game was tense and fun.
---
 Except people have proven this is not the case. You can reach the highest ranks without ruin - Fact. 
---
Yeah, but you won't have fun. You need to be a tryhard. That's stressful, i want to unwind a bit, not have to try harder than i do at me job.
---
Now this is a quality comment
---
For racism ofc
---
To his defense in the span of a week i've seen more survivors DC from being downed first that killers, Overall the killer to survivor ratio isn't even close (Killers being the main quitters) but recently players have been dropping like pallets in a rank 20 lobby
---
No, definitely not.
---
Possibly but I doubt it
---
I had plunderers and found the key in the item but leave it there. 1 survivor has a random DC, and after a while Plague hooks me in the basement, then proceed to vomit on me and proxy camping me. Nobody comes for my rescue, and I still PM the last surviving Claudette where the key is.
---
You'll get called out for merely existing while playing Killer.
---
Depends on the platform, i believe repeat offenses can get your account locked for awhile on PlayStation, but you should be fine
---
&gt; A BNP can be used four times per match as well, once per survivor. 
---
And BNP are nowhere near as impactfull as ebony mori. Yes, even if all 4 surv use it.
---
&gt; You've seen how badly Brand New Part got nerfed, so clearly the devs think that as well. 
---
Devs used to think that giving Surv 1 time protection as a "reward" for getting hit 3 times was good idea. Using Devs when they clearly are humans, make mistakes and make questionable balance decisions (Fun Fact: BNP used to repair gen instantly... U could do gen from 0 to 100% in just a click)
---
&gt; Killers are the Power Role. 
---
Yes... But not exactly. As i said before in 1 of my previous comments devs aim for a game where on avarage at start of the game as Killer u are gonna make 2k.
---
&gt;  That's how the game is supposed to be. 
---
What do u mean by that? U bring a lot of "surv needs to be weaker than killer" and " Killer is Power Role". No one argues against that. People argue that Mori gives Killer WAY too much power.
---
If u still gonna continue this discussion consider this:
---
Mori is poorly designed, bcs it gives Killer huge powerspike which leads to problems with balance bcs: either Killers without cant be the "Power Role" they are ment to be or without it they are the "Power Role" and with it they give survivor almoust no chance (note: no chance except for hatch and killer being hilariously way worse at game than survivors)
---
I've deliberately slugged Jane just to crouch over and stare at her ass.
---
Ugh this reminds me
---
I was playing with a friend, who died, and told me the claudette had a key, the killer hooked her dead, the other guy was on a hook struggling. It’s time to take the key in case killer finds hatch first! Nope. She had that add on that keeps key when dead. I died.
---
Okay I need to ask, why does this upset you?
---
You dont know that tho
---
"Oh? You're vaulting toward me? Instead of running around the wall you're coming right to me?"
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
"I can't mori the shit out of you without getting closer."
---
.
---
I haven't found a use for selfish care yet ever since they nerfed it. I just stay injured and work on gens until someone finds me or I find someone else on a gen after I've finished mine.
---
I have been a hoarding items since Myers first came out and from time to time my friends pressure me to use items or at least an offering and almost every time, I lose that item or offering due to tunneling, DC, Mori'd. Now I am starting to learn to say no to my friends just because of the amount of bs that happens when I put an item or offering. Idk why, but I even feel bad when I lose a common item.
---
Exactly
---
It’s not about *your comment* being upvoted or not, like you said it means dick. I downvote posts I don’t really want to see because it’s about all I can do to lower their frequency. Tossing negativity in the comment section just ain’t kind
---
💯 me. I failed chemistry
---
Well. I mean, I hate racist bastards and it's against the rules and law discriminate against them
---
Still, you just made fun of the language they were talking that was being used to insult you so I guess it's fair
---
I don't think you will get punished for that. Next time tho instead of saying something like that, speak in another language (even using Google translate, who cares) without insulting. They will think you are actually insulting and it's kinda a free report for them if they do
---
Ya know I've never thought of it that way in terms of just practicing to improve your skills, most of the Killers i've encountered who do that though are the angriest and sweatiest of the bunch.
---

It's been proven to actually be less efficient, there are vids on YouTube about it from people that researched it
---
"Laughs in nurse"
---
Less of a mindgame and more of Steve was just being dumb.
---
Debatable.
---
It depends on both how you tap and how many skillchecks you get. I've seen a gen at 99 get regressed down to about 60 in no time from skillchecks that simply would not stop. Also, some people who gentap do it too quickly. You can work the gen for about 16-17 bps worth without the skillcheck causing an explosion, which works way faster than just rapidly clicking.
---
why tho?
---
Yesss exactly this. I love playing Hag more than Spirit but Hag is just not made for chases so there will always be the pink-haired Nea who knows JUST how to trigger the traps and run away ASAP, which again leads to traps being unusable and Hag being more useless than Wraith.
---
Up until rank 12/11, Hag is fun but after that I have to depend on Spirit, basically.
---
I’m a pain in the killer’s ass every game so I never expect hatch
---
Who said they had the chance to get pennywise lol. Thats all just speculations. Pennywise is owned by steven king noone else. There was no leaked informartion about any agreement behaviour got to start working on pennywise. They prob dont even look forward to get pennywise. Maybe they want something else. Maybe they want nothing. Steven king  does a lot of collabo work so there might be a chance but dont be to hyped for something thats maybe not even comming
---
At least Ghostface can teabag back
---
I've always been wondering about the retired offerings, do you like normally unlock them if you have in bloodweeb and can use them or wat? do they disappear as soon as you unlock it?
---
If you are talking about PS, that means you are most likely not from Steam, though it seems that they give the least crap about it, remember when Poods played PUBG?
---
it works every time i try it
---
It's toxic
---
you couldn’t just type it out...?
---
Haha nice
---
Go for it! She’s a super fun character to do
---
Wow that's really good
---
You don't need to buy it if you've bought it before. It's optional and that's why most people don't
---
Iron Will Yes, Spine Chill though is my favorite it's tier 3 makes gen rushing with other perks a breeze.
---
You got so triggered over some people doing Leg Day you posted this twice
---
I love you for this... favorite movie of all time
---
Did u look at his perks. He has adrenaline. I run it and self care and tried inner strength a few times but I find myself  more focusing on finding a totem then doing gens and adrenaline is so situational that it feels like wasted slot half the time. Self care is a fine perk that if u aren’t near anyone u can patch yourself really quick, stop telling people what perks to use cause u personally don’t like one
---
cool
---
The Spirits I see walk away from the hook and then phase back as soon as the person is unhooked 1
---
Nein, Nein, Nein, Nein!
---
i’d probably go with the purple mechanic’s toolbox and the socket swivel (that’s the yellow speed right?). i’d save it until mid to end game in case someone accidentally 3-genned, or is going to 3-gen us so that you can get on and get off asap. you can also use it first gen to piss the killer off as you fly by their ruin.
---
I really like that, dope!
---
Yeah you can make mistakes and not lose because ruin is up, but if you tunnel for the 4K and feel like you did good it’s a you problem not a ruin problem. You can play the exact same way you would without ruin even if you have the perk on. That’s my point. You playing better or looking to improve isn’t due to you not using the perk, it’s because you’re actively trying to not make mistakes and improve your chase (or whatever really). You can still do all of that even if you had the perk on.
---
He quit before the escape animation was over. He was mad
---
Use Jeff next time.
---
Thank you I didn't think of using level 10 jeff
---
Bruh as a Killer Main I can safely say that you should be banned if you:
---
•tunnel
---
•camp
---
•mori
---
A Steve.
---
Should he wear the full Scoops Ahoy outfit or say “screw Company Policy” you cannot:
---
•Chase him
---
•Hit him
---
•Sacrifice him
---
Thanks, Chief
---
Holy shit, this is incredible! Will you post somewhere what you used for that cosplay?
---
Also, love the variation of "feeling cute, might delete later"
---
Except for all the other poor Scoops Steves the killer will go up against after you. They did nothing wrong!
---
If the killer doesn’t like, they can always dc. Get over it.
---
WHY ARE YOU SMURFING ON RANK RESET ,WHY DC ONCE YOU HAVE DROPPED EVERY DANG SAFE PALLET ON THE MAP BEFORE YOUR SECOND HOOK.
---
Your claim was nobody plays it, the first week is plenty of time to get sufficient data with how many people getting in it.
---
I don't see 70-80% average. Also, "win" doesn't equal "escape"
---
Why do people hate Scoops Steve so much? I've had a few toxic Steve's but I've dealt with much worse.
---
Granted, but you are the killer being bullied in it
---
love keep it up kid
---
Thx
---
to piggyback, i’ve been told the slot you equip the add-on matters (left slot affects the item, right slot affects both the item and the left slot). i believe this to be false, right? so as purely an example, a purple 32 charges med-kit with a pink insta-heal on the left slot and 12 charges on the right slot will be a total of 28 charges. but insta-heal on right and charges on left will be 22.
---
Can you still use them?
---
Well what about the second one?
---
Iridiscent Hatchet Heads make me alt+F4 every time. Completely goes against the game's design.
---
Not anymore
---
Which would slow down queues even more since it'd split up the playerbase in half.
---
NOT SURE IF THIS IS WELL KNOWN OR NOT BUT I LEARNED FROM A STREAMER THAT YOU CAN GET RID OF HER POWER IF YOU GET A PALLET SLAM ON HER. DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY LESS PAINFUL GOING UP AGAINST A POWERED UP PLAGUE BUT GIVES YOU OPTIONS ON TRYING TO PLAY AROUND HER CORRUPT PUKE.
---
Haha, have fun trying to find out why it isn't working yourself. I mean, I already know why.
---
Then make it better if that's how you feel.
---
Nice
---
Ruin allows you to make mistakes without losing, but you’re allowing yourself to make those mistakes in the first place. Taking the perk off will force you to play better if you want to win, but it’s more than possible to improve your gameplay without forcing yourself to do so through extraneous circumstances.
---
Bubba (leatherface) is a huge priority and since you have ps4 hag is free iirc
---
They disappear and those that you already have are locked
---
I can't read your hand writting
---
I KNOW BUT IS BETTER TO DON'T GIV HER ANYTHING
---
When I say I need a gf this is what I mean
---
You mean the third one? Vengeance? It's a very good perk that I like the idea of. It'd be hard to make people accept such a perk though, since many of them think survivors have enough ways to force killers to waste time as it is. 
---
Shame, since it's super interesting - it sounds like just deliberately blowing a gen, except without the regression.
---
Another day, another jack off post to otz

We are you that Nea?(?)

Shut and take my silver!
---
**Hello shortie, how are you doing**
---
i don't get it.  The Matchmaking is slow AND unbalanced, with me getting rank 17-20 teammates while I'm rank 9
---
I KNOW I'M NOT THE BEST KILLER IN THE WORLD, BUT PLEASE DO NOT CALL ME 'BABY', I AM NINETEEN YEARS OLD, THANK YOU SO MUCH
---
Playing as the Shape last night, stoned, I had a good five minutes where I walked around in complete confusion, accomplishing nothing.
---
Lmfaooo fuckkk.. thanks dude. I feel big dumb now
---
impossible to gen rush? i beg to differ \^\^
---
&gt; You can play the exact same way you would without ruin even if you have the perk on.
---
There is no reason for me to drop a chase if 1 gen pops, but if ruin wasn't up that might be 3.
---
I get that the reddit is ruin-pro but denying giving the killer more time to kill is not making it easier for the killer is... stupid?
---
I went to high school in Maynardville Tennessee, where Brad Pits character is from. It’s a 3 redlight town lol. He definitely nailed the accent. That place it a shit hole with meth and opiate addicts. Beautiful scenery but the people are awful.
---
I got rank 20 teammates and killer as a rank 10 surv.. I was planning on just messing around with locker plays but I kept finding my teammates in them. They all killer themselves on first hook and 1 guy dc'ed on hook. At least the killer was nice
---
Oh, well the second perk is the one I meant when I was talking about the killer perk, "I'm All Ears". Reducing noises in a chase is useless against that perk. It would be pretty bad in most situations, honestly, as bad killers have Scratches to help, and good killers know to scour the areas when the Scratches suddenly stop. 
---
Really good killer players who have worthwhile streams and stuff, most of them are MORE alert to the absence of noises. They get real suspicious when they suddenly can't hear breathing or pain sounds, and their map knowledge lets them make very educated guesses about your hiding spot.
---
Imagine doing at one of the worst killers in the game. 
---
(And he’s actually great at killing scrubs, so what does that say about you?)
---
I’d cosplay huntress if I was a foot taller and also a woman
---
just do the gen. you better off sticking, eventually you will just hit the skillchecks. i never search for ruin anymore, ruin its a wasted perk slot on high ranks, i run corrupt instead
---
How to store survivors in lockers for later
---
After I joined the party, all he did is just go on a rant about how bad of a killer I was for not letting him escape through the hatch.
---
You people are fucking lobotomites. Like, someone makes any kind of le funny sex joke and you link to cursed comments. Please, go commit die.
---
I'm so glad a rank 20 trapper can teach me how to play the game.  What about this video makes it worth the title? 
---
Blood Haven is not a good trapper map.
---
Just do what all the other terrible killer mains do, respect the pallet, get looped for even longer over that same pallet, then complain on reddit about getting gen rushed and lacking map pressure. :)
---
Spicy car oil, idk man
---
I always try to body block people while the frenzy cooldown animation plays. Works well almost every time.
---
30-45 minutes? If I'm waiting 5+ minutes for a match I'm gonna play a different game.
---
The lore seems amazing. His power maybe a bit overpowered though. I like it nonetheless
---
Why did ryan join the military
---
A small price to pay
---
In the words of CowsIAm: "What the actual pengis?"
---
Just don’t message them? Pretty easy solution to people being toxic.
---
I’ve seen this bug. No clue what causes it. But it happened to a demogorgon on lery’s. Also it took them that long to do gens against a no perk clown?
---
*laughs in bloodwarden*
---
And if he'd beaten you you would have gotten a fat "EZ GG LOLOLOLOL \*CRYING LAUGHING EMOJI\*"

I'll heal you every time I unhook. I' bring better together so people know what gen I'm on, come 99 this gen with me and I'll heal you before we pop it. You are using 2 perk slots on healing and those might be completely useless when killers are instadown, leave you broken like plague, have sloppy, thanataphobia etc. 
---
You don't need to be healthy all the time. People act like when they're injured they can't even play the game, these are the people who bring self care.
---
Is this supposed to be a cosplay?  You're just a guy in glasses wearing a dress shirt and a tie.
---
With M&amp;A im Tier 1 you have a 0 Terror radius. In Tier 2 you have a 8 meter Terror radius. Tier 2 with Dead rabbit and M&amp;A you get a 4 meter terror radius. Anyways M&amp;A is a top tier perk for Myers, he gets the most benefit out of all killers.
---
No no. That’s just the temp they hired to kill Dwight.
---
The PTB changes haven't gone through to the live game yet though, so as of now you need monitor and abuse to have the zero terror radius in tier one.
---
Not if everyone experiences it?
---
8 Haven't played much since reset. No, never DC.

Fixing things don't generate revenue. That's why we still don't have basic things like Rank rewards, which is something that every other competitive multiplayer game out there have.
---
"Pretty good job guy"
---
&gt; I said that the game being easier for you isn’t an excuse for you to play bad.
---
It's hard to tell when you are playing bad when your mistakes are not punished.
---
I don't understand your issue with me wanting to be punished for my mistakes.
---
As a red rank survivor, work on the 4 tasks, get killed/mori’d and pip... if you’re lucky you will escape 2 out of 10 games....
---
Real match, also do you know where to report teaming
---
Oh shit. Okay I get it now sorry, it's just I hardly see anyone use Jeff or his perks.
---
Whatever, keep on dickriding him, couldn't care less, just commented about it and pissed off a bunch of his bitches apparently lmao
---
I don’t think it needs the haste, but if it kept the haste, I’d say it should cause exhaustion
---
Props to u/ZombieHuggerr for the SFM formats
---
The synergy between dead rabbit and monitor and abuse is great.  Especially because dead rabbit is only a yellow add on.  
---
A further synergy you could do with monitor and rabbit is add in infectious fright, between the added TR for being in a chase it's even bigger from dead rabbit's boost in tier 3, so you'll generally be able to immediately chase another survivor and begin to snowball off that first tier 3 down.
---
Why the fuck do you take the time to comment that but you cant explain your reasoning? Honestly just shut up if you're not gonna say anything worth reading.
---
You look so cutee
---
Toxic
---
I actually rather like Lithe with Dance With Me, but I know a lot of people say it's the worst exhaustion perk and I have to agree. I personally don't like BL at all, but when survivors use it against me it always works
---
I'm pretty sure just about every map can use BL with pretty good results, it's just that some maps are great with it. Sometimes people act like BL is only worth if you're burning a Haddonfield offering
---
BABE 😍
---
It starts as fatigue goes off, so by the time you end fatigue you have 1 blink and in 1.5 sec you have your 2nd blink.
---
Isn’t hag in the base game and huntress as free dlc?
---
Nay
---
With my scientific analysis i have found that this blade is quite similar
---
simple, pretty much player ( killer and survivor ) is egoistic and sadistic. what u expect from a game that give you killing, chasing, playing with victim anyway

And dying light...and with bubba or billy with that add-on that slows survivor repair speed when hit with the chainsaw. It also gives the mangled effect I believe for a bonus.
---
Cry harder please
---
Whose cum is that
---
Massacred by Morning
---
My favorite so far besisdes random nice killers giving me the hatch was when i was an injured ace and ran into a corner. The huntress trapped me raised her arm to hit me with hatchet and I crouched while looked up at her knowing i was dead! She backed up and left me then let all of us escape and says damn ace at the end game chat LOVE YOU HUNTRESS!
---
I expect to not get DC when I just deal with survivors and killers using add ons I play both
---
Legion goes nyoom
---
Yeah it's not average it's by rank
---
It's not win.. it's survival rate. You can read right?
---
chill, we dont know how big the team is. we dont know how busy they are with other else. i believe they doing fixing thing that have a list " much important to less important " . but still, i really want to see they fix bugs too
---
Hag, Doctor, Ace and Feng are free on console. Huntress and David are free across all platforms
---
I’ve got this on my GameCast
---
Nurse is still the best killer, but that's not a minor nerf.
---
Ghostface, he is super sneaky, can crouch, stalks, when chrouching he has very small terror radius and he is very fun to play as
---
The game is straight up broken right now in a way I’ve never seen it
---
Yep
---
The fact you think you're making anyone cry is way funnier than anything else you've said.
---
With base game, I mean console’s base game (my bad). 
---
But yeah, that sounds about right.
---
This legion rework looks sick
---
No silly, that’s obviously Montaigne
---
This is so cool!
---
rank 1
---
i am rank 1 legion main

Wouldn’t it be slightly more difficult to pull off on PS4

Nah it just says they've been retired so they're stuck there for all eternity.
---
Fool! MY COLLECTION IS ENDLESS
---
When in DC land, do as the DCers do.
---
I mean you follow someone on twitch and watch their streams, then people chat shit for you following someone without any reasoning.  Show how much of an arse people are, like one guy has 138 downvotes on his comment, this is reddit not otz twitch chat. It's literally anyone noticing a person being a twat for no reason
---
Not at all, at least for experienced players
---
So what? If you take every group and solo players is a 50% split. Just because less people are 4 man swf doesn mean 3swf and 2swf doesn't exist
---
Plus, they play casually, so what? Even in league of legends most people play casually. The same can be said to Tekken, cs:go and so on. It's not the point
---
ANY pvp game MUST balance the game towards top players or at the very least, make it balanced so nothing can be abused in a fair competition, in a tournament or just with friends. DbD just have a lower player base than the games I listed, that's it
---
"Nobody should take this game seriously". Okay now depends on what do you mean with seriously! If that was true people wouldn't DC Everytime something don't go their way, rank won't exist and so on. You're wrong in so many levels
---
&gt; I get that survivors are going to win probably about 70-80% of the time,
---
My comment was about this statement of yours... You still think it's true?
---
Only thing that matters is perks. You won't win because your Biker Kate.
---
Care to leave some thoughts on a more mechanic based idea for her? (And rank means a lot, I've 4k up to green ranks with my level 1 doc)
---
Other got removed for not having flair
---
My name was “Innocent Baby Dwight” so I guess I got to live up to my name!
---
I find it funny how you could outrun the killer in this game by limping. Lol.
---
Might work

Yup, once on xbox. The entire map floor looked like something out of Tron.

Do you know if they work in KYF? I've seen them in the offerings but never tried one

That's an actual good idea

My change is just have her start with a pool by default instead of with add-ons.
---
i promise you that i am out there somewhere being laughed at
---
Very nice! How much?! My wife!!!
---
That happen to my in lerys, i die
---
yea i seriously dont understand why survivors just dont leave when they have the exit gate open... Like what do you gain out of it? altho it was really interesting when the endgame was glitched. i got so many dead cocky survivors that way. I would love to see survs that do that sort of punished. Like idk, speed up end game timer.
---
I have time to spend today.
---
Awwww, so gorgeous. Good stuff :D
---
removed for salty after game chat
---
Ooof, mercy 0 / destruction 100
---
ANTONIO MAH-GAH-REE-TEE
---
Yeah I was anxiously trying to escape, and after I did he left before we got to the menus. He didnt get points
---
Weird fact if a teammate has a aura that pops up on your screen with the little perk symbol (like Leader or Ace's luck increase one) it voids your run as it counts as you having it. Pissed me off a bunch until I realized this was happening.
---
A corrupted pool? That sounds pretty strong tbh, She always seemed like the kind of killer that gets much more difficult over time rather than immediately having a presence
---
I think that icon is the summer sideshow bloat from Killing Floor 2, Pukey the clown
---
Or he might've just been standing there letting you go. He definitely didn't DC during the match because you escaped.
---
they do not work in kyf
---
I loved this video. Hahaha
---
Yes he did. Shortly after the clip I got the loading screen with the dots and in the menu he had no points.
---
Just checked and nope, doesn't work. You could just dig up an old YouTube video to see it if you particularly wanted.
---
https://imgur.com/a/7hhq9n7

Exactly, see, they are downvoting every comment of mine like if I cared about arrows on Reddit lmfao losers
---
I believe in you! Also pls mori me when you get a chance
---
You don’t know that. The best thing they can assume is it’ll split 50/50, you willing to wait double time for a match?
---
“Looped you for 5 gens. gg ez baby killer. git gud.”
---
They didn't even try lmao
---
Candy Man
---
Honestly I hope they renegotiate the license holders for complete chapters for the characters it makes sense for.
---
Ash: Cabin and a killer (Eligos, Henrietta, Evil Ash)
---
Leatherface: More faces, a Survivor and  the Sawyer House.
---
Ghostface: Carl the Cashier and the Home Depot they were at.
---
It's a new perk called "Guilt Trip" 
---
While on the hook you float menacingly over survivors who are completing gens 3/5/10 seconds
---
Time to go to my local school
---
They could also all just be skins like Legion. That would be neat.
---
I played 3 killer games today for dailes all were 20minutes waiting time.
---
multiple repeated objects like grass and sometimes even larger objects like clutter or rocks are part of the ground mesh, kinda like hairs growing off it and scattered about in semi-random patterns. The hook is not part of the ground mesh, merely sitting on top of it and so it is unaffected by the bug.
---
I would say she is low tier either everyone walks around broken or you get a WMD
---
Then just tbag outside the gate
---
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE! I'M ONLY TRYING TO BRIGHTEN YOUR DAY WITH LOUD, PETTY HUMOUR!

Sure but just because it doesn't happen to you that doesn't mean it never happens

Due to a power outage we will be postponing The Archive live broadcast that was planned for 2PM today. We will communicate as soon as we have an ETA. Thank you. #dbd #deadbydaylight.
---
I really have no clue. Trying to keep new players out, maybe?
---
M&amp;A, Infectious Fright, Ruin, and STBFL or Bamboozle
---
If it bothers you and endgame is too long try this walk in backwards so face the other way so they run out
---
I like to use ruin, STBFL, monitor, Infectious fright
---
If you start bitching about Spine Chill after this, we're gonna have problems.
---
It's true! Just like Trix yogurt is better...
---
I use Ruin, BBQ, Monitor and Abuse (combo that with the dead rabbit add on, thank me later bro) and Pop Goes the weasel.  Discordance also good for finding survivors to stalk but I'd have a hard time switching any of the perks for it.
---
Enduring and spirt fury if you really wanna feel like him
---
Right, I’m not say it never happens, but I’m guaranteeing people are over dramatizing it. Im sure if those same people were playing any other skin they’d still would have been mori’d or tunneled by that exact killer.
---
I love how you can bring bong while still cloaked just to scare survivors
---
Or "BINGO!"
---
His expressions are perfect in that scene 😂
---
HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHA
---
I prefer that more
---
Not an actual one of her drawings, just a quick doodle.
---
No. Pretending 4 Survivor players = 1 Killer player is nonsense. I’m going game by game, not “Oh theres one toxic killer, so that must equal 4 toxic survivors”. You will hardly ever come across toxic killers in this game unless you really piss one off first. Survivors go into a game ready and planning to be toxic. Killer toxicity is not exclusively but more often than not a response to Survivor Toxicity, and usually ay lower ranks, since more experienced Killer players know to avoid being baited or how to adapt their strategies.
---
Survivors are the ones cheating with voice comms in swf at the end of the day.
---
You don’t see half as many sore losers complaining about insta heals and BNP genrushing and BT/DS Squads as you do people going “Wah Mori”.
---
There are way, way more toxic survivors in this game than toxic killers.
---
He was in the Russian prison
---
Once you know you cant catch them just go to a corner of the map and chill for 2min I never seen survivors ballsy enough to find you
---
This has literally been all my recent survivor matches since rank reset
---
I felt this. Every scoops ahoy Steve’s must band together.
---
Ah yes the big brain enlightened centrist “Both sides are bad” take

He has a rope around his neck - when he gets tired and is forced to let go of the bar he chokes.

Clearly this fool didn't practice grip strength. Hold one with one arm and use the other to take the noose off.
---
Although I don't do it to scoops if I see a claudette dressed in the darkest shit they can find they get a mori
---
The Doctore shut off the power again with his shocks. I guess we are going to have to be patient.

*Dead Before Sunrise:* ***H O R R O R***
---
I mean, it was retconed when it got rebooted, but was absolutely retconed from the story.
---
You’re really lucky, I’ve had a plethora of killers camp and tunnel me because I’m in scoops ahoy Steve.
---
As I once said while playing with friends, "PET THE HORSE PET THE HORSE PET THE HORSE PET THE HORSE PET THE HORSE"
---
Its not a bug, its a surprise feature
---
If you need help to do a gen, like, NEED help to do a gen - first look inwards.

And no, I don't use self-care.

---
# 👎
---
Thanks,finally someone gave me the answer I was looking for
---
I watch Tithi, those seem good and nicely edited and there’s a lot
---
I mean are you sure that’s because you’re a scoops Steve or it’s just because that killer specifically was an asshole to begin with and would have done it regardless?
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
Raise awareness!
---
Let's face it, BHVR brought in the Obsession mechanic to give one survivor per trial built-in crutches. As if they didn't already have enough crutches.
---
Think of all the stupid shit that killer obsession perks do. What moronic dev thinks out loud that a killer's perk should depend on the killer not killing a survivor. What logical person that claims to champion "balance" says to himself "the power of this perk should protect one survivor and/or even enhance the ability of that one survivor in case the killer targets the survivor."
---
There isn't one survivor perk that has the qualifier: 
---
* "Grants the killer extra bonus speed"  
---
* "Slows down the remaining survivors"
---
* "Increases the action speed of the killer by 33%"
---
* "Adds extra hooks for the killer*
---
* Slows progress speed down by 5%*
---
Not one. Why the fuck does any killer perk HELP another survivor?
---
There should be no downside to going after the obsession, any obsession, for any killer obsession perk. Take for example Dying Light - there should be no increased action speed  for the obsession. Why the fuck should the obsession be buffed just because a killer brought in a perk.
---
The dev who thought of that is a low skilled survivor main and a disgrace as a developer.
---
Hitting the survivor when you have STBFL should NOT take away your tokens, it should do nothing - not give you tokens and not take them away. You should only get tokens when hitting someone not the obsession. 
---
Hitting, downing, or hooking the obsession should not take away your tokens with PWYF. You should be able to chase after them, get your tokens, then down them and hook them without losing anything. 
---
And I already mentioned how stupid Dying Light's obsession buff is. That obsession should get no action speed buff whatsoever.
---
Rancor should not give the obsession aura reading after every gen. That's ridiculous. It's a damn killer perk.
---
And most of all, and this goes for all obsession perks... killing the obsession should NOT MAKE YOU LOSE ALL YOUR TOKENS. That's the dumbest aspect of them all. Every single one of them should keep the tokens that was there at the time of the obsession's death, with the killer not being able to increase said tokens unless he gets another obsession.
---
BBQ (Leatherface) is the most important perk in the game.  You earn BP twice as fast.
---
I find Myers and Freddy to be the most entertaining.  They’re also strong.
---
It can definitely be a toxic environment. But for as many angry/salty killers and survivors I’ve seen, I’ve also encountered great killers who will let the last guy go, or survivors that let you get in a final hit before they escape.
---
As a killer, I’ll always let the good guy go, especially if his team was doing nothing all game. If I’m chasing a guy around for 3-4 minutes and the team doesn’t do a single gen, I’m going to let him go and absolutely murder the other 3.
---
survivor: *vaults back at double Legions speed while they swing and cancel their power*
---
Right back at you buckaroo
---
He hasn't completed a Bloodweb on Trapper since the moonlight/mist offerings were removed from the game.
---
Love it, 11 out of 10 stars.
---
Where is hot sexy Myers cosplay
---
Party because the killer is just an asshole, but some games I would have a killer tunnel me and do hardly anything to other survivors. And a couple games when I wasn’t playing Steve I would other Steve’s get the same treatment. Maybe cause I’m just unlucky or something.
---
I love playing as a rank 15 and getting clapped b/c everyone else is &lt;12
---
Sexy.
---
I don't NEED help, I want help. This is a team effort.

She's glad you like it!
---
nah I got it from a bo4 post, from 2 months ago. So you know how to repost as while
---
Make sure he doesn’t reveal you!
---
I’m in love with discouragement
---
Us blue haired Neas, however, are lovely
---
And every second the killer isn't anywhere near you, he's looking for or chasing someone else. That's almost teamwork - passive teamwork. Save the vitriol for people who actively fuck you over, why don'cha? At least a self-care survivor can eat a hatchet or bodyblock to give you wiggle time.
---
Never seen this before. Wish I have tho
---
I prefer just to get into the game. I acknowledge some games will be unbalanced, that's kind of the nature of dbd anyway. too much rng. so yea, I don't really care
---
I bought the body and legs of scoops and got him to p3 for the bloody face. Now i look like steve at the end of season 3
---
I don't care about it, I'm just making sure scumbags like yourself don't get their way by spamming the subreddit.
---
I actually do agree that making a different information perks base, and then nerfing survivors across the board, (such as adding the Kindred Effect) would be a good idea. 
---
And if they add a second objective, (which they should) it should be able to alleviate the 3 gen problems. I just recently had a game where 5 gens spawned near the street on Badham (More like BadMap, am I right?). The clown couldn't down us, but we couldn't do gens, so the game was a 25 minute slog. I eventually double pipped when I died, but it wasn't fun.
---
It’s not really toxic its just annoying. Flashlight clicking is toxic.
---
Is it me or is the axe the killer holding backwards?
---
I went back and checked, the killer instinct is in the terror radius, so if you want to get better reveals, Distressing or M&amp;A are definitely good perks for it though I wouldn't stack both.
---
Distressing adds 8 meters to the terror radius all the time, making it hard to sneak up on survivors but doubles the points you get for landing hits in Feral Frenzy. I wouldn't recommend this perk however, since Legion doesn't need the point multiplier all that much. They get a bunch of Deviousness points on their own.
---
Moniter &amp; Abuse is for sure better since it lowers the Terror Radius out of chase, making it easier to sneak up on survivors and when landing the Frenzy hit, it adds the same 8 meters to your terror radius that Distressing does.
---
Oh it is
---
Outstanding move
---
The best part is if the legion did get a gun it would fit with their theme
---
But then you reach the highest rankings and wish you were still lower because it’s so easy to win...
---
Nancy wheelers titties are so tiny I just want to take her with a and have her run around with no bra just panties and get Susie passed out drunk
---
I'M NO LONGER PLAYING THIS GAME ANYMORE! HOWEVER I WILL STILL LURK AND WATCH COMFORTABLY FROM THE SIDELINES HOW BADLY THE RECENT BALANCE CHANGES WILL AFFECT COMMUNITY MORALE &amp; THE EVER-METASTASIZING TOXICITY LEVELS OF THIS COMMUNITY!
---
As far as I know, since 'Stranger things' you need to double-pip as survivor as well.
---
I don't know how to respond to this.

Thanks for responding :3

man i wish i could do this on ps4. fking nice job

I stay in low ranks and I only saw 2 this month with around 10-15 games played a day

&gt;DS gets buffed to where the timer pauses if a survivor gets slugged    
---
&gt;one survivor farms another off the hook, slug the person who got unhooked because I feel bad for them    
---
&gt;hook 2 other people in under three minutes    
---
&gt;go back to the slugged survivor with BBQ's aura reveal    
---
&gt;get DS'd, get teabagged at the gates by that one survivor    
---
&gt;"ggez shouldn't have tunnelled"
---
Nooooo I was so excited :(
---
Dude it’s like they didn’t even try lmao
---
imagine prefering to wait a long ass time to play killer because of some slight lag
---
I believe this is the case until multiple people are on the same Gen, then it becomes increasingly better to tap if you cannot hit greats.
---
They just threw models on it and called it a day
---
Ok sorry I just had one of those games three times in a row yeah im a bad killer. Again I am sorry for wasting every one's time and I'll think more clearly next time something bad happens
---
I'm Sorry.
---
Vaguely concerned this would fragment the queues and make rank take even longer. But crossplay feels like a pretty real solution.
---
Although ranks really should have a reward.
---
I wait 10 min for killer matches and still end up crushing the survivors. If I'm not going to get balanced matches, at least make them faster.
---
I've been looking for something like this! I love lore videos for other games, even ones I don't play. I'll definitely check it out.
---
Everyone suggests that, but that wouldn't solve any problems. It will split the population in half, and likely slow queues even more than right now. This game simply doesn't have the numbers to split it up into separate queues.
---
As someone who just did the adepts last week, you do not
---
I've said some toxic shit before that blows your "ching-chong" out of the water. You'll be fine.
---
Unhook your friends before they die!
---
As an experiment, yes.
---
The skill check are bullshit, even in the best case scenario. One way to get more accurate hits is to focus on the timing between the sound queue and the predetermined skill check locations. I am inclined to agree with /u/PokerSvk here. It seems like the gen skill checks are considerably worse than the healing skill checks. If the skill checks were fixed, Hex: Ruin would become almost worthless at red ranks, and I think that's the reason they haven't fixed it yet. Failed Hex: Ruin skill checks are currently a major contributing factor to the balance of the game.
---
That's a pretty barf response to someone being salty over losing.  Generally I would be on your side, but you decided to throw some Adam Sandler style racism at them.
---
You probably won't catch a ban for it, but I really hope you do.  There are so many other ways to aggravate or get under someone's skin other than attacking their ethnicity.
---
I mean once you hit red ranks everyone just uses P3 outfits since they hard as fuck to see on some maps.
---
I’m on ps4 however my internet companies are in need of an ass kicking so I haven’t been online in a few weeks. But soon I will return with proper connection.
---
The other day I was given hatch at the end and the killer said “Scoops = Hatch” lol
---
TRY LOOPING WINDOWS YOU MEGHEAD
---
No source? Fuck off.
---
Oh so you're approaching me?
---
I don't understand why you would drop a match simply due to one add on so she can down you with a hatchet throw but she either has 1 or I think 2 or 3 if she uses another add on meaning she cant mess up nearly as much without reloading
---
I really don't understand why I got so many down votes on that whatever
---
Imagine making an account to say that
---
Thank you, I'll save this comment for later
---
The tutorial has basic bots. I feel like they could improve them for a basic training mode. Even if it was just an empty field to test Killers / perks on.

"I'm not racist, my brain just slipped up because of spongebob so I said something racist"
---
What?
---
Is that really a thing?
---
Wait...that’s illegal
---
that wouldnt solve anything tbh - people will get split up even more.
---
Ranks should just have some sort of impact, other than "playing with better people"
---
More like preferring to wait for 10 minutes for a 30 minute match instead of 5 minutes for a match that's done in 3.

I noticed that.

He has no pressure, and he's slowed down while using his only tool
---
I love it! Send the idea to them if you haven’t!
---
Because he was such a loveable character in season 3 and people who buy that outfit tend to be big fans and it’s kind of a sadistic sort of fun killing a character you know people love

I knew it looked familiar! Glad someone else noticed it as well

25 kill streak bonus
---
LMAOOO
---
True, but it doesn't put any pressure on the killer to NOT mess up. They can reload from a locker before the scratches even begin to fade. They can hurl the bloody things from point-blank range without slowing thselves down as much as a melee hit. It's a straight upgrade with no real tradeoff, just like instaheal.
---
Lovecraft was in line with his time. Regardless personal beliefs does not lessen the impact he has had on the horror genre.
---
Are you filming through a prism? The hell is with the streaks?
---
So don't do it, yeah it's not worth it, that's kind of the point, but it's still an option.
---
If you are using the rainbow map, only use addons that extend range or increase the duration/ reduce burn rate. The rainbow map already has the ability to track everything.  
---
If you are using a normal map, you should take red twine and stamp. The red twine says it allows the map to track the killers belongings, which include the following: Hooks, bear traps, phantasm traps, chests, totems, jigsaw boxes. The way the map works is that you have a radius around you at all times (8 meters default). If an object that is track-able enters the radius you receive a bloodpoint award for map scout and the item is added to the map. Once you've scouted an item, it's aura will appear to you when you channel the map. A lot of people will start burning their maps right away looking for ruin, but it doesn't do you any good if you haven't scouted any area yet. Additionally, you'll know as new things are added to the map because of the bloodpoints that pop up. You can use this to find things even if your map's charge is depleted, assuming you have enough map knowledge.  
---
Another great thing about red twine is that it makes you a ton of bloodpoints back via scouting. Since it scouts hooks and totems, you can get a ton of extra points passively while you are running around.
---
Yo! Sorry I completely overlooked your reply the other day T_T 
---
Pm me if you want some more ideas thrown around lol. Always fun to talk spirit
---
I do the same when someone instant heals.
---
The Hair was too cool for them.

Nice. The only comment I had was to slow down a bit, especially when there are commas and periods, otherwise it sounds like a run-on sentence. 
---
I just noticed that Benedict says in the end that if they find him to bury his body. That doesn’t make sense if he already knows death is not really death and you always come back.
---
not funny didnt laugh

I dont find much success playing Michael, and i am a pretty good killer

I know its an unpopular opinion but i sincerely believe Michael is somewhat underpowered right now

Im sorry for this post

Ah bummer, thanks for reply.

Not having good map coverage is a huge problem, he can't be considered one of the best as a result

Omegablink mains.
---
Nurse will still be the most deadly killer in the game by a long shot, and a broken design at her very core. Nurse mains (xD) can be glad that the actual fundamental flaws of her base kit were left completely untouched. Good players win the vast majority of their matches with any killer; the killer mains crying about how survivors are unbeatable and only Nurse can ever hope to win are pathetically bad players.
---
I didn’t say nerf or buff anyone? I just said if you are good enough with plague no additional buffs or nerds are needed. Not judging this person at all. I hate how reddit always looks at things in the wrong way or in a negative way.
---
Awesome thank you! I also wondered more about what he meant by that it sucks that there isn't more about his story, maybe soon!
---
Or healing speed to trump Nurse's detection perk.
---
I really don’t blame you
---
An easy fix if she is low tier-  make the sickness actually effect repair speeds or something, maybe making them slower while running if they vomit 
---
Survivors would have a bigger reason to cleanse now

Make sure to bring the Ultra Rare Add-On that auto-downs people who free themselves. Unless one of them has Unbreakable, you will actually win that way if they ever leave the lockers :D
---
Yes!
---
While not technically a DBD “cosplay” since I’m wearing my 2018 Myers mask, I got this pic of one of my Myers costumes just as the fog machines went off.
---
Understandable
---
I understand where you are going with  this however I play both sides killer and survivor huntress is very slow and some maps make landing even 1 hatchet damn near impossible DS is way more balanced than it was before so not really targeting  that so I guess I'm wondering if you drop every game that the killer has a 1 shot ie ghost face Myers Billy I understand huntress is a pain w that add on but what else does she have. Insta flashlights are purple with pink bulb annoying as fuck
---
&gt; Exhaustion perks don't go against the game's design. Most of the time an exhaustion perk won't even help you break line of sight for any period of time. Not to mention Bloodlust. 
---
You're not quite getting the point and I don't think you will ever concede that survivors are still OP. It doesn't matter if a perk like Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing or Sprint Burst doesn't "break line of sight" when the point is to escape and get to more pallets or a loop spot. And do these greatly assist if not CARRY players into getting away for free? Yes, they certainly do. But your piddly ass will never admit to that in a million years and instead you will whine and cry about Iridescent Head Huntress, or Pinky Finger Clowns, Instant Saw Billy and etcetera and etcetera.
---
I didn’t say you said anything you just implied that she doesnt need a buff or nerf because of one person in particular who happens to be one of the best killer mains in the game
---
Wrong subreddit amigo r/dbdgonewild is here
---
Do you know if the perk lights up still while looking in the direction of the killer? I get that the aura is blocked, but I'm interested to see how it works.
---
SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS
---
To be fair, I don't think it's 'nasty' or 'toxic' for survivors to avoid being slugged when bringing DS, by hiding in a locker. It's pretty much a fair usage of game mechanics.
---
And seems Trapper has a hilarious effective counterplay for that :D
---
Anytime papi ;)
---
Unfortunately, most people just go super immersed until Corrupt is gone. :(
---
She slows down on wind up and already runs really really slow
---
Was this on dedicated servers? I thought if killer quits then the whole match goes down
---
He's not my favorite but I wouldn't DC against him
---
I agree, maps like The Game have so many marks in yhe walls from survivors ducking around one of like nine billion corners and dodging the throw. But it's still too powerful. Status effects as hatchet addons, sure, but not instant down.
---
You definitely have to focus on one area at a time with him, some of his add ons can make that area bigger/increase pressure. I agree that he's not the most powerful but he rewards skill and preparation and punishes carelessness plus has some great mind game ablilities. As far as map pressure goes, you only really have to keep 3 gens safe and get hooks in the mean time to win (i know, I make it sound so easy).
---
Had a Myers who was obviously just there for the daily.  Once I realized what was going on I just stood there and let him stalk me.
---
Once he realized I was friendly he started following me around the map.  I yelled for my family to come see the baby Myers I had adopted.
---
After the gates were open he ran out with us like he was going to escape too.  Last game of the night after a brutal day of grinding survivor, made me realize why I love this game.
---
Edit:my English was not strong on this post.
---
I'm always the Claudette w/ Plunderers finding 3 keys a game.
---
Honestly, if the OP doesn’t post the source then someone else does it for them, do you think they’re still liable to be reported for stealing content like that?
---
Pretty sure the person had DS, so he couldnt grab her out the locker without being stunned. But you can use lockers to avoid hits but its very rare you make it out alive. But definitely can waste a good 20 seconds by going in and out a few times
---
&gt;So what? If you take every group and solo players is a 50% split. Just because less people are 4 man swf doesn mean 3swf and 2swf doesn't exist
---
Nowhere do I say that 2 and 3 swf groups do not exist but they are not a problem. Unless it's a 4 man group of best players they are not the ones you'd balance the game around, so even in this idealistic 50% split you aren't balancing around the target group. It's like balancing survivors around them playing vs omegablink Nurse.
---
&gt;Plus, they play casually, so what? Even in league of legends most people play casually. The same can be said to Tekken, cs:go and so on. It's not the point
---
&gt;ANY pvp game MUST balance the game towards top players
---
Balancing around the top players while definitely benefitting the pro experience does nothing positive for the casual playerbase. Multiple characters in League are despised by the general playerbase while being ignored by the balance department due to their non-existant competetive presence, gameplay changes geared towards aspects of the game a casual player doesn't even think about but that affect them negatively because of it hurt the player experience.
---
Games like CS:GO, Dota, etc. at least have reasons to get better at the game, there are professional teams that give chances to players who play seriously. You can get money for taking part in tournaments in Fortnite. Here there is literally no reason to get better, if anything it actually hurts you to rank up since you will be getting longer Qs and worse match quality.
---
&gt; make it balanced so nothing can be abused in a fair competition, in a tournament or just with friends
---
There is no competition or actual tournaments for this game, so what's the point? Plus you can't really make things not broken in an asymetrical game, there is no game that has ever done that. One side will end up better than the other in some way, and there will be broken things. To try and remove all the bs from the game you'd have to rework the entire game from the base.
---
&gt;"Nobody should take this game seriously". Okay now depends on what do you mean with seriously! If that was true people wouldn't DC Everytime something don't go their way
---
I said nobody should, not that nobody does. Yes there are people who take this game too seriously and the example you have given is a part of that.
---
&gt;rank won't exist and so on.
---
I and many other players think rank doesn't matter and that it shouldn't be cared about, but some people will care about it. Doesn't mean they should.
---
The point of there being a ranking system is to prevent very new and unexperienced players from being matched with people who know what they are doing so that the quality of the match is decent as you get people from relatively close level together. It isn't a perfect system in the slightest but it's overall objective works most of the time.
---
The Nurse cosmetic is part of the rift. Progressing through the premium pass will unlock the full Nurse outfit and a bunch of other stuff
---
I always thought you have to run into the killer so he can carry you to the trap door!
---
The Halloween one?
---
You have to get the new battlepass when it comes out
---
either what u/rafial23 said or because of a glitch currently which treats the killer leaving as YOU leaving (mainly on ps4)
---
Depending on perks, yes. But healing yourself is way more benefit to the team than running around leaving a blood trail to each gen you work on. Need I remind you that there's a killer perk that makes generators take extra regression from getting hit?
---
I'm pretty sure chain sawing someone is supposed to kill them too, but apparently it just makes them unable to walk
---
“Daryl Dickson” lol that’s great
---
Yeah it's the same with Doctor. Those 2, along with Hag and arguably Demo, have the best 3 gen strat capabilities in the game. However, having to rely on good gen placement to secure the 3 gen isn't good, and neither is letting the game get to that point in general tbf.
---
I'm pretty sure does take  her in particular to long as her base run speed is lower maby if they made the one hit only work for fully charged hatchets it would be better
---
They should.
---
A good way to tackle these achievements is to do them during rank reset against potato survivors
---
There are no lockers here sir
---
I believe the game is design the way it is to promote as much interaction as possible between the players. In its current form DBD is fun to play even after it's no longer scary. The problem with making games more focused around horror is that the fear response begins to diminish as the players are continually exposed to the same stimuli. Once you have played a game for hundreds of hours, is what remains fun to play?  
---
That said, I would love for stealth to be a more viable option in the game than it currently is. I think I get where you are coming from with this. There is a certain exhilaration that comes from the anticipation of being discovered while hiding. In the current version of the game, a good killer will always find you quickly if the game doesn't bug out and fail to place scratch marks or something. It would be nice to have more options for strategies while playing. Having to choose the best option in a given scenario would raise the skill cap, and having options would give the matches more variety.
---
I don't shame a survivor for pulling them off a totem, however, if after they are saved from the hook I go back to my totem and see them on it again, still wounded, then I will slap them down and shake my head.  If they don't immediately DC (many do) I leave them on the ground to contemplate what they've done.  If they do immediately DC... yay for me?
---
Damn, I never thought about it that way. Ya got me.
---
Ha ha yeah
---
Can you imagine Shaking Fingers, Hex:Ruin, and Distressing? Need this
---
NAAAAAAAAAANCYYYY fam  
---
bold of you to show your face again
---
Oh, got it. 
---
Any word on when that pass comes out? It looks like a cool cosmetic, and since I'm leveling the nurse, it will give me a reason to actually use her.
---
The archives + blight event drops on the 22nd!
---
someone post a video of that  time ago, was that u?
---
Remember the time when they experimented with the match making couple of months ago?
---
I never had such a fast lobby at 11p.m. (\~3min)when you normally wait &gt;30min. in Germany at this time. Sure it was unbalanced, but boy was it fast.
---
I would say you should be able to choose what you want and in the end the "magic-mathematican match making mechanic" would merge them together.
---
Can't say I've ever had to play against a Pinky Finger Clown. Instant Saw Billy can't down me over a generator from across the map, though. 
---
I pointed out breaking line of sight because it helps ditch the bloodlust stacks, that make looping have one inevitable end. It's all abput delaying tactics when you're in a chase, you agree? So ending a chase from twenty metres back with no effort is clearly worse than a perk that requires you to get hooked first. I mean shit, DS is a bit too good, I admit, but at least killers can just count in their heads until it's safe. You can't do shit against Iridiscent Heads except get lucky with the map, or run Unbreakable and hope you get slugged.
---
Balanced Landing definitely needs a drop/height limit though, it shouldn't work by dropping down the staircase in The Game maps.
---
I'm not concerned with survivors or killers being "OP". That's not what we're discussing. We're talking about an addon, dude.
---
I have spent hundreds of bucks on a game that I’m not even that good at on meaningless skins for characters I don’t even play. 
---
I ain’t flexing, I’m just showing everyone I’m dumb and bad with money
---
Agreed, I would put Freddy up there with them. Dream projection and snares can work wonders late game.
---
HES ON FIRST HOOK! DO THE 4%!
---
From brand new you're probably looking at at least 50 hours of learning before you hit red rank; and that's if you're pretty good at games to begin with. Rank is pointless in this game though, so just have some fun in the fog.
---
Yeah great skill checks are like that for me too
---
That'd be somethong, at least. Or heck, let it down people at any charge level/amount, but force her to stand still.
---
True, I prefer pallets to snares though, way more headfucky.
---
Depends on your skill level. On average it takes about a year though, but red ranks isnt fun at all. Enjoy your time in the greens and grays.
---
i heard it drops the 22nd along with the event tbh i like the wraiths cosmetic it looks like a dark souls character
---
Ah thank you, now i know its JoJoeJoey
---
It's performance based and shouldn't be a "goal" rather a reflection of how you've been playing. 
---
As rank goes up you also play much better players and it gets much more difficult. 
---
Making rank 1 a main goal leads to toxic behavior such as; getting ultra salty and spamming the killer after the match. Taking the game WAY too seriously and raging when you die... and the worst offense, being a toxic t-bagging Disconnector anytime a killer catches you and might de-rank you.
---
Remember, DC'ing will also falsely inflate your skill... so you might be a "true" Rank 10 playing as a Rank 1, with &amp; against rank 1-5's and it'll show! You'll rage even more often because you're not there yet.
---
So my two cents... just enjoy the game and make the rank a reflection not a goal. That said, if you play well, play regularly, and git guud, anywhere from 2-3 months probably.
---
I did that too, it was fun!  
---
Was also my first day running DS, so I was happy I got a chance to use it.
---
I can't bring myself to give up the snares, I just like the flexibility of them. I really wish there were an add on which gave you just a few of both.
---
I think that Vengeance would be a pretty funny perk. I don’t know how good it would be though.
---
You got us on the first half ngl
---
I think I've still got an old forum answer from Behavior answering this, if you're interested I can look through my images for it
---
As you walk towards the hook, give them "the nod". Move your camera up and down repeatedly as you walk.
---
Bold of you to even show your face at all after what that Activia did to poor Laurie, turned her into a horse!
---
its like a fun strategy game to guide it to choosing the most pricey items for you, especially when it chooses a choke point
---
Make turret them now bad idea but could be bullied really hard on some maps
---
I was trying to Adept Plague last night, but Plague just struggles very hard at getting good emblem scores many of the 4Ks I got were only Brutals (no pip). 
---
I think you need to get a small map for Plague so she can better pressure the gens since her base perks and power do very little to stop gens from getting done very quickly which is what really hurts gatekeeper.
---
Chaser is pretty hard to get good emblem score as you lose out on points for only hitting survivors once. It honestly feels like the best way to get good chaser is just to not use Vile Purge unless survivors end up cleansing and you can get Corrupted Purge and get short chases where you hit survivors twice that way.
---

I was starting to wonder why Killers were bringing more moris after I bought the outfit.

Well then you clearly care if you're using free time to screech about people posting a streamer who plays the game this subreddit is based on instead of doing, I dunno, literally anything else?
---
How the fuck does a 3K give you a depip at Rank *12*?
---
I am very sad at rank reset. I get to rank 1 as killer, but sadly it’s not the same story as survivor. I’ve just now got all the good teachables as survivors and it’s rough out there
---
I would rather DC
---
The correct answer
---
Where’d you get the costume?
---
No joke first time I ran into him has been my biggest jumpscare...  ...was a killer
---
I would assume it's just a bundle of all of the OC characters with the base game for $30-40 plus an exclusive cosmetic.
---
Curious about this as well. Just saw it on Leaks. I seriously doubt they would make a new edition of the game just for Quentin's face though. If that happens, it'll just be in an update, or DLC.
---
Maybe the game with past DLC included? Who knows!
---
The myeress
---
Yeah im such a selfless killer 😏
---
Low-key new Freddy is god damn s tier. I’ve only lost like 4 games with him since he was reworked
---
I agree with what you're saying. But it can be so satisfying to force the gen. Even more of a thrill if you can do it with out Noed, which is honestly just a waste of a perk slot most times.
---
Ok this was average until the new panel now is 10/10
---
When the entity is puffin his juul
---
Would you say indentity V is also a knock off? I played it once and honestly it's really the same god damn thing except for the quality
---
That's a fair and valid opinion,
---
but to me does not change a thing about it being a valid use of game mechanics. It's not toxic to play the game with whatever is the most effective meta at any given time.
---
If they were exploiting glitches or whatever, sure. But using perks, as they are inside the game, is not, to me, toxic.
---
DC then cry.
---
That’s a misleading description, I thought the chilly made me faster
---
*Now I have a machine gun, ho ho ho*
---
It would be too straight forward and one sided, especially since as a base she's faster than the player, That would make looping her impossible and her encounters more annoying than they already are. I wanted to add more interplay
---
The trick is to do a last second change to Steve so they don't have the time to equip a mori
---
Shows you where the obsession is when you mind channel
---
Where is the floating bandages LUL
---
No Matter what anyone says there's going to be someone out there who's going to call you toxic and be a dick about it, don't think to hard about it and what they say
---
Wow, I haven't seen this meme format in years. The nostalgia is real
---
If a killer is camping somebody on a hook, generally the signal to show that is by spamming the escape attempt but not following through. 
---
Then everybody else will see the beginning animation spammed and know something is up.
---
Being rescued after having a hook through your shoulder should kill you too
---
Depends how quick the reaction time from that survivor is. Either you hit the survivor and gets slammed a pallet and stunned, or you just Shred the pallet. Completely nullifying the fact that you have to break the pallet either or after using Shred kinda guaranteeds a good followup in most cases. It also allows for some pretty unexpected plays even if you are lunging through a pallet around a corner for example. It is 100% better than Enduring alone if you play your cards right the majority of the time.
---
Mind game potential really isn't important as forcing Survivors to have to take alternate paths and good loops on most maps are NOT close to eachother.  Legion's problem is that he can be looped, most loops are unsafe and being able to block GOOD loops is massively important.  This is why Billy, Nurse and Spirit are good because they can just BREAK THROUGH loops and all that.
---
It isn't "Hurting" you at all, if anything it's a pretty clear way to stop infinites which is something Legion REALLY struggles with.
---
Also, practically all killers are low tier, that doesn't mean they don't work they just aren't defacto busted like Billy, Spirit and Nurse.
---
And finally, Bamboozle does not mean you can't mindgame, you don't HAVE to block EVERY window, it just means you can.  Options are important.
---
Is this homemade or bought?
---
Yeah but Bubba can’t **ZOOM**
---
Yes,
---
Does awareness effect the killers TR
---
When you are pissed and annoyed get the fuck off he game instead of just irritating yourself.
---
Try reading the Entity's language on the older cosmetics and items.
---
Why not just keep bringing it, sure one time perks are risky but you gotta stick with it. You can't expect it to work the first time or every round. Sometime it works sometime it doesn't, you can't blame the killer aswell since survivor gen rush so fucking quick even with ruin
---
Lol at low ranks people think that’s a cry for help.
---
That has nothing to do with chainsaws tho thst had to do with hillbillys super fast legs so bubba wins chainsaw noises
---
You got it wrong she's not that fat
---
I NEED A BUTTON THAT LETS ME FOOKEN KICK SURVIVORS IN THE FACE WHEN THEY TRY TO UNHOOK ME IN FRONT OF KILLERS.
---
Don't fix toxic with toxic, if someone plays toxic towards you, don't take it out on other random players, it will just make everyone run OP shit and no one will be having fun.
---
if you get them in your next game though...
---
I like your outfit
---
Speaking of which when is DBD gonna be released on mobile? They said by the end of the year.
---
You got me
---
When I play killer I make sure that the Scoops ahoy Steve’s survive. They must be protected at all costs.
---
I blame streamers for this honestly. Since beta it was always camping
---
I love the RBT
---
Prove thy self is also a good BP generator, especially when run with an aura perk that helps you find other survivors. 
---
Outside of that, as mentioned above, we're gonna live forever is great. Because the unhooks have to be safe, it also encourages you not to play like a potato. 
---
With WGLF even while learning the game, and getting killed pretty regularly I was still averaging 20-30k BP.
---
Should have taken the picture with an old digital camera
---
If you're playing both killer and survivor, you'll pick up on a lot of etiquette things pretty quickly. You can play however you'd like, but if you find something isn't fun for you, then chances are that someone else feels the same way.
---
Common complaints are with tunneling (chasing one survivor over and over until they are dead), camping the hook when someone is hooked, teabagging at pallets, flashlight spamming. Everyone has their own list, so don't try to make everyone happy. It's going to be impossible for every player to enjoy every match.
---
While everything above except for teabagging could be considered a part of the gameplay, it just makes for a crappy experience for the other person. Things like tunneling and camping also don't work well in most cases if you want to win. That said, kill someone if you need to, use that flashlight to save someone or blind the killer. You probably want to win no matter which side you're playing, and you shouldn't go easy on the other side if you don't want to.
---
The most important part is that you enjoy playing, but it doesn't hurt when others enjoy the game as well.
---
Susie cosplay everyone, actually. It's the #1 most common cosplay I have seen related to dead by daylight.
---
One of the best tho, so 👍
---
Yeah, Michael it's kinda scary, but he's not realistic by any means.  Ghostface, thought, has a factor that makes him extremly scary for me: he's a normal, nice dude with a simple life. It could be your sister, or your uncle, or your friend, or that dude you saw in a bar 4 years ago...
---
Dark sense and bitter murmur are under rated
---
\-tantly creepy
---
I twitch my hands to signal killer is camping and do the unhook animation for when it's safe to unhook.
---
Spirit’s like 20, it’s ok.
---
Self care
---
There’s another app called Identity V. It’s very handicapped. Kind of expected for younger players
---
It's a tough match between this and gone before 6
---
If its only you and another survivor left alive and the killer is clearly using you as bait, if you see the other survivor spamming crouch over and over that typically means they've found the hatch and want you to kill yourself.
---
Omae wa mou....shindeiru*
---
Myc?
---
I feel dumb
---
Super cool cosplay my guy, you nailed it
---
Judith's Tombstone, Fragrant Tuft of Hair, Play With Your Food, whispers, Ruin, Tinkerer. I normally don't advocate for Ruin but since you'll be spending most of your match trying to get T3 just hope it doesn't get destroyed immediately. Stalk, stalk, stalk and try to get the 3 PWYF tokens as fast as you can to help you during the rest of the match.
---
My SFW played against TydeTyme yesterday and holy were we being dumb. I hope we don't end up in a video
---
Make your choice
---
If someone is on the hook and you're near but afraid to unhook due to being spotted, if you notice someone else on the bottom left gets hit or downed, you're usually good to go and get a free save and heal. You definitely want to go before the hook state changes, otherwise they're dead on next hook.
---
Also, don't attempt escape on hook unless it's 2 survivors left and the killer is chasing the other guy or other desparate situations. Even if it looks like no one is coming right this second, a hook state is a long time and attempting to escape could leave you dead on next hook.
---
Finally, the pink and purple addons are being nerfed very soon. They are significantly better right now, so it's probably a good idea to use whatever you have.
---
22nd of spooktober lasts till 31

cry
---
He got nervous which made it very obvious
---
Lol coming back to this conversation because I literally just finished a Ghostface game in yellow/green ranks (rank reset). On Lery's, I immediately find and hook a guy in the middle basement, then his friends fucking SWARM the hook. So I'm downing and hooking people, two of them DC on the basement hook, I kill one, and let the last leave. And then they accuse me of camping(?) and one says "ur not playing ghostface right ur not stalking!" And when I point out that I killed him, his genius response is "No I DC'd." Survivors are fucking insane!
---
See I personally use Claudette's three teachables and then either DS or Deliverance
---
It’s not that strong first you have to hook 3 survivors   and find a gen which has more then 50% it would be fine it would only work 4 times in game
---
Thank you
---
More often than not, especially at low (red) ranks, spamming means the killer is in close proximity. If they're sitting there doing nothing, that usually means you're good to go for the save.
---
wtf were they filming from my town? Because same
---
It was intentional. You never see ghostface on tier lists
---
The latter. It usually buys at least half a minute at worst, which often helps.
---
I do the former only when I've already had a shit day prior and it's a map like rotten fields or yamaoka. Fuck corn and fuck bamboo.

Death is not an escape

\^
---
For anyone who can't read it-
---
Teachables
---
Born Tracker: Years of practise have honned your tracking ability. Blood left behind by other survivors is much easier to see and lasts 2/3/4 seconds longer than normal.
---
Awareness: Noise is key to tracking. All noise is 5/10/15% louder and easier to pinpoint.
---
Stike back: Your ability to stand strong in the face of danger is outstanding. Pallets thrown down that stun the killer will increase the stun duration by 5/10/15%.
---
Deliverance, decisive strike, we're gonna live forever and prove thyself. That is the one I use and if you do moderately well and get a couple stacks of wglf you can  very well get 40k-50k points a game depending on offerings.
---
Survivor genrush lol
---
I mean... True complains about everything so it's worthless mentioning him.
---
Nah, this list is whack. Leatherface always gets hate mail.... usually cause there so severely punish hook rushing. Doctor's definitely get hate mail because everyone assumes "omg doctor is no skill". Ghostface would be S+ tier lol
---
How so?
---
Wasn't really sure. I mostly use myres and demo
---
He's very fun though isn't he? His power can sometimes be effective by making him mobile, giving him decent detection, and delaying gens through making everyone mend. All in all though, like most killers, he will struggle against good survivors at a high rank.
---
Pssh. Never been discussed. You just use it if no one comes for you really.
---
I just watch YouTube vids while loading as both killer and survivor. It stops boredom from waiting and if I’m a bit salty from a game it calms be down so I’m not gonna be toxic from the salt in the next game.
---
Yh I got no kills as Billy and this meg stayed behind and was pointing at a hook
---
This is cleraly ed sheeran
---
Don't save someone from the hook if the killer is chasing you unless it's a really dire situation or you have the "borrowed time" perk.
---
Don't all of you gang up one one generator. Better to go on different ones. It's quicker and more efficient.
---
Yeah, they've already posted their own stuff here
---
Well then you are not doing a good job if you would to start playing in groups 
---
Map awarness is critical in this game
---
Oh cool, I couldn’t find a post on it myself so thought I’d leave something. But I’ll keep this up for anyone who might not have seen it as well :)
---
Joe mama, lul, that's all i can think of
---
They posted it literally less than 1 hour ago
---
Demo is as loud as a chainsaw tho
---
How do you think us survivors can run forever?
---
This list is whack.
---
I don’t know even know how that happened lol. Here’s the [sauce ](https://youtu.be/pF4159PR9rY)for a second time
---
So why did you delete it then?
---
If you get reported enough yes
---
Okay well I didn’t see it
---
That’s a fat rip
---
How about this, next time a Scoops Steve is in my lobby I bring a mori and kill everyone else with it and give Steve hatch.
---
if survivors don’t know that everyone is good to escape (say their teammates are at the other door) they’ll often stay in the exit areas to force the killer to hit them out and waste time or to stay in the match in case their teammates need help if the killer leaves the gate and gets someone else down. it’s not always just to taunt the killer but definitely can be.
---
No. You can not.
---
How much is enough?
---
I’ve been reported twice
---
It’s a hag and the Mori is them trying out some flavors
---
please stab me with the knife.
---
 please
---
They can't though, because it's literally *not* reportable. The devs have clarified this multiple times.
---
No you can’t be banned for camping
---
lol geez murder and rape threats. i dont get why ppl dont set messages to friends only. arent u uncomfortable playing a competitive mp game with chat set to anyone?
---
By existing
---
I love playing against Myers as a survivor. He is super scary
---
Yes but Billy gets to zoom across the map, spreading his chainsaw noises to everyone
---
*N O*
---
Ironic that Tru3 always cries about how survivors can't adapt and always beg for nerfs and then turns around and begs for nerfs lol
---
Lmao they're already calling for Nerfs to Huntress Billy and spirit now that nurse is being gutted. I play Both Sides equally and since I'm criticizing this rework... I love getting downvoted and called a killer main. Never mind the fact nurse won't have any map pressure on big Maps or indoor maps anymore. Since she still has the slow speed and the fatigue plus the cool-down timer. Sucks all of the big streamers and YouTubers just use her best add-ons and say she was fine when the average player doesn't have the blood points or time to use the best add-ons every match. Killers shouldn't be add on dependent.
---
 And I hate seeing comments like yours getting downvoted for no other reason than survivors hating killers they can't Loop like anyone else. Hating variety of gameplay like what Spirit or nurse bring to the table. Killers that force you to play stealthily and avoid chases.
---
correct, then go back to leveling up Nea to make it appear in her bloodweb
---
Yeah I’ve had the same shit said man. Not about inventory but something else. People will just find a excuse to pin on you.
---
I use it hahahha
---
Ignore them. Most SWFs share a single brain cell and act as toxic and idiotic as possible in the post game chat, win or lose.
---
Hell no there’s no validity, just assholes trying to act cool in-front of friends. Just try and enjoy playing the game and don’t take to heart what people say when they are hiding behind a screen. And if you run into them again run NOED and a mori so they have a reason to bitch at you 😂😂
---
I bought him cause the masochist part of me likes the long chase even if I'm going to be noed at the end of it
---
Yeah, also thinking about being in a reverse bear trap is pretty scary.
---
They are just trying to scare you I get people on console telling me they are gonna report me cause I have wall hacks ( I don’t ) and etc. I don’t think you should worry
---
He sure as shit doesnt mock anyone are you serious?
---
I think you get extra BP for being in the match longer
---
I’m al good for bring a mori for mori sake but when u just target someone for a cosmetic it’s different
---
I only mori bad people you really want me to-
---
No thanks. Bloodlust is already a stupid mechanic, and giving the killer perma bloodlust with increasing tiers every 5 seconds would just cause every obsession to insta DC and kill the game. I know I would
---
No, I did double pip and got it in a later game but my friend didn't when he got it
---
Second this dude.
---
seriously this, it's clearly so bullshit but if you're actually getting worried you might wanna get yourself checked out
---
He payed for someone to make it but provided the materials and put together the costume
---
PS4
---
Yeah true. I don’t really target anyone though usually.
---
It's a hint, CLU2 is the killer and Flynn is the survivor.
---
It's a game dude. If it's making you like that I wouldn't play for a while. If you didn't cheat the fuck All is done. But some time away from the game might do you okay, but I'd get professional advice buddy
---
How u do dis
---
Thanks, it’s pretty good in those situations.
---
DBD may not but if they report you through steam that's a different story.
---
Wglf (david king perk) is a must for the (up to) double bloodpoints.
---
Prove thyself (dwight perk) will max out your objective after a little more then 1 gen if done with another.
---
Small game will help you get a pile of boldness with out you needing to be good with pallets or looping.
---
Oddly enough, my last tip is...  PUG.  I find SWF is detrimental to my bp/hour gain (by almost 50%), even though i 'win' more and earn higher bp per match.  Swf only shines for bp during events when everyone burns offerings.  During events definitely SWF.
---
Pigs little saw blade
---
nurse
---
and has a 32m terror radius and a red glow... yeah sure man
---
I only hopped on to play that one game as a distraction and I regret doing it. I’ve been going through a lot this year but the two of them saying it made me worried as I’ve had this game since 2016 I think and don’t want to lose my account.
---
Still not op
---
I’ve still got my green Styptic in my Ace’s bloodweb.
---
You could probably still pull off the “raining blood” ghostface, rain ponchos can obscure your abdomen and are only about 15$ cut it into whisps and get a ghost mask, then black for undergarments with some rope on the hands and you’re golden, cosplay was invented by fat people don’t be ashamed of your body type, just fix the costume to fit.
---
if this was implemented at the start of the game, it might have been cool. But they cant do that anymore since people already have every perk on some killers and they will now be weaker bc they dont want to lose that all.
---
Also i think it might be a little strange since new players will feel like they are at a disadvantage just bc they did not drop a shit ton of bp into a single killer
---
how the fuck does git gud even make sense here? he literally just said it was annoying, it doesnt even make sense to say git gud. maybe you should git gud at learning when to say git gud
---
Lol thanks I was laughing pretty hard
---
You have good taste. Nice name.
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
---
she virtually ignores all tools survivors have to create distance between killers. Ok top of that, she has crazy mobility and chase potential
---
You won't lose your account man. I won't worry over the game, if there anything you need to talk about hit me up in message. Always hear to listen, stay strong!
---
How can you lose progress after being banned? This doesn't make sense since usually you lose progress by an error during playing and a crash (at least that's how it was happening to others I know)
---
Yeah i just LOVE to wait 5-10 min for a game that will end in 3-5 min ohh and the best ones are those matches where your game ends 5 sek after it starts due to a bug. I swear half of my Steam DBD time is me waiting for a game.
---
*STEVES RISE UP*
---
Survivors shouldnt have stat bonuses, i like playing my mains without having to worry that im playing a super bad character or a meta easy character.
---
as long as the buffs are not that big like an extra trapper trap, i dont think survivors need anything
---
[For anyone who doesn't know.](https://old.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/djann5/new_edition_of_dead_by_daylight_dead_by_daylight/)
---
Clown is super annoying tbh, one of my least fav killers since he feels like huntress baby mode
---
It's a strategy when they have Decisive Strike. You can choose to open the locker and they DS you, or leave them and they just escape. It's to avoid you downing them and leaving them on the ground to avoid their DS going off.
---
It's become so frustratingly common of a tactic that people without DS commonly jump into lockers when they know they lost a chase on the off chance that the killer will just leave, not wanting to deal with the potential of a DS.
---
We were on the new map so I did not know where to look for totems in tier 3
---
Everything in this build seems like an outright heavy nerf, these changes would plummet her down to the absolute bottom of every tier list. The ideas like dropping pallets by chance seem far too rng based and are simply a bad idea for any killer.
---
Thank you :)
---
If they would just stop with adding restrictions to what would be decent perks, we would have a lot more perk diversity. 
---
Fixated should work while injured. Solidarity and Autodidact should work with med kits. Pharmacy should be every chest gives a green med kit. Second Wind should work with deliverance. Diversion should charge in a chase and you shouldn't have to crouch still to use it. Premonition shouldn't have a stupid long cooldown.
---
New killer; The Slug.
---
They are available at spirit and spirit.com as well as straight from the license holders at funworld from their online website, mask will probably cost around 5-10$ sans shipping and if you wanted a full costume it’ll be more like 20-30$ and then shipping, however the fun world costume isn’t the same as the one in the movie scream or the costume from dbd (yet)
---
I blew air from my noise have an upvote
---
She is the only killer able to kill a 4 man swf
---
He's the least toxic DBD streamer I've seen, he literally compliments people who best him all the time and says that they got good plays on him. Complaining about stream snipers using OoO on him all day doesn't make him toxic.
---
He said Bill not Billy, unless he said otherwise before deleting.
---
Call now, and we'll give you an extended mag, for free!
---
Even Claudette runs away! “nope nope nope!”
---
Lol yeah everyone asking about the mask like it wasn’t the most popular Halloween costume for like 8 years straight, these masks will be around after a nuclear apocalypse there are so many.
---
I guess they wanted to derank?
---
I don't know if its a bug or not but when I have one equipped it lets me see the obsession ALL THE TIME (it also makes you less likely to start the trial as obsession)
---
This is insane! I love IT and your concept is crazy as well. DEADLIGHTS also very cool seeing how much effort is put in

Tonight was not my night, 1 tunneler, 1 camper and a game with potato survivors who didn’t rescue me when killer was on the other side of the map. 
---
But yeah, you can have those awesome games which makes this game super fun and then you have ... less fun games.
---
I was in a game with my friend who got hooked and said that he his camera stayed with the Killer, his status in game wasn't hooked and I was unable to unhook him...
---
ingame as in inside the game, In the STORE. Not necessarily while playing.
---
This has happened to me 3 times now and I don't understand it in the slightest since I am solo queue.
---
All ghostface masks are “cheap” unless it’s a special event mask (25th anniversary) or a classic mask that collectors look for, Ive owned lots of masks and as far as the mask part of it goes they all feel the same, as long as they are the official masks and not knock-off cast plastic ones they all are very sturdy and resistant to damage/stains the only thing you may need to replace one day is the attached black shroud as those tend to be made of a low quality costume material.
---
Cheers i will have a look
---
It's a stabby boi!
---
Not too sure which dummies are downvoting you, but what you said is the truth. "don't tunnel" "don't camp" "don't run insta-heal" - How about I play the game the way I want to play it, and you play it the way you want to.
---
I know and its dang good.
---
welcome to dedicated servers
---
The idea i believe came from old Reddit and Steam comments back during the launch and months after, but it has always meant spam M1 (or whatever it is for your platform) to struggle to show "The Killer is close don't save" or the "I am being camped." But some fucking people keep thinking that it's the opposite and keep confusing everyone. At this point if the signal gets mixed and the person goes into struggle or dies on hook, the other survivors are not to blame.
---
Oh God forbid a killer spend the entire match blocking a totem in, how will it ever escape now....
---
spirit, billy, hag, huntress, arguably freddy say hello
---
Or just do it for them sweet survival points.
---
Yes.
---
Why should one be? I think the good times outweigh the bad

You clearly put a hell of a lot of effort into this and it bloody shows! Top notch stuff here mate!
---
It all sounds really really great. Seriously, great work.
---
killers don’t like survivors to have fun
---
It doesn’t need to be fixed?
---
This mask looks like the scream 2 variant with a slightly straighter right eye, mask collectors back me up if I’m correct. Love the costume bro, I knew as soon as someone actually did the proper ghostface costume it would blow up, enjoy that 3.1k upvotes mate!
---
Burn it. What cursed imagery have you brought among us.
---
Oh maybe that's what it does. Never used it
---
set messages to friends only
---
He's done a few more too, all around this caliber although this one is by far my favorite
---
I can still mind channel with it on I just dont NEED to
---
... Is that one survivor just dangling from monkey bars?
---
Yeah, all killers have shitty sensitivity. I'm advocating for having higher one, in that case people won't even think to use mouse while on console in the first place
---
It's not an fps, so precision isn't as important as being able to turn at a decent rate
---
And while you slowly die, not even one gen pops.
---
New technology/hacker killer confirmed.
---
IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME YOU DIE FOR REAL.
---
I just run balanced landing to ignore the mini stun jumping from high places. The speed boost is just an added bonus.
---
Looping isn’t toxic.
---
Legit none of them are good against a 4 man swf wtf are you thinking
---
To the survivors naw unless you have survivors that play killer as well. 
---
But you know I’ve camped a toxic guy before which was good because instead of going into insanity and getting annoyed I was sane and having fun seeing this guy lose lol. 
---
Of course he messages me latter all pissy and I got exactly what I wanted a role reversal lol.
---
well now you have shards to use on something even better next week, save em.
---
Hey, good counter-argument!
---
If it is just a matchmaking preference and not separate playlists, then it wouldn't separate the playerbase.
---
Ohhhh makes sense. Was kinda confused when I read that
---
Yeah, they should implement that. If you wanna see killer powers I'd suggest to look at some guide video of said killer until they actually add a better description in the store
---
Bit new to the game, but normally I main Michael but I thought I’d change it up and I bought freddy. 
---
I start off the game and I think its gonna be hard since its a new killer but it was only hard because of all the toxic crap they pulled.
---
They started the game by gen rushing, then go onto flashlight spamming and pointing at me past pallets. 
---
So I then chose to face camp each and every one of them and got my first 4 kill game with freddy. 
---
I don’t know what the red stuff means, if anyone could explain?
---
I use Morse code sos... I may not be helping
---
I just posted the context to the game, it wasn’t the messages that made it toxic, thats just the icing on the cake.
---
wait insidious on legion? hows that work?
---
Ghostface but the one from the tv show not the game

&gt;Toxic survivor

...
---
&gt;looping
---
You can't be serious.
---
EDIT: Wait, you probably are. I've gotten face camped by low rank killers for prolonging a chase past 30 seconds before. The entitlement and delusion is real.
---
you are just bias and nitpicking. I win. bye bye.
---
Yes it is, how dare survivors enjoy the game!
---
Felt it
---
glad im not the only one.
---
The company that made Identify V actually has been in cahoots with BHVR. https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/cooperation-with-netease-games
---
One hour later healed from Self Care.
---
I'll camp for maybe 10 seconds of me just staring at them. And then I'll fuck off.
---
You got "gen rushed" but also got Iridescent Gatekeeper.
---
[X] Doubt. 
---
Also, this post is against sub rules.
---
Gen rushing isn't toxic.
---
Well first off looping isnt toxic. Second yeah it’s okay if you want to really throw the game because a guy in a video game hurt your feelings.
---
Really? Most i get that are scoops are babies
---
You spelled totem rush wrong.
---
But I usually leave them immediately, and I don't camp people to death. I play a lot of survivor and it's the most infuriating thing.
---
Hey everyone, "racist" here, so look, this thread is becoming really controversial, so tommorow i will delete this, to everyone who saw it... Sorry, i'm wrong, i'm sorry for making fun of something that someone is not guilty of... I deserve it, roast the duck out of me, once again, it's sort of accident, but either way, i'm still wrong, so yea.
---
r/accidentalracism btw
---
Looping isn’t toxic, but if you want to camp go ahead. Nobody can tell you how to play.
---
That's not how that works idiot, you have never played a good 4 man swf if you think those killers can  4 man a 4 man swf, I'm a survivor main and am not biased but I'm tired of them making the game so unfair for killers
---
Thanks bro! Yea, just bought the mask on Ebay.
---
And why is that exactly?
---
This is some “coldsteel the hedgehog” level cringe
---
Camping always makes you seem lame, but do as you wish
---
Oops I read your comment wrong
---
That's y I play killer
---
For sure.
---
Was it a camper for the whole time? Because I know I and other killers will "camp" after all the gens are done and we haven't gotten a single kill. 
---
As for tunneling, on my end it only happens when the person who got unhooked is the only one I can see.
---
I was being constantly harassed by this one dude and well instead of letting him win and have a good time I fuckin put a stop to that lol. 
---
He was a good looper and that’s fine but it just the constant fuckin tbagging lol. I was rusty and I decided eh why let this guy piss me off let’s do the opposite.
---
Understandable have a nice day
---
No
---
Yea, I'm thinking about getting one. Would look cool pretty cool.
---
Same but there was this one guy hence why I said this one guy lol.
---
No, you get nothing
---
On Xbox I had to go to add-ons and download each dlc chapter.  Click start on the game and options popped up.
---
A substitute for gitting gud.  Just about sums it up.
---
It basically said my talents are in the fine arts and that I will accumulate large amounts of property. Honestly, it described me pretty well. Beside the property stuff
---
Can't wait to see it!
---
Probably tree sap
---
Game: 3k
---
Also game: Entity Displeased
---
You're new so you don't know yet but looping isn't toxic.  Like not even a little bit.  It's literally how they're supposed to play you in chases (the good survivors anyway).  As you rank up you'll be facecamping survivors every game if you think looping is toxic.
---
Oh man this sounds amazing, I wish each killer had their own track
---
Because you play to learn bro
---
No it’s not banworthy and absolutely shouldn’t be
---
My dude just delete the game.
---
Thrilling Tremours blocks off all gens that aren’t being worked on when you pick up a survivors land highlighting all the gens being worked on in red
---
I’m all ears reveals the aruas if anyone who fast vaults in a 32 meter radius of you so while in a chase if someone fast vaults a window you can see their arua for a short time perfect for mind games.
---
I was thinking that could be the reason with it being her primary PS4, just seemed strange to me since it's an online game and purchases are attached to your profile.
---
I wasnt trying to be rude. I just used caps to emphasize my point. And it absolutely does not hard counter her lol
---
You just said yourself hard countering is completely negating a power. Iron will doesn't do that. All it does is negate the advantage she normally has on injured survivors. Her power is unaffected, as all she must do is remember they have iron will and always treat them as if they are healthy. 
---
A good spirit is used to using intuition (as well ad being great at following scratch marks etc.) To catch survivors and the vast majority of the time they will not be fooled by survivor trickery.
---
Spirits power is incredibly strong and iron will does not prevent it from being incredibly strong. All it does is, when injured, bring it down from godly (no counterplay) back down to incredibly strong. That is by no means a hard counter in my book. 
---
Also by most definitions a hard counter has nothing that can then prevent that counter from working. However spirit does (stridor) and thus, even by your definition it should most certainly be considered a soft counter. It can help you against the spirit and is a string perk for sure, but it by no means counters her or makes her weak.
---
I should say, if you are escaping more often than dying against rank 1 spirits than YOU are also the exception to the rule. Spirit generally dominates even good survivors assuming the killer knows her well and has a good build.
---
I actually like the power and the perks. Its really interesting.. o:  
---
And im totally in love with the ticking sound! I loved it on the halloween theme 2018. It was so AMAZING. Somehow i love the ticking of clocks. c:
---
I certainly hope you will. You're the kind of bullshit, slur-spewing nincompoop who ruins the game.
---
Meeeee too😤😥
---
I thought it meant "it's safe you can come unhook me"
---
Made more sense to me because the killer can't see when you are asking for help but they CAN see if you are telling them the killer is camping
---
Have you seen how strong survivors are, playing against good survivors is rare but when it happens it's a pain in the ass because it goes from an ok to tough game to a broken losing game for killer. Survivors can easily beat every killer and so like 3 gens in the time it takes the killer to down his first survivor in the first minute of the game, the only killer that can counter this is nurse which makes her a balanced killer, she is getting nerfed a decent bit as well for some reason which I dont understand after playing the game for 1250+ hours I find the nurse fine but all the other killers weak, after all it's a game where you kill or survive, I think the killers should have lots more control than they do and be able to force stealthy gameplay because survivors can just run around, wanna know how to best nurse, hide and dont be a dumb ass. You can easily best a nurse as well if you play well and smart, she is not overpowered, now please get an education before you try to argue that the nurse is overpowered when shes not
---
Good forbid you try to win the game.
---
Lightborn isnt that bad
---
The mask is pretty hot because I also have a balaclava with it, but I got some Heatgear to keep my torso warm.

Everyone since beta.
---
You can do what you want, but it you want to let seasoned players know what's going on, you spam if the killer is close. There's a good chance you're misinterpreting what people on the hook are trying to convey.
---
Get good.
---
That's not an insult, get good at the game and the experience wont be nearly as bad.

The incentive to play survivor is because its fun

Yea, this was in between trials, and the killer just stuffs all us killer in one of the Haddonfield houses. Vacuum man is weird, but he's pretty chill.

This just happened to me too!

I took a video, but it got corrupted somehow... O.o
---
Bruh I dont play nurse she is only level 50 lmao, I play Billy, Wraith, and some others when i feel like screwing around
---
Don’t get found? Running from the killer is literally an intended part of the game
---
Lol, go for it man! I'd love to see a tech wear ghostlike! Also, I didn't make it, but had someone make the coat and hood for me because my sewing skills are near to nothing. The coat is made out of a cotton/linen material.
---
Apparently defending your totem is toxic now, however the same survivor who accused me of ruin camping also accused my dad of molesting me so... even? Lol
---
If you time it right and jump in at the end of a lunge and quickly jump out, it can get you enough time to get to a pallet or window.
---
Like a 360 though, it won't really work twice unless the killer is sub par.
---
&gt;killers make bloodpoints so easy because they really only have 1 objective: to kill. survivors have it separated into 4, gens, healing, chases, and surviving.
---
That's very unfair. Make super simplistic for killer and sound complicated for survivors. I can do the same thing
---
*Killer has to find the survivors, chase, mind game, down them and if everything goes right, hook them. While survivors have to just survive and hold 1 button*
---
See? It's simple do that shit
---
&gt;im not saying decrease the amount of bloodpoints killers make, i understand they need more because they need addons, but survivors can expect to make around 20-25k in a good game, and thats too low.
---
There's a simple reason for that. Killers lose add ons every game no matter what. Survivors can bring any items and keep it as long as they live PLUS retrieve items from the trials itself
---
&gt;its not that easy getting wglf stacks as much as bbq, which both doubles as a bloodpoint perk and a practical perk. survivors need more bloodpoints because the amount you get right now is measly
---
We are gonna farm forever is fine and bbq have the aura reading to incentives people to not stay in the hook
---
Plus bbq have at least 6 counters already.. so call it practical at this point is kinda laughable
---
Make stacks is hard? I use WGLF with borrowed time and have no problem with that, except when the killer is struggling and can't make hooks. So it's difficult only if you are destroying the killer, that's it, which goes both ways since no hooks = no bbq = no WGLF so it's a lose lose lose situation.
---
As survivor I make 40~k per game. I don't think it's too low at all, less than killer sure but since I bring items along too it's not a big deal
---
And I'm rank 4 and the killer uses ruin all the time and it works
---
This one time i found the hatch near the last guy when he was on the hook... he was being camped by a hillbilly and the guy refused to die on the hook so the hillbilly saw me and killed us both

It’s got it’s purpose it’s not a bad perk I put it on my legion to jump through windows real fast
---
I had a match where I found a key in a chest and jumped through the hatch. 
---
The killer immediately closed it, triggering EGC, but the gates didn't get powered because of spaghetti code.
---
The discord call was just full of my swf saying "bruh" and me snickering like the evil entity worshiper that I am as I watched my two remaining allies get impaled.
---
There has to be some motivation to get people to play killer. Otherwise everyone plays survivor and the game dies.
---
Dude same, I'm a survivor main and I see no problem with it. Some survivors are just toxic.
---
Idk. The DBD community picture Myers as a very comedic and overall meme-able killer for some reason. Probably because of OchiDO or Myers’s face looks funny.
---
Also after I died my friend couldn’t die, the killer had to DC to end the game...
---
This would have made a perfect cat meme btw
---
Been trying to prestige all of my survivors lately, so might see some meta perks here since I don't have many perks on them as it is.
---
Also, matchmaking really needs to be fixed. It has been so broken lately.
---
At that moment he decided Neve Campbell must die.
---
More actions need to give Survival because you either get Practically Nothing, 800ish from Struggle, or 5,000 for Escaping.
---
The Obsession Escape &amp; Obsession Death are nice starts but that only gives extra to the Obsession unless you DS to get more Obsessions.

Sweet jesus DS had next to no time left. Nice one.

I was listening to the Halloween '18 soundtrack (which is awesome) but it was making it kinda hard to hear the little ques.

Ok cool just making sure. I’ve noticed people quitting more as I get higher ranked to lmao. I didn’t think I was to good but apparently I’m decent if all these people complain and quit every game. I run the most basic set up to. Usually a trapper sack with one of the coil add ons. My perks are usually some mash up of unnerving presence, deer stalker, iron grasp, agitation, brutal strength, unrelenting, and enduring.
---
You're dad
---
Hit ur greats and it’s almost worthless
---
Not really, theres plenty of people who play killer right now not even for bloodpoints, and we dont even need that many, since in a perfect world there would be 4 times as many survivor players than killers
---
Damn what a missed opportunity, though the market is alittle flooded with those at the moment. Btw if your ever looking for a SWF group I have a discord group that plays together. PM me if you wanna join, you seem cool
---
I really love this -- especially the lore, love how it works its way into the add-ons. Really well thought out mechanics as well-- BHVR, take note.
---
Because its harder for the killer to do turns/360, aka why ps4 players say nurse sucks on it.
---
When you loop on the day of rank reset for 10 minutes, not a single gen pops, then you get hooked and see all three of your teammates crouching in various corners while you go through the sacrifice phases.

Murray was fine last we saw him. Plus David harbour was grew a large beard out, something not needed for hellboy (maybe for his weird Netflix mini show thing about an actor playing Frankenstein?) But it's likely to be him playing someone locked up for a long time
---
It gives u the possibility to lock lots of loops, seems good to me.
---
I love Scoops too but that's because whenever I play Ghostface they're always the ones to let me randomly gen grab them lol
---
I noticed it too
---
F in chat for that.
---
They're adding more BP generating events in the survivor side of things on the 22nd. 
---
BP for:
---
Throwing pallets in chase (nonstun)
---
Fast vaulting in chase
---
Wiggling
---
And a BP amount when a teammate DCs.
---
Someone messaged me 50 times in a row after I killed them with a RBT.

The Self-Care teachable is unlocked at level 40 for Claudette. If you click on "character info", where it displays each character's teachable perks, the teachables appear left-to-right, always.   
---
So Claudette will always have the Empathy teachable available at level 30, Botany Knowledge at level 35, and Self-Care at level 40. If you hover over each perk, it will tell you the level, but it's always this order. If you chose to not purchase the teachable in the bloodweb, it is guaranteed to appear in every bloodweb until you do, even if that means having multiple teachables in one bloodweb.  
---
Once you have purchased the teachable, you also need it to appear in the bloodweb for your other characters.

[MATCHMAKING IS BALANCED](https://i.redd.it/jt8iwst9z5t31.jpg)
---
&gt;I'm at rank 5 and I'll wait 10-15 minutes and I'll still get rank 12s and 10s
---
This is balanced and working as intended according to the new algorithm. They made it so players can get matched up against players up to 6 ranks above or below them.
---
Why does it appear like the two on the left are running TOWARDS the killer, instead of AWAY?
---
You get 5/5 medkits cause of the teabag. Excellent.
---
I’ll never instead how people considering looping toxic.  Camp whoever if it pleases you, but it’s not the best way to play killer
---
Yeah I got really freaking lucky! I had to actually tone down the audio a bunch just not to destroy headphone users.
---
Additionally this made my a cocky little shit in a later game and got a nice big reminder that you can miss the skill check ╭( ✖\_✖ )╮
---
I dont set friends only because its funny.
---
I proudly save all of my hate mail. Every now and then its fun to look through it.
---
I haven’t either
---
Great one man but I feel like It’s ability is a little to similar to the demigorgon
---
Plus killers get 2x bloodpoints attached to a god tier perk while survivors have to waste a perk to get it.
---
I always thought WGLF should have just been added onto We'll Make It.
---
Bhvr is adding in more stuff to allow for Survivors to get more blood points in the nearing update (I.e. Throwing pallets down during chase is now worth BP and every time a survivor DC's, survivors get 600 BP)
---
I'll throw down an F for that
---
Wait a minute, isn't that clown Pukey from Killing Floor?
---
The ratio is tipped towards killer right now relative to normal anyways, which is why survivor queues are near instant and killer queues are sometimes take a very long time.
---

Looping is toxic? Damn I've been too nice to people time to start facecamping survivors for being good.
---
I mean, might be satire but it's pretty accurate
---
I play Feng and it actually reflect how I play pretty accurately 😂 gj
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
---
 *Killer has to find the survivors, chase, mind game, down them and if everything goes right, hook them. While survivors have to just survive and hold 1 button* 
---
My point still stands, thats all bunched into one category: killing, where the survivors categories are all completely different things that arent really related. As a killer, downing and hooking one survivor gives points in all 4 categories, where as a survivor, for example, doing a gen gives points in only one category.
---
 There's a simple reason for that. Killers lose add ons every game no matter what. Survivors can bring any items and keep it as long as they live PLUS retrieve items from the trials itself 
---
I know they lose addons every game, i said that in my post. But addons arent that expensive, killers from my experience makes double what survivors make, paying for any add ons they used and more. Survivors do keep their items, but thats only if they escape.
---
bbq is objectively better than WGLF, since it doubles as a bp perk and a practical perk, sure it has counters but thats literally most if not all the perks in the game. WGLF can be harder to stack because there can be 3 people going for the same person on the hook, where as the killer doesnt have to do anything special to stack.
---
It's a sad time indeed.
---
I play Meg for that 101% movement speed /s
---
I run We'll Make It with WGLF to get extra healing points too. I think BBQ is a fair perk since there's counters to it now, but I do agree that survivors should get more BP. The issue I have is you're competing with 3 other people for gens, totems, and altruism. It would be cool if you got a bonus if you did more altruism than gens for example, something that isnt based on a perk slot.
---
&gt;play with full scoops 10 mins ago
---
&gt;tell my team of randos i’m probably gonna get tunneled
---
&gt;10 minutes later, a HUNTRESS mori’s me
---
We deserve better bros...
---
How is Huntress high up ?? She’s rarely seen from my experience and watching streamers
---
There’s no argument. Your calling people who use it brainless and it’s a useless perk according to you. You’re aggressive in the discussion. There’s no convincing you.
---
Bold of you to assume I can even hit the great skill checks.
---
Really you might just be showing the survivors your totem location, so yeah, nothing wrong there.
---
I mean basically
---
I know it's bad because I've been seeing insta heals as a solo queue survivor.
---
I NEVER see them when I solo queue because people only use them with their 4 man swfs :/
---
Why? Theres key addons so you dont lose them in death
---
Yup. 95% of the windows in the game can easily be worked around without Bamboozle, and I’m not wasting a perk slot on the off chance I get sent to Ironworks against survivors who abuse the window.
---
I main Steve and I am very new! Good job awesome chart :)

Well, no. Increasing acceleration means to get to top speed quicker. Movement speed is overall top speed.

---
As a low rank, I'm inclined to bend for Nurses myself because they're obviously either doing dailies or just new to the game, but most other killers I won't bother testing the waters on, even though half the killers I play at all (Doctor being one of them) I only focus on the dailies themselves. Generally the killer has all the power in deciding what kind of match each game is going to be, so survivors just have to assume the worst once the killer is present.
---
I play on PS4 and the switch he's the only one I play
---
Yikes not the Quentin’s
---
what if he had a map where he uses it to spawn traps at specific places?
---
Seen it before in a rank 1 nurse match, she couldn't blink through it.

This was worse on peer-to-peer.

PLAYING 6 GAMES IN A ROW VS NURSE BECAUSE BALANCE IN THIS GAME IS GARBAGE
---
 i always run enduring cuz it gives you more stalk time imo
---
By learning the mechanics of the game and how to survive efficiently, you will have a much easier time overall. As a survivor, you really want chases that are longer than 45~ seconds, if a killer is committing that much time to chase you, thats half a gen and with 3 survs on gens, that is absolutely what you need.
---
I love bamboozle with fire up. So quick, so agile.

---
I play all the characters in the Do y’all even exist? Category on ps4 actually.
---
I dc-ed looking at your perks
---
Survivor: "Maybe I can fix this generator by pissing on it"
---
Killer: "Let me turn it on for you as you do."
---
ZAP!
---
Well it will be hard without teachables because the best perks for Myers are without a doubt teachables. You usually need Ruin so 3 gens don’t get done in the time it takes for you to build up your stalk. Monitor and Abuse is a staple Myers perk. Infectious Fright is really good once your Evil Within is tier 3 and combos nicely with Monitor and Abuse. Bamboozle is also pretty good on Myers and pretty much is the only killer I’d recommend the perk on. 
---
Without teachables your build isn’t gonna get much better than what you have. Maybe replace one of your perks for Sloppy Butcher or something since you have no game slow down perks in your build.
---
I have been getting them all the time lately, when before like a month or so ago I had never even seen one before. What gives?
---
Tell him he’s great
---
In no way shape or form does Plague need a rework.  They're fine exactly where they are.  She's not low tier either she's easily a mid tier killer.  They either give you NOED and free tracking all game or they turn you into a machine gunning down machine by cleansing.  It's a win-win and she synergizes nicely with several perks.  There are killers that legit need a little help still, she ain't one of them.
---
oh wow
---
For ps4 they can report you if you message hate messages
---
As killer: use ruin it is so useful survivor: self care because ransoms are usually useless
---
I agree without teachables it wont be a good build in comparison, but after I prestige Shape once I'll get going on those teachables.
---
Thank you for your suggestion :)
---
lol, yeah I ment the demon Meg from Supernatural. At least like she was in season 1.
---
Tunneling is focusing on a single survivor until they are dead. After the game ends on PC you can type into a post game chat. I dont beleive it is a feature on console. Killers Mics cannot he heard in game, ever.
---
how did u do that?
---
Can't wait for a year from now when you decide that playing Survivor is more fun than playing Killer.
---
Seriously though, most these folks are right, if you automatically stop having fun just after your first hook, or first down for that matter, this isn't the game for you, cuz the way it's designed even the worst killer in the game will very likely eventually catch the best survivor in the game as long as they don't break chase at all, the ability to keep away from the killer is not meant to be infinite. Just buy your team as much time as you can for them to just do gens, and trust that someone will bring you back into the fight soon (and pray the killer doesn't tunnel, I know at your rank that's probably a social norm, but you can't just assume every game will be like that). More time in each game means more Bloodpoints after each game which means you get better perks faster that will later keep you alive longer, that's the whole game right there.

How did I do what? Get him to come on my podcast? =P
---
I play Claudette because I'm a black female and wanna represent with blackgirlmagic. I can't wait for another black female in the game. It sucks being called a blendette just because I wanna play a cute school outfit. I would wear it no matter the color not my fault they made it black.
---
Uh.. how about no because he was pretty firm that he will not leak anything and pressing on that is just obnoxious.
---
Sloppy, nurses, knockout and tinkerer. I love it.
---
I honestly don't get why Claudette gets all the glory, I've gone unnoticed way more as Tapp.
---
Can you just sum it up for me? Don't feel like watching.
---
I've only been playing for a few days, but....
---
I played against Huntress for the first time last night. Wandering the map, I start hearing evil humming. No idea which killer does that, so I'm creeping around all afraid with my rank 19 and one perk. 
---
Throughout the match, the killer keeps picking up and dropping survivors over and over. No idea why and being new, my assumption was Huntress was being a dick. So throughout the match, I'm saving my hooked survivor friends. 
---
By the end, I'm the last one left. Huntress shuts the hatch and I make for the gate, but she catches me in the middle of powering it on. Yadda yadda yadda, I enter dying state and figure well, this is it. Huntress picks me up and keeps dropping me and I realise it actually raises my lil wiggle meter. She's been intentionally letting us run. 
---
So I run and think, I'm totally gonna die. Then Huntress throws her hatchets at the gate and I realize she wants me to power it up. Cautious, I do. Then she puts me in a dying state again and I think, "You dick! Stop playing with my emotions!" But she picks me up and drops me at the threshold of the exit, then uses her hatchets to indicate for me to go. So I crawl out, win, and get a bunch extra bloodpoints for all of the shenanigans. 
---
After match, they message me gg.
---
Huntress was just a misunderstood monster.
---
I was just making a suggestion? I just started playing killer so yes i am indeed bad im still learning
---
Boy oh boy, do I have a property proposition prepared promptly for your perusement
---
“AHOY LADIES!”
---
I played that like 2 days ago and its worst than you can imagine
---
Ewww
---
Bro what if we kissed in the killer shack?? 😳😳😳
---
Not in a obnoxious way like TELL ME no its only human to wonder. Plus he does like dropping hints he might drop something
---
The King asked him weeks ago and weeks ago he revealed a hint by looking around and smiling
---
Now its closer he might drop something else :)
---
That's nasty
---
are you mad?
---
No?
---
In your opinion * I'm sure many people would agree that the loop of being vomited on until broken, then hit in addition to doing gens and trying not to screw your team over by cleansing isn't very appealing. While i'm not saying my suggested rework is by any means Viable, It is a different more interactive take on her. It isn't a buff or a nerf, It's a rework. But Name one you'd like me to "Nerf into tier W"
---
Yeah, the eyeholes are designed so you can see through them at night, you could cut some darker cloth and hot-glue the eyes like I did on mine a while ago, I don’t have that mask anymore but I’m sure you can imagine what it looks like,
---
I'm new and I have no idea what this means but I like it.
---
I’m new to bubba I figured it just made him faster when he’s swinging the saw.
---
😍😍
---
Love this, specially the perks!   
---
You need to tweet this to BHVR
---
Fauxbait
---
Oh that's just a stereotypical Cannibal main. There aren't many of them anymore so we don't usually pay them any mind, just gen rush and run to the next match.
---
( 0\_0)/ That's what I'm trying to make!
---
Can you offer any advice on where to find the cowl and jacket?
---
Mouse and keyboard only make a difference is fps mainly it wouldn’t really effect this game much besides huntress.
---
Gone after light
---
people such sensitive when it comes talking about gay people and fa* word I'm laughing at u
---
ill bring an ebony if there are 3 or more claudettes in my game
---
The hell are you on about?
---
Did someone say Tron killer?
---
Makes me sick
---
I personally find idv more fun. They have normal games,ranked, 2v8, and blackjack. But i can see why people wouldn't like it.
---
Wish it would die. Cannot tell you how frequently it happens to me, mad annoying
---
Seems like they would be one of he few killers to carry a gun
---
you forgot to pay respect for the fallen survivor.
---
Yeah I had this during the most recent bloodhunt. Exact same hook and the same map. All 4 survivors and killer gathered and we fooled around for a bit. Then the killer whacked the hook as if to announce the start of the game, we scattered and killer gave us like 10s before he/she started to roam lol. Felt like playing hide n seek
---
Downvote for calling my homie a camper
---
Hear me out. 1/1000 games Legion spawns with a gun. Just a pistol with 11 rounds no reload. If he gets a headshot they are dead.
---
Sounds like someone just got banned lmao
---
Once he killed a guy with his thumb
---
Thank you so much for posting the source because, yay artist recognition, and also... Damn, they have a lot of awesome Joey art!
---
To be fair it's not necessarily homophobia, because that would imply that every man who dresses as a woman is gay, which isn't really true, as lots of people do it as a joke. This guy's just a moron.
---
Yeah, that was me.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/de2v6u/papa_ghostface_took_us_to_the_circus/
---
I could get behind that
---
It's always faster to work through ruin than gen tap.
---
I’m a Ghostface main :)
---
I know, I was making fun of the guy on my team who was gen tapping
---
Crack
---
I am too
---
RBT?
---
Bruh where is my ghosty boi
---
Completely inaccurate and untrue, At least i took the liberty in putting some thought into my post.
---
There is a difference between innocently abusing a bug without knowing (people that used to main legion before the bug was known) and going out of your way to literally abuse that bug consciously knowing the outcome, forcing survivors to mend for several minutes. 
---
People that never touched Legion, suddenly were playing him with both blades. This also happened to Tinkerer 2, Hag's add-on (both removed the killers terror radius permanently), Wake Up perk. 
---
I agree that its the developer fault for allowing such bugs to happen but screw people that go out of their way to abuse these bugs after reading about it on forums.
---
Well that's what I get for commenting but not watching lmao
---
I posted a short video of what happened. It was... not a normal match, to say the least.
---
No cons, all pros if you don’t want to be hit with pallets and more time into the chase, there you go.  Cons, if any, would be better perks for Michael. 
---
You only get to T3 at the end? What’s the end for you? When gens are already done? As a killer, you want to avoid that. Get to tier 3 as much as you can. Deviousness points and pressure.  
---
Monitor and Abuse is good on him, because t2 he has a lower terror radius.  Get bbq and chili for bloodpoints and snowballing!!!   Ruin is good because you’re slower in tier 1 and need time to build up momentum.
---
Wow, breathtaking
---
Really good, but the paper boat add-on definitely needs another effect other than blindness if it’s going to be ultra rare
---
This was on Rupaul's Drag Race UK, but Dragula is fantastic as well. That's honestly a perfect description of it and probably why I love it so much.
---
Trust me you don’t want voice chat in this game
---
It definitely sucks the fun out of the game for everyone (killer included, I would think), I don't know why it got wide spread in the first place. Generally I get 4Ks by immediately finding someone else to chase as soon as I hook someone, way better map pressure and all that. Either way I play for fun, not for wins, and try to keep that consistent for everyone else (though there are just too many people in this world that simply can't have fun if they don't win).
---
Why is Ryan in this picture?
---
Don’t underestimate BL on Lery’s. That middle area with the stairs and multiple drops is hell for killers if you run it.
---
Noed isn’t cool either
---
totems? chests? nothing else other than that tbh.
---
It's possible but EXTREMELY difficult
---
15 minutes is my AVERAGE wait for a killer match, 5 for survivor. 30 is not unheard of, and I've seen multiple YouTube killer mains get 4 DCs and mention a waste of 30 minutes, Noob3 comes to mind. So it must not be that strange. Some times I just really really want to kill survivors more than I want to die every 10 minutes in Apex.
---
I'm a survivor main, we appreciate killers like you &lt;3
---
I main Nea, and I'm just a Gen jockey who wants to be left alone. The toxic stereotype gets me tunnelled a lot.
---
Day by Day Night
---
Imo you're expected to rush gens /maybe find some totems along the way. It's when a swf group is super efficient bc they all know exactly where the killer is and where hes going that it becomes annoying. I wouldn't expect a swf to play any differently tho so kinda dumb thing to say
---
I had the same thing happen to me
---
Ash mains rise up
---
I think my favorite part is how the killer musical cue is hammering the whole time while you all frolic together lol.
---
You know what you're right, while the person in this picture is in fact gay, there was another queen from this season who is a straight man. So yes this guy is a moron, but probably still homophobic too let's be real.
---
Okay this post is making a lot more sense now.  I have played against Plagues where I can beat them up at a T L wall or long tall loop and make it take upwards of 40+ seconds to successfully break me.  I've also played as Plague and had great survivors do the same to me.  You flat out are not playing against her properly to completely disregard what I said.  You need to eat your wheaties and practice those loops my man.  Again you aren't looping to avoid the hit.  The hit doesn't come.  You are looping to keep her from having clean direct streams on you.  You need to work on your Plaguge game because there is plenty of counterplay there.
---
Thrill is an underrated perk
---
What's POPPPINNNNGGG UH!
---
Reverse bear trap. It's one of Amanda's abilities.
---
Ah, the dreaded killer handbook for survivours.
---
BLENDETTES WHO CROUCH ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MAP FROM THE KILLER INSTEAD OF UNHOOKING YOU OR WORKING ON A GEN
---
U make us sick, putrid creature.
---
Trapper is “one of the best” in the hands of incredibly good players like Otz. Just like any killer can be godly if played by someone good. 
---
He is not for everyone else.
---
A lot of what went into Freddy was code for previous killers.
---
Designing a whole map for trapper to spawn traps at sounds like it would require much more effort and be very, very buggy.
---
WHAT'S POPPPPPPPPINNNNNNNNNGGGGG! FUCK, GIRL YOU BE LOOKING LIKE A FULL THANKSGIVING FEAST!!!!
---
It's the truth.
---
Laughing at u
---
Jesus christ this community just doesnt stop bitching about things. Today's topic "give us more bloodpoints we dont get enough"
---
I facecamp insidious/mori Steve’s and Nancy’s. No questions asked. ;D
---
Pretty good job so far
---
I mean, the guy murdered 7 people.
---
Oh sorry I didnt mean to imply BL is not strong on that map it just came to mind as an example of a map with strong windows
---
Really? I see Steve all the time.
---
I'm the uwu (David) and laid back (Jake) players.
---
If it's in the game why wouldn't you play it?
---
If my game got such a bug i would love a feedback from players base. The more people to abuse it the faster I'll see it as a possible bad thing for a game and work on fixing it. 
---
In that case, fuck the admins for banning players for their development fault.
---
In other games, league for an example, where they make a bug everyone is abusing it, and in ranked to so developers see it and disabling it as soon as possible and they don't ban the people for using it.
---
Fucking brutal
---
That's amazing xD
---
Ask him what his favorite horror movie is. Then chase him around in a Ghostface mask and stab him.
---
Clown’s over there thinking, “ this shit again?”
---
Not a chainsaw
---
It's almost like he felt bad not dropping it and went back to do so. Rank reset in this game is pure chaos.
---
Dying happy because my friend escaped. A soul for a soul.
---
Banning system in the game, it's toxic, development team and admins don't know how to work properly.
---
Excuse you.
---
You must have a really small penis or something to have this much hate in you 🙃
---
It potentially would if there was a larger community, with more ranks queuing at once. Rank 1 console killers might slide a rank or two as ranks become more meaningful across platforms. But if a guy could get grandmaster on overwatch using an xbox controller on PC, i see no reason why dbd players can't adapt
---
Always say hi to maurice the three eyed horse when you see the poor thing
---
Essentially this exact same meme gets posted every day...we get it.
---
I would agree, a 4 man swf with comms is the strongest role in the game if they have their shit together. If this game ever became competitive, I think that would become quickly apparent.
---
well no. anyways I can have hate and u can't change me for the way I think :)
---
R A T S
---
Please don’t use self care
---
Ah ok
---
Ask him if he thinks they did a pretty good job so far
---
besides Nancy and Steve all the others I hardly see them
---
Not trying to change how you think at all! You can think whatever your early desires. 
---
We just want you to know you don’t have to be such an asshole, dead by daylight is a community we all love this game. 
---
Accept that or just stfu.
---
What if killer is camping and you wanna let your teammates do lots of gens?
---
Ok what reverse bear traps are just didn’t know what it stood for lol
---
honestly i get like three per bloodweb
---
Bitter Murmur is actually a good perk. It gives you great information, to know which generator to patrol next, and it gives you insight on the closest Survivors to Exit Gates. Very underrated perk.
---
People will try to rationalize it but really there is absolutely no explaining how sometimes at the same time of day killer queues will be 10 minutes and sometimes they will be 10 seconds. It has nothing to do with the amount of players. Its a literal unexplained phenomenon.
---
Don’t you love how everytime someone on this sub suggest something someone has to pour salt lol.
---
Lol!  Got you you're just trolling me or just so stubbornly wounded pride that you can't acknowledge that shit that makes sense.  Lol.  In any case if you aren't trolling that's how you run her man.  A really good survivor can often make her just tag you eith her ability to start the process and then she'll just leave to find someone weaker or patrol gens while you eventually break naturally.
---
PLAYING THE PLAG AND LOVING. THE GAME AS A SURVIVOR 
---
YEET
---
I waited 11 minutes for a killer match before I was put in an empty lobby to keep waiting to be matched with survivors not too long ago. It's kind of off putting knowing I might be waiting longer to play a game than I'm likely going to be playing it.
---
Spoiler tag that shit bitch, some of us haven’t watched it yet
---
Wham wham wham wham wham
---
There's a bug in the game with a killer Legion where you use two addons on him, 
---
that are both in the game and available for him to use at the same time,
---
gets you banned for an offence of playing it. They said on their page to not use it and everyone that use it will get banned, but it's in the game.
---
It doesn't make you instantly wint the game, it doesn't even make Legion better than Nurse while using it, it's just considered bad for the game and as bannable offence.
---
Joker, ranged character. \*he just shoots you lmao\*
---
I can tell its Nea through facial expression alone.
---
Let me call the whambulance for you since you can’t seem to stop crying.
---
I don't want to talk to gays go away
---
What about love speech
---
eeeyup
---
Do they plan on eventually adding Xbox One X and PS4 Pro support such as having higher resolutions and graphics settings on those platforms?
---
Who is Mathieu's favorite Killer and Survivor that's currently in the game?
---
Who's Mathieu's dream licensed Killer and Survivor to get for the game?
---
How is the Quentin Smith redesign going, is it actually happening?
---
What was that Tony Hawk tweet about?
---
Has Mathieu heard any of these fan made killer specific terror radiuses/chase music, particularly Jon Rob's ones for Spirit and Plague? What are the chances of these actually be put into the game, either the fan ones or ones BHVR makes themselves?
---
And I appreciate it
---
I did too and it changed to an escape with ace
---
Whoever threw me that silver, thank you bunches! You’re a sweetheart ♥️
---
Oof I'm so sorry, I didn't even think of that
---
There aren't..
---
thank youu
---
Very nice, pyrography is a pretty fun part of woodworking. Love how good this looks
---
No more than DS, really. It's great at countering permanently stealth mode survivors that are allergic to terror radius, and it has some strong counter play when you know the killer is using it.
---
I like his new marauder hair, his other hairstyles look like rats nests though lol. At least he actually brushed it this time.
---
I don't own DBD, i didn't buy it, now am not even considering it.
---
I played it on few accounts that aren't mine personal accounts, and I didn't buy it for those accounts either.
---
I didn't have the cance to play the Legion, I'm playing mostly Trapper, stranger things got me into the game but I didn't play demogorgon either.
---
killers have more than just kill, we also get bp based on gen progress, how many people we hooked, how long we were in chases. I do get your point though, the survivors get a lot less BP for about the same about of effort.
---
Same. I mean, when your options are Ash Williams or anyone else, why would you choose anyone else?
---
I feel like pallets are going to be wasted more now because of this. Also I think that if you are in a SWF and your buddy DC's you shouldn't get BP.
---
hmmmm, maybe your right...
---
\*Nea enters chatroom\*
---
Bruh if you are talking about the mend bug, you are a few months too late.
---
killing yourself on the first hook is straight-up fucking over your entire team, you cant get ban but you are a big cunt for doing it.
---
Totems op pls nerf /s
---
I swear, ruin is in like 75% of all trials and people still can't hit the skill checks in red ranks, smh. 
---
P.s not calling out poster just saying something
---
The other day I had 2 dudes bodyblock me until the killer showed up to try and get me killer because of being a "blendette" one of then was named fuck blendettes.
---
I literally was just doing a generator after escaping a chase and they said i wear the same shit as blendettes when I was just wearing I think default cosmetics, no black shirt, prestige, etc.
---
At least killer gave me hatch after he saw me getting body blocked in till he got there.
---
I actually forgot Rancor did that lol but you have discordance for that anyways so it’s no biggie giving up Rancor imo.  Nurses Calling is also a pretty good tracking perk for Spirit and combos nicely with Sloppy Butcher if you have those perks
---
Well technically it as oc because the content of the meme is new
---
Maybe thats what you would've done.  Im sure this guy was bing cocky.  Happens all the time.
---
You're just too stupid to debate with tbh, You're putting your opinion up as something that needs to be contested when it's a grain of sand in the desert lol The rework is a suggestion, Which is stated. The reason why I chose to give an alternate version for her isn't because she's good or bad or "fInE wHeRe sHe iS" it's because her play style is awfully dull as others are, I just chose to start with her. Looping her effectively has nothing to do with the rework, I'm not sure why you brought it up because i've said why i chose her. Therefore I excused you for essentially being too stupid to read as many are, But not all. This isn't meant to reshape whatever tier list everyone has for the game it's for a better variation of a great concept. Oddly enough when I excuse you idiots you all are usually smart enough to not reply.
---
Eh I love leatherface. He used to be one of my favorite Slashers. Mmm maybe he still is.
---
I agree &lt;3
---
What about the first idea of gen speed debuff?
---
I actually think it would be interesting if there were bad guys on the survivor side.. maybe they weren’t fit to be a killer so the entity’s realm and the endless death loop is now the perfect hell for them
---
So you just wanna have the same amount of BP killer make as survivor because.. reasons
---
Add ons are as expensive as items and add ons, they are not cheaper, you just wanna have more because you think is unfair killer make more (for obvious reasons). That's what it sounds like
---
To make it short, no.
---
They should cut the grinding in general but make survivors get the same amount is kinda dumb. Without even counting you can get 25k without WGLF 
---
What do you think killers get without bbq? In a PERFECT match you get 32k, that's it. Which is rare, the Cap is the same so, no. Isn't needed
---
Killer: *Steps within 80 meters of a survivor, generator, hook, or totem*
---
Dumbasses: "WOW NICE AREA CAMPING"
---
Man you can’t be in this sub spitting facts don’t you know survivors are overpowered and 100% toxic? After all the nerfs survivors are bullying killers across all ranks they need another nerf so killers like spirit and billy can still be viable at red ranks!!! /s
---
I thought it said brazzers in the lower right corner
---
\*Very Rare
---
Dude. Get over it.. its just a game, calm down.
---
Oh my god it does seem that way
---
They should have punished ragequitters a million years ago but resist it because they don't want to chase away the pay pigs. They claim they punish and I doubt they do that. If they did punish then we wouldn't be having posts like this so often. Supposedly, once dedicated servers are in that's next on their agenda. Actually, finally, for once, punishing assholes who DC. And the community ree'd so hard when they announced it. Can you imagine the ree'ing when it finally happens? 
---
The autism squads defend ragequitting as such:
---
"I don't want to play games that aren't fun!" 
---
"How wasn't it fun?"
---
"Uhm, the killer camped me even though my team was hanging around and constantly baiting the killer!" 
---
OR
---
"The killer used broken overpowered add-ons that should be banned! You should be banned for using those add-ons or using the Nurse! THEY'RE TAKING MY GAME HOSTAGE!"
---
OR!!!!
---
"But, my internet is bad and sometimes randomly goes out. Why should I be punished for having shitty internet that negatively effects my team?! I don't get it?"
---
You think I'm joking but I'm not. These are things survivor mains have actually said defending ragequitting. The last one is the big head scratcher. Apparently, there's people with shitty internet that believe they shouldn't be punished for having bad internet. Sorry dude but it's time to move out of the basement, stop stealing wifi or using McDonalds wifi, pay that $40-50 a month for internet at home. It's time to be an adult now.
---
Once you use Nurse or Spirit you’ll probably change your tune. Tier lists exist to categorize the average player.
---
If by wave you mean spam attempts on hook, you're very likely mistaken. Unless you're 500 hours took place in the last month, all at rank 20.
---
2k hours since beta, from rank 1 to rank 20, and in my experience what I've described is the most common.
---
Actually it just permanently shows their aura to you.
---
I feel like Jeff belongs in the “do y’all even exist” category. I main him, but I can probably count on my fingers how many times I’ve been in a lobby with another Jeff or had a Jeff in my lobby as killer in the last 6 months
---
You don't own DBD, as admitted in your comments. Therefore, I don't think you can say what should or shouldn't be in the game, or that survivors are entitled. It's okay to watch streamers, but most of them have a lot of playtime, and as such, are pretty good at the game. This will undoubtedly cause a warped/biased view if you have not personally played it yourself.
---
Dailies are bugged. I’ll trash one and check it one second later and it is changed back to what I trashed. Pretty damn annoying...
---
I'm mistaken in that when they spam escape, and I get them off hook that the killer isnt there? You're joking right? I'd think I'd know if the killer was camping after pulling them off.
---
As a Scoops Ahoy Steve I can say this is true.
---
Midnight rider all the way!
---
And Jeff is listed as sabotaging hooks a lot when that is literally Jake's thing.
---
Ill try that thanks
---
Lol seriously man.  Petty juvenile pathetic insults about my intelligence?  That's what you got after being thoroughly clowned claiming my strat doesn't work earlier?  That's why I broke down for rank 16's like you how to run her at a loop.  You flat out said everything I said earlier was untrue and now you back away from it?  You've got nothing man.  Thankfully the devs ignore noobs like you when it comes to balancing killers that way they aren't all laughing stocks up at red ranks.  Learn how to counterplay a killer before claiming she needs a rework and that proposed strats don't work against her.  You are the entire circus my friend the way you conducted yourself in this thread.
---
Well, his mask, anyway...  Or does his mask kinda _become_ his face at some point?  Anyway, yeah, Michael is literally evil.  Not even a human or any sort of thing, maybe even any kind of living thing.  Just evil.  Make him sexy, please
---
Ask them if they have plans to expand their balance and QA team. These patches only touching a few perks or a killer at a time are extremely slow in combatting the massive amount of changes need to keep up with a large roster of killers and perks. It’s getting old, real fast.
---
I main bubba because he’s a qt, sometimes let last survivor get the trapdoor
---
Chair.. but make it electric
---
I don't know what the bug is, I'm new to the game, they said it's because of addons and reported the guy.
---
Also theres a youtube video that go up today where the guy raged against the legion using those addons
---
I would never hold back streamers and gateaus.
---
Good job!
---
Good idea. It'll make the game seem more fresh too. It's something new after all.
---
Midnight rider
---
You have some leeway with him but IMHO you need 2 perks:
---
Corrupt Intervention and Bamboozle. 
---
Corrupt Intervention buys you time to stalk and get out of EW 1 as quickly as humanly possible. 
---
Bamboozle shuts down terrible loops and when you're in EW 3 you vault as quickly as survivors. Great perk for any killer that can't shut down looping too. 
---
Infectious Fright is good in general. 
---
I kind of like Enduring+Spirit Fury for obvious reasons. Some guy will say "Oh, once they know you have it they'll just drop the pallet early." Good. This is a win/win we force them to stop looping and if they're in a situation where they HAVE to drop the pallet or get hit it still works in your favor. Sadly, it's become less effective since the devs reversed the proximity of pallets back to 8 meters. 
---
After that then any gen slow down perk like Pop or Dying Light is great.
---
Inthink i got seizure reading that title
---
This community is good at not taking responsibilty.
---
That's half the idea at low ranks.
---
If you're getting camped, you're broadcasting to the entire game (killer included) that they can go do gens and don't have to save you. Then, the killer hopefully gets antsy knowing you're telling everyone to let you be, and will run off to apply pressure.
---
"A little bit"
---
That doesn't make sense. You should call them finites, then.
---
It's just lying if you call them infinites.
---
Same, he's just too groovy not to play
---
Damn, who'd you piss off
---
Lol, okay. You're wrong.
---
literally who?
---
Yeah, I can never pronounce Mother-Daughter Ring correctly
---
Other way around for me, to each their own
---
we are all rockstars at heart lol
---
whenever a rank reset happens I don’t play killer until I’ve at least hit purple ranks as a survivor to avoid getting stuck with  new players. Don’t blame them for having a hard time as this game is harsh for noobs
---
At you and you
---
The random trap hooks are the best.
---
See I find the trapper works better as a late game territory killer, guarding 3-4 gens with traps on nearby loops and choke points. Slow build up at the start the game but come halfway through where survivors need the last gens he perks up and brings a load of pressure. The only thing I think he needs is extra traps at start like 2/3 and a quicker time to reset traps, maybe just press a button to reset and hold to pick up.

I wanted to expand on her powers, add more layers to it. At the moment sick survivors will have fake skill checks appear for them and if their on a gen with healthy survivors they will have to step out to throw up. That said having a slowing effect for generators that are covered in vomit makes a lot of sense tbh I'll add it!
---
"You're wrong, shut up new player ree ree"
---
500 hours. Red ranks. Never seen anyone spam hook to indicate them being camped. Do you have a clip of a streamer doing this?
---
Okay I know this is unpopular make beads a pink rarity and don’t change it I don’t play as spirit often but I kind of like them like if I just wanna scare people
---
Operation health caused more problems and bugs in r6 than there was before, it started a decline in the game but dbd has its problems but does need a full fix.
---
It’s true killer is a lot more work more stressful too but I’m a killer main to each their own amigo
---
Pisses me off because it only ever happens when I get one I like and I can never find the right trigger for when I get one I don't like.
---
I thought they had fixed the problem a long time ago. We are talking about infinite mend legion, right?
---
Having watched a few people play against someone using that addon combo, mends were taking 2-3 minutes to complete. Obviously, this wasn't the devs intention and I hope that the ban warning was on display in the news section that automatically pops up when something is added. I was on a hiatus from the game during this time so I'm not sure if it was.
---
If these people were permanently banned then that's pretty messed up, but a temp ban is kinda okay in my mind.
---
Yes killer is much more stressful. Survivor is stressful when you’re being chased but other than that you can just kinda chill when the killer is off doing something else. Meanwhile when playing Killer you need to constantly be aware of what the 4 other players are doing and literally 1 wrong move can cost you the game. Go on a chase for 20-30 seconds longer than you shoulve and boom 2 gens pop.
---
I play both sides, Killer is my try hard side Survivor is my chill side lol
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dje3op/im_here_you_mere_mortals_i_have_infinite_knowledge/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
after 6 seconds your terror radius is removed, all survivors in deep wound will start bleeding out
---
Why not? The killer was being toxic by letting him crawl to the exit gate in hope to leave.
---
Had to check the subreddit
---
yeah, i thought it was obvious enough.
---
Do the frills from that skin get annoying?
---
Legion gets stunned. 
---
Looses all of their power gauge.
---
Spirit gets stunned.
---
Spirit: *laughs in japanese*
---
Makes my fists hurt...don't worry about the computer screen...
---
You know what else isnt cool? Letting the survivor crawl all the way to the exit gate in hopes to leave only to pick them up and then hook them. Let people tbag to their hearts contain against toxic killers like that
---
WHEN YOU ESCAPE A FACE-CAMPING SPIRIT AND RIGHT BEFORE YOU GET YOUR BLOODPOINTS THEY DC
---
The rarity of the offering isn’t so much the issue as it having no direct counter aside from an extremely small number of perks. Not to mention the fact that add-ons shouldn’t remove mostly all levels of skill from a killer.
---
Sure can be! I just don't find her interesting myself :)
---
midnight rider cause biker Kate is the only Kate skin I like
---
Huntress is a furry because she wears animal costumes.
---
I swore I would never purchase skins because I don't see the point in paid cosmetics. I held strong when puppet hand Ash was released, but then Scoops Ahoy Steve happened. That beautiful bastard broke me.
---
I've read all the journals already but this was wonderful
---
Oh yeah God forbid we request changes to make the game more fun.
---
That's the meta. Only cowards use meta perks exclusively. You gotta mix it up. Run No Mither and Self-Care on Claudette. Run Overcharge on Freddy. Nobody can tell you not to
---
Wow. Apparently I'm the only person who likes Cyberpunk Nea, lol
---
Killer bm'd by not lowering them personally into the hatch
---
Maybe if skill checks actually ran at 60fps like the rest of the game(usually) does people would actually hit them
---
well no. I use that word as insult not making fun of gay people
---
Iron Will is a good choice, as well  as Urban Evasion and Sprint Burst. Fixated could work if you have Nancy. Urban Evasion would be best for avoiding detection altogether but Iron Will or Sprint Burst would be good for a back up plan in case you do get caught.
---
Personally I think people exaggerate the differences between killers unless you're in red ranks.  They're all viable, especially if you have decent add-ons and some understanding of how to utilize their kits.
---
Trapper is a ton of fun.  Hearing a survivor step on a trap is one of the most satisfying things in the game.
---
Awh look at you. Can’t come up with actual comebacks so you have to resort to slangs. How wonderful
---
Another Õdachi user!
---
^even ^^though ^^^it ^^^^isn't ^^^^an ^^^^^õdachi
---
Not like rank matters anyway lol
---
I get you bro, it makes you puke, right? That's what happens when you deepthroat too hard.
---
libtard entity destroyed with facts and logic
---
Not sure what wiki page you looked at, but the bloodpoint wiki shows all the categories and scoring events of all ways to get blood points for both survivors and killers...
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints#Overview
---
Never said I didn't like it. I said Kate's was much better.
---
Spine chill, urban
---
Nice. I tried the same mask on at spirit Halloween.
---
The thing is way too small not like thier others. So tight on my head.
---
But you made it look good.
---
So basically you banned another persons account, that guy beat the shit out of you and you're posting this because he's watching you and you dont want the guy to be mad at you, cool
---
This sub is basically just to pick on survivors with lol.
---
Thank you for living up to my last statement.  Did not dissapoint.
---
That's gay
---
Mhm.
---
I've never seen someone using the Cyberpunk skin, though. People prefer the pink hair one and I have no clue why.
---
Ngl nancy takes the cake as most toxic survivor nowadays
---
The disrespect for Freddy here astounds me
---
Aye that would work has a use and a disadvantage
---
WHEN LITTLE VIRGINS MESSAGE YOU AFTER THE GAME BECAUSE THEY CAN’T HANDLE THEY DIED. NOTICED IT’S MOSTLY GERMAN KIDS.
---
How about this? https://www.wish.com/share/9579hafcgw
---
If available, Mori. Even if they've only been hooked once.
---
Cross saves? I really wanna play on switch but I dont want to go through leveling up characters again.
---
In my opinion Billy and Huntress are somewhat fun
---
" old buckle up as a concept shouldn't be removed, just buffed " why
---
it's a shitty perk no one runs cause it not only depends on slugging, there are better anti slugging perks
---
how could this concept of a downed persons aura and seeing the killers aura be buffed?
---
Nah bro this sub has anti killer stuff too, everyone is toxic!
---
But can't you hear bubbas chainsaw cross da map?
---
I think quick and quiet would work better with lithe.
---
I don't understand why people would rather wait 5 minutes for a match that ends in 5 minutes and gives them no Bloodpoints over waiting 10 minutes for a real match where the players are genuinely challenged and have fun.
---
Some people play to have fun you know.
---
Good to know what should i swap it with
---
USE BALANCED LANDING. I USED TO BE A DEAD HARD GAMER BUT ITS WAY TOO INCONSISTENT RIGHT NOW WITH THE CRAPPY DEDICATED SERVERS. THE ONLY VALUE YOU GET OUT OF IT RIGHT NOW IS EXTENDING A LOOP ONE MORE TIME AND THATS IF THE KILLER ISNT BLOODLUSTED AND COMPLETELY IGNORES YOUR DEAD HARD ANYWAY. WHEN I STARTED USING BALANCED LANDING, PLAYING SURVIVOR BECAME SO MUCH MORE FUN
---
10/10 would buy. They could put her in a gardening outfit with crocs and kneepads.
---
&gt; add on that make you pick a trap from distance 
---
Addon: The Force
---
Summon the power of the Jedi and pick up traps from a maximum distance of **12 metres**.
---
Thank that could look cool!
---
Basically
---
Nice caption, Farquaad
---
Nancy's new perk, fixated, pair it with sprint burst and i make it to the end of the game without being in a chase.
---
Try sprint burst, fixated, inner strength and we'll make it.
---
Except you don't really get the better items, the bonus is, at best, negligible.
---
Why do you care so much. This is like the 4th time you’ve posted this
---
I bring Mori's for anyone with TTV in there name
---
I added the Slowing effect, How does "Every 6 seconds generator progress stops for 2 seconds"? Additionally skill checks still continue
---
This brings back ancient memories
---
Eh true, I guess I just overestimated how much effort it would take to get to EW3, especially since i have almost prestiged shape once and will now get things to boost duration of EW3.
---
The original topic was queue times though, that’s what the joke was about. He’s talking about what happens when people have to wait in a queue to long, it’s completely related to the main topic. Even if it wasn’t, it’s related to his original comment, which is upvoted, yet this one isn’t.
---
One time, I heard a whoosh while on a gen and though “oh, it’s a wraith”. Then I got pulled off the gen by spirit
---
It’s up to you really lol
---
Just thought it would be a bit more to push it into a good zone.  Making people actually want to cleanse.  
---
Sounds good to me though.  (Heck if you wanted to make it even easier on yourself I’d just say like a static % drop, like having thanatophobia on)
---
No Mither + Hope = gg m1 killer
---
Killer is more stressfull and has a higher skill ceiling, not always harder but requires a higher average skill to compete properly.
---
Depends on how you use it. It can be good or it can be a huge waste of everyone’s time.
---
Omg the skill checks. I can’t tell you how many times I missed a ds when I thought I hit it. It needs to be 60 FPS. Forget new chapters. Fix the damn skill check.
---
Jake off
---
I've literally spent over twice your entire playtime playing survivor at rank 1 lol, with legacy killer and survivor. You saying 500 hours doesn't matter.
---
No, I don't have clips saved of things that I'll need to pull out to show noobs they're wrong (or any other clips for that matter).
---
We already agreed you're going to do what you want, so go ahead. It doesn't matter.
---
I HAVE GOOD HEARING SO LET ME TRANSLATE THIS FOR EVERYONE:
---
"NOT SURE ABOUT WHERE TO FIND INFO BUT ON PC, HALF THE GAMES R DEDICATED SERVERS AND HALF AINT LMAO IT'S EASY TO TELL AS THE KILLER NOT 100% SURE HOW TO TELL AS SURVIVOR
---
Self care, deliverance, decisive strike, adrenaline.
---
Or she would be if people actually cleansed.
---
So you are homophobic then if you hate gay
---
Rider kate, kates best girl

If they made a Mori with a gun I’d pay for it

Look up Fungoose on YouTube or twitch, he’s amazing with Plague. I think he uses Discordance / Pop Goes the Weasel / Corrupt Intervention / Infectious Fright. He’s an “educational streamer” so whenever he plays he just literally explains every move that he’s making so you can learn a lot from him.

Idk man once you start to get into higher ranks the game isn't so easy. I will admit though enchantress,ripper and soul weaver are broken. Also not sure whens the last time you played but they nerfed tf out of pristess.

---
1: REAL LIFE PROBLEM
---
2. THE KILLER IS SLUGGING EVERYONE ON PURPOSE. 
---
WHATS THE POINT IF YOURE JUST GOING TO BE ON THE GROUND THE WHOLE GAME VS NURSE? ITS BORING AND UNINTERACTIVE.
---
JUST DC AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT GAME.
---
I'LL BITE.
---
YOU'RE BAD! YOU SUCK! NOED AND PEANITS ARE GOOD! THE GAME IS SURVIVOR SIDED!
---
Self care, Deliverance, spine chill and decisive strike
---
Thats their rank
---
Because most of us have been playing since release. Devotions only came out like just over a year and a half ago.  Games been out since 2016. A lot of that time is probably queuing and chilling
---
USE CORRUPT INTERVENTION AND WATCH THE MAGIC HAPPEN
---
I’ve seen walls not spawn, but have collision. Like a jungle gym where I couldn’t see any of the walls. Not sure if the survivors experienced that. And one time, a tractor was magenta. Pallets also sometimes grey. That’s all I’ve ever experienced on Xbox.
---
He's not as bad as someone like pig but trapper definitely isn't one of the best killers. He has to take a huge amount of time gathering and setting beartraps which can end up with 2 gens getting finished before you even set all of your traps. You need to stay fairly close to your traps and survivors can disarm them.
---
It’s just the ending text for the bold code
---
We all know what his name actually is. Lord Fuckwad.
---
finally, a tier list of quality. bill deserves more worshippers.
---
Definitely are. Most 360 no scope montage potential. I just find them daunting. DBD is already stressful enough, and i like the small game of loop chasing
---
I think it's a great idea
---
&gt;And the fact that Behaviour thinks this is fine is fucking ridiculous. Especially after rank reset it's a freaking joke. I hate having games where I loop a 1 perk Killer for 30 minutes and zero gens are done, or games where I bring brown addons and get a 4k at 3+ gens.
---
They can't make things more stricter, it would lead to insane queue times until matchmaking found the most even match ups. Insane queue times also lead to nonstop spam of people complaining on forums and people harassing devs on social medias. 
---
YOU might continue to get somewhat fast queues but BHVR thinks about DBD as a whole. People at rank 20 would never be able to find matches a few weeks past rank reset and people ranking up too fast shortly after the rank reset wouldn't be able to play either. Not to mention SWF.
---
[They've actually done quite a lot, was surprised when I first saw their list of games.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_Interactive)
---
Trapper bag, honing stone, bloody coils and iridescent coils are all add ons to combat those weaknesses. Of the 17 killers, where would you rank him?
---
Iridescent stone not coils*
---
Yeah he’s my favourite atm. Proper funny guy as well, this clip just made me laugh my ass off as he left the Nea hopeless.
---
Will there ever be more methods for a survivor to defend themselves barring pallets, DS and Head On for example? Not necessarily fighting back, but some method in the environment.
---
Will No Mither ever get any changes like the popular idea that you start healthy and then it kicks in if injured? As of right now, there's no incentive to run it, I understand the logic of "Hard mode" but so far it's too crippling a perk to actually be considered usable.
---
Why do certain characters seem to be prioritised in terms of cosmetics, like Claudette and Meg seem to be getting a hell of a lot more cosmetics than other characters (side note, David's a former rugby player but why doesn't he have a rugby uniform cosmetic?)
---
Will there ever be an opportunity to get missed event outfits like the Huntress' Hound mask and David's Untamed Donkey Jacket, even if it's via the Store?
---
Demo is boring to me. He's too much like the Hag and even though I don't play her, I appreciate her. She has solid add ons.
---
Because nobody fucking cares. Whos going to check for stolen content? You? mods don't have the time to look up everything posted if its stolen content, they upvoted the post cause it was neat. Next time watermark your shit, he never claimed it was his.
---
I haven't even read the comments yet, but I'll go ahead and be the fiftieth person to say:
---
Nice meme, the only problem is that right now we're waiting a long time for unbalanced matches.
---
I mean can we talk about how easy the doctor actually is to play I don't even like him and whenever  This challenge pops up not only can I do it in a single game but I have yet to have a person escape when I'm playing as him
---
Not everyone constantly has those add-ons and I'd put him in mid-high tier depending on the person using him
---
oops, i got it confused with his other perk. still tho, because you, or your favourite streamers don't run a perk, doesn't mean the perk is useless to all. good killers slug often, if you want a 4k as a killer, and there are 2 left, your best option is to slug one and find the other.
---
buckle up lets you know when you can just run to the survivor and pick them up, because sometimes you can't afford to spend too much time healing a dying state person. and buckle up helps with that.
---
the speed boost thing isn't a bad idea, it's just the aura reading is useful still, and shouldn't be removed.
---
Sacrificed by Sunlight
---
Can you ask if Dead By Daylight will be on the Soulja Boy Console?
---
This is like when I had a daily challenge to open the exit gate  Playing as Feng.  She's only level 5 because I put almost no points into her  And the Michael Myers we were playing against was polite enough to let me open the gates when I was the last person alive
---
I find Killer to take a lot more focus and energy. I can't do it if I'm not in a good mood. Survivor is easy to do if I just want to relax and don't mind being a little messier
---
I can Never pull off a blind.
---
Iron will, Dead hard, DS, borrower time. Self sufficient but you can also save your teams ass, can swap out BT though for something like Adrenaline/inner strength/ Unbreakable/ .
---
I once 3k’d as Legion and was searching for the last (Steve) and when he saw me he stood directly facing me and stared at me. I couldn’t kill him after that so I let him do a few gens because there were still 5 left and I gave him hatch
---
The description has grammar issues too
---
Same for clown
---
How about making a casual mode and a competitive mode?
---
Her name literally checks out.
---
"I think someone messed of the typing..." Speak for youself.
---
Slowing all generator speeds by like 50% isnt much of a counter lol
---
I mean, you literally do get the bonus, that’s a fact. I’d agree that’s it’s not big enough of a difference to be the sole factor behind prestiging, though. If you want to prestige 3 because you think your bloodwebs are gonna be drowning in purples/iridescents, you’re better off not prestiging.
---
I get that, I’m a terrible killer as it is. So playing as The Plague, that makes things even harder to me!
---
Sigh, I'm saying they are complaining about the brought gun and its implications, not the specific fight and its sequence of events. It is irrelevant to the fight, but not irrelevant in the context of you trying to cheat in your hypothetical scenario. Just because your foe was weaker than expected and your gun was neither used nor needed doesn't change you giving yourself an easy way out if you were the one being crushed. Context matters.
---
She is just very difficult for me to play as that’s all!
---
Buy one, get a laser sight for free!
---
amanda main here. the trap queen is fun to play. that is all.
---
Hard to play well, fun is subjective. Just try him out
---
“Wants to force their 500 pound life on you to heal themselves” What?
---
I'm gagging, alongside Akeria's headress moment, this would genuinely make a gorge Plague outfit.
---
Wow what a pair of lil bitches. I HATE people that team up with killers... Like why do it?
---
Where were you hiding?
---
The two Killers could literally not be any different wtf?
---
Little bit of stealth along with slowdown with your attacks. Draw back is that you have really bad gen pressure.
---
Life can't even bless me with decent employment let alone opportunity and fortune
---
Lol so dumb
---
I literally go some salty messages because I was playing Trapper and set a trap in front of ruin....they fell into it twice. =|

Imo I’d switch Jake and ash, but this is a very good list.

Oof… hopefully Survivors won't do gens. D=
---
just training his sprint bursts
---
Oh? I see, I didn't know that... thank you.

Hopefully the joke was funny tho.
---
A week ish is usually enough from my experience
---
Thankfully I haven't personally seen too many toxic Steves yet. I've seen more toxic Feng Mins. But yeah the rest looks right in my experience lol
---
It's primarily because Legion and Pig are logically the easiest characters to cosplay, when I was at Comic Con last year I saw a Huntress cosplay which was decent, amusingly even talked to a Redditor who posted a picture of it on here. Killers like Hillbilly and Trapper for example would require a lot more effort such as having the deformities in (likely) a body suit for Hillbilly and being able to have something what could easily be passable to the Trapper's build for example.
---

Yuuuup. XD

Ironically, I just got back from doing a Clown daily at that point.

I read it as "Daddy Tier List" and now im disappointed

It’s Entity-Vision
---
No its not, its a aura reading of one person and if they die your addon is useless
---
Depends on what are you going for...Selfcare is an almost must have, if youre going for gens, then prove thyself, poised, technician (if you're a potato like me)

Playing Monster Hunter World Iceborne is great for reliving stress

Ive had the game since week 1, I play rarely and very casually but have been a laid back Jake main since
---
Holy shit that game was god tier...
---
Nancy is basically the new Nea for when I play killer. Always has a flashlight, always has instant heals, always tries to get my attention lol
---
Perhaps it is a message from the Entity? =O
---
My problem is as killer is that for some reason survivors think my job is making them have a good time. Its constant. If i 4k i am a sweaty bitch who needs to off myself. If i dont get a kill im a noob trash killer who needs to off myself. If i give the hatch to the last surv, the other 3 message me saying theyre reporting me for teaming with the surv. If i dont give them hatch im getting spammed with messages saying im an asshole who doesnt play the game right. Now i literally do not care about survivors fun factor. I will run the most overpowered stuff i can. I will not let you be just because you just got unhooked. Tunneling is a madeup concept because when it comes down to it, why should i let you go heal up? So you can come try to loop me for 5 minutes? Nah.  As a killer its a lot less stressful when you ignore what the survivors have to say.
---
E tier
---
I actually didn’t know that happened, that’s kinda cool.
---
People have been getting perms banned recently for death threats. So depending on what they say....
---
you’re exactly how I imagined a legion main to act
---
:(
---
Legion bad
---
I get it’s an idea to try to make the perk better, but realistically the better way is to change it to a normal perk and tone it down a bit, since Hex perks have strong passive / effects but they can easily be cleansed which is the problem for them.
---
Why so someone can just put a water mark over your water mark? Honestly who cares.
---
