Oh cool, I didn't know they had issued a statement on it.

Me and some pals were coming up with this one, simply because of the name
---
It's really not that violent compared to a lot of other games such as GTA, military FPS, and anything with hordes of enemies to kill. Not that any of those games should need to explain themselves nor will they since it's been proven for years that violent video games and other media don't cause real world violence.

They were the ones usually using speed hacks in F13th too back when that first came out.

Oh damn. That's evil. Bruh. Run these perks on ghostface or Meyers.... no escape lol
---
These perks are meant to counter loops if survivors play hide and seek these perks won't be as effective that's pretty much the reason why i came up with them I hate looping so I thought of perks that force survivors to hide rather than run in circles all day
---
Because it makes it easy to sneak up on people who don't cleanse

majority of survivor mains streamers wants to remove spirit due to lack of counterplay lul

Let me give it to you short. Adrenaline = I did gens I’m rewarded. NOED = I failed to protect gens. With EGC

Play spirit and pray they think it’s Haunted Ground

Are they even that commonly used?
---
Yeah and the no hooks required moris. Games were like 5 minutes tops with those
---
ive gone through at least 5 matches in the past 2 days with keys it’s exhilarating
---
Dammit. The joke was that they were all supposed to be general perks (and therefore free) but the Third Seal is a Hag perk, isn’t it?

Didn't know dual sickness effectiveness add ones stack. I understand everything you said though, im going to have to give enduring a shot. Question though, do you run any anti gen rush perks? Ruin/corrupt/pop/etc? Dont you get gen rushed ? Thats the biggest problem I have with her.

Love when a killer has NOED and I instantly find their totem

somehow this is toxic. Give me a break. Everyone on this sub cries for no reason.
---
I mean OP said it themselves but also:
---
* Could be phasing
---
* Could've had to tab out for a moment
---
* Game could've frozen (for either side)
---
* You could just not be an asshole who DCs on first down
---
Some of us have a quirk or two when playing as a killer :P
---
Whispers is great for finding people and sloppy increases the healing time. Those are really the only good non teachables I think about besides NOED
---
Adrenaline = My *teammates* did gens, not me. Also congrats you did the only objective so instead of winning you super won.
---
Yeah because she is insanely toxic and breaks rules constantly. She should have banned from the game a long time ago. People get banned for less.

This is probably the best thing I've seen in a long ass minute haha. Too true
---
Get good.
---
To my knowledge in a Dev update recently they said they're looking at the matchmaking for premades like the one you encountered.
---
What they are going to do is take the average rank of the group and put them against a killer at the average rank, so if there was a group of a rank 3, 7, 10 and 15 they'll be placed against a Rank 8 killer, or there abouts. It will help you to not play against rank 6s in the future.
---
I do however still think it's BS to play against the average rank of an SWF when you should be forced to play against the rank of a killer that matches the highest rank of the SWF because for starters the skill gap between red ranks and purple ranks is huge. Further from that, the "skill gap" between how well and SWF performs at all ranks is infinitely higher than a bunch of solos, so you should be forced to play against a better killer, not a worse one.
---
Well BBQ has far tracking and whispers does close tracking. I usually dont run anti gen perks not because I dont find them useful but because I rely a lot on at least attempting to be leathal enough to not need them. Yes it does bite me in the ass a fair bit some games but personnaly if I put ruin on it only actually helps me like 20% of my games which doesnt really feel that helpful even if during the games they dont find it, it is extremely helpful. So I use a lot of tracking perks as GF to attept to always know where everyone is so I can sneak around the map effectively as GF. My usual GF build is whispers, BBQ, discordance, and my fourth I mix up between haunted, devour, or infectious.
---
GOT HOOKED AND FACE CAMPED BY A TRAPPER AS SOON AS THE GAME STARTED, GOT TO SECOND STAGE AND AS SOON AS MY TEAMMATE PULLED ME OFF AND I WAS INSTADOWNED AGAIN I JUST LEFT. FUCK YOU CUNT THE GAME JUST STARTED. LEARN TO PLAY INSTEAD OF KISSING ME ON THE LIPS.
---
I DON'T EXPECT TO WIN AND I'M NOT UPSET ABOUT THAT, I'M UPSET THAT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY A GAME I HAVE TO PAY ONCE A MONTH BECAUSE OF PS+.
---
This is dope, i luv ur art style.
---
I mean, you can easily run Self Care and Autodidact to not only be able to heal yourself, but also charge tokens for healing other people and eventually get to the point where you just self care the moment you get a Skill Check. This leaves you with any item you want (Flashlight or Repair Toolbox), two perks to choose, and happy team mates when you heal them.
---
Small Game literally counters NoED by allowing you to passively locate the totems instead of going actively looking for them. You no longer have to go running around for two-three minutes finding five totems because you know when you're nearby one. Yes, you can say that you should know the spawns anyway, but how many "Fuck NoED" comments/posts do we see all the time?
---
Distortion counters quite a few very relevant perks (BBQ, Bloodwarden, Nurses) and while it doesn't do anything for stuff like Discordance, it does help against pretty much anyone who isn't an absolute try-hard which is most of ranks 12-8.
---
And all of this is not going into Houndini Builds (Lithe + Q&amp;Q + Dance with Me), Gen Builds (No Mither + Resilience + Streetwise + Toolbox), Info Builds (Map + Crystal Bead + Detective's Hunch) and so on that are already in the game that no one uses.
---
Even if you want to say that none of those builds are worth it, and if you still want to say that those perks aren't viable, that doesn't change the fact that back when MoM was actually good, you'd see MoM + Adrenaline + Dead Hard, and then either Decisive Strike or Borrowed Time. That's not diversity, and MoM needed to go because it was too powerful. You're point still stands refuted; MoM did not provide something new. It just stacked with a ton of perks that were already available to make a big pile of bullshit for any Killer that wanted to play anything except top tier.
---
Keys are fair just like moris :)
---
That is basically the point of the prayer beads
---
No but he shouldn’t be an ass to a newer player
---
Who doesn't want to do that after a couple games...
---
For me I don’t mind paying that much for skins because the game is really cheap and it is a way for them to make a little more money to put back in the game. That said I do think the Pig’s cosmetics is overpriced.
---
"the ghost"
---
NO
---
GET GOOD. 
---
I CANT FUCKING WAIT TILL THEY MAKE THAT MIDNIGHT CRUSADER BITCH LIGHTER
---
Nice.
---
Keys and Moris both need to be nerfed to the fucking ground I love winning as killer to depip because some jackass found a key. Moris need to only work after second hook and keys  can’t instantly open hatch it should have a 10 second animation that can be hit out of
---
Just found some template for a ghost face perk

Yes I see them all most every single game in high ranks

what was his name after the match

Nea is beautiful, all of them are. Only ugly one is Claudette

You should do one for killers

What rules lmfaooo?! It’s DBD for gods sake 😂😂

Honestly I don't care if this gets omega down voted. I've said my bit and I'm good now.
---
If you want to be excited and think about every move trapper might be the killer for you, I’m not really fond of him but playing against good trappers can be a nightmare
---
Yeah he’s a little clunky, but I’ve seen some serious big brain shit be pulled off when going against trappers.

Maybe give him a shot!

Yeah, I’m not pumped about the new ghosty cosmetic.

Another eye scorchingly bright cosmetic for a stealth killer??? And it still has those annoying tendrils too??!??! JOY!

But none of the characters with a rape-puter say "molto bene".

All people do is complain on this sub reddit, it’s so bad, I can’t just make a statement without everyone going bat shit on me, you responded to my comment therefore you read through it and hopefully understand it, so why after that do you decide to comment something unrelated taking more stabs at me, calm down dude
---
Yeah I don't put a trap right in front of them since it is too obvious but I put a traps in the direction they could possibly come from or ways they would run after the unhook. I haven't ran devour hope since I don't what kind of build I could use it in.
---
Give my boy bubba some love );
---
I think it should be ultra rare, not nerfed. And father's glasses should be very rare, not ultra rare.
---
I seriously workout to that song. Lol
---
It's a joke
---
Proxy camping is a thing though. There’s face camping and proxy. We just have to say proxy because face camping exists.
---
What I don't like about 'proxy camping' is it's essentially the same as looping. people will grip about it, but it's a fundamental part of the game that should be utilized. If the killer isn't going to BBQ someone proxy-camping can easily be the optimal use of their time to apply pressure. 
---
nobody enjoys being looped/proxied, but it shouldn't be a thing to go and force people to admit to.
---
You know what, I’ll try to learn him. I’ve never been able to get into him, but I’m actually going to try, maybe that will do something.
---
Yeah well... fuck!
---
There's two kinds of protection hits. I think they even award different BP amounts but only ONE of them counts for WGLF/MoM. Sometimes you can even earn both "Types" from one attack. (You see Protection appear twice, with different BP amounts) 
---
No idea how the game decides what counts for what. I've bodyblocked people and had it not count, hell I think I've been accidently hit on the hook by the killer or had my dangling body stop a huntress hatchet and earned a stack. Other times bodyblocking seems to work.
---
I know being hit by the killer while he's carrying someone definitely counts 90% of the time. Other times I was nowhere near anyone, (Although survivors were in the area) get hit, and suddenly I get protection but no stack.
---
There's definitely two types of protection hits and I am not sure how the game decides which to give out. The one that doesn't give you stacks should be renamed to something else.
---
it's bubba's property
---
Plenty of survivors still play for the stun though. I've gotten tons of use out of spirit fury on red ranks on PS4.
---
It's a glitch that happens sometimes, one of a million in this game
---
this is incredibly underrated smh
---
👀
---
I agree with you about the gen rush thing. Like that's literally the one thing the survivors are supposed to do, and you should want them done as fast as possible naturally.
---
Making it ultra rare wouldn’t change much (besides how often you get them of course) I would say a slight nerf like maybe Longer Cool down, or maybe Slower speed while moving. Or maybe you could see a glimmer of her when shes phasing like when wraith is invisible
---
Yeah nice repost, laughed too hard -_-
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE ALL OF THE HILLBILLY SKINS SO FUCKING BAD!? AND THEN HAG HAS 2 FUCKING BANGERS (Chemosynthesis AND Photosynthesis), PLUS WRAITH HAS HIS HALLOWED BLIGHT SKIN WHICH LOOKS DOPE! AND TRAPPER HAS HIS NEW ONE WHICH IS BOTH AWESOME AND GRUESOME! HELL, WHILE WE’RE AT IT, HOW COME ALL OF HUNTRESS’ HIGH PRICE SKINS ARE TRASH, WHILE THE GREEN ONE WITH A SHAWL AND RECTANGULAR AXE LOOKS SO FUCKING GOOD? THE FUCK IS UP WITH THAT SHIT?
---
Yeah, but it's not a good trade off 2 kicks for an auto break 
---
Basically you wind up wasting a lot of time
---
Oh, so you are approaching me!
---
&gt;Small Game literally counters NoED by allowing you to passively locate the totems instead of going actively looking for them.
---
Or you can just know that the spawns are there because you've learned the spawns by now. It doesn't really save that much time.
---
&gt;Yes, you can say that you should know the spawns anyway, but how many "Fuck NoED" comments/posts do we see all the time?
---
I don't really feel like starting a noed discussion, lets just say the perk has certain design flaws that make people complain about it despite knowing the spawns.
---
&gt;Distortion counters quite a few very relevant perks (BBQ, Bloodwarden, Nurses)
---
Again you can just not heal in terror radius/99% gates/get into lockers/be in bbq's range. It's a lazy person's perk, the effects of which you can get by paying attention to what is happening. 
---
&gt;I mean, you can easily run Self Care and Autodidact to not only be able to heal yourself, but also charge tokens for healing other people and eventually get to the point where you just self care the moment you get a Skill Check. This leaves you with any item you want (Flashlight or Repair Toolbox), two perks to choose, and happy team mates when you heal them.
---
The teammates are going to be pretty pissed since in most games you won't be healing enough times to charge the perk to full. It's much better to run Botany knowledge since it's working at full force from the very beginning. It would be good to run together with self-care if self-healing skillchecks counted towards Autodidact.
---
&gt;and if you still want to say that those perks aren't viable
---
Please, point me to the line in which I say that those perks are not viable. I've clearly stated that they are just simply not worth taking over less situational perks. You can make them work, but they will be outclassed by other perks that are just more reliable in more situations.
---
And then shes a slightly worse version of myers
---
I 4K and safety/de-pip all the time. Guess I'm too good?
---
Myers isn’t permanent though unless you run an add on that’s makes him slower
---
The new killer is going to be Jason ;)
---
Bubba is alright. I just wanted to make meme. If you play bubba kudos to ya
---
for survivor I absolutely love the plunderers with ace in the hole combo or sprint burst and decisive to yeet away when I get hooked and for killer it's discordance and shadowborn
---
adrenaline rush is also a good choice in my experience ;)
---
I’m sorry it must be poorly worded, you get the speed for 15 seconds regardless of how many times you vault windows, this boost would not be able to be activated again for 90 seconds
---
TAKE THEIR BODIES AS YOUR OFFERINGS!
---
I used to play Michael pretty seriously and now I just play meme killers and try to manipulate games as much as I can. I like trapper with iron grasp, always bring em to the basement.

just use franklin's

I wanna know this myself. Had some really strong Ghostface games last night, and each one was a black pip. It was incredibly annoying
---
Would you like to elaborate?
---
There’s a difference between poo poo and pee pee. Poo poo is looking at the poo side, pee pee is peeing on what pood.

I think that perk is meant to be like it is. When your parents are coming to check *insert where you are*, you feel their presence and you are able to cover yourself up and pretend you are watching some ramdom vid.

Your best bet is finding someone who has these and getting them to DM you a pic

2 dollars for a skin ? Really ? Where's the shitpost flair ?

I haven't. Then again, I usually don't live long enough to have it spawn anyway.

Agreed

Can confirm, I'm the friend ~~not really, but I also want BBQ&amp;C~~.

Well it’s a popular meme format and although I haven’t seen past season one of stranger things, this doesn’t look like a big spoiler to me

it doesn't.

[removed]
---
screen shotted for refernece. Thank you very much.
---
100%.  Just wish he could compete in the lower ranks......🥔 killer
---
They never said anything about the original mettle of man, they just want the perk to work as it is currently intended to.
---
Hello again. Thanks for taking your time. Any chance you know of a meme that shows all the useless item parts? Or can you make a full list of all the useless parts for all items flashlight/med kit/key/map/toolbox. So I can easily identify these parts to avoid wasting blood points. Don't feel obligated, but I think for new players (including myself) this will save confusion. I like your memes btw. I kept them screenshotted.
---
Nope
---
Just curious but I play on Xbox but would simply just making a clip of someone showing they disconnected be enough? I report people every time they do because it’s gotten old.
---
Fuck off I’m going for more commodious toolboxes to stash in my inventory, to then never use 🙃
---
yes and I hate the swamp map for it -_-
---
Unfortunately you can't get more tokens. I'd probably run this perk alot if it was possible honestly.
---
0%
---
someone's angry
---
In that map it's pretty common
---
Honestly I would try picking up Huntress. I avoided her for so long because of her high skill ceiling, but god damn is she fun once you get good with her. It definitely, at least for me, made playing killer fun again.
---
Neither of them increase vaulting speed anymore
---
I think its fine for Freddy. Being in the dream world is supposed to be threatening, it’s not something you’re supposed to just brush off. Not really sure if Huntress needed it though
---
You gotta use its tokens well. It can help you with concrete information as to what add-ons/perks the killer is running. If a teammate gets hooked and a token is consumed, 100% confimation BBQ. If not, then he has no BBQ. Heal near the killer to detect Nurse's Calling or lack of it.
---
There's been a few games I've detected all of the killer's perks (BBQ, Nurses, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher for example) and ruled out NOED. When I notice I cannot detect more than 2 killer perks even after testing BBQ and Nurse's and I make a guess the killer has NOED and in most instances I've been right.
---
If I know the killer has BBQ I typically save my last token if possible for key moments. I've been able to escape a few times through an exit gate because Disortion hid my aura from a Hillbilly with BBQ.
---
🤡🤡🤡
---
Absolutely, i wanted him to get heated and make mistakes
---
*but it can't stun the killer* It can do something more.
---
Thanks for the info, they definitely should change the name of protection hits that don't add tokens to mettle of man. Also yeah getting hit while someone is carried works all the time and unhooking someone and getting hit, the chasing protection hits are the ones that sometimes don't work at all.
---
Drats. Do you happen to have those cosmetics, by any chance?
---
I know thats why Id say put in a lingering effect so even if they try to work around it by stopping it wouldnt save them.
---
That would be awesome, it would fuck the killer if its a 4 swf 🤣
---
Cringy content
---
I do not, I’m considering picking up the city slicker Cloak, but all his other cosmetics kinda suck imo
---
Good luck though man, hope you find em
---
It doesnt go down, thats why most people pair up urban and sprint
---
Honestly both of the masks besides the one it comes with does not match well. I own of GhostFaces cosmetics with the p3 stuff and they just don't match because the red is too bright with the gray and the bloody mask is too dark with the chrome on it
---
That's what I mean. I'm not sure exactly what counts. Maybe the killer has to be in a chase with the survivor you're protecting, or it only counts during the "Unsafe Unhook" period after you rescue someone. 
---
They should just make the 100bp protection hits count since I get those all the time even when I'm making a conscious effort to bodyblock someone.
---
As a streamer I get the importance of music but I just pause when I drop in map because audio queues make or break a game for both killer and surv.
---
Thats alright. Thanks for everything!
---
Np

Wah wah wah 😭💦💧💦

GETTING REAL SICK OF THE MATCHMAKING ABUSING TROLLS.  3 RED RANKS AND THEIR SMURF YELLOW FRIEND ALL NIGHT LONG BULLYING AND BEING GENERAL ASSHOLES IN POST GAME CHAT.  ONLY 1 GAME TONIGHT AS A GREEN/YELLOW HAS NOT HAD AT LEAST 2 REDS.  FUCK MATCHMAKING.
---
i meant framedrops lmao
---
This happened to me too a few times, but some time ago I had a Piggy grab me off a gen right at the start of a game. And something about the timing..... it just scared the absolute shit out of me, and I was kinda shook for the entire game. Even though I knew she had no terror radius after standing up. It was such a good jump scare that I had to message the killer afterwards. Too good to not share it.
---
https://youtu.be/eVMxl8pyu20

It happens within the first 30 seconds
---
Di molto
---
I was actually accused of hacking recently. He claimed I was using wall hacks because I could hear him around a corner like 5 seconds after he pallet dropped me :\\
---
me too!
---
go to settings to activate windows
---
No, that's the point, to confuse you, just look around, you're supposed to be on your toes, the Lullabies and the stealth killers are probably the only thing still doing this in the game.
---
oh haha thanks
---
Which one increases the wiggle rate? I feel like that must be kinda helpful. Considering how often I wiggle out without it (or just need that little extra bit) I feel like it could come into clutch use. Worth the 2k shards at this point? Probably not. But I'm surprised nobody likes it.
---
Harry Warden from my bloody valentine because he looks badass and I love the movie
---
Ah good point. Damn. I wish SWF didn't exist, as much fun as it is to play with friends it's so unfair on the killer. Haha.
---
oh thats actually sick. too bad im on xbox lol
---
who down voted me i just wanna talk
---
Yeah, it definitely needs to be changed.
---
Skyrim's better, way more relaxing. Unless you start hearing the same dialogue over and over and it's your follower, then yeah.
---
"I, Dwight Fairfield, have a dream."
---
*piano music intensifies*
---
Also not a crime to stand next to a hook for 2 seconds especially if they spotted scratch marks or heard something nearby
---
Wait, you guys don't do that?
---
That's very true but I would only use f
---
The perk with ooo, bbq Is already easy to counteract, and the perk knowledge doesn't intrigue me, would you say it Is worthwhile with object
---
I’m pretty sure you get an achievement from doing it a certain amount of time.

ONLY COWARDS PLAY CLAUDETTE

USUALLY I PLAY NEA BUT I PLAYED BLENDETTE FOR 5 GAMES AND IT WAS FUN
---
Who said we needed to use our foot 🤣
---
Ay she kinda thicc
---
Very good list, but I feel it should address built-in game mechanics that make the game unenjoyable for both sides: camping, slugging, dcing, and farming to name a few obvious ones
---
RIP Feng. Must've had serious damage done from that impact D:
---
It makes it a less useful perk.
---
I just watched it happen twice, maybe its a bug then.
---
OH BAH GOD, SHE’S BROKEN IN HALF!!!
---
I personally would prefer to play Myers over Ghostface, play against Myers over Ghostface and until very recently I believed Myers was the better killer. 
---
If you haven’t seen it yet, check out OhTofu’s killer tier list, I know, tier lists, but it’s good and he makes some very interesting points on why Ghostface is superior in his current state!

“Right there, no there, wait I think there”

Blow me then, this community its pretty cool and helpful tbh.

no, of course not, just dumb complains
---
In the case of Hag spamming traps or Hillbilly revving his chainsaw to sprint back, both catch the unhooked survivor within a handful of meters of the hook immediately after the unhook.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hag because 6\~ meters is how far a crouching survivor gets from the hook before she can return from outside of her terror radius, 6 meters is **1.5 seconds** worth of distance if you were sprinting.
---
Hillbilly because a chainsaw sprint will let him reach the hook in just over **3 seconds** (technically this is 12 meters for a running survivor, but Hillbilly can continue sprinting and close that distance to 3 meters in another 1 second).
---
This is no different than Wraith sitting **right behind your hook** and uncloaking when someone starts to approach, since by default it only takes him **3 seconds** to uncloak.
---
You see how it is? Hag "proxying" with 5-6 traps that you can't get outside the trigger range by crouching before she returns and smacks you is **the exact same as Wraith facecamping**.
---
Hillbilly sitting 30 meters off charging his chainsaw? **The exact same as Wraith facecamping**.
---
They're not functionally different, all three allow the **KILLER TO BE RIGHT THERE WITHIN EITHER THREE SECONDS IN ACTUAL TIME OR BEFORE THE SURVIVOR COVERS THREE SECONDS WORTH OF DISTANCE.**
---
*Do you see how this could be an issue? If you approve of Hag proxy-camping with five traps, do you approve of Wraith facecamping? They are literally the same problem.*
---
/rant
---
TL;DR: Hag spamming traps isn't functionally different from Hillbilly chainsaw-proxying or Wraith facecamping, they literally do the same thing to the unhooked survivor; catching them under the hook without Borrowed Time.
---
I 100% agree with this. However they're not equal. Adrenaline is a reward for the survs doing gens. Noed is a reward for killers not pressuring enough. I don't want either one nerfed though because like you said people just need to do dull totems.
---
You and the other survivor players are looking at it too closely, genuinely surprised you didn't compare the perk icons or the fact that NOED can be cleansed.  
---
   
---
It's an endgame perk to give you an extra chance to complete your objective, thats the comparison and its pretty accurate.
---
Slugging is actually inherently toxic
---
cool!
---
*Epic Gamer moment*
---
In my eyes everything is useless, including you.
---
Kinda both as her add-ons are some BS but base nurse is fair so if it's a base nurse then as people say "git gud" but if it's a nurse with more then 2 blinks or long range blinks that's kinda bull
---
Up your arse, it’s my opinion on what it should be, a killer is 5$ so I think a skin should be less than that
---
Ohhh now I understand
---
Solution: Ranked and Casual mode
---
Ranked: No add-ons, no SWF, no offerings

Casual: Add-ons, SWF, and offerings

If you want to see the devil face with it then I can but it doesn't look great with it

He deserves a medal of honor
---
Did you make it obvious that you let him go
---
yeah maybe in rank 20
---
I'd personally like to see some clips or concept art of Ghostface in action.
---
Hillbilly is fun but can require a bit of practice due to his chainsaw and how it's properties work. For easy starting Killers, I'd recommend Myers, Clown, or Plague
---
I mean they are it gets better and better each uodate remember they are aiming for 60fps. It’s a hell of a lot better than back in the day
---
Ah, I wasn't sure if it was something missing off the lil glossary the sub has.
---
I do see OP was indeed just being a whiny bitch now.
---
I think because a ton of people just find him annoying due to how stealthy he is, and how he can almost always have an instadown ready if he set it up properly
---
Well I am inevitable so I win!

Your stats are very interesting and you raise some important points. Unfortunately you’ve not included any practicable solutions to the situation. The hags most powerful weapon is her traps, and their greatest effect is putting pressure on the hook. You’d neuter her and many other killers if they were forced to forgo using their ability. 
---
Your main question at the end deserves a response too. While your examples may be theoretically the same as a face camp, I argue they are functionally and practically different. In part there is a skill requirement to remaining at optimum range to teleport or chainsaw rush, while remaining at this distance allows for a significantly increased number of counterplays from the remaining survivors. For example, ‘Proxy campers’ will be much easier to bait into a chase than face campers. Also wily survivors at the hook will have the chance to scatter and confuse a killer in the time they do have, something that’s much less likely in a face camp situation. 
---
Finally I have a question of my own. Your first paragraph implies catching survivors is a bad thing. Isn’t that the point of the game from the killers perspective? If you can control the survivors you’re on the road to victory, then you can farm bp and pips if you’re interested in the meta game.
---
 I personally don’t agree with face camping for many reasons, but it’s also terribly inefficient. I do consider managing the hook to be a vital part of the gameplay for killers, and trapping altruistic survivors is absolutely key to the thrill of the game for both killers and survivors. Insisting killers leave the area despite the obvious threat seems both artificial and forced.
---
I think slugging is kind of toxic. There’s tactical slugging where it’s just the best thing to do at that moment and then there toxic slugging where you’re just being a dick. Hooks give bloodpoints and pips so there’s literally no reason to leave everybody slugged until bleedout unless you’re just trying to be a douche.
---
It's certainly the most unique bad take I've seen. I can see why people complain about stuff like NOED, tunneling, etc; But complaining about a killer *waiting* 2 seconds to hit you is just baffling.
---
Mainly you have to predict blinks by moving around debris, other than that just run
---
He plays for fun and to entertain his viewers, every time he plays with different builds, instead of the typical ruin,bbq,nurses or adrenaline,dh,sc ect
---
It wasn't deliverance because he's not broken. It wasn't slippery meat because he only tried 3 times. They could have Up the Ante I guess, but the odds of getting off the hook aren't that bad even without it.
---
His driver's license and victims detailed routine are basically shit "why aren't you out of your ability I'm looking at you clearly" and GFCT(Ghostface caught on tape) with chewed pen or drivers license is good.   basically all stalk increase, detection range decreases and ability recharge rate increases are great.    Since he is a M1 killer stuff like ruin and enduring, spirit Fury is great on him also heard nurses calling is good but haven't tried that out.    For playstyle don't play him like Myers stay out of sight and get behind cover to stalk and if they see you might as well try to stalk during a Chase and get exposed on them if you can also spine chill, premonition and OoO hard counter him .
---
Ever heard of deliverance?

BHVR devs buffed how often keys drop in chests. It's like they're begging for survivor dick.

Honestly waiting seems more like a big brain play than a baby killer move. I've never thought about just waiting the 360 out instead of swinging like the rank 16 killer I am lol.

thanks, im glad you like it! :D

Shes hot...  now i understand why Miky is always stalking her.

I second this

I hope they add emotes like this haha, that would be hilarious!

And I love YOU random citizen!

Idk why, but baby Dwight players always make me want to farm. Sometimes I'll purposefully play normally, just to keep the Dwight alive so we can farm together so he can work his way up to good perks/items. I can't get myself to kill them
---
DETECTIVE TAPP AND ADAM ARE BLACK AND YOU CAN STILL SEE THEM
---
Oof. That sucks personally for me I get the least amount of DCs as good ol John Wayne Gacy. Probably just a unlucky match also I recommend using the bleach add-on as it slows them down by  so damn much  also his purple add-ons are meh besides the more blur one.

i do not respect them they will die

THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED THEN

Good to know! I’m loading into my second hope it’s better! I want his teachable nonetheless but what good is a killer main that hasn’t at least played all killers? Honesty clown isn’t that appetizing to me but a guy from another thread said give him a chance
---
So basically anyone who wants to play with friends couldn’t earn exp to get shards for the shrine of secrets and skins? That would be awful
---
I encourage this

A shrug

The noob3 thing is funny but these are not true Dwight locker camping is just a meme, most Claudette s usually do help and aced usually just want to help out but you also forgot all other survivors so

Yea definitely give him a chance. Clown may be a mid tier killer but hitting direct bottles is such a good feeling also since he is weaker it feels more rewarding plus that damn smile he gives when reloading is so damn funny

Teabagging requires to lighten up?

What rank are you?

Then why did you ask for it?
---
Damn, the accuracy is too real. I've been swapping between red dead, gta, and dbd for the past 3 days, and I've been waiting for that chromeface skin to release to give me new motivation.
---
Played 4 hella salty games and went back to red dead lol. It's tough
---
You can hear bills smokers cough across map it's that bloody loud
---
Ik I'm just saying
---
You mean play the game how its supose and not chase the killer hm.
---
Accurate.
---
Playing violent video games evidently makes you really shit at killing.
---
Exactly! Play your RBTs right to apply pressure. Not to get kills, i find its a good swf counter cause they want their friend to live so it halts gens.
---
I hope so. I’m green ranks I thought I was past this. It’s beyond irritating lol

If you're on mobile, press the 3 vertical dots at the top right once you're viewing the DBD reddit, and press "Change user flair."

Well good luck on your adventures to play clown also tell me if you actually get a good match and your thoughts on him

It’s actually 9:49
---
Oh shit!
---
🖒
---
If someone disconnects from my game I give last survivor hatch and some free points.
---
Will do! I’m trying round 3 right now.
---
There is no more satisfying thing than to hook someone, hit someone, they run close to the gate, they teabag, then realizes it's blocked off
---
fuck dbd shitty ass game, upvote if you agree bitches
---
When it comes to teachable I only have the teachables from hag. I use earbuds but I only have one in at a time because I talk to my wife while I play which basically makes me deaf in one ear.
---
I bought flip flop for slugging nurses
---
Lol!!! Well depends, when do you graduate? Because I very well may be your doppelganger ;)
---
that makes literally no sense, how the fuck would you know they have BBQ if they are camping...?  unless you're talking about your team swarming the hook and he won't leave because of that if so it's on you for being an idiot
---
Me: *leaves 4 seconds before the timer hits the end*
---
End game:
---
Flip flop is ok against slugging
---
I honestly can't remember what's non teachables any more... uhh, Whispers is great, if you can master it theres no one that can hide from you. I actually love Spies from the Shadows - it's gotten me that last survivor more times than I can count. Sloppy Butcher is great for giving you a slight boost to survivor time wasted and helps with tracking from the blood. Iron Grasp is also good when you're first starting out and for countering Boil Over (really only annoying on console). After that... I really can't think of any others I'd recommend. Deerstalker I guess is decent too, but definitely in last place of these ones
---
Well good luck this conversation is getting long if you get some good matches make a post about it and gives your thoughts on clown
---
I've done a couple gen grabs on ghostface and BOY does that just make the DCs rain down
---
Yeah. I’m not particularly good with numbers but concepts come fairly easily to me.
---
PC, in-game: Playing as survivor against nurse, all 3 of my teammates escaped through door 1; I lingered a bit longer to get some extra points by blinding the killer, escaping the chase, when I got those, I then ran to the door's escape threshold and nothing happen (I believe the killer was bugged in place too, because they didnt move after I went back to the map  to try door 2, which did not work by the way, ended up dying to the entity sacrificing me (time ran out).
---
This is an unrealistic idea unfortunately. I do think people who DC should be suspended from queueing for a given amount of time. However, camping, slugging and farming are unavoidable in a game like this. You can disincentivise these things like the emblem debuff for example. The emblem debuff forces players who camp to lose rank, but there are players who do not care about rank. The emblem debuff also punishes players for farming off hooks, however, players who do not care about rank are not effected by this. Slugging and camping are sometimes necessary evils if a killer becomes desparate, like when the exit gates are opened and the killer hooks, but they definitely are not go to strategies. The only way to change these is to change the fundamental design of the game which just would not be DBD anymore. The majority of these, although they may feel like they are pretty common, are the smaller ends of things within the game. There are also answers to the majority of these things with other built in perks, such as unbreakable and borrowed time.
---
Just lvl up Hag, it's not that hard is it?
---
Yes.You are exactly right.It's completely random
---
I don't get why people think Nea is ugly. She's so pretty.
---
Bad post no hogs, let alone 30-50 of them :((((
---
I'm new, what is "3-genned"?
---
I GET IT, TUNNELING CAN BE A STRAT BUT IT'S A DICK MOVE. FUCK YOU IF YOU DO IT.
---
Otz is currently my favorite DBD streamer, there is nothing bad to say about the guy, except he uses otzcheats.com occasionally
---
I usually always thank the killer for letting me go through the hatch or letting me open the exit gate even though I’m a couple hundred hours in the game. I always appreciate a kind killer.
---
I’d love cosmetics showing Killers before they were twisted by the Entity. Adiris in all her glory would be one that comes to mind. For the Killers that wouldn’t make sense (Hag, Wraith, and Legion), maybe we see them in a more extreme or unique form. As for the Survivors, maybe an outfit that has strong meaning for them: Jeff’s first band t-shirt, Jane’s outfit from her interview at the radio station, etc. I don’t know if it would work out wonderfully, but I like the idea.
---
Backstory: All I asked was why they camped hatch and let the last survivor die on the hook. I didn't camp hook and wandered around looking for this survivor. Guess there's new rules?
---
This guy is 100% disabled ♿ that is a fact
---
I dont know I'd like to see all of them as people wraith and nurse weren't inherently bad people to begin with and seeing them as normal people before hand would be cool to me.
---
If you're thirsty for a kill, can you slug them and leave and will the timer keep ticking?
---
I disagree about the survivors ruining the killer's game. No matter what, the killer is there from beginning to end. Some survivors might not have the same experience.
---
Not even 1
---
yea u right
---
you can change the looks of the icons! the devs do say that there is a slight chance EAC might detect something and ban you but it hasn’t happened to anyone yet. it’s more of a do at your own risk type of thing. i personally have been using custom icons for more than 2 months and i haven’t been banned so it’s your decision really
---
Then the week after that, 
---
More disappointment
---
That’s true, maybe seeing them as people in a image or cutscene ish thing would be best.
---
I'd probably say make it an exhaust perk
---
Ah cool, is there a video which is accurate on how to put them in?
---
Worst feeling when you’ve been looking for a solid minute and get hooked only to see no one even ON a generator
---
Ye
---
I just want console optimization. That is literally all I want. Been waiting since release.
---
I was waiting for this meme to resurface from this weeks shrine disappointment, guess it’s back to basement time with insidious Bubba...

Love it

WHY THE FUCK ARE SURVIVORS STILL PULLING YOU OFF THE HOOK WHEN THE KILLER IS TWO FEET BEHIND THEM.

I never understand why people can harass genuinely new players, they're doing their best come on people :(
---
I do have a thing for chubby guys SO YES PLEASE
---
I remember when I first really started to play this game, I was matched with people way better than me and I was terrible. Many survivors and killers would send me a lot of hate but there was always few that would help me out. That’s what kept me playing.

7 page decisive strike

Fuckin nyoooom
---
Did you have to kill him?
---
Lmao what rank is this killer?
---
Same
---
Start with 2 tokens, same sort of way that Distortion works or maybe earn the tokens after a safe unhook/protection hit with a max of two tokens per game
---
apparently t-bagging is so toxic it makes people miserable. Seriously that's just pathetic.
---
Myers is really fun! His add ons can totally change his play style so he’s a fairly versatile killer.
---
I agree with you.  10 bucks is way too much. 1 buck for a brown, 2 for a yellow, 3 for a green, 5 for yellow. That's how this junk should be.
---
No thank you.
---
That seems like it would be a balanced perk. It would also be some what valuable compared to the current meta like Adrenaline
---
Yeah rank 20 is ez
---
That being said if the person with the RBT is the only person you find, it is still worth chasing (compared to dropping it and trying to find someone else) especially if they're injured as you can get them even closer to a sacrifice and force someone to make the save. But if you find 2 people and 1 has the RBT, it's better to go after the one without it.  My point is that it's better to be chasing someone than ignoring an easy hook just because they have a rbt
---
wasting pallets like it’s no tomorrow, at least loop one.
---
I just know it’d be fun as a survivor to run a locker build but aids to play against as the killer
---
Mmm...

   That voice~

No. The timer won’t continue while they are in a chase, hooked, or downed.

Yep. When I think it's a 3 man SWF, I dodge. No regrets.

I see. Hmm I've thought about that too but he seems like ghostface but better/worse depending on how you look at it.  Do his perks help other killers when you get him to 35?

Thanks man for your input!

I'm actually content with being a potato killer...

You can probably easily get that by just waiting two inches from the exit gate and letting the killer down you

Girlfriend got it tonight, we've been playing together the past week taking turns, and it was honestly so badass.
---
Good job!
---
Oof
---
Well, I do play "normally" the first part of the game...  
---
When I down them and they would be dead on hook, I let them free. It's like "you would be dead now, but I let you live".  
---
Wow, now that I wrote my thoughts out, it sounds kinda condescending and douchey of me. xD
---
Isn't Hag free on all platforms?
---
Yoo!! Tell her i said congrats. It is badass!!
---
You will never reach the exit !
---
Honestly it could be a client side glitch
---
Congratulations to you too!
---
Nice
---
NO well unless there was a free weekend or something that I totally missed because my WiFi is dead (I'm on phone data rn)
---
Yeah i tried that. Didnt work out so well for me but oh well XD
---
Thanks!! 😄😄
---
In ps4 she is always free
---
No worries :)
---
Oh well I'm on PC so rip
---
Never go alone seems busted, I'd change tough as nails to turn medium vaults into fast vaults instead of just an increased speed on token consumption, makes it more versatile imo
---
How many layers of satan would it be to intentionally go for the person who got sandbagged to get them pissed off at their teammate?
---
I like Ghostface too but Myers stalk is a lot easier to build up in my opinion. I’d say his best perk is Save the Best for Last. Gives a successful attack cooldown of up to 40 percent with max tokens. Really helpful for M1 killers in general. I run it on Freddy and it really helps keep pressure on survivors.
---
You're welcome
---
What
---
Well, yeah... I mean, there are "rules" like "dont tunnel" etc... while I agree, that these are not hard written rules, I still see that as a dick move (I dont want to be a dick :( ) .  
---
Maybe I'm too much of a wuss for this game? I'm a killer that doesnt want to kill anyone and just wants everyone to be happy.
---
I crawl my way out almost every day after teabagging the killer at the exit, just let him down you right at the exit, he wont have a chance to pick you up.
---
So this is where she learned self care
---
Hes obviously talking about the art style
---
I have said for so long she needs to be a survivor. And if not her then it needs to be Lee.
---
This is one of the easiest achivements to get in the game...
---
Different people just like different things. I can understand people might not like how Nea looks even if I think she looks fine.
---
What I don't get is why people complain about it and ask for her face to be 'reworked'. Like, if you don't like Nea you don't have to play her; there are plenty of other Survivors to pick from.
---
Thanks for your input people. :)  
---
I actually thought I would be blamed for my play style, since some people tend to diss me after the matches. :(  
---
Have a nice day!
---
And what about nea
---
I’m just trying to learn the damn game man leave me alone :( *cries on rank20 killer*
---
As to you,  my friend
---
It's not a problem with survivor power, the issue is with killers being too weak and easy to bully. 
---
If killers were much stronger it would even make sense to buff some of the less useful survivor perks

This paints a pretty picture of Ash riding a horse getting ready to lasso up a bear.

Everytime I get sandbagged the killer still chases me. Tuff out here.
---
I'm just imagining a muffled
---
" What the fuck? "
---
I’m down to test this theory.😂😂😂
---
Played a good, but long game as plague. Puked on everyone passing by, dropped chases once I infected a little, hooked then immediately went to go pop goes the weasel any gen they'd be working on, down the person at that gen, repeat.
---
I couldn't believe it. And yes it was a 4k with 12 hooks. I can show you the 4k but I don't know how I could capture the fact I hooked them all 3 times.
---
I didn't even tunnel
---
Very lol I learned the hard way
---
I mean... why wouldn't the killer stand there to see if she unhooked herself?  That's just playing smart.
---
Base is 4% but it feels higher.
---
Yup this game seriously need some rework on this kind of shit especially
---
IDK, do you have "family emergencies" every other game?  Or just every game you play against a Spirit?
---
I freaking love this give this to r/walkingdeadgame
---
Addons actually make or break like 90% of killers. Imagine Trapper or Clown without addons? They go from barely useful to actually viable with the right addons.
---
Basically only Nurse is fine with or without addons.
---
Literally me
---
Exactly didn't loop car pallet at all and just dropped it  not even a single damn loop.
---
what was his name?  he seems nice, and when new players stop coming and the game dies we know who to blame.
---
I have an idea for a new killer:
---
The doll
---
(Now just watch and wait a few months/years down the line then remember to come back here when it happens)
---
Fucking hilarious bug
---
&gt; after teabagging the killer at the exit 
---
   I hate you sir
---
Because you have 3 tries.
---
I mean sometimes you gotta play weird to find these ghosts posing as players. I’ve had to change my game of being super proactive and pressuring while also whipping around or just pausing for a second.  
---
Pausing really helps in he 8-12 ranks I find. People just don’t realize that they’re in the open around that rank. Just a breather sometimes shows that bush you see in the distance is crouch walking.
---
I think it'd be a grab and bite on the neck, followed by the survivor collapsing to the ground whilst screaming in agony while Walker Lee proceeds to eat the survivor alive.
---
There's a bit of a story here actually.
---
Way back in October of last year, they said that they were working to get cosmetics for licensed characters. And at that time tons of people were talking about the upcoming Halloween movie and asking if there'd be related cosmetics.
---
The devs might have been talking about the Saw outfits, but it does seem a little odd they wouldn't just say, "we have no plans to get Halloween cosmetics at this time" since that's what most people were asking about.
---
Later, during one of the PTBs, dataminers found empty folders in the storefront for Laurie and Michael cosmetics. At that time no licensed character had folders for cosmetics within the storefront because no licensed characters had purchaseable cosmetics; so it seemed like a significant find.
---
Additionally, Laurie and Michael were both featured on the front page of the store for several months; a spot usually reserved for new characters.
---
To me that all indicates that *something* **was** going to happen for our beloved Halloween characters, but didn't: for one reason or another.
---
Sometimes it takes a hook to hang you up.
---
That's a great mori idea but what about perks and ability?
---
Unrelated comment, but I think Carver would fit better. Walker Lee is too depressing and doesn't make much sense.
---
Sorry no Witch Hunt on him. I believe that he was just really tired after couple of loses in the row and that might be the reason why he was so angry/toxic.
---
Unpopular opinion: I purposely leave my profile comments open just so I can receive their pathetic salt and mock them
---
He needs additional abilities outside the chainsaw on top of add ons, or give his chainsaw more versatility. Some kind of permanent passive effects would be nice.
---
I really like that insta-mori chainsaw, balancing that would be pretty difficult.
---
The rev-addons wouldn't do much as rev the chainsaw pretty is pretty much a signal flair for survivors to do whatever they want since you'll be powerless for 10 seconds, unless you find one potato survivor or get lucky in a chase
---
how the fuck you bringing ultra rare offerings as survivor
---
Looks like the Killer's ready to play.
---
I can't imagine actually doing this, 3-4 man SWF are 90% of my games so I'd be dodging more than I'm playing.
---
One of these perk names needs to be changed to "Still Not Bitten" I'd fucking kill for Clem as a survivor
---
Rip NOED, it would make that perk completely worthless
---
I hear you lol. I’m running devour hope and trying to get it to 5 tokens. I sprint away from the hook! And still get angry messages about camping. It’s absurd.
---
Same man,I'm a killer main and its telling me be chased with bill,my bill is legit lvl 1
---
Which map is that
---
Can we just talk about the fucking arm strength it would take to yeet a dog that far?
---
Coldwind Thompson House
---
&gt;I'm honestly not used to both playing this game AND feeling good about it. Super weird.
---
That gets me. Reading that brings to mind those really tough days you have and when you turn to gaming as a way to relax or unwind. Those days where you really just want to have some fun and take your mind off of your responsibilities but the games end up being super stressful and the players are super toxic. That really breaks you.

---
This show was fucking weird
---
it has the highest chance of spawning rare items
---
Honestly don’t get why people are downvoting you. It’s DEAD by Daylight not Friends by Daylight. If u don’t want to give mercy that’s perfectly fine (hell you’re not even supposed to anyway)
---
There's so many individual parts of the emblem system that are broken.  "Chases won" - uh, what?  Juggling is literally one of the best strategies against good survivors but LOL UR BAD if you use it, I guess.  I'm just surprised you actually got a gold Gatekeeper at that rank.
---
Tbh same. I used to give someone the hatch every time someone DCed but someone DCs almost every damn game, I’ve started just not caring.
---
Maybe she was standing still while looking up before she AFKd?
---
Replace resilience with spine chill to know when the killers coming and when he is looking at you in a chase and maybe Replace Sprint Burst with hope
---
It's getting a skill check right as you decide to pop off, just rotten luck.
---
He revived the New Moon Bouquet?!? Hell yeah boiiiiii
---
What does the boot perk do ?
---
Hag and Spirit have way different playstyles  tbh.
---
Someone's planning to beat their meat, home alone.
---
If they do a Telltale Walking Dead chapter, which I’m sure they never will, it’d be amazing if they used Lee because lore wise he’d fit perfectly since similar to Bill what happened to him is left ambiguous.
---
When you were a Freddy main and he was lev 50 but then the rework drops and you hate him “ years of academy training, WASTED!”
---
HELL YEAH BUSH TIME
---
LF's real problem is that his chainsaw is complete booty.  He moves slower when revving it which removes pretty much every single mindgame you could possibly do with it.  The penalty for bumping into something (which Leatherface is WAY more likely to do at a bad time) is absolute murder - it's basically the killer losing the survivor completely.  
---
If they just made LF have Billy's chainsaw mechanics (IE bump penalty isn't that bad and can be reduced significantly with addons, revving doesn't slow you at all) and maybe bumped up his acceleration when chainsawing he'd actually be pretty decent.
---
Nah
---
Just run stridor
---
They still get the points don’t they? He could have just put them back on the hook and ended it that way. Would they get more points for that?
---
I personally like the DLC for legion (he's not very good, but I find him fun). My friend really likes Myers.
---
From where I was looking at first I was like "Why the hell is Nea AFK and what is she looking at?"
---
This was me earlier today.  I dodged, ducked, dipped, dived, and dodged my way out of a Huntress chase, but I was injured.  Fast forward 40 seconds and a teammate is looping her.  Runs into the building I'm in and runs her right up to me at the generator. 
---
 Of course she was excited to have an easy target, so she abandoned him completely and hooked me.  Did I mention she hooked me in the basement and then stood upstairs the entire duration until I was dead?  Fun times.  I love solo survivor.
---
I was getting mostly 4k in my games as him and actually had my only nice message from a Survivor saying that I was a great Freddie
---
You're ignoring that PH doesn't need to carry that sword AND he also has the option of using a huge ass spear.
---
"Pyramid Head is slow" yeah, tell that to James in the hospital corridor lol
---
I try to stay in purple and green ranks where they aren't so abundant.
---
I just saw a comment about a bubba that was memeing the basement chest. May have been you hold on lmao.

I tbag with the survivors as ghostface.
---
u/Chronoist 
---
This you lmao
---
Are you my twin?  The worst is when a teammate sandbags you, and you die on your first hook as a result... AFTER you saved every survivor on your team from the hook at least once.  Feelsbad.
---
Years of academy training, wasted!
---
When performing a fast vault or leaving a locker in a sprint, you leave no Scratch Marks for 3 seconds.
---
Ahhhhh, another “ex-Freddy main”

"Omae wa mou shindeiru"

"What the fu-"
---
We never gonna get it though. I just know. Its the things people don't ask for that we get. I mean, who really asked for Ash Williams from that tv show?
---
Using collision is either super lucky or not mindless. Everything the spirit does in the ethereal plane is an educated guess to some degree. Just saying the odds of someone phase shifting and bumping into a survivor in the middle of nowhere are pretty minimal. Most likely that happens at a gen, pallet, loop, whatever that would attract a survivor.
---
They talk to the owners of the character (or mask for Ghostfaces case) and they work out a deal with how much they have to pay for him etc and if they want to add cosmetics for them they ask again for permission then add the cosmetic set.
---
What kind of monster would hook Clementine.
---
Playing as killer I've had this happen. I feel bad for the survivors so I just step away at that point and just let them do it.
---
I got scared haha.
---
They bought the rights to use them in the game.
---
They don't own the characters but either they or the owners approached one another and devs said hey if you let us add this we will give you some % of the profits on this characters sales.
---
So the people give them the right to use it in exchange for said money.
---
So I've noticed. I came into spirit trying to play like I did with hag but that went horribly wrong lol
---
stab a bunch of people with frenzy and when you hit the last person you can see stay in frenzy and chase them until their speed boost runs out then snap out of frenzy. That way they don't get as much ground while you are recovering.
---
Why Otz isn't a Fog Whisperer.
---
Probably a decent rank, but just letting the man go and drop all pallets so they won’t be an issue later tbh
---
you’re just not high enough
---
It’s for laughs, he wasn’t actually salty.
---
Once someone was especially kind to me and I accidentally exited out of the screen before I could message them and I was V UPSET. ...it still makes me sad I never got to thank them for being so awesome
---
Supposedly.
---
Hes a cunt
---
r/stardewvalley
---
Not supposedly for fucking sure it is
---
Well I was downed and another person was around we were SWF so I just said “Look for the hatch” he didn’t find it and the legion grabbed me up and let me wiggle them he killed me afterwards he found the hatch, but my friend escaped via exit gates. He joined our party to tell us he was a bad teammate for not saving me. I told him it was the strat since he was using me as bait and he got mad and left.
---
Do you want some?
---
- Legion is one of if not the best stalling killer in the game. A build like Sloppy, Thanatophobia, and Ruin really puts the game to a halt when you start chaining hits. They're not great at closing a game but they're certainly able to drag it out to get the opportunity if played well. 
---
- Run double duration add-ons for the best possible setup. You'll get the most benefit from these, trust me. Cool down add-ons are alright too. 
---
- A little known fact with Frenzy is that you can lunge with it. This helps to ensure you land the hit, and you need to land the hit.
---
- Vaulting over windows or pallets without Bamboozle or Iridescent Button is actually fairly slow. Depending on the loop the survivor may just be able to vault again before you can catch up to them. Usually best to go around if possible.
---
- Don't Frenzy just for mobility. If you're not getting hits with Frenzy you're just a pure M1 killer. Use it when you see a survivor and know you can land a hit.
---
- Before you go for downs, try to get everyone injured first. They'll be tempted to heal, but if you can consistently keep them injured this will be a major waste of time for them. Keeping them constantly mending and injured is crucial to Legions gameplay.
---
The nurse and Billy they won't touch I can guarantee that the nurse hasn't been touched to change much since her release because either she will be severely underpowered or too overpowered. And a full rework like Freddy won't work because the blink how would you change that along with her lore from a story point thers not much you can do
---
Hillbilly was one of the original 3 killers. It really wouldn’t make sense to rework his power after 3 years.
---
&gt; She has collision with survivors when she's using her power, the player can use this to mindlessly check for survivors while they are invisible and there isn't anything the survivor can do about it. It's especially useful at pallets, just phase through to figure out on which side the survivor is standing.
---
Ah yes...Spirit players are wasting their power on checking for survivors using collision when they could be using their eyes. Literally no one uses phasing to do this
---
Supposedly kiss my ass. Supposedly.
---
Looks like someone has been watching Saminations
---
if a killer DCs very fast into the game you depip
---
They are actually taking a look at Nurse's add-ons next patch.
---
You don’t need a counter because it doesn’t work 99% of the time.
---
OH BOY. DO I HAVE A STORY TO TELL YOU.
---
I WAS JUST IN A MATCH, RIGHT? AGAINST LEGION. I BROUGHT MY BEST MED KIT ALONG. I WAS OWNING. LIKE I WAS POPPING OFF RIGHT. I GOT MY SAVES, I DID MY GENS. THEN I GOT SLICED. DEEP WOUND, YOU KNOW? SO I WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY TO MEND MYSELF, AND HEALING MYSELF AFTERWARDS WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN A LITTLE JIFFY, WITH MY NICE ASS MED KIT, RIGHT?!?!
---
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA WRONG U FUCKERS.
---
THE GAME MUST HAVE BUGGED, BECAUSE I COULD NOT MEND
---
OR HEAL
---
MYSELF
---
AT ALL. SO THERE I WAS, THE LAST SURVIVOR WAS ON THEIR LAST HOOK, AND I KNEW WHERE THE HATCH WAS. I BEGAN TO RUN TOWARDS IT. IN HOPE I COULD MAKE IT IN TIME
---
BUT HAHAHAHHAHAHA BAKANA...
---
I HAD TO CRAWL MY ASS OVER THERE
---
BECAUSE STUPID
---
DBD
---
AND ITS SHITTY ASS GAME
---
(WHICH I LOVE SO MUCH)
---
ITS JUST
---
A STINKY BAG OF POO
---
AND I WAS SO CLOSE TO THE HATCH RIGHT
---
I SAW IT
---
STARTED CRAWLING TOWARDS IT
---
BOOOOOOMLEGIONSTOMPSPALLET
---
INMYSTUPIDASSFACE
---
SO THERE U GO BEHAVIOR. YOU COST ME A WIN WITH YOUR SHITTY ASS BUGS, YOU HAPPY NOW?! IM REPORTING YOU.
---
(PLAYS ANOTHER GAME ANGRILY)
---
Found the gen tapper
---
That wasn’t Jen. Jens much smarter, and with her game sense would know that the heartbeat nullified the phase sound. Her only flaw is that she just can’t handle not winning.
---
Look up How to play Spirit guides on YouTube or find YouTubers who are good at Spirit and watch their playstyle. Also bring perks that center around what you're bad at and level all the killers you have to level 40 to get their teachables.
---
I'm not sure what kind of games you're playing but in my recent games I can't blink when they're flashing yellow flashlights in my face with brown add-ons even after I look away.
---
Great idea but the ratings board doesn’t take to kindly to on screen death of minors, especially brutal ones like gettin moried
---
I'm on android need help making stuff into alarms
---
How about we talk about how captain k'nuckles yeeted an innocent dog into vicious ocean water because flapjack wasn't paying attention to him
---
im not on enough layers of irony to tell if this is a joke
---
Thanks for the heads up yo!
---
Had multiple games disconnect (I was killer and didn't DC on purpose or anything) and then it wouldn't let me connect anymore. 3 games. DCed. So that'll be fun for killer rank. Just wanted to complete a daily ritual :(
---
Look if I think that slugging the second to last survivor I need to kill is the best call for the situation why can't I do that? Or if I think something else requires my attention at the moment instead of hooking the person I just downed. Or maybe let people play how they want as long as they don't cheat or break game rules eh? Let me slug when I need to and let the rank 20 wraith camp. It might be annoying sure, but I think loops are annoying, yet I acknowledge that it takes skill to use correctly and that there is counterplay that I can use to mind game the survivor.
---
You do realize you're talking about something entirely different now, right?
---
First you said "oh you need to aim the flashlight at her she's charging her second blink to stun her" which I said was incorrect and then say reply with this.
---
Yes, if you aim the flashlight on nurse when she isn't blinking she won't get the prompt to blink (which doesn't even really matter at all because the fl only has so much charges in it and you can blink the rest of the match completely fine).
---
I’m always there for the fun of the killer and player 👍 check out my stream and add me sometime! t.tv/lord_steven
---
Hey did he put you on the basement by any chance
---
I wouldnt say lockers are OP at all. The killer is just clueless... He should've saw the blood infront of your locker
---
Halloween is my favorite movie and I love Laurie, but if this comes out I'm gonna have a new main
---
Never go alone is too strong. It doesn't exhaust you so you could chain it into the other exhaustion perks.
---
We already have detectives hunch which doesn't get traps but has a much bigger range and more potential as it can activate several times per trial
---
Bruh
---
I had to check multiple times to make sure, but yes. This is what the issue is.
---
I feel the same. But I would change it to only detect totems ( maybe active ones and chests with increased cleansing and searching speed?)and not traps. Lets not forget that killers like trapper already suffer from time efficiency and having a perk to cripple their late game doesnt sound nice.
---
I had to triple check to see it wasn't me, or DBD specifically.
---
Everything with spirit is perfectly fine lol. She’s got counter and you can mind. Another thing is she’s in basic skin her shards of glass glow white when phasing. However I really do wish she had a vaulting animation.
---
When the Jason game flops completely, we can get him!
---
My fav part about it if you beat them YOU are always the one ruining the game XD
---
Shit always happens when I am swinging at a survivor and I miss. Like what the hell. Pisses me off.
---
You ps4??? Cause I was in a game, same map, same killer, same problem around the same time lol
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cnhlt2/bug_on_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

He’s been getting stream sniped by the same guy for the last fifteen days dude
---
RNG... 
---
Killers are far more likely to find the Hatch first, because they don't have to be stealthy to find it.
---
But please, keep turning your 5% of failure into 0%.
---
And don't forget the AK next time someone invites you to play football! ;)
---
The first perk is questionable because with faster vault speeds your medium vaults would be as fast as fast vaults meaning you can hug walls and still get fast vault speed despite you messing up your angles. Interesting but odd. 
---
Second perk is borderline OP. It either needs to be an exhaustion perk and follow exhaustion rules, or non-stacking/have the Prove Thyself caveat because if this ticks down like Hope does, this is just nuts cause you can basically get other people’s activations and keep chases going by simply Go-Kart Drifting off people. 
---
Last perk is a weaker Detective’s Hunch that also says “hey you didn’t bother looking for totems during the game and instead of you getting punished by NOED, here’s a constant 24m totem finder to fall back on for two minutes.” 
---
Lastly the survivor choice is questionable cause Mori’s and gore on a child is definitely not it, chief.
---
And this folks, is why you look behind you at all times; even when you're looking forward.
---
As survivor I love using Alert and Urban Evasion. Killer can’t catch what they can’t find.
---
Indeed it is a weird flex
---
That's right 😂
---
Sorry master for not following your rules about how the game should be played! Please don't hurt me, don't make me sleep outside again! I'm sorry for trying to win... I won't do it again!
---
Off I go killing again!
---
The problem is it's only 24 meters, the range would need to be at least as big as empathy is now.
---
Yo thanks man, really appreciate it
---
Low level SWF are mostly the same as any other low level player. They are just SLIGHTLY more coordinated. But still bad at looping. Unless you are facing rainbow SWF teams with some red ranks tossed in with potatos. And yeah that situation sucks since red rank survivors can often be good enough that they can bully the hell out of anything thats not a nurse or spirit. My advice for those situations just look for their potato friend(s) because they will be easier to chase down. Usually there is a huge and easily noticeable gap between the high rank SWF player and their potato friend.
---
Honestly the only way to deal with is play as much of a cunt you can if the swf are trying to bully you so camp them don't give them time to organize, anger them so they make mistakes have no mercy at all but seriously if they aren't sweaty just have fun with them.
---
Yea, over all 3 tries it averages out to an 11.5% chance.
---
When you have a Mori ready either by Offering or Devour Hope, the survivor will have to be downed first and there will be a button prompt that comes up that says “Kill” (I’m on PS4 so I don’t know which button you may specifically use) but when you have the offering, it’ll actually appear on screen to remind you “Hey you have a Mori, may as well use it”
---
You crouch as fast as survivors walk.
---
Oh my god... J.. Jake? Is that you?
---
&gt;deny safe unhooks
---
So camp and tunnel everybody that gets hooked and hope that the unhooker isn't using Borrowed time every single game, got it.
---
&gt;and protection hits
---
How exactly? If the survivor bodyblocks when you are carrying someone to the hook or stands around the downed survivor, you're gonna have to swing at them.
---
&gt;the problem wasn't so much getting the extra hit
---
No the extra hit was definitely a major part of that, it's a free instaheal.
---
solid meme. can i get the format?
---
WHERE DO YOU PLAY IN ORDER TO HAVE SURVIVOR QUEUES THAT HIGH? I PLAY ON PC ON EU AND SURVIVOR QUEUES ARE ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS, WHILE KILLER QUEUES ARE ALWAYS 5+ MINUTES.
---
I got hardcore juked by this one guy (and cucked out of two hooks which he raced me to in order to break them) and I was just so dumbfounded I went and opened the door for them when it was available. I know and respect when I'm beaten, lol.
---
thanks
---
Cute but she looks way too young imo.
---
Vanilla.
---
Yeah, this happened a lot when I played on PS4 as well. Obviously they can't comment on your page but I would get a lot of messages. I was trying to get all of my adepts and he called me a "cheesing neckbeard Nea" because get this... I looped him.I deadass asked him to list how I cheesed and he said looping. **B R U H**
---
Looooooool. Well I've complained a lot among my friends circle, but I was sick of not having my voice heard (Cause it was never there). I just wanted to make changes that hopefully everyone enjoys within the game and just hope the devs see it.
---
I’ve see. Plenty of Michaels, GF, billys, anyone with insta downs with noed.
---
I’m not taking that chance that I get killed on my first hook by a trash killer that relies on noed for kills, I’m getting that dull totem.
---
Maybe the guy is in the same ranks dude. If you don't want to be stream sniped either delay your stream or quit streaming. Don't cry about it.
---
Woohoo! Thanks for the heads up man :)
---
Hey, I've seen this one!
---
Literally just happened to me. Not being to emote is an indictor of this glitch being active so if I cant emote I just insta leave
---
You never actually see him die on screen. Same with Bill. It’s obvious in the lore of their games that they die but of course the entity pulled Bill in before that happened and could do the same for Lee. It gets a bit touchy with Telltale since there are obviously multiple endings but if they would ever do a character from those games they obviously would have to have a canon path for their lore.
---
I AGREE. I ALSO DONT EXPECT TO WIN EVERY GAME BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO IMPROVE WHEN I GET FOUND FIRST PRACTICALLY EVERY GAME WITH SHITTY TEAMMATES WHO JUST FARM ME AND GET MATCHED WITH EVERY KILLER WHO TUNNELS AND/OR CAMPS THE HOOK. GRR
---
THE RANKING SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE AND I WISH THE DEVS WOULD JUST DELETE IT!  
---
IT'S SO WORTHLESS!  
---
SKILL? NO! I WAS FACECAMPED BY MULTIPLE INFINITE TIER 3 MYERS FOR RUNNING HIM AROUND FOR 4 GENS AND DEPIP! I ALSO FACED A KILLER SO BAD I DEPIPPED! IT'S ALSO NOT SKILL BASED WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR RANK FROM A KILLER DCING, FIX YOUR RANK BULLSHIT OR REMOVE IT FROM THE GAME DEVS!!!
---
One time I immediately found noed totem of the prayer beads spirit with ebony mori. She wasn’t happy that her clutch perk was destroyed but she managed to down the nea that had been looping her all game because I could finish cleansing it. Nea, if you read this, you did so good, soz I physically could not cleanse the totem any faster
---
I do it if I know I'm not going to double pip for whatever reason
---
Casual mode would be fun. They could add an in game chat that both survivors and killers could choose to join
---
Yeah and like I said in my previous comment I’m completely fine with the strategy it just makes me cringe when killers act like that’s not what they did because we all know if you have to proxy camp 24/7 then you aren’t that good of a killer.
---
Nah, your wall of text is actually helpful.
---
I'd like to start with nurse, but before I even switch I need other killers's perks. Starting with BBQ.
---
I don't teabag unless the killer tunnels/camps me
---
Honestly, I prefer Lee or Kenny over clementine. 
---
But that's just my opinion
---
If only we could get a walking dead update, I'd think that Clem, Lee, or perhaps Rick would make great survivors
---
In all seriousness, he probably saw that you were running NOED
---
Why?
---
The kit is plenty cohesive, he just doesnt rely on a single ability like most other killers. All of Freddie's abilities rotate around pushing for early to mid game map control. If anything his perks dont make sense anymore.
---
Holding refers to when you have it primed and ready.
---
Charging is a different thing.

Hell yeah I think that would be amazing.. I think the only other issue would be people farming blood.. so maybe they just would need to half the max perfect score.. so instead of a 32k.. you get 16k or maybe even 8k... so the only reason to do it would be to play without care for ranks pretty much. And chilled dailies
---
All good bro ur playstyle sounds fine to me, just might get boring for yourself after a while if u want a challenge
---
I swear they put the most broken add-ons too.
---
What the fuck
---
Video: https://youtu.be/VV4zZIBiQo4
---
it’s interesting to think about the mindset of players like you, how people strive to play specific games longer regardless of repetition or boredom at times in a strive to commit themselves to be more experienced at a game. I did so myself with For Honor, and even now as I see what may have been a waste now, it was time well spent for me as I had fun doing it. 
---
Sorry, just a little rant because I’m jealous I can’t get into DBD like you can, it’s a rather fun game, especially killer. 
---
Happy for you tho, it’s a nice achievement.
---
D-Strike
---
Better wording would be "What to fuck" and the answers would be clownerinos donger
---
This is true survivors just insta loop you and abuse pallets. And the pallet hitbox is completely broken.
---
Scroll farther my friend
---
What do you mean you've seen it? It's brand new!
---
They should take Samsung's example and call it a feature.

Why is this so funny

BEEEEEEEETCH
---
Don't have friends who play this game.
---
Ackhsually, you can only get up to very rare addons with ace in hole
---
The Entity has chosen a new main for you, now you must become a Jake main and sabotage all the hooks.
---
The best shit-eating grins are reserved for when the last one alive steps on a trap when you play Trapper.
---
Very true, as the cycle would be broken if all the perks were good for once.
---
yep you're right, it's a megamind reference
---
I'm the exact opposite way. I always have my survivor rank at 13 or below. I usually just play SWF too because solo Q is pain
---
Sometimes my friends are potatoes. Sometimes I'm a potato. Lots of reasons not to SWF. But I know how it feels to be in solo queue and have potato teammates every game. Matchmaking doesn't help either.
---
Somehow I always wanted this to happen to me,but my Paranoia of not hearing the killers terror Radius as me looking in all directions and if a bird flies or I hear the killer’s steps or GhostFace Wind.
---
I’m running.
---
The second someone tries to struggle off I’ll let em go and wait. If they start to run, they die. If they understand and wait for me, I’ll either let them look for it or lead them to it like a mama duck
---
SURVIVORS THAT RUN WE’RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER CAN GO FUCK THEMSELVES, AND THIS PERK NEEDS TO GO AWAY. IT INCENTIVIZES FARMING. I KEEP BEING FARMED BY ASSHOLES RUNNING THIS PERK WHO CARE ONLY ABOUT POINTS.
---
Yep, she is OP as hell in a good hands. You can juke around lesser nurse, not red rank nurse.
---
What is that from? It seems familiar, but I can't place it
---
I'll probably graduate with my master's degree October next year. I really only have my thesis, two oral exams, and two course works left to do. So excited to finally be done. And you?
---
Yea and the items survivors get are powerful too. Difference is, nothing can stop a mori other than winning. There are mulitple ways to counter items.
---
360 WAITING KILLER HAHAHAHAHA CLASSIC
---
This.
---
I had already closed the hatch (otherwise I'd never have found the last survivor lol) when I found the last girl standing (living). She tried to open the exit gate. I downed her a few metres away from it and then thought "hey, she played stealthy, altruistically and got gens done, she deserves to escape".
---
I proceeded to walk up to the exit gate and let her wiggle out in front of it (there were several hooks close by so she should've gotten it). Even slapped the damn exit gate.
---
Instead, she ran away, pretending like I'm some random killer. Pff. I then killed her.
---
O.o that's nuts
---
His DC was just for comedic timing. He never DCs normally.
---
Plague is an A-Tier killer imo
---
Pop is a lot better than sloppy at higher ranks as it doesn't do nything to stop gens. Ooo is probably up there with ruin for one of the best gen stopping perks
---
I was under the impression that it didn’t stack but I still thought it would be op to do this (you would need four man swf)
---
perks: (everyone takes these)
---
never go alone
---
Tough as nails
---
Resilience 
---
Dead hard or hope
---
Tactic:
---
Once tough as nails is stacked to max start chase once you get injured you have 20% faster vault speed now teammates will go to you to give you haste then leave like 15-25 seconds later another survivor comes and puts haste back on repeating the cycle
---
 hope vs dead hard
---
if you have hope you have a 16% percent speed boost along with 20% faster vault speed in end game 
---
with dead hard you are able to prolong the chase for longer at anytime if you use it right
---
(This is how stupid This would be without your imposed nerf)
---
what a gentleman, giving dwights the hatch
---
But ranks dont matter...
---
Is it really the hard to cleanse 5 totems ? 😂
---
that neck tho
---
That is the correct thing to do. If she don’t want saving then she gets the pain
---

I've never had this exact message but stuff like "ez match lol" or "gg ez". I've started pretending that I think ez is a compliment  I reply with "Oh thanks!!! Ez to you too!!!" Or "thanks! Ez!!!:)".
---
They usually are just too tired to explain what they actually meant.
---
Camping is the worst thing you could do as a new player.  You won't learn how to play the game doing that which means average to good opponents will continue to wreck you.  Camping will only work against a team of 4 potatoes.  Decent survivors will simply punish you with a genrush on your way towards a depip.  There are a ton of videos on YouTube and twitch  of quality killer players.  I'd start there.
---
Those first 2 perks are fucking busted
---
Magic.
---
Really wish it didn't have the tassels flowing around him. Theres no point using anything other than the raincoat because it the most  stealth of his outfits and actuality looks most like he looks in the films.
---
My average game search is \~2-3 minutes. Dodging is not an option :(
---
This exactly happened to me last time I played, in the same order and everything.
---
You say it's the least played but remember that's at all ranks so I'd say out of everyone playing the odds are low but at low ranks it's almost every game
---
The fuck?
---
You can hear the sound
---
Sends you to one of 5 variations of that realm/map
---
It’s an Offering that gives you an ALMOST guaranteed chance to go to that particular Map
---
Neas are teams lifesavers for real
---
There's already a perk called Small game
---
Yeah no shit he could have downed them, it was for jokes
---
When will monstrous shrine get a rework already
---
LOL Have you played this game the first 2 years it was out?
---
It only means that absolutely most of the perks are shit = \
---
No u
---
I think theres a bug that if killer dcs, survivors get nothing
---
Can we get this higher up, Im in love with the mori and the mime mocking the survivor. Maybe the mine could hit the survivors knee caps and as the fall he mimics them falling and falls next to the survivor and hits them while they are both on the ground
---
Imagine that she didn't place any traps and a survivor is just crouching to you and you get in the struggle state because of it lol
---
Even BHVR before swf was introduced said they didn't want it because it would unbalance the game. Unfortunately they added without attempting to rebalance it after.. feels bad 😭
---
Every time I see this scene in Scary Movie I always piss my pants.
---
Thank you! :D
---
Wells ladies and gents here is an asshole.
---
My main survivor is Jane because she is p3 and because I think she is really pretty. My main killer is Michael because I'm a huge fan of the Halloween franchise watched all the movies and he is fun to play.
---
Lmao I have a couplue hundred hours intot he game. I run urban evasion. I truly truly truly wish I could just stop playing against hag. Luckily at my rank people dont play hag but when the do I fucking rage so hard
---
I normally only play killer, but as we move into fall I got buddies that start asking to survive with friends. Started at 20, but I like being closer to 10 than 20 because the randos aren't as terrible.
---
Honestly, Wraith or Trapper. At least with Bubba smart players will think “oh man I’ll just do gens”, but with other killers like Wraith/Trapper they magically think they are superman and will proceed to try to unhook you (and die).
---
Stealthy + barely touched a gen or went for saves
---
Let's email them dudes
---
Doing that now
---
- AutohavenMeg, 2019
---
I play SWF a lot cause I have a lot of friends, and my boyfriend, and my mom who all wanna play with me all the time. I just wanna play alone. I always end up doing a shit job with them cause I always throw my life away to keep them off death hooks and it is exhausting watching everyone you know survive, while you died to make it happen. I prefer going into a match where I know no one and getting to decide whether or not I want to help them. Makes the game way easier.
---
I’m with you there, Wraith can be a huge pain when he stealths face camp
---
Where’s momma pig? Can’t have a family without mama.
---
Everyone has that killer that sets them off I think. I guess it just depends which one is the most powerful against your playstyle maybe?
---
No idea
---
Ghostface or Myers 🤔
---
Haha maybe. I play immersive mostly
---
That’s probably why! I play survivor and killer, but my first killer main was Hag. She’s tricky and sneaky, and kind of ruins the immersion of stealthy survivors. I can understand why that would frustrate you. I wish you luck! The worst thing you can do to a Hag is carry a flashlight lol.
---
Lol good luck in the fog
---
Maybe Amanda too. :/
---
r/murderedbymath
---
There are also tons of youtube videos showing killers can 4k sweaty swf teams by playing it right. Stop blaming the game because you don’t know how to lose like a big boy. Is swf a huge advantage over solo? Obviously. Is it unbeatable? No. Most of us get salty, but take it on the chin and try to learn for the next time when we get bullied by sweat squads. Get better, or derank so you can play shit kids all day and win every time so you feel better about yourself.  You quitting and intentionally depipping everyone in the lobby out of spite is shameful, not a group of people trying to play a VIDEOGAME with their friends.
---
Bubba is getting a rework js
---
Now that's a voice that makes me want to eat my own totem.
---
Be gentle? Why would we need too when this is amazing?
---
Nice uses of ded ‘ard
---
New perk Commando Pro !
---
it's not the nurse who needs a rework or change, it's the add-ons and the add-ons only.
---
While I do think that Distortion should be looked at, this would essentially just make the survivor running it immune to aura reading perks for the entire game. It would be way too easy to gain tokens. Maybe make it gain a token every time a generator is completed. That would increase the max number you can have from three to eight, almost double.
---
Yeah, there be some nice killers. I finally got the Outrun Evil trophy thanks to one of them giving me the hatch (and it was the same hatch opened by my team with a key that they all escaped through, so two birds with one stone!).
---
Tough as nails seems... weak.
---
Chances of stacking up to two tokens before vaulting and losing one seems... hard! You can equip resilience and have 9% speed up on repair, sabo, heal, vaulting... Meanwhile you are injured.
---
Anyways, cool concept! I love it. Adventurist its a perk that I could see in the game.
---
At the beginning i only had dailies with Nea.. that's how i became a nea main :^)
---
If you had a Shred of decency you wouldn't have said this.
---
I love getting camped by Huntress for that reason.
---
Bill who notices you: OH MY GOD!!!
---
Ofcourse this bitch has an insta heal. Wouldn’t surprise me if she was in a swf with her rank 16 buddy that ‘is new to the game’
---
Shattered bloodline. You can make some great distraction builds with Adams perks and Spirit one of THE best killers, her perks are also amazing.
---
Ghostface is fun, but his perks aren't that great.
---
Thank you so much 😊
---
Spirit is very strong, but ghostface can be ridiculously fun to play. Keep in mind that ghostface is mid tier killer, so it's somewhat good on red ranks, but you gotta play by survivors mistakes. So in few words:
---
Spirit
---
-Very viable killer
---
-Kind of fun (?), very rewarding
---
-Counters pallets but no windows
---
-Best mindgames and sometimes you get funny reactions from the survivor
---
-Adam is thicc
---
-With prayers Beard is gonna be a very ez game for you as you'll grab people easily. Gives people jumpscares.
---
-Repetitive after a while
---
-No really counterplay, only mindgames
---
-Already too many spirits, nurses and billy.
---
Ghostface
---
-Definitely fun to play
---
-Stealthiest killer in the game
---
-The peek stalk makes you a pervert
---
-One shot potential
---
-Peek a boo
---
-Still gets looped and gotta eat a lot of pallets
---
-Spine chills
---
-No map pressure
---
-Can be revealed easily if they know where you are
---
-At close range very loud
---
All of them bc camping is shitty but if I had to chose I’d say Wraith bc they just stand there and bing bong their stupid bell over and over &amp; also Ghostface bc they usually just teabag you 30x even though you haven’t done anything toxic?
---
Oh and honorable mention: The Doctor bc he’s fucking creepy and they usually stare straight into your soul while they hit you over and over again. At least in my experience.
---
Ghostface in Dead by daylight isn’t from scream, it’s just the same mask
---
Yeah, it gets really annoying.
---
JoJo fans are basically Jehovah's Witnesses, thinking they're doing good when in reality they're fucking annoying.
---
It's amazing keep up the good work!!!
---
Yes, if you're playing solo
---
Isn't it just his add-ons
---
The struggling makes my peepee become the big peepee and then it starts calling the shots
---
I'm calling the emoji police
---
TL:DR Ghostface is a very RNG and difficult killer to play but if you master him he is great however spirit just outweighs him with her positives like great chase pote  plus she comes with Adam has deliverance and diversion(situational but good) good perks(I'd say pick shattered bloodline).    Well Ghostface is kinda difficult to play like really difficult and  RNG with maps could make him good and bad his add-ons are great making him pretty solid however he gets countered hard by spine chill, premonition, and OoO so if a survivor is running that then that is not good for you, his mindgame potential with the stealth is great as it removes the red stain though.    Spirit has fantastic chase potential and her Add-ons make her outstanding plus her perk spirit Fury makes pallets non existence of you have enduring, she comes with Adam which has deliverance which can save you if your teammates don't save fast enough and diversion to attract the killer away maybe from your teammates.
---
Cries in pig traps
---
You do know that I'm talking about the mobile version right?
---
There's no Quentin, a Nightmare on Elms street reboot character in the port.
---
Also, you're entitled to think that everyone has know English perfectly.
---
Now, get off my shoulders you're obnoxious af.
---
it's like old small game if small game's range was 24 meters and only activated after the exits opened
---
Well I'd say sleep as work is more important then games in my opinion but I won't say it's bad if you wanna stay up.
---
That flashlight thing is not a counter because no one holds their blink for 5 seconds. 
---
A really good nurse can completely demolish any survivor out there. If they can predict well enough the chases last 15 seconds and you can't really do anything at all.
---
Same thing happened when the TV came out back in teh day. It all comes full circle.
---
Fucking hate twitch thots. You always see them with their SWF army of white knights too. It's such a pathetic sight.
---
He isnt hungry for 4k's
---
Doctor, for some reason doctors always camp me. No idea why, as soon as I see a doctor I know that I will either get blatantly tunneled or just straight up camped.
---
Yeah that’s true. I always ignore what’s being said just don’t understand it when it come from no where.
---
Hate to be that person but can someone explain the joke to me please I don't get it
---
I had an Object user and their friend call me a tunneller cus I kept finding and hooking them.
---
well...happens...
---
When I get smashed with Head On as a killer I'm not even mad, it's just so goofy
---
And creepy uncle bing bong
---
He’s in the pic already
---
Personally I suggest spine chill over resilience as well, but sprint burst is good so long as you know how to use your sprints effectively and nkt wasting them. Hope would be solid too, but you have adrenaline. No point in having two perks that speed you up and the endgame.
---
you have a decent build imo, go with it
---
I might be wrong because I've never played the game but she looks pretty young. Itll probably need to be one of the adults as they dont allow teens to be in dbd unfortunately
---
BILL YOU HAD THAT THECWHOLE FUCKING TIME
---
Uses perk that lets killer know where you are
---
Killer finds you
---
Shocking
---
No
---
why would you waste time with that?
---
Thanks
---
ShockedPikachu.exe is not responding.
---
 I feel you it’s either ruin is gone in 5 seconds or it’s untouchable thanks to a bugged spot
---
Devs already said teleport exit gates was too powerful. Close the hatch, walk to thr closest gate, teleport to the other. Freddy was originally meant to be an end game killer but he was reworked. He doesn't need buffs.
---
I stayed up. Can't turn off that kind of adrenaline after a long night of playing killer combined with Spotify for in between rounds. This game is absolutely an addiction 😂
---
there’s time to be killed 🤷🏻‍♂️ also facecamping at beginning of match is toxic af
---
Are you honestly saying that killers are too strong?
---
Like unironically?
---
I used object of obsession for this reason. I don't want to be chased, so I pretend I do to be left alone.
---
How about left behind?  At least monstrous shrine helps you even a little, this perk literally does nothing but get you killed.
---
\^Real true comment here.
---
An opimal playing Nurse/Spirit can deal with optimal playing survivors.  
---
All the other killers cant. (Meaning, if the survivors dont fuck, the killer won't win, no matter how good he plays.)
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cnk3d7/do_we_got_everything_in_ptb_just_like_league_of/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
LET REPAIR HER WITH FLEX SEAL!
---
You can buy Adam/Spirit with Iridescent Shards, so I'd get Ghostface first, play and enjoy the game, and then you'll have enough shards to buy a character.
---
Should just get Leatherface.
---
I know Leatherface is pretty bad, but all three of his perks are pretty good and worth having. It'd be a lot faster than just sitting around waiting for BBQ.
---
Wasn’t great? S1 was incredible to me, i see why people don’t like the other seasons though, especially 3 and onward. But I think the start of it was very good at least
---
There are not enough dbd players to support this im afraid
---
I would go absolutely fucking BONKERS if clemmy was in DBD
---
Which three? Are you talking about F13 or just horror movies in general?
---
Because if it's in general, I kinda want to know if I have good taste.
---
Yeah, KO is good too and Franklin's Demise helps against swf
---
Lmao I talking about f13. There's PLENTY of great OG horror movies. But the only good original Fridays imo are 1, 2, 4. The rest scale from garbage to shit but to that's the appeal for alot of people "so bad it's good" kind of shit
---
Well firstly I thank you for actually discussing this with me.
---
I’m at purple ranks and every game ends in a total loss. For all 4 survivors. Everyone slugs so no hatches. I expected people to get better but I still see people crouching around the map edges and all. Doing nothing, 0 loop knowledge and straight unhooking in front of the killer which results in a grab. Only times we manage to win is if the killer’s a total doofus. Maybe that’s why killers seem too strong to me. Because the team isn’t doing it’s job.
---
My point about myers and ghostface is. If a teammate fails to reveal or cut off line of sight. Why am I the one getting instantly exposed? I’ve done nothing wrong.
---
Funny story one time on haddonfield me and a swf were both slugged and this spirit hooks my buddy to kill him all the while I’m crawling towards the hatch that I’d seen earlier in the match
---
Buddy dies, spirit picks me up and starts taking me around to look for the hatch to give me (thank god) 
---
Now I’m a relatively patient guy but she was legit carrying me for upwards of 3 minutes looking all over the complete wrong side of the street so eventually I decide “hey ima just wiggle off her shouldr and point towards where the hatch is”
---
Cue me getting hooked approximately 5 seconds later and dying lmao
---
"it is unclear what the fog's intentions are, but it usually sides with the beast" yeah but not always.
---
Getting bullied as killer is becoming very apparent after hitting rank 11. Survivors seem to all have roughly the same 2 or 3 perks and bully the shit out me. I'm playing kinda smart, but I've only been playing for about a month, and the game is already losing fun **VERY** quickly. Im always getting matched with 3 ppl ranked anywhere from 4-8 and then 1 idiot that's 10+.
---
Thank you. I understand your point of view. 
---
I guess I will have to reach the red ranks and see for myself.
---
Try running haunted grounds and ruin combo. 2/3 games haunted will get cleansed first
---
My dude I've always had the default windows one, could never get it to change. Spent so long thinking it was supposed to be like that.
---
no please, never, it wouldnt work, PC players would have an advantage. devs arent gonna add crossplay just because YOU want to play with your friends. its going to fuck over so many players, imagine mobile and console players going against PC players.
---
Like a xenomorph?
---
Love u too
---
I like this
---
Honestly rank doesn’t matter. All about the blood points imo. rank points are broken anyways, since potatoes can pip easily.
---
No not equally as op, it will obviously be slightly less reliable than it used to be. But it is still going to be op in that form.
---
Thank you
---
Never go alone gonna have to be exhuastion perk otherwise it be too broken ,but overall its seems like a cool character idea
---
Iron Will and Sloppy Butcher
---
The problem I think is that so many killers are straight up m1
---
it needs a buff tbh, the cooldown is too long just for 3 seconds, the either need to make the perk leave no scratch marks for longer or make the cooldown shorter
---
goes to school, gets bullied. plays dbd, gets bullied. yeah idk.
---
He's probably the 5th best killer rn he doesnt need a buff
---
Red ranks are just horrible as killers.  
---
Lots of SWF groups. (Atleast on PC).  
---
Every second game atleast 1-3 insta heals involved.  
---
Atleast 1 guy every game will t-bag you.  
---
I understand 100% of the salt from every killer main here.  
---
Red ranks made me stop playing this game a week ago.  
---
SWF with insta heals, into SWF with insta heals, into SWF with insta heals.  
---
I played 7 games. 6 games were like that.  
---
And that's not rare.  
---
You have to tryhard with Top Tier killers to stand a chance against those.  
---
Coordinated playing SWF groups just break the balance of this game on these higher ranks.  
---
Then I go to this subreddit and people (survivor mains) say it's fine.
---
Then I queue up another game. Endgame. I hook 1 guy, he gets instantly saved. Hook another. He gets instantly saved.  
---
Ends up that I hooked all 4, but all 4 are free again.  
---
I down every one of them in front of the opened gates.  
---
I cant slug them. They would just crawl out.  
---
So I pick the first one up. DS. He escapes.  
---
I pick the second one up. DS. He escapes.  
---
Third one, same.  
---
Fourth one, same.  
---
Nothing I could do. That perk is just ridicolously overpowered if used by strong survivors or even by weak survivors in the right scenarios.  
---
Then I go to this subreddit and people are like: dS iS fInE. jUsT dOnT tUnNeL.
---
Dont believe what people are saying here, on this subreddit. I came to the conclusion, long ago, that people here are incredible biased towards the survivors site.
---
Say NOED is broken, and you'll jet 1000 upvotes.  
---
Mention that SWF breaks the balance and people will downvote you into oblivion.  
---
Well, that's just my little rant.  
---
Have a nice day :)
---
Dat lag switch .-. Some pc players are disgusting &amp; feel good about this
---
You get points for the generators being repaired while you’re in a chase
---
Rank 20 trapper
---
Bubba's chest. 
---
Stuff inside, Bubba's!
---
You takes 
---
Bubba's chest stuff, Bubba 
---
takes 
---
your face.
---
Lag switch. The killer just has to fiddle around with their connection in order to capture the players. Lag switch TO MUCH and the match gets dc’d! It’s happened a lot on twitch streams and to me in fact. YT it, smh, it’s sad
---
Matchmaking :/ awww man that stinks! My friend was a rank 20 trapper and got ‘gg’ ‘uninstall’ and ‘ez clap gg’ from green and purple ranks. He was shocked that they could be mean on his first try as trapper
---
Pro gamer move
---
Exactly
---
&gt;Unrelenting the only perk on page 2
---
Go with **Agitation** for your 3rd perk then. Is not good but it should save you some time when carrying a survivor to a hook. 
---
4th perk you can go with **Franklin's** just to piss survivors off or even **Save The Best For Last** just for the sake of equipping something.
---
😆
---
Sabo squads died  out basically, dlcs that are worth it are spirits/ shattered bloodlines. Colorblind setting haven't been added I think and for meta perks it's BBQ,Ruin,enduring and Spirit fury(spirit perk that destroys pallets Everytime you break 2) and adrenaline,DS, dead hard, BT or WGLF
---
I thought fire up was pretty good though?
---
Masturbate.
---
How did you get there?!?
---
FINNALY A FELLOW CLAUDDETE MAIN but listen... i gen rush with her i dont hide... but i get flamed by so many fucking killers IN LOBBY for being clauddete... i just like her 80s windbreaker... =(
---
1. Yes and no most people sabotage a hook to 99% then if the killer takes someone to that hook you sabo it infront of him 
---
2. Laurie for decisive strike, Feng is someone a lot of people like for Lithe, I personally like Adam for Autodidact it can kill or help save games 
---
3. No
---
4. Just YouTube perk tier list survivor there are pretty good ones out there :)
---
Additional  the sequel cult of chucky actually would help explain his power due to the fact he can control one or more dolls and actual people so he could hook people using this possession.
---
&gt;I thought fire up was pretty good though?
---
I dislike perks that only activates when you lose Generators but if you think so, use it.
---
Chucky is way too short imagine how it would look when he grabbed a survivor on his shoulder, he would be even shorter than hag and she might be bare minimum
---
Yes, your tokens obtaining occasion sounds viable as well. Now, we have two potential versions of reworking this perk. But, maybe after the last gen all tokens would be lost? Cuz it will be OP, imo. I'd like to give an opportunity to the killers, who running "Bitter Murmur", see your aura, as it's intended in this perk. Or, however, let the "Bitter Murmur" obscure blocking all aura reading abilities.
---
Seems so..
---
1- the new strat is to sabo to 99% and when the killer is near break it
---
*equips Object of Obsession so the Killer ignores me*
---
*game starts*
---
*blink sounds*

crying_cat.jpeg
---
This... does put a smile on my face
---
Just take a break, play some Civ or something
---
thanks, ill keep that in mind next time
---
The devs never ruled out short killers. Only non humanoids. Plus while he would require a new carry animation there's no shortage of things they could do with it. Maybe he simply just drags and throws their asses up there or they could say that the Entity strengthened his voodoo powers and he can just telepathicly lift them up
---
Re-designin the game would be optimal.  
---
But that's complicated.
---
I am not a dev. I don't know their resources.
---
But I'll try it.
---
If we are talking about buffs/nerfs/changes:
---
  
---
14 out of 16 killers are underpowered.
---
1 killer is balanced. (Spirit) - slightly overpowered with prayer beads.  
---
1 killer is slightly overpowered. (Nurse) - or heavily overpowered with the right addons (Omega-Blink).
---
Survivors are the power role in this game. This is just a fact.  
---
If the game starts with 2 survivors running towards you to t-bag you, and they still end up winning, something might be wrong.
---
\- Just out of the top of my hat I would try to make every pallet mindgame'able.  
---
Pallets that break line of sight, so it's up to a mindgame who wins the pallet game.  
---
Atleast 80% of pallets are still simple run-arrounds where killers are just forced to chase you in a simple stupid manner.
---
It's stupid. It wastes time. There is no skill involved. And I dont know if anyone is having fun playing a circle-running simulator.
---
\- Buff Hag and Wraith by not making flashlights completely nullify their power.
---
\-Improve/Add something to skill checks on gens. Maybe have the needle turn sometimes to the left aswell. Just having the same skill checks over and over is boring.

\-Nerf Omega-Blink addons. Redesign/buff other addons. There are still killers out there with addons that are just NOT viable or would weaken you.
---
\- Fix hex totem spawns. 4 out of 5 games my ruin still spawns completely visable next to a gen, or even next to a survivor spawn. And I've got a filled up to date screenshot folder to prove this.  
---
We could even go a step further and make it so that hex totems just look like dull totems, which could lead into survivors cleansing more totems. More BP for them. Less NOED to care about.  
---
And maybe your hex lives longer than 20 seconds in red ranks.  
---
\- Redesign SWF. I don't know how. SWF is a part of DbD. Don't remove it. But do something about it. It breaks the balance.
---
Atleast apply a bandage fix so that killers get rewarded if their odds stack against them.  
---
Something like ... Killer faces:  
---
2 SWF + 1 Random + 1 Random = 25% more BP at the end of the game (for the killer).  
---
2 SWF + 2 SWF = 50% more BP.  
---
3 SWF + 1 Random = 75% more BP.  
---
4 SWF = 100% more BP.  
---
This would compensate facing players sitting in coms with the own purpose to ruin your/my day until bhrv figures something out.  
---
\- Harsher punishes for DC's.  
---
\- Harsher punishes for verbal abuse.  
---
\- Dedicated servers. (They are working on it).
---
\- Give survivors more BP.  
---
\- Nerf DS. Rework NOED. Rework hex' in general.
---
\- Buff LF's chainsaw tracking. His bumping into stuff mechanic seems pretty random and inconvinient.
---
\- Nerf red moris.
---
\- Nerf insta-heals and keys.
---
\- Redesign the game arround ranks. Something like: It takes longer to complete gens on red and purp ranks, while yellow till green is basically the same easy mode we got currently. And brown ranks are maybe even easier? I dont know. You get the idea.
---
You could even apply this to SWF.
---
\- Add variety to survivors. Bill is like Dwight. Dwight is like Claudette. Claudette is like Nea. They only differ in appearence. I play Claudette for her camouflage. Some play Ace for his "buildin iron will".
---
But besides that, all of them are the same.
---
Maybe add a little, not game-changing unique passive to every survivor.
---
Even if it's something petty like: Claudette heals 5,6,7% (Depending on Prestige, so it actually does something) faster.
---
Meg's exhaustion recovers 6,8,10% quicker or something like that.
---
\- Add something to prestiges or hitting rank 1. Cosmetics. Emotes. I don't know. Something would be nice.
---
\- Rework the Bloodnet. This game requires WAY TOO MUCH grinding to get all perks on the killers and survivors you want. DbD is more of a casual party game. Making it that you have to farm hundreds of millions of BP isn't that nice.
---
Those are just some changes I could spontaneously think off.
---
If it would be up to me, I would redesign the game even further and force survivors into an ego perspective (Like the killers PoV).   
---
But give them a button to look behind their shoulder. (Doable while working on gens).  
---
This could add some "horror" to this supposedly horror game.

I don’t think there are a lot of people who knows that you can crouch to avoid setting off hag traps. Shit, I’m rank 4 on PS4 and 7 on pc and I didn’t even know this.
---
In my opinion, a very thoughtful concept of the character, I played in all parts and it matches dbd. And as for the last skill a very good idea for noed. In the case of clem skybound there will no longer be a further series with this character or story, so the character will no longer used and will go into oblivion so it would be in dbd :). Creators think about it: D
---
i am a rank 1 survivor and i think noed should be nerfed
---
or, TOTH?
---
1) Sabo is bad. Just don't. Rip Jake.
---
2)Adam is thicc, and if you get the whole thing you get also one of the killer, the spirit.
---
3)Nope
---
4)Pain reliever has perk tier list for both survivor and killer. Don't worry the meta is still gen rush, self care, DH or SB, Adrenaline and decisive.
---
Man lee or clementine would make me extremelyyyy happy
---
nah, I usually take the free down
---
freddy is perfectly balanced atm, he doesn’t need changes
---
ah sorry.  I just need more friends near my rank, and he seems like he could use a friend.
---
Lullaby, STLFTB, Shadowborn and whispers
---
I hate tp's and dcers (toxic players and disconnecters)
---
Wow dude! Looks awesome
---
from playing Bubba 95% of the time cuz my only one with max BBQchili, these would make him feel better: 
---
if you're gonna have a slow on chainsaw charge, why not just give him a very small movespeed boost on charge release to compliment bloodlust.   
---
Also speaking of the release, the 99.99% shit has made me miss so many fucking downs, even with add-ons for shorter time this shit happens (but not as bad).  
---
and please for the love of god, let us cancel chainsaw after release as well, I don't mind if I cancel and then swing once or twice, it's the 5 extra swings while the survivor stares from the floor that makes me mad. time plays a big part and Bubba wastes so much time for himself.
---
Played a game once as Pig, ended up completely slaughtering the entire team. The Dwight was the only one left. I found him crouched cowering in a corner, I downed him and carried him to hatch. His teammates were all in purple ranks and he was rank 20. They thanked me for letting him go because he's new and they were trying to show him the ropes of DBD. ;-;
---
..there's an achievement at the end of the tunnel? Surely, that's reward enough! Plus the bragging rights.
---
Last one should be in form of "Alt+F4" lul
---
First rule of survival is Watch your step.
---
It's harder and harder to be a kind killer these days with all the teabagging etc.
---
I main Nurse tho?
---
Yeah it's kinda rare but in red ranks sometimes it happens.
---
Just run both flip-flop and DS
---
THANK YOU! I have 30 hours in the game and im at rank 10. It took me 5 games to get that just repairing the gen will take more time with ruin but is still fast enough to not waste 5 minutes crouching around the map. JUST DO THE GEN IF YOU FAIL A SKILL CHECK ITS NOT THAT BAD.
---
I mean sure getting the achievement is nice but its a 1 time thing and i would much rather play fun games then hard sweaty games if there is no point in being at a higher rank
---
Ya. Survivors whine. It’s just part of DBD. Wait until you start getting good at killer. Noobs love to blame the killer for their own badness. You’ll really start to see how much weight the insult “camper” or “tunneler” carries.
---
use 9000 shards it takes about 2 weeks to get that if your a filthy casual and less than a week if you grind
---
Shard cheddar or GTFO.
---
bruh its a super outdated meme why you putting your name on it lmao
---
Happens to my Kate all the time.
---
I think for the Resident Evil chapter it would be better to have Marvin as the survivor. Or maybe a member of S.T.A.R.S, cause Leon is kinda still alive.
---
It's Lithe.
---
Yeah I see a lot of people saying that a good killer cops it the worst. I’m a pretty terrible killer so I don’t get it too bad. It’s like you do well as killer, survivors are mad. You don’t do well, survivors still mad about something.
---
Boil over on The Game has gotten me once or twice just cuz I couldn't walk through the damn doors lol but still trash yes
---
Small game doesn't reveal auras, and this does. At the drawback of only being able to use it as the gates are powered.
---
Nice try, BHVR.
---
I’m sure I’ll pick it up soon! If I’m being entirely honest I stopped playing the game around when stardew valley came out since uh all of my time went to that. But I’m excited to be coming back!
---
Tough as nails might be fun but Adventurous would be a dope perk to have!!! It would shit on those pesky NOED games where your random solo teammates gen rushed I didn’t have time to cleanse all totems!
---
There's also a perk called detective's hunch
---
I"M GETTING FUCKING MORID BY 5 DIFFERENT STREAMERS LIKE ENTITYLEFTHAND WHO I DSED LIKE A WHOLE FUCKING YEAR AGO BUT HE STILL CANT GET OVER IT BECAUSE HES A FUCKING ASSHOLE I RUN THIS NOOB AROUND FOR 2 MINUTES AND NO FUCKING GENS GET DONE BY MY RANK 8 TEAMMATES EVEN THOUGH IM RANK 4 AND SO IS THAT CUNTSTREAMER. ITS ALWAYS THE BIGGEST FUCKING NOLIFERS WITH 5000+ HOURS USING THE BIGGEST CRUTCHES TO BEAT ME BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THEY WOULD SUCK BALLS. FUCK BHVR FOR GIVING THESE FUCKING REJECTS AN INSTANT-WIN OFFERING AND BEING ABLE TO CHECK PROFILES AND USE IT AS A TARGETED HARASSMENT TOOL. FUCK THIS CANCEROUS GAME UNTILL BHVR NERF KILLERS BROKEN SHIT IM OUT
---
Killer dislocated her hand, nice pixel art tho.
---
What a fucking pussy!!!! This pos streamer is nothing but another DC cock stain with the rest of them streaming assholes. BhVR should ban him for that!

Honestly I would grab any survivor ritual by the throat and run with it.
---
Flip flop tho
---
She is free on PS4, ... as long as you have ps plus
---
Aw shit I got found out guess I better pack my bags and ditch this place. /s
---
When I play survivor, I either find it while I'm being chased or I don't ever find it.
---
sigh ***unzips***
---
As a myers main, this hurts.
---
This but should be a feature
---
I open DBD, think about playing survivor, remember that I'm gonna get at least 2-3x the blood points running a killer with BBQ, then play killer because I want to level my survivors faster. 
---
Im basically a killer main that dreams of one day switching sides.. maybe one day...
---
TBH I am a survivor main and the only time that I get salty is when the killer facecamps and/or tunnels me the entire time... Lower rank I get it but when you get higher in ranks survivor mains don't want to see that. Otherwise all the survivor rules for killer I dont understand why they've been "made". Sadly the games state has made me stop playing for a while so I haven't been able to get much of an update on the status of dead by daylight from my own eyes
---
I chase survivors on my own terms,  or when they want me to chase them.
---
they said that some maps are better fps, so they are doing it
---
Ash was still alive, same with Laurie
---
Obviosly he need more than that, this is dead by fashion
---
It's not worthless though. It provides a very powerful effect though in a limited range and during a specific timed event within the match. It's situational but that doesn't make it worthless, especially since it literally provides an aura/wall hack within that range.
---
You would still have to search but being able to just run by a wall or small series of walls or even a building to see traps for a last second save or a totem that may be NOED is strong. especially if you don't have to go into a building or through a walled area. It would be a valuable perk for more 'aggressive' survivors that don't just zip out the doors. Or would encourage less prone players to maybe look around to see if they can find a NOED and go in for a last second save with team mates.
---
Honestly, out of all the fan made perks I've seen lately these three are probably the most well thought out and most balanced. They all  potentially provide strong effects but have a token limit, time limit, or a specific time frame in which they can be used.
---
This is the most toxic game there is right?
---
Top tier killer with great perks, mid tier killer with bad perks.
---
It’s actually pretty OP imo. If you’re looping a jungle gym, or the shack, you’ll only medium vault because you’ll be hugging the wall. In order to get a fast vault you’d have to run in a straight line with a certain distance (which isn’t happening if you’re looping a jungle gym or the shack). It’d turn a 0.9 second medium vault to a 0.63, which is only 0.13 off from being the same speed as a fast vault. As long as you never fast fault you’ll be a lot harder to catch at jungle gyms, the shack, and a bunch of OP infinites (like ironworks).
---
but clown isnt stealth based
---
Exactly can't have enough fashion(I literally mess with my survivor and killer cosmetics to find new setups)
---
Are they actually grey? Or am I colour blind lol?
---
They can and do. My friend got banned for a week for deranking by just pressing leave match over and over. Obviously that is a bit more extreme than the occasional DC, but they clearly can track it and will penalize abuse of the system.
---
That was a great play but poor Michael was like 7 feet away from that locker door lol.
---
It’s gonna happen, though I don’t want it to, they’ll reduce pallets from 10-5 or something, they’ll ruin him somehow.
---
It's funny because no one asked for your opinion on it. And the guy you responded to said it was a good thing.
---
She'd be so small though, everyone would pick her

i would love a shaun of the dead paragraph

Don’t teach your kids about sex! If you teach them about sex they’ll never get pregnant as teenagers!

Ok, AidsJohnsn isn't.

PS4 MY GOOD MAN WHERE MORE PEOPLE PLAY SURVIVOR THAN KILLER BECAUSE THE FPS ARE SHIT ON CONSOLE BECAUSE BHVR KEEPS FALLING SHORT ON GETTING MORE CONSOLE OPTIMIZATION! YOU GUYS IN THE PC WORLD HAVE IT MADE!

Please please please make icons!

That DC was the cherry on top of it

what the heck is mind channel

It hurts every damn time :(

I can assure you this is drawn by a 9 year old, I have no artistic or creative talent whatsoever.
---
ASSFACE?

THEN..... JACKASS. UUH. I MEAN JAKEFACE. WHAT.
---
Thank god lol
---
nice
---
No I have never played killer before! I’m on PS4 and play killer all the time, P3 Myers main and nurse main and yes I ran into it allot and it wasn’t the end of the world! I had a hole team of ash’s running it, then as the game went on weeks later I would have other survivor skins running it and normally 2-3 would have it, but you know what, it wasn’t the end of the world and I would still get them because MoM would be used up in the beginning of the match because I would be hitting them all and no just chasing one guy!
---
OMG how did things go so wrong lmao :’)
---
Reminds me of Friday the 13th where Jason beats a guy to death using his friend tied up in a sleeping bag :’P
---
Ahahahaha yes Iron will  
---
NO GRUNTING!
---
MY FIRST GAME YESTERDAY WAS AGAINST A VERY LAGGY FREDDY, I WENT TO GO UNHOOK THE JAKE AND THEN HE TRIES TO WAKE ME UP. I GET ANIMATION LOCKED SO I CAN'T MOVE AT ALL. ALL MY TEAMMATES DIE AND I MESSAGE THE KILLER TO PLEASE COME KILL ME.
---
SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING, SHE DOWNS ME AND TRIES TO PICK ME UP BUT THE GAME ISN'T GIVING HER THE PROMPT. SHE EVEN CLOSES THE HATCH AND MY ADRENALINE DOESN'T PICK ME UP. I HAD TO DC SO I WASN'T HOLDING THE GAME HOSTAGE CAUSE I KNEW I WOULDN'T DIE TO THE EGC.
---
ON THE PLUS SIDE THE FREDDY WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY NICE 9 YEAR OLD, SHE DID A SWF WITH ME BECAUSE SHE FELT BAD ABOUT ME GETTING CUCKED THAT GAME. I AM EMBARASSED TO SAY THAT A 9 YEAR OLD IS A HIGHER RANK THAN ME.
---
Dunno about an App, but there's a website that gives you random perks. It's actually a lot of fun when you're playing KYF. 
---
However, if you mean a build maker as in choosing different settings and it giving you a build according to that... I don't know anything
---
I have no issue with her drawing 2 women kissing. I think it's cool that she hasn't gone for a stereotypical coupling.
---
*Doubt*
---
I bet he already stalked you til 99% and then just waited to see how long you'll need to realize he's there. Thats what i like to do as Ghostface
---
It's a great perk when combined with Lithe but on its own it really sucks.
---
"this will be your alternate identity. do not remove the mask."
---
i asked them this back in april, they appreciated the sugestion and said they would forward it to the team
---
Swap DS for Small Game and we're talking
---
Blendettes are more annoying than “toxic” survivors imo. At least the “toxic” survivors give you something to do. I feel like I’m gonna lose my mind looking around the whole map and not finding anyone.
---
Well, the first one is gonna be about Claudette so you're gonna have to wait.
---
I cringed everytime you camped at a pallet
---
Imagine thinking Adrenaline is as much of a crutch as Noed
---
No fucking way
---
Yes, it started happening to me after one of the updates in July. I’ll get randomly kicked on menu, in lobbies, and in games. Not all the time but much more often than before. I’m pretty sure it’s a game issue.
---
Her leg! How the ever gonna walk again!?
---
level adam, deliverance is also good
---
Chances are if it’s their first game they’re gonna die on the hook for trying to Kobe
---
Banning toxic players would pretty much be getting rid of the entire player base lmao. You cant ban people for bein a dick head unless they cheated in some way
---
If you weren't plag, you would have pipped
---
Practice practice practice;)
---
Haha funny meme. I get the joke, 69 like sex
---
Ok be honest, how long did this take you to set up.
---
Ah ok thx
---
You realise kid's shows cam feature people kissing?
---
Or is this just a homophobia things?
---
People who have it setup where you can’t message them on PS4 are either a Child in which Mommy is protecting her precise toxic child or they are a repeat offender on camping or tunneling and other toxic BhVR. They don’t wanna hear the complaints from people. I’ve run into the same killers multiple times on PS4 and the ones who camp asshole to asshole or tunnel keep on doing it and that’s why they have messaging set to private. Bad thing is camping has been bad on PS4 especially in the lower ranks and when rank reset comes around it doesn’t matter what rank it is, everyone camps! But most of the campers will hook whoever they get first and literally just sit there ready to down the next guy or snatch them off and are ruining that hooked players gaming experience and is grounds for griefing to be a reported and bannable offense but BhVR keeps saying it’s okay and not a ban-able offense but the other is if another player is ruining my experience
---
MK mobile got a Classic Freddy skin so it's possible but up to the devs to ask
---
Still yet to meet a Killer in-game that complains about Adrenaline.
---
They said they wouldn't unban you. Hence why they said DO AT YOUR OWN RISK. EAC nor the devs will unban you for this. I been using modded icons for a while and haven't gotten banned but please do this at your own risk.
---
The only perk Myers should have as survivor is unbreakable. This checks out.
---
The entire player base is toxic. Good luck lol
---
Just cause people dont like anime dont mean they sad man, everyone got their preferences.
---
I meant it’s sad that they feel the need to shit on people who like it.
---
Hey I just got my chilli 30 lvls in
---
I'm surprised that a 9 year old knows about "X" in "Nea X Meg" symbolizing made up fan fiction relationships
---
Someone already asked me this before and I said no because it’s too time consuming!
---
Also, Bug:
---
Place a bug on the killers pillow, after the match the killer explodes out of fear from the bug and grants all survivors 2x bloodpoints.
---
I doubt a 3rd grader drew this
---
Sounds like I need to give them a watch.
---
Yeah I have had it happen on PS4. It acts like a killer DC and I get rewarded survival points like it but when I get to the main screen I get no points.
---
He probably just dropped him on hatch and the kid just wanted to be toxic for no reason
---
Should the extremely unlikely thing happen and we do get banned for usage, have the devs said that they'd lift bans for something like icon edits? I'm very risk-averse with trying something like this if even the smallest chance might mean all my progress and purchases are locked out and I'm just SOL.
---
This drawing makes her look cute but in game it's just a big no no, if I had to pick hottest killer it would probably be huntress or a husbando would   
---
obvisouly be Michael myers
---
I do this too, but if they struggle i drop them and move my camera back and forth to tell them no, then pick em up again. About 95% of them get the message
---
Okay salty survivor
---
"tunneling toxic" yeah sure buddy you'd watch some asshole play the game but you won't tunnel people, very believeable.
---
She drew it on flipaclip on her ipad. I have no interests in votes or karma or whatever, I've never posted before and doubt I will again. I'm proud of what she did here and of all the other amazing stuff she's drawn and she asked me to share it. That's all.
---
I thought the last one was pretty good. I'd wanted Poised for gen-jockeying and I track using sound a lot so Stridor is good to have available. Two perks in one shrine is a win to me.
---
It did? Can you link how it looks like in game?
---
[deleted]
---
She's interested in fan fiction, has read stories and looked at pictures. Is that surprising?
---
It sucks being a Hag main and then switch to survivor for a daily, only to see the other three survivors with you violate every rule of going against the Hag when you inevitably go against one. It makes me angry that I can't get those survivors as her, but I'm sat crying on a hook because some fucker sprinted past me as I'm cleansing Ruin
---
But not totally impossible, or else she wouldn't of achieved this.
---
Yes all survivor mains.
---
It's not any different from something like Borrowed Time or DS though. You can't always just "not facecamp" or "not tunnel" to avoid them. There will be legitimate times where they are just unhook in you TR despite you not bring there (double calm Doc comes to mind) or you legitimate just ran into them again in &lt;60 seconds.
---
The perk should be plausible to get off, unless you just want the complete deletion or rework of the perk. The only thing I can personally think of is make it a reverse BT with steeper activation and a shorter timer for unhookers.
---
probably its the first characters, meg claud, dwight and jake, and trapper, billy and wraith...
---
Every time I see a 4 man adrenaline, I lose 2 years of life expectancy
---
I feel. so stupid right now.

Survivors Rules for Killers #1849
---
"The killer may not use moris, even though they are apart of the game." 
---
Subsection B: "The use of 'Insta Heal being Toxic' defense is hereby null and void. Due inpart that Survivors outnumber the killer in votes"
---
I now want a killer who wears Black Plate armor.
---
Thank :)
---
Imagine losing to legion in the current year
---
This is the best thing I've ever read
---
thank you so much for telling me this
---
I'm sobbing now thinking of all the times I've ran over at top speed to unhook someone
---
Right because I totally defended instaheals, seriously people like you need to get punched in the fucking face.
---
If cringe had an audio sample, it would be her voice yelling "P R A Y E R B E A D S".
---
yea i think ur actually brain damaged
---
It is frowned upon to use any addons that aren't brown. Check your "rulebook for survivor fun" for more details.
---
If they ever add Jason, there'd be a shitton of new skins.
---
I love getting baby Dwights. There’s something wholesome about chasing them around and picking on them before letting them go
---
Imma let you live, but I’m gonna torment you a little beforehand, you know?
---
🎶Baby Dwight doo doo doo doo doo doo🎶
---
I think its the icon but I was like why the fuck would i wanna stick something in my pp hole
---
Season 1 is up there with my favorite games of all time.
---
When it first came out, it was a vastly different type of game too. Trying to explain the game to friends who thought it was a shooter was tough. But rather than saying "No, you sort of just walk around and interact with things...", I just told them to play it and find out and we all loved it.
---
I'M NOT AFFECTED BY JUMPSCARES IN MOVIES BUT FOR SOME REASON HAG'S TRAPS GIVE ME SO MUCH FUCKING ANXIETY AND NOBODY ELSE REALIZES YOU CAN JUST CROUCH AROUND HER TRAPS SO THEY END UP TRIGGERING THE 6 FUCKING TRAPS SHE HAS AROUND THE HOOK I'M ON
---
Its shows you the killer aura, like using object of obsession without revealing your aura to killer and without any range limit.
---
Oh shit we have a moron over here better watch this guy he.... He bucks pretty hard
---
EbOny MoRi ToXiC ReEEeE
---
I loved every season except for 3. I kind of hated it to be exact.
---
I assume it's a bug with the exit gate, since he's at the level where the exit gate is.
---
Many Dwights are toxic POS too. I'll kill them all before killing the others.
---
The next thing that bugs me are the guys who think they're hot shit for juking a newbie killer when they have thousands of hours on the game... I had this happen to me, then I killed him on the next match and he cried about lag lmao
---
Well you got "we have a moron over here"-part right.
---
♿ ♿ ♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿
---
Longer cooldown, yes. That is fair. Fundamentally making her easy to see? No, and fuck you for wanting that. That would be like having an addon on Ghostface that let's him expose you faster but he's knocked out of his power by being near you. Instead of being spotted.
---
Don’t you have to wait all game to use noed?
---
Adrenaline rewards you for doing your objective  
---
NOED rewards you for failing your objective
---
Plague gets awful emblems. Surviors control her power and chaser emblem. If they don't cleanse you get silver at most, because you one shot everyone. Also, because they don't waste time on healing they just do gens, which makes getting a good Gatekeeper hard(the massacre usually starts when only one gen is left).
---
The chaser emblem is the same with Billy/LF if you chainsaw everyone the whole match. Have fun!
---
I SHOULDN'T BE HIT THROUGH A COMPLETE VAULT
---
Doesnt it last forever until you find the totem?
---
How would you determine which one you came out of. Would it be a case of you exit out the one you came in or if you run up the right side you go to the shack, left to the other entrance? Also how would this work on the Game map where the basement is a fixed location?
---
Thats why wraith and legion are so bad. Poor guys get screwed by adreneline
---
Doesn’t Adrenaline ignore the exhaustion affect?
---
My only problem with adren is that people who are on a hook long before last gen activates get free instaheal and speed boost. Other than that it’s really just a minor annoyance nothing else.
---
Its not about gender here, it's about a nine year old knowing what it looks like moments before to adults go down on eachother..
---
Ah i see what you're saying 
---
I mainly play as a survivor so I guess i've stopped caring as much about matches i lose because of the other survivors. I just bring a key most games and if it happens i just wait for the killer to close the hatch if i cant find it.
---
Meh thats nothing, I encountered a Huntress last night that straight up face camps with iridescent head specifically just to piss people off. I'll take a mori over that any day. I did manage to get the gens done and escape but after the game was over they told us to check out their page and it was literally months of steam profile comments about how they face camped. 
---
I think people play this game until they mentally break or something.
---
Not an app but I use this page off my iPhone a lot. https://dpsm.3stadt.com/survivor?sids=&amp;kids=

Im a winner
---
Here's your well deserved downvote, I chuckled :D
---
Honestly I'd be happier with it if it just gave like double bloodpoints for sacrifices. Its suuuuch a bad perk right now.
---
Remove hook and luck keep map and mist
---
Jason just would be a trapper reskin
---

Ha ha I highly doubt she made that connection. We did spend the day at gay pride last weekend and she did watch grace jones perform on stage so perhaps she drew some inspo from her surroundings.
---
This is just one out of many people with over 5000 hours who do this shit, this game caters to losers who want easy wins, I can imagine someone who would also enjoy cheating in other games enjoy this game for how you can basically cheat by just using the most broken addons and offerings, I think thats how this game attracts mentally broken people.
---
Okay genuinely where was killer supposed to go at the start of the clip?
---
"tlak'
---
Am I just misunderstanding something, or is Legion power bugged/it's description is written poorly?
---
"When activating Feral Frenzy, The Legion enters a deadly rage. **While the power is active: Survivors' Scratch Marks and Blood Pools are hidden from The Legion's view.**"
---
From that I'd understand that he simply can't see them while in Feral Frenzy.
---
But it seems like instead, they just aren't made during it, so if survivor was running away from you and your Frenzy ran out, you won't see the scratch marks they left. So for example you may run up to gen with Frenzy, surv was on it and ran away, you end it, and you don't see the scratch marks that would show where surv ran off to.
---
You tryna bring back scarrs of the great Ace and Dwight war of 2017?
---
Nice. The opposite of the dude that pointed the locker he saw me entering to the killer yesterday.
---
Boi
---
Happened to me earlier today. Dude stood in the middle of the pallet teabagging so I couldn't run through it. Died on first hook.
---
As others said, most of the playerbase would be banned if they would be banning for simple insults. Sadly this is how the game has been since release, for some reason it attracts toxic losers with nothing else to do. Altough the amount of toxicity has increased a lot with game's popularity.
---
I usually don't even use report button just to report some moron who teabagged me and trashtalked in post game chat. With that being said, if some kiddo survivor tells me to die irl and that he's going kill my whole family, even though I know he would do shit, I report these losers. As ex Dota 2 player I'm used to toxicity trust me, but there has to be line "omg lol u suck idiot gg ez", teabagging and so on and "I'm gonna kill your family" or racist insults.
---
You can drop items...that's sharing them...
---
No need to have the ability to trade items between games IMO
---
Truth
---
Yeah. I was getting bored of his tyraid. I literally put my opinion on one of his posts and this happened
---
Me, and intellectual: The devs are too op plz nerf!
---
That reminds me of this guy who accused me of farming just because I had wglf equipped. The only reason I have it is because it gives a boost in case I have a bad match. Sometimes it’s worthless when I don’t get the saves but if I can add the extra bit it’s nice. But I had a survivor send me an angry message accusing me of farming just cause of that perk. Also called me a kid despite the fact I’m probably twice his age, lol. Pretty sad I get more butt hurt messages from my “teammate” survivors than I do the killers. I don’t do anything to killers that I know to make them mad. But have gotten a couple from killers, but survivors are sadly the ones sending me angry messages the most for dumb reasons. Like once a guy gave me crap for not trying to save him when he was being basement camped by leatherface. I knew he was because the person had kindred on, I didn’t have borrowed time so it was a suicide mission. In my place I’m fine with it cause people can get gens done. I don’t know, some people are just confrontational.
---
Wait for events they have skins
---
Well indeed the power is pretty simple because I thought of some add-ons powers actually, like one that would give you the ability to trap directly coridors or things like that, in order to prevent loops. I also thought of adding a hindered status effect straight away but as I didn't know if the 9% slow was too much, I didn't add it. Though if others slow by 15% I'll change that to make a base slow of 15%!
---
Yeah about Stay with me I thought of it as a perk to slow the game while being a choice to make between this and NOED. Didn't know if the action speed debuff was much so I didn't dare make the way I thought at first: 2 / 3 / 3% for each level and then the debuff when last token is gone would be -15% for 120 seconds. It would be as a hex without really being one. In fact I first thought of it as a hex that would reduce action speed by 10% while up, and at the same time it would disguise all dull totems as hex totems. Every time a disguised totem would be cleansed, the action speed debuff would go down of 10 more percent for 90 seconds.
---
But honestly I'm not quite sure bodyblocking traps would be THAT cool. For the killer they would be interesting but what about survivors... If a power doesn't require any skill from the killer's part and can give him a hit / down without any need to learn how to correctly use the power, I think it's not that much of a nice power...
---
Sure but they still have their own purpose in this game . Hillbilly for good players and leatherface for skillless basement bois .
---
Martyrdom (to keep with the video game references)
---
As a player who plays both killer and survivor, yeah please shut the fuck up
---
Well I mean raise your kid how you want I guess but typically exposing your child to very mature content like that has consequences down the road. At the very least you need to make sure she understands what this is all about. That picture she drew isnt a normal kiss or a first kiss that's too people about to fuck eachother that your nine year old drew.
---
Where did bill get a grenade?
---
All I want is Asylum Jumpsuit Myers.
---
I'd really want to see that outcry if they brought the old Mori back. Also thanks for the tip, I'll give him follow.
---
No what I don’t like is that every asshole on PS4 will camp game after game after game, when you are not able to do anything but play a hook simulator game and make no points or progress and are also wasting offerings or items. That’s what I’m getting at, but fine you bastards who camp can continue to keep new players from joining the game with your bs play style and I’ve tried getting people to play but this happens to them and they move onto something else...
---
That’s a yikes from me dawg
---
oh no this cosmetic, a thing which doesn’t enhance gameplay and makes me look different, angers me because it costs money, oh woe is me.
---
i would love a killer that gets better unlocking powers by survivors passing throw traps
---
Literally nobody believes your shit lmao. 
---
Why is a 9 year old even aware Dead by Daylight a gore filled rated R game is a thing and How the fuck does a 9 year old know what "plank X plank" means. Either you're a bad parent or you're lieing
---
Yes I have, and it's monitored, as she's 9. Call in the authorities.. my daughter isn't a fortnite robot and has an imagination... We must make her conform.
---
This sounds dumb but I feel like a traitor playing killer so when I do I only slug or do what I must for dailies.
---
As someone whose grinding Leatherface rn, this speakers to my soul
---
Shame for being No credit for ur team
---
I wanna hurt this guy I really do I'm sorry but I do
---
It's really not that deep. Your imagination is running wild here.
---
Good question
---
no its not bad, it just means ur good and also have human empathy
---
Too bad, I’m running hangman’s trick
---
I'm obviously a bad parent.
---
I use the perks
---
Nurses Calling
---
Thanataphobia
---
Discordance
---
And depending on the mood Knockout, Hex Ruin, or Deerstalker.
---
I'm fucking done if they're going to nerf him again. He's completely fine now, on the same tier as Myers I'd say. So nothing weak, but also nothing broken.
---
This would be cool but you cant kill kids in games so.
---
The best hillbilly skins are the old ones that altough you bought with money were really cheap.
---
I dont think you are thinking deep enough about it. Would you show this picture to her grandmother? Would you show this picture to her school teacher? Either way, art is a "form of expression" art comes from the heart, you draw things that interest and inspire you and your nine year old little girl is expressing an interest in intense sexual activity.
---
I've accidentally baited teammates before and I always try to get the killer back on me so they can leave the poor dwight who was just trying to work on the gen I tried looping by.
---
Meg has all good perks.
---
I shouldn't have waste a perk slot on that.
---
I like the idea of adding clementine. Tough as nails seems okay-ish. Not sure if a 10% faster vault is what I would go for. Doesnt seem like big value. I like never go along, mostly because of a fairly novel idea of a skill radius for survivors. I dont know of any other perk that determines its bonus for ally effects on the fact that they are in the terror radius of the killer at the same time as clem. Adventurist is a fun idea, because once you know that NOED is on the map, you have enough time to go hunt for it. Again a perk I wouldnt pick over stuff like DS, DH, etc.
---
How. Fucking. Dare. You.
---
Where the fuck are you getting intense sexual activity from this picture.
---
What was it before?
---
U cant win against good nurses
---
That means you are a newb at both.
---
Playing killer is only easier when you are beggining the game. Then it becomes harder and more stressful. and that is well known by both sides.
---
Needs a thought bubble that says “I know exactly where I’d like to go for dinner”
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/4pLFmjx](https://imgur.com/a/4pLFmjx)  I wasn't sure how close you wanted it.
---
I run devour hope 3 and I like it a lot. The thing is the spawns for it and if you play in higher ranks you are fucked.
---
Let’s be honest, Bill is only using 10% of his power level in this game. 
---
If he was how he is in the l4d2 games he would be the killer.
---
It let's you rush the last gen while injured, without much fear of going down. Stronger in SWF groups than solo players, so I think that's where the killer frustration comes from.
---
There's a DbD cursor??? Wow...
---
Killers shouldn’t have to bring ruin to not get gen rushed. If you bring small game totems aren’t a problem and they waste they’re noed slot. Plus you get an extra advantage against trappers and hags.
---
Bro please hag x secco
---
Are you seriously checking?
---
In the end he depiped cause survivors that bleed out give him no points
---
But how would Chucky get people on the hook?
---
I feel like this could work perfectly well with the "to be continued" meme.
---
looks more like Legion.
---
And what does it has to do with Quetzalcoatl?
---
This had me cracking the fuck up. I’m all for ACTUALCANNIBAL SHAI LEBEOWF
---
Thank you! And I don’t really have anywhere else that I post but I plan on posting more on reddit :)
---
I actually haven't seen to much noed in my games since the totem point total change but if I do see constant noeds I run small and make a loop around the map I can usual get all the totems while my team does ~2-3 gens I do the same for constant ruins.
---
Shes running her hand down her leg twords her private parts and from the look on meg's face she was not even expecting getting grabbed force kissed and felt up by nea. This would be a rapescene if not for the blush effect on meg implying she is enjoying it. You need to reflect on this and talk to your nine year old about sex. This is not okay for a nine year old to do.
---
There is a meme edit of this I could try and send the link
---
I already did it but I haven't use iri seal or apple. I killed one person with only puking :D
---
Yeah takes a whole 3 seconds btw, u gonna ask people if they're seriously following next or that's just logical and not cringe?
---
Doctor is the weird case in then when i stated (a month after he came out) I thought he was SO OP. With time you realize he's actually underpowered.
---
Anyways, I think the devs stopped trying for the complete horror theme a while go to focus on more interesting killer powers
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cng1k6/dead_by_daylight_asmr_edition/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
How do I glitch that
---
The one in the game looks like a blend of 1984 Freddy and 2010 Freddy.  Very odd.
---
Idk why but people forget that it's established that Chucky still retains the strength of a full grown man. He could easily lift up a survivor and yeet em up there
---
This literally happened to me 10 minutes ago.  I was cleansing Ruin.  Hag was running Thrill, so I had to circle back and wait for her to get in a chase with someone.  As I'm halfway through cleansing some derpy Meg runs right up to me.  Hag teleports, goes for me and not the Meg.  Hook ensues.
---
Worked out though, because that Hag was terrified of me cleansing that totem, so she wasted a ton of time patrolling that area when I was unhooked (safely, surprisingly).  I eventually cleansed it.
---
D Hope 1 only had the Mori, so you could hide it until you killed them
---
I see map offerings more games than not
---
I JUST HAD THE MOST AVOIDABLE DEATH BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS TO JUST CROUCH AND ALSO THAT'S SHE CAN'T FUCKING TELEPORT ANYWAYS WHILE TRANSPORTING A BODY
---
I don't know how you think it's easy, I get so stressed out on killer lol (rank 9)
---
Mall ninja ghostface
---
Ook buddy
---
I would love to see all of these. Although I think Pinhead would be listed as "The Hell Priest". That's what the books etc. eventually call him.
---
This is honestly why I love Stridor. I use it on my Nurse and you're basically inescapable after hitting someone if you have half a lick of game sense.
---
IT’S EVEN WORSE BECAUSE I WORK IN A GROCERY STORE!
---
That's just sad.
---
You almost had me
---
I want it to kind of be like the Overwatch ranking systems, where whatever color you're at by the end of the season, they award you with a listed amount of auric cells or Iridescent Shards
---
I would really love the druid from Slasher season 3. It would be a sick killer
---
how do you check? what if someones twitch and reddit name are different
---
Ah
---
I love when I come back to the hook and see someone healing the unhooked person directly underneath the hook, and then when I come close they Sprint Burst away while the other Survivor keeps close cause they have 3 Inch Hard and can't get more than 3 Inches with their Exhaustion perk.
---
&gt; So again was this a ranked live match or a KYF match?
---
This was actually an MLG tournament for $20,000,000 and his DC cost the guy who Kobe'd the opportunity to win some cash and pay for his dying father's heart transplant.  Very sad story.
---
You're trash.
---
That bottom frame though
---
Loool seriously. A rape scene. I think you're the one with the fucked mind here.
---
I wasn't expecting that but that was perfect thank you.
---
Just waiting for some hate comments to flow on in. Don't mind me.
---
Survivor Rule for Killer number #53789175 - At the end of a match, a Killer must admit to all the rules they broke and demand forgiveness from the Survivors. Even if they don't think they broke a rule, they did.
---
Teen Andy from Child's Play 3 could work.
---
It's factual I hate it
---
I honestly just use Devour Hope for the free Exposed Effect, that and it acts like it's own Ruin once the Survivors realize *oh shit, I NEED to break that Totem.* There have only been a few moments where Devour worked in my favor, but  my god is it fun once it does
---
Okay well good luck with that whole "being a good parent" thing. You've had your chance to hear reason.
---
Ah yes, the ole bbmg
---
It would be better to have tokens consumed. 
---
Starting with more tokens and then having a player not alert a killer via visual queue only audio of a fast vault, cleansing of a hex or gen exploding if it happens and those end up consuming 1 token and if the killer has bbq chili 2 tokens are consumed. You start with 8 tokens. 4 hooks and you lose them. Too many fast faults and you lose them. 
---
It would be a better dynamic and would make it a much stronger perk.
---
STUPID BHVR TRYING TO MAKE MONEY!.!b!!v
---
I knew it, and the guys following aren't sad right? Aids.
---
You just check follower-count.
---
They always go for the unhook. Great to camp 4man swf because they get desperate to save their friend.
---
Commit birth of Spirit
---
And what does this have to do with dbd...?
---
When you run around the entire map and not a single gen has been touched
---
I didn’t make the edit but it’s cool
---
Yes, it all makes sense now
---
Oooh with all due respect boii might want to delete that comment before the mods get mad about name-and-shame monkaS.
---
I wouldn't use Iron Grasp unless you're going for a basement build. Sloppy butcher is a pretty okay perk.
---
A Myers did this for me last night, but neither of us could find the last survivor so I pointed at a hook and moved on. The guy got hatch instantly..
---
I think the joke was just meming about genrushing being a thing. PSA: it's not
---
Ok, that might help a lot! Thanks for the tip!
---
&gt;The goal of course is to escape.
---
The goal is the maximum amount of possible blood points per minute spent in the match. 
---
Survival is one contributing factor to that.
---
The truth to this! Killers honestly so easy up til red ranks
---
A while back matthieu responded to someone saying the game was frustrating by recommending they play something else like civ
---
You either dont know how to play with him effecticely or you arent using perks that help him in chasses. 
---
I love playing legion but i had to stopped using him because i was constantly 2 pipping and reaching red ranks too fast.
---
While playing legion you need to think fast either go look for another person or turn off your power and continue the chase with the person you hit. Now that his movement speed is 115% he isnt that bad of an M1 killer
---
*Dogs howling in the distance and sound of glass breaking*

I’ve found that a lot of people have struggle perks and I just like to have the reassurance

Exactly or try to flashlight save which makes it clear that theres only 2 people working on gens and that if i hit the guy with the flashlight someone else is gonna have to go get the hooked one.

Its not easy like some swf feel like a military squad all organized, solid, like a well oiled machine, but hell what you gonna do against that xD Atleast take 1
---
I do the same thing on the same map yesterday
---
"Adventurist". I think you mean useless version of small game. Anyway how do you make these survivor/killer profiles. Like, how you make the perk images?
---
Don't you know that placing a trap at the hook is considered camping?  Another frequent bit of salt I experience often.
---
He was likely de-pipping anyways so may as well mess around.
---
I agree here that’s what this post was SUPPOSED to be about 😅
---
DBP for this one still wouldn't make me use it. I'd like to see some kind of fun tangible effect rather than just bp farming or a slight hastening to sacrifices.

Also, Tommy Jarvis’ actor would probably be on board and let them use his face and voice for cheap, he’s a super cool guy in real life that loves anything horror related. I’d eat someone’s ass to play as Tommy Jarvis in DBD, it was the best part of the Friday game
---
You got lucky, one more second and he would’ve pulled you off the generator
---
you’re stupid if you think a 9 year old drew this
---
I am *VERY* shocked the Killer didn't DC there.
---
so u were...actually using a killer’s abilities? Too far
---
I mean, it'd make one hell of a notification

[Useful link](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Make_Your_Choice).
---
If a survivor is unhooked **outside of 32m**, then the unhooker gets hit with the Exposed effect for 40/50/60 seconds, depending on rarity. Exposed means they go down in one hit.
---
After it activates, it has a 40/50/60 second cooldown until it can be triggered again.
---
It's popular on fast killers that lack built-in instadowns, since you can quickly go back to the hook for an easy punish and snowball, but it's also surprisingly handy on Doctor as his insane (no pun intended) tracking abilities make it very easy to find locate the fleeing survivors - and Doctor needs all the help he can get when it comes to keeping pressure on survivors.
---
I was also..

Head On, apply directly to the 4head

Honestly while I still hate Head On since it's still buggy as shit I'm loving all the people who are managing to make it work.

I'm usually not ranting about it but why it's Hillbilly who has like no skins available with shards? And Jane has one million of them, even if she's a new character

I agree

jane has two

Thanks man, DBD isn’t for everyone that’s for sure

Using a Feng to break a pallet breaks it 15% faster because Fengs are so fucking dense. :^) (No hate to Feng mains)

Thats how reddit works

Using a killer ability that doesn’t even injure the survivors?! How very dare you!
---
tfw your ruin spawns 2 feet away from a survivor and you're all the way across the map
---
Why would he fit perfectly? Because he died despite the Entity doing what the hell it wants and takes people from all paths of life?
---
I think what makes red ranks more difficult is you’re playing against 4 survivors that actually focus on pipping up and everyone has an ass time ranking up so everyones sweating, but i mean i guess killers ez all the time ;-)
---
Your telling me. I shit my pants every Hag match.
---
Ugh, you know some kids show talent early. It’s possible and I’d rather be wrong thinking a 9 year old drew the thing than crapping on something a 9 year old could have drawn. Cause if I’m wrong and it wasn’t, then whatever, I let it go. But I’d feel like a huge asshole if I found out she did drawn it. Almost like the kind of asshole calling people stupid over the internet when you don’t even know the person.
---
Rank reset is chaos and camping works best against disorganised survivors.
---
This comment section
---
I don't think he is that bad, he just feels so weak and his shortcoming just feel so strong
---
i let the last person find the hatch or leave through the gate unless their playing meg
---
that doesnt work like that. It's a 4% each time.
---
What?
---
You just sad it yourself, he jus cant compete ad higher ranks. He needs a buff or something. I think the freddy rework is fine, i dont play survivor alot but after a couple of games freddy seems fine and fun to play against
---
You are
---
What "shit" do they have going on with licensed killers?
---
This...so much this!
---
I honestly like the new DS, but I think it should be reworked so once unhooked it stays active until fully healed
---
Wait what! There's a bloodpoint grind rework coming?! When? What has been said about it? I'm out of the loop. I'd say once we know when it releases, save up 1 mil BP for it, but keep using any you need to use to not waste BP. God I hope they remove some useless offerings like luck or some of the minor BP boosts that are nearly worthless. Or even better, just make it so there's one single rank per perk.
---
Truthfully, you just need to pick up one perk per bloodweb, and the rest it doesn't matter much. Yellow and brown items are so easy to come by, you can very easily burn dozens learning what you value over others. Greens and pinks aren't super rare when you're over level 40 either. Guides are less valuable than experience, and memes are a whole lot less useful than guides.
---
Thank you, thats pretty much my point
---
Oh, I also like Windows of Opportunity!
---
That's called camping. Ensuring a survivor can't make use of often broken map design and pallet placement, and it gets hate for a lot of reasons, even though it's the fastest way to get a kill.
---
If you really think that survivors being able to load up the toolboxes and pop a generator in 56 seconds, for three generators, while the Killer is still finding and chasing their first survivor then something is wrong with you.
---
There isn't any kind of pressure to counter that - the pallets in the map alone extend the chase by enough to get three generator pops before your first down. It's true no matter which survivor you find and go after, and gets worse if you drop a chase without a down.
---
Another fan of Lithe too, this makes me happy :)
---
Clementine ehhhh it's a no for me dawg. I like the perks tho
---
But you depip / safety pip
---
Glad we are on the same point
---
You're the one who's crying and downvoting everyone who disagrees with you like a mad kid. Just average survivor main.
---
Don't worry, I'll follow him when I get home.
---
Totems are an interesting concept with a flawed implementation,i think.   
---
The spawning algorithm just seems like it's on crack or something.  
---
Maybe force them to spawn a certain distance apart from each other and survivor spawns?   
---
seems like the logical thing to me.
---
Shit that's a little too similar to how I've played games in the past with Devour Hope, it's a bad habit
---
Considering all licensed killers have to be paid for with real money, some cosmetics for them cost real money, and even some cosmetics for unlicensed killers cost real money, there is no reason why we shouldn't be able to buy most of the cosmetics for a killer that was in game from the start, with shards.
---
Good, I want to beat children so this would be a fine addition.
---
It's a crime against humanity, truly.
---
Bro I'm told he's played a ton at high lvl console. I play him fine at rank 11 pc
---
Shouldn't be knowing what exactly?
---
Nea's misinformation campaign is working
---
most people in your rank maybe. at high ranks you pretty much have to
---
As far as the stun goes, its the same with most abilities involving fast movement. Billy's chainsaw, nurses blink, it does thay to balance
---
Just close your game in the offering screen. Everybody keeps their items/offerings and nobody depips. They can play on their favourite Coldwind Farm with the next killer.
---
I play killer and survivor, and mori’s aren’t toxic but their a bailout win that takes little skill to use. Killing each player 1-2 chases before they’d be full dead on hooks shortens tf outta the game and could make a 2k into a 4k. If they added an offering for survivors that had the same potential to shorten/end a match so quickly, killer mains would LOSE THEIR SHIT. Killers can and should use whatever they want but acting like a win with mori’s holds the same value as a win without one will never make sense to me lmfao. I’ll stick to watching people who win with strategy so maybe I learn something, not someone who wins with offerings.
---
Yes, old fishing game. You put a wiggly on the hook and wait until they take it.
---
Are you ok?
---
Happens even when the hag isn't the killer
---
Funny but downvoted for the leave
---
Lol
---
By god george! You cracked the case!

Too bad no one came to rescue me lmao, at least my team got gens done I guess

Sadly the internet is one of the most judgemental places ever. Doubt is always planted somewhere no matter what. Perhaps it’s jealousy as well, they can’t believe a 9 year old could have that kind of talent, I honestly don’t know. I believe a 9 year old could do this cause I’ve seen children that age sing, dance, play a musical instrument just as good as an adult. So I believe a 9 year old could have drawn this and again, I say, your daughter is very talented.
---
The same happened to me
---
This happened to me last night and all my survs thought I rage quit. Never DC... I'm no wimp
---
wait what??? killing people fast is camping? I never even mentioned broken map design or pallet placement, i literally only said that the killer was unbalanced in this hypothetical. You're literally doing the "if they're on the map, it's camping" meme unironically right now
---
My main point is that "gen rushing" puts the blame on the survivor instead of the devs, but you know what? you're framing this totally disingenuously as it's never going to be 56 seconds. they have to find a gen, they have to avoid you, especially if you're applying ANY pressure. You know people win against all red rank survivor teams right? there are all sorts of perks and strategies. 
---
if you're seriously getting 3 gens popped before first down that often then you're definitely doing something very wrong. you need better patrols, you need to know when to leave a chase, you need better perks. You can complain that you need to rely on perks too much, sure, i'm not even against some solution to generator time to make ruin less necessary, but "gen rushing" is legitimately as dumb as saying "kill rushing". they're the main objective, no shit people will do their best to get them done as fast as they can, that's the literal point. don't like it? blame the devs, not the players for playing as literally intended
---
Ghostface except he’s a 15 year old’s Supervillain OC on DCuniverse
---
I know, but none of them has a 4 second stun
---
Funny that did happen to me a game ago against a hag. I’d try to get someone to bait the killer into going somewhere and then another person cleansing.
---
I just want to do gens😞
---
Clearly lag/delay.
---
Bro speed limiter op it's the ultimate mind game they sometimes stand there thinking they're already down
---
Yeah but everyone already talks about that one.
---
I wanna see these two in court, and Mathieu is the judge.
---
LOL, that’s a good way to look at it. That’s what I tried doing when I got the angry message. Got him off the hook and as I did heartbeat came back. So I went to take the hit but killer went right by me and went after him. Nothing I could do about that but it was my fault somehow because I run wglf.
---
That's because BHVR has to pay the license holders, and they obviously aren't going to want to lose money. I get that you want things for free, but that's not how a business can be run.
---
I always struggle nowadays because I'm not letting them take me to the hatch so they can close it and bm
---
Adrenaline rewards survivors who gen-jockey; the survivor objective is accomplished at a truly neck-breaking pace compared to M1 Killers getting downs.
---
NOED gives Killers who are mechanically, by both power design (eg: Wraith) and map design (Haddonfield, Lery's window 'infinites', Fractured Cowshed, Groaning Storehouse) weak and struggle to perform at all a chance to have an endgame.
---
Let's not pretend that finding someone as Wraith or Trapper and hooking them before your toolbox-SWF pops three generators is simple, you've got 70\~ seconds (64 to pop gen, 6 or so for them to sprint to nearest gen) to find, chase, down, and hook that survivor and then reach one of the generators being repaired before it pops, which even if you do one of the other survivors can pop it as well.
---
Even solos are gonna be in the same position, except without toolboxes the Killer gets 16 more seconds of breathing room - that's not a lot between huge building loops, safe pallets, and balanced landing.
---
Hence, NOED, the design of the objective is not in the Killer's favor and makes it almost impossible to defend, generator speed is not particularly fair unless you're Nurse; and people need to stop pretending it is.
---
So I guess that's a yes on you crying about any of that being reverted? Good, next time try and figure that out on your own before posting something stupid.
---
Maabe its firstest language arnt engeish
---
Since no one else mentioned this beautiful yet idea/joke
---
Can Mr X's terror radius be DMX - X Gon Give It To Ya?
---
That would be a cool perk to have as a survivor(Prob OP). Also where the fuck was that myers going? was he checking a totem or something? Theirs no reason to go their and look for anyone.

Correction:32. She has 32 cosmetics in general. 12 leg cosmetics, 12 chest cosmetics, and 8 head cosmetics. She has 12 complete outfits. 4 are recolors of her regular striped suit, 3 are a non-striped suit (each in a different color), 2 are her in a skirt with boots, 1 is her in an arts and crafts outfit, 1 is her beach outfit, and the last one is her magazine outfit. 3 out of 12 of these cost money.
---
🤦‍♀️read MilkmanForever's comment again but slowly
---
cawm down is only englesh
---
Not everyone cares you grammar Nazi get off your high horse.
---
maybe i’m just bad then
---
Big brain moment: maybe if you weren't shit at actually escaping from a chase you wouldn't get camped on the hook, since most campers are inherently bad killers anyway trying to secure the one down they've managed to achieve. If you're that bad that you allow them to even catch you and hook you so they can actually camp you, you kind of deserve to be camped at that point. And in my experience most killers that camp will do it because you're straight up teabagging and flashlighting and overall being a toxic little shit that is literally begging to be the first downed, first to die.
---
he wasn’t on about recolours, thats takes the number of outfits down to 2, her beach outfit and her red dress outfit
---
wtf I love Laurie why would you say this
---
Damn!
---
Shirtless Myers Main here, with the new updated Corn I’ve found it easier to find people now and stalking is a little more easier even in the corn, but I normally run the reed with dead rabbit or the memorial letter with reed and stalkup just fine. But if you ever wanna try a dirty build run scratch mirror and burn a coldwind offering, they won’t be able to hide in the corn ☠️🔪
---
But depending on the players I will run around in tier 1 for a few just to jump scare them, then go all in plus it’s fucks with them thinking your running a scratch mirror Myers and he will be slow. 😈
---
Don't even talk about posting something stupid, when you're the one who's crying here.
---
Also, learn to read and your profile is something else, damn. Just you average toxic garbage survivor.
---
Shes gonna need a lot of luck that's for sure
---
They should be on the aisle with the salad dressings, in either a pouch or a spice shaker. Make sure to get the real bacon bits not the imitation crap.
---
Killer can turn it on and since it’s a disadvantage for the killer they can get like 25-50% more blood points
---
They can pay them using the money they make from their characters. There is no reason for them to charge people for most of the cosmetics for a killer that was in game from the start.
---
Netflix paid for it tho...
---
i wish this was a perk
---
It's funny how the games progression system screams "pick one survivor and only play him" while the quests try to punish you for doing that.
---
Happened to me in 3 games against a cannibal, shape with J. memorial and the other good green add-on wouldn’t leave and got stalk at every attempt and the last one was a plag with the less vomit needed add-ons.
---
It's not that the Claudette isn't toxic. It's about the clothing
---
Who gives a rats hat about the fifth token. The third token is everything
---
I REMEMBER THESE ANIMATIONS! What was this from??
---
Finding survivors isn’t the hard part, it’s the fact that you can’t stalk through the corn most of the time because the game treats it as a barrier.
---
Also I play ghosty not Myers
---
Do people still play that game?
---
When luck is bad, who can you really complain to tho? Lmao
---
I’ll take a bigger risk for my friend than for randoms
---
Damn that feels bad. There’s not much you can do against them :/
---
Disagree, weaker killers should just be straight up buffed or reworked, not meant to rely on addons
---
I found this in New, I sorted by Hot and here you are, congratulations!
---
Quick and quiet is below average
---
Not against disorganized survivors.
---
Organized survivors, even solos, are going to pop three generators at the same time before you get a second down (or even before the first down if the guy you find knows how to pallet stun and break your bloodlust/is running an exhaustion perk).
---
They will also complete all five generators if you camp, because hook stages are so comparatively long to generator repair time, and they can still potentially rescue the guy you're camping.
---
Disorganized survivors are gonna run around doing totems/chests and individually checking for the save, may even try to save, and get injured/scared away and waste 40-50 seconds, or more.
---
Plus for their second victim the Killer doesn't have to facecamp the full 120 seconds, either, just has to make sure they enter struggle on their first hook, which means if you haven't popped four generators yet already they might be coming for you.
---
Good survivors don’t heal anyway. Would be pretty OP.
---
Even without recolors, she has 5 outfits that aren't her original.
---
What is your yt? I would love to watch
---
please just fucking quit dbd. if you get this mad at a game then dont play it
---
They said this in the latest AMA

**Q:** [Have you ever considered removing perk tiers to reduce grind?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxtl6/)
---
**A:** We have considered it. We went another way but the goal is the same: to ease on the perk grind and promote an easier access to more perks. We are releasing these changes in the upcoming chapter update. To give you more information, we are also preparing a blogpost to explain the upcoming changes. This blogpost should be available in a few weeks
---
All of Claudettes perks are pretty good, can't argue with that
---
5 seconds stun is enough to get away
---
Yea it’s shit and it’s so damn common at rank 8-12 on PS4.
---
"Eat my butt!"
---
The odds are you will lose doing that if you don’t get 3 gems done before the first person is dead then it’s going to be a hatch game.

Oh lol
---
THAT SUCKS SO BAD! OUR ENTIRE TEAM WAS FUCKING DOWNED BY BASEMENT CAMPER INSIDIOUS BUBBA YESTERDAY! NONE OF US KNEW HE WAS STILL DOWN THERE!
---
I'm sorry but this is not healthy behavior for a nine year old, while you should be open and supporting of sexuality you shouldn't be endorsing it specifically at such a young age
---
Played a game yesterday, one guy was afk, the other two did not touch a gen all game. The other two somehow managed to get chased by the killer at the same time, even when I was looping him they would crouch around me doing nothing, it was terrible.
---
Servers?
---
This is KittyChipz, the Jendenise wannabe
---
What does being in the game from the start have to do with anything? You're completely clueless on how to run a business.
---
Oh wow, that's awesome :O Glad they are finally doing something about it. Because the barrier of entrance is getting too damn high.
---
You know if a chase is taking too long and you're worried about gens you can just.. walk away right? You know this is the right call to make in a lot of situations right??? There's nothing that MAKES you chase a survivor until they're down. The entire concept of map pressure is scaring people off gens, regressing gens, and the chasing people with the extra time you've made.
---
The survivor only chooses how long the chase is if you intend to down them, and even then there's the whole side of killer mind game skill too. 
---
playing killer is pressure, regress, chase, repeat. people who complain about gen rushing seem to only know about the chasing part though and it's why they think this is such a massive problem
---
They weren’t talking about raising the stun to 2 mins lol, and yes 5 seconds is enough time to get away.
---
They said the killer now drops and dribbles you if they think you have it, and thats basically makes the perk useless now.
---
Well sometimes they need to blame someone I guess. Thankfully on PS4 I don’t get too many angry messages, but they happen and it’s always someone, no matter what you say to justify yourself, it’s your fault. I had another get mad and accuse me of not being healed on the ground when I know I was. They thought I didn’t heal on purpose so I could steal their key. But I was fully healed and they said I wasn’t. Didn’t matter what I said, she had made up her mind and nothing I said could convince her otherwise. Even offered proof with the saved footage but they never responded.
---
Increased fatigue is the only thing that is fair but I don’t think that would make a difference at top tier.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
This is clearly a joke.
---
&gt;It’s obvious in the lore of their games that they die but of course the entity pulled Bill in before that happened and could do the same for Lee.
---
That good ol' Amanda and Saw treatment
---
I I never get thanked lol but as long as they didnt tea bag me I'm not mad
---
No just people whining about him he’s B tier at best and I’d like him to stay that way
---
Well the answer certainly isnt hide near the hook and wait for the killer to leave. Killer is camping = do fucking gens. Cant hit ruin checks? Get better at it. 
---
Hag fucking sucks to play against for this exact scenario. Her entire power is being a proxy camper. Borrowed Time/D Strike are all you really have.
---
Doin gens u?
---
You cant dribble ds anymore. The skillcheck occurs during pickup animation.
---
And what if I'm not on PC? What then?
---
One is fine the other wrist is hanging by a thread. Thats mine though just use Self Care
---
A closed hand might be easier.
---
In my case I'm less focused when playing with friends compared to solo.
---
Friend #1: "So how was everyone's day?"
---
Me: "Oh dude, we had the dumbest bug. When you tried to create an account, you couldn't select Woman, it would always select Man. So once we noticed, and fixed it our commit message was "Allowed women to create accounts" "
---
Friends: *laugh*
---
Me: *horrified scream*
---
Friend #2: "What happened"
---
Me: "Got grabbed"
---
Friend #2:  "Who is it? Myers? Pig? Spirit?"
---
Me: "Nah, Huntress couldn't hear the heart beat because of the laughter"
---
Generally speaking, we talk more about random stuff than focusing on the game. And we also try to sabotage each other for fun.
---
Me: *sees Myers* "Guys it's a Clown"
---
Friend: "Gotch ya", *scream, gets grabbed off a generator* 
---
Friend: "Fuck you"
---
Exactly,
---
I think in the new DbD mobile survivors all share items. Thatd be cool. 
---
The game is balanced around all 4 survivors bringing an item &amp; offering every game. To many players have this hoarder mentality where they feel the need to save all their shit for a rainy day. Bring an item EVERY.SINGLE.GAME. Even if its just a brown box for medkit.
---
You could open the exit gate in 8.5 seconds with survivor and 15 seconds without.
---
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh normal people would think that challenging yourself would be the way to keep things interesting, not use crutches that even a 200 hour player could win with. It's like when you're a pro basketballplayer and after 7000 hours instead of going against other pro basketball players you go against some 12 year old kids who are half your size, it's really considered pathetic but not when you do it in DBD I guess.
---
Haunted grounds time
---
do we need /s on everything
---
So when has she witnessed sexually lifting your partners leg while making out? I don't know your relationship with your partner and child but I doubt you're doing that in front of your developing child
---
Preetty sure that is self care
---
What behaviour is unhealthy here? It's a kiss.
---
My art style actually started with me trying to draw OC’a for that show. It’s evolved but I’m glad I wasn’t the only one who made that comparison!
---
No he's mid tier at best.
---
&gt; It's not any different from something like Borrowed Time or DS though.
---
It is. You can choose to go after the unhooker, you can wait out borrowed time's timer, you can down the person and slug them which still give you map pressure. With Mettle there is no timer or counterplay, you are going against a survivor with 3 health states, it's like comparing borrowed time to an instaheal, it's better in every single way.
---
&gt;You can't always just "not facecamp" or "not tunnel" to avoid them.
---
Yes you absolutely can, lmao. You are never forced to facecamp anyone, that's your own choice and it's mostly likely going to be a bad one.
---
&gt;unless you just want the complete deletion or rework of the perk. 
---
I would love the perk's effect to get reworked, or at the very least give it an actual downside. Current one (revealing the aura when healed) does completely nothing.
---
Dude, it's toxic playing the actual game. Stop chasing survivors. /s
---
This community, the bigger part, is pathetic. May you all next encounter such people again. (Of course you will.)
---
I guess it sounds more dramatic when the sound goes off twice for each gen... I wonder why that is.
---
Because he sucks and when he uses it he still loses so nobody complains, that or his braindamage.
---
Haven't played for a while, isn't it top tier on Nurse?
---
How about no!
---
I think they should make this an ability for solo players. It much better than looking at yellow auras through the basement walls.
---
They aren't just kissing they are sexually embracing one another
---
That’s not very nice
---
Thanks! I appreciate it
---
I though it still worked, but I don’t use the perk so I wouldn’t know.
---
Just relaying what OP was mentioning.
---
Not my problem! Promo somewhere else!
---
I think that's just the frustration that most of the Hag's decent strategies are just unfun to play against. ESPECIALLY basement Hag. Don't hate the Hag player tho, hate the killer design.
---
Source: loathe playing against Hag
---
you can already spectate the killer if you enter a KYF lobby in spectator mode.
---
not sure of the spectator limit but it was definitely present last time 6 of us wanted to play. we all took turns spectating rounds.
---
Just put it in numbers.
---
An alien Miller souls rally fit a gap as "The Visitor"
---
you can already spectate all players, including the killer, in a KYF lobby if you enter the lobby in spectator mode.
---
Is whispers a teachable Perk or does it just show up on the blood web, and by BBQ do you mean the cannibal’s perk?
---
Camping is the slowest most stupid way to kill someone... It will only guarantee you more than one kill against a team of idiots.
---
Ok
---
Who's this streamer and does he have a youtube.
---
I think alot of people say Freddy is overpowered is just because of the massive leap in strength he has taken from being arguably one of the weakest killers in the game to becoming now a decent killer. 
---
He is by no means as strong as Spirit or Nurse but he is significantly better than the majority of the M1 killers.
---
Give it a few months and people will stop saying he is overpowered.
---
Every killer who uses their abilities is obviously a toxic camping tunneller!
---
“Mind channel” is the action that you use when carrying a key
---
I do, but it's not a perfect solution. It doesn't really work for Iron Will on Autohaven maps and Lery's. It makes Bill's audio almost non-directional. Ace is still insanely difficult to pick up. Corn becomes problematic because they seem to treat corn like the interior of Temple Of Purgation, meaning sound echoes in the rows and then gets amplified with Stridor.
---
r/IAmOutOfAnythingToSaySoIJustLinkToSomeStupidFaggotReddit
---
wait are you serious what the hell is the point in devotion then hahaha. do you happen to have a link to what they said? i‘d like to read it
---
Whispers is a standard killer perk that can be obtained just randomly from the bloodweb on all killers. And yep, BBQ is one of the Cannibal's personal perks. It's a good tracking tool as well as gives you sweet, sweet extra bloodpoints.
---
That's my favorite kind of chill build, Insidious in the basement, only attack if they come down and stop following them once they get to the top of the stairs.

Yes his/my  name is UPLAYN2, on Twitch and Youtube

Still more than Hillbilly
---
When I was playing as a solo Survivor the other day from the get-go I had the Killer chasing me for five minutes or something and during that whole time not a single gen had been touched by the other three players. There wasn't even a Hex: Ruin active. By the time I was finally hooked the other three all then simultaneously decided to work on gens and left me hooked until I died. I went from the stage 1 hooking through the entire struggle and not one of them came to save me. What really baffled me was, why not do anything the whole time I'm distracting the Killer and then decide to all do stuff the entire time I can be hooked?
---
Seems like a pretty good job
---
There literally is no mind game if it's long loops or someone just plain runs from pallet to pallet and drops them.
---
Oh lmao sorry thought you were just a viewer, thanks for the quick reply, ill defo check you out.
---
Well it is toxic, just like irri heads and prayer beads, it's all just killers knowingly using overpowered shit that BHVR forgot to nerf to piss people off, if that's not toxic than nothing is.
---
Yeah killers would lose their shit, they are just willfully delusional about how trash they are in the same way an aimbotter probably wouldn't admit that he's trash, literally ebony is saying "I'm trash I need this to win" but they either don't care or are too stupid to understand it.
---
Lol.. Sneaky
---
Lol No problem at all
---
Oh well I'm sure the killers at rank 15 will forgive you.
---
1 more and either way, the outfits cost so many shards, its just better to buy them
---
WHATS WITH THE DAMN MOVEMENT SLOWDOWN??! (XBOX One)
---
It happens as both survivor and killer and it started about 3.0.0 with Bill/Freddy. I'm so tired of this. As survivor this gives the killer an unnatural ability to catch the survivor faster even in a healthy state. Running animation yet movement of a slow walk. 
---
This morning in have lost with Freddy and Trapper due to this same issue. The speed and everything else was fine the whole game until the end when 2 survivors were able to escape as I lost distance from this slow down. 
---
THIS NEEDS PATCHING! HOW HAVE I NOT SEEN ANYONE ELSE COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS??
---
This isn't lag. This is full movement speed drop on both sides and I been deal with it unaddressed for 2 patch updates
---
When you don't have an actual comeback so you try to say another survivor is a low rank even tho you don't know them or have played them.
---
It's not my first language either. It's not an excuse, not in the slightest.
---
Oh riight. Didn't know you can spectate there. But that makes my point even more valid meaning they could easily add the killer spectating feature to a dead survivor in KYF.
---
Since survivors are belly down when downed, Chucky could ride on their backs and control them like voodoo zombie mounts. They could emit a visible aura to distinguish them from other survivors and would just drop Chucky, who's stunned on the ground for the duration. As for the hooking animation, he could use some kind of weird telepathic pirouette or something like that so he can jump back to the ground...
---
Haha le funneh u did the thing XDD
---
Someone skipped statistics
---
Switch Ruin for Bitter Murmur for some fun snipes :)
---
Devs have said they won't unban you if EAC bans you, but I've heard people say they've gotten unbanned, so I'm not sure. I'd take the devs word for it, and like you I've been interested but it's just not worth it to me.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Of course, but I don't play like trash. So when there are 3 survivors left, 2 of them dead on hook, the thought process they have to go through to deduct weather or not the killer that used efficient mindgames and downed everyone really fast has noed.
---
I've only ever seen bad killers use NOED.
---
Myers has a KILLER body.
---
Right, imma go commit die now.
---
When does never go alone actually activate? What's its trigger?
---
That's incredibly over powered
---
Take down those dirty fucking gen camping survivors too!
---
Tough as nails seems like a shitty lithe
---
If they're just learning the language, yeah it is an excuse. You can't expect everyone to be perfect at speaking English just because you are.
---
Depending where you are, but I don’t know, I would like a timer of 1 minute 30 seconds instead of 60 seconds, for what it’s been reworked to I don’t use it anymore unless it’s one of those nights where everyone is on a tunnel fest.
---
Remove extra blink addons, make fatigue last like 3-4 seconds instead of 1. And nerf omegablink addons so they actually have a downside to them, because accuracy doesn't do anything.
---
if you patrol well and end your chases when they get so long that you're worried people will get a bunch of gens done, then your mobility is fine enough, yes high mobility killers tend to be the best because of their better pressure, but the other killers are still plenty viable. You can 100% leave a chase, it's that simple
---
if you do gens over healing then you have a team that is essentially exposed and easy to find  the entire match unless they use up a valuable perk slot  for iron will, and you can also take thanata if it's that much of an issue for you. and you DO win if you get out, wtf??? I also wasn't aware that doing the main objective of the game was avoiding playing the game, cool take
---
"kill rushing exists" got it, if you unironically think that camping or tunneling work well in games, then you trying to play the "maybe at your ranks" insult is hilarious as there's no way you play above a rank 14 skill level. that shit will get you 1ks or mayybe 2ks every time unless the team is all low ranks who won't stick on gens while somebody is camping
---
Ofcourse they do, once someone is injured vs spirit it's basically like facing the old legion where you just always go down, the only "CoUnTeR" was using 25% of your loadout to counter 1 killer in the game, let's hope they don't make more killers  as strong as spirit because we only have 4 perkslots. But even that wasn't strong enough for BHVR better make sure she can still get her braindead legion-level 2nd hits in by "CoUnTeRiNg ThE CoUnTeR". also spirit is overpowered and easy to play.
---
I would love this idea and I’d ditch tapp for my girl Clementine.
---
In my experience people care a lot. I currently care because I don't have the rank 1 achievement yet and I want to push myself to see if I am capable of getting to rank 1. Once I hit rank 1, I'll stop caring.
---
They actually did ga e a 2 min timer but changed it to 60 seconds before the PTB and the dribbling didn’t do anything anymore, I laugh when killers dribble because then I know then haven’t played in awhile, but once the killer picks you up you get the skill check and they can’t drop you quick enough to cancel it out...
---
You never "need" Ruin. But gens being done very quickly is never good and some way to slow the game down is always very nice. Ruin, as it turns out, is the best perk in the game at slowing down generator progression. Corrupt Intervention is weaker slow-down but it keeps survivors off three generators for 120 seconds and helps with tracking as it gives you the information that survivors will not be on those three gens. It's an alternative if someone doesn't have Ruin or doesn't like how RNG Ruin can be sometimes (gotta love those totem placements).
---
At least this way I feel less scammed for not getting the reward despite completing 25 games. Next time they'll run their goddamn experiment themselves
---
I want the old DS back too and they can just make it where your seen by the killer for the next 3 mins or something.
---
I read this in Captain Holt's voice when Rosa tells him about Bone.
---
This is something they are (and have for months been) looking into, and are hoping to do soon!
---
It requires about 1/100th of the work involved in creating a cosmetic, but somehow they manage to ship at least one of those every week...
---
Made with meMeaTIc
---
I wasn't saying I leave. I was giving you a suggestion if you don't want to play against a killer who brought a Mori. Yet again you go back to rank even because your tiny mind won't allow you to think of something better to say. This honestly just pathetic
---
I am going to be honest; I have been camped by huntresses more than bubba and any other killer.
---
I just made it up because I thought it would be funny.
---
no

Yeah, I was too busy talking shit, and I also wasn't expecting her to be behind me cause she had JUST hooked that guy
---
Happened to me
---
Yeah, this system worked when there were 10 survivors and 9 killers, now is just plain stupid.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Nice one.
---
Doing gens hby?
---
Last couple of patches the 'Ready' button will randomly disable on me so I just gotta sit there and wait like a jerk :(
---
The bug where you can’t heal or exit?
---
That map is the worst map in the game; change my mind
---
Deleted all his messages
---
Call it an unpopular opinion but I'm ok with how distortion works right now. If you go against a killer with barbecue, you lose those tokens fairly quick if it's an unlucky matchup with fellow survivors. The only time the current setup is unfortunate is going against Freddy if he puts you in dream state, as it just eats your tokens within a minute
---
God i love this joke
---
It gets more annoying the further you climb the ranks.
---
I swear, I have no idea how some survivors got to red ranks by doing almost nothing, and dying easily. Like, how did they get here, and how do they maintain this rank? 
---
Meanwhile, I'm crushing gens and looping as long as I can, going for saves and distracting the killer when possible... I depip, and I die last with most of the Gen work under my belt, but I keep seeing the same type of teammates, who seem to have no problem piping by hiding in a corner most of the game.
---
I have to CHASE teammates to get heals when the killer is obviously across the map picking someone up.
---
Oh i could heal just fine. Exiting I could not
---
Killer mains make it seem like survivor is a walk in the park lol meanwhile solo q is 10x a worse experience than killer (even vs SwF) and then you get bullshit for BP at the end of it
---
Please, don't touch him anymore. He's completely fine now. Seriously finally he's playable and actually strong, but not completely broken. I'm fucking done if they'll nerf him again. He's Freddy fucking Krueger after all, he's supposed to be dangerous and scary and not free win for survivors.
---
I'd say he's on the same tier as Myers. Can be really dangerous, but also can be easily overplayed and usually only strong only thanks to his addons. He's also, as Myers, dominating lower ranks because people simply don't know how to play against him. I mean people on lower ranks let Myers stare at them as long as he wants because they think he's afk or something, of course they have problems with Freddy.  When I watch higher rank streamers I almost don't see Freddy at all.
---
By the way fake pallets are fucking amazing, I love when survivors try to teabag me before they throw fake pallet in front on them. One of the best feelings.

The bug has gotten better then, sounds like. It has been happening for a couple months now. At one point, you could not heal, exit, recover, or wiggle. It was really bad. 
---
The “no exit” glitch by itself has been around a long time though. Back in the day, you could reverse it by crossing the threshold again. But the recent issue hasn’t worked that way, so I don’t know.
---
No mither.
---
WELL I'M GETTING ANNOYED BY HOW MANY TIMES I GET PUT AGAINST SURVIVORS WHO ARE 10 RANKS HIGHER THAN ME. I'M AN INNOCENT RANK 13 KILLER AND I KEEP GETTING SURVIVORS IN RED FUCKING RANKS. I CAN'T WIN AGAINST THEM. I JUST GET LOOPED FOR AN HOUR AND THEN THEY ADRENALINE OUT OF THERE. THEN THEY TBAG AT THE EXIT GATE AND LEAVE. WHY CAN'T I JUST GET PUT AGAINST PEOPLE CLOSER TO MY RANK.
---
&gt;Is toxic
---
I think you put it on the wrong side.

When Nea starts stabbing survivors I won't blame her a bit. Leave Nea alone.

Can someone tell me how to counter these god teir 360's a guy  just ran me around the boat on that swamp map which was stressful in itself but I got him in the open I dunno wtf it was he was doing I tried to step back and wait tho he still manage to 360
---
Posted the same thing 12 days ago. Good to know that you cretins haven't grown any extra brain cells.
---
The best: Nurse&gt;Spirit&gt;Hag&gt;Hillbilly
---
The worst Doctor, Legion, Wraith, Leatherface
---
I did get him in the end BTW left him on the floor and teabbaged the life out of him
---
Sorry to tell you, thats tunneling. If you only go after me, for whatever reason, that is the definition of tunneling. And its not like killer is so hard you have to immediately take someone out.
---
And you SHOULD go after the unhooker, to teach them to stop doing unsafe hooks. Because what if that was you on the hook, unable to stop your teammate from farming you? Hmm?
---
Just DC
---
Read the flair
---
This subreddit is a free karma generator. I bet people who don't even know this game come here and paste old memes for free karma.
---
Did you just waste god pallet
---
No I don’t actually, they are exactly the same, and after 2 matches the number fixed itself
---
To counter 360s you just gotta calculate when he is going to attempt and then you just stand completely still watching him 360 the air and smack him with a m1 (no lunge)
---
Yeah it's super confusing, gens are hard to find, and killers terror radius is absolutely annoying on it. Idea is not bad though.
---
Kinda feels like it was solely designed around the pig and her see through walls addon.
---
You must be new here.
---
It's just a bug, carry on with another game. 😁👍
---
It’s two separate departments for bug fixes and cosmetics leave the artists be :(
---
I think Exhaustion addons are pretty strong. I wouldn't say overpowered but they're definitely strong for their rarity. With the exhaustion changes even the common huntress addon effectively disables your exhaustion perks for the rest of the engagement. 
---
I agree it's debatable if they're worth the addon slot as you have no idea if they even are running exhaustion perks, but for example on Clown a "Go to" loadout might be something like Solvent Jug (Exhaustion) and Flask Of Bleach (Extra Slow).
---
 \[Hook\] Hoes Mad (x24)
---
Ah quick attack thx I'll try that
---
Maybe swap MYC out with Infectious Fright to help out a with Thana just a lil bit. Plus I like your add-on combo, its been my go to so far.
---
I'm on XBOX, and at rank 6, and the killers I seem to run into most of the time are Freddy or Trapper. Shit, I wish I was seeing more Ghostface and Myers.
---
Nah. He's great.
---
AHHH ITS SO GOOD
---
I'm not talking lag, you can see there is no lag.  I'm talking about my base speed DROPPING LIKE THERE'S A PERK AFFECTING ME OR SOMETHING. YOU CAN SEE IT!
---
There are no happy ends
---
I can agree situations like this are really frustrating. The speed is less than ideal when a second of a difference changes everything. I will give you respect on patrolling rather than camping, but it is unfortunate that Dwight slipped though it.
---
I mean it looks different for me, like white, but lmao

It's best not to use them at low ranks mate. I only use them if I get a daily.
---
It used to be like that in the past.
---
Did anyone else hear 5 gens pop but only 4 got repaired
---
This is obviously swf. I know the ranking system is not perfect but it is definitely not this fucking bad. You’re not fooling anyone.
---
Ye, I can see that.

he's a solid mid tier now i'd say.

Nowhere near the holy triumvirate of nurse/spirit/billy, and definitely not OP.

It’s a cruel world

Lol get fucked
---
Really like the drawing! Your style kind of reminds me of old Cartoon Network shows so you also get a + from giving me a nice nostalgia trip! Thank you! Amazing drawing, keep at it!!
---
I have a stockpile of like, 23 Ebony Mori’s for that reason. I had recently just had some Green Ones pop up so I figured “It’s just one free Kill”
---
But no, as soon as you Mori the first one, everyone quits/DCs as soon as you down them, I’m guessing because they assume I can Mori everyone.
---
Still super annoying.
---
I expect nothing and I still get disappointed
---
Ditto.  GhostFace hit me from the second floor of the game.
---
Baby dwights find the cracks in everyones armour
---
Happy Cake Day my guy
---
Freddy was one but I only see him in 1 every 8 games.
---
I was so frustrated this whole game... And its happened with survivors. I never experienced this movement speed slow down until the 3.0 patch with Freddy/Bill.
---
That second of a difference you can visually see change as I'm moving on to Dwight on the hook too
---
Ah RIP, that's why you shouldn't make memes when you should be asleep kids lmao
---
Not sure why it was changed. As soon as Survivors see that blocked Offering, they tend to suicide on hook/give up/DC when downed.
---
Sometimes I like to bring a Shroud of Seperation and watch them all DC for no reason.
---
Those perks had to be unlocked as teachables like adrenaline, self-care, etc. His perk borrowed time is one of the best in the game.
---
Yeah same here I got a good few for every killer but there's just no point in using them. I find once you get to purple ranks I get less DCs though.
---
The "My teammates can't possibly screw this up, right?" build.
---
Thank you!! Glad you like my style!!
---
They are his teachable perks and always were on PC just not on console since he originally wasn’t on there.
---
No, I’m being serious, I’m the rank seven who solo queued and somehow got this, I didn’t intend to fool anyone with this
---
&gt; A BT going off is literally the equivalent of a full heal off of a hook since you have to be hit twice before downed and it is repeatable and not 1 time use. DS either allows for the killer to ignore you, slug you, or take a 5 second stun and need to redown you.
---
You **can** play around BT, you **can** play around DS, you cannot play around Mettle of man, it's a non-conditional extra health state.
---
&gt;So they are no different from MoM in terms of countering by literally ignoring the survivor (to avoid activating deep wounds, getting stunned, or ignoring body blocks for stacks) they will all function similarly
---
No it doesn't at all actually, because it doesn't have a timer. You HAVE to deal with Mettle eventually if you want to down that person, while with bt and ds have timers and you can always focus on someone else since there is an unhooker. I haven't had BT or DS trigger against me in like a month because they can be completely played around.
---
Same here, or if I'm going up against someone who's been a toxic asshole in previous games. If I don't have a Green Mori, I'll use a pink one for one or two people.
---
How would you feel if your daughter was Meg in this picture. And Nea was a boy in her class groping her leg, lifting it up, and surprise kissing her.
---
You'd be having a discussion with that kids parents
---
I just checked my P3 Claudette and she has his teachable perks even though I never unlocked them for Bill
---
Copy &amp; Paste from Rage Wednesday post got context:
---
This isn't lag. This is full movement speed drop on both sides and I been deal with it unaddressed for 2 patch updates.
---
Whoever says Nea is a killer is plain idiot.
---
... She is obviously the entity.
---
So many bullied killers
---
Haha I never remember people's names. I used to use them for SWF if they all bring med kits or flashlights.
---
The perks were regular on console like the cat one. I already *had* borrowed time in my loadout! All it changed was that now it says it’s a bill teachable
---
I think they mean specifically spectating killer while on hook. There's no option to swap to spectator mid-game, at least not without also killing your character
---
I noticed that a lot of twitch players on Console at least dc when I hook or mori them
---
SHIT he caught me gotta leave
---
Sounds dramatic cause the sound of completing gens got played twice per each
---
Only on PS4, and if you close application. He isn’t on PS4, and IF he was, he didn’t close app.
---
Yeah because you already unlocked it in her bloodweb. Any character you level now won’t get it until you unlock it on him.
---
Warning:extremely NSFW and NSFL
---
r/sounding
---
Because it's apparently a kink.
---
I can appreciate how we have a meme with a screeching liberal and a meme with a screeching conservative both on the front page. Yay balance
---
They should make finishing a Mori animation give a huge Bloodpoint bonus to Survivors, so that there is at least an incentive to stay and wait the whole thing out. 
---
Even something like +100-200% Bloodpoints earned, or maybe a flat out 10,000 Bloodpoint bonus for being killed would be nice. 
---
I do understand from the other side that Mori’s are frustrating and annoying to Survivors, so I’m not trying to undermine that perspective at all, just a bother that I pretty much waste any Mori I use.
---
If we don't stop being toxic, this lad might actually kill up to 4 people. 
---
#Videogamescausebullying
---
I wanna see a compilation video of cocky survivors succumbing to Bloodwarden.
---
E
---
As a Survivor, its usually the case that when there is an Ebony mori, the killer justs camps and tunnels, and no one wants to play like that.
---
You also have to remember that roughly 70% of all Survivors have the IQ of 10, so expect them to be annoyingly dumb
---
There’s already deliverance, I’m just saying.
---
You're being fucking ridiculous.
---
F
---
Like restore the game files? There's a button for that somewhere in steam options for the game or simply uninstall and reinstall the game I guess, should work, right?
---
A
---
Dude I feel you. That's hardcore man.
---
Oh I see, I misunderstood your question
---
I think that wouldn't really be worth it tbh.  
---
The thing is most killers tunnel especially with a Mori. I still hook survivors twice before I Mori them unless it's towards the end of the game and I need a hand and they have been toxic.
---
He is so menacing when he walks
---
I see your point and, to be clear, I never bitch about NOED. What I was saying is that NOED simply MIGHT feel unfair because survivors usually feel robbed. It's like "We won! We did all gens and you take it from us! That's unfair!!!" and this is the reason why most people don't like it. Look at Devour Hope for example - it's even better than NOED when it works, and I never see anyone who bitches about DH being broken. Personally I like that "oh shit!" moment when NOED pops up or I see Exposed status from Devour Hope it simply means that we, as survivors, fucked up.
---
Its a good old meme
---
Me as a killer : SWF Squadette with instant heals, coldwind farm offering, DH, BT, Adrenaline, Selfcare.
---
Me as a survivor : Teletubbies survivors.
---
I legit said I’m sure that they won’t??? I hardly se even a 1% chance of a TWD series character being added to DBD since Telltale has shut down and they never have licensed their characters to other games. And technically this isn’t even their character to license since it’s involved with The Walking Dead so BHVR would technically have to license from Image Comics as well.
---
How so?
---
I can't be sure but this could be your controller. Like idk if this is a known bug but i've had controllers where the messed up analog sticks completely ruin games for me. And one of them was exactly like this, i could never move full speed forward only diagonally
---
With that one bug recently that made it where Xbox players couldn't even open the game, more than likely you're right. I can only hope they fix it soon.
---
That’s definitely the worst lag hits I’ve seen yet
---
You’re not very smart are you?
---
from gameplay ive seen of dedicated servers it looks broken in a different way
---
im normally on my phone so i dont realize when i go into a match. sorry for the BIG WAIT
---
You can play around MoM though...  You don't HAVE to hit the guy bodyblocking, you don't have to hit the unhooked person bodyblocking, you don't have to go for the unhooked person for the next minute.
---
You're making it sound like they got a free health state(which is literally what DS and BT also give) for free with no effort, which they haven't, you may have had a case with old MoM, but definitely not it's current iteration, this 1 extra hit is a reward for protecting other teammates, which CAN still be played around in terms of delaying giving the stacks, and the usual insta downs from full health, grabs, and entering Deep Wounds(sidenote I don't see many people mention, MoM doesn't activate in DW making it unable to stack with BT and making legion easily counter the perk)
---
I got called a camper because a SWF 3 gen’d themselves.
---
There was an almost finished generator 2 feet in front of the hooked survivor, and one being worked on 10 feet away. Third one untouched.
---
Where am I supposed to go?
---
I feel ya. Good internet and a good pc are great, but you lose out on those sweet latency hits. 
---
I upgraded, and it took me a while to realize I was a used to dealing with lag and hitting skillchecks/survivors with a delay.
---
Broke his arm just to hit that survivor.
---
*crashes Fallout 4, takes this moment to reflect on life and format the hard drives.
---
You're turning an innocent drawing by a kid into something sexual and now bringing issues of consent into it. Ridiculous.
---
Killer can’t see client side glitches. Actually this is one of the only client side glitches in the whole game, the other being sprinting while “working on a gen”.
---
yea i agree with you. i had this when i was playing with my busted controller. bought a new one and never got this problem again.
---
Wow this is the first time I've seen this that looks incredible annoying. What causes it to happen?
---
They both did nothing all game /shrug
---
IMMERSED CLAUDETTES &gt; BIG BRAIN MEGS
---
I don't see anything wrong with supporting a game
---
You are right, except for that part about solo’s. They are perfectly capable of that, yes. But they never will do that on the merit of them being legendary levels of incompetent. Just playing as my (console) nurse against solo’s is tragic. The amount of wasted time they cause is absurd
---
This seems fair lul
---
Damn so it might not be game? The controller is less than a year old and I haven't needed to replace controllers on past consoles. I'm good about not breaking them. 
---
Great.
---
Was a couple of weeks ago, forgot I had it in my capture gallery :)
---
Having to rely on devour hope, hex ruin, blood warden, nobody escapes death, bbq and chilli, haunted grounds and any other perks that rely on totems makes you a crutch killer no skills. And I know I'm about to get some major hate from crutch killers sorry you have no skills it's okay I'm sure you can always go play minecraft it is setup for the simple minded. Now before you try to call me out I play as killer with none of these perks I have mentioned and I get 4 out of 4 kills 80percent of the time. Because of skill and strategic map awareness.
---
Ohhh okay. Thanks
---
You’re welcome!
---
So...you just volunteer to be Exposed?
---
You know we can see your ps4 name an make it public for everyone to spam you I would suggest that you blur your name
---
Maybe by "only started playing 2 hours ago" he meant he just got on and started playing DBD 2 hours ago
---
Killer I will exploit there greed for items hahaha meanwhile in our universe easy win (edit) killer why didn't it work survivors are to op survivors in chat no your just being stupid don't basement camp
---
Five of her add-ons are useless.
---
Everything stronger that Olibalum is decent.
---
CD add-ons don't sound strong, but they let you machine gun Corruption and get easy follow up attacks on Vile when survivors might otherwise vault a window.
---
Anything that enhances Corrupt Purge is strong, but needs to be paired with an Apple.
---
Well someone else said it could be controller. I thought it was in-game since this hadn't been occurring until 3.0 update. I noticed it while pksying Bill and its since carried over to my survivors and killers.
---
And it is. You can’t get borrowed time anymore unless you level up bill. That’s how it was supposed to be. They have console his perks so they wouldn’t be left behind balance wise. When borrowed time first came out it was incredibly strong too
---
Except when I'm survior and everyone instead decides to try to gen rush... When I have the killer as far away as possible from the totem yet no one seems to care :/
---
Lol right
---
Lol I'm watching tbbt at the moment
---
They fixed the *hitbox.* Not the multitude of other problems with the perk.
---
While Stridor is sort of a counter to Iron Will, I don’t run it on my Spirit, simply because I don’t encounter a lot of people using it. I wouldn’t exactly call it meta, though I definitely used to see it a lot more.
---
Might get some hate for this but I still prefer Whispers on my Rin any day and it really shines in early and late game. I use it with Surveillance and it helps me run a real tight gen patrol loop mid-game though BBQ typically takes the stage for most of my mid-game finds.
---
What are some other problems?
---
Add them and tell them to do fucking gens.
---
With Ruin you can spend even more time on gens! Fun, right?
---
Devour Hope does require some level of skill, (and luck) as you need to be able to know when to protect it and when to leave it, which takes some serious mind gaming potential.
---
"Are these guys dumb enough so that I don't have to protect it?"
---
"Are these guys good enough runners that I need to priotize the totem over a potential kill?"
---
Prime example of a crutch killer. No skill or a strategic map mind set.
---
Yes, but the lines for piping move. You need 4 gold or better to pip in red ranks, but only 1 gold and 3 silver in mid ranks. That's a huge difference. 
---
There is a point where you stop climbing easily just by playing, and you have to start thinking about "did they get the safe unhook across the map, or am I going to lose points for that other guy farming?", and "did I do enough Gen work, while being chased all game?".
---
It's super easy to pip when you need 9 emblems, but once it gets to 12, you have to do really good.
---
Getting downed 1 time, or someone failing to safely unhook, can cost you the whole match. Even if someone DC's on the hook, you can depip no matter how well you do otherwise.
---
All you have had to do is either survive a long time and do 1 Gen, or escape and get 1 unhook. Until rank 4.
---
Being a wraith main this would make me switch back to survivor
---
Ugh i hate killers who actively drop people they are carrying once they get their mori. It feels so cheap
---
Well there's a problem that is apart of all of the games: the choices you make really don't matter much (only a few big ones)
---
Is that the “change my mind” guy
---
It’s a swf. Low ranks playing with high rank players. Usually face green rank killers

Your original comment literally says “buggy as shit”. I’m not arguing if Head On is weak or not, I’m saying that it’s not buggy.

For these prices, for the shards to be so hard to get, with so many pieces being locked being ACs only.. With a Battle Pass on its way.. 
---
You're being scammed. 
---
Defending these practices only means them being come common, to motivate them trying out the waters and become even worse. You're but a wallet with a large dollar sign on. Considering the fact that players of modern games aren't even considered to be human anymore.. you're marine animals. Fish.

Bruh that dont look like killing
---
Its SWF. 2 red ranks with 1-2 potatos.
---
my first ever game as a killer had a group of 4 survivors who were savvy enough to just constantly follow me around. Everytime I hooked someone, a survivor would try to swoop in the second i turned my back and it went like that over and over. Some even tried baiting me into attacking a healthy person to buy more time.
---
Game ended with one survivor death, it was awful. I was rank 20 and they were 12, 16, 10, 10
---
Daddy window
---
Yeah a mix of latency and design. They purposely made it so youll get hit through windows but if you feel like youre getting hit after youve already taken a step away from the window thats the latency.
---
It's not fully 50/50 it seems
---
Part of me wants to start dodging if someone doesn't ready up before 15 seconds, regardless if I'm Killer or Survivor.
---
I mean you don't know if you're ready. Wouldn't want you to be AFK when the game starts. I'll give you another 5 minutes in queue. 🙃
---
r/areyouokay

I have a weird memory, I remember shit that doesn't/shouldn't matter. Plus some names are so easy to temember, like "Toxic (Insert survivor name)"
---
I got mine from their Twitter page, it only has the DBD logo at the bottom. No text.
---
Looks like your in a kill your friends lobby
---
The original perk had no timer?
---
It was obsession and wiggle based. The information about it is still on the Fandom, I’ve never heard of a 2 minute timer and can’t find any info about it. 
---
All the Fandom says is that you had to wiggle to a certain percent, and that’s exactly how I remember it, not with a timer.
---
If you can, level up Myers and get Save The Best For Last. At 8 stacks, you'll be able to attack healthy survivors trying to distract you and be back into chasing very fast. Even at 4 stacks, it's still decent at shutting down plays like that.

Bloodwarden is unique since it's a perk that serves entirely to punish bad play and nothing else. If you get screwed by it it's entirely your fault.
---
Well maybe your teammates. But mostly yours.
---
Fuck that map. I dont think I've ever done well on that map as a killer. The corn is like the survivors 5th perk.
---
Hahaha I remember useless crap but it's normally crap about wildlife and never remember anything about myself that's important.
---
Idk man. I noticed that it got harder to rank up, but as long as you think ahead like you said, it’s really not hard for new players to rank up. Especially if they come from games that require the same level of thinking. So ranking up is easy, but retaining the same amount of game knowledge as experienced players is a different story, I think that’s why you’re getting players like that. The black marker that prevents a derank is pretty generous in what it asks for.
---
My biggest struggle was finding out what killers and perks did and getting used to it.
---
It's like you have ESPN or something...
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/by8tz1/an_alltime_classic/
---
Mate, how does that make me have "no skill or a strategic map mindset"? Totems get found easily so ofc I'm gonna trade the insta down for hiding my hex perk.
---
When killers call gen rushing toxic even tho it's their fault they cant put pressure on them. (Killer main here)
---
Monitor, spirit fury, enduring, then your choice for 4th perk. Infectious would be good to chain downs in tier 3 or pop/thrilling tremors for more gen pressure. I would definitely say spirit/enduring though since he is an m1 killer with no special speed for gen pressure nor can he really mind game too well. Monitor seems to be the meta with him but it really works super well with his mirror. Other than that build I would say maybe alternate or swap monitor for perhaps the perk from ghost face where your terror radius goes down with each obsession hook. I think it will have a better effect.
---
Let's be real, the meme is so old that the "Nea's not a killer" memes are just as bad.
---
Is he one of the free killers? I don't own any of the DLC yet.
---
Nah he’s in a public lobby it’s just a glitch that happens
---
it works well if you deliberately go down in a spot that's hard to get to a hook from. one time, I had a Jane do this with Boil Over by going down near the exit gate of The Game, between that van and the wall. she wiggled off, then ran back tot he same spot. 
---
Joke was on her though, because then I just let her bleed out while the other 3 and I farmed during the BP event. none tried to save her.
---
Ew, ugly perks
---
no worries! i read as much as i could from the AMA but it’s so damned long i probably missed it
---
Lmao get nae-naed
---
I’m ready for death
---
What rank are you
---
That was that one dumbass character that's in every slasher movie
---
True
---
In my opinion this game should prob just become free to play as if you look at it  logically it does do a lot of stuff that free to play games do and honestly could prob generate more money for the devs
---
survivour mains can't take a joke the movie &lt;3
---
I was once crawling/almost dead and another survivor motioned for me to come to them so they could heal me...
---
Killer noob
---
No she didnt
---
or they use a perk for totem detection to hunt it down.
---
Yea
---
I like using those
---
I'm glad the worked on killer terror radius not being as bad if they're on the top floor. It's still doo doo though
---
bruh 100
---
I really like the idea, but I just have one question, how would chasing a survivor out of the basement work? Like if the survivor entered through one entrance and the killer entered from the other, would chasing the survivor out of the basement not be impossible because you would come out of different entrances? Or am I missing something here?
---
If they are toxic by t bagging or something it’s not reportable
---
bubba's so small 😂
---
When you’ve got time
---
its one of my favourites what !?
---
*you're right, how dare I use the items I get that are in the game.*
---
Feng vs the newest killer, E.T. on the Atari.
---
\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^
---
That's just the timeframe from when I hopped on to when I ran out of Mori's.
---
If you think this is sexual i can only assume you don't know what actual sex is.
---
woooh. u so bad ass master. teach us your flawless mindset in a youtube video plz.
---
yeah terror radius sucks and spinechill doesnt work great on it. other than that i actually love this map. i think it being confusing is great cause i know the map very well and a lot of killers dont. i know all the loops
---
So did you
---
id literally quit the game
---
ONCE MORE FOR THE FOLKS IN THE BACK:
---
DO. NOT. UNHOOK. ME. IF. THE. FUCKING. KILLER. IS. RIGHT. BEHIND. YOU!
---
i mean i understand why they did
---
I thank your wife for sharing my meme. I used to have a meme page on IG and did my OC there. But I got shadow banned and it just got stuck at 1k followers.
---
let urself die on hook
---
No, he isn't. The free killers are Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse, Huntress, Hag (Console), Doctor (Console).
---
That's what I thought because somebody with 2 hours in DBD would have maybe  1 green mori or no moris at all
---
Me too man I miss the old level 1 devour hope. Didn't use ruin so they wouldn't look for my totem.
---
.....*sigh* what
---
They cleansed her devour hope
---
while she did sit on my slugged body till I bled out
---
what is sandbagging :(
---
IF YOU PLAY SWF AND USE VOICE COMMS 
---
GO PLAY ANOTHER FUCKING GAME YOU SACKS OF SHIT! MARTH ALREADY PROVED YOU CAN CURBSTOMP EVERY KILLER AT ANY RANK USING VOICE COMMS!
---
YOU'RE NOT GOOD, YOU'RE NOT PRO YOU'RE FUCKING SCUMBAGS WHO GET THEIR ROCKS OFF SHITTING ON THE KILLERS! BHVR HAS DESIGNED THE GAME TO BE MASSIVELY IN THE FAVOR OF SURVIVORS ON EVERY MAP BUT THE GAME!  
---
AND SURVIVORS HATE THE GAME BECAUSE IT'S AN ACTUALLY  BALANCED MAP. IT'S SMALL BUT HAS A SHITTON OF PALLETS EVERYWHERE SO YOU CAN'T JUST RUN THE KILLER 6 LIGHTYEARS FROM THE GENS YOUR BUDDIES ARE WORKING ON AND LOOP THEM FOR 9 YEARS WITHOUT REPERCUSSION!
---
you're not husband anymore
---
I just tested the Chili in KYF. There actually is a difference but I could not perceive any difference when using the chainsaw while running, it's as if there's some bug in the coding making the "Ramp up" to max speed hard-coded and unaffected by the Chili. This is also with top speed addon (Beast Marks) which should make the "Acceleration" more noticable. (I was running Award Winning Chili with Beast's Mark)
---
However when from a stand-still, and waiting until the tail-end of the charge to actually start moving, it felt MUCH more responsive and I'd go from standing still to moving at near full-speed as soon as I pressed the button.
---
No idea if it actually is bugged (Because you still seem to have normal acceleration when using the chainsaw in a chase) but the "Acceleration" seems to only affect from standing still to how fast it takes for you to build up to your "Correct" speed at the time in the chainsaw charge. 
---
I.E. you don't technically hit top speed any faster when charging while moving, but if you change directions with WASD or start moving near the end you don't feel as sluggish. You can do something like chainsaw while a survivor waits on the other end of a pallet, stand still the first few swings like you're going to "Abort" the charge, then suddenly rocket forward to surprise them near the tail end. You go from standing still to whatever speed you should be going at according to the speed "Ramp up" in the ongoing chainsaw charge pretty much instantly.
---
I still think it's pretty useless and should be affecting how *fast* you reach top speed in the charge. If it does, it definitely isn't doing it enough. Or like I said make it increase chainsaw frenzy duration or how fast Bubba moves when you're holding the chainsaw and revving up. Or something else entirely.
---
Dev's did say after Nurse and Doctor they plan to look at Pig, Chainsaw Bros (So Billy and Leatherface) and Legion. 
---
I'm hoping they get more creative with Leatherface and completely re-do 90% of his addons rather than just adjust the Billy Hand-Me-Downs for both. Billy's likely gonna lose insta-saw which is a bummer although it's pretty cheesy. I'm just hoping they also add unique ultra-rares too.
---
She is just using her power, before you complain learn the game. smh my head.
---
Quetzalcoatl relates to serpents (snakes for short). I chose a ninja themed design with a snakes colour vibe (green). I took the idea that snakes slither around almost hidden and then lash out for the kill. That’s why I used a ninja theme as they are sneaky.
---
I guess it could be a Legion skin if it wanted to and I wouldn’t mind.
---
Epic perks, good job. I wish I could buy her
---
Oooo that's mean lol.
---
Are you under the impression that genitals are located on the back of the knee? Or did you think they were on the shoulder?
---
People that are too impatient to wait 60 seconds aren't the type of survivors you want on your team
---
imean he never said he made the format :/ he did make the meme..
---
Could it please be a part of GF buff with the part where they reduce his power's cooldown by 10 seconds and make his addons viable (at the moment only cooldown addons are viable)
---
I run Monitor, Sloppy, BbQ and ruin
---
Okay that was the original decisive strike, then BhVR was in the process of reworking it because people were having issues with it being abused or for toxic use. So during the rework process of DS they had a 2 minute timer running after you were unhooked, just like we have now but is 60 seconds or a minute, then just before the PTB “player test build” they changed the reworked DS from 120 second timer to a 60 second timer and BhVR interactive states this on a developer stream just before the PTB went live and explaining everything about the DS rework, if you take the time to go thru the videos you will hear them talking about all this. It’s real and it’s in the devs stream.
---
Thanks for asking!
---
Sandbagging is when you block other survivors on purpose in order to ruin their experience.
---
nah i definitely dont like being camped. if i lose fairly oh well, if the killers shit enough theyll take a depip for their one kill and i dont get to actually play the game im gonma be pissed. it shouldnt be bannable but there needs to be ways to make it stop, like if your hook didnt regress while killer was within a radius or something
---
yeah like I maybe have 50-100 hrs and I'm getting matched with people who have an extra 0 on the end of their hours. the most rewarding thing is catching those "hot shit" guys when they make a mistake.
---
Michael popped tier 3 way to early
---
Just headbutt some bitches.
---
Then what’s the advantage at keeping it low level? I’m a bit confused here.
---
All i lost was my purple fog bottle
---
Hahahahaha yeah, this was green rank so yur
---
Dude this is awesome! Try drawing Ghostface next.
---
Wow nice dead hard
---
It's the closest the killers have to expression really.
---
But turns out he's running unbreakable instead.
---
tell me why im rank 3 and i was camped by a baby doctor  🤦‍♀️ who i also looped the ENTIRE game and got hooked ONCE. 4 gens done while  and i had done the other one before he chased me. this dude thinks you can just escape easily like first of all someone wasted the god pallet so i couldnt loop killer shack and second of all he acts like bloodlust 3 isnt a thing??? "if youre so bad you go down" bitch i- ??? THEY GET SO MUCH FASTER WHAT CAN YOU DO??
---
They always are lol
---
My favorite moments of the game are always going to be trying to communicate with others, especially when I'm in friendly killer mode.
---
Get all 4 ppl round the hatch, open it with a key, all jump out.
---
I had this happen recently. A Jane got hooked on the hill and I got called a camper. Problem was, the hill was right beside a gen on ground level and both of those were in a straight line from the two other remaining generators. I sent him a screenshot from the farthest generator that clearly showed the 3 gens and his hook and asked what the fuck I was supposed to do - wander to the far side of the map?
---
Like what do these whiny survivors expect you to do when they do this? Got called a game-stalling camper while doing a Clown daily recently, as well. Same thing. Final 3 gens were in a row and I kept huckin' potions at 'em. Got multiple PMs whining about me stalling the match. Ain't my fault you have no gen awareness, my dude. That's on you, not me. I didn't line 'em up. I didn't plan for it to happen either time, it just worked out in my favor.
---
Since when Wraith became Jokey from Left 4 Dead?
---
dont even get me started on rank reset either. you get put back down into the camping ranks. good survivors get camping killers and new players who dont know what a skill check is and new rank 20 survivors get people who used to be like a rank 7 killer who they dont know how to counter. games literally trash
---
My ingame name is teabag at exit
---
I'm pretty sure survivors can still see the aura of a killer with insidious
---
???
---
If you say that you shouldn't pay attention to people that come to save a hooked person, then you completely lost me here.
---
Thanks man &lt;3
---
You also have to do all gens before doing this
---
FUCK YOU BHVR YOU ALWAYS PUT THE SHITTIEST PERKS IN THE SHRINE LIKE WHO TF WANTS FLIP FLOP OR ANY OF THE OTHER SHIT PERKS PUT BBQ NURSES DSTRIKE OR ANY GOOD PERK IN THERE
---
Do all gens, must have a key.
---
atleast one survivor bring a purple or a red key item.   
---
fix all 5 gen to make the hatch spawn.  find it. use key and within 20-30 sec all four survi jump out.
---
go destroy gens? find others? if you sit and wait for someone to get unhooked so you can tunnel them youre actually garbage at the game sorry :/ camping makes the game super unfun for survivor but justify it ig
---
This can't be true.
---
What? Why search if you already know that someone is coming?
---
My bad I forgot to add that part.
---
Clearly. I thought it was the mobile version until I saw the input prompt.
---
BECAUSE tunneling and rehooking the weak one is trash??? find someone else. if youre not a rank 20 killer you shouldnt have a hard time getting another down while theyre hooked. only time you should wait is if its the last dude alive and you still shouldnt tunnel. they didnt unhook this guy cause they knew she was camping him
---
Thank you, I’m currently working on the Wraith, but I promise Ghost Face will be after the cloaked man :)
---
NINE NINE!!
---
1.if your child actually drew this, a 9 year old painting a picture of two women from a rated M for MATURE game having a not very family friendly kissing session with Nea bringing up megs leg in a obviously sexual way let me ask you this. How would they know about these characters unless they have played the game a 9 year old should not be playing, your child obviously seems to have some sexual feelings towards something and that should not be happening to A 9 YEAR OLD, and why are you not seeing if anything is wrong with your child?! 2.69 comments...I’m sorry I had to do it
---
Yep. It does sound different now and I think the laugh is when she starts a chase? I’m not completely sure tbh.
---
But isnt this difference the problem?  Cosmetics outfits for existing characters DONT enhance actual gameplay, and the artists making these cosmetics that dont enhance gameplay are distracted from making new killer concept art or adding better art in chapters that do enhance gameplay and that I DO pay for every chapter.
---
When I bought into this game it was advertised as "We do lots of community events where you can earn all the cosmetics by partisipating in these events and visiting us!"  An now its "We have lights on our hooks and trash cans and heres some more whale bait"
---
It would be different if they said something like "We've hired three new artists exclusively to put out more cosmetics out to you in the cash shop and it wont detract from the game, events or community milestone rewards that we have been known for and you have come to expect."
---
The best part is that they think camping is a reportable offense.
---
Oh yeah my bad, forgot about Rule #412,096.
---
Well instadowns can get countered but Instaheals you need Franklin's to counter it and that's a teachable meaning you need LF and need to lvl him to lvl 40 which some people don't as they just want BBQ.   So yeah Instaheals are bullshit as they make the chase even longer or denying a hook while instadowns are countered by,destroying all the dull totems,devour hope(barely run at all), denying Ghostface his stalk which is easy and Myers his stalk and he also needs to reach tier 3 so it is like getting into a Chase and winning it if he hits T3(and LF and Hillbillies but those are so easy to countered if you just stick to walls)
---
doubt it was me then, i'm in the purple ranks
---
Myers simply because it's so unnecessary.
---
So every other trolling tactic gets punished but farming? Just because it makes it easier on you?
---
Noice
---
1.She has played the game, she's good at it too. In a world where music videos, lyrics, games and films glamorise sex and violence, the content in dbd in comparison is nothing imo. I'd actually prefer her playing this as she's not voice chatting with strangers and is playing as a team. 2. There is nothing wrong with my child, this is just a drawing by a kid with a big imagination, who in her words 'shipped' Meg and Nea.
---
oh my god i love killer main’s mental gymnastics
---
Ima Kate main too &lt;3
---
Can’t give it out, nor do I remember
---
they really need something like okay on roblox they have like a shitty rip off dbd but if you get "hooked" and the killer stands close your time doesnt go down and the person who saved you is slower so you have time to get out. they need something like this. personally i think borrowed time shouldnt be a thing, i think if you get unhooked while the killer is in a certain radius you should just get the borrowed time effect. i shouldnt have to hope to god my teamates have borrowed when you know damn well they wont bevause its a broken perk and doesnt work half the time anyways. but even if they add this, people will find loopholes. theyll camp at a certain distance so it doesnt give you it and then tunnel. THATS when it should be bannable because its an exploit. but theyll never add it anyways tho lol games hella killer biased thats why i dont play much survivor anymore
---
Another T_D poster lmao.
---
good think rank isnt a thing yet in mobile.
---
This is just way too op. Whose actually going to want to try and kill Clem????
---
Your flair... My flair... There is only room for one of us!
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one getting this glitch
---
Doesn't matter if you camp or not, they'll call you a camper in the chat no matter what.
---
Ah I see even if this isn’t true I’m not going to judge how you parent your child and your reasoning does make some sense when you think about it
---
how about alert or borrowed time
---
*Oink*
---
That’s the joke
---
Survivors are just trash who cant bare to use there brain and think about why these arent the same thing.
---
If it's obviously farming, like chasing you around, unhooking you immediately, and I hook you again, and he unhooks you staring at me. I'll go after him and not even touch you for the rest of the game. But other killers won't give a shit.
---
Perk is available for single lobby’s only
---
you got me there
---
Haha funne meem
---
Don't know I thought at first read through that it was for him but as far as i know his aura is still visible. Sounds almost like statuses a camouflage killer. How cool would it be if this is for a predator DLC. You can camouflage and have a detection range that if a survivor enters it they get the second status effect. Maybe give him a dash attack like pig or allow him to make an initial attack in stealth
---
ok
---
looks like he didnt skip arm day
---
Faced a team of Pizza dwights. Hooked one on basement and they  all came to rescue him and all stayed in the area.
---
Later, they 3 gen themselves. Same guy gets hooked, and they all swarmed him. Got called camping and tunneling.
---
Did you really go through my post history for that?  You are a very sad person.
---
I know it it looks like it should be a part of insidious
---
I don’t think there is 60 FPS only thing I’ve heard of was it being at 30 FPS
---
Since the release of the pro and X, i guess.
---
Im A rAnK 1 KiLlEr AnD I wAnT aDrEnAlInE nErFeD
---
Don't play legion and ghostface. They both are garbage and useless killers. Get cannibal to lvl 40 in order to unlock BBQ &amp;chili as teachable perk and switch to billy/spirit. They will be hard to play in first dozens of games, but soon you'll master them and will have no problems with winning or farming.
---
bruh ps4 and PC players getting all this killers free while in mobile wraith and jake arent even free
---
just sayin he might be me before i got better internet
---
I'm rank 9-10 killer. People still perform unsafe hooks all the time. You'd think people would realise that shit only gets people killed, but it happens frequently.
---
So, I make it a point to punish stupidity
---
I love them. The Meg 4head had me in stitches "but what does it do?!"
---
Happened to me once and when I was unhooked I still had the killers perspective so I had to get out by looking where I am from the killers perspective, everyone got pissed at me in the chat even after I explained the glitch, they were pretty pissed
---
It's on the first page highlighted by the nice big "Quarantined". Nice try pretending to be an impartial party in the discussion though. Have a good one, cultist.
---
It works well with killers that have lots of map presence. I've had success with hag.
---
Having the name Giovanni, the meme is not ruined. I approve
---
Losing the match because I lost one chase is what I hate about camping.
---
Yeah exactly
---
Abusing his one and only power. What will these type of people complain about next..
---
Dead by daylight news: Hillbilly is being removed from the game for using his ability. in the other news nurse is getting a buf-
---
Don't diss the Summer BBQ event, it was amazing!
---
Survivor insta heal: pressing 2 buttons with 0 effort.
---
Killer insta downs: stalking. Stalking a lot. Giving a window to juke/use nearest pallet/window (chainsaw), git gud at throwing hatchets. Git gud at direct hitting with bottles. Wait 5 gens and hope your totem isn't broken. Hope they break the right totem. Get 3 unhooks while 24 m. away from hook and hope your totem isn't fucked. Be in 32m. from the hook and find the exposed person in 60 seconds. Find obsession in the end of the game. Puke on them and hope to hit them before they stun you with pallet (plague braking survivors probably counts as instadown, idk). That's more than just fucking around and pressing 2 buttons, isn't it?
---
Ghostface is the best killler to play as if you are looking to have fun. He has good set of perks and overall is very fun and challenging at times.
---
Legion is considered to be a trash but a toxic/op killer if placed in the right hands. People will dc left and right and you want have any fun at all.
---
If you want to sweat and at the same time have fun, use wraith and or hag. They are also really fun but can be challenging against good teams.
---
Moris arent balanced, and the only recourse survivors have against them is dc'ing. 
---
Your frustration at not getting to use them and wasting BP spent is exactly how survivors feel when they see a mori offering. They spent BP on their items and offerings too. If you're going to deny them their stuff and fair game by bringing a mori, do you expect them to not react in a similar manner?
---
I try to let that baby dwight go but they never ever understand me hitting the generator while they are on my back. (Before hatch update)
---
Dude if you play Nurse on mobile I feel like you just deserve to lose at that point...
---
Yeah was the same for me. I didn’t escape though, ended up getting tunnelled and trying to get away from the killer while spectating the killer was rather difficult.
---
Hes new man, cut him some slack. He literally has 2 hours in the game
---
Stai zitto
---
I think extra blinks is fine, maybe not 5 because that does seems like a lot, but I agree with the longer fatigue would help. 
---
I think a way to nerf more blinks would be having it so with each blink you gain more fatigue time (not sure if it does that now or not).
---
I personally really like red rank as survivor and everyone just plays hillbilly(mostly) and since hillbilly is very easy to loop I usually loop them for awhile because they get greedy with chainsaw and don't M1.
---
That doesn't really help, neither character is reaching for anything.
---
I also tend to call t-bagging butt dancing
---
shut up, stupid science bitch
---
dont see anyone with the name boneless
---
I agree, I feel like that's why you never see Wraith in high ranks anymore, even Hag tbh. Some killers are insanely underpowered in high ranks and others are basically the only ones you can play.
---
It is a decent cooldown for a power that cannot be denied by looking at killer
---
Kinda sums it up.
---
Jigsaw is good for slowing down the game as long as you apply pressure to the survivors and keep them from gens and from getting traps off their heads, leatherface is pretty hated and mostly known for basement insidious face camps so if that’s your play style then that’s all you and Freddy is pretty good since the rework, probably the best out of all of the dlcs that you listed
---
Leatherface has good perks but pretty eh, pig has been getting nerfed recently so just don't touch it I'd say freddy because he has some solid perks, Add-ons and is fun to play
---
Jigsaw’s view of everything
---
It says infinite planes, not infinite realities. The two are different.
---
If they aren't asleep (they'll be glowing blue if they are), snares don't affect them.
---
Because she made a drawing. Right.
---
Ok, your school should really have thought you this, but drawing doesn't make you pregnant.
---
So what about the scream guy?
---
It looks like an immersed build so urban evasion
---
at least nicotine is mango flavored
---
I agree with everything except the Freddy's perks statement.. Blood Warden is situational and Fire up is alright, I haven't seen use if his third perk in so long I forgot it so I mean, That is just my stance on it tho.
---
Gave me PTSD
---
Ehm you really made that post to show us that you are rank 1? Ok. Congrats I guess...
---
exactly
---
I can’t stand mori’s. Keys either. I’m fine with instaheals, but I hate items and offerings that cut the game short in a cheap way.
---
I use the cord that comes with the xbox one. I prefer the xbox one controller over the Playstation one. Just plug it in and windows will automatically detect it. Set your steam preference for controller and you're good to go.
---
I'm feeling kinda opposite tbh, Old Freddy was what got me the Rank 1 Achievement, and I just haven't adapted to new-Freddy yet because muscle memory is a royal pain.  I can definitely see it from your perspective though.
---
Imagine being so obsessed with sex that you get triggered by a drawing by a nine year old.
---
But sure, it's the other people who are fucked.
---
Remember me is the perk you're talking about and it slows down the exit gates opening by 15 seconds it isn't great but it isn't bad either also blood Warden may be situational but it's pretty good
---
Sorry baked as a cucumber should of put a link in. Am new to this posting crack.
---
Its less effective in that it only really becomes useful mid-late game, while ruin places pressure from the very start, and by extending the early game the killer is typically in a better place.
---
The scream guy is pretty good if you use him correctly and have the right addons, it might take a while to get used to him but once you do it’ll have been worth it
---
Ghostface worst killer lmao 4k most games running chilli and murmers iron grasp and 1 perk of your choice
---
Your shit
---
Oh, well I haven't seen one in a while
---
Your comment was worthless 🤷‍♂️
---
That statement I have no quarrel with whatsoever
---
this probably wont come in the game because videogames cant kill minors in their game, nice concept though
---
Ah thats hot
---
The only part that made me die of laughter was when John Carpenter was following Michael with the keyboard. Other than that they are ok.
---
Note: This is my opinion. It is ok if you disagree.
---
He's meh. He is bad if you don't know how to play him but meh when you do and great if you mastered him but still ok not you're going to win alot even if you're great with him.
---
I saw this pipe in half
---
I main Quentin the most and his in game model, in my nicest words, is a disservice. I tried styling him more after the actor’s likeness but just a lil less baby fat on the cheeks since Quentin’s at least 21 in game. I also just like Jake so he’s there too, hope you guys like it!
---
No your shit
---
Great job!
---
jpxfrdx - you need to calm down
---
And the killer is using NOED, nurses, and whispers which are all meta perks as well. What's your point?
---
You’re quite the bore aren’t you
---
yeah i was DS'd twice and at the end a kate just ran by me and up to the gates to tbag bc she had BT
---
Use healing perks such as thanatophobia and sloppy butcher, use STBFL because it's easier for legion to hit multiple survivors, use the power not just for hitting but also to move faster between hook and gen, don't try to lunge in frenzy because a good survivor will try to 360 to kick you out, best add-ons are the duration add-ons and button.
---
Sorry my dude, new to the game series. With 200 less hours, didn't think to look at parodys, just reading all the complaints matched the video for me. Glad to help somehow.
---
TWICE? 
---
In the screenshot that you posted only ONE survivor is using DS. How were you ds'd twice?
---
L A U R I E    C H O D E
---
Haha yeah alright bud have a good one
---
The killer perks can be countered tho. Almost all survivor perks are just free benefits
---
Idk I went up against one last night that was nuts man
---
Does Sloppy butcher also make mending take longer?
---
I've less that 100 hours on the game too, I've enjoyed it a lot so far
---
Is that actually how it works though? Me and my friend were playing with two people that just got the game, and they happened to host the SWF and we were getting matched up with rank 14-16, closer to us.
---
MY DAD WORKS AT BHVR AND HE'S GONNA DELETE HILLBILLY
---
I didn't want to do it but they came down for my basement chest they went to far
---
Okay try opening your eyes then maybe that's the issue you're having
---
Both side has powerful items, thay's why they have rarity! If you use instaheals or keys, you can't blame the killer for using IH, or mori's, right?
---
I am
---
Well as someone that has played and gone against him he is just meh.
---
How did you get dsd twice when one survivor was running it?
---
So how about a ranking for the killers ehh? Or should I make another post for that? I have the axe thrower Myers scream guy and leatherface and I can buy others or will anyway but dont you need to play with em all anyway?
---
Must be just you then
---
I still got my BBQ from hooking him twice earlier so it didn't matter
---
Choose your own adventure.
---
Love all the shading you did. Looks really nice mate
---
Yeah, didn't think I would like it but I've split my time with killer and surviour so I get it from both sides. Just need them teachable perks unlocked haha.
---
Lol true I'll give ya that I am new to the game. Wish it was more popular I have waited forever for matches and it sucks
---
Can you open the hatch with the key while downed?
---
Omfg the meme build is so fucking godly lmao
---
D-strike
---
Please don't let r/dankmemes get ahold of this template
---
To be fair i only played old freddy by using offerings but something about new freddy makes survivors lose their minds, and speaking of muscle memory his fake pallet ability plays into their reliance on loops &amp; pallet stuns to survive
---
this looks really cool! Quentin is best boy
---
Glad I’m not the only console nurse getting bullied... I started playing nurse yesterday at rank 7, getting lobbied with 2’s and 3’s... not good.
---
I'd prefer if healthy survivors teabagging excessively in a chase would simply expose them for a bit. If they're gonna taunt they better be confident in their looping ability.
---
Maybe if they really, seriously did it super excessively the killer could have the option to forfeit 25% of their BP earned that match to Mori them.
---
I feel you I’ve been playing him a lot recently and it the window hop that gets me it’s not much quicker but you have such a small fov.
---
YEAH, THERE WAS A CLIP FLOATING AROUND ON HERE OF A GUY'S 9 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER PLAYING IT ON PS4 AND MY FRIEND PLAYS WITH A 11 YEAR OLD ON XBOX.
---
TAKING THE TERM BABY KILLER TO A LITERAL LEVEL.
---
See that's what was happening with me! I wanna play with the new killers I bought dammit lol
---
Try the build I use if you get him
---
ah yes the dont slug me build
---
I need this on a pin that is great omfg.
---
Freddy: *screams in paedophilia*
---
ty!!
---
This moment of the truly, inner understanding....
---
Can’t remember who’s channel I saw it on but someone suggested a totem perk that changes all totem’s to lit totems and that’d be pretty cool
---
will do whenever I unlock those perks XD I have almost nothing in terms of perks much less teachables my highest level is meg which is level 16 before I decided that the reason I got the game was more to play killer than survivor I see survivor as more of an extra way to play then the core mode in my eyes at least killer seems more fun but the wait times are also long even at rank 20
---
I subscribed to his channel years ago when I found some Clock Tower parodies they were fucking hilarious. He’s good at doing voices and his jokes are pretty well written. Definitely entertaining.
---
You guys don't get it . No mither is op !
---
Maybe not a hole character but a mummy skin to the plague?
---
coulrophobia isnt that bad though
---
I originally put pink clouds around jake to insinuate him getting attacked by the clown but it was too close to Quentin so I removed em but I also didn’t feel like making actual separate pictures soooooooo
---
Noice.
---
I’m pretty sure I wasn’t camping but yeah. To think that’s worth a report because a noob killed you multiple times is stupid.
---
Queuing as I read this
---
I couldn't think of anything else, and I don't even know what the perk does lol. I just heard No0b3 hating on it
---
I'll admit i've been abrasive, mostly due to all of the smug replies laced with insults or insinuations, so could i have been more patient? sure, but i think it's pretty understandable that i wasn't. 
---
Also to be fair, i didn't treat leaving a chase like it was some optimal choice, it's an unfortunate decision you have to make sometimes, but if the alternative is a bunch of gens being done, leave the chase of course.
---
and sure, rank 1 survivors will know where gens are and will get to them fast, but they still need to keep away from you and they still need to traverse the map. also, people do hide rank 1, it's less common, sure, but it's still valid because it saves you time not chasing and it wastes the killer's time by patrolling instead of chasing
---
I also never claimed people don't do gens while injured, i do it too, doesn't change that they're now just a 1 hit. and yes ik there are optimal and high coordinated survivor teams, yes ik it's not just SWF, and i've already conceded earlier that i don't think it'd be a bad idea to adjust gens somehow because having to rely on ruin or more makes builds a lot less interesting.
---
This whole pipping segment is pretty semantical, if you set your bar for winning as pipping then of course pipping is winning. If you don't play like an ass though, if you escape, you've most likely pipped unless you looped the killer the entire game, not giving you the chance to save or work on gens.
---
this comparison doesn't work at all, especially because i didn't claim to know what it's like to be these rank 1s and because being black isn't a learned skill, being rank 1 is. Literally all i have to do is listen to their advice on how to play and then see them follow through with it
---
I also never claimed there wasn't a big difference between purple and red and i honestly don't care of he would dismiss what i say just because of my rank, i expect him to know how to play the game, not how arguments work. you dismiss them by their creed, not by the person giving them, that's pretty basic stuff.  
---
I've still not seen a single rank 1 complain about gen rushing, i've seen plenty make fun of it, and it seems we agree that it's not a good idea to blame the survivors for doing the main objective. Your points, while sound, didn't actually go against what i've said. Everything you mentioned about the difficulties of killers is true, but that doesn't make "gen rushing" toxic or bad and it doesn't mean that it's not combatible, there are just a lot of difficulties. We honestly seem to agree, i think you mostly just took issue with my tone and saw that i was trying to explain basic mechanics of the game to people who i think aren't anywhere near red rank skill, but who you think may be rank 1 survivors
---
Oh ok. Thank you
---
Bruh pre patch MoM and decisive were get out of jail free cards. you can completely get rid of NOED tho. It is not at all on the scale of MoM and DS
---
I don’t camp anyone and in terms of tunnelling, if I’ve already put someone on a hook twice then why wouldn’t I finish them off? They’re all supposed to die anyway so someone has to go first. And who said I was mad? The point of my suggestion was to try and reduce the level of toxicity that survivors for whatever reason add to every game they play. Why not just keep it civil? It’s a game.
---
survivors in the killers terror radius have a 50% penalty to healing
---
Amazing with spirit and Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Eh, not that bad
---
Had a swf 4 team, the hooked got healed right under the hook. I come she doesn't run, it was my fault. 
---
1 guy got unhooked right after i hook him but instead of splitting he decided to stick to the other and annoy me. He borrowed time so i down him again, DS i down him again he dc. He waited until the game ended just to tell me how mean and terrible i am. 
---
So yeah if you dare to hook one have the decency to wait in the basement until the game is over. Staying at a hook when the gate is powered is wrong(got 2 for staying close instead 1) when one gen is left you can't stay close to the nearly finished it if the hooked is close. Trapping the shack is wrong and so on...
---
There should be a system that you can report people for saying annoying stupid shit so they can be matched against each other.
---
First survivor
---
* Lithe (3)
---
* Spine Chill (3)
---
* Borrowed Time (3)
---
* Self-Care (1)
---
Second survivor
---
* Prove Thyself (2)
---
* Self-Care (2)
---
* Autodidact (2)
---
* Decisive Strike (1)
---
Third survivor
---
* Adrenaline (1)
---
* Sprint Burst (1)
---
* Resilience (1)
---
* No 4th perk
---
Fourth Survivor
---
* Small Game (3)
---
* Dead Hard (3)
---
* Self-Care (3)
---
+ instant heal medkit.
---
They were "all" using meta perks you say?
---
I see that Spine Chill is activating. Killer is patrolling nearby. 
---
Spine Chill active he’s definitely coming for me, better stay on the gen until he’s on my ass.
---
It's guy love, that's all it is. There's nothing gay about it, in our eyes.
---
Beauty In The Beholder literally just does what Leader does but exclusively for healing.
---
Yes it is...literally the only thing that doesn't make it the stupidest most broken perk in the game is the fact that it can be prevented by cleansing all dulls.  Otherwise it's free a free instadown and haste to run them down as a reward for playing like shit and not knowing how to protect gens.  True said it best, it's a substitute for learning the game.  It isn't a big deal against swf they cleanse dulls and use each other as totem counters but soloqueue gamers will provide you your mindless no effort instadown every game.  The biggest crutch perk remaining in the game and it isn't even close.
---
Speaking of bill, today I had one match that was so ridiculous. I am a rank 10 and was matched with a bunch of terrible teammates. What happened was a bill unhooked me while being proxy camped by a spirit and he had no borrowed time, this caused me to immediately be hooked again (I was saved but had no second or third chance on a hook) and later that match a stupid level 19 claud brought the spirit right to me 🤦‍♂️
---
The bill didn't even have unbreakable either!
---
This killer did it because of the insta-heal, I suspect. I mean it's a part of the game, it's an item that can extend the chase, which it did. But the killer didn't have to take much time to chase the survivor to down them again. Imo it was her signaling her disappointment or gloating for kinda wasting the insta-heal.
---
Yea. First survivor had BT and SC both meta perks. Second survivor was using SC and DS both meta perks. Third had adrenaline. Fourth had BT, DH, and SC WITH an insta heal
---
Ok, I was just in mass confusion.
---
That's why I don't use moris or keys
---
That wouldn't be half bad, I kinda enjoyed being out the gate, but I think you would need to be able to fly around otherwise you probably won't see anything
---
Ya same
---
The fact that you're this worked up over someone constantly pressing the crouch button goes to show how mentally unstable you are. Anytime a survivor does that to me or BM's me, it has 0 effect. At the end of the day, it's psychological warfare. You're over here crying about it, meanwhile that survivor is thinking 'that killer's emotions were easy to control'.
---
I love it when survivors have high class bait skill. Fast Vault on the other side of the map let me rum there.
---
Pls never point where kuller is cuz we arent mind readers and we can get real confused
---
Self-care is a meta perk ?????
---
Do you consider Urban evasion a meta perk too?
---
He's a mentally unstable person. Don't worry about him.
---
So you’re free to complain about NOED but you don’t have to cleanse totems? Nani?
---
Newbs?
---
Oh I like this. Your HCA is brilliant, and I can tell you've been playing longer than I have. CJ is better too. I just wanted to throw some possible ideas out there, then allow the community to consider and and refine them. No complaints from me man you rocked this one. Really wish I had Ball Hog on my David King rn tbh 🤷‍♂️
---
Since when has self care NOT been a meta perk? Its a free heal. Urban is meh
---
I’m not mad but wow, you know what? This game literally does have the MOST toxic community I’ve ever come across. It’s like you, you personally, are made of vomit.
---
That’s a DePiP! :”(
---
At least they gave survivors a chance to play the game
---
That's usually my go to though too, but then end game lobby comes up and it says they're rank 6 or something. It's honestly shocking.
---
I like that style
---
Makes other hexes more viable and NoED less viable. Not sure who would be against this ha...
---
Then use a styptic you fucking brainlet
---
Then low tier killers will get curbstomped by god survivors with no chance to learn how to play the game. This is how camping becomes mainstream.
---
Oh god I read this thinking you meant someone’s mother
---
I imagine it’s because homeboy used an instaheal.
---
I would’ve given him a head nod as well.
---
It’s just amusing that people are bothered by head nods/shakes when teabags seem far more egregious.
---
First one kind seems just like lithe 2... I like it.
---
You fool, instead of killer you should have put entity, poor nea she cant catch a break
---
Fuckin crows.
---
Undetectable is probably the change to stealth killers where Spine Chill/Object of Obsession can't reveal them
---
Not sure about the other one though
---
It came once and knowing bhvr it wont be back so they can get more people to buy bubba.
---
Red Ranks are not filled with God Tier Survivors. I get a 6/10 chance to get a team who refuse to touch a generator until the Ruin totem is destroyed, while I’m distracting the killer in a chase to buy them time to do the objective they aren’t doing. You’ll get the one or two survivors who can keep generators being popped as well as keeping the killer occupied but it’s as rare as a Clown.
---
Wow....fuck you
---
Yeah that’s what I thought as well but the second one is weird maybe it has something to do with the new chapter?
---
I learned a lot about killer from Scottjund and a lot about survivor from Ussylis tbh
---
I didn't say word one about me not cleansing dulls I emphasises dulls and take out 2-4 per game.  I said randoms don't cleanse dulls and it's unreasonable for me to have to find all 5 myself every game and that's basically what it takes in soloqueue.  Randoms are potatoes throughout red ranks.
---
I run spine chill and if I'm ever on a gen with someone and spine chill lights up for 3 seconds I always point and run. Most of the time they dont get it and get slapped though
---
What is it meant to do here tbf, numerically the 8,9 and 11 more tgan average out the 2
---
NOED rewards you for protecting bones and applying enough pressure that survivors decided to Gen rush.
---
Adrenaline encourages survivors to Gen rush without doing bones because it's effects are only seen by finishing all 5 gens, thus it rewards survivors for failing to do all objectives.
---
See I can do this too.
---
I went there multiple times last night, and one game was Iri Gatekeeper/Gold Devout/Gold Malicious 4k and ZERO Chaser points just because of all the goddamn corn, so I got a safety pip
---
Why does this map exist
---
&gt;Perma Tier 3 gives the survivors no chance of escape. 
---
No necessarily true. Survivors dont heal against Legion or don't cleanse against Plague and that doesn't stop them from escaping, even though they are also 1 shot. The difference with being exposed the entire match is that people become too afraid to play normally and just urban evade around, which means gens take longer to progress if they even progress.
---
Matchmaking is broken. I want to play against and with red ranks, not with greens and purples.
---
When your name is Spongebilly Moripants and you don't hit ready
---
Wait time is too long not for this to happen.
---
Yknow I only ever see Michael mains saying how much better he is than ghostface, never the other way around
---
It's great when you're doing a slugging build
---
Oh a wraith main!  I d/c against you guys all the time!
---
I like to point attack plans for camper hook rescues. Claudette go left Ace go right. I'm going to go straight ahead and piss him off to pull him from the hook. Not that many get it.
---
Nea and the pussycats
---
I was also thinking it might be Dark Devotion (that one Plague obsession perk).
---
It's probably that though
---
&gt; MoM wasn't that bad. It just pissed off killers when you could take an extra hit. It was only one extra hit. It was a perk you had to activate throughout the whole game. And its not as if they get to choose when they take an extra hit. Killers overeacted way too much on this one and you are a perfect example..
---
You find a Survivor. Chase them for 20 seconds and hit them once (1). Chase them again for 20 seconds, hit them down (2). They get pulled off the hook with DS, you track them down and hit them a third time (3). You now have to either leave them on the floor for an entire minute or eat a 5 second stun.
---
They get picked up, you track them down again. Hit them for the MoM trigger (4). Track them down **again**, hit them to down them (5). Five hits, and you're not even on the second hook yet. Adrenaline kicks in, that's hit number (6) if you manage to down them. Six hits, and you maybe got your second hook in with that.
---
And all of this is assuming the survivor never got healed and wasn't packing any insta-heals. You could feasibly see a single survivor getting 7-8 hits before their second hook,  and the only way to counter it was to run the killers that do insta-downs or were bugged.
---
7-8 Hits for every survivor. For their second hook. If you think that "wasn't that bad", you clearly weren't playing Killer (or at the very least weren't playing anything other than Billy or Nurse) when MoM builds were popular. It was legitimately a nightmare for any M1 Killer, which is already the weakest Killer type in the game.
---
&gt; But killers complain way more than survivors. Survivors want diversity and new ways to play, new perks and ways to have fun.
---
No, no they don't.
---
Killers complain about:
---
- being t-bagged.
---
- Gen Rushing.
---
- bullshit perks (like MoM or one that I don't agree with needs changed, Adrenaline)
---
- Looping
---
- and finally, Flashlights.
---
Survivors, on the other hand.....
---
- Camping, even if you're on the same side of the map.
---
- NoED
---
- Mori
---
- Ruin
---
- Any Killer that kills them (even Myers isn't safe from being called OP)
---
- The fact that they can't have nice perks, despite the fact that they abuse the shit out of any perks their given (MoM) and don't understand that 4x a perk like MoM is ridiculous against a single Killer.
---
- add-ons that they don't like, even if those add-ons aren't good (Iridescent King for Doctor for instance, but mostly Prayer Beads (which is good))
---
- The Survivor Rulebook, where you must give the last survivor the hatch, you must not camp, you must not punish a survivor for doing anything, and you must not mindgame a pallet loop.
---
- Nurse
---
and so on.
---
&gt; You appear to be projecting things you see on this reddit into my opinion.
---
&gt; I couldn't care less about some rank 1 p3 claudette or some shit that is giving you a hard time. They are rank one and have spent a long time on the game - of course they are gonna own you.
---
I've never said I had an issue with Rank 1 P3 Claudettes. It's kind of funny that you interject that while saying **I'm** the one projecting.
---
If by the second time they don't get it, I just go for the hook to end the pain.
---
Are you okay? I literally said that, to find teabagging to be toxic and controlling your emotions, you have to be mentally unstable. Did I tell the OP anything awful? Did I swear at him? Insult him? Anything like that? No, I didn't. He's this worked up over someone teabagging, and he's on here complaining and insulting others. Yet, the person telling him that he's emotionally unstable is the bad guy? Grow up
---
Hey! So I haven't been playing DBD for a while and just came back for a few games. I'm not sure why, maybe because I've been thrown down into the low ranks, but I had really bad issues with people randomly insulting. In this case I just said a simple "gg" to the killer, which bothered them to bits, because one of them got camped. 
---
I'm not affected by these kind of words, I've got thick skin, but I'd have a little question. Could we get a bad words filter?
---
I noticed other games do have stuff like that, games like Apex just put happy \*\*\*\* or just some spacing instead of bad words. It makes me wonder if this is a difficult thing to implement, because people can literally use every bad word in the beginning and endchat. They said alot more that I would never screenshot, never repeat and never put into this subreddit. A bit of a filter would be awesome.
---
Cant he spam R
---
&gt; Just like most problems in DBD, players in general should git gud instead of having the devs meddling with perks / mechanics.
---
While I do agree with this 90% of the time, my god are some of the perks in dire need of help. On both sides.
---
Oh thank you. I missed that page.
---
Oh yees. This is the only reason I run spine chill in lower ranks. I can tell if the killer is beelining onto us and always try to alert the other survivor if I can. Works like a charm every 4 out of 10 times
---
Can we just make: point point follow double teabag mean "follow me to the hatch". It would still be simpler than come get me from the hook.
---
Well to be honest, that’s a tactic called dribbling at high ranks. It counters someone who has decisive strike, so maybe they think your trying to counter them or something?
---
I always point at the direction I know the killer is in.  I've found that this often accomplishes the opposite of my intentions.
---
Its photoshop, nothing to worry about
---
Then its not the perk thats the problem is it?
---
Pointing to the killer should be while crouched and involve a mouse left / right shake to indicate no. Even then its a high risk communication.
---
yikes man who pissed in your cereal
---
Why can't I draw like this?
---
*Yells and stares at hands*
---
Nothing you did the best you could they're just salty they played badly and need to take it out on someone new.
---
Is that the drop button on PC? I play on console.
---
If the killer drops you, it wastes time &amp; you could possibly wiggle out.
---
If you had the perk " Borrowed Time " you would def go to save them. Else you just escape. They'll call you a farmer since the killer will kill them the instant you unhook them and that'll also hurt your ranking system to have unsafe hook rescues. So yeah, don't worry it's just DBD, just say gg and go on to another match. :)
---
Jokes on you i never play Michael
---
Because it’s removed easily and forever by spending 10 seconds on a Totem?
---
It’s annoying, yeah but most people can work through it or at least hit the Great Skillchecks.
---
Devour Hope and Lullaby worked amazing for me. Cause with two lit totems and no ruin survivors assume it's haunted grounds and don't start cleansing till shit has hit the fan.
---
Oh whatevah.. it doesn't need a filter, if some cuss words bother you that much then don't play the game. I'd also recommend not using the internet then.
---
I think as a game and a platform you wouldn't want to support this\^. If there is place for improvement, things should improve. If nothing can be done about something (eg. you can't control voice), it's another story. But since other games somehow seem to think it's a right thing to ban certain words, DBD might think that way too. Afaik they handed out bans to people that asked others to commit suicide. Following your logic they shouldn't do that. And they shouldn't ban for insulting at all. I think you're wrong.  
---
If we ask everyone to turn off their Internet that ask for a decent behavior, there would be only these kind of people left.   
---
This topic is a suggestion to make the chat a better place and who wouldn't want that.
---
It's alright, I could have worded it better. Shitty day and all, just kinda of snap at people today. I'm sorry myself for being rude in my original comment
---
You got 27k points id hardly call that loss
---
Cough Cough Ochido
---
At the expense of killers having straight up no chance if the survivors know how the game worked...
---
I've seen 1-2 instaheals in bloodwebs from 40+ multiple times in a row without missing any bloodwebs, so they aren't actually that rare, around 50-60k BP for 1-2 instaheals.
---
I’m not going to stop playing with my friends just because they don’t play as much as me and aren’t as high of a rank. I’m Rank 6 because I play a couple hours every day and my friends I play with the most are Rank 12 and Rank 16. I get this can unbalance the game for the killer and make it less fun, but the solution isn’t ending SWF. 
---
I still think adding a casual mode is the best way to go. A game mode where your rank isn’t taken into consideration at all.
---
BHVR lets him get away with that? The horror!
---
"Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. Especially you. All the time."
---
Nice!
---
It would be nice if they added something like this, make it where all hook progress stops if the killer is within a 16 meter radius or just make it where the killer loses all blood points for camping. No they will never make Camping a bannable offense and the few things they have done to try and keep people from doing it dont work! It’s a laughingstock of what little they do to killers who camp, I tried it the other day just to see how bad they make it out to be for losing pips if you camp and I safety piped with a 3k and let the last one go thru the hatch, used a insidious basement bubba build. Made 40k and almost pipped and I camped the hole time. But yes it would be so nice if they really put the brakes on the camping nonsense this game is a big enough grind as it is. Survivor side sucks for points and killer side you get loaded but I go back and forth.
---
Just gotta get over it.  If they’re going to facecamp they’re going to do it regardless of your salt.  It sucks but it’s facts.  Don’t bother sending messages either cause you’re just giving them a laugh.
---
I don’t notice this happening in purple ranks, but remembered it happening more often when I was in green ranks. I think face camping is just a crutch that less skilled killers use. It’s a part of the game and shouldn’t be against the rules, but just isn’t needed at a higher skill level.
---
I’m not saying don’t play with your friend , they should join with a higher rank killer , low ranks get shit on when high 3/4 are red ranks and here in green
---
removed for uncivil
---
Do y’all think the shape or Ghostface is better?
---
They said something about it giving to much time and upon internal testing found it to op. But that’s with internal testing and not the real world and how people actually act. I can’t remember if they had the 120 second DS timer in the PTB I think it was only the 60 second timer and they changed it just before the PTB
---
Well, I disagree. A profanity filter wouldn't hurt,. It's nothing that bothers those that use the chat in a decent way, so why wouldn't we want or need it? 
---
You never have to listen to insults, neither in RL nor on the Internet. But you'll get banned from all the platforms that I know for these kind of (racial) slurs or insults. I mean, why? Those that are being insulted can just leave, right? Or just stop using the Internet.
---
As a low rank killer, I finally came across one of the best games I've ever had and I'm still not sure if they were letting me catch up to them or maybe I'm finally getting better at the game, but it was also my first instance of a poor looping and I was trying to outsmart him but it was at the preschool.
---
My boy Jake is super under-represented, glad to see him getting some love!

Absolutely and people need to understand it goes the other way too. Both sides of the game get pretty damn op I think sometimes things should be op. Like fuck it. Make everything op so we can all have fun.

Frankly I just stayed on a generator when I heard Old Freddy’s lullaby’s. Half the time I got a skill check to wake up during the eight hours he had to wait for you to fall asleep. The other half of the time I just waited until the last second and then sprint burst-baited a swing. Then looped him until he stopped chasing me because he had literally zero chase pressure

I wish the ranking system was balanced a little more. Like they should have 30 ranking levels maybe even 35 depending and should also consider how much they have played the game to  classify who plays with who. Like for example a rank 15 survivor with 300 hours played should not be matched with a rank 15 who has played for only 10 hours but that's just me 🤷‍♂️

I mean you did tunnel so yeah. You're wrong.

Boil Over is waaay better on console than it is on PC, IMO. 
---
Nice showing though for sure.
---
If I see the ping spike I'll wait the rest of the time to see if it was  just a fluke or a bad lobby.

L1. L2 to use stealth

wow didn’t realize you were in my game and no I didn’t survivors hear the heartbeat right when they get off the hook and love to yell “tunneling”

It's a Quentin teachable. He's part of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" DLC which you have to pay for

I don't think Myers should have those add-on for perma tier 3 or instant moris in tier 3. I kind of feel like ebony moris should be removed too. It just seems to weird to me that you can have an offering that lets you kill a survivor outright. You should have to work for a mori like get max devour hope or something like rancor.

Yeah I do this too, up to a point

Hey, it's not my fault red twine shows up all the time in the blood web!

ThAtS a JaCkDaW?

Oh my bad.

From one Jane main to the other, I'm sorry sweetie
---
This was before EGC right?
---
Yeah I like to stay rank 6 as a survivor. I play strong killers who make the game interesting but it also has variety and is chill
