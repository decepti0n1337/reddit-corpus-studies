Killer still takes a little bit. Maybe 10 minutes on a bad day, 1-2 minutes normally. Survivor is always 2-3 minutes and 5 minutes with a 3 stack.
---
---
---
Um.. there is no checkmark on selfcare
---
Ace actually smiles during all the mori's. Try getting mori'd by a doctor while playing ace (works best with the standard cap and glasses)
---

---
Good shit
---
Every single time!!
---
I wonder what he mains... 🥴
---
Dwight seducing nea
---
On console or pc? Im on ps4 and it takes a long time to get a swf match but like 30 sec for a killer game
---
Lol no
---
Then get devs to fix broken hex spawns and not have Survivors be able to spawn right in the proximity of one and have it cleansed immediately. It hinders the perk useless afterwards especially if your working on Devour Hope stacks.
---
The one that uses xD in 2019 is secretly the killer
---
Not bad for what you have. 
---
As others said, it can be useful to not rely on Self-Care. It takes a long time and encourages more independent play which can easily backfire. In higher ranks, it will hurt more than help you. 
---
Bond is my favorite perk for Survivors and in my opinion is worth it for the team heals, and all the map awareness it gives you. I can’t recommend it enough. 
---
I also see you have We’ll Make It. If you have BT and are looking to be altruistic, it’s very valuable and lasts for so long. Pair it with Empathy/Bond and you can easily get 1-3 heals out of it. Anytime I get unhooked by someone with WMI, I instantly think they’re a champion and will go out of my way to try to ensure their escape.
---
What we need is the creature from the black lagoon as a killer
---
Legions strength is to draw the game out a long tiime. No one wants to play a 30 min round that involves half the team mending in a corner at any given time. At high ranks I dont leave my gen against a legion who plans to frenzy hit me and runaway. Gen rush til I have to mend and then back to gen rushing. My advice and the legion I hate uses power to make a first hit before they cancel on top of you to make the down instead of frenzy hit and run away.
---
And if you use the logic from The Thing (2011) prequel, Childs isn't assimilated either because he still has his earring.
---
So Oni is Sans apparently.
---
This is true
---
Right
---
I hate the unhook 2 survivors during the end game collapse challenge.
---
Well, since he gets millions of dollars from microsoft to stream on mixer, he doesnt need the money from subs and donations that much anymore, so he is no longer forced to play the games that brings him the most money, he can just play what he enjoys the most or try new games.
---
On console. I played on Xbox. Plenty of survivors there.
---
well when you start comparing base vs. base then a killers job becomes even easier once you factor out DS and BT, hell a killer like Wraith benefits greatly from that since he's one of the best killers that can capitalize on sloppy saves. Not to mention tons of other variables taken out the equation(Dead Hard, toolboxes, fast heals, Balanced, etc.)
---
Also Wraith isn't getting a 0k every match, that's the thing. That's the whole thing I'm arguing about, EVERY killer isn't getting a 0k every single match, from what I've seen and experienced myself, even in the sweatiest matches a killer is capable of edging out at least a 2k, maybe it would be a black pip, but they aren't getting destroyed in every single red rank match ever.
---
CUTE
---
Ghostface is no billy, spirit, or nurse, but he’s absolutely on the higher end. I’d put him in the same box as freddy and a good huntress
---
bc the ruin nurse really deserves Corrupt right after
---
Uh... yeah? it's pretty popular
---
solo survivors are fucked yea in certain scenario
---
That movie was terrible and flopped. Don’t disrespect the masterpiece of the original by even mentioning that heap
---
YES
---
You deserve it for wasting shack like that
---
I see nothing wrong. The game is working as intended.
---
I can’t even get everyone infected. They run away before I can spray them enough and once I catch up and spray them enough, hit them, hook them, 2 or 3 gens are done. I don’t struggle like this with anyone else
---
When I pull a survivor off a gen with ghostface but my challenge was not accwpted *true story btw*
---
Clowns gas is only a 15% speed reduction which isn't terribly slow, and he also has no map pressure, tracking or stall potential. He is not good and is far outclassed by killers like huntress, Billy and nurse.
---
no
---
That would be broken, but also... so fucking boring. 
---
it would be the most lazy killer in the game. he would add nothing new.
---
It was fine. It wasn't terrible, wasn't great. BHVR should troll everyone by teasing The Thing, and give us the one from the '50s (the original).
---
It is
---
Yeah
---
Good point, I have a love-hate relationship with that though 'cause the traps don't arm themselves the way you originally placed them. There is often enough where they arm themselves again only to be misplaced just enough to where they won't trap anyone which sucks
---
Oh gosh. That’d be terrible
---
This happened to me so much I bound the alternate action key to one on my mouse and having both the working key as M1 and the action button on one hand gets me 9/10 great skill checks
---
I wouldn’t have if you didn’t post this so...
---
Because noob hasn’t been spring for a while but I agree otz is great
---
Yet you don't see survivors mending with legion with nurses.
---
Haha.
---
I guess it was pretty desirable since he had been gone so long
---
Platform: Xbox
---
I cannot get a custom game to work. We'll have 5 people all ready up, it'll go to the loading screen, and then boot everyone out saying "Host Unreachable". It literally doesn't matter who the host is or how many times we try.
---
It would only increase toxicity
---
Fair
---
For that challenge just slug two survivors and then open the gates yourself followed by a hook. Very easy on paper. Bring an endgame build and it’s not bad at all
---
High risk, high reward. No.
---
If you're having too much trouble with that just M1 them and down them if you think you can, it won't reset their infection and they'll just become broken later. A really good thing to do is use Corrupt and an addon that increases infection time on objects so you can vomit on gens and they either won't be able to do them or the infection countdown will start when they do. That also gives you the bonus of knowing when a gen has been touched.
---
Cursed image
---
Right, which means the perk balance is a mess, with things like DS being broken, but it'd be better to buff Survivors base options first since they lean heavily on the crutch of OP perks. Or it would be, if BHVR hadn't balanced around the presumption of Killers bringing addons, which makes things much harder to calibrate.
---
And remember we're dealing in averages, so what you're seeing is a split of Killers managing 1ks in sweaty games and 3/4ks in games featuring an early kill for any reason, or Killers just being sweatier than survs. Although even a few 0ks are happening, so it's not "at least" anything.
---
Lol exactly.
---
Are you also getting separated after matches?
---
Good answer go put your brain dead comments somewhere else
---
Hex perks are so powerful because they have that risk. The most they will do is give bonus bloodpoints if they are taken down very early or give you a tiny power like larger field of view, nothing substantial
---
So you want to reveal the killer at the start of the game because this shows what the survivors are using even since the killer can see the items in the lobby already?
---
Steve should get his nail bat.
---
If you’re being serious, it’s an eye, ear and finger lol
---
You got downvoted for laughing emojis...wtf
---
And you are blocked ;)
---

---
Resilience should increase wiggle though.

Too bad they never get banned.

---
he has one though
---
I just got corrected myself yesterday over at r/horror. I thought the same thing, and don’t blame you.
---
Did they say anything in the post-game chat.
---
Bullied
---
Sum like that :)
---
I'm fine with 95% of Hawkins but those catwalks man... that sensory deprivation tube is the worse designed thing in the entire game, the way you just slip and slide off it is so annoying as Killer.
---
Is it bad my first instinct thought it was either Jendenise or AngryPug?
---
Its always a 3 o clock skill check to add insult to injury
---
Yeah I know but when people talk fast when playing you don't really focus on enunciating the thh sound
---
One man working 80 seconds gens 2 man working 44 seconds
---
Keep unbreakable especially since Oni is a sluggering beast
---
I’d rather they just fixed the issue than just give us a potentially better band-aid
---
Oh ok
---
Lery's and Game too. You almost never find the totem early
---
Hey!  That was the Plague game where someone got stuck on a fountain right?
---
It can't get worse than it already is.
---
I dont know what rank you are or what your ambitions are whilst playing (for fun or ranking up etc)
---
Unbreakable- can be clutch and really satisfying to pull off but i personally wouldnt trigger it more than 1/40 games or so (consider swap)
---
dead hard is good (although i have been experiencing bugs with the perk lately)
---
second wind? is kinda meh, you should have no trouble getting healed by your teammates withouth losing too much time(consider swap)
---
borrowed is good but if you solo que(or duo) and are trying to rank up as fast as possible pick something else to help yourself stay alive (spine chill maybe) a good middlegorund perk between "selfish tryharding" and "im literally a saint and helping my team" could be we'll make it
---
Play killer dumbass
---
Dude, I just wanna day the stuff you’re doing is fantastic, and you’ve got some awesome ideas.
---
Not a perk that's his power
---
Or did he???
---
That's his power, when you see an orange glowing bar under your name, it means you need to mend before it goes down
---
Yeah definitely submit a ticket.
---
Same and now that this was pointed out I can’t see it again
---
Lmao are you aware 4k doesn't even make you pip
---
Why was Nea spazzing like that with the flashlight? Was it a perk you were running?
---
Honestly it's good to have a random spawn when a great spawn for things like ruin and DHcan leave you with 5 gens and no survivors. I understand that its frustrating but adding chance to a game is a good way to balance a game where you have something that heavily inconveniences survivors. Just the fact that things like ruin are not dependable are what keeps it from being a 100% pick rate perk. Which is good,bit promotes different play styles and stop survivors, especially at higher ranks from getting curb stomped whenever they try and play the game normally
---
Is crossplay actually out between all platforms?!
---
This mad lad actually got MoM to work.
---
She´s just PMSing as usual.
---
That’s the same with Clown for me, I have pop and bamboozle from the shrine and he’s not a good killer so I don’t want to buy him
---
Damnit
---
He literally has one
---
haha cocks
---
I do, and Ill have you know I go to the basement and stand still until 5 gens are done and then I open the gates for the survivors.
---
It's all consoles.
---
I told him he has to have all gens done to open gates as killer
---
You know what I mean though, don't you? Killers sometimes purposely move in a way to kinda taunt that they won. One time a killer had devour hope and I was the last person left alive, so I figured I rather die in a corner/go look for the totem rather than let them mori me lmao.
---
You can use verga multiple ways in spanish each with different meaning. And expression 
---
Ay la verga
---
Vete la verga 
---
Chupo mi verga
---
The issue being what exactly? Totem spawn locations?
---
you could also just be healthy instead of wasting two perk slots :\^)
---
She's just very hungry and upset and doing her best. I support her.
---
Also, not directed at you OP, but hoo boy, if someone used my art to jack off about how creepy mad people are, I'd be wicked pissed.
---
Thats alot of bloodpoints
---
r/DBDgonewild
---
So in this instance what did they mean?
---
🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
---
"I only 3k every game, please buff"
---
It's basically "prevent the endgame collapse from occuring via door opening."
---
What do you mean not good it sounds op. He hits you and someone has to heal you or u die. And he gets to see others around him.
---
If you completely ignore these stats that show you and the streamers your parrot are factually wrong about many things you say, I don't know what to tell you.
---
If you want death wished upon your whole family or to be called all the names in the book you can think of is "cool" then you would love the chat after a match. This game is beyond toxic.
---
Looks awesome!
---
double BP would be great on the first or second weekend after a new chapter comes out, so people can get faster perks + prestige skins.
---
faster perks: easier to compete against all the fullbuild opponents.
---
I've been that Nea. I got a bit too cocky with the flashlight and Legion downed me the exact way. No hard feelings though I deserved it. 
---
I didn't realise how toxic survivors could be until I started learning nurse.
---
The whole Shattered Bloodline chapter needs more attention. Right now, if you don’t want some variation of Spirit’s original skimpy ribbons, your choices are one of two gowns or one of three schoolgirl outfits.
---
Depending on his rank selfcare might be worth it :D
---
/u/vredditdownloader
---
Similarly
---
1. Killer mains complaining about the same perks being used every single time
---
2. Killer mains when they nerf another survivors perk forcing everyone back into the meta.
---
Or a different 2. Killer mains when survivors get blanket nerfs all around time and time again for years, killers are statistically shown to perform well, and indoor maps are shown to be killer sided. But you also have to put a blindfold on the guy, cause this thread alone proves these people would rather ignore what they see and say some stupid shit like "well face value blah blah" than understand what they're being told by these statistics. Some of us understand very well how to interpret statistics and apply them to what we see in game. Some of us utilize information like this for a living.
---
You can mend yourself, it only shows people in his terror radius, he can only hit someone once while in it, theres a 4 second fatigue after exiting it, and anytime he hits someone normally he loses 25% of it trust me its only good at rank 20-13 if the killer knows how to play which is unlikely.
---
Hope this piece of shit get banned
---
Okay so you are trolling
---
He's over expressing that he doesn't understand you. Example is him like: Bro I dont understand you, come on I dont know english
---
Thanks for the help, hypocrite.
---
Ok I see. Whick killers I guess are hard to beat like top 3
---
You just jinxed us.
---
You're welcome, waste of my time
---
You got hit through the wall. Get BHVR’d son

Yes
---
I bought Quentin the moment the tweet about the face rework happened. I feel so cheated...
---
idk too much about that it's good for the first few brown ranks, but it's much better to learn to not be dependent on self-care. once you've gotten a bit better at the game, you can go back to it and learn when to use it. in my personal experience, it's a situational perk. you don't want to spend the entire match healing. if there's a killer that doesn't want to break a safe pallet, I'd say go ahead and start healing lol
---
Trickshot
---
Shouldn’t have posted this if you didn’t wanna waste time responding to a comment that only exists because you felt the need to put a mede
---
He doesn't have bond when he took the screenshot
---
Quieres chupo mi verga por favor
---
What?
---
Just a reminder if you're a survivor and you do this, even if you get away, you are less than trash.
---
I’d put Iron Will instead of Second Wind, but it’s your choice. If you are confident with this build, go for it.
---
It could still work.
---
When the perk was new and I wasn't too good at countering, I would consistently disrespect the stun and try to grab them out. I consistently believed I could beat them to the trigger.
---
More often than not I was wrong, obviously.
---
Ok first you equip spirit
---
I know what you mean. But I don’t think it’s a good idea to run around injured when you know nothing about the game.
---
I relied on selfcare for way too long. So I can see why you shouldn’t get used to it.
---
That’s pretty funny not gonna lie. And no not in an insult way, but in a genuine “well, that’s pretty funny, actually” way. I mean, I guess you take pleasure in my responses then, also considering them funny?
---
Back to this... whatever it is, ya know you can just block me, right? Tell you what, if you send another comment instead of blocking me, I’ll block you to shut us both up period so neither of us have reason to keep going at eachother, mainly because this is going no where and I won’t ever back down until responding literally does nothing, like me blocking you or you blocking me. Sound good?
---
Plus Inner Strength is very good.
---
Bring the killer to them. Get rid of those survivors asap lol
---
baby nurse
---
I thought that was intentional
---
For Cripple Them All you actually have to grap survivors off the traps. The description is quite misleading.
---
For Escape Artist you actually have to escape the hook and the trial.
---
Medic and Handyman are known issues. For some reason the game doesn't give progress for the trophies and same goes for Wounded Healer. Hope they fix them soon!
---
For From The Void She Kills I believe they will rework the trophy in the future to make it attainable again. Like they did with Relentless Pursuit to make it more easier.
---
I myself have the platinun trophy and 100% from both lists so I know some of them can be a real bitch.
---
Use whatever you feel comfortable. If having self care makes you comfortable, use it. Because if you are comfortable you’ll be more efficient as well. But if I was you, I would put alert instead of self care. Also kindred would be a good candidate for self care since it is getting buff with the next patch.

Xbox One
---
Gameplay issues
---
Cannot play with a friend. We invite each other to parties, but half the times I can see them but they can't see me. When it does work and we try to find a match, we end up in completely separate lobbies. Sometimes, when both show in the "party," one will say "looking for match" and the other won't say anything, even though both people are ready.
---
Anyone find a fix for this?
---
Darn
---
Fuckin nyooooom.
---
it really looks like they just ripped the files from DBD and imported them in the Sims for some of these and the end result was nightmare fuel.
---
I dont block people but you can do it
---
in one game there is 4 survivors and 1 killer.
---
Snikch’s get stitches. Full send that fucker. HES NOT PART OF THE PLAN
---
yes a 0k is entirely possible, unless you're advocating to give even the worst performing players a mercy kill as a sort of participation trophy? At the end of the day these are all just  players and the performance does vary, I know there are games that are a a hard domination all the way through, but if it isn't the norm then it shouldn't be considered as the "baseline". If there are enough players out there getting 3-4 kills as a killer to drastically outweigh the ones getting 0-1 statistically then that just says that newer players will probably lose more, but still have the potential to get kills with said killer once they improve themselves.
---
If the killer is completely incapable of EVER killing a survivor even in regular circumstances, then maybe we'll have a case of the killer being completely unable to compete, but even the worst performing killers are statistically shown to be performing above average. Arguably the only killer that came close to that was old Freddy since there were many scenarios where he couldn't physically do anything to survivors simply due to how his sleeping mechanic worked, and rightfully so he was basically living in his own section of tier lists until he got reworked. The next closest killer would be Nurse simply because of her learning curve, as in you won't physically be able to baseline catch a survivor ever if you don't know how to use her power, this is made up with the fact that her power is arguably the deadliest in the game and can basically guarantee wins if you're good enough with her.
---
I don't personally see a game as balanced if you can always effortlessly get those 3-4ks. Moreso if you are able to compete for them, which any killer is able to; even Wraith, Doctor, Legion, Clown, and Bubba with the right builds. This brings me back to my older point of, sure some killers have an easier time than others but not much can be done with that unless you completely change the goal posts and buff/nerf numerous things, which I will agree can be done and I believe BHVR is doing, so I don't see the problem there. My main point is that it's kinda farfetched to just assume 2/3rds of the killer cast shouldn't even try in red ranks when they are statistically showing that these killers are performing well in red ranks.
---
You did nothing wrong, in fact what they did (teaming) is bannable. It's happened to me before.
---
Same here.
---
sure mr
---
Ew someone who judges others.
---
Sounds good. See you never I hope.
---
It would be even more hilarious when you find out you can escape and not pip. Like WOW, it's almost as if pipping is based on 4 different categories and not just a black and white system.
---
No
---
He said he didnt understand anything you said
---
I dont think so bc when my bro was playing dbd he was going against the demogorgon when he teleported behind my bro he had spine chill but bc he had the undectectable statis effect so it didnt work
---
This same mentality, except as a Killer. In the beginning, I'd try to 4k but would give the last survivor the hatch almost every match. Made it to rank 12 or so, then started getting TONS of toxic survivors that teabagged after every pallet whether they stunned me or not, clicking flashlights behind windows, the works.
---
I started getting frustrated after multiple marches with no kills and I had a conversation with my friend. He told me he barely plays Killer but when he does, he doesn't try to kill survivors. He just messes around with Ghostface, popping up from behind corners and teabagging before slipping away again. I decided to try that one match after a rank reset, I simply got my stacks of BBQ and then... I just goofed off and took it easy. I'd chase survivors around teabagging the whole way, I'd sometimes see baby survivors trying to hide with an arm sticking out from behind a tree and pretend they're invisible, sometimes I'll down a survivor near the end and carry them to the exit. I did a meme build on Wraith and had a blast, and in general, had more fun than I've had before.
---
I don't care.
---
I at least know no and ingles
---
Always keep that camera rostering because twice, in my previous matches, I have acted like a new player and let Michael level up to Tier III 😂
---
Lowkey? This is Bubba we're talking about here right?

This game isn't a hide and seek simulator. Help your team.

Inner Strength over Second Wind too

If you are getting crappy spawns then use indoor map offerings or use thrill of the hunt

If i could read what the hell it says in the screen i could think of a reason...but anyways ill just say that the are some challenges that can be done even if it says (survivor) or (killer), they get done indirectly like sacrifice 15 survivors even if you're the one being sacrificed..well a survivor IS being sacrificed
---
Nobody likes immersed players when they're in your game so why defend them?
---
That's possible though...
---
You can have the perk equipped and use No Mither
---
Stay woke, I did the sane and have 0 regrets
---
I completed a sacrifice challenge as surv so who knows.
---
Incoming comments telling you to just find a teammate, ignoring the fact that Inner Strength gives you a heal unaffected by Sloppy Butcher while being out if line of sight and invisible to aura reading like BBQ or NC.
---
Main issue is that his power is pretty much garbage without addons and he has to bring multiple Survivors into T3 madness to really create any sort of disruption/pressure.  That and once Survivors are in T2 they stay that way for the rest of the game and at best the Doctor gets a basic pointer at where they might be based off of the random illusions.
---
He basically suffers from the same issue Leatherface does where neither of them are really able to create pressure and their powers both feel crappy unless you slap addons on them.
---
Bug - PC
---
Been playing clown lately and I had someone just click the flashlight at me once and I was infinitely blinded for the rest of the game. Also I was able to grab someone while unhooking, but they still got the unhook.
---
It's more of a extra precaution. Once yui comes out I will probably run her pallet cleaner upper perk instead of second wind. With second wind and ds, if I get tunneled I wouldnt get any use out of second wind either way, so getting a get out of jail free card is great. I run into a lot of people running sloppy and other antiheal things, so having to not need to heal is good when I dont get tunneled, aka whenever ds would be useless. I play pretty stupid tho so I need to run DS to keep from dying every game...
---
Exactly this! The speed is the real helpful part. And with ruin in every game, you know you'll proc it.
---
And I prefer crouching near windows so I’m in better position to use my lithe...  
---
In regards to your “help your team” comment. I was just doing the gen that the killer blows up in the clip. Half the team dced. I fail to see what more I could do to help my team when it’s half gone and the killer is right next to me.
---
Could've been the bigger man. Pick them up, bring them to the hook, then go back and drop them.
---
Or everyone can come here and spam, "YEAH FUCK THOSE TOXIC SCUM"
---
nice circlejerk.
---
I'm guessing you had Franklin's? It may have eaten the medkit and counted it for you.
---
God no i like the oni its the first killer I like after the spirit I really want to have a new main
---
Sure, that's the way you like to play. But OP didn't have to take aggro for anyone, and I'm not going to decide what type of player they are from a 16 second video.
---
You can balance it by the times of being each killer being short. Meaning if you play hag, you will have only so little time to place traps etc. and use them to allow couterplay. Same can be said about bubba being there only for some time period. Or billy using his power to get around the map and then it is close to being gone.
---
Let’s say, about 20-30 seconds of power usage?
---
I really should. None of them ever know how to loop.
---
They also ran into a place they were sure to be chainsawed because it was like a narrow hallway so I'm going to assume they don't get into chases much.
---
Every entity is weird.
---
If you crouch, won't you slow vault?
---
Urban evasion OP plz NERF.
---
More like disappointed.
---
The constant variation would. Also, it won’t be as broken, as the transformations would last limited time period, and cannot be used again before going through all other ones.
---
Yes but you’re assuming I’m crouching and vaulting. I was crouching next to a window, waiting to use my lithe if I had to.
---
I need more people to play with honestly! I'm no god at the game but im good enough to rank up alot while playing by myself
---
Probaly the only time I will willingly use a broken key
---
Thanks, you too.
---
😂😂😂
---
Gross, Mitch McConnell. 🤢
---
They also weren't expecting to get rubber banded right in front of the killer.
---
Perk?
---
Fair enough man. Did you see the ping was bad in the pre game lobby or was the killer lag switching or something?
---
Delete swf nerf iris delete morís
---
Hes probably a south American lol
---
I would've used my Lithe to get away once the 2 people lagged out of the game.
---
...it's missing a comma
---
Well they can be explained. Demogorgon is still the newest killer, depending on when they took the stats from he may not have even been a part of the first few days of testing, either way he most likely has the least data of any killer, not to mention he is a licensed DLC killer that costs more than others, so not everyone has him compared to other killers. Also Nurse's kill rate is most likely due to her steep learning curve, don't tell me you never faced a baby Nurse who was incapable of ever downing a single survivor in the whole match. Clown is just a clown.
---
The stats may seem skewed, but if you have an understanding of the game, it can be easy to interpret roughly why a killer lands where they do.
---
Is he just deleting it and reposting it trying to get Karma or something?
---
TBH I think most Killers are fine except for a few obvious exceptions on the high (Freddy, Spirit) and low (Leatherface, Doctor, Clown) ends of the spectrum. Like people keep trash talking Legion and Wraith or praising Billy and Huntress for being good but I've won countless games as L / W and won against countless B / H at high ranks.
---
The problem rests far more in perks than in Killer selection. I played with some of my high rank friends today (haven't played much this reset what with the Archives and all, as well as being swamped for finals) and I swear the matchmaking was astounding. Game after game of Killers running Ruin, BBQ, Pop Goes, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Discordance, Sloppy Butcher, Save the Best for Last - Every fucking game regardless of Killer. It got to the point that the only game we ever had fun was against a Basement Billy running Iron Grasp and Agitation to get basement hooks for the Rift. (Also because he was really freaking good at the game.)
---
It's the same on the flipside too. Two people in our group left and we started playing with randoms: every single random at Rank 1 has the exact same build - Balanced Landing / Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Iron Will. Once in a blue moon you see Borrowed Time or Self Care or Urban Evasion or Prove Thyself. Once in a lime green moon you'll see a non-meta perk that's been in the game for less than 2 years.  
---
I had some Killer dailies today and I'm not even that high of a rank but what do I get? Three games in a row of Survivors running Balanced Landing and Adrenaline. Nah fam Balanced Landing didn't need a nerf. Half of them have Decisive Strike too.
---
It's all fine and good to say that perks should be buffed to be on par with others but in the case of the meta there's nothing they can do other than flat nerf it. I don't want every perk to be on par with Decisive Strike and Dead Hard because it's obnoxious to go up against these perks every match. I don't want there to be Game Stall perks on par with Ruin because then every Killer is just going to run 4 game stall perks and win due to shear war of attrition. (We see this already with Freddy.) It's seriously unhealthy that the same handful of perks have been in the meta pretty much since the game's inception and those same perks have had little if any changes to their core mechanics. Behaviour keeps adding novelty after novelty with new low-tier Killers, garbage-tier perks, and Survivors that no one plays because their pained grunts are loud as shit. It's novelty after novelty that we buy again and again to distract ourselves from the fact that we've been playing the same game for 3 years running with the only changes being the introduction of Mettle of Man which was nerfed about a month later.
---
I want to play one match where it isn't 4 Neas / Claudettes / Megs with Balanced Landing / Adrenaline / Decisive Strike / Iron Will going up against a Billy / Nurse / Spirit running Ruin / BBQ / Sloppy / Enduring. Of course if they were to change these perks there would have to be some tweaks to the baseline mechanics (gens being slower, it being easier to break a chase) but I'm so sick of Behaviour giving us baseline mechanics as perks. So that whenever an actually cool perk comes out like the ability to pick up pallets or hide your terror radius or heal after being unhooked or kick gens automatically I always have to ask "Why would I run this when I require 3 out of 4 perk slots to function at a baseline level?"
---
Probably best to do Adepts at rank reset, friend.
---
Is that it? Clip of the killer? On ptb without matchmaking and potatoes.. yes I did and it's not a point..
---
He looks like a weaker Billy, that's it. People on ptb are way different than live servers, just sayin
---
Masturbation is always enjoyable in the short term.
---
You don't pick no0b3 you hate dbd
---
What's the point of running insidious with wraith?
---
I had this with dropping pallets while being chased, it only counted like 2/3 of dropped pallets even though I 100% dropped them while chase music was on and all.. Pretty annoying
---
Yeah I didn't either until the start of the tier 2 tome challenges. It tipped me off after the match ended and I was like wait a minute I never used selfish care once during that match and I had progress for selfish caring twice but the randoms did have it and I watched rhem selfish care while I'm sitting on the hook dying. So I tested it out with some friends and every time someone selfish cared it counted to progress for everyone. We took hits from killers just to get the shit done. Then we played some coins and brought in the borrowed time med kits and took hits just to dump the kit for the challenge. We had most of the challenges done in 4 or 5 matches. 
---
I'm not sure if it works this way with the teir 3 tome challenges that just recently came out. I've been to  busy working and playing the medeival 4k remake for ps4 pro to find out.
---
Selfcare is pretty bad imo especially if you are playing with 2 friends
---
Probably, hes had like 1 person agree with his stance in the 4+ times hes posted it lol.
---
Uh... I guess he was excited to down someone? If he's like a grey rank. Probably wanted to secure a kill. If I didn't have a more experienced friend teach me the game when I was new, I would be completely clueless and think shit like that is okay.
---
Him getting Mori’d is soooo creepy. Especially Nurse
---
WHAT I NEED IS THE STAGGER REDUCTION FROM BL BACK PLS JUST REMOVE THE BOOST IDC ABOUT THE BOOST I NEED THE STAGGER REDUCTION, or just fix the map layout ffs
---
&gt;Kills =/= Medals
---
Oh right
---
Isn't this bannable? Posting the same thing over and over again trying to get a positive response or a lot of Karma or something?
---
Did you participate in the altruism experiment?
---
Well I will from now on...
---
So glad you like ☺️ I’ve posted a bunch of others in an album if you want to see those too

I've actually gotten halfway decent teams as survivor, but more often than not solo survivor is a mess.
---
The only time I had over a mil was when being reimbursed lost no.
---
Yay I’m glad you like it! I’ve posted an album of (almost) all the other survivors as well!
---
Well the first letter is D so we've gotten that far
---
I'm too lazy to contact the mods. But I guess if he posts it again, I'll ask about it.
---
I love it when this happens
---
exactly, so if you get a 4k by facecamping, or by barely 1 hooking everyone at the endgame with NOED, don't be surprised if you don't pip.
---
I wish I had all those perks "when I was bad"... still grinding through hell
---
Standard version is also easy to juke and it has a long charge time.  Any addons that modify the shock also increase the charge time.
---
Imagine being put into a nightmare hellscape by a god made of hate, scrambling to fix electrical equipment with zero experience, strange noises all around you.   
---
A lone voice, with the volume of thousands, cries from the nearby woods: "DEEEEEEE JAYYYYY KHALED, WE THE BEST"
---
Killer queues up to rank 14 on PC really suck. After that they're fine for the most part until like low purples-reds.
---
Just added and invited you :)
---
I have a skeleton key and my friend has a map btw.
---
BHVR is in Canada so idk why they’d do one honestly
---
I don't get it, how are they being toxic. They gave him a bunch of extra hits for blood points, isn't that good? Honestly survivors can only emote, crouch, and click use on their item so besides standing still what did you want them to do while giving the free hits? Honestly asking here
---
Name is now canon.
---
Ya I reported it as spam, hes just baiting or trying to get karma because everyone has said the same thing. Well see if anything happens but it doesn't bother me either way hes wasting his own time making the same exact meme lol.
---
Had the best survivor game of my life. Much more aggressive than I usually play, stunned Ms. Piggy at least five times.
---
Three iris, one gold. Got no credit. I know it’s a known issue, but it took the wind out of my sails.
---
No ;-; please. Bubba goes through too much.
---
Blood test, depending on the numbers, might turn into MoM all over again.
---
* Matchmaking
---
* People suiciding on first hook
---
* map balance and map RNG
---
* how quickly ruin gets found
---
* Key escapes
---
* 18 Killers which all vary in effectiveness each map
---
Too many things to consider, so hopefully the "experiments" helped find issues
---
Well he already had a hook which is weird. I'm rank 16. He had a few perks so I dont he was super new.
---
I'm sorry. They delayed a simple hotfix to fix busted challenges by a week. Given that the Archives were supposed to make up for a lack of new content, it's pretty understandable to be annoyed by this.
---
Yes it was!!! It blocked a solid 4th of the screen in my experience.
---
that doesnt add anything new though. He is just all the killers, thats so boring
---
Why is better to hit with frenzy and cancel it than to run away and find someone else to hit during frenzy?
---
It was a joke... Because of Object of Obsession?
---
Trapper sets some traps down next to each other and throws the survivor onto then 
---
Wraith goes invisible then the survivor gets up then Wraith bashes the survivors head withered the bell and drips of their head with the spine attached
---
Or the wraith could tear out their spine
---
I find it hard to say if they're greedy or not. I know that there are different teams for coding/bug fixes/and stuff, and for creating cosmetics. However if we look at the amount of bugs thag keep coming into this game, the matchmaking still being ridiculous and dedicated servers that took so long to make that'a still quiet bad, then I feel like they could expand their team and spending more money. 
---
The cosmetics I find expensive, but they're fully optional so I don't complain. I think the chapters however are fairly priced, especially since you can buy most of them with shards. I don't think they're doing any worse or better then othee games on this aspect.
---
So overall I find it hard to say. I feel like I'm slightly leaning towards finding the devs greedy, but it might just be due to some frustration of the game not working optimal.
---
I do go for saves most of the time, i try most of the time with the ruin skillchecks but sometimes i just start tapping the gens if i get like 324234 ruin skill checks xD i try not to waste pallets most of the time especially if i see someone who can loop the killer better than me, i use perks like lithe, iron will, inner strenght and the last is  WGLF or BT. I do need to pratice loops like you said.  Umm i got the game when it was 1st released but i didnt play it much untily last year i started playing it more often.
---
Idk I still don't see how mending is annoying. I normally play huntress and try to make every injured at all times anyway cause of sloppy butcher, nurses calling, and thanatophobia. Wouldn't that be annoying too? The legion hate is just so weird to me lol
---
Having to build up power for a long time and being a m1 fatass loud killer before that isn't a drawback? Maybe losing your power when picking up a survivor and having to ignore survivors in lockers isn't a drawback? His power must be strong for an ability with limited duration and for which you need to work for some time
---
I'mma take my downvotes for this, but I think it's worth saying:
---
If you're a survivor, and notice one or two of our team *not* doing anything (either contributing to gens or they're standing still from spawn) I don't see a problem with this.
---
Wait times while in queue can be a while.  Insidious bubba camping a basement, or just a few caming killers in general, can make the round seem not worth sitting around for... especially if gens are popping &amp; no one  is coming to help you.  Or worse: you're hooked &amp; everyone's too afraid to do any gen repair work thereby shooting themselves in the foot.
---
Or what is a player supposed to do if the lag gets *that bad*?
---
I don't know.  I get salty when players DC or will themselves closer to THE ENTITY, but at the end of the night I understand there's more than just shitty sportsmanship.
---
I've DC'd &amp; Suicided on the gaffing hook a few times when delivery arrives.  You think Imma eat that shit *cold* so you can have a *better game*?  *Heeeell NO*.
---
I think greed comes with success. They've made a very successful game.
---
With this build the odds of all five gens being done is low.
---
I believe it’s morally. Either way it’s stupid
---
U IS FOR U R E T H R A
---
Ahh
---
Fair enough.
---
Ah yes, go watch Tru3 for optimal gameplay

Actually "Chupo" mi verga means "I suck my cock". Chupame la Verga is suck my cock.

You’re not fooling anyone, they’re just too scared to turn against you in fear of what you’ll do to them when they do, Nea.
---
Cubiccoder16025, hope to play sometime.
---
I think you're taking this a bit out of context. The person who you say is "whining about spirit" is a steamer who has made valid points to the game-play of spirit and isn't a fog whisperer because they criticize BHVR and certain people working there . The person who responded is that person's significant other and they both have a tendency to be overly sarcastic and sarcasm doesn't translate well through text. This whole post is petty and they're are so many other things to complain about and other fog whispers that definitely don't deserve that title but it's all meaningless anyways so go hog wild.
---
Unless they've changed him since I played him on PTB, it takes absolutely no time to build up his power, like at all. No, none of the others I would consider drawbacks considering how powerful he is.
---
okay, since nurse has a sub 50 killrate better see some fat buffs on her soon
---
The only survivors that I get mad about seeing in the pregame lobby is Feng with colored hair. No other survivors troll and antagonize me as much as they do. If I wanted to complain about other survivors I would have.
---
Ok thanks everyone, you guys were really helpful :D
---
Oh ok thank you, I'll keep trying them, maybe bond and dark sense will do it.
---
Buy some rechargeable Xbox batteries it will change your life
---
Right but if it gave you + %100 blood points and made you completely silent, there could potentially be some viability. For example if you used that with this is not happening and that perk that makes you do everything %10 faster when injured.
---
There are videos on YouTube but basicly anything that was given at an event, like attend world poker your Brazil 2018 get a code for an eclusive hat. Well now the codes are now sold for a bunch of money for rare ones. Its a lot of pc exclusive stuff that allows console players to use them now.
---
Seriously, I hope you find purpose in your life. You've done nothing but stalk me all day. I went through your history, and TiKeS SweAtY. You see, prick, I can play that game too. Figures you're a Billy main. You match perfectly with how they play.
---
Wait no bcuz that $1,00 thing, it says something about being charged $25 the next 3 months
---
that's literally what my post was about
---
Word of advice, if you feel like you want to prestige make sure at the very least you play enough games to birn through your BP bonuses, use any add ons you've been saving,   You may also want to build up your Bloodbank.  I typically only prestige a character when I have at least 800,000 Bloodpoints to reinvest into the character.
---
Noooooooooooooooooooo
---
This reminds me of a time I reported my friend for t-bagging the killer
---
The ultimate power

They are releasing the legacy cosmetics so it's fair for console players

Ohhh the mending vs healing difference got me confused

You take yourself way too seriously. Never been called a dork before?

You must be fun in real life lol

ULTIMATE POWER
---
Welcome to dead by daylight!
---
Seriously though, people do this sometimes, and it sucks. Once you get high enough, there are very few of these people, but sometimes it happens. But at higher ranks, they usually do it to intentionally ruin your game. At lower ranks, i don't know with every killer.
---
Get the mountain volcano
---
Congratulations on using dead hard
---
Thank you for your service to make this game even better 👍❤️
---
Oh, ill make sure to have ebough bp then, thanks
---
Set up a privacy card for $1.10. You will get the 3 months and Microsoft can not charge anymore then that
---
Maybe
---
Oh, I knew about those, I was hoping you meant those Oni cosmetics. They look so sick.
---
Seems you've taken a picture or [REDACTED] instead of mental hemeroids
---
I mean I kinda would consider myself fun irl although I think the people I hang out with contribute to that. Also it was a joke like seriously why be so uptight.
---
I never did this cause I watched Noob3, Otz and a few others for a while before I decided to pick the game up. I had basic knowledge on how everything worked, what perks to get first, how to run loops etc.
---
Your post also depicts ‘survivor mains’ as being silent in regards to that
---
well besides D strike, all the “meta” perks come with the base game (i’m saying meta = adrenaline, borrowed time, dead hard, etc.)but definitely halloween / stranger things and you could get adam on his own for deliverance memes if you really want to.
---
You have been crowned worthy by Dead Hard
---
He who is worthy shall be able to ~~actually use the fucking perk as intended~~ dodge many a fatal attack
---
I'd only watch one of my favorite streamer who had tried the game. A couple months later, it came out on console so that's when I started. The streamer was new, but I loved the concept of the game. Felt so unique and awesome. I didn't watch any top streamers, he was a small time guy who was one of the best Killer Instinct players in the world, but played DBD for a while. Then he moves to Facebook gaming, I don't have Facebook, never watched him again.
---
Oh no, rank doesn't matter at all. I see rank 16 players play better than the rank 3 nea who only got there with spine chill and urban evasion.
---
Pretty much. I’m not sure if it works the other way around, but it would be worth it to throw on a survivor challenge and play a few rounds of Killer to see.
---
I was a rank 13 GF and got all 4 red and purple rank survivors heh.
---
I’m pretty sure there’s some lag too, but I could be wrong.
---
I laughed so hard.
---
Good killers make sure the survivors had fun. This is the will of your BHVR overlords. They don't give a fuck about you. They sell 4x as many survivor cosmetics.
---
Mods are gay
---
*grey rank niggas*
---
I usually run ruin, bbq, haunted and sloppy.
---
Then i slap on some addons until i run out of the good ones.
---
i already had all the chapters so i just bought Nea cosmetics since she’s my main survivor but this is definitely a great time to pick up DLC that you may be missing.
---
Have a farm game then slug everyone, open the gates and get at least 2 kills in endgame
---
Complete opposite for the ps4 right now.
---
So, Legion on release was... An enigma.
---
Basically, Frenzy stabbing a survivor twice in a chase would decrease their mend bar, and the mend bar would decrease simply by not being in a chase rather than the terror radius altogether. This meant that because Legion can fast vault pallets and just keep stabbing over and over, he could just get free Frenzy stabs four times and he was guaranteed to win the chase. 
---
Alternatively, he had a moonwalk exploit - applying deep wounds to someone, then looking behind you/at the floor to follow the blood trail would break the chase and make the timer go down even though you were right behind the survivor, forcing them to go down.
---
However, Legion wasn't overpowered when played as intended - They were garbage. But simultaneously, they were uncounterable. They received changes in order to fix the issue of Legion being unwinnable against in a chase, but this now means Legion is seen as boring to both face and play for most of the community as he's generally nonthreatening but causes a lot of healing.
---
Apologies for the text wall but release Legion was probably the worst thing the game has had in a long while - if you enjoy playing them, all the power to you! I actually do too, it's fun to just go around stabbin'.
---
I beg your pardon?
---
Wait I went to the game pass thing and there's 2 plans...1mnth $10 and 3 months, $1.00....but Xbox One S came with 1 month free trial...can I get DBD for free that way if I dnt pick a plan and instead just enter the code thts on the 1 month free trial ?
---
that's the issue, i dont know what else to get. i think i over spoiled myself
---
Already tried that. Thanks for the suggestion though.
---
Why would you own both XBox and PS4? Let me guess, you also own a Switch and pay sub fees for all 3 of them, but think PC gaming is too expensive. Typical console babby.
---
That Jeff sweater is sick

Russian roulette. get notifications for totems being worked on and zoom over for free grabs they can't see coming. However due to changes in the next update it'll be a bit weaker, so act fast.
---
What brought him here?
---
had to give my favorite survivor something nice
---
I find myself at rank 1 a lot and i just play to have fun. As long as I pip I could care less if I escape. Had plenty of games where that trade let that survivor pip up.
---
I play claudette all the time! The bright, glow-in-the-dark serum claudette. I haven't used Urban evasion in ages. Not since the 70 or 80 hour mark of the game. And even then, i only crouched in the terror radius. Stealth is really good, and really helpful. But if you only ever stealth, you will be fucked by the killers who know what they are doing. You need to learn how to chase.
---
If this survivor is a trash, then yeah. If you are a good player then you just play more safe than usually and oni is fucked.
---
Steve is more than just his scoops ahoy costume. Also, no Nancy? /triggered
---
You’re complaining about a Plague Face Camping at the end of the game when generators are done...
---
What do you expect them to do? Fuck off into a corner after hooking you?
---
You sound more like an entitled survivor than a killer main.
---
Very groovy
---
Not really, but okay, agree to disagree.
---
Ah yeah lol.
---
Three perks would be :
---
1. Hex: Sculpted denial
---
Whilst the associated hex totem stands any other hex totem cleansed will remove this totem instead
---
2. Stuck in the mud
---
Any basic attack on a survivor will apply the exhausted status effect for 30 seconds.
---
3. Play more with the claymore:
---
Increases the range of a basic lunge attack by 10%
---

It's funny reading this because I've also been experimenting on different builds. I made this build: Poised (hey remember this perk?), Lithe, Dance with Me, and quick &amp; quiet to escape the killer during chases. It has worked out for me quite well. To my surprise, a killer actually sent me HATE MAIL for being a 'coward and pussy' for running this build when it's only job is the help me escape the killer during a chase which it did! I lost the killer 3 times during a chase and he sent me a barrage of messages for 'hiding' all match when I'd do generators, rescue people, and escape chases. He called poised a try hard perk when NO ONE uses it. I was laughing nonstop because his biggest pet peeve was not hooking me once to get his 4th BBQ stack. Like how entitled do you have to be? Geez!

But these lead paint chips I found inside a locker are tasty, how can I eat and repair at the same time?

What? Did you read my post at all? Or did you just read the title, skip to where you read "face camping Plague" and then comment? Probably what you did. Moron

I'm new to xbox so I need help lol
---
Jason joined Legion?
---
Trappers pls for the love of god use ur brain you’re making him look bad
---
Really
---
No. BHVR will fuck it up and make it as bad as Dying Light.
---
I have an Xbox, PS4, wii, switch, DS, and PC :) I prefer console at this point in my life because I can sit on the couch and play. To use our desktop I need to sit in an office chair, which I can’t do because of my disability.
---
Keep on assuming though 👍🏻 you’ll guess right one of these days!
---
I left off the ones I couldn't think of something for
---
Interesting button configuration
---
"Choke me harder"
---
oooh I forgot that sub existed
---
Don't be. You'll run across survivors you have mercy on, and they'll call you cancer and tell you to kill yourself. Sweep the leg. It's the only way they'll learn anything.
---
reminder that for every time you get hit by a bullshit hit, a killer swung and didn't connect a clear hit
---
also daily reminder that fast vault does not mean iframes.

Guys maybe bringing ur rank 20 friends into red ranks isn’t the best idea...
---
Eh, don’t let people tell you it was a waste of money. People pay for convenience all the time so they don’t have to spend a lot of time on something.
---
Example: Picking fast food up for dinner instead of just making your own at home.
---
What you choose to spend your money on is your business, and if you can afford it, what’s the harm?
---
Do you even know what this wojak is?
---
Because it’s DEAD by daylight not “I give the last person the hatch by daylight”
---
I had a great idea for him. How about him being able to hide in/as objects and grab survivors? He can hide in lockers or even gens and also could have manholes scattered around the map where he could hide. Imagine walking past a locker and being grabbed out of it. That would be terrifying and would fit his aesthetic.
---
TY, I put a lot of effort and thought into it!
---
Then why use it wrong
---
I literally had this happen. She face camped someone and slugged me next to the hook. Thank god I had unbreakable, borrowed time and desicive and we all got out 😂
---
I use it however I want
---
I don't own it personally but i have seen multiple posts like these and people have said that Survivor matches are found in 1-2 minutes, even instant. And killer range between 5-10. So you shouldn't have a problem!

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e48l4i/anyone_know_when_the_updates_to_level_3_are/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

It’s hit and miss really. Sometimes you get ranked with your own rank, sometimes you get stuck with higher or lower.
---
I’d say average though? It’s pretty decent.
---
Ahh to be 11 again
---
You are just looking for excuses at this point. But sure, why not, I am up for debate. 
---
First of all - it is called spawns. The only map that has different variations per se is Badham Preschool. Spawns include the following:
---
- hills
---
- jungle gyms
---
- pallet placements
---
- small structures such as Cow Tree (Coldwind), Excavators (Autoheaven), rocks (MacMillan) + others, but those three are most visible and well-known.
---
- windows
---
Totems spawn in a very distinctive places. There is only a NUMBER of certain locations that they spawn. They are very much visible. You can deduct where they are. If you can't - then it means that you are new to the game and there is nothing wrong with it. This perk will be a problem till you learn how to spot totems and will find them easily on any map.
---
To make it easier for you - imagine a pentagram. Imagine that the map is a pentagram. The spots where the lines cross each other and/or end up - check those ones.
---
I just don't get the appeal of Noob3. Credit where credit is due: he's a pretty good survivor, but virtually everything I've seen from him is playing SWF against green ranks. Added to that, his edits the videos (and swears) like a middle schooler.
---
IMO Painreliever is an overall better survivor, more well rounded player, and far more enjoyable to watch - yet he only has a fraction of the fan base. Added to that, he has none of the toxic baggage or drama - which really seems to be the basis of Noob3's popularity.
---
For some reason redditors have outlawed emojis because theyre stubborn shits
---
Bruh I feel this on a spiritual level
---
Myers is gimic demo is good
---
I can't imagine much has changed since then unless you're a fast learner, that DLC isn't that old
---
Literally could be fixed in a day but nah lets wait until the next patch to release it
---
Good killers arent killers. Theyre just a nuisance, just be a nuisance and youll get rewarded by pipping
---
99 the gate, then start deciding.
---
Because PC Reddit is sooooo much better
---
I'll take the extra hits. IDGAF why they are there, but I'll take all the BP I can get.
---
Eh Idk I’ve just been watching noob for a while now so I guess it’s familiarity a bit? Different people enjoy different things is all. Ill check out painreliever though
---
No I think it was a billy with the auto mo-boys cosmetic from the rift. Right before the match you said the killer was definitely bringing a mori.
---
I ran bond, and had 1 swf teammate. It was a weird ghostface too, so i ended up doing almost 4 full gens by myself, while my friend kept the 2 randoms from getting tunneled to death.
---
Lol every time I've gotten to EGC since getting to the challenge everyone is either dead on hook or the killer goes AFK or DCs
---
The amount of times I get a message post game saying “that was a fast vault trash killer fix your internet” is amazing.
---
I fucking love this
---
Why does this shit never work for me 🤔
---
Currently gen grabber. Won‘t work after the nerf though. I run:
---
Prayer Beads/Yakuyoke Amulet
---
Corrupt Intervention/BBQ/Dying Light/Whispers
---
After the nerf I‘d say it‘s any build with Father‘s Glasses, Mother Daughter Ring and Sloppy Butcher.
---
*holds controller with one hand to tap the left bumper with my other finger* ha, fuck you entity
---
Just hook the survivors smh
---
PS4 surv queue takes a million billion years and killer takes two seconds, at least at lower ranks
---
For the past three games I’ve gotten iri benevolent and it hasn’t even counted. I’m literally 14/15.
---
\#GiveUsRNGlessRuin
---
I did read your post. I also read the part where you bitched about a Killer face camping you at the EGC like they're supposed to be doing something else at that time. So again, what do you expect the killer to do? Fuck off into a corner after hooking someone just so you can unhook?
---
You also seem to complain about tunneling as well, as if maybe you're just an entitled survivor with some sort of rulebook about how other people should play the game that only benefits you.
---
Stop bitching, crybaby.
---
Mikey
---
*i just have the pink hair with the mask because I think it’s her best looking cosmetic, I don’t even play survivor anymore but I still bought it lmao*
---
OOF
---
Found the guy who runs NOED every game LOL
---
Buy ghostface and spirit.
---
Yeah see, no one said that though, you people are just acting like the stats don't mean anything or aren't valuable or that killers are actually weak but the stats lie or something.
---
Nurse has always been well known to have actual skill behind her play style, and after her rework it's even harder to just jump into a game and 4k anyone just cause you can teleport through walls.
---
Killers like Billy have literally always over performed and it's absurd to ignore the stats and act like they don't matter because you can bring up an outlier like nurse that is easily explained.
---
Far more enjoyable is completely subjective and your own personal thoughts. You gotta remember everyone’s different. If you don’t get the appeal it’s a personality thing. You can call someone a better at a game, just not better to watch without being completely biased
---
That was a little late don't you think?
---
HH is great
---
He be teleporting like in the movies
---
Well it depends, do you want to be loud and scary or quiet and scary
---
Ruin is not gonna help against SWF.  Unless you babysit it all round they will find it within a minute or two.  Those kind of groups usually have someone who knows the totem spawns or has small game.  Sometimes you might luck out and keep it up for a while but most of the time you'll be playing with 3/4 perks.  Comms truly break the game but nothing can really be done because if they remove SWF a large chunk of the population will just leave.  They could at least give BP bonus to killers who have to face them.
---
i think you'll live lol. and wdym lack of new content? they add new killers &amp; survivors like every couple months. the game has changed significantly over the past year, and the archives / rift is just an extra luxury. so while it's an inconvenience, i see no reason to be so hostile towards the devs on the internet lmao.
---
That's an awesome idea!
---
I only said that because people on here said not to waste my money on dlc when I was originally going to buy it. But it is my money so who cares
---
shout out to these guys they know whats up
---
&gt;it’ll just keep on going if so i want to see buffs to killers like legion, who we were gonna get a huge buff too with that new perk but by the looks of things that ain’t gonna happen because it’s ‘overpowered’.
---
lmao
---
I agree. Love it
---
inaccurate meme, isn’t a doctor skill check with ruin and unnerving presence as close to the start as possible
---
Facts
---
Myers has three distinct playstyles that are all fun.  Demo is fun too but if you can only get one, get Myers.  If you buy his pack Laurie comes with it and you get Decisive Strike so it is a win either way.
---
Myers
---
I actually go out of my way to avoid green keys in the bloodweb, so now i don’t have any to waste. :’(
---
такова жизнь на восточном фронте
---
Change your name to Salazar from the newest Pirates of the Caribbean movie. He always left 1 man alive to tell the tale. 
---
If i destroy the team, or someone did something really good, while never being toxic, I'll let them go.
---
I dunno what everyone is on about with legion. I’ve only ever seen legion wreck shop.
---
Yeah, he made it personal just a little bit ago. I made a couple posts about Hillbilly being too strong (my opinion), and he started flinging insults, whilst his posse down-voted me to oblivion. Like basically all subreddits, this one has a very strict group-think, and little sociopaths like u/MegapellicanOne love trying exacting their power over "wrongthinkers" online. It's very sad.
---
The hidden rules of the sub are:
---
All Killers are perfectly balanced except Spirit, Legion Wraith, and Bubba; and Killer mains cannot have opinions that suggest nerfing Killers. Any dissent will be met with enough vitriol to sour one's entire entire day.
---
I always take empathy/bond over self care. It’s a great info perk and helps you locate team members.
---
I'm a woman, but I will leave...
---
So far he’s sent me a private message with some colorful language. 
---
And responded to four of my previous comments, some not even in this thread throwing condescending words around. 
---
Dude is a Class A weirdo.
---
**Scratch that. FIVE comments about me now.
---
Honestly that sounds like an entirely new killer idea more than anything.
---
Huntresses always dc.  
---
Always.
---
Just play a more fun and easier killer for you and dump your load of points into her bloodweb.
---
Ghostface downed a survivor pretty quick at the start of the trial and wounded another. First survivor DC’d after being downed and second survivor DC’d shortly after (right when I was about to be done healing him.)
---
So soon as I enter the code, its gonna be free ? I dont need to buy the $1 one to get it free ?
---
I agree, Hag's also imo
---
Fuck it, as long as your bangin on the gen with me I give no fucks!
---
poor meg :(
---
Camping is just a big L on the killers forehead and not really your fault unless being toxic. Best thing is just to move onto next match.
---
I think he deserves pats. :)
---
Yeah, me too &lt;3
---
I guess I'm fortunate I haven't heard from him.
---
I'm not bothering to talk about your team's incompetence because I don't have any issue with that. I have issue with you bitching about camping, so I bring that up.
---
You then think that because you happened to write about another topic in addition to the camping, that the issue about you bitching about camping can be ignored.
---
Do you have this much a hard time understanding simple things in real life or are you just a fucking idiot online?
---
I'll make it fucking simple for your grade-school addled mind. You bitched about [Topic A] and [Topic B]. I called you out for [Topic B]. You are now screaming about [Topic A] as if it is somehow relevant to the focused conversation about [Topic B]
---
How fucking stupid are you that you needed that spelled out?
---
----- 
---
And Boo-Fucking-Hoo... The killer uses tactics to win the game like tunneling and camping. Why the fuck shouldn't they? Because you find it unfun? They're your fucking opponent. YOUR fun doesn't fucking matter to them, does it?
---
Do you play monopoly and expect your opponent to not buy property? Do you play basketball and tell your opponent to not try and make 3-pointers? So how the fuck are you so fucking entitled that you think you have any right to bitch that your opponent actively tries to kill you in a game **about your opponent actively trying to kill you**.
---
Nothing more than an entitled survivor. Fuck off, crybaby.
---
Yeah it's a known bug! They should be getting it fixed soon!
---
Oh don't even apologise for the wall of text. This is exactly what I wanted. That's super interesting and gives insight into why they're hated. Thanks a bunch! Do they play the same as their release state in terms of what you're aiming to accomplish?(that being stab and run)
---
lmao at the downvotes. i don't think people on reddit know sarcasm. xD
---
Not sure what the policy on links is but here:
---
https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2a6g6/new_friend/
---
When I play killer, anytime I see a survivor trying to sandbag, I tunnel the shit out of the sandbagger and ignore the one they were trying to screw over. Same thing with unsafe hook saves (though I will slug the survivor that just got off the hook, to prevent the bad teammate from getting safe rescue points). You did nothing wrong by playing immersed, play how you want. Don't let assholes get you down. You can only be reported for taking the game hostage in very few situations that most likely will never occur throughout most people's dbd career. Have fun out there in the fog!
---
Hahah this is great! Especially knowing the movie.
---
Guess he feels attacked by me. 
---
Apparently I have a posse of people to downvote others while I ban bait others. Something is wrong in his head I think.
---
This was from 60 days ago. I’ve been playing pretty much every night since then so I’m 10x better since that point
---
Ive had a lot of killers be friendly and show mercy but I've never once had a Demo show mercy and it makes me sad ;-; I want to have friendly interactions with Demogorgon.
---
"Failed Successfully"
---
I believe it is because of a "killer mentality". 
---
You see, most of the time with killers you either have a 4k or a 2k. And even though you can still pip with two kills, you feel dissatisfied knowing that there is proof tainting you that you could have done better. 
---
For me it was the same when I started playing survivor. If I did not escaped, it was my "proof" that I could have done better. And maybe I could have, but then I start focusing on that and less on the experience of the game which I eventually learned that is not the point.
---
Hope they do!
---
Wtf is the difference? Its worse than Doc's!
---
If y’all could stop posting this dumbass shit. This has been known since lvl 3 came out. Pls for the love of god stop
---
Thanks! Hope to see you on the fog someday.
---
Billy seems really lame to me. I don't like how he looks, his chainsaw is really lame to me, and I'd just rather use his perks on other killers. Spirit's ability is cool but right now I'm focusing on Huntress and Legion. Low tier characters are the characters I go off with the most, anyway haha
---
Well, not exactly. You can't do the whole chase one survivor and keep frenzy stabbing them till they go down anymore, the general playstyle is to initiate chases with Frenzy, stab someone, go stab everyone else nearby, then get right up behind them and end Frenzy to start chasing them normally. 
---
Which was probably how they were INTENDED to play on release, but they were really, really badly designed lol
---
I know, I was just throwing shade at some idiot on here who obviously didn't read the whole post and called me an entitled survivor main who believes a killer shouldn't face camp when Gates are open. In my entire rant there's literally one sentence complaining about killers. And a description of what the Plague did. I blocked him though. I don't associate myself with Dumbfucks.
---
I think I'm blocked or he deleted his account... Where his username was it says deleted.
---
Really?, Well I rarely see any Demo's at all actually XD
---
they kill people. all of them
---
I think theyre also  scary because they are fast and  relentless,  cold and unfeeling, in fact, they take pleasure in your suffering, theyre sadistic, they are everywhere and overwhelming and most importantly the killing is a game to them, theres np pity, no reasoning, and its scary to have the penultimate moment of your life, your death, to be such a trivial activity for others.
---
I think  thats where the idea of their angle comes from.
---
Wow, DCing because you're being beaten fair and square. I was expecting you to say he camped or tunneled.
---
That is very true. I'm on Xbox and they're a dime a dozen. I feel like no one actually mains him.
---
Glad you think the same way bud! I wished you were on my games before. Maybe I could have learned this sooner.
---
Leather face is the weakest killer, with no pressure or speed around the map, like billy does. Leatherface is quite fun though. Try to get pop goes the weasel if it shows up in the shrine. If you are good, you might be able to make up for gen speed, but it's hard
---
Just saying Billy is a lot better than Legion is, more things you can do around loops as well.
---
LOL! I remember. Fun times.
---
Yeah, I play on PC and even then I don't see demogorgons, his power is very underrated
---
In my case, I didn’t know about this until now. I also didn’t know if this affected anyone else. If you are going to ask people to stop posting rants about the same bugs, no one is going to care if you criticize them instead of asking nicely.
---
The new Windows update causes a sound issue with Dead By Daylight. The sound is off and the bass seems to be lower and it has lesser quality.
---
I'm personally dog shit with him.
---
Really? How
---
Of course Oni is going to be released in a couple of days as well.
---
What’s the altruism experiment?
---
You’ve all heard of sleeper cars, now get ready for *sleeper jeffs*
---
They need a ban feature. If you DC you get like a 15-20 min ban. Im sick of people dcing before hooks. I smile when it happens because they rage quit. But after having it happen a few times it gets old.
---
Apparently "Jennifer Denisse" according to another comment
---
This explains it perfectly!
---
Is it like this for all claudette players o.o
---
Imagine if it costed money to post.
---
i love a fun ghosty
---
there's just something about it that makes me not even care when i get murdered later
---
Kid deletes his posts. 
---
That’s why I think it’s attention based. He’s not all there in the head.
---
I get your point but its still not fair to yell at someone who just wanted to clear some things up. Thats like a teacher yelling at a kid for asking a question when the answer was already stated but the kid missed it because they were out of the room. I don’t know how to describe this any other way.
---
Thanks for this
---
Heeeey, nice one!
---
Each to their own, I find curving with Billy incredibly fun. 
---
Have you tried Hag maybe?
---
It's being changed to 3 interrupts in an upcoming tome update anyway
---
I think the only thing about freddy are those damn dream pallets. That is so over powering.
---
Lol I play Killer more
---
I’d say he just wants confrontation and attention. 
---
I could probably get him banned from the sub for harassment but I doubt he’d have anywhere else to shitpost.
---
Just saying I think I can play either later or tommorow sorry :/
---
Killers don’t keep their add ons when DCing. Also devs are killer mains? Did you miss the spirit, nurse and legion nerfs that just happened?
---

---
Lol, actually it was a Trapper, and I escaped that game that got me thinking about it.
---
 nurse already being nerfed which i think was kinda bullshit    
---
tbh if u think the nerf was bs then u either didn't get her addons was insanely broken and her power well the cooldown does fuck all if u don't miss. The only true nerf to nurse is dedicated servers that mess with the blinks
---
Yeah it was like 3 months ago I don’t like toxicity
---
I think it would be cool if the other 3 walked around aimlessly. Give them a red stain, but no terror radius.  Then it just gives a sense of worry when you see one approaching until you know if it is the real killer or one of the bots.  Then legion would actually have a decent amount of map pressure without being overpowered.
---
I DC when this happens, at that point its not even a game
---
Yep.  Did this today.
---
Nobody downvoted him though. He's not my god. I just admire him for teaching me a lot about killer.
---
just help complete them
---
Nobody likes being insulted. Especially when they play fair. Human beings can have feelings.
---
Since it increases movement speed, does this mean it gets him going?
---
oh wait a minute I was about to say "bc you die before daylight" but it is named dead BY daylight oh no
---
Um, no. He's consistently been one of the strongest killers, and still is. Are you on something?
---
PC profile bug - my level randomly shot up to a really high level with a massive devotion level 
---

I feel like him being a smoker is more of the reason.
---
10/10 better graphics than dbd
---
I'm laughing so hard right now because I know you're not lying.
---
Niiiice!
---
I had this happen to me against The Doctor. I couldn't escape Madness 3 :(
---
I figured with MoM nerfed this could serve as a better alt
---
Billy is one of the best killers wtf kind of weed did you smoke?
---
I'm soooo totally going to steal that idea.
---
*noise noises*
---
When you both are fighting for the kill/sacrifice.
---
Alright well it’s not like some perks don’t do what other perks already do but better but like I said suggestions are always welcome
---
lmao good luck getting progress, the hotfix to solve this issue was coming with the changes but they delayed it.
---
The trick is, wait for a skill check, then go for the scratch
---
This subreddit seems to have a huge cult following around Noob3/Otzdarva while most of the other notable streamers are largely ignored or folks get downvoted if they bring those names up.
---
Like the Twitch Rivals event went by with basically no discussion on this sub even though it had some big streamers in it, just not this subreddit's favorites.
---
Monty Python and the holy grail is a absolute classic everyone should see at least once. I still remember how annoyed/angry i was by how aggressive my friend tried to get me to watch it with him.  
---
To this day its still my favorite movie together with the new and polished Planet of the Apes series
---
from my knowledge, no. I'm pretty sure you'd need a Cronus or XIM.
---
I believe if (on PS4 anyway) you close your application rather than quit in-game you end up keeping your addons.  That's what I've heard anyway, not sure if it's true/fixed/if there's an xbox equivalent.
---
I thought the same thing myself!
---
Only if they all get their own animations when you get close. Susie could wave, Joe could reel his fist back for a punch, Julie could point and laugh, and Frank could do a throat slitting motion. 
---
Or just aimlessly walking would be kill
---
Billy is 100% balanced
---
Love to play him and against
---
typically they cry about gen rush when they chase one guy for 2 minutes
---
I'M PISSED LMAO
---
Yeeeeesssssss! xD
---
Now I need to learn how to use custom icons to the game files and my life will be complete!
---
Thanks pal!
---
&gt;wtf kind of weed did you smoke?
---
Yes.
---
*Grunts in being unable to see Traps auras within 8m radius*
---
thot, survivors going their own way
---
Yes, but also no. Higher level characters ha e better perks and offerings that can help both boost overall bloodpoints gains per match, while also allowing you to complete more objectives during each match.
---
 
---
A good dbd player can still do those objectives with a low level player, and get maximum bloodpoints for the trial, but will ultimately get less than that same player with a high level character and offerings.
---
Didn't they say that only 5% of all matches are 4 man SWF though?
---
Goals tbh
---
Just got it for Switch from Gamestop for $20 new id recommend getting it. It comes with Spirit and Clown and Kate and Adam
---
Omg hahah nice
---
OC, egg
---
Ohhhh, an example could be distressing right ?
---
Let me see... You have a problem with Nurse and Spirit nerfs, then there's you complaining about (powerless) people having a discussion about nerfs to Freddy, then you insinuate that it was Reddit faults for nerfs to the duo (lol), then some more baseless worries about your 'boi'. 
---
Then you have some issue with red ranks being too difficult for you blaming the nerfs and those filthy survivor mains, then you have a first somewhat valid argument of devs not making other killers viable at red ranks, some more complaining and foreshadowing of the upcoming doom and apocalypse. 
---
An attempt at apology before posting a thread (nice), more baseless threats of doom and apocalypse, something about Legion being an uber god creator of the universe but then the man thinks 10 steps ahead and calls for another prophecy of doom for our upcoming killer, your actions were without caution towards some people that want to actually enjoy Reddit time discussions, here comes the best part, he's a DOCTOR, PIG and MYERS main... our man says he wants easy time getting at least 2k. Then, I believe our man had cooled downed his bloodlust and agreed the Spirit needed a nerf but nerfing prayer beads were a little too much to handle.
---
I agree but it's really annoying when you criticize things and use the stats to back up your argument just for Peanits or someone else to go "lol actually stats don't matter."
---
Haha that would be absolutely hilarious
---
thats because people just vent in memes/posts when they had reasons, too
---
Why make a post about that 25 great matches against good, non-toxic Killers/Survivors with fun interactions in the after game chat, when you can instead bitch about that one Feng you sandbagged you once
---
I accidentally got to purple ranks and because of all the challenges I have to be an altruistic degenerate, which causes me to pip more often since I'm usually a gen jockey/runner... The archives are a slippery slope to the sweaty hell of red ranks and I dont like it :P
---
There could always be some other new sub-killers (not as powerful as the original ones, but having strong situational use).
---
is this reverse psychology
---
The power is dumb. You lose progress for hitting survivors which is what you're supposed to do 😂
---
I hate using Ruin myself, because it feels like a waste of a perk slot sometimes. I even have occasions where it doesn't even spawn. If anything, SWF and general totem spawns occasionally make it a stupid idea to use, completely negating a perk slot
---
thanks! ill see if it happens again
---
What did you say?
---
That would require me to interact with him. 
---
I don’t know if I’ll do all that lmao.
---
ghostface is my fave killer to play against and I try to befriend him almost every match...doesn’t go well 85% of the time 🤣
---
Killer good, survivor bad.

#[STATUS UPDATE | ARCHIVES TOME 1 – LEVEL 3 CHANGES](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/108232/)
---
Hillbilly mains are physically disabled. 
---
Trapper mains are intellectually disabled. 
---
Ghostface mains are black dudes who like DBZ.
---
Clown mains are fat neckbearded incels.
---
Mike Meyers mains are the shy type who blame their farts on the dog. 
---
Legion mains like rape porn and torturing small animals. 
---
Freddy mains are angry schoolteachers who hate their students. 
---
Huntress mains are fat goth chicks. 
---
Hag mains have anger issues and clinical depression. 
---
Leatherface mains usually just want to watch the world burn, but will take you to the hatch if they're having a good day. 
---
Doctor mains are assholes, but usually they're just people trying to finish their dailies.
---
The end of the clip where he falls has me dying
---
I hate being tea bagged as killer, but there's nothing you can do about it. Luckily if your Ghostface, you can tea bag them back, but I don't have Nurses teachables so my Ghostface kinda sucks.
---
This is so overpowered lol
---
That's not all that's big.
---
Shitpost?
---
I just got my ghostface fully p3d but I dont bother teabagging bag. It's a waste of time I just hook them give them a little hit and move on.
---
Was he playing a Dwight? That sounds exactly like my friends game, he was playing myers and streamed it for me.
---
Or you could just let him start with all his traps. 
---
You can’t just remove the ability for him to step in his traps. Survivors having a random chance to get injured when disarming a trap isn’t exactly exciting either.
---
Precisely. The plot thickens fellow person of the mist.
---
I'm kind of glad they blocked me because they sound kind of scary. I try not to make enemies on the subreddit because I get anxious easy.
---
These sound fun! I wonder if they could be implemented if done to last survivor, that way we could have a longer Mori and finish the match with a blast
---
I didn't say "All" in reference to the Chaos gods. And I was talking about the big five.
---
Survivors are already slower than killers. Should survivors crawl on their hands and knees at turtle speed?
---
they just made a up to 50% sale for every non-new character even though they totally didn’t have to, so yes, totally greedy
---
/s
---
Who pissed in your cornflakes?
---
Not everyone is skilled
---
I think BMing people on hook is just as annoying as a survivor tea bagging.
---
Ehh. Living life in fear doesn’t do anything. 
---
If you want to have a conversation you should do it. Most kids on the internet are just attention deprived.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
This is hilarious but you’re going to hurt so many feelings lol
---
No thank you.
---
You literally told me to camp earlier today in order to counter DS suicide bombers
---
Exactly. That's why I do it when they do it. Typically I dont bm anyone unless provoked.
---
Thanos hates this because it's unbalanced
---
Just give him all his traps... The rest is overkill.
---
Me when I play doctor
---
Ghostfaces are so cute. I love when they show mercy. We can friendly tea bag at each other.
---
I had a game with my brother, my best friend (who’s super new to the game) and a random, and we were against The Shape. He hadn’t leveled up Evil Within all game. My brother gets downed while I lead my newbie friend to the exit gate, let him open it, and tell him I’m going to rescue my brother. Best friend opens the exit gate and stands in there. I get my bro off, heal him and we make our way back. I ask my friend “the killer still hasn’t come?” And he’s like “oh he’s here. He’s just staring at me.” I instantly realized we were all screwed.
---
Might have been.
---
He was in a locker, got pulled, wiggled, right back in same locker.
---
Got pulled, walked out of building (think it was a Preschool map) wiggled, ran back in same building same locker.
---
Got pulled, taken further away, wiggled out again, ran to same building, dropped pallet by locker, jumped back in same locker.
---
Busted pallet, got pulled, taken different direction, wiggled, ran to different house, jumped in a locker.
---
I think it happened 2-3 more times before EGC took him.
---
I wouldn't be able to focus on the game or my toilet business.
---
I wish it would just track them simultaneously. Or at least the available challenges in your path. Nothing like the feeling of not completing the challenge you selected but happened to do two other challenges you weren't tracking!
---
Is the Iridescent Age challenge bugged? Two games in a row 4 iridescent emblems as killer, only 1/15 progress per game. I have a screenshot if it helps. PC.
---
Bro. Thanks for the options but I just said I'm not looking for other killers to play. I'm playing legion
---
yes some killers do better than others. Just because a Nurse, Spirit, or Freddy can do it, doesn't mean a Wraith, Doctor, or Clown can't. Yes ultimately it does come down to preference, you can play whoever you want, nobody is forcing you to only play those killers and avoid others.
---
Yea a killer does well if a survivor dies early, that happens, quite often sometimes. I don't see why that shouldn't count, it's just the same as Ruin getting destroyed early and having a bad early chase.
---
I kinda lost what you're arguing here, I'm just saying killers are capable of winning, sure some have it harder/easier but it isn't like it's straight up impossible to in the average match. Sure you can bring up the 4 man SWF coordinated with 4 DS, OoO, a Prove Thyself, and Commodius toolboxes with BNP, but for every group of survivors like that there's a Prayer Beads Spirit, Omegablink Nurse, Iri Head Huntress, etc. all with an Ebony Mori.
---
Is the nerf to killers significant enough to shoot the survivors in the foot? Most killers have no problem catching survivors easily
---
*this guy is an attention seeker* he posted a meme about how Freddy and Hillbilly needed a nerf and kept deleting it when people would blast him.
---
That..... is not true.
---
Hm no I think he was on a different map, still it's funny shit and the whole situation is so silly from both sides perspectives.
---
On the plus side, you consistently terrify survivors as you creep towards them.
---
Ok i get it now, thanks
---
Yeah. I’ve been back to ghosty boy and split points between them
---
60 percent of the time, it works every time. 
---
Emblems are super broken, and they need to fix them.
---
Oh in thought you said you were, my bad.
---
Because the "optimization patch" was scrapped to allow them to slowly(very much apparently) roll out improvements to graphics and FPS.
---
HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER
---
And is now saying Hillbilly needs a buff. This subreddit doesn't need attention seeking trolls.
---
This post actually helped me more, I’m already a rank 1 survivor that runs perks to help me, whenever I die as a survivor, I feel discouraged because I lost when I made a mistake (or hitboxes), but since I saw this post, this helps me out more that even if I pip, I technically won, now I have an excuse to tell survivors when they are salty, thanks so much!
---
Painreliever is great, definitely one of my favorites and deserves more credit. I played one of my worst survivor matches ever again him and made it into a video he made. I was roasted to no end but loved it - it was well deserved lol. I love watching Noob though, he is less serious to me but not an asshat totally. I’ve learned a lot just watching his plays. Painreliever is great at breakdowns though. Plus....his voice.
---
I’ve tried both and they seem around the same. Also don’t they both have a cable you can plug into the controller to charge while playing anyway?
---
Don't hate on him for just trying to be immersed. Why do you think he's hiding in the bathroom.
---
I see “I always miss my lunge on survivors because I swing way too early so let’s make my problem everyone else’s too”
---
Blueberry bitch.
---
True
---
U there
---
I HAT E YOU
---
Nope. It's active all the time as soon as the match starts. Nothing extra to do. 
---
It's a pretty decent key addon and actually brings value to the broken keys. I used to bring broken keys into matches just so I can drop them on some random part of the map. Now I keep those bitches.
---
Don't give him attention. I commented below that this guy an hour ago was deleting and posting the same meme over and over again about how The Nightmare and Hillbilly need a nerf.
---
Umm yes thank you, this could make more people come to dbd and leave trash fortnite
---
Damn, I missed the stream, im gonna follow him now even though he will stream in another 1 thousand years
---
You did good, but you also sucked.
---
Hmmm yes these 4 emblems are 1 emblem
---
You want his 12 year old fan base to come play this game? There would be a rise in BMing for sure.
---
Can confirm got big banned
---
Yeah, ghost face is my go to for ez bloodpoints atm. I just got him, and having NOED and thrill of the hunt on his build makes him rain bloodpoints.
---
I'm a woman but yes that
---
VHS pffft what an inefficient way to experience porn. Clowns slacking, but that’s how he gets that nice flick, he lasts long

---

---
They were most likely swf
---
I don’t mind Legion. I like being able to keep playing the game and not getting chased then down right away. even though I need to mend it doesn’t take very long and i can usually go back to gens after. I had very nice Legions lately lol. Sorry I don’t have any tips, I play survivor, just thought you’d wanna know not everyone hates him :)
---
HE HAS A WIFE?????
---
That you the community made it
---
Looks oddly like a Fortnite skin
---
be funny , 
---
crap you don't have to be funny repost and steal memes.
---
There's a difference between "Not reading my mind" and "not understanding context."
---
I had a couple more ideas in the shower.
---
—————————
---
CALCULATED:
---
Unlocks potential in one's Aura-reading ability. 
---
While outside of the killer's terror radius, the killer's aura is revealed to you while another survivor is being chased. This effect persists 1/1.5/2 seconds after a chase ends.
---
*"Why don't we just wait here for a little while, see what happens?"*
---
DRAGON'S BREATH:
---
Even the face of death averts its eyes from you.
---
Blinding the killer with a flashlight will cause them to walk backwards for 1/1.5/2 seconds, or until the blind ends. The killer's field of view is locked in place for the duration.
---
*"WINDOWS, BLAST 'EM!"*
---
CUT TIES
---
The sacrifice of your friends fills you with urgency.
---
When a survivor is hooked, gain 20% repair speed and 10% movement speed. This effect is doubled if a survivor dies. Lasts for 6/8/10 seconds. Stacks.
---
*"We're not getting out of here alive. But neither is that thing."*
---
Nothing worse than solo survivor, out of 10 games, you'd get maybe atleast 1 decent match where everyone isn't completely braindead
---
Can't kill survivors if you ain't look cute. 😏
---
This is possibly the best and most helpful post I have ever seen on this subreddit, thank you.
---
Ok stoner
---
That's all good but where's my leaked plague offering
---
A joke that’s been beaten to death at this point
---
Ok..here goes nothing.
---
This gave me a real outside world chuckle. Thank you
---
All the campers I get just insta leave
---
Whats even more annoying is that bhvr actually fixed the issue, but refused to implement it because they want to balance the other challenges before releasing the bug fix.
---
I agree they should be somewhere around the map and the cosmetics you have should influence what they are
---
Free blood points
---
*OINK*
---
My advice for now: always aim for an endgame 3-gen. If 2 groups of 2 are rushing (doubling up) on opposite sides, let them have one of the gens for free while you interrupt the other 2. Prioritize giving them gens on one side of the map to shrink your patrol area. Don't let them split your patrol area up (where the gens are in two groups with a lot of space between them). Without slowdown, you need to play defensive. Defend a relatively small area of gens like your life depends on it, and, if things get desperate (e.g. all gens are powered or about to be powered) defend hooks.
---
You don't need Ruin, specifically, but you do need some kind of slowdown to play more aggressively, which is what most killers are better at. Unfortunately, all of Ruin, Pop and Corrupt are locked to specific DLC killers. You're not going to get to high ranks without one of them if youre playing an m1 killer. Sloppy Butcher/Thanataphobia/Dying Light can add some slowdown as well if you have a chance to grab one of them first, but they are highly killer/playstyle dependant. I would recommend picking up perks from the shrine when they become available. Sloppy Butcher is available to all killers right away and Thanataphobia is a Nurse perk so you can get it for free by spending BP on her.
---
Last note: as others have mentioned, LF is not a very good killer to begin with and he will struggle to succeed without a great set of perks and playstyle. Consider practicing with Billy or Huntress instead. They are both free and high tier. Training with Billy should also help you get a bit better at playing other killers as well, as good survivors will deny easy chainsaw downs and give you good m1 looping practice.
---
I don't even camp as killer and I'm so sick of survivors whining about camping. It's a game, they are playing to win, just like you. It's a strategy. It may suck but it is within the rules.
---
All killers can see scratch Marks.
---
All killers can see scratch marks
---
1/4 of a team being eliminated is VASTLY different from a decent gen slowdown perk being removed.
---
I'm saying that Killers merely being capable of winning sometimes doesn't meant they're balanced in general, even vs. one another, and that expanded into the fact that the game itself isn't balanced, and that the kill rate data is extremely fudgy. Basically, that not every killer is "viable" at red ranks, despite any of them being able to occasionally get that early kill-into-snowball. In general, weak Killers are going to get bullied.
---
And Beads is getting nerfed, and I'm pretty sure they removed Omegablink Nurse already.
---
Oh.. Maybe it's just something on his end or he doesn't pay much attention?
---
Legion can't while using their power, but that's it. Every killer can see them
---
I’m inclined to agree
---
Thanks boss
---
Do you mean emblems or Survivor Mains' opinion? Because in either case, stop doing well.
---
How is that the bigger man? Tf do u even mean? Killing survivors is his objective. So you're saying letting survivors live is being the bigger man? What logic is that.
---
Came for the salt. Stayed for the salt.
---
From experience shes nearly impossible to stun at pallets, for whatever reason i can never blind her no matter where i aim while shes breaking pallets. First time i tried against a spirit i thought they had lightborn on
---
That's why i keybinded the skill check on the mouse! That way i have a free hand!
---
DbD is a horror game.
---
Comedy achieved. Nea is also the entity.

Or when you know there is a trap but you still walk over it
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e4axjn/still_waiting_for_that_chick_leatherface_as_a/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I'm not a survivor main this was just form things survivor whine to that "I do". The survivor POV was because I thought people would connect with it. And although camping is a valid strategy, I dont condone it
---
Actually I do come across Iron Grasp a fair bit. Surprisingly more than Agitation, though I'd wager thats because some people dont wanna level Trapper, and they effectively let you travel the same distance while carrying
---
I just want you to know I appreciate the calculating you went through
---
For killer, it seems to be easy as long as it’s a match you can control, just try to hook each survivor three times and apply a lot of pressure without making the chases too long or too short. It sounds complicated but just try to apply pressure and get survivors to be altruistic the whole game then you’ll have an easy time getting max each game.
---
Yeah that's the downside of any key. Most people who play killer get super salty and petty over seeing one in the pre game lobby so there's a higher chance of Franklin's if there are other items in the mix. Broken keys are also good for baiting Franklin's which makes the killer waste a perk slot to begin with. They could have had a better perk but now they're gonna kick themselves in the ass when they see a green key with no addons at the end game after they lost. Or won. Whatever the case is.
---
I’m sorta the opposite I play killer when I get tired of being tunneled and face-camped
---
For like one day maybe.
---
It takes 800 xp to get 1 fragment, and 10 fragments to go up one tier.
---
Every single day, you can get 300 free xp for your first killer/survivor game of the day, so if you log in every day and play a handful of games on each side, you get lots of free tiers just from that.
---
The most important thing is doing the challenges, because they give you a lot of fragments at once. Those combined with the gameplay xp &amp; daily freebie while grinding challenges should get you there, or really close.
---
Yostoi? Bafanada!
---
It’s also not a fucking 4 o clock skill check
---
I would say only for an hour, like how restaurants have a happy hour
---
I dont believe it will appear on the shrine either
---
Having the objective be split between 3 other teammates really helps. As killer one mistake can set me back so far or even lose me the game. As survivor, it's a meh, just move on kinda scenario.
---
They're both the highest rarity so they must be good
---
It can as Franklin's is there right now. Just pretty annoyed I have to wait for it and it could be anywhere from next week to months from now.
---
Wait, can PC play with Console?
---
I played a lot of hours as a stressed killer. A LOT. It goes away, but only when you get really good at killer and begin to care a little less about the game. None of that is particularly helpful for you so I will leave you with this: to reduce stress as a killer make each game about trying a different build for fun - redefine success. Success no longer becomes killing as many survivors but it becomes pulling a survivor off a generator with fun spirit add ons and the right perks. There are so many creative builds and combos out there once you start unlocking killers perks on multiple killers. My success if finding a fun and unique build.
---
That's really wierd, they made Bill's perks default when ps4 couldnt get him.
---
Maybe they're planning on releasing them at some point
---
what’s the metal spoon lol
---
I also always thought it was a tiger up until the Oni release and then noticed and was midly surprised.
---
Booty Pics &lt; playing as Jane one-handed
---
I have never played swf and frequently make red ranks classes and work permitting.
---
To rank up you need to get higher medals, and in order to higher medals you need to do specific actions.
---
Altruism: heal others
---
Boldness: run the killer and do ballsy things
---
Objective: hens and doors
---
Survival: don't get downed or hooked, and escape
---
You have to do sufficiently well in each of these to earn enough "points" to pip. A general rule of thumb is as follows:
---
Do two gens, heal injured survivors whenever they come to you, loop the killer for another gen or two, break totems for any more boldness, open the door and escape.
---
After each game, look at your medals and see which one you can improve on. If you need to get better at running the killer, watch YouTube videos for running standard tiles.
---
It’s ranked mode is literally casual mode. Rank is pointless, literally you get the best players and the biggest potatoes all at red ranks. Such a huge skill difference between people in red ranks.  It’s not a competitive mode

---
I played a game as wraith and all the gens got done and I still got iridescent gatekeeper (I only remember this certain time because it was the first time I got four iridescent emblems)
---
Good catch but no, I stopped the clip right before I opened it though.
---
/r/DBDGoneGay will be fun for you. Doc is best boy
---
Lies, it's cock and ball torture
---
Wow, this is literally some of the worst advice you can give to other killer players.
---
So here's how I think this whole thing could work:
---
As soon as a player activates the challenge, that perk shows up at max level on any character that didn't already have it in their loadouts. As soon as the player completes that challenge, (read; completes, not cashes it) the perk is immediately removed from that list. This works especially great for perks that people tend to skip over. ~~cough cough Monstrous Shrine cough cough~~
---
The best part is that this could easily be worked for DLC perks too, and maybe even killers themselves! That way players can try the new stuff on their own terms before they actually commit! Sound good?
---
I broke 40 pallets by having my Internet commit die
---
Ask yourself why you are so uptight
---
Dominating would be &gt;75% since 3 survivors killed and thats equal to safety pip or pipping. Only ones close to that is Freddy, Billy and Spirit. Also we have no info of how many gens are done in said games so these stats are kind of useless..
---
While on the survivor end, DS needs many buffs and Deja Vu is the most meta and op perk
---
Billy is almost top 5, wtf you on?
---
Understandable have a nice day
---
Do people actually complain about deliverance and unbreakable? I get dead hard and ds but unbreakable?
---
2 min iirc.
---
Feel like people burned you down when you weren't necessarily wrong - definitely not every active player plays everybody, and absolutely most of the uptick we see during blood hunts are just active players clocking more playtime, but what I was trying to say was that when it's *that big of an uptick* I don't buy that it's an all hands on deck scenario, some of it is people who only boot up for hunts
---
For my own metrics I've got 15ish friends on Steam that play DBD, I'd say four or are steady, three are every couple weeks or so, five wait for events to play and the rest have quit
---
I saw a bit of his stream and he’s very toxic
---
it technically works, use the medkit and either you get borrowed time or if they wait it out you get healed. EZ big brain play
---
Mmm I'm not the one just being a dick on a subreddit for a cheap thrill. I mean really what more do you possibly gain from this other than just looking like a clown.
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
I think he's only playing it because of his wife and hexy
---
Mainly for the tbag, it's nice to turn the tables for once.
---
My god, they are so braindead
---
I’m really sick of everyone running the same perks. Nothing but Slippery meat, Calm Spirit, Sole Survivor and Vigil
---
They'd get stuck in a wall knowing BHVR lol
---
Right? But people who run No Mother, Self Care, Solidarity, and Second Wind deserved to be banned. It's such an op build
---
Isnt it crazy you can mathematically demonstrate why 90% of killers cant win and people still think this game is killer sided somehow
---
This is really good!
---
It says in his character info, "Sabotaged bear-traps automatically respawn after 3 minutes."
---
what? are you talking about who would escape a trial? i guess laurie?
---
Thank you!
---
The Steves look at Nancy like "The fuck you doing gtfo"
---
He's the only killer able to really tbag (fuck off pig you slow-ass sow) so he's basically a walking shitpost ready to happen.
---
Every time I unhook someone against a hag and they run immediately after
---
Learn to adapt to three gens popping in the first two and a half minutes lmfao okay bud
---
So you Click BaTiEd mE
---
Oh boy, as someone who downloaded this game like 4 days ago... Michael can go fuck himself lol
---
Oh for sure, I'm not calling for a nerf at all, I'm just saying the survivors have taken a lot of nerfs lately and it's ruining their side too.
---
I don't know any more. Maybe it wasn't, maybe the Devs lied about their system, I really hope they did because I want to believe that killers don't need a 4k to win
---
Hahah foney face gottem
---
I'd like to get behind ghost face
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if they were wrong, I mean it is BHVR we’re talking about lol
---
Bonk best boy i want him to pound me
---
Why does it run so poorly on pc?
---
Removing unskillful free hits and giving her a mechanic that requires more skill than having headphones or randomly bumping into people is always welcome in my book
---
Kids play every game but theres less now than there will be if ninja popularises this
---
Billy is the model of balance. God killer, and my Dad. Buff his ass, make them suffer.
---
It's because crappy teammates MAKE it killer sided. I hade a game against an amazing nurse the other day, I managed to avoid her in a chase for a minute and a half, before the chase I 99'd a gen and 3 others had popped... 2 minutes, 3 hooks and 2 farming idiots later and I depipped without any more gens popping. If I hadn't been in the killers shoes so often, I would totally think the game was killer sided.
---
New Survivor buff?
---
Rank 4 vs 11, not worst. Only the highest ranked survivor’s rank counts. The rank 20 is SWF with someone
---
I had 4 matches in a row as rank 3 survivor against rank 15 killer yesterday
---
6 rank radius my ass BHVR
---
Why say lot word when few word do trick?
---
Uuuuhhhhh, that's an amazing idea!!
---
Legit dbd Dad.
---
Hail Bill
---
That's what happens when they have 3 platforms to manage. Gotta get a patch readied and accepted by all 3 platforms. Most developers would rather just push it in with a bunch of shit to avoid it.
---
Ghostface is one of my faves to play and I had a match today where a Bill did this to me. I dragged him to the door and called him a crazy b\*tch and we had a good laugh. :)
---
Its gonna hurt newer spirits but buff good spirits.  she'll have to rely even more on sound so she can go behind the survivor to hit them without stun which she couldn't do before and risked coming out of phase too early. Randomly bumping into people was annoying as shit even as someone that played her, didn't use it much and the only times it happened was at pallets when I knew they were there. If i wasnt bodyblocked I wouldn't of gotten stunned at that pallet since they cant move either. Its more reaction time at this point though. The BS part was just phasing and hitting someone randomly. That was dumb. I would rather her showing the phase animation though but oh well
---
Why say word when trick?
---
Playing killer to jumpscare with Myers
---
Community tier list have set standards with less variables than those raw numbers
---
Haven’t even played since the plague was released because this game is too broken....
---
The BS part was that she’s a mind game killer that wins mind games for free.
---
What you described here is not something free, so I’m fine with it.
---
I’m still unhappy with the changes, cuz she still knows your exact location when you’re injured and all you can do is hope you are on the right side of the window or run iron will just in case you happen to run into spirit
---
They should just fix anal beads, remove collision on phase and reduced injured sounds to 0 or 50%, or make them non-directional during phasing
---
Yeah Last Minute Hero is very situational
---
Hey now, keep things civil, we all have 0 terror radius here
---
Me_irl used to be a sub that focused on self deprecating humor because a lot of redditors are self loathing. (Thus the name “Me in real life” )
---
2meirl4meirl ( too me_irl for me_irl ) are the posts that are self deprecating AND downright depressing (but still relatable for many people) ... but too heavy and “real” for the meme sub that me_irl is these days
---
r/thingsthatdidnthappen
---
I would love this
---
Whats your username?
---
Prime example of why I like to play him every now and then. Doing stuff like this always brings a smile to my face
---
An all time classic.
---
They already kinda killed beads, removing collision is fine as I said just gonna make better spirits even more bs to play against imo and reducing injured sounds would make stridor needed 100% of the time and none of us want that. Also non-directional wouldn't do much but make duration addons better since she still could locate how loud it is depending on where she is. An animation to her phase would be nice since if you used it your animation would show and you couldn't use it for a little bit. Maybe even give it an higher CD if you don't use it completely to punish misusing her power (?). But yeah atm iron will/spine chill are both great perks to run against spirit (spine chill even more since its great against all killers) but in the end it depends on your playstyle
---
 You missed the post , e.g at a pallet if you stand in it she can go through you, but you can go through her, so it’s 50/50 still, whereas before she’s 100% get a hit if she collided with you and you don’t notice.
---
Ghostface is absolutely fantastic. Him and Piggy are probably my favorite killers so far.
---
My username (Xbox) is CrispyChicken4U
---
I want stridor to not do anything to her phasing. She can mindgame for one hit and hear steps. I hate that her second hit is free. I play her a lot so I’m not just a salty survivor bashing her
---
This is why I bound the skillcheck buttons to the side buttons on my mouse. Except I fail them anyway.
---
As killer if you take 1 hand to scratch your nose then all 4 survivors already escaped.
---
Nerf this
---
I get mostly 4ks as legion so
---
I cannot count how many times as soon as I let go of R1 the skill check sound starts and the gen blows. 
---
Also when I'm healing with a medkit 7/10 times when the medkit runs out before I'm done healing a skill check happens and I am forced to fail it
---
No, I know. The thing is, if she hears you on one side she can go through you immediately instead if going around you maybe try and surprise you to down you but she risks leaving phase early. Now she can just go through you, cancel phase and hit you immediately and get a pretty guaranteed hit. Gonna make better spirits that dony rely on collision to do better and worse spirits to do even worse
---
They get far more points for escaping than one hook. You are also improving the health of the community by not retaliating toxicity with smugness. I'd rather let somebody else have more fun than upset somebody because they "deserve it" over my own internal ego problem.
---
This is sweet as hell! It'd make a friggin awesome print!!
---
And Cloaxy.  He actually plays a little.
---
YES YES YES YES I CAN FINALLY USE HIM AGAIN
---
When I'm farming I always give them a chase and a hook.  
---
No point on letting them having it easy.
---
May you get a permaban for your DC.

Worst nightmare would be a team of 4 Claudettes. I just played against one about 2 hours ago and it was 15 minutes I’m never going to get back. Ran into them in lobby three times after that so I just stopped playing.
---
1000% yes
---
I've literally bumped into a survivor one time while playing Spirit, and that one time, I unphased and couldnt find the person after. I'm pretty confident if I hadn't bumped into the person, I would have continued on my path and unphased at a better time, and got the hit off.

So I agree. This will be a buff.

What does sabotaging actually do?
---
“when you use balanced landing”
---
I main killer and I end up losing survivors in chases many, many times.
---
Why? It’s very simple. I’m still a baby killer and it’s so easy to get away from me. I usually laugh at myself (while being still frustrated, too) when that happens.
---
I'm the opposite. I play killer to relax from shitty survivor games.
---
Isn’t he already dead before the picture? He saw the light, that’s the smile of heaven.
---
Aww hecc, now this just straight up made my day!
---
Selling physical merch is kinda spooky with these shipping prices, but I'll definitely venture into that sometime! :)
---
I think no0b is a good player and content creator but I think his content appeals more to teenagers and that’s why he has a larger audience. It isn’t a bad thing but ya know.
---
Oh sorry, I didnt mean it at you specifically. I just never understood why hes so popular compared to other DBD content creators. Also I'm a little toasted so I'm questioning alot of things.
---
What console? Because a Myers was just in my lobby and did that
---
Wiggling is rewarded with bloodpoints. As you said, the point of wiggling is to prevent being taken to a tactically strong hook every time, like the basement. The game isn't balanced around someone wiggling off every other time you pick them up, and wiggling off is really never meant to happen without outside assistance like saboutaging or bodyblocking.
---
I should watch him one day. Btw which stream did you end up watching?
---
I had a game like this today. Was very unplayable. But I stuck it through and got a pity escape
---
I can't imagine they'll delve into perk sets that aren't effectively free. The grind is all a part of the game, and the Archive is meant to tempt you to try things you haven't or haven't tried in a while. Most folks won't sit on the same challenge for Brutal Strength.
---

You didn't even reply directly to them.

Yep. I believe it’s something with your strong hand clicking the button on your mouse. Or maybe you have to press the space button farther in so it is tougher.

This one is striking, exceptional work

Just know that people that okay like this aren’t in higher ranks (unless you lies a killer off). The game rewards three hooks way more then one hook death. They can’t pip up with this play style.
---
Thank you so so much
---
Oh dang, you're right. My b.
---
Both but mainly survivor (red rank; Killer yellow rank). I swear there's only like 4 players that play killer in high rank in my area bc they're all I see
---
i only said why they do that! I never said disconnecting is fine. You all thought of that maybe because is that what you all would do!
---
Wow kinda didn't see. Ok listen man at the moment most perks are better than self care just look for a perk that well allow you to see your friends

Platform: ps4

When the last survivor is left alive and the hatch is open, it appears to be closed and makes no sound but can still be interacted with: closed or escaped into. This only happens on the killer end apparently

Weird. I mainly play killer but I only play survivor when my sister wants to play, but I do enjoy some solo games. I am like green on PC but on Switch I am just starting. I hope they introduce crossplay soon. I don't feel like grinding for my shit again and from the way it sounds from your post, the player base is pretty low too.

---
Only basic attacks count toward gaining stacks. Ambush attack by pig, shred by demo, picking up a survivor in a bear trap by trapper, grabbing your obsession, corrupt purge by plague, and hatchets by huntress will not remove STBFL stacks. I’m not sure about chainsaws but people have said that stacks have been removed if you down the obsession with a chainsaw.

---
Has happened to me twice within one week now. Ran right next to it without knowing because i expected sound... could have closed it but ended up not finding it, only for the survivor to get a free escape.
---
The biggest issue has always been for survivor not killers. Killer already receive a dc bonus, survivors just receive a death.
---
I used to get really salty at this game but I did two things. As survivor, I made being the reason why another teammate survived or lived longer count as a win in my head. My friend is like why am I always living and you die and its cause as long as he can live because of me. For killer its tougher but I look at 2 wins being a pretty good game, 3 kills as a win and I usually give hatch. When people are toxic or sandbags a teammate though, they get tunneled because if I'm not toxic you shouldn't be. The one thing I still complain about is dcing cause its pussy but other than that the mindset is everything
---
Yeah people who do this, just dont play the game. No one likes you.
---
Killers just want a perk that allows us to pass-through survivors and we are good.  
---
Survivors, just want to have to 10 generators total.

It is a fair trade and I will allow it.

&gt;TL;DR: this games only mode is ranked but then tries to appeal to casuals. Its confusing as fuck because it nerfs killers like nurse that are only strong in the hands of very skilled players but then ignores powerful tools abused by SWFs because average solo queue green ranks dont play optimally enough to get the full power of these tools. So like which is it BHVR, we balancing around high level and looking at the potential for something to be broken at super high level or are we trying to make the game fun for potatoes? Cuz youre trying to do both and thats not how it works.
---
They are balancing the game towards fun (even if they are failing at it, this is the goal) since "super high level" barely exists considering reaching rank 1 is effortless and doesn't reflect skill in the slightest. Not only that, reaching "top ranks" is becoming easier with each update while BHVR tries to fix queue times by increasing the player pool in higher ranks (which will inevitably cause a problem for players at rank 20 ~ 15). 
---
Rank in DBD is merely an excuse for a failed attempt of matchmaking to separate brand new players from veterans.
---
The thing is it's still really good without that. Balanced landing's strength is that it creates safe zones, it turns previously dangerous areas into places where space can be generated. Before nerf it could turn those areas into outright loopable areas, often much safer than normal loops, and I can understand why that would be changed.
---
stop trying to escape them. instead learn to waste their time. become good enough at it and they will just piss off on their own after a bit
---
Although I do agree with your point that there is a bit of misunderstanding on what kind of players the devs are catering towards, I do believe they have made some effort to balance to higher level play by removing things that where straight out broken.
---
For example the nerf to insta-heals was a very powerful tool survivors could use to extend a chase without requiring any skill. 
---
Balanced Landing nerf was BHVR attempt to balance maps such as Haddonfield that usually higher skilled players would abuse.
---
The spirit nerf was done because despite being really strong, she did not have a significant learning curve if compared to the nurse. 
---
The nurse nerf was a bit debatable. I do think they went a bit hard on her but it was done to limit her potential since she is unstoppable if a talented enough player uses her. Nerfing her add-ons prevented builds such as the Omega nurse or 5 blink nurses that made her Op or reduced her skill gap.
---
Other than this I do agree. I think the issue might be that the Devs all have different perspectives on what is balanced in a game. 
---
Comparing the balancing of Legion to Freddy.
---
Legion being arguably the worst killer in dbd having nerfs thrown into his power and buffing borrowed time, one of the strongest effects and perks a survivor has. 
---
Freddy rework pulled him from being a poor killer to being one of the strongest killers in the game.
---
Ps4
---
Made me laugh out loud, take my upvote
---
So what happens when we get through all the free characters (Nurse, Huntress, Wraith, Billy, Trapper) and end up at Spirit, Legion, or Clown?
---
I think it would be rather foolish to think that the Trials aren't going to last that long so long as the game keeps chugging along.
---
Can...can we just mass upvote this post? Hope and pray that BHVR sees it and actually considers it. It's not an impossible feature. In Identity V, there's a few hunters that have features like this, and since they won't actually be controllable, I don't think it would be too complicated for them to implement.
---
I cant wait for people to fuck over their team at least a little less. People who dc ruin 20 percent of my games every night. Just dont play.

Just lvl him up and practice! Also try watching some people on YouTube playing it. 
---
I watch alot of monto and puppers and learned how to loop by just watching them! I'm still not amazing at it but I'm slowly getting better!
---
Damn, thank you. Just what I needed. Also good to know that I'm a LOT more careless as survivor than I thought. 😂
---
Dedicated servers, gotta love'm
---
I became the very thing I've sworn to kill
---
I bought Dead by daylight so I could KILL as a scary KILLER
---
But killers aren't scary in this game. They are not a threat, unless your teammates make mistakes. And that's...painful.
---
I cried a lot from stress when those toxic, more experienced survivors started to bully me. I knew nothing about the game, so that's when I noticed the matchmaking is shit.
---
I did get better, yes, but whenever I click "ready" on killer lobby, my body fills with anxiety. I know I am not ready. How can I ever be ready? It's 1v4. And I don't feel like I am 4x stronger than those pesky survivors. 
---
And then, I finally hopped into survivor gameplay for those freaking archives missions. And I didn't expect to have FUN. I laughed and rolled my eyes when my teammates made mistakes. I laughed harder when the killer made mistakes. And even more when I made mistakes. It's fun. I am not alone against a enemy. There's a team backing me up. 
---
Maybe that's the reason it's stressful? You are all alone. It's not the Survivors fighting against you. It's you, the killer, fighting against the survivors.
---
Meh, or maybe I'm just a baby killer, too whiny for his own good xD
---
It's free real estate.

---
While you're not wrong, i was thinking of this from a developer standpoint. Making perks temporarily free is a great way for new players to experience the game, especially for non-character specific perks. Adding on the DLC later means that more players would be willing to buy it because they have an idea of what they're actually getting.
---
Besides, there's no reason this would actually harm anybody in general. Worst case scenario is it makes the archives slightly shorter gametime wise, which is a much better outcome then spending millions upon millions of bloodpoints looking for one specific perk you might not ever see quickly.
---
Hi, welcome to a 5 month old post, what are you doing here? Also not being able to recognize blatant satire is worse than a woosh.

What does it say
---
Glad I could help. I used to be super immersed, but you don’t get a lot of bloodpoints doing that and when you are discovered you’re basically a free sacrifice.
---
It’s BHVR, there’s no way haha
---
Something you should do is to not sabotage them completely! 
---
The killer knows when you fully sabotage them! Leave them 99% then when the killer is close start to pop all the hooks!

Sometimes I think he doesn't even understand when a surv wants to have fun. Like when a survivor starts meming, he's like "they just want to die?"
---
Nea with oink hair: 100% toxic
---
Jeffs sucks
---
Feng are either fun/experienced or toxic/experienced
---
Learn to drop sooner on Fred.  His model is smaller, yet hitbox for weapons/lunge is still the same, making him feel like stretch armstrong.
---
I wish he was a more fun having type of dude.i can respect the competitive side of him, but it’s CONSTANT. Still like the content tho.
---
I'll confess something here guys.
---
Yesterday was my first DC that has nothing to do with the game kicking me out.
---
I left when I realized that I got a round against ghostface for the fifths time in a row :D
---
Super relevant user name
---
Only time camping doesn't make you a dick
---
That’s how DBD used to be but thankfully the devs have moved away from that (aside from the annoying PTBs)
---
The hardest decisions require the strongest wills.
---
Nea with Pink Hair: Tries to be toxic but goes down instantly
---
Bill and David: Either a baby or a god at looping. No inbetween
---
Kate: Has Dead Hard 100% of the time
---
Jake: Very toxic and good at looping
---
It's nice to encounter friendly Killers every now and then. And since I main Ghost Toast I love being able to tbag with my fellow Survivors.
---
I mean ash probably would’ve gotten out if he didn’t have mad grit
---
Or underneath the map.
---
I always try taking hits for teammates. It’s actually a very good strategy
---
Add them together = the total of players. Seriously why does finding games take so long!
---
It’s my last challenge to complete so it’s now the slow grind
---
Usually it seems when the killer brings one is too balance out slugging and of hooks. That's usually been my experience.
---
True story: I played plague and prestige her once before realizing you can absorb the pools of corruption at any time, I always thought it was a timed thing or if enough people cleansed it happened
---
Could just be a coincidence. Used a few envelopes recently and my games have been fine or good
---
This doesnt really change much though, this is just extending gens which is the change people generally want to avoid.
---
Think about it, you have to get 3 parts mostly by yourself if you are not swf, then you have to put them in, THEN you start working on the gen. That would be 2+ mins for a single gen.
---
Survivors need another objective that doesnt relate to gens but is more important then totems. If this was implemented i would DC against every forever freddy and plague since im already on the edge with those 2.
---
If it glows, it goes.
---
I love the legion weapons too because they remind me of my csgo days and always wanting a knife skin
---
Also hoodie Susie is fire
---
Okay, but hear me out...
---
She’s THICC.
---
8 hooks &gt; 4
---
Imagine how I was feeling when I suddenly rubberband into Myers lunging me then got hit with NOED. Fortunately + suprisely he didn’t facecamp me but I was fucking pissed
---
Its not the will of BHVR... they want us to basement camp for challenges and tunnel survivor to get shit done good killers choose to not do it and lose out on points etc so survivor have fun....
---
This almost feels like another horror game out there that isn't as big of success as DBD...
---
probably last reply here cause this feels like it's getting a little long in the tooth but you actually said something I really agree with and I think really sums up what I'm trying to express,
---
I'd say about half of the fifteen people I mentioned are IRL friends I introduced to the game and very few of them have hung on, and mainly not because of the grind, but because of perks specifically
---
I feel like I've experienced the same Discord conversation of "why can't I ____?" and then explaining they don't have the perk and that in order to get the perk they need to switch characters, grind levels on that character until near cap, then switch back and grind levels for RNG to drop the perk they earned, and getting their response of "....oh" and usually them leaving the session a few games later
---
I think once casual players find out that in order to sprint/heal/dodge/fight back when picked up/get back up/etc that they're going to have to earn an amount of points that the game just doesn't seem willing to dole out reasonably, they tend to tap out - but when I tell those same players it's double points, they almost always join back up for a few matches, even after months of inactivity
---
So I think you said it best, casual players needing access to better perks is definitely one of the root motivators, but also one of the root issues
---
I for example have League of Legends in my list even though I am not playing it anymore. Subnautica, Wow as well. So I can totally understand him.
---
Pshh, my favorite movie is SpaceBalls. *Youve probably never heard of it before, hmph.*
---
I was paired with 2 green ranks and a yellow rank survivor, when I’m in red. The killer was green, but one of my teammates just suicided. It’s just as bad when it happens as survivor too. What is the point of a ranking system then ?
---
I did mine in farming game with a guy who played trapper just to get his challenge done. Lucky me.
---
I thought you have Mori on the Meg
---
This is why I’m Sharp Ace.
---
Probably just gone. Just guessing.
---
Honestly I am stuck at this! I did 4/5, and played all yesterday to get that 1 but still, and I’m still playing, i hope I get it this game! (Im on Reddit while looking for a game xD)
---
I ran into a death squad of these. I could barely get 1 kill.
---
2 weeks after the rift is gone they're gone.
---
Never trust a ghostface, ill trust a bubba before i trust a ghostface.
---
An all time classic
---
Corrupt Intervention is exactly that
---
I’m pretty sure he’s aware that he’s not good at the game.
---
To be fair, he’s just being toxic when he calls people trash, I doubt he’s actually serious. There were some times in his stream that were pretty sus, even hexy agreed sometimes.
---
Hexy said he got banned for mori spamming, and ninja got mori spammed but didn’t really say much about it. Another incident happened where hexy was hiding in a locker after the 3rd person was killed (hexy last one alive) and the killer goes straight to the locker hexy was hiding in and pulls him out.
---
It’s nearly possible to say for sure that someone’s stream sniping unless they admit it post game, but there were some really sus killers on stream
---
Aw, dang, I bought stuff too early, now I kinda wasted mine. Oops. Thank you though!
---
If you woudl have said rank 1, I could agree...  
---
But you where just getting greedy, you don't deserve to be lazy and get rank 3 perks for free! Even if only for a limited time!
---
You bought every single skin? Even last year’s?
---
*everybody disliked that*
---
Hmmm
---
God damn it why did I laugh
---
These changes still aren't live on PS4 for me...
---
I don't see anything toxic in this image...
---
I'm talking about me, I went toxic AF, and they chose the perks they saw fit.
---
Ya same
---
I mean, no one sees him as a god. No0b3 is fun to watch if you just want to lay back and relax with non sweaty survivor plays. His YouTube content is enjoyable to watch too. Plus he has a very nice voice

Tbh , legion needs a total rework like Freddy . His power isn’t the best and that DS stun to get out of your power is really stupid. Now that his hits don’t count as stbfl or sloppy he’s more useless . He’s like old Freddy . The concept was great but the power isn’t really efficient or good at high ranks.his frenzy idea is amazing but I would suggest it did something else that’ll help in gen pressure and chase .
---
I heard they removed that along with the donkey jacket and some others
---
&gt;I'm talking about me, I went toxic AF, and they chose the perks they saw fit.
---
So you are bragging about using a Mori? Edgy.
---
Rank doesn’t matter, rank just shows how much time you played the game in a month. Almost everyone can get to rank 1 easily

I think mostly so... I define a M1 killer as a killer with no proper gap closing abilities / ranged attacks / insta-downs so Trapper, Wraith, Doctor, Plague (if you don't cleanse)etc.. I don't count Pig's ambush as a gap closer because of the time lost getting into position to hit a survivor, and it is very easily avoidable. The Jigsaw boxes / reverse  bear traps are irrelevant because you need to down the survivor first so they don't help in the chase, they are only change the survivor's priorities for completing genies to removing the headpiece. The chase it the biggest thing that defines what a killer is. So Pig's playstyle is mostly hold down W and click M1, maybe try and mindgame a pallet with ambush, that is about it... She is a m1 killer in my opinion.
---
Spirit: Prayer Beads
---
Legion: NOTHING
---
Prayer beads at least till they get changed mind that lul
---
Yes mister legion, i would like 1 drug please
---
Just don't god loop.
---
Just don't bm at the gates.
---
otoh, someone bms me after dropping a pallet or something I'll camp em right there from hook 1 and give the others a fun game.
---
I didn’t figure your way. But i did go to Friends &gt; now playing &gt; (the game session I’m at) &gt; the players appeared there
---
4 mori 4 hook &gt; 8 hooks &gt; 4 hook

If they are awesome hitting Great Skillchecks Ruin legit is perfect. Because with Ruin they don't get that 2% extra progress
---
The "late" aspect of it was kinda why I answered...
---
The Meg crawling into frame halfway through the video killed me
---
Hold ps button for the quick menu, it's 2-3 spots under close application then what I mentioned
---
Camping is technically a strategy it isnt fun for either side but you should always just do generators to punish campers. When the new killer comes out it'll be worse since his power encourages slugging survivors unless they change him but I doubt it. I'd level up bill for unbreakable if you haven't already.
---
Hell yea wiped my booty with them
---
I need to know how you made this masterpiece
---
New tome 4 challenge: get 5 iridescent emblems in one trial
---
Maybe there will be fewer camper/tunnelers, but that will only be because everyone is slugging.
---
I do find survivor to be more relaxing but also frustrating in a different way than killer.
---
😂👍🏻
---
Lately it’s been because of the Rift/Archive stuff. Also lower ranks tend to do that more too (but it’s not limited to them either)
---
this made me laugh so fucking hard
---
Me and my friend called it the pig tree for a long time. Its not so long ago we realized there aren’t even any pigs hanging from the tree
---
A true hero
---
This is dope af.
---
yeah how the fuck does this happen, I was winning and got disconnected too
---
But it still makes most survivors see you as a dick.
---
I have been playing for a solid year and i swear ive never fought plague ONCE. But to be fair im a killer main
---
Just to be certain by camping/tunnelling you mean basically facecamping then straight up tunnel off hook? Just clarifying so people can't say the killer just came back to the hook and spotted the injured surv first
---
Can you stop posting this image? This is the third time now.
---
No mither to counter plague boom
---
You think that Daily Rituals aren't tied to specific characters? https://i.redd.it/zso4p00odc631.jpg
---
The Tomes and Archives are not "events" whatsoever. They are an ongoing mechanic that will be around permanently and consistently.
---
Also, my original comment said that the challenges haven't been behind paywalls.
---
Also, the devs said that the tomes will probably have differing challenges based on the platform. Which is most likely referring to different platforms having different free characters.
---
All I said was that it would be a first since no dailys, challenges, "events", or gameplay at all has required anyone to buy DLC to participate. I'm not saying it won't happen, I'm just saying there is no evidence that they will.
---
I’m a bit embarrassed for you here, buddy. Getting the lowest score possible in a 3k to “own” the higher ranks? Gee, you sure showed em.
---
I can't wait till the fifth Claudette/Trapper Tome instead of ever getting a Jeff/Legion Tome.
---
claudettewasalone,soalone, intensifies.
---
gotta get that sweet sweet attention, too bad it's working especially with that shit picture
---
Which rank?
---
I didn't know last year's are included! Awesome, thanks a lot!
---
Well, it was just a joke. I'm just saying that you used a "facts" meme to state an opinion. I think maybe this meme template may have been more appropriate. https://i.redd.it/w05a1zd3nu141.png but with something like: "you don't have the tier 3 perks unlocked to do the archives with."
---
Survivors never accept their fate then I catch them in a corner as trapper they always wait till I leave if I cant place a trap underneath them :,(
---
The game I just did, it was a leatherface, sat there staring ate on the hook, and then chased me when I actually got rescued, then facecampers me again. Sick of shitty ass killers like this.
---
Prepare to get down voted by the killer mains who are convinced survivors are the only toxic ones.
---
what platform?
---
When survivors DC do they cause the game to end? I keep getting told I lost connect to host but Im the killer..
---
Oh, I know. Killer mains can't stand the idea that they are just as toxic in this game.
---
&gt;Camping killers need a bigger punishment than losing a few bloodpoints.
---
They don't lose bloodpoints, they just don't earn as much as they would by playing "normally".
---
What they do lose are emblem points which are pretty negligible. The biggest punishment must come from survivors by doing generators and giving him 2 kill at the most.
---
9
---
Thats what it said? Now its changed to \*eta to be announced.\* Guess they failed to get it to work in time
---
&gt; Leather face is the weakest killer, with no pressure or speed around the map...

Camping is not toxic... If anything, just boring / frustrating. With all the changes made to Emblems camping is not even viable anymore.
---
Thanks, teach!
---
Which isn't a punishment either. 
---
Hey, let's ruin the game for this guy on the hook so he has no fun, but it's ok, cause I don't get to kill everyone this game.
---
Ghostface doesn't need "right hands", at worst, he is m1 killer with no terror radius, with occasional one shot
---
Ahah. I never took survivor seriously to begin with. And now what ? Im a rank 4 survivor, im the pain in the ass of the team for the killer, can't be catched, can't be found, ruin gets destroyed early (or haunted grounds but heck its the **thrill** of it). And I pip and pip and pip again
---
Oh shit. Usually when I hear "camping" the first thing that comes to mind is 20 rank baby killers, who just want to have a kill.
---
I mean, camping is a waste of time.
---
You play  SWF?
---
Reminds me of Nioh 2 poster
---
Camping ruins the game for other players. So yeah, it's toxic.
---
Ranks really don't mean much. I've been rinsed by all rank 13s before but poo poo'd on all red ranks. It completely depends on the survivors if they decide to take the game seriously or not.
---
&gt;Which isn't a punishment either. Hey, let's ruin the game for this guy on the hook so he has no fun, but it's ok, cause I don't get to kill everyone this game.
---
I mean... its 2 minutes and you are off to the next match with hopefully a non camping killer.
---
They can make Tomes for all the characters and just make the challenges non-character specific. The tome can just be themed and have challenges that those characters would be good at instead of forcing you to play those characters. Did you actually play Claudette for the Botany Knowledge and Self Care challenges? Those perks were up on the shrine within the last month where anyone could get them with shards and not have to grind for them.
---
Yes.. This is just complete yessness
---
&gt;Camping ruins the game for other players. So yeah, it's toxic.
---
Camping means free escape for survivors. A boring escape but still escape nonetheless.
---
Yeah. We had a full squad. It all 3 to get me down, and then instead of going for any of them, he followed just me and got me on the hook again to camp.
---
2 minutes of sitting on a hook, and another 15 waiting for another match. Adding the 15 it takes to get into a match means I now have to wait in the slight hopes of getting a non camper killer.
---
There you are. Killer main who justifies camping and tunnelling. I bet you think survivors looping or merely running away is toxic, whereas everything you do is saintly.
---
I know your type. Gets looped more than 5 seconds, so proceeds to face camp because that survivor was so 'toxic'. Ironic that you don't realise you're the toxic one.
---
those cells are for the next rift. pay for 1 rift pay for them all (cost a little extra if you dont complete it). All the complete in 1 trial missions are fine, even if it takes me 10 matches to get it. But if it takes me 10 matches to complete "earn 200 000 bloodpoints" thats just artificially inflating the time to complete it.
---
This again...
---
- No one has the right to dictate how another person plays the game.
---
- Your opponent trying to win is not toxicity, it's the main aspect of a versus game. If you think your opponent trying to win is toxic, go play a PvE game.
---
And it still ruins it for one of the players. It's still toxic. Just because someone else escapes the match doesn't mean the killer didn't ruin the experience for the player that is being camped.
---
All the female survivors are a lot louder than the males but it's kind of a trade off because female survivors are tiny and can fit under grass and stuff
---
Just press triangle again to restart the search
---
&gt; There you are. Killer main who justifies camping and tunnelling. I bet you think survivors looping or merely running away is toxic, whereas everything you do is saintly.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I know your type. Gets looped more than 5 seconds, so proceeds to face camp because that survivor was so 'toxic'. Ironic that you don't realise you're the toxic one.
---
I am not a killer main... just a veteran player who understands the pros and cons of camping alongside all the counter plays there are for it. Not going to address the rest of your comment cuz its wild speculation that doesn't even need an answer.
---
I have never been in green ranks, but I get the impression that they're one of the most toxic people. Desperate to get to purple ones, thinking, they're gods etc. I feel bad for you man, camping killer is worse then ebony mori in my opinion, cause you have no fun at all. How often does it happen? Like, how often do you go against camping killers?
---
Yeah none of my friends play DBD so I always go solo. There's definitely some bad matches but most of the time I feel like the team is trying to play together.
---
Have you not been paying attention to the "Survive a Trial as Claudette" or "Catch 5 Survivors in Bear Traps in a single trial" challenges?
---
We're definitely going to see stuff like "Blink and hit a Survivor 15 times" or "In the Post Phase state, down 5 survivors" when it comes time for their challenges.
---
Yes, I did use Claudette for the Botany Knowledge and Self Care challenges. I hadn't leveled up Claudette yet so I didn't have her perks. It's no one's fault but their own if they don't have Spirit unlocked by the time the Tome comes around, because you can bet your ass there's going to be challenges both on playing Spirit and on using her perks.
---
Seems in character, as the movies were(supposed to be. I only watched the first) semi-humorous.
---
Im using call spirit on him so I don’t have to hear him
---
Me af omg 😂😂😂😂
---
you dont have to use the keys. I know if you bring one in and leave it it counts, not sure if you pick it up and drop it. worth a test
---
&gt;And it still ruins it for one of the players. It's still toxic. Just because someone else escapes the match doesn't mean the killer didn't ruin the experience for the player that is being camped.
---
Like I said in another reply, ruins the experience for a whole 2 minutes...
---
They can peace out in a random corner and won't be used as a fountain of boldness points with the survivors running around him.
---
Camping ruins the experience of the game for the person on the hook, especially when we have to wait almost 15 minutes for a match, only to have some asshole camp and tunnel. That's being toxic. And camping a single person is not "trying to win the game". It's camping. Something considered a shitty behavior in almost any pvp game.
---
😂😂 ikr
---
Doesn’t cause the game to end. Only way the game should end is if they all dc. Either that or Unless a survivor disconnects b4 the match starts.
---
Which generators get blocked is RNG. They could either be crucial or useless.
---
A lot since the tier 3 challenges. Nearly every match. Unless it's a ghostface. They never seem to camp.
---
&gt;2 minutes of sitting on a hook, and another 15 waiting for another match. Adding the 15 it takes to get into a match means I now have to wait in the slight hopes of getting a non camper killer.
---
I had a feeling you were going to reply like this... Survivor queues often are not 15 minutes long...
---

---
I was just saying that they've never done that before and there are ways around forcing people to buy DLCs, that's all.
---
I have a controversial idea, How about after a quick game the losing side deranks and the winning side ranks up so both teams can face equal opponents and have a good long close game?
---
My favorite is than, spirit fury, enduring, and then the last one I switch out between sloppy butcher and bloodhound. 😊
---
I had the same thought ...... lol
---
Good idea! Hey while we are at it why dont we punish looping? Becuase getting looped is not fun for the killer so survivors should get punished for it.
---
Oh yeah! Got it! Thank you so much!
---
You should try it now and see how it goes, and after the rework you should use nemesis or beast of prey in stead of sloppy since they’ll need to mend before they heal and BoP or nemesis are for the mending
---
Toxic is the purposeful targeting of a single person. If they target you because of who you are, that's toxic. If they target you because you were the first person they caught, that's bad luck. If they use you as bait to further catch more people, that's not toxic either, that's just the strategy they're using to win.
---
Just because you don't have a good time doesn't mean your opponent is toxic. Zero-sum fun is the sad aspect of versus games that many people can't seem to wrap they heads around.
---
Camping is considered a shitty behavior by shitty players. It doesn't mean it's not a strategy aimed to try and win the game. Setting up bait and using it to further your objective is literally a tactic to try and win the game.
---
Again, your opponent trying to win is not toxicity, it's the main aspect of a versus game. It's like saying "Survivors rushing to complete all 5 generators as fast as possible ruins the killer's fun, so that's toxic!"
---
See how absurd that sounds?
---
See how absurd you sound when you keep bitching about the same thing over and over?
---
Remember, if you're trying to argue against my neutral points, you're arguing against yourself. If you think you get to dictate how Killers play because you don't have fun, then Killers get to dictate how **YOU** play because they don't have fun. If you think your opponent trying to win is toxic, then **YOU** trying to win is toxic to your opponent.
---
Maybe after changing and fixing tier 3 challenges there would be less campers?
---
The beauty of ruin is level 1 is just as good, so it beats out any other meh perk, like level 1 whispers or stbfl.   
---
But oh boi do survs hate it. Its most effective when the killers getting steam rolled and gen rushed so the survs have a false confidence and overextend.
---
They are when you are swf
---
Well I was winning as ghostface when I got host disconnect at a suspicious time..
---
DBD is competitive enough for people to get upset about the killer having a big passive buff without actually having to do anything, and rightfully so
---

---
Not that it’ll matter if they stare at a wall, but based on the wording I bet you can give this even if you blind the killer too early.
---
Try re opening the game or search again
---
If the killer plays shitty I blame my teamates. Nothing worse then a facecamper when your teamates arent working on gens
---
Yeah, cause those are totally the same thing
---
Hopefully
---
Haha same^^
---
More killers than survivors, so survivors get quick queues but killers take forever, like moving up a queue
---
Fun fact: Overly altruistic survivors are the #1 cause of clutch 4k's.
---
It’s crazy that these people are so salty they’re making these ridiculous assumptions
---
I hope you get some good games man not against toxic killers
---
Did he get out? I think yes, but holy shit now I hate that dude more than before
---
Susie sliding off the gen after the time runs out and giving a quiet "Careful, Frank's really mad." to a nervous Dwight waiting to work on the gen.
---
I get 1 every game usually gatekeeper
---
I'm a rank 5 survivor and in every game where survivors don't cleanse, they'll usually get slugged and die because plague can hook 1 then proxy camp and if she can get 2 people on hooks at the same time or 1 person on a hook and the rest slugged she wins. 
---
However, a valid strategy is to cleanse as soon as you can.  This puts the plague into a tough spot.  If she takes advantage of her corrupt plague she can't infect objects and it's alot easier to stay healthy, but if she doesn't use the corrupt plague survivors can cleanse all the fountains and reset it. (and then they lose the ability to snowball)
---
So, when I play I cleanse all the time, and that's been a very successful strategy for me.
---
Killer main, can confirm.
---
I legit had to tell the 2 last survivors to do gens. I was crushing the game waaaaay to hard
---
Oh god I can hear Ellis from L4D2
---
They could at least fix the incandescent thingy sooner than the tome changes but oh well =/
---
 4 kills with camping, or pretending not to camp but always coming back to the hook right after injuring another survivor 15 metres away = bad killer.  And do not come at me with borrowed time etc fullshit. People are not eager to risk getting one shotted by bubba or bill only
---
To be facecamped right after, especially if its not swf. But, a big but, it also means bad survivors. A camper should get 2k at most in a game and the rest should rush the gens and get the heck out of there.
---
4 kills by putting pressure on everyone on the map, outclassing the survivors with skill and smarts= good killer. Hell, use all your OP add ons and offerings, kill everyone but just let people play the game.
---
Even the amount of points you earn in a game
---
Suggests this. A killer who kills after hooking once will get lot less points for hooking less, hitting and downing less, chasing less etc. 
---
even if you get your kills, the game tells you there is a lot more to do in a game. Like playing it for instance.

Its just that they are dropping it when they disarm the trap. Its stupid and useless, thats ehy its funny

That's why they call it 'vendredi'.
---
Yeah but maybe he was the thing all along...
---
&gt;It's not about how many kills you get, it's about people having fun.
---
I know that this is the consensus here on reddit, but to be honest, I don't care wether my opponents have fun or not.  
---
I play Killer/Survivor to enjoy the game, not to please my 'enemy'.  
---
If I queue League of Legends and we crush the enemy team, I won't start doing mistakes to leave them a chance.  
---
If I play a ranked game of Starcraft 2 and I am winning in the early game I won't just suddenly stop doing progress so the opponent can recover.
---
Lots of people here on this subreddit tell killers to play in a certain way so the survivors enjoy the game.
---
(Don't tunnel or camp, it isn't fun for the survivors).
---
For me this would be the equivalent of telling the surviviors:
---
Don't cleanse a hex totem (Ruin) in the first minute of the game. It isn't fun for the killer.
---
Or: Don't "genrush", take the game easy so it doesn't stress the killer out.
---
Don't get me wrong.  I am the guy that allways gifts the hatch if there is no t-bag/bm, but it's weird to see all these posts where people tell killers to please survivors.
---
Should have used the Dead Hard to win the race on the 2nd door.
---
Reddit can be a very 'for' or 'against' place and unless you word it very carefully people will just add it on to other opinions automatically, depending on the general way its written. Don't stress dude.
---
I thought most of them were fine. One that bugged me the most was getting one iridescent when I got 4 in a trial.
---
Why would you even say you're a "Kate main"?
---
Also, you said you just came back after 2 months. There was an influx of players from Oct sales, and current sales, so you're probably playing against killers who don't entirely know what they're doing and are doing that.
---
If you don't like getting tunneled my suggestion is to not get caught and learn to loop really well, run DS, run BT, and hope your teammates slam gen while the killer camps, as you say.
---
Honestly, I find a lot of people accuse people of camping and tunneling and leave out a lot of the specifics, which actually justify the killer doing said things.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Some survivors DC to deny you perks like Pop or BBQ, you don't always meet survivors like in this vid.
---
He's a multi millionaire ?? Oh wait right the top of society is full of buffons, how could I forget ?
---
Sounds like an AD for NOED.
---
Cute. Absurd, but cute.
---
Doesn't really prove your point though, because all you're doing is proving my point. You talking about nerfing survivors from the killer point of "unfun" sounds just as absurd as you talking about nerfing killers from the survivor point of "unfun."
---
The game tought you were hacking for putting this much traps in such short span. Never tried to have all surv get a trap maybe its not allowed in the code ?
---
Because people like his commentary/comedy and gameplay style. Some people prefer more editing in the videos they watch, and just because you don’t like swearing doesn’t make him any less fun for others to watch. And you don’t have to watch youtubers for their level of skill, plenty of incredibly famous YouTubers (who go on TV even) who have limited skill yet have millions of fans, because they’re funny, and you may not find them funny even but doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things.
---
Can confirm.
---
Rift fragments.
---
This is a fact I don’t see talked about much, but there’s been a lot of stuff in the files about a Teacher killer that was never actually created.
---
You can create Trapper’s concept art design using the Chuckles mask, Butcher’s Bane outfit, and the Knapped Copper Cleaver weapon.
---
Trapper was originally called Chuckles.
---
The killer shack roof has proper collision. It’s thought that at some point in development, it was intended for the roof to be accessible via climbing. 
---
The files refer to killers as Slashers and survivors as Campers.
---
Having the chance to try the premium stuff for free wouldn't hurt either. No reason both of us can't be right.
---
I'm always just doing my best because I need the blood points. Also I don't have the need to feel superior over the survivors so I just do what killers do. Stabby Stabby.
---
says the baby Ash lol
---
Twoo tawent

You can still have internet issues in really good areas with great internet. Where do you live that has consistently good internet? And I would expect every content creator to take a break if they need it, whether it be for mental health or just wanting a break. And they sure as hell don’t have to give an explanation for it.
---
Broken key has a usage
---
“Stream snipers” - after any decent play or figuring out he has BBQ/nurses
---
Correction. 
---
4kills = bad killer.  
---
0 kills = GG ez, baby killer
---
I'd rather 1v4 than 1v2v2 or 1v1v1v1v1 or whatever bullshit hand I'm dealt in solo, hahaha.
---
WAY more fucking bloodpoints for way less stress while having way more control and no one can just completely fuck you over. It's amazing.
---
Doesn't "toxic" imply malicious intent? If so, then camping can only be considered "toxic" if someone is doing solely for the purpose of being a jerk to that person. 
---
I feel like it's mostly done by noob killers who feel like they need to secure their kill, even though in reity it hurts them.
---
Ghost face player here, I just find it fun to be friendly.
---
lol I haven't played survivor in a long while, mostly a killer main. Usually only play survivor when friends wanna jump in so my rank keeps resetting

Yeah you get a bunch of blood points and such too so it's way easier to get these perks.
---
Depending on how far they take it though, I'd love to see them do free killers and have DLC lore, and if that's the case they might need to give some perks and such.

We'll see. I don't very much trust BVHR to make anything fun though.

They did nerf it to the brim but forgot to actually test it... as usual.
---
Where in this case boil over doesn't affect wiggling than probably 5% or none. It's just I still don't see the difference at all.
---
I'm gonna start running Ruin, BBQ, NOED and Enduring all the time just for these memes.
---
You claim you want to do the quest for that a rank 1 perk is good enough... It's not about fairness it's about the principle behind what you ask! You want to complete the quest and I can understand that, but asking for a Rank III skill when a Rank I will do is just greed!
---
Rather an ad for bloodwarden.
---
Even then it’s even more incentive to let them live till late game so you can mori dat ass
---
Always takes a t-bag to change everything.
---
I did that crazy thing against a prayer bead spirit with ruin... Thanks to my speed toolbox and distortion!
---
This... This is why I love trapper. My favourite thing in life is seeing a survivor tbagging, immediately running into a trap, and dcing
---
Very sexy, like it
---
I just got a real good feeling that they both got the same vocabulary of swear words.
---
However you define it, it's still trying to dictate how your opponent plays the game.
---
And if you're okaying dictate how your opponent plays the game because you're not having fun, then you have to agree that your opponent can dictate how you play the game because they're not having fun.

I had a game where I was running lvl 1 ruin and the survivors completely stopped doing gens and instead looked for ruin until they died because they couldn't find it. The post game chat was just: "WHERE THE FUCK WAS THAT GOD DAMN RUIN"
---
More than likely he's been taught that camping works by shitty survivors that rush to unhook instead of realizing the camp and doing gens. Bad survivors try to force the unhook, feed the camp, and reward the killer.
---
When survivors take the bait, the killer gets rewarded. If I were to constantly get 3 or 4 kills by camping, why wouldn't I camp?
---
If it's stupid, but it works, it's not stupid.
---
God I really hope so
---
Okay but this is funny because from all the ghostface players I‘ve encountered only 2 or 3 were actually good, the rest were just camping and tunneling the hell out of you, actually made me really hate playing against ghostface because I only expect trash players now
---
How will the DC penalty work in practice? How much can (in this case unironically) unstable internet screw you over?
---
Sloppy now worthless. Go with Thana for sure, maybe nemisis/pwyf (for pwyf stacks, not cheesing the oblivious mechanic)
---
Bra, the portals, usually it’s 2 near every gen and a few in rhe nearest loops
---
the best thing you can do is to not get yourself in a three gen in the first place. but if the killer is forcing you into it, work on all three gens at once and make sure to communicate, and try sabotaging books near the gens to make the killer decide between bringing the survivor to a hook that’s further away or to slug them and risk them getting picked up.
---
That's pretty no-life ngl
---
If the killer is right there watching it and targeting everyone else but the Claudette then yea, but simply farming people and throwing the game to do it is not bannable. Maybe the killer didn’t know Claudette was farming everyone and after else was dead he got some extra points and let her get hatch, I do that all the time (especially if I haven’t gotten my daily yet).
---
Ace with bright cosmetics : Toxic piece of shit
---
Give this man a gold
---
Rusty spoons?
---
Buying tiers is a plain waste of money
---
They can be destroyed and if the killer is protecting the portals that gives you time to do gens
---
The entity should be on the generators place.
---
I can’t imagine them ignoring DLC, since the base game only has like 3 killers. 
---
The system OP talks about makes it so people can use the killer/survivor/perk they don’t have.
---
Unless you're face camping or trying to get to a basement hook won't make much difference half the time
---
Ok
---
i don’t need quick and quiet, i’ve been told that i’m already fast enough 😤
---
Bam Bam is best demon boi
---
Ah, i see. Thanks for pointing  that out.
---
Same as watching Monty Python, SNL Skits, any old comedy sketch group really. The humour isn’t the same anymore. 
---
Everything funny nowadays is basically depressing so yeah.
---
Shh. *There is no spoon.*
---
Yup want to add as well if OP is fresh back after 2 months they are likely playing at yellow rank which means a lot of new killers and unskilled killers.
---
Most true yellow rank killers see their goal as "kill at any cost" this means trying to secure every kill first hook and if they get off the hook going for the "injured" survivor.
---
As your rank increases you see it less because killers learn the finer points like juggling pressure and time management and also earning way more BP. Also as rank increases they will see survivors who will take the 1 hook while the other 3 finish the gens and escape.
---
The best punishment and teaching we can do to campers is make sure they never get more then a 1-2k for their strategy.
---
wholesome
---
&gt;Firstly, the game really isn't that competitive
---
Sure, in comparisson to League, Starcraft and eSport games, yes. DbD is more of a party game.  
---
But people still try to win (if they don't go for a troll or meme build).   
---
They still give their best. They still get mad when they lose.
---
&gt; As it is, you can get a ton more BP or Pips for not ending the game as fast as humanly possible 
---
I also agree. Not camping / Not 'rushing' gens will result in more BP.
---
&gt; Secondly, I'd say that "Don't camp and tunnel" isn't equivalent to "Leave Ruin standing for a minute", but rather "Don't hide in the corner of the map not doing anything 
---
I'd disagree. Camping and Tunneling is a strategy perceived as toxic, but even though people don't like doing it (aswell as being at the other end of it) these strategies if executed correctly will bring you to your objective.  
---
Streamers with a lot of experience confirm this.  
---
Tru3Talent for example said that he is able to push any killer perkless to rank 1, but he would have to tunnel and camp a lot.  
---
Even Otzdarva said something similiar.  
---
So camping/tunneling if used right might end up being the right call as killer to make if you want to win the game, even though it is pretty lame.  
---
This Subreddit disagrees on this, though. People here say that camping/tunneling IS ALLWAYS the wrong decision and will harm you. I disagree.  
---
Hiding in the corner of the map not doing anything doesn't bring you closer to your objective. I mean, you could still "survive", yes, but you'll end up depipping and most likely since you weren't doing gens you'll end up dead.  
---
Telling the killer to never camp or tunnel would just take a usefull tool from his kit for the only reason of it being "not fun".  
---
It's like telling survivor to not loop or cleanse.
---
&gt; Quite frankly, I'd drop this game after a week of playing against nothing but completely immersed survivors since that wouldn't be fun in the slightest. 
---
It would be boring because you'd just pick doc or wraith and win every game, yes.
---
Sadly, "Stealth" is boring in this game.
---
&gt; Lastly, I don't think it's just people telling Killers they have to please survivors 
---
It is in my opinion. Sure I see the: "Gen rush is toxic" here and there, but mostly it is rules telling the killer how to play, since he's the "power role" who is in controll of the game.  
---
I mean there are even famous memes about it like the "Survivors Rulebook for Killers" since stuff like this happens so often.
---
I tell people to not BM, T-Bag or be toxic in the chat. This is fine.  
---
Telling people which perks to use, how to play etc because some perceive it as toxic - isn't.
---
Go ahead. Run Adrenaline, DS / NOED, Ruin if you want to. It doesn't make you a shitty person.
---
&gt;  I don't think anyone else is going to complain that you tunnel them out of the game due to them putting a giant target on their back and they kind of lost the right to complain with how brazen it is. 
---
But that is what is happening.  
---
I had countless games where I played defensivly arround the hook after noticing that I was against heavily altruistic SWF which went for saves NO MATTER WHAT.  
---
They'd still complain and insult me, point at takes such as:  
---
"You are not allowed as killer to X if survivor does Y or else you are toxic and we'll report you."
---
Couldn't have cropped it any worse 😩😩😩
---
Yup!
---
Run M&amp;A/thanatophobia/ruin/nurses on legion, and remember their power is about juggling, not tunneling. The massive burst of information from M&amp;A can tell you exactly who to go for, and you can pull the nurses/m&amp;a trick when everyone is injured. You just gotta remember to juggle multiple survivors and keep them injured, the pressure can force them to make mistakes.
---
Spirit can be pretty much the opposite if you want, but juggling is still the best tactic. Run Stridor/nurses/sloppy and probably ruin for slowdown. Can catch people off guard and phase to them with nurses, use Stridor to hear where they are and attack. Also, just don't chase as spirit, there's no point. Without the power you are a 110 killer, so playing the survivors game is a sure way to lose.
---
Most of Mel Brooks' humor was pretty juvenile. I mean, he had a bunch of cowboys sitting around a campfire farting up a storm, a very campy nazi singing about "Spring time for hitler", and Victor Frankenstein attaching The Monster's penis to himself. That's not the height of sophistication.
---
Which isn't to say it's bad. My friends and I still say "Werewolf!" "There Wolf!", "Engage Ludicrous Speed!" and so on. The humor is just something you either grow out of or have to be on something to appreciate.

---
Given i have no real say in the matter, the devs could easily make it rank 1 instead of 3 and there would be no harm done.
---
My thought processes were for brand new players who had no idea what to expect. If they find a perk in the challenges and like how it plays at max rank, that will make them more likely to grind for it on the webs and earn it normally.
---
Actually they are simmilar. Both dont have a good counter. And both are unfun for the other side. The only difference is people will tell you to kill yourself if you camp.
---
Yeah it encourages longer games where it's a back-and-forth.  Like a Survivor is usually able to pip up if they contribute to generators and make a few unhooks or can run/evade the Killer well enough.  
---
A Killer though loses a good chunk of their scoring for the Gatekeeper emblem if they can't keep the Survivors from rushing gens.  That's unfortunately why Hex: Ruin and now Dying Light/Thanataphobia builds are becoming more common, if not necessary for Killers who can't apply early pressure.  
---
Snowball games though are bad for either side and at best you might get one pip off of it if that.
---
New killer: Salad Fingers
---
You get a guy from unhooking you're far from another hook
---
The quality aint that bad is it? I play xbox in case u actually wanted to know
---
Is this change out on PC yet? My challenges are still the same
---
I think Twitch Rivals went past without much notice because DbD isn't inherently a competitive game. A lot of the groups were quite tryhard from what I heard and while that's totally fine - people will play how they play - it's not all that entertaining to watch. The only group I watched was Puppers/Edgar/Bahroo/Angrypug/OhTofu because they fucked around a little and kept it fun to watch. From those streamers perspectives they were laughing and having a great time and for me that's what keeps me watching a stream. 
---
If I wanted to watch someone lose to an efficient 4 man swf or get a perfect 4k on a high tier killer, I'd just play the game myself.
---
Im sorry but what was the fun part of the clip? It was just a guy mumbling and then someone exposed by ghostface got downed. And then a earrape outro.
---
Don't know if it's ban worthy but sometimes I help survivors get quick gens and guide them to others  with out hurting them
---
Lol this is great
---
Deliverance just undoes a lot of your work without really getting you anything if you left to try and pressure generators, even without Iron Will in play good luck combing enough of the map to find that injured survivor without wasting too much time.
---
Perhaps mostly importantly, Deliverance punishes you for allowing anyone to get unhooked, or actively punishes you for hooking them in the first place.
---
DS+BT is worse, I had a four-man SWF unhook a guy behind me while I carried another to the basement, and that one unhooked the one in the basement, hit me with BT, the next comes down with DS, it's pretty crazy when you're dealing with all of that shit.
---
And then the moment you leave after getting the one you managed to hook, if you're lucky, they Deliverance off behind you, with their exhaustion perk back (honestly I feel like exhaustion shouldn't automatically recover like that) and their own DS running.
---
Yeah I really would wanna keep this is not happening and dark sense...
---
Most of the perk in the challenge are compete garbage
---
I met a GF that let me escape so I booped his snoot. He seemed pleased.
---
if you're face camping, you drop them on the floor and ignore after that
---
That's slugging
---
What do you mean?
---
&gt;no
---
5 minutes is minor try waiting 10-15
---
Good tips to beginners
---
You have a person hooked, so you protect them. if you happen to grab someone else, you slug them and wait for the one on the hook to die.
---
it has nothing to do with hooks being far
---
Your hook is gone if that guy dies how you hooking the other guy magic?
---
Thank you for the information!
---
Yes on both questions.
---
Oh really? How does it work specifically?
---
And of course he doesn’t reply. Well said.
---
Good idea but it won't help with certain challenges. For example, the 2 EGC sacrifices with NOED also realistically requires Blood Warden. 
---
Either way, it is a good idea, especially considering how BW's currently work and how you can end up grinding for dozens of BW's if you have shit rng, like I did to get Enduring 3 on Wraith back in the day. Over 120 Bloodwebs later...
---
what book is this?
---
Consider this:
---
The survivor only needs 20 seconds.
---
The survivor has 35/36 seconds (35 for Sprint Burst, 36 for Adrenaline).
---
The survivor has 15 seconds worth of inefficient running allotted to them and they will still fall past the escape trigger when downed, this is 75% of the time needed to open the gate, I would be surprised if less than 75% of people running Adrenaline failed to escape, particularly since it's not a matter of RNG, the numbers always work and any failure is due to a lack of personal skill.
---
Now someone who has Adrenaline on a team who refuses to open the gates may have an issue, but even going back for a save in EGC once your exhaustion has recovered (to use Lithe or Sprint Burst or Balanced Landing) isn't going to kill you as long as you run for the gate upon taking a hit, overstaying may kill, but it doesn't change the issue that you can't really be killed short of voluntarily refusing to open the gates or voluntarily taking two hits.
---
Gross!! Don't they know about cooties!?
---
Woosh
---
I know the feeling lol. I thought once I'm in red ranks it'll be  easier but nope. Green ranks seems to be the best rank to stay in.
---
I dont understand the depravity of some people. This is just godawful.
---
Honestly you place here worst example of perk lets because its meta perk and 4k in single match i challange could be more like "hook 10 survivors with BBQ' and what you can't not use it because it challange would force you to use it like quest with dark sense force you to use it not just have it beside a lot of challange perks would be garbage . you want good example of challanges with "loaning perek" here you go "Heal a total of 10 health state using autodidact" you want something with meta perk? "escape using adrenaline" "Be in chase of total 180 seconds using lithe" so   
---
TL;DR You used worst example of quest that you could think of but there is a ton of better example.
---
Probably because you complain about toxic survs and not about toxic killers
---
2 exhaustion perks and adrenaline, and people keep telling me adrenaline and dead hard aren’t stupidly valuable to have
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, it's true, 5-15 minute queues are not an abnormality as SWF *or* killer. At least as SWF you can just talk about other stuff in the meantime, while as killer it's probably just waiting.
---
It isn't about is it good or not 
---
It is about making them feel despair.
---
I don't apologize for anything when playing killer, I'm just playing the game as intended my dude.
---
What is the challenge now?
---
awh bonding
---
Me, a baby killer at rank 19 against 4 red ranks woth flashlights and DS
---
Yea, seeing the EXPOSED icon is pretty despair'ish.  
---
Seeing bloodwarden pop is like "Meh" aslong as you aren't trying to t-bag the killer at the exit gate.
---
It will be only one EGC unhook but they won’t change it until next week.
---
You're cute
---
Bro just bring slippery meat, up the ante and salty lips /s
---
Say that to bhvr
---
Not much else you can do when the gates are powered.
---
I like to just slug them and let them help each other out on purpose so i can torment them longer
---
i was thinking more about the statement "  Nope. I wish No mither reduced it to %100 and canceled out stridor. Then there would be an actual reason to run it. " which just isnt true no mither will never be good for stealth
---
im not really talking about your idea
---
sure you could make some whacky "injured builds for better repairs or bp farming)
---
It’s a fault of the structure of the game itself. In pretty much any outnumbered situation your best bet is to reduce enemy numbers. To do this quickly you would get 3 hooks as fast as possible on one survivor, a “focus fire”  strategy if you will. Your odds of 3 v 1 are much better than 4 v 1. As you continue this strategy you will find it will next be 2 v 1, even better odds. Then 1 v 1 against an opponent who can only flee. 
---
But that’s toxic, it’s not fun for the other players, etc. As if it is you the killers fault that the game’s design is a bit heavily flawed from the very beginning. 
---
The beat way to win is reduce the number of those acting against you as fast as possible, but the same people who devised this situation will also tell you, “don’t do that, spread out your attacks, prolong the game.” 
---
Which is absurd because from a killer side the more time that passes in each game is another step closer to defeat.
---
You don't need to grind that much if you're a new player though. You can tier 3 all perks that are available to you on both sides by level 50 if you don't get teachables.

It's probably more difficult for players in the middle of the road like myself who have all teachables unlocked, but no all-perk characters. Many of these perks aren't what I would prioritize in the bloodweb so by the time these challenges pop-up I've to browse through all my characters to see which ones actually have them.
---
I hate it when the killer loops me.
---
I play a really friendly game as killer; going so far as walking past the survivor that just got unhooked if they bump into me, but if someone runs me through one of the like 3 remaining infinite windows, I am camping the fuck out of them.
---
I don't care about my bloodpoints, I will camp them and enjoy it.
---
It'd be nice if you could change it in the settings.
---
I'd rather swirl my stick around like if I'm being carried than spam one button for 30 seconds...
---
Not to mention clearing your inventory of those WORTHLESS Odd Bulbs (or hell almost all of the flashlight add-ons) and Faint Reagents that I don't even like looking at. I'll take the option even to discard them without reward.
---
in Level 4 you need to unhook 3 people (After endgame collapse begun)
---
Don't get caught... Play Blendette use Empathy and Spine Chill and you will never be caught of guard. That way you can learn to be sneaky and replace the perks later on.
---
Mole Rat as the killer? 
---
Na mate, Mr Barkin as the killer 😂
---
bois, be ready for 10 yo fartnite kids to camp the hell out of us
---
Best thing you can do is loop him around pallets like any other killer. You've mostly got the advantage over him as he won't be able to hit you with his chainsaw if he gets stunned or you're behind a vault.
---
keep distance, he only wins if he can get to you before you reach a window or a pallet.
---
Don't run out in the open, get to a tile and loop it tightly as a last resort
---
What is "the" problem?
---
I saw your first comment where you said this is a shitty community, since I am part of this community, I did not like that comment
---
Then you claimed that people who downvoted your first comment DC, I do not DC, so I did not like your second comment
---
I use thanatophobia, corrupt intervention, discordance and pop goes the weasel. I swichted ruin for discordance for some map awareness, since I have thanatophobia for the slowdown but I gotta say, even then, its hard. Gens are still done too fast, so if you are struggling with gens with this build, feel free to use ruin instead of discordance. If you feel like you can apply pressure, and have a more aggressive play style you can use Infectious Fright instead of ruin/discordance.
---
I know this already but thanks anyway. It's not like we are newbees (we aren't pro's either ^^).
---
I know he just staggers for a moment and keeps going afterwards. But most times He don't even tramble a bit, he just keeps going and since killers can hit over pallets and 6 feets trough windows looping isn't that easy anymore.
---
I mean yes there are way harder killers but Leatherfaces and Billis zero-skill one hit downs are just a pain for the game
---
Also with monitor &amp; abuse
---
Splinter's still exist?

On the plague I always use:
---
\- BBQ  
---
\- Ruin  
---
\- Thanataphobia  
---
\- Dying Light
---
It's a bitch to play against *(And goes with every add-on set and offering)*. BBQ and Ruin are obvious, Thanataphobia pressures the Survivors to use the fountains *(especially when using "Black Incense" on top of this)* Dying light is a a great addition to Thanataphobia because it delays the repairs even longer. You can with ease get 20%+ delay by mid game. and if by that time your Ruin is still up you're pretty well on your way to 4k the match *(It'll all depend on that last Hatch Camper)*.

---
I too enjoy being the fun friendly killer
---
Sure sure but pallets will run out.
---
Thanks anyway
---
True Strength is what I need in my life yes please.
---
So there is nothing more than I already trying, thanks
---
I actually haven't lol it's like 70% in game, 30% reddit
---
I don't know what I'm meant to be looking at here
---
Site called Render Forrest, actually took me 15 min to make it
---
Ooooohhh, who has been a naughty little cheater?
---
It would be cool BUT if its a stealth killer with its charm equipped then u can just check the hooks
---
[Fungoose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Z_y5UA3ho) recommends Ruin, BBQ, Dying Light, and Thanataphobia for new plagues. For more experiences players, he recommends Corrupt, Pop, Discordance, and Infectious.

Hook 2 in basement took me 2 games. Not big deal. There were literally 2 or 3 that were a bit too time consuming like 8 Keys or 10 escapes
---
For the killer one, are you talking about the queue or..?
---
Fuck off man with this shit even for shitpost, you dont have to post literal shit here you know?
---
PS4 ingame bug
---
Was doing a gen and skill checks were fine one minute, and then the next time one came up it played the noise but the skill check was invisible so I couldn’t hit it. The killer wasn’t running ruin or lullaby or anything but they were a bit laggy. This continued throughout the match so skill checks were impossible to hit - including DS
---
Thats true. I'm doing this as much as possible but sometimes there is a too bad timing of mine and He gets me while looping.
---
Well thanks for all the advices.
---
Restart the game! if it's not enough restart steam! it should work!
---
Blame dedicated servers
---
Imagine if when Insidious pops on Wraith, because it makes him so quiet it ends up releasing an insanely loud guttural sound instead?
---
Yeah I always want to but my gf always don't want to xD
---
Same as you and im rank 66 how is that possible damn
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1200535335991697408
---
There are always 3 gens close together in every map... It's a tactic like any other you'll just need good teamwork and a guy willing to loop the killer around while 3 others do a gen.
---
Fuck Man play less than 100 matches in 2 weeks is grindy as fck
---
Hahaha is this at rank 12ish? Pretty sure I was the ghost face. Remember playing cold wind earlier in the afternoon/morning today and chilling with the last 2 survivors because 2 let go on hook. Cosmetics fit.
---
Yes thats why They reduce numbers for casuals BUT not exp gain from matches or exp to level up. This changes nothing it will take the same time to get 70
---
Corrupt Intervention, Thanataphobia, Dying Light and Pop Goes the Weasel is what I use.
---
Lol for the past two days I’ve been doing nothing but farming and letting survivors do their challenges
---
that's genius, could even give of auras or noise notifs.
---
WHY DOES HE HAVE MAD GRIT is probably what they thought lmao
---
... It doesn't mean I like it though!
---
they can spectate the killer and they have survivor perks
---
amazing
---
and the one challenge pretty much begs for it lol
---
I don’t get why would anyone want to watch someone like that. I hope it’s a one time thing and he doesn’t come back.
---
Aah look I found a salty survivor!
---
She got a sweater last year
---
Spoiler in the headline bud.
---
True. But then the average person wouldn't know what it was.
---
if i wasn’t poor I’d give you platinum for this comment.
---
That’s why you should always use Hex Ruin to protect yourself from such toxic life forms!
---
Yeeeeeeeeesssss!!
---
Thanks a ton my dude!!
---
I just need to learn how to place custom icons in the game xD
---
All the campers I get claim they “weren’t trying” and “have gotten to rank 1 before, noob”
---
Acting kind of like lookouts for the real one? I like the idea
---
Sure bud, thingy in my nickname means nothing
---
No,
---
If they are new I'm assuming they wouldn't buy the archives anyway. Also this would cause huge backend 
---
disruption.
---
Maybe its because of a certain Noob guy? Not sure tho
---
how did he not see that trap
---
It's the most satisfying as Plague. They just have to stand there and take a full stream of puke to the face.
---
They waited half the endgame timer for the killer to get there and rub it in .... WhO hUrT YoU ... dense mfcker my god ....
---
Let me que up for a survivor challenge and a killer challenge. 
---
With how slow the menu is switching between survivor and killer is even worse than before. (Also return the 'switch to killer/survivor' button to the hud!)
---
And Mori. And Haunted Grounds. And Insidous. And BBQ. While playing Bubba
---
What plotholes are in the story?
---
yea i just got 4 and got 1
---
wtf
---
I think he got a bit too excited about pulling off those moves to notice it ahaha.
---
They care about bloodpoints not surviving. Sad isn't it?
---
Oh lmao sorry, just your Switch controller looks like the Google stadia controller 😂
---
Adernaline is a must have perk as a survivor, majority run it in their builds. I rarely see a survivor without it.
---
I think having them sit on high points of the map or on the walls around windows and generators, just watching survivors would be better. Turning their heads and tracking the survivors as they run by or try to hide, slightly helping out the killer if a survivor is hiding near one of the kids.
---
that's statistically impossible based on how the emblems work.
---
I feel that people have been DCing extra hard lately since they’re soon going to be penalized for it. I was playing as Ghostie the other day, and one person DCd after first hit, someone else DCd after their first hit, and a third person DCd when I grabbed them off a gen for their third hook. I gave the last dude the hatch.
---
It means your standing next to a trap and he's figuring out what kind of gymnastics he'll have to perform to get you to step in it.
---
I pulled someone off the unhook animation, so it instantly put them on my shoulder and I hooked them and got a 4K since they were the last two
---
Salt salt salt
---
Bruh how is it camping when you’re trying to unhook as I’m looking at you immediately after I hooked the person in the first place, AND you’re the only person alive that isn’t on a hook, who the fuck else am I supposed to go after
---
okay so, i reached out to him and talked to him about this. his excuse was "i found this image and thought that is was really cool so i posted it here". i asked him about trying to take credit for this image and he said "i didn't act like i made the picture. im sorting it out with garadon."
---
Emergency heals others and yourself 50% faster (iirc) so it's whatever.
---
Play freddy for the bright white dream world effect lmao
---
Me out of hatchets.
---
Me get... more hatchets!
---
it is bait
---
He's more into fingering though
---
could be an update trying to happen
---
This game will never be "fun for both sides". Why? Because losing isn't fun. If this community wasn't full of so many people with no PvP exeperience then that moot point wouldn't be argued so hard. Anyways. Slowdown builds help weaker killers not get their gens completed in five minutes. Obviously not counting forever Freddy. And let's be real here. Thana only increases gen times by about twelve seconda at max stacks. Good luck keeping everyone injured with any killer that isn't Legion or Plague though.
---
Oh and if you " don't have much time to play" then don't play at all until you do. I'd rather get a different survivor on my team than one who disconnects because they think its justified. Unless the killer is actually holding you hostage (re: bodyblocking you in a corner) or hacking, then suck it up and take the loss.
---
December 3rd
---
I'm opposite of you. I seem to mostly go against killers that expressly tunnel, and killers who facecamp the whole game. I would love to go against some killer that doesn't play like that. What platform are you on?
---
Looking through his posts I think this dude just steals stuff from Insta and posts it here
---
I'm not agreeing with you. I'm fine with being outplayed, or losing. The problem is people being dicks about it. 
---
And in DbD losing is just not playing and incredibly frustrating as killer. Some maps, mixed with bad rng, and you have no chance of winning withouth tunneling someone
---
I'm struggling with no one escapes endgame
---
U can legally do that cuz its november no longer
---
She asserts dominance to an empty trial since the survivors have escaped by the time her slow ass stands back up.
---
it is okay you will stop getting frustrated when you find your peace
---
He comes out on the 3rd, which is 2 weeks after PTB launch.
---
Yes viewer of this meme that is what I made this thing on congratulations, you get a cookie
---
He comes out on Tuesday.
---
Lets be honest, the newer players are hiding on the other side of the map in a locker :P
---
Ah so that is 2 nice things that comes out on the 3rd
---
Happens to me too
---
Did I got those downvotes for mixing up the rank numbers? Even in backwards universe, they are confusing. Still, Nurse is too good on new players despite all her problems, statistics don't lie, something needs to be done about it. Maybe it's the new players trying to deny it?
---
True 😂
---
I love your bravery. I'm surprised all of the oinking weirdos haven't downvoted you into oblivion yet
---
What's your problem
---
EDIT: You call my meme shit, you've posted a picture of 2 cars with ghostface in one of them
---
I'm on pc, and i'm sorry to ear that :/ Tho i think i am more easy to trigger than most people ? I have no problem with losing, not a single one, even if it was unfair, even if it was a tough map, bad rng, whatever, what triggers me is people being absolute dush about it.
---
Good luck sneaking away and "winning" with two disconnects and someone on the ground. Delusion is a hell of a drug.
---
He stated he doesnt farm because it would be boring for stream. Fair enough reason, Experiencing farming is boring, but watching it? A good majority of the content would be farming because someone always dcs
---
yeah kinda annoying..the skin is clean as hell tho
---
thanks :D
---
Fantastic art. And yes I love Bonk. I'm hoping he doesn't get nerfed too hard but I'm maining him regardless. I've wanted an angry demon as a killer since we first got Myers.
---
I t hi I you meant he said “_____”
---
If he's looping the killer most of the match that doesn't mean he's definitely wasting pallets first of all. Second of all, while he's being chased everybody else should be doing generators, which means there should be at least 2 gens going, if not 3
---
Yep. And this is the very reason why I'll always despise playing against Huntress by far the most besides of maybe Spirits.
---
As long as the Servers ain't optimized to the level at which they're capable of making the interaction with Huntress' hatchets at least kinda close to realistic, getting downed by her feels always so damn undeserved und unfair that it makes the entire experience just infuriating and nothing else.
---
Killers that use this excuse are the same killers that also stand less then 10 meters from the hook and say their not camping they’re just scouting the perimeter. Like sis please you’re camping smh
---
Same for me and my killer rank is 9. I understand having issues at yellow ranks, but green almost purple?
---
Sorry, I didn't realize this community was full of children that think the only way to have fun was winning in an asymmetrical game that was never meant to be competitive. Obviously a lot of people that think they need 4 slowdowns because they're shit at chase and need 2 minutes to down one person.
---
I find her perk is actually pretty bad for the person using it. If someones running it then they have to be extremely close to the killer to get the benefit. As a killer, it's very easy to just drop the survivor that you're carrying and smack the dude, now they have to decide on going away to heal or risk getting hit again, plus if you've got a survivor in your arms and someones trying to speed up their wiggle, that's two survivors not working on gens.
---
Guys, Thicc Feng wants to spoon
---
Slippery Meat after it has happened.
---
Try to avoid the three gen set up in the first place. I think Feng has the perk that automatically shows you the closest three gens to each other at the start of the match, you could make a B line for those gens and work those
---
His snares can deny loops pretty easily, gen teleporting makes him even better. Defenitely worth buying
---
Alternatively you just camp out for the hatch, or bring a map and hope another survivor brings a key
---
Still hoping Xbox and PS4 will be able to cross one day, there’s only so much fortnite the boys can play with the one Xbox homie before getting burnt out
---
He's really good. Even with base kit he can do well as his power and snares are very good.
---
I don't want another Ochiido and by the looks of it, Ninjas pretty toxic. I'm all for more people joining but I'd rather have less people than a giant wave of toxic sludge hitting the game.
---
I feel this high key, I got freddy, spirit, demogorgon, and Steve for about $10
---
Omfg awww
---
I find this story too wholesome not to share
---
So my two friends are fairly new to the game at rank 20 and 18 and wanted to play together last night despite me being in red ranks. 
---
The first match we got destroyed by a Leatherface who brought an ebony mori (probably because 3 Claudettes joined the lobby at the same time, I don't blame him lol) so that's why I decided to inform the next killer what he's up against and to perhaps take it easy which turned into a 30+ minutes match of us showing them how to loop and survive instead. 
---
Basically a survivor bootcamp.
---
He helped me show them how to loop, hugging walls around killer shack, how to window tech, how to perform a pallet safe, how to use t and i walls properly, loop around and on the tractors on coldwind farm, and what double backing is and the usual mindgames. 
---
At the end he let us farm and escape with lots of BPs for them to continue their grind. It was one of the most fun experiences I have ever had in DbD!
---
Are you sure you dont mean hillbilly? Becuase leatherfaces chainsaw is super slow.
---
Meta perks are overrated. I've been destroying SWF groups with Sloppy, Hex The Third, Thanatophobia, and Discordance as the Pig
---
Yes, gimme a spoon.
---
Following this logic, tbagging is a strategy. It baits the killer into tunneling/camping and lets your teammates easily escape.
---
 It's a strategy. It may suck but it is within the rules.
---
See the problem here?
---
It isn't anymore. He gets bonusspeed when using it I guess.
---
Hillbilly is bullshit two but 5% easier to dodge I would say :D
---
Movie aside, there Is a comic line that goes further than the movie and it is confirmed that maccready never got infected, even after it had another outbreak.
---
Imma spoon
---
Stab me daddy
---
There's other moments where camping isn't a dick move, like when survivors fall for it and basically reward you for it
---
Self care bad
---
Damn. I don't know much about creating a game, but do know a tiny bit about coding. Isn't this a pretty basic type of coding compared to the other aspects in this game?
---
There are 3 different packs available available, they all come with clean icons (idea credit to [u/Monkeymo10](https://www.reddit.com/user/Monkeymo10/)). There are just green backgrounds, just purple backgrounds and a mix of both based on the in game rarities 😊 [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rIH3n3tt3dIJ5x8iCe6eUQbo8mWLYp5u?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rIH3n3tt3dIJ5x8iCe6eUQbo8mWLYp5u?usp=sharing)
---
What is this from?
---
Unfortunately
---
It's Dr fate
---
Honestly, they should really add an animation for his mouth.
---
Because they combo with Dstrike so well
---
It doesn't. I have huntress there but I play billy
---
The movie came out in 1982
---
Meanwhile in body block, T-bag, swf abuse land, the sound of the smallest violin was played in E-minor.
---
Ah Yeah. This js right but it's enough to get you when he is right behind you.
---
Yeah therefore the pallets and windows. But if there isn't any window nearby and all pallets down you are pretty much down.
---
He may be second weakest but when I play him as a sacrifice I kill everybody without add on and perks. He is so easy and therefore pretty strong.
---
I'm playing on console by the way.
---
It’s one of the claudettes!
---
The archive is a mess right now. Broken challenges, insanely hard tasks with shit rewards. Time gated everything. 
---
They are fixing it with oni launch I believe, which means hella more problems before it’s actually fixed.
---
You’re taking this to the next level
---
This needs way more upvotes lol
---
Fengggggg
---
I guess. But then you'll have less time to complete them. It only has 30 or so days left.
---
Someone needs to do an edit of this and put a purple flashlight on the box instead.
---
I need 1 more karma dbd crew
---
I don’t get it. What am I supposed to see
---
You have it on space
---
WHAT
---
Why is everyone in this sub such pussies when they’re new? People in the game are toxic and we understand. We don’t need 500 posts a day saying “asbdbd survivor and killer toxic please nerf I don’t know how to play so I cry over nothing”
---
Oh god the clauddets are evolving now they hide as killer!
---
TIL the "the entire DBD forums when Ghostface was released" is the "same 6".
---
And I'm *pretty darn sure* there are a lot of Survivor mains, or people who are Survivor biased (much more accurate term since everyone thinks "I play both sides" continues to hold significance.) who just don't want to address the real issue behind why everyone switched to Spirit and never switched to another Killer and would rather keep nerfing until... well, it'll never stop. 
---
Whatever Killer they see a lot of will be OP. And every Killer player will just jump to the next Killer in the tier line once their current main is nerfed. Survivors will then scream for nerfs so they never have to see that Killer again, etc...
---
"Parroting the views" is a understatement. Copying their exact wording is more like it, judging by how predictable anti-Spirit people's arguments were... and how easy it was to predict their exact wording.
---
You got down voted because you're a big dummy
---
We don’t got time to’ dis, Ellis.
---
Imagine reposting of Instagram something that was reposted from reddit
---
Did you really need to post this twice?
---
You clearly put a lot of thought into this. It also balances some of the less used perks by giving you incentive to run them. Good work coming up with these.
---
I like the idea of Nurse’s instinct, but I don’t personally think the 5% haste is worth taking over being able to see every injured survivor within 128 meters with empathy 3. Maybe either increasing the haste power/duration or giving it some other plus would make it more viable. Maybe add some effect like Better Together where other survivors can see your aura as you heal your target? Idk
---
I also really like the idea of focus. Its scary not looking around for the killer. It would reward risk taking.
---
Trapped chests is a nice idea that im surprised isn’t in the game yet. I like it!
---
I love a little hindering gas cloud whose effects last moderately longer. Snap that with a Devour Hope and you’ll be ending chases in style. Ha ha hurgh hurgh.
---
Reddit bugged, deleted it already
---
Lel. I see that you don't feel concerned and that you are a non-pussy human being. So why are you commenting here ? You should make better use of your pussy-less time
---
Wdym?
---
His add-ons can make the game a “nightmare” for survivors.
---
Why lithe?
---
Idk why monstrous shrine can’t just be for all hooks I mean it isn’t even that good or at least make basement hooks like 20% faster instead or something
---
*DAAAAMMMMMMNNNNN*

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e4idzd/anybody_wanna_play_some_customs_add_kekecrokec/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
He got a Switch just to play DbD on tour and it’s how he bonds with his daughter, for sure not a coincidence.
---
Just adding, i think it would be better coding-wise to make it like that:
---
"When doing a challenge that needs a specific perk, any empty perk slot will automatically equip the said perk"
---
Because, you know, I doubt BHVR would do your way without giving free perks at some time and then remove the feature for everyone for one week because of "unforeseen circunstances".
---
Then you're lucky, because damn near every red rank survivor whines about one thing or the other when i'm playing
---
Yea what plot holes?
---
We don't need you here
---
He's just a really fun killer, so I hope so too :D
---
Even though I could consider myself a "survivor main", his roars in the distance are very damn cool to go against.
---
Did he actually stream dbd? where can I find it?
---
I hope they will give out some free tiers then. I mean, I can't do the iridescent challenge now. The EGC challenge for survivors is very difficult, and it will take a few days apperently before it's changed. Therefore once I've done the unhooking challenge I can't really go further for survivor
---
Hell ye, thank you
---
Mixer
---
And his Twitter
---
Evidently. But if it's the parallel universe where everything is backwards...
---
I can fell the face camping kids
---
The first half makes sense, I'll totally toss out a Hag/Beartrap or two around a hooked survivor.
---
Fucking standing around tho? 
---
The only time I camp near survivors is when I'm farming BP as Doc. I'll wait around a corner or two and then give em and their rescuer a few zaps before letting them get away.
---
That’s why you take the killer route and go back around. 
---
Either way, there are challenges that take a minimum of 10 games to complete. They only reward 3 shards
---
Idk if this just me, but after game surs just typing "gg", yes, some games i find these complaining in human form, but it's so rare
---
We stan an angery boy
---
I love being super fun with ghostface. Reminds me of the time when two other survivors dc while I was playing for real, so I decided to help the other two with gens. Took them awhile to figure it out but after the match one of them left some kind words on my steam profile.
---
He’s showing his viewers a new game that they might be interested in. I would be happy if I was you
---
Hes supposed to get you when there arent any pallets or windows nearby. If you can’t reach one in time then that means you fucked up.
---
What is swf
---
That's why I will never understand the people who slug randomly with 4 gens up. Like, you only got, at best, 5 hooks and now the game is over. Or survivors who show up with the intent to do 4 gens in 6 minutes to use a key to get out. Why would anyone want the match to be shorter than their wait times?
---
If he loops the killer for ages, its not his fault if no generators are completed, ruin shouldn't be an issue if people did gens and powered through. Hard to see how he could possibly cause 3 seperate players grief while looping, even if a  teamate winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time
---
i mean that’s just how i see it i didn’t out discussion as i’m aware most of my points are really invalid and biased it was just rant i felt like letting off just wish i could see how much downvoted i got
---
I mean the cringy fortnite kids so they can facecamp,tunnel and hiding in lockers, but ok
---
survive with friends
---
I heard he cusses out the killers and say how bad they are
---
Waaaahhhh
---
Every map is killer sides, finds one map that doesnt guarantee 3k or higher... waaahhh
---
I played against a dwight yesterday who did the same thing...I was like *bitch* come back (pls) 😭
---
The amount of times that I’ve got to a pallet, threw it down but got hit by the ridiculous hitboxes is stupid
---
THIS. Can't tell how many times where I've looped the Killer for LITERALLY 5 minutes without a single gen done. The worst part is when you're hooked and see no one's attempting to save you OR doing a damn gen. Why I dispise RR.
---
I mean, I've legit had more matches than I can count where I'm not even fully turned away from the hook and someone comes walking up to unhook like I'm not even there. 
---
Like, the fuck? Do they think I'm going to just let them walk past? The worst is when I slap the creeper and then they sprint over for the unhook anyways. Like, you're literally forcing this poor dude/dudette onto a second hook for a few bp? Smh
---
It just brilliant if it doesn't get many likes re upload it
---
Not op but I remember laughing pretty hard reading this or a similar chapter in All Our Wrongs Today.  Good book.
---
Survivors who typically say this are same survivors who assume that the killer is blind and can't see them obviously while two of them obviously crouching towards the hook.
---
Just because I have a first-person view doesn't does it mean I can't see or hear your attempts to run two behind me.
---
Also for the love of God the whole point come after me trick doesn't really work when the survivor to the left is also being blatantly obvious about the save attempts
---
Also dropping pallets early counters both his powers. If it's a dream you'll realize sooner, and if he is using snares they are almost useless when the pallet has already been dropped
---
Injustice 2. Dr Fate
---
Yes we all do that don’t lie
---
Yeah Stay tf out Ninja. I watched his stream and he’d dc and call the killer shit almost every match.. traaash
---
You see cringy fortnite kids
---
I see more blood for the blood god :D
---
These perks are so pretty!!
---
Woah what universe are you living in where monsterous shrine ISNT S Tier?
---
Maybe after the lawsuit. Maybe...
---
If anything camping is beneficial. It leaves the killer distracted while the other three finish gens. Once the gate is opened they can always go back for the hooked survivor and rescue them. I don't mind when killers camp, they are just helping us win collectively. But whatever helps people sleep at night...At the end if a day, it's still all just a strategic game, pick you poison and shut up about the others. I don't even see half as many killers whine about survivors who body block hooks.
---
One can only hope, he’s my favorite slasher besides Myers.
---
Have you tried playing killer without any slowdowns? 
---
The gens literally pop after first 20 second of chase
---
I'm not against killers getting buffed btw, nor the core game mechanics getting tweaked. It can always be improved, I'm just saying it's possible to at this point in time, play any killer you want and do decently with them somewhat regularly, provided you yourself know how they work.
---
Just wait for the Hillbilly, Nurse and Spirit Archives to come in the future. Oof.
---
Upside, if Wraith is the next one I think that'll be enjoyable too. Little Candle Wick Bing Bong boys running around will be fun
---
Yea, my killer challenge rn is break 40 gens/pallets and I could wait until next week but I'll get 30 now and wait for the update
---
EVERYBODY PANIC *Flips Table*
---
I would have like 4Ks every rank reset.
---
I don't know if I would ever pip as a survivor tho
---
Nothing wrong with any of those things
---
I just had a game where I was actually happy to face a Spirit and not a Trapper. That's just fucked up.
---
You might be on the wrong post
---
I can’t even get to green ranks.
---
I like Ghostface because his stalk ability is incredible once you learn how to use it, and Piggy’s traps are fantastic to put pressure and stall the match
---
Oh.. a Windows edition .. rare like Quentin Mains
---
Last night I t3’d as Myers and hit someone and was going to hook them and a genius tried to body block me (t3). Hooked player 1, picked up player 2 and ANOTHER genius tried to body block me (still in t3).
---
Needless to say it became a 1v1 pretty quickly and the last guy was found pretty quickly as his teammates were dying on hooks.
---
Post game lobby gave me shit for “not letting them play”... like /facepalm...
---
What a weird being.
---
Amen
---
Good point, however I personally don't want to play for challenges. I like to mix playing survivor and killer. If I first have to play killer only, and then survivor only, I will not be playing to have fun, but to complete challenges
---
Eh, end game perks just feel wasteful. I find adrenaline is really only useful if you plan on being in a shit position when the endgame starts. I made it to red ranks never touching adrenaline outside of getting the adept trophy.
---
When I play killer, yes I agree, but I try not to stay long because it’s not fair for the person on the hook! They die because of their stupid team. I imagine myself in place of the survivor the hook, struggling while their team is being dumb dumb; I have been there!
---
it looks so small.
---
oh so freddy now has the FORCE
---
Your wording is awful here but from your comment I'm going to assume you have a misconception
---
Wiggle effects and wiggle time are different things
---
Boil over makes killers sway more while your wiggling, it does not effect the time to wiggle out
---
Iron grasp reduces the effects of wiggling and increases wiggle time, so you sway less and the survivor takes longer to wiggle out
---
Exactly
---
Underpowered? How do you even get away from him without being downed
---
&gt; every map is killer sided
---
Imagine thinking this. Just. Imagine.
---
Occupado?
---
I heard about it from people in noob3's chat. I checked it out to see if it was true lol
---
Considering hook placements in most maps, I think I'll be fine. Also, Mad Grit if they body block
---
Imagine thinking its not
---
Right, I’m in purple now and it IS a little faster to find a survivor match, but I’m not purple killer yet so IDK. This is my first month playing lol
---
Better watch out if you're always playing Legion. Having 2 guaranteed Iridescent emblems every match will put you in red ranks before you're ready.
---
Define cute
---
I don’t understand the people who are mad about it. I think the more he plays it the more the game will grow!
---
Ugh. Fuck those people then. With how long the queue is to get in sometimes idk how the fuck people just stand there for another 5 minutes doing nothing.
---
Don’t think even the devs know how they’re gonna handle it yet :D
---
Yeah but even when they afk they have to stay in the match and can't head into the next match just do the same bullshit again if it doesn't go how they want to.
---
In the end it's about forcing them to stay in-game, or atleast occupy the players so they can't consistently leave a match, enter the next one, and leave it once again within a very short time (which's the whole reason behind those kinds of penalties anyway). So they either have to stay afk, turn the game off and stop playing for some time, OR actually get useful.
---
It's not about preventing salty players from affecting the gameplay entirely, but make it less appealing to them while also reducing the consistenty at which they can do said thing.
---
I managed to convince my Brother to play Killer again after he got absolutly abused by a deranked SWF in his first game.
---
He still "lost"(aka no Sacrifices/Deaths) all 3 games with his new main Legion he played, but he was the happiest since a month, because he´s *"\[...\] finally able to play that cool Killer without hating myself."*
---
As a Brother and DbD Player, this lifted a rather big stone from my heart emotionally since i can finally also watch him play Killer, and not just the other way around.
---
Disclaimer: Please be gentle to baby Killers, they are really fragile.
---
There's no lithe
---
I got a new computer week and a half ago to replace one from 2012. The difference in gameplay is astronomical and I'm so glad &amp; happy I decided to go through with it.
---
What in the actual frick am I reading bruh.
---
A 17 year old nightmare.
---
I never use it but I get a little disappointed when people don't. Like we'll be in a very dire moment of the trial, multiple people injured, one downed, so I pop that last gen and only one guy goes healthy like wtf guys
---
The game doesn't count it as camping so you're factually wrong.
---
I was lucky and got a farming group on first try and have done it in a single match. But now I stuck on heal 4 mates .. had 2 matches in a row with 3 heals and with the update it would be already done -,-
---
Don't forget Franklin's demise
---
Yes please
---
Just bing your bong and it won’t be long till somebody fucks up thinking you’re cloaked
---
Is that new? The only Hunters with map stuff I know of are tied to their powers, akin to the Pig. (Joseph's Cameras, Smiley's parts, etc)
---
That's not how it works. The game thinks one of the killers is a survivor in this situation.
---
Nice downvotes with no response. You are very articulate and capable.
---
This is why sometimes I hate joining people. They always expect you to get them immediately after they go down but then wonder why the killer won’t leave. Just chill on the hook for a bit, and I’ll get you
---
There is no escape,not through death nor through life.The entity probably brought him back to life and back to the campfire,because he was killed and not sacrificed.

No ds should be reverted back like before
---
I thought that too when I noticed we were only 3. The game functioned as normal (except Clown's bottles didnt create any smoke when thrown) but my game crashed after I clicked continue in the post-game screen. I also took a screenshot of the post-game which I can show when I get home

NoEd on a Huntress is a little overkill.

One possible solution could be to put the perks needed on the shrine of secrets for the first week, that would mean if you didn’t have the perks needed, you could grind for them
---
Mmmm yes
---
I doubt the Archives will have challenges that need to be completed by DLC killers since the challenges so far have been base game
---
I don't know ... Scratched Mirror Myers is pretty up there too.

Excuse me? What the actual fuck?

I legit thought this was in game footage for a solid 30 seconds before I realised it was a fucking awesome cosplay!

" I love huntress but at red ranks, you have to tryhard a lot to actually win most of the games and be consistant with her, and some of them are just unwinable from the start (as huntress). " if you are playing at red ranks you should have to "try to win" lol that seems pretty dumb to me wth
---
if you dont want to tryhard just dwell in green/purple ranks and play as you like
---
yeah the game is toxic and there are horrible experiences on both sides (survivor and killer) but dont sit there and say that you shouldnt have to tryhard to win in the highest rank
---
Sometimes I dont use it i use it for the speed

I will tell about this to my friend as this photoshoot came out with really good photos.

Thank you~
---
It really does, it doesn’t matter if he downs a couple of survivors if they already gen rushed and powered the gates.
---
Bubba would like to know your location
---
Just play the game  and you will get there. The challenges also give you a huge boost. I just started back playing a week ago, already on the 5th page. Also if some challenges are hard as a killer sometimes you can get some survivors to farm with you. Keep placing the same trap down and some will get it. I wouldn't do it for every challenge but if some are to hard for you to do. Do that.

It's not. You only hurt your own score when you do this, so unless you report yourself for throwing, you're fine xD

Dang you got to the 5th page in a week and im on the 3rd page in a month O\_o
---
Yeah, he was quite whiny for the whole stream and well, people watch streamers they can relate to. This could be a bad sign
---
Ja, sie hasst Horror xD
---
Not talking about farming, just meming along with the survivor. Like nodding when they do. The little things.

Well I don’t see any blendettes oh wait I can’t see the hatch either.

&gt;#How can I access more Challenges?
---
&gt;Some Master Challenges may also require specific Perks. Any character-specific Perks will be made available to unlock in the Shrine of Secrets, via Iridescent Shards, during various weeks while the associated Rift is active.
---
So the only challenges you're going to be unable to do are Killer specific challenges (Catch Survivors in Bear Traps, Down Survivors with Chainsaw, Get Survivors to T3 Madness, Teleport and hit a Survivor, etc...)
---
Doubt it. They'll just think "what an ass" and move on.
---
Read the caption first then think about it again...
---
That sounds like an interesting idea though
---
Thanks!
---
Better idea: It loans a Tier IV
---
One decided to t-bag at the gate while injured and j managed to grab him, then his friends came and were T-bagging and this fuckin genius who was injured ran right in front of me and tried to unhook him. The last friend kept her distance and was T-bagging furiously. A 1k became a 3k bc of T-bagging idiots 😂
---
r/StabbyGang
---
Bruh I could win that without perks or add ons. Flashlights are a free ruin.
---
Cute, but so was Dahmer as a kid. Claudette is pure evil, regardless of what side you play. She either self cares with sloppy and Thana when I’m a survivor or hides and clicks the flashlight when I’m killer. You ain’t fooling me. Claudette is the only survivor I ever mori.
---
Good
---
Change it to holding a button rather than spamming it
---
Cheat with discord? Care to explain what that means? Genuinely curious
---
Maybe then they could move around the map and players would have to avoid them
---
Well damn with one whole bloodpoint what can’t you get? The sky is limit if we’re talking that kind of currency
---
Oof man.. I can feel that

that idc or give any fucks hey at the end was great
---
DBD has a plot?
---
Daily killer good, survivors bad meme...CHECKED. I love playing bingo.
---
Thats correct I main huntress btw
---
**an all time classic**
---
If I am going by the one level a day progression (70 levels, 70 days), then I am 5 - 6 days ahead. I play on average 5 matches a day, but sometimes only log in to get my daily survivor and killer matches.
---
My best advice for progress besides completing tome challenges would be to at least try to take advantage of the extra XP for your first survivor and killer matches of the day. That's 600 bonus XP for something you might regularly do.
---
Also, think of it this way. If you're at level 23, you've already earned more than 1000 AC in cosmetics, so even if you don't make it to the end, you still came out with value for your pass. You still have a lot of time to get more out of it - if you double your progress by the end, you'll almost be at level 50, which is a good way through the rewards.
---
How dare you post my Myers gameplay without my permission XD
---
Now that's just sweet. Knowing how hard Killer is and how bad of a killer Legion is, it's nice to know someone can get enjoyment with them.
---
Mmmmmm probs a rock hopefully I can bargain with the entity
---
I’ve been doing this my whole life
---
Indeed
---
I probably have this (maybe) but I'll look for it next time I'm on now. That looks super helpful, in the right conditions 😂
---
That’s why you fake the unhook and take the hit. Dumb survivor.
---
DAMNIT ELLIS
---
One time a I was looking at the sky to make skill checks easier and I had no idea what killer it was and a wraith appeared behind me and I couldn't move bc he pinned me 😭
---
Is that territorial imperative? What kind of meme build are you going for?
---
I soemtimes play a Claudette and focus on heals and safe unhooks, doing gens when no one is in trouble. We aren’t all evil, I swear q.q
---
Wat
---
I've been grinding level after level on Nancy and Steve since my parents just got into Stranger Things, and I had a killer who felt bad after a match because he found out I was only a Level 3 Scoops. I had that same killer 3 matches in a row and he farmed every match with BPS.
---
Well before killers could close the hatch there was a thing called a hatch stand off. Basically it amounted to the killer waiting on the hatch as the survivor tried to mindgame so they could jump in and not get grabbed. I recorded a YouTube video where I sat on the hatch for 11 minutes, meanwhile the exit gate was opened directly behind me. The survivor gives up and I grabbed her and I think she DC as a result. Point is, hatch stand offs are awful, I never want to experience that again.
---
Bet
---
Wait, he means 1st of December meaning NoNutNovember just ended? And his army is ready to be deployed?
---
I assume it means having the audacity to talk with each other over Discord. Solo survivors don't have that luxury and it can give SWF groups a pretty large advantage. A coordinated team of high-rank people with appropriate call-outs can absolutely destroy a killer.
---
That said, a lot of (most?) groups are using that advantage to scream into the microphone that Myers is staring at them oh god help. That's definitely what my friends do.
---
Why pay for health care? That's like planning on getting sick/injured.
---
(Seriously, I see this argument in so many games and it's infuriatingly illogical).
---
Obvious dramatization, real Nea is a hunchbacked gremlin
---
But she doesn't have a dog face.
---
Yeah but intentionally being a dick and ruining other people’s experience with the game is not cool, regardless of which role you play. Plus, camping is not beneficial unless the gates are powered, but that’s an entirely different ballgame there. So the only real reason to camp someone is to ruin their experience. Unless they looped a Matt Walker window. In that case, fuck ‘em.
---
No its not, it's a race to find the hatch and then you have the option to open a gate.
---
Me, a rank 14 survivor who got paired with all purple ranks and someone was one of two people who escaped:
---
Pig players tend to suck ass though.
---
Lots of Bloodpoints. Get your boy Steve to P3
---
I like it. The hatch stand offs was the design fault.
---
I'm not sure if destructive ingenuity needs a cooldown, especially one that long since if you're getting hooked that rapidly, the killer is probably being less than savoury anyway
---
Aside from that, this looks like quite a decent set of perks, none are op, yet most have their own niches they fit in
---
You know some people are just trying to have fun with their friends and not cheat right? SWF lets me play matches with my son.
---
"Yeow!"
---
I just had a match as Plague, one of the survivors literally kept running right into me after someone would save them. Naturally I got told to uninstall and that I was tunneling.
---
Ghostface pulled a gamer move
---
the game was built around survivors not being able to communicate but they do anyway via discord if they play survive with friends. this guy is like an angry man yelling at clouds because swf is why the game is as popular as it is. it is an unfair advantage but most of the community has adapted and gotten used to it. most Swf groups are not highly cordinated anyway and often not 4 man teams.
---
...Yeah dude like I said, I don't mind it. It's fair game.
---
Oh my god!
---
Yeah, He has a neutral face when in trial, but has a little grin when he gets away
---
Love your 90 turns. Simple yet  effective.
---
My favorite is when the get the unhook and the person runs right in front of me and says its tunneling lol.
---
Killers who sweat their body weight and try to end the match super quick after DCs make me cringe. Sure, just throw away all those points and waste everyone’s time for nothing I suppose.
---
he jelly of your sick meme.
---
I got unhooked and the killer immediately came back but didn’t come for me. I stuck around to heal and he made his way back this time committing the the kill. It just made me think of how many survivors would call that tunneling.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse'sCalling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
Now I understand how did I lose chase against killer in released year. (fast vault, more pallets, no exhaustion etc.) After passing 3 years this issue still persist for me. Dedicated servers making things good but it still doesn't completely fix it.
---
diabetes strike
---
Go into your settings when you push the PS4 button, go to video I think and one the options is to be “off” or automatic”, this will fix the problem.
---
Sooo good! This is now my second favorite meg cosplay but my first definitely has to be Vinc3ntvega’s pallet peggy version of meg soooo hawt xD
---
If it pukes, it spooks
---
Killer closing the hatch is definetly a good thing. Before that was added, killers could grab survivors out of the hatch mid-fall so the survivor and killer would literally stand there by the hatch until one of them decide to give up. Killer hits the survivor and the survivor jumps in the hatch. Survivor jump in? Killer grabs them out. People legit stood there for hours
---
i feel like meg doesnt look that bad. Just has a wierd gaping mouth facial expression.
---
*AaronPlaysTV laughing*
---
Said video: https://youtu.be/4bqNaoqQeLE
---
She doesn't DC I misremembered
---
God forbid friends want to play with each other rofl
---
Nor is it tunneling otherwise you better get Friend #3 to try and take me away
---
back in my day that would get you three whole perks and you'd have change left over for a flashlight
---
Well im at tier 55 so i think im doing good
---
Maybe that’s what he was trying? I pulled him off either way
---
It was a shirtless David who’s skill did not match up to the risks that he kept taking
---
imma huntress main so i have done this before
---
having the option to see the killer ping again would be a definitely solve 90% of dedicated server issues ...
---
Yeah... play how you want. Some people want to just 4k quickly. Some want to gen rush. Don’t do this, don’t do that. You can do anything you want. There’s no real rules or etiquette. Sometimes I want to screw around and sometimes I want to tryhard. At the end of the day, DBD is not a competitive game, and it shouldn’t matter what others do in it.
---
Ortz is super-boring, though. How he has a streaming career is a genuine mystery to most of us.
---
Why are you posting pedo memes? Dafuq is wrong with you? I hope you stay banned.
---
nah it isnt worst than league of legends, yeah of course there are toxics and such, but isnt so bad, maybe u had a bad streak
---
Adrenaline is the same as DS for me. You may not use it for 4 games, but it's pretty much your only defense if you're the one being chased when the last gen is popped. If you don't have it it's just way too easy for the killer to hard focus then camp you. If you have it your chances of gaining enough time to escape skyrocket.
---
Thats even better
---

Are yours long? Mine are usually around 1-3 minutes.

That's a well deserved ban.

Those perk icons I love them

Congratulations you two, you just failed grade 10.
---
Ok boomer
---
I mean I play killer for the chase, when 2 people DC the survivors have no chance so I either kill one and give the other the hatch or just DC and get into another game because 2v1 isnt a fun time for either side.
---
No, you should’ve gotten a warning at least
---
It's not a hit box issue. It's the fact that there's no mechanic for the pallet being dropped when the killers inside the pallet window. So the killer has to be teleported to one side or the other after the pallet drops. The fact they can still hit you while you're dropping the pallet is by design. There's no reason you should expect to be invincible while dropping a pallet.
---
all of my killer queues are 10-20 minutes what
---
Why dh over bl when using haddonfield offering
---
I'm not saying averyone is...but stereotypes exist for a reason
---
Sounds like a Just ban to me. May you never be allowed on the discord again.
---
You have some nerve.
---
Oh my god
---
The way you're playing right now is good, Some survivors just get angry when all the gens don't get done and they don't escape so they use whatever excuse they can to get themselves to feel better, Killers do this sometimes too and if you're having a problem with gens going to fast start making builds with Ruin or Corrupt intervention
---
Hook them both, nothing wrong with taking advantage of such situations
---
u should never get close to bubba, use spine chill to have an early cue when he coming
---
Is that why I always get tunneled
---
Some people are just doing dailies or grinding out achievements/challenges.
---
gg wp! isn't an insult. It means good game well played. Also, survivors just don't like facing the Legion because it's annoying to have to mend and heal. You mend and heal and then the Legion is running back at you to put you in deep wound.
---
This sub is just stupid. Isnt even funny
---
This would have been a good meme for stalking as well then getting tombstoned.

The new system may not be great but holy fuck were hatch standoffs bad

It’s perfect

---
My friends do the exact same thing lmao, when we do play SWF it's just us ducking around, not trying to be sweaty tryhards or anything, just losing and laughing. My one friend likes to run blind so that he can always lead the killer right to us when hes in a chase 😂
---
Don't know about that, maybe when they  finish with the base ones they start using the not licensed ones(i.e doctor,hag,etc)
---
I had a ghostface shake his head at me the first time he downed me at a pallet. All I could think was that he didn’t deserve that shake. 
---
I then escaped through the hatch.
---
I used blood warden bbq noed and nurses. I managed to hook everyone twice so when it got to endgame, I could find someone on the gate, down them, open the gate, activate blood warden and find the others
---
Chaser points: *go down the drain*

Does anyone know the price ? I want to buy some killers during the black Friday sale, but want to save enough of my money for the new dlc

If you really dont wanna get chainsawed then just stand next to a window. You will probaly get hit the hammer but at least you dont get one shotted.

... No? I dont call someone trash for outplaying me

Well i mean I am. I havent really been playing the game to actively lately. Going back and forth between my bfs house and my moms house. I dont usually get a chance or feel like it to hook my playstation back up as soon as i get home. Hoping to get the switch version.

Nah man, you right. I was hella upset last night. Too many times joining a match only to get camped after going down got to me. I shouldn't complain too much though, it's most likely just the challenges that are causing these kinds of tactics, as it only seems as of late that this stuffs been happening. 
---
 Anyways, sorry about the ranting, your replies were good though. Proving a point without insulting me in any way. So thanks man.
---
Why? That would've just ruined all their fun.
---
Noone expects it on a Wraith and thats why it can actually be good
---
Problem?
---
I get at least 2 kills every game as Legion. I personally thinks he's underrated.
---
Swing chains is really good.  Go for the gen slow perks mostly. Unless you want to go for a cheesy fake pallet build. The fake pallets are not as strong in my opinion but they are super funny when they work
---
Ninja is a crybaby and will bring more toxic people. That's quite bad in my opinion
---
It's simple. You wouldnt get it.
---
Welcome to Dio’s World bitch
---
I hate that interaction, especially since dedicated servers make it super fucking hard to counter play as a killer. Ill literally time it perfectly grab him, and then one of two things happen:
---
1. Grab animation plays and stops half way through turning into a stab.
---
2. Grab animation plays and stops doing anything, so the survivor gets a free unhook.
---
This shit happened before dedicated servers, but its worse with the servers. Happens so much more.
---
OH NO
---
No, these challenges are fucking frustrating when it's just by chance you'll get most of them on top of the grindy ones
---
I wish I could tell you lol
---
Not true. I’ve never seen it.
---
My god i wish i knew how to put these in. Im sure its easy enough but I dont play it enough on pc to worry about the flim flam of possibly getting banned even though the thing I'm modifying is totally benign.
---
known issue
---
cock and ball torture
---
ok i’m on your side now these posts are annoying as shit lmao
---
Thanks
---
Mark as spoiler man C'MOM, the only point of doing those stupid challenges is the event items and the lore.
---
A daily to kill all 4 survivors in 2 minutes? That's a new one.
---
this post is honestly implying OP is finna jerk it to Hag...
---
MAN OF HIGH TASTE I SEE
---
She looks so Meg that at first I thought it was a fan art or something
---
I just bought that skin and I’d say I’m a pretty wholesome player :(((
---
No, it's what you used on me.
---
What are you talking about?
---
[This](https://youtu.be/nOPIu7isD3s)
---
Just had a Hillbilly in a match with a DC &amp; 5 gens left and he randomly started to facecamp &amp; bm my mate
---
Her: Why did you facecamp me??
---
Killer: I know.
---
What do you get 10ks or something?
---
He’s eh. Kind of does the exact same joke all the time. Like him at first but after a few months it didn’t really evolve and his personality is kind of nonexistent it’s just the same joke over and over.
---
Check edit
---
If you're camped, ya dance. If you're not camped, ya stay still.
---
Hhehehe Noobie
---
Vsauce, Michael here
---
The Oni would be the highest mid tier killer imo. Survivor has 1 low tier and 2 mid tier perks imo.
---
Yeah im that guy on the news in nigeria
---
I'm using that skin and I'm not toxic
---
I simply block them on steam as some sort of ''Black-listing''
---
I would be surprised by that shot too after all those misses.
---
I am very excited for the survivor main hurt feelings that will come of this
---
They're referring to the fact that most toxic survivors will call you trash for getting a 4k because they're mad you won. So going off the survivors logic, 0 kill in the match would make them happy since they didn't die, thus meaning that the killer must be "good".
---
TL;DR: Toxic survivor logic is stupid
---
But survivors call me names for using noed and mori :(
---
Marvelous
---
Exactly like commit to the rescue or stay on a gen.
---
I just like that outfit’s baggy pants lol
---
Non the less still a shitty thing to do. That's on you and i don't feel bad.
---
That’s like half of his entertainment. Lol
---
Lmao p3 blendette in her natural habitat
---
But what if I am 0% toxic and still face this, camping bubbas, prayer beads Spirit, and tunneling off hook killers? :(
---
Sure buddy.For the speed.
---
Whichever you find more fun
---
Kill the obsession by any means... Cool encourage tunneling
---
I can’t remember when I last encountered a face camping ghost face. Sorry my dude.
---
Also: hello there fellow shirtless David
---
Like i could send it to you so you can see that it’s not that bad
---
What about exhaustion huntress?
---
When he’s being flat out hypocritical my gf and I start laughing at him but watching his chat support him I’m those moments is the cringiest part for me.
---
Toxic Nea funny toxic Nea funny toxic Nea funny toxic nEA FUNNY TOXIC NEA FUNNY TOXIC NEA FUNNY
---
Camping pallets? Can someone tell me what that means? Out of context it sounds like pallet looping (lets not go there)
---
My throws definitely hit more often at a medium range than close range
---
I mean Freddy is easier to master, either way 2k is below average kill rate but is de-pip central.
---
Nurse. 
---
There are so few really good Nurses anymore that I personally think it'd be more worthwhile and impressive.
---
That said, just play the Killer you enjoy playing the most. Even if it's Bubba or Trapper.
---
just play who you find more fun to play. I've been a Nurse main for the longest time, not because she's the strongest Killer in the game, but simply because I find her so insanely fun to play. If you like Freddy more, play Fredward, if you find Nurse more fun, play her.
---
Rusty shackles with mint rag or disfigured ear?
---
Um excuse me but why exactly did you not chop off your limbs and then command them to float in place?
---
It's the opposite they dont loop the pallets
---
Camping a pallet is just sitting at the pallet waiting for the killer to come and then throwing it down for a cheap stun. It’s really inefficient and a bad strategy alltogether.
---
I always see people use it as a threat. "If you dont come get me now, I will suicide myself".
---
while i agree with you, you didn’t really lay out a proper argument supporting your opinion so you can’t actually expect him to stop
---
Nurse is really satisfying. But freddy is just fun. So might just endup playing both lmao
---
I know that. I’m saying people who aspire to be “toxic” typically watch ochido
---
It's just sitting still on a pallet &amp; waiting for the killer to swing for the survivor to drop it.
---
disappointed that it wasn't rickrolling
---
I'm gonna Mori you
---
If you’re referring to you connecting while your friend is in a match, it looks to me like you readied up while they were still on the previous match’s end game screen 
---
You did this yourself
---
ssssssh i just posted a empty post but looks like none noticed yet
---
This man is a god among killers
---
Are you callinf me bad ?
---
I'll save you right after I get my Emergency Medkit.
---
No Quentin should die without one.
---
Wait so Danny Devito was ghostface the whole time Bhvr well done I be waiting for the new Danny Devito killer (it might not be him but still)
---
I am gonna be honest, just about every time i get hits like these, it cuz on my screen, they do connect and yes I am a killer main if you can’t tell. Good vid tho!
---
Us Jane mains gotta thicc together
---
I know right
---
Body paint color is spot on !
---
If it’s working fine for survivor then it’s definitely not on your end. So many problems with dedicated servers now I’d be fairly confident it’s just them.
---
It’s great though lmao but I feel you.
---
You shouldn't feel that way. 
---
It's a game. 
---
The crybabies will get over it.
---
i personally don’t see the logic behind that; if you’re on the hook, then you need to be saved, so imma do just that.
---
Is that a yes?
---
I keep telling everyone the clown is that weird uncle who has a porno star mustache and smell like cigarettes and pot who still think he somewhat in the 1970s it coming together now with the vhs
---
His aim on huntress is going to be ebic :p
---
I only started playing like 6 months ago but I have had a friend explain what the game was like before. Like broken DS, old Balanced Landing, Old Hatch and how you needed 2 gens when last alive to open it, insta-blind flashlight, or other things.
---
I for one am glad I didn’t have to deal with the hatch standoff. Pretty much I know about old stuff without experiencing it.
---
Damn long neck
---
These would be best if they worked for every person.
---
Imagine a Demogorgon taking pity on a Nea because she had a p3 Demo charm on her.
---
But they get the most scared it’s adorable!
---
Listen I'm not a fan of swf, but it doesn't mean they're cheating
---
Why does it look like the brown thing in my toilet?
---
Survivors are literally 20 plus nerfs deep at this point over the course of the past year and a half.  Devs have been rebalancing survivor and taking away their broken mechanics for some time now.  I'm genuinely confused are you not aware of these because the list is extensive?  I know recently killer has finally received its first balance nerfs in a very very long time but in the grand scheme of things it isn't even close.  Also Spirit was never a high skill killer.  She's a pretty easy killer to play as long as you know the fundamentals of playing killer.  She shouldn't be likened to Nurse in that regard.  Nurse actually took practice and work to play with.  Spirit just kinda needed a headset and someone that wasn't brand new to killer.
---
OP you're obviously new around here. Anything you do in DbD is toxic. 
---
Cosmetics, perks, add-ons, items, characters, doing your objective, being nice; all toxic! 
---
And people who dare to enjoy playing Nea like we do are the worst of the lot!
---
Same thing happened to my Mikey when I got him.
---
Judging by the first two, I'm calling 100% luck on that.
---
It looks like medium vaults are considered as slow vaults and survivors are hit like slow vaults.
---
Then, my question is: WHY DID THEY ADD MEDIUM VAULTS?
---
It doesn't have a hair piece, but here it is with the Lettuce Head, the red Chemosynthesis head, the snake head, the prestiged head, and the basic head.
---
https://imgur.com/a/NrOCMUH
---
Imo he is the 2nd highest mid tier killer. He’s a really good killer.
---
Aaaand its not tunneling if you're injured 
---
Some People wont agree XD
---
Then don’t play or play killer
---
Imagine hitting all four survivors in frenzy
---
DDD
---
Why is everyone calling him Bonk? Did i miss something?
---
people cant have fun with each other while they JUST PLAY A GAME &gt;:(
---
A big NO from me dawg
---
Turn off chat or just get used to the salt because no matter what you do people are gonna be assholes
---
God I fucking hate Pinterest.
---
Idk where you’re from but in the U.S it is 7.99 USD regular price for a dlc pack with a killer and survivor. 3.99 USD when it goes on sale
---
My lord this battle pass is a joke these challenges are so mindboggling dumb, I feel sorry for the poor souls who spent money on jt
---
That’s because we r camouflaged
---
I dont have any real human in it (except a judge some police and a lawyer i think)
---
It’s the point of perks and teachables. You can have that help with perks(ruin) and slowing survivors down .  Can’t be hacked all around and then imagine longer times and adding ruin on then... it’s just getting better for both survivors and killers. Not just about you
---
All I see is a slug
---
U may punch but never kill
---
Dweets always get the hatch, it’s in the rulebook
---
Sould i just delete the post like nothing ever happened?
---
Once you unhoom yourself with deliverance, the killer either dosen't hit you and you get away, slugs your ds and you use unbreakable, or you hit them with ds. No counter to it.
---
We can turn the meta if we keep trying, pink hair Neas will be the bastion of wholesome soon
---
I think you mean two great things. Not one good thing and a so so thing.
---
As a person who gets face camped a lot (and rightfully deserves it most of the time), the things i consider asshole moves is camping a player because someone else looped him hard, or camping because you simply got outplayed. I hate how flashlights are still considered toxic because they arent even that good anymore
---
MONSTROUS SHRINE
---
Not if you play nurse :)

U know how slow huntress is?
---
Is that motherfucker still not wiped from DBD?
---
I scared a streamer as T1 Myers when I pulled him off a gen. His reaction was priceless and his post game chat was hilarious lol
---
Once again, debatable
---
That’s not what they’re saying, there taking the whole trap after survivor shenanigans part of the video and starting a conversation off of it. Which by the way, YES, I love punishing survivors with trapper.
---
If you do need to cleanse, do so near completed generators and not by exit gates. 
---
Plague has a ridiculously strong 3 gen potential, much like any killer, be sure to put effort into completing gens in a sensible order. a 3 gen plague can get people sick, and even if they do cleanse on the opposite side of the map, the pools will run out. The only thing worse than a killer with a 3 gen and everyone broken is a killer that is instantly given a machine gun during that time.
---
Similar to the 3 gen, she has a ludicrous basement game. If more than one person is in the basement and she's not leaving, they're not going to get out. You'll be broken and downed before you can get to a hook, even if healthy when approaching.
---
As annoying as it is to admit, plague is very counterable by immersion. If she can't find you and you never get sick, you can 't go down. If she's approaching the area and you're in a deadzone, it may be far better to hide than to run.
---
If you're in a locker and she pukes on it, you won't get sick unless you LEAVE the locker while the puke is still active. You can wait that out if you wish. A lot of plagues don't realize this, or they may be trying to fool you. I've vomited on a lot of lockers I had no intention of checking, only for a survivor to burst out because they thought they'd get infected, giving me a pretty quick down.
---
If you are sick, don't hide in lockers. But if you get in and out of a locker, it'll stay gross for 30 seconds or so, so you can waste a killers time by jebaiting them into checking empty lockers.
---
It is a part of noob3s video
---
If you're playing to win, nurse. If you're playing for fun, pick whichever one you like playing as.
---
Plenty of people complained about the BL nerf lol where have you been
---
You can have fun without cheating. Circumventing a deliberate lack of comms is cheating.
---
This. This is the wholesome positive community I want :')
---
I think there are perks that slowdown gens, like pop and ruin. There are also perks that prolong long chases, as well as perks that make chases very quick. It’s all about the combination of perks survivors and killers have as well as individual skills, but the fact of the matter is that a killer is the cat and eventually will catch a mouse. 
---
If there are no perks to slow down gens, it takes about 3 minutes for one uninterrupted survivor to complete a gen and 2 minutes for multiple survivors. If there is ruin, 5 minutes for one uninterrupted survivor and 3 minutes for multiple survivors, assuming they don’t always hit every skill check perfectly.
---
If it takes you 3-5 minutes to completely chase someone, you need to work on downing people faster. If there’s consistently one person on a hook, it’s very difficult for the survivors to do anything because they have no communication. If you’re constantly chasing and downing within reasonable time, there’s no need for the gens to be changed. They’re pretty balanced as it is, especially with the right perks imo. And you’re also having lots of fun chasing constantly.
---
This is very true but maybe add borrow time just in case you’re caught
---
Depends what you define defeat as though. Winning and losing seems to be different for everyone, some survivors see escape as the only victory or a killer only sees 4k as winning. Other killers/surviving see a pip as winning no matter if they escape or kill anyone. To me a win as killer is successfully putting pressure on the survivors. If I have the survivors running all over, resetting gens, tricking people, etc. I feel like I had a good time no matter how many escape, and that's a win. Especially cus I take long breaks from this game and my rank decreases alot over that time, so steam rolling people is boring for me and the survivors.
---
If you're solo, and not using kindred, it means "no one is coming, will someone please come" at least that's the assumption.
---
Things like this make me face camp as bubba
---
Give a Quentin main a Emergency medkit today. ;-;

---
*Currently* a wholesome player
---
I did this in an actual lobby and not a custom game so I didn’t have BL
---
Bruh this is legit what happened to me two nights ago. I went to check the hook that the survivor had just been unhooked from and saw him run behind a rock but I hadn’t seen the Laurie (whom I later found somewhat nearby but hidden better). My
---
Options were get the survivor who just clearly ran right in front of me or go searching for a survivor I couldn’t see. Got a salty message right away and regretted my decision of going after the terribly hidden survivor.
---
if you guys get wraith nerfed im suing
---
If you have two people hooked close to each other or one person hooked next to a gen with progress on it, you also really have no reason to leave.
---
They could be doing it to vent. You don’t know what happened to them last match
---
Jesus fuck, that gf scared me at the end
---
So do Overcharge Freddies
---
OMG ruin. It's been in Every. Single. Game. I now run detectives hunch and use the first gen as a point to see where totems are just so I can get rid of that shit. I usually play swf, so I can send a friend in one direction towards a totem while I run another.
---
What the hell is the point in swf if you can't talk to each other? You aren't allowed to play the game with your friends? This isn't cheating, its a feature in the game. Just cuz you got smashed by a couple swf doesn't mean its cheating
---
Now that would be epic
---
Xd
---
Oh...
---
That happen to me lmao, I got 2k and pip but It was scary cuz everyone have 4k hours , and I only have 500
---
Holy frick, this is amazing work!
---
They’re probably just salty they lost to a lower rank killer, especially that rank 4. Also using whispers at tier 2 god you mad lad
---
Well yes, but I noticed that I can't get more than 2 kills without Ruin. So I can understand them. And a good survivor team, almost always beats the killer.
---
Aww yes
---
Lol gatekeeping, pretending you have control over who plays this trash game lmao
---
They've already done this. Repairing gens is now much slower than it used to be, as of about a year ago. They've also got the debuff properly working for when multiple survivors are on the same gen.
---
You're right, staying on a chase for too long can cost the game, but they've also given killers the tools to genuinely oppress survivors at gens. I play a wraith build that usually nets me wins because I spend so much time cycling gens
---
when everyone in Star Wars just uses long bendy arms to fight instead of Lightsabers
---
Literally happened to me today, absolute bs
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it like... 80 seconds to complete a gen?
---
Be right back
---
You mean nothing *right* with any of those.
---
I just had a spirit camp me and their reasoning was because it's not bannable, loving red ranks
---
As a killer main too this makes me sad
---
Redhead’s Pinky Finger if you’re any good at landing direct hits with Clown bottles. Hopefully they’ll leave it alone though. Last thing Clown needs is a nerf of any kind.
---
If there are four survivors on a gen maybe.
---
Two months means two rank resets, probably just because you're at baby killer ranks.
---
Agreed
---
Oh yea I’ll go get it EDIT:here https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Cn1h0A1
---
Doctor? OP? Can't actually believe a human being said that.
---
I completely agree that ochido sucks but the guy in that video is so completely unfunny and pretentious its painful. It's like a Leafy clone but somehow more obnoxious
---
Yeah pretty much. Once you learn a win is actually pipping ( everyone's goal should ultimately be rank 1, but I get that some people play this solely as a party game and that's okay too.) Instead of surviving, you learn the ways to rank up easily. Really if you can work on 2 gens, get a safe unhook, loop the killer for a minute or 2, you'll pip 90% of your games til red ranks.
---
What good is wasting a minute sitting near a hook waiting for the killer to leave? That time could be better spent cleansing a totem to ensure no chance of noed, or working on a gen initially. Sure it's not the most enjoyable gameplay as the hooked survivor, but you have a few minutes on the hook to spare before you die, let your team use it wisely.
---
What good is spending a minute looking for a survivor you think may still be in the area? If you don't immediately find a survivor near a gen, move on. Dont waste time looking in a corner of the map away from gens, if you didn't for sure see someone run that way.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Lmao
---
The chapter is not officially released but they will probably have something and yeah those rips are barely noticeable LOL hoping
---
It’s better than last time
---
This is Hot lol
---
Good solo survivors present a hard early game, but if you can snowball well, the late game is much easier. SWF who aren't using Discord present much the same challenge.
---
Discorded lobbies present an unfun game, because it renders even good killers basically incapable of doing anything meaningful.
---
They would also need to nerf gen slow down perks as well
---
I only solo queue but ive been told before my region is pretty sweaty and i can only go off my experience. I hear a lot of people complain about potato teammates but my experience even in solo queue we get gens done and are out in about 5-7min.
---
Look otzdarva fuckboys downvoted us!
---
Pretty sure I just laughed at him/her and said something stupid. It was a while ago I don’t remember exactly
---
as a survivor main i agree, this wish why if youre being chased you try and lead the killer away
---
No it really is 80 seconds with 1 survivor
---
Yeah how dare I expect a person to have empathy for the other side and not play like an ass.
---
What rank was this
---
*quietly healing* all 4 get marked ABORT MISSION!!’
---
*always
---
It is, I had two rank 20s and a rank 7 and we went against a rank 6, love when ppl bring low level survivors into high rank games and don't teach them shit
---
I see you didn't read the comment. Or did you miss the part where I said the *game is designed to be played with no comms?*
---
You wanna SWF? Fine, but don't use Discord. It circumvents a deliberate lack of a mechanic.
---
Lucky. I get like 2/10 matches were my teammates aren't potatoes.
---
If you don’t like the game then why bother commenting on here
---
Excuse me not self promoting your own vid? Disgusting
---
I just tap. Sure it’s slower but at least I’m progressing the game and not looking around for twenty minutes. 
---
High rank players might laugh at me but it’s better than fucking up the ruin skill checks over and over and I’d rather not ‘just learn how to do it’ because if I’m honest I don’t wanna be high rank anyway, red rank games are just sweatfests from both sides with no killer/perk/item/addon diversity at all.
---
Look, now you just being negative
---
Very clearly *wrong.* It's alright man, autocorrect gets the best of us all somedays.
---
Oh really? Then finish the gen.
---
The way I take it is that you do have to be grinding try hard if you really want everything and that’s not how I play so I am
---
Just going to be happy with whatever I get and try to do as many challenges as possible
---
I did the same to a Bubba
---
I guess they always miss huh.
---
Spirit prayer beads haven't been nerfed yet if you have spirit
---
I recruit the players.
---
I knock one down, carry them to a gen and keep hitting the gen until they wiggle out. Most survivors will clue in something is up and will start working on the gen, then you can grab them.
---
You have to show some trust and respect though, you need to give them a free pass for helping you out. You do get the +15k bp for finishing a stupid tough challenge, so letting that survivor (or group) go escape in exchange is small change.
---
Otherwise you can do it the hard way...
---
He's the third best killer in the game.  That probably upgrades to second best if you're on console.  Buy him and don't look back.  Also he doesn't need addons ever.  Completely optional.
---
Almost every time I play Doctor on console I get accused of playing an easy killer, but yeah, he ain't great.
---
I’m about to post all the salty messages I get from people like that 😂
---
I bought 4 killers from the sale; specifically legion, ghostface, bubba, and myers, and I have been having fun with all of them, specifically ghostface and legion. I’m just happy that I have something new to do on killers.
---
instadown hatchet add-on, more hatchets add-on, and mori everyone add-on
---
So Fin I Kum
---
The higher rank you are, the harder it is to find a lobby I swear.
---
Nah, someone with a lot of hours who can see how fast gens are done. It’s an indisputable fact how fast gens are able to pop
---
It's probably only a cosmetic for Yui sadly
---
Lmao too often. Try sock sniffer
---
its not camping if your teammates loop around the hook
---
why do they do this 😭 its annoying for both sides, killer and survivor
---
Am I wrong? He can prevent pallet drops, end loops early, make anyone near him scream, can make people see hallucinations of him, allowing him to see survivors without the need of bbq, he can make them take time that could be used to heal or work on gens by making tier 3 madness survivors have to "snap out of it", he can make fake pallets, etc.
---
I feel like he’s so underrated. Trapper is one of those killers who you can just sneak up on you at the end of the game. It’s been too many times when I play in games where all 3 or more gens are done and people get cocky. They start tbagging and goofing off. Next thing you know, 3 people get caught in traps like a domino effect.
---
Good meme love doctor fate, still wish we got Constantine tho in I2
---
I feel ya. I’m very casual so I’m the same way. Once it feels like a chore, I lose interest I think or burn myself out.
---
What have you been smoking?
---
Grabs from a window, locker, pallet, or gen while work. Other than that knowledge I can’t give you much else
---
I think there are ways and different situations where it can be camping. Example, if you know other survivors are near but are just staring at the hooked survivor...that's kind of campy. But if your actively searching for survivors you know are there, not camping.
---
I enjoy the meme and think you are mostly right...but there are situations where it can be perceived as camping.
---
I played against a dying light, thanat, ruin and pop plague. It was a fucking nightmare.
---
Making gens longer isnt the answer its already a long ass time to sit on a gen. Id prefer they make some sort of baseline ruin to give killer another perk
---
Would have been if you didn't run into the window for that split second before hand.
---
&gt; spirit which is also a very high skill killer
---
They had us going in the first half, not gonna lie
---
thats not the cause, SWF goes from the lowest level player, so they would be ranked as all rank 4 players
---
They changed the SWF to match with the highest rank so it has nothing to do with SWF. The matchmaking just sucks.
---
I use it as "the coast is clear or safe" because there's a specific guide on the Steam platform that says that's what it means.
---
Apparently, a slow reach up and grab of the hook means camper. Mind you you can spot the killer most of the time.
---
I like your name
---
I was spamming it but my RB decided it wasn’t working
---
It's actually extremely easy to get those if you move correctly. Just because you're invisible doesn't mean you shouldn't still use cover to move to the survivors.
---
What will really kill your chances is the bell sound. You'll need a Bone or Coxcomb Clapper in order to actually pull it off.
---
Just because november is over, you don't have to go back to being a degenerate.
---
Im thinking its just really bad connection, survivors cant lagswitch even more dedicated servers
---
It is oddly the hardest challenge
---
You don’t always need to rush for the hatch when it becomes available. You’re basically gambling life v death on finding the hatch first - It’s luck based.
---
Unless I already know where the hatch is I head to an exit gate when it comes down to hatch. When the killer closes the hatch, I’m already at the gates, opening them immediately.
---
Will usually escape just fine but does depend on gate placement.
---
Does grabbing a trapped survivor from a bear trap count?
---
Oh, but still, it's just bullshit
---
Yasss awesome cosplay!
---
Its fine, if you as a survivor cannot power the gens or find hatch before the killer it should be very very hard for you to escape.
---
Ehhhh.
---
Since dedicated servers 80% of my grabs looks like this.
---
Don’t spend it all in one place :)
---
I still see plenty of self-care.
---
I had a game that wasn’t going very well. 3 gens popped after the first chase. I got the 1st guy by tunneling him off the hook. When the EGC kicked in I had a hook near one of the gates. They went for the most unsafe hook rescue ever. 1 of them slugged. One dude went for the unhook as soon as I hooked his buddy so I just grabbed him and hooked him. 
---
I never ever have seen flashlight clicking Nea squads be *that* salty in the endgame chat. They kept going on and on about how “you deserved 0 Kills you trash killer”
---
i don’t play on PC so that knowledge isn’t very universal
---
I play both survivor (survivor more) and killer. Honestly it isn't your job to make the game fun, it's your job to kill the survivors so they can't escape. From what you're saying you play completely fairly so it isn't your problem whether or not they like how you play. I learned to stop being super nice to survivors when I started to let people go at the end and they send me hate mail saying they didn't need charity and that I suck at spirit. Just because I say this doesn't mean to be an asshole either. (Felt the need to put this here for the people that could potentially react negatively to this for some reason.)
---
Either way, it remains the same. There are perks to help chase and perks to slowdown gens. If you’re constantly downing survivor after survivor and keeping them busy, there’s no time to do gens. Especially if there are perks preventing them from doing the gens.
---
Or... It forces you to play other characters with other perks, forcing you to play differently even further. 
---
I don't have NOED on most of my killers apparently. I was forced to pick a different killer than I wanted to use and do a whole new set up with what that killer had available just to make sure I got use out of it and didn't throw the game
---
Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean that there isn't any logic behind it. Some players are quite selfish and will leave you on the hook so they can escape without putting themselves in danger.
---
Get rid of Beast of Prey, add in Dark Devotion, The Beast add-on, and you've got an actual fun build.
---
- People hear you through cloak.
---
- Dark Devotion makes the Obsession think you're directly on top of him after you hit him.
---
- Insidious causes your terror radius to go away.
---
The amount of times I've run to the obsession, he runs off, I stand still, he comes back, I smack him and he goes flying off in a panic is far too hilarious. You have to see it to believe it.
---
I let a killer grab me last and they let me wiggle. I pointed at the gen and worked til they grabbed me. Rinse and repeat. I just assumed they had the challenge, and just kept feeding them grabs. Apparently i was correct and they messaged me thanking me a bunch.
---
I feel like people are way too black and white about cleanse or not cleansing when a lot of it is really situational. If you got puked on and there's still 5 gens and you haven't been hooked yet, definitely don't cleanse. If you're on last hook and there's only 1 or 2 gens, it's probably safe to cleanse. Whenever I do cleanse, I'll usually do it at a fountain near a finished gen and away from an exit gate. Plague can be very strong if people cleanse too much, but I feel like she can be equally as powerful if people don't cleanse at all with the right perk builds.
---
Damn
---
Don't let them deceive you bröther, all Claudettes want are lööps.
---
I dont feel like hes underrated personally. His traps are awful on some maps, and without addons they're too easy to see on others. His setup takes way too long and it's too easy to destroy his setups. Mostly though it's just that it takes so long to go across the map to get traps, so you dont really even get to make the most of it
---
However, you're not wrong, I think. If he does get a good trap or two it can snowball really hard really fast, especially if he can hook them in the middle of his labyrinth. I don't think he's a great killer, but he definitely doesn't seem like the worst. I think he's just very situational
---
All my opinion, of course
---
fml it’s like being a vet with PTSD watching this. I’m triggered for you.
---
Thanks got it for My Birthday
---
I mean yeah, it's good for newer players but 100% not meta.
---
This might convince me to prestige
---
And a Mori
---
1. I would hope that if gen speeds were addressed theyed be able to completely change ruin 
---
2. This isnt a call to action, im not suggesting gen speeds be changed per say i just wanted to get other peoples opinions on the matter 
---
3. Thank you for the input!
---
Thank you ^^
---
Nah. It’s those blue haired Fengs you gotta watch out for. Ive never met a blue haired Feng that wasn’t toxic af.
---
No go back to fort nite 2 thanks
---
Dude, you did the right thing. They deserve the hook
---
I usually just break the pallet
---
Yeah I get it was an opinion and your perspective on it. I respect that
---
Maneuver in a way that doesn't allow that
---
By and large the problem with gens (and most of the survivor gameplay) is that holding down M1 and doing quick time events is the worst. One of the biggest problems I had when I first started the game was how repetitive and boring working on gens was (it still is).
---
If they want to make the game more interesting, more side objectives like during special events would be better to extend the game.
---
Except you only have 4 perk slots.
---
Your comparison isn't necessarily fair because no one is saying Adrenaline/Endgame perks are *useless*.  But there are a lot of people who think the cases in which they are clutch aren't worth the 4th slot that could go to something else.
---
If Adrenaline is only useful in say, 1/4 games, it might not be worth it instead of perks that will help in all 4 games (and might prevent scenarios where Adrenaline would be necessary anyway).
---
A more apt comparison might be when someone who is in a dire financial situation is picking between Food, Rent, Utilities, and Health Care.  While they would, ideally, like all four, if they can't afford them all Health Care is the logical one to drop because there's only the *possibility* they'll need it, as opposed to the others where they *definitely* do.
---
Is that... is that a Roblox locker?
---
I literally only play Ghostface to befriend survivors. It doesn’t really work
---
How despicable. You truly are the lowest scum in history. Have my upvote, and let me hope i never have to face you...
---
People really overlook how many first hits you get due to wraiths stealth. It lets you find the weaker members of the team who try to stealth.
---
Base wraith kinda lacks due to no map pressure, if he was a bit faster while cloaked hed be way better
---
&gt;is a broken killer like spirit or doctor
---
To be fair, you did literally say that.
---
Don't need Iron Will if you're using Urban Immersion to avoid ever hearing the heartbeat of the killer!
---
Either I bring in a brown item or nothing because every time I even try to bring in something yellow or higher, my team gets crushed and I can’t use it
---
This "hamfisted" mechanic changes a lot that was wrong with hatch standoffs. You don't like that, then bring a key... You can just open it right back up in front of the killer if you'd like.
---
Idk why people are focusing so much on adding him into dead by daylight after all the complications with his OWN game  so
---
Yeah when balanced landing gets nerfed, ima go back to using dead hard and maybe try out lithe to see how it feels.
---
You have to do gens. Just look at what happens in maps that have infinites without balanced being needed.
---
I have been thinking this same thing I knew I wasn’t crazy when I thought all the hairstyles suddenly changed and look worse
---
Puppers
---
I've heard many people complain about killers camping the hook, but there are enough pros/cons to it, that it shouldn't be complained about. For example, a killer that waits at a hook is simply wasting time to guarentee one death, since it's unlikely that survivors would risk that rescue. During this time, the rest of the survivors can be working on generators, without necessarily being worried about the killer. I think the only case where a killer waiting on a hook is purely beneficial to them is when there are a high number of generators and a low number of survivors. In this case, a person down is worth a generator. This situation is only a result of a poor game by the survivors, and therefore should be utilized by the killer if avilable.
---
The oni is better and cooler than the hillbilly in every possible way, except the start of the game
---
decisive strike if your family catches you
---
Spirit, Billy, and nurse. Spirits mind games are beyond good. Billy has fast mobility and a 1 hit on command. And nurse can skip through loops. Oni is close to them but having to recharge his power is what holds him back.
---
This is fairly easy I think. Just injure the survivor and follow their tail till they hop a window or pallet. If they get confused and stop, go to one and smack it....maybe spare that one after if you require that bit though.
---
Whats the point if theres 4 more generators to complete one of us is going to die might as well get 5000 blood points
---
The blood drops indicate a general direction of where to find the survivors and the oni can do some weird 90° angle when he strikes
---
Nope, Just a designer who knows better.
---
I do agree he is cooler but he is not stronger than the hillbilly.
---
You know those over confident survivors that are so clueless. They unhook their teammate's that just got hooked without borrowed time. So their just farming and thinking their 514th rule is applied where the killer needs to ignore the survivor that immediately gets unhooked right behind him.
---
im litterally rank 8 and i dont renember having a game where the survivors didnt have atleast 1 red rank in the last month idk what is going on

Hahah the downvotes. You guys all gay for that man.

It works perfectly fine on level 1, the distance is the same
---
In his current state on the PTB, Oni is 100% a high tier killer. I'm assuming he won't go live on Tuesday untouched from the PTB, but he'll still probably be high tier regardless of what they do to him. For his perks, 1 is to help new players learn the game, and the other 2 are only good on very specific killers, otherwise I'd say they're pretty bad. I can't really comment on survivor perks, they all might be ok, but I don't see any of them as strong or even that good.
---
Watch some streamers/YouTubers play him and you'll see how nutty the Oni is. If you are on the fence about buying it though you could wait and see how he performs on live servers, assuming they nerf him a little from the PTB.
---
I can appreciate him not getting pissy. People pull this then turn around and say killers tunnel and are overpowered.
---
Oni has much better mobility so you are trading power outside your ability to be BIG during it. It's like Billy yes, but much more loaded.
---
While Billy is a steady output. Oni has a window to wreak havoc.
---
In fact his power level is so insane during demon mode that I'd say he is better right now. The blood drinking isn't that difficult. You force survivors to heal which slows the game down while being an instadown killer (there is a saying not to heal vs the insane Billies)
---
She's a thicc man - you not hear her grunts? I played her once - was looking around for a dude near me.
---
If the killer has all 5 stacks that's usually the end of the game that's more like 
---
"A soul for all 4 or you find the hatch"
---
The game isn't specifically designed for people with no comms. The game is designed fro people to play however they want.

That’s cool but I wanted to win every match I’ll just pick billy. He has so much map pressure compared to the oni
---
He doesn't place them himself but fake ones appear around him if he has order addons
---
When do Oni / Yui get released?
---
Not talking curves - talking that nasty man breath she got.
---
I completely agree
---
Yeah cuz I play 1 and a half a day
---
Talking that adams apple she got.
---
I feel like dbd needs what rainbow six did and just have a operation health to fix the hit boxes of stuff and other bugs.
---
Then fix the infinite not BL
---
This is a family friendly environment so no f bombs no s bombs no c bombs no s bombs no n bombs
---
By that logic, playing against an aimbotter should be more interesting. You just need to "plan ahead" and "outplay" the hack.
---
Oh wait... it isn't.
---
I do agree with you but I still think the pressure the bill can put on survivor is much more than oni
---
Why is there a difference between a sports game and DBD in the specific context provided? I "called you names" because of your flippant responses thus far, including dismissing anyone who disagrees with you as engaging in a circlejerk. Very constructive, that.
---
How would your original suggestion of dragging the game out even longer by smugly taking them to the hook, dropping them, and then returning them to the gate "help the community"? If anything, that's *more* toxic and smug on the part of the killer and also provides zero deterrent to future shitty behavior.
---
FYI: I don't play DbD. I watch content of it. As such you may find my opinion worthless, but as an outsider looking in I find your perspective to be intrinsically more harmful to the game's culture than the killer's actions here and even the survivors featured in his/her vid.
---
you can never win with them. if you're somewhat nice they dc, if you play normally, same thing
---
I AM SCREAMIN1111111!!
---
What about console users just being in a party? Or is it only cheating when you’re on PC?
---
I won’t do it if:
---
1. NOED is active and I couldn’t find it
---
2. The killer is camping or patrolling too close and I don’t have BT
---
3. The teammate was useless the entire game (not doing gens, leading the killer to other people, not healing, etc)
---
Edit: By “it” I mean I wont get the person off the hook
---
@Deso7 I was listen to Tech N9ne - Fragile and it made this compilation amazing, great editing btw.
---
*equips bbq and chili also for good measure*
---
Of course i disagree, haddonfield and some other maps are unplayable because of balanced landing. And no, you can't just leave everyone and go for gens every single time, you will get genrushed
---
Thanks alot! Yeah i think freddy is the one.
---
Devs were nerfing both sides soo it was getting more balanced
---
Devs started nerfing killers again soo we gotta complain
---
All you guys get is a perk nerf while we get 3 killers nerfed
---
The 3D model of Azami was created by Laura Peltomäki.

Please take the time to check out more of her amazing work on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/laloon/profile).
---
Usually it’s not too bad for me but the last couple of days it’s been ridiculously long to the point I give up and play something else
---
Baby Yoda just wants to destroy some survivors.
---
No it isn't. It's designed to be played without comms. Otherwise, the developers would have, you know, put in a way to communicate during the trial.
---
Honestly, just having your other killers minimum rank be within one rank color of your highest one would be okayish I think. Like the minimum rank your other killers start at if you're a red rank killer is 5, for example. Kind of like a rank reset, but a little bit further.
---
Its not 9001 so it doesn't count.
---
I think in the next week or two
---
Ok, why don't you go ask a Dev in the dead by daylight forums? Screenshot the results and send them to me.
---
That is so cool!
---
Yup, same thing. Party mics should be disabled while DBD is running, but MS/Sony probably don't allow game devs to go dicking about like that with their OS.
---
You can get rank 1 with every killer if that's your concern. Wraith is in a pretty decent spot right now
---
Balanced landing for sure is really strong on some maps. But the change for it now just makes it a very weak perk.
---
For although it won't be a bad perk on Haddonfield and some other maps, it'll just be even worse on maps it was already bad on.
---
The only good one is the boil over tweak, the others I just dont like
---
Completion is OP as fuck, no thank you
---
He needs time to set up his portals and his shred isnt very good
---
Yeah, it's so undeniably better than all other exhaustion perks, even in shelter woods. /s
---
It does seem like a good tool to use for camping killers though.
---
I mean if you're scared to ask the very people who created the game, that kinda validates my point
---
It’s a good thing I have a utility flashlight combined with an odd bulb and high sapphire lens for blinding whoever watches me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
this is cool as fuck
---
Alas. ~~I mean, you probably wouldn't even need to dick about with the OS, I'm sure there'd be a way to just have the game not receive any mic input at it's own layer. Like, sure the mic is on, and the OS is picking it up, but the signal never reaches the game.~~
---
EDIT: Wait, no, that's not how console parties work, is it? Doi.
---
Well, he has this big ol' club (Kanabo), and he bonks people with it. Thus he has become Bonk or Bam Bam or anything in between. :D
---
There are multiple people within the community who hit rank 1 and you can find them in random swf parties. No ranking system unfortunately
---
One map compared to 12 other tile sets is a really bad comparison my friend.
---
Well, you can’t escape until some gens get done
---
Yes, they're both valid tactics if used right, I don't see whats funny about it
---
Thank you!! Flames are difficult, but really fun to draw :D
---
I just thought there was some strategic that I didn’t know, but hey no one said a word about portals and how it’s hard to deal with those
---
Had to Prove Thyself all November, now it’s time for some Self-Care :]
---
SWF =/= cheating. SWF + Discord = cheating. Subtle but crucial distinction. I've no problem with people playing in groups, that's fine. It's when they circumvent the intended lack of communication that's the problem.
---
next to ur Hex Totem... pepesad
---
Yeah I was so happy when she gave it to me ^~^

WOW, what a burn... Damn, I feel so dizzy I think I'm losing my Yugioh points. For your information, you can climb the side of the main tree in shelter woods and activate BL.

EDIT: I don't think there's much information going through that thin straw in your nose so I'll leave it at that.
---
Weak killer, terrible unique perks, paid DLC
---
Dec 3rd
---
Nope
---
Borrowed Time  would be not having time for it but you’re just like fuck it anyway lmao.
---
Having a dead perk slot in some maps is very bad.
---
The photo was taken at the festival, no retouching at all.
---
Fair lmao
---
Wow, nice ad hominem. Your sophistry is very rhetorically persuasive.
---
What are u talking girl , I just enter to their profiles and saw that they have 4K hours , lol
---
Anything is toxic
---
Clown is a coomer
---
I agree. I demand to see Dart alot more.
---
1) Expensive DLC that doesn´t really bring many great perks
---
2) His own perks are terrible, so he isn´t really worth levelling for teachables
---
3) He is hard to play and even if you know how to play him you don´t demolish the survivors like some other killers (Nurse for example), you just do well, but need much more skill and nuance than other killers that can do just as well with less tryharding. So most people don´t bother.
---
Been playing for about a month, barely play killer but I’m rank 11 and consistently get 4Ks with ghostface just aimlessly running around chopping people. Don’t get how killers just sit by the hook and *ruin* the game.
---
Usually the secret offering is from that one survivor who uses Vigo's shroud because he's too scared to be chased by killer first.
---
You're*
---
Lol, "scared". Okay.
---
If you won't actually discuss the point with your own arguments, and just demand "Word of God", then you're not really discussing the issue. Your point isn't validated just because I won't waste my time asking a question that:
---
* a) probably won't get an answer anyway, and
---
* b) the answer to which can easily be extrapolated by the game's very design, and the fact the devs have made no mention of ever including such a feature.
---
Good suggestion, I'll try it.
---
Killers need to play without sound, perks, or a monitor, otherwise they are cheating, and it's not fair.
---
You’re acting like every player isn’t already salty in post game chat
---
That may differ on different platmors or in regions as well ^_^
---
Hey man, just like with hitting skill checks in the first place, it's a learning process, y'all can't just install the game and immediately know how to do it. Far as people refusing to learn and wasting time looking for totems and not being experienced enough to know where to look, yeah, that's pretty annoying, but that's life, and for some, how they learn.
---
Thank you for your insight, I thought that was the case with goose I can never get killers to act the way they do in his videos. Also you did mention you watch Korean streamers is their any you recommend for a beginner to the game?
---
Oni going to be top tier
---
Well..... not exactly weak. He is semi-good and not complete trash. His portals do get fucked extra often though and i feel like closing a interdimensional portal to a reflection to our world SHOULD take a bit longer to close. Surge itself is pretty trashy no doubt, Cruel Limits is okay (if you want gens getting done) and Mindbreaker under very specific times comes handy (AKA never)
---
After you reach level 100 it resets back to 1 and gives you a ‘devotion’ (number signifying 100 levels) maybe that’s what you’re seeing?
---
more reason why to blend it
---
He’s very weak, low mid tier
---
Hop on ghostface, im usually able to gen grab very easilly
---
I play Nea with that only when I want to give the killers a free kill :)
---
Rank reset happens every month, bringing higher ranks down considerably. Another way to tell are players with prestiged characters (the ones covered in blood). Once you get a feel for the game it won’t matter as much.
---
Shred is okay as it is, portals are holding him back a bit which is a shame.
---
I love cleansing null totems
---
This is pure gold
---
Let me guess when you do find a single survivor you just tunnel them.
---
You should
---
the first thing i do is cross the map, tending either to the left or right side as i go depending on which corner is further.
---
No I don’t act like that. That’s why I said we already have enough toxicity in game, and we don’t need any extra or additional toxicity due to some fortnite streamer who has 9 year old toxic fan base. Read my comment carefully.
---
This. Not even joking. If you have Ruin survivors guaranteed to spawn on one of the gens near the totem.
---
What? How the fuck do you get that from what I asked?
---
I do the teabag as a way to like kneel or bow. Hopefully killers realize that I'm not trying to be a dick.
---
Edit: To clarify, I really only do this if I'm the last survivor and the killer has me in position where I know I'm not getting away. 50/50 chance on if the killer helps me survive when I do this, so I think most realize what I'm doing.
---
why do u need a perk build just need 0 perks and 0.000000001 grams of a brain to win with plague
---
what does ruin level have to do with it? It doesn't decrease the skill check zone per level lmao.
---
I guess if i can't hit the final 10% skillcheck that keeps popping up 5 times in a row at the hardest part till the 5th time i should uninstall.
---
For me it’s the fact that there are better killers and I haven’t put too many points into him yet so he has shit perks.
---
When Wraith is so quiet that you can't even see him...200 IQ plays
---
definitely one of the coolest concept killers i’ve seen on this sub. awesome job.
---
I mean, you still won't ask the devs. The people who designed the game.
---
Giving up BT or Adrenaline isn’t going to balance out a killer not running ruin. BT can be countered easily, Adrenaline only works end game and often isn’t that great. Neither is anywhere near comparable to how good ruin is if it stays up more than 10 seconds. There are already few enough good gen slowdown perks anyways. Just gotta get better at hitting great skill checks. At that point ruin is basically a worthless perk.
---
That’s irrelevant bc you can differentiate between survivor/killer offerings, the backside of the killer’s offering is darker than the backside of survivor’s.
---
Depends on what you’re playing on too. On console it’s much harder to do since the frames we get are drastically lower and even on PC, some people simply can’t do great skill checks every single time. It’s no big deal
---
2 minutes of nobody doing a gen because you downed one person lmao, get fucked this is broken as fuck. 
---
Maybe if it was one time a game it could work but 2 minutes is hella long for survivors to do nothing. You aren't gonna get downs they are just gonna immerse themselves into lockers and corners of the maps since they have nothing else to do.
---
Baby hand Freddy op
---
“Just go for someone else if they’re using the infinite”
---
Lol that comes across as if the infinites aren’t a massive fucking flaw in the game.
---
I never play killer so when I started playing killer again I was at the lowest rank. Still took me a good 5 minutes just create a lobby
---
Some of them, yeah, but no way that's the average lol. Sometimes i think i'm playing against a swf with a rank 15-20 survivor. And surprise! HE IS RED WTF
---
I was thinking installing the parts would be the "working on the generator" portion. Like after installing all parts you can just pull the start and be done with that one. But agreed, there does need to be something else for the survivors to do that is actually meaningful and worth going after.
---
Switched it to 90. Dont know why i put 120 lol
---
Anywhere near a gen at least 1 gen distance from you.
---
Most of the time you have good success just going to the other side of the map since the chances are better that way but sometimes all 4 spawned right next to you and by the time you come back its popped.
---
That's what you're suppose to do if you're an actual good killer. If you keep chasing the survivor thats using an infinite, you're going to lose because you will never catch him.
---
For some reason its actually to grab survivors off totems than generators. When letting go when cleansing a totem, you can still get grabbed mid-animation.
---
Ah ok. I feel like 8-10 is the rank that the most complaints come from
---
The concept is similar to Friday the 13th, where you need several parts to start the car to escape.
---
Insulting the community isn't gonna help with the downvotes.
---
90s is still pretty high.
---
Would be best at 30/45/60 and its still bad because all it does is delay the game and you can facecamp a person to 2nd state or death from 2nd for free since the only thing they can do vs a facecamper is do gens, which guess what, you blocked.
---
1/14 is a good chance it's not a dead perk slot. 
---
But if you really want to use this argument, the same applies to hex totems. Or any situational perk, or even killers with bad mapsets.
---
If any given perk functions better then any other perk 95% of the time, it's too good.
---
The time for the blocking seems way too long
---
corrupt intervention is the closest perk to this concept , however it is both *at the start of a game*, and only blocks 3 gens, this has 5 activation occurances, blocks all gens and lasts for the same amount of time.
---
I watch nozerobeethree. and I don't aspire to be toxic.
---
Sadly, "Save 2 survivors while EGC is active" exists (but the devs said that they will reduce the number of saves from 2 to 1)
---
Well atleast we can say she went out with style
---
Ace in the Hole

# 😳
---
I actually use it
---
Yeah probably not but I just want it to be better. It's like it has a good foundation but it's not fully there yet. The potential for greatness but I was just kind of good for now.
---
Not a survivor main btw. I'm halfway to devotion 4 and play both sides half and half.
---
Same post over and over and over again
---
Maybe in terms of rarity tier, but as for utility? Hard pass. I'd rather buy 3x brown batteries than a single Odd Bulb.
---
It is a hard skillcap killer and not a very good one, even more, on PS4 at least there is a very hard lag when playing demo, making things more difficult
---
Not gunna lie, when I see a Nea with that head I assume the same thing.
---
I doubt ps4 would be all to different from xbox. PC is a different entity but I can check that as well
---
No one “purposely misses” a hatchet what kinda reverse psychology bullshit attempt is this

***Trapper got beat by a survivor along the name of u/derAnnigga. All survivors and killers will not be able to see the Trapper for an estimate of 7 days.***
---
&gt;The concept is similar to Friday the 13th, where you need several parts to start the car to escape.
---
And how is that concept going so far for F13th?
---
I know you can get rank one with every killer, but I'd never think of wraith as a top 3 killer.
---
They'll be on the opposite side of the map from you.  Just patrol the furthest gens first and you'll find them.
---
Diagonally across from you from where you spawn
---
While i disagree with him on that, billy is not that great in my opinion, every good survivor can run a billy around for a solid amount of time.
---
Mr bean?
---
Plus the ability to juggle makes it good, using Nurses calling on stealth killers can be very deadly.
---
This is at the sametime balanced bur a little to op for killers
---
LMAO, people actually think that Demo is a bad killer XD
---
How can you possibly die without dropping it? Force them to locker grab you?
---
EVERY. TIME.
---
My favorite is when they call you a camper but you have zero proximity to hook points lost. Maybe if you all weren't farming your team mates and all in the same spot on the map I could leave!
---
That greatly depends on the killer you play
---
Fengs fringe is different colour than the rest of her hair too :/
---
I'm saying casual play not sweat fest freddy. Every freddy I've gone against are the definition of sweat.
---
i don't think that makes much sense, white masks are usually for women or the rich iirc
---
I dont know, ask fucking Jane.
---
Can we talk about the amazing transitions? And the fact that he was mori'd right infront a kate that casually got the 4% LMAO
---
maybe &gt;_&gt; it was too hard to find a transparent picture of a coloured locker on google images lol
---
He looks methed up
---
Agree, getting to rank 1 is not that hard. But his idea of viable is "being able to control the game, even against a swf" the only thing he thinks Wraith is bad against, is infinites, just like ghostface.
---
Unpopular opinion: n0ob3 isn’t toxic.
---
Oh no a streamer who plays a game I don’t like is playing a game I do like!!!!! Now good game become bad game!!!!!!! This is so sad can I have Reddit gold
---
He is in the middle, not bad, not good
---
"can't fix a gen with gen" dang, I guess we all suck.
---
*You're
---
I faced that exact build for no reason, in low ranks
---
There was absolutely no reason to be that sweaty, and she still slugged for the 4k
---
Like 80 or so
---
Is anyone having issues for bypassing optiming game
---
They mean David
---
Or better yet trade items brtween survs
---
When I hopped into this thread I scrolled all the way to the bottom to look for a comment with an overwhelming amount of downvotes just like this one. I knew it had to exist on this post. Thank you for not disappointing me in my expectations.
---
Yeah, that's also shit. I had the exact opposite as killer but it's both just utter shit.
---
My build was noed, nurses, distressing, and surveillance
---
Still makes me jump when it's in a place that makes no sense to me as a veteran player
---
nope dont see the problem, again the game is more intense and challenging if they got comms and can call out what you are doing. But I am a pretty competitive player who like a good challenge so this is just my opinion :&gt;
---

Skeemoo did a render of the oni and yui, the oni render starts at 3:00 and after 10 seconds changes just the mask to a white one
---
Ew lol, her spooky open mouth!
---
he really isn't aside from his, "Once Upon" series. and even those aren't exactly toxic. I mean if you're good enough at the game without blinding the killer every 2 seconds and tea bagging every pallet, I don't really think it's toxic except for those two main things. it's more so postgame and pregame chat that shows who's truly toxic.
---
Why would you play with your friends and then not talk together?
---
Yes I know that some assholes really abuse it to be sweaty tryhards, but most just have fun and fuck around
---
I hate when I spawn near a Hex totem without realizing it and the Killer is immediately on my ass like I threatened their child.
---
Bitch, I didn’t even know it was there!
---
He's a great killer, but the problem is that for want of a better term, he isn't very flashy. His teleport is a more time consuming version of what Freddy has, and although powerful, the lunge isn't exactly the most innovative thing.
---
That being said, it's a shame he's not played more. He's fun, good without being too easy, and genuinely piss scary.
---
Me neither. We practically download the entire game again every 6 weeks anyways.
---
Hard disagree.  Red ranks are where the saltiest assholes live.
---
This video WAS good, then the ending made it perfect
---
Cosmetics by themselves are fuckin expensive. It's actually a bit of a deal.
---
i guess. i'm not a god of knowledge either so i'll take that over my own memory.
---
This happens me all the time when all the team is running for the hook. They give me shit and i just reply ''All of you were jerking off to that hooked one running around. Sorry for playing the game that i have spent money on'' I always have that a Copy/Paste
---
How did you die out of all rank 20s and with a rank 13 killer?
---
okay
---
not wanting new people to play the game because ninja cring kids bad
---
That would exclude like 12+ killers and survivors each then... The base game roster isn't that big you know.
---
If they want the tomes to last, DLC characters will eventually have to get tomes centered around them.
---
“If I’m not going against a camping, scrubby ass tunneling killer...example, there’s a face camping Plague” literally all that was said about killers. Just shut up already, you’re making yourself look like a bigger fool with every comment.
---
Killer queue times are just really long, I've noticed that they're a lot shorter really late at night
---
I say it should be the 3 closest for 15/30/45
---
There was 2 people on the hook and 1 downed and as I was saving someone I got knocked down and the person I saved didn’t even run and I ended up killing myself

Try that. Also try restarting your computer and make sure everything is updated. With everything perfect I average a 10ish minute wait.
---
I don't think it should be more than 60 at Tier 3, and I don't know how exactly you would make that Obsession thing work, especially since no matter what, if there's gonna be an Obsession at all, it will already be at the start of the trial. Unless it switched at random after every gen, which wouldn't be that viable, I don't really see how it would work.
---
9/10 if the survivors tried and weren’t being toxic I usually let the last survivor escape through hatch. Unless there’s a challenge I need to do or I’m just in the zone.
---
If survivors DC due to rage or bad connection I usually kill one and farm with the other two allowing them to leave. That way everyone gets something out of it and they don’t end up screaming their lungs out in the end game. 
---
I usually get messages thanking me and telling me GG. But other times I do run into a few survivors who don’t like that “I’m not playing the game” but those guys are few and far between.
---
Never stop pigging, I love seeing miss piggy! I think she’s so scary and I’m sad more people don’t play her :(
---
I just messaged a survivor before the game and told them if they let me get 6 grabs I’d let them live, which they did :-)
---
Supercell called. They want their archer back
---
rank reset happens every month, it was basically your rank -8 at high ranks. Next patch it'll be better
---
Also its ranks, not levels. Level is your character, player rank is account side universal. Levels mean nothing except you have gotton the bloodpoints to level them up, which is about 1.3 million per prestige. prestige resets your characters progress to 1 deleting all items perks etc in exchange for a neat clothing. Don't do this
---
Yea, but for most of us, the only witness is our dog, not million of future toxic neas.
---
Its ok u still better than that lefion
---
Ah gotcha, nice play then 👍
---
No, even safe loops become unsafe with the snares, Fred can brute for any loop thats not considered a god loop. Dropping the pallet early just ensures you’re not going just bail off the loop.
---
*stomp* *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* *stomp*
---
Oh trust me, i know. I practically made the rule book
---
I can’t freaking stand people who hate message killers after “beating” them 
---
What’s even the point?! say gg or nothing and move on
---
Don’t forget the person on the other side of the screen 😤
---
It is! I only do it to toxic survivors, I don’t have an issue with facecamping or tunneling because if a killer does that they pretty much lose the game in higher ranks
---
Oh rlly me too
---
I always hope to scare people! Fear makes the game fun! It's definitely been harder since her traps don't work for endgame anymore, but I don't wanna play anybody else
---
If u do gens as survs ur toxic and if you attack survs as the killer ur toxic. To prevent toxicity everyone needs to quietly sit in a corner
---
What!??! S I tHoUghT thE HunTrESs wAS onE
---
Don’t you make fun of the god of gaming. Did you not read his book?
---
you could try running whispers to let you know when someone is close by
---
Imagine jumping off dead by daylight only to realise the spirit can torment you irl too
---
Well yea it would switch at every gen, or else that just wouldnt be fair lol if it was the same obsession. That would be hella viable and OP
---
I found the delusional survivor main
---
I dont talk shit but i will definitely curse out a killer while I'm playing (to myself) usually to just calm down and admit I fucked up.
---
Stunning the killer isn't toxic it's just a stategy to make distance, you should change that to flashlight clicking. 
---
Otherwise I love the meme
---
It’ll be the collab of the century.
---
Sends a salt message over dumb shit, then calls the killer toxic smh. Some people man lol
---
Quentin looks like if feng min was transgender
---
Do what works it's up to the devs to fix it.
---
Yeah but then you'll get 20 Survivor Mains telling you what an idiot you are for running it and that all you have to do is find a teammate to heal you.
---
😂 I still can't believe it
---
How do you think it feels playing killer and having like 5 useful perks to choose from .\_.
---
BHVR needs to take a look at perks in general but they won't. They're too complacent with the game and balance patches don't directly equate to money unlike releasing busted dlc every 2 months.
---
Hm, I wouldn't really call them beginner-friendly, because I suspect you won't understand what they're saying, ha.
---
Either way, https://www.twitch.tv/goku2093, https://www.twitch.tv/sal_gu, and https://www.twitch.tv/rnlghs128 are good players that are also fairly entertaining (well, not goku, it's incredible how boring he is, but he's still a competent player).
---
The random part is what would make it unviable. The odds of it being a Survivor no where near you is high enough to not be worth the perk slot for me.
---
No. Don’t see a reason for it.
---
High five
---
Same, and if they did he would become shit again. But just want to know opinions.
---
I hope I get some salt today. It’s been too long. The best is when they send the voice messages
---
What if it guaranteed an obsession who was working on the gen, would that be better?
---
Tempted to get plague, got the money, perks look fun, and gameplay is unique enough, but somethings stopping me.
---
Ironically, it fits with the image.
---
If you have Myers, just run a scratched mirror on Hawkins
---
Man, haven't played injustice 2 in a LOONNNGGG time....I was awful at it lol
---
This is the only way to win on the hospital/ward map. You need to take that middle room gen out asap.
---
just minimize chat and pretend no one talks to you

This was five games in a row yesterday I had as killer. Guess I need to start slugging the 3rd.

Probably botted account

All of these are crazy over powered except for wanted and powerful strike on the killer side

---
There's still an element of which one it goes to if more than one did it, but probably. Still a matter of how close you are to that gen at least. I would say the best way to use the perk at that point is to run it with Bitter Murmur and hope for the best if it was more than one.
---
Any killer ability that doesn’t have a gameplay relationship with the survivors could be considered busted. Oni isn’t any different
---
That’s no lag switcher, just a survivor with an expensive gaming chair
---
Meh sometimes i just can't hit skill checks. Other times i don't miss a single one.
---
Happens to the big streamers too.
---
More often than not i go hunt the totem though, because even if i can hit the checks, 3 other people usually can't.
---
Bruh what rank is he
---
I like playing in groups as survivor but sometimes the people I play with complain too much about what the killer "needs" to let them do like saving someone right in front of them or letting them live. It gets pretty damn annoying. Killers play how they want to and you as a survivor adapt. That's how I see it anyway.
---
funny haha xdxd
---
Nea is more cute than Feng and Kate combined
---
fite me
---
what's written there?
---
Trap gens with Rusty Shackles = easy grab or two before survivors realise what's going on. But they're not running Shackles so idk!
---
haha funny haha xddd
---
That’s casual freddy BP numbers lol, that was me dicking around rank 12 at 2:00Am when I hadn’t played killer in about a month and my second match of freddy ever
---
Pretend they are bots. That's it
---
Just play how you would against an AI in any other game
---
Last night I was playing against a trapper and one of us was on the hook and while I was going for the rescue all of us not on a hook stepped in a trap at the same time across the span of all of 3 seconds leading to a 4k in under 5 minutes. I wasn't even mad just because it was so over the top funny

I reckon an injured bill is louder but okay

Meg with flashlight: Heh heh, boi

"And here, you have the Nea, they say it's toxin targets the brain with the victims suffering from symptoms of extreme anger, hatred, and sadness, they also suffer from hearing voices, in particular, saying"gg EZ", or "GG baby killer", before the toxin finally kills them".

Wait... you ALWAYS farm? You never play for real?

Hate people like that, can talk the talk but not even begin to walk...
---
Well, good luck waiting.
---
Still it's about legion and spirit. I don't have freddy so I wouldn't know average bp for him "dicking" around. Also two matches as freddy for your first time playing him with such high bp must've been nice but every match won't be that way so brave yourself bud.

Hey folks, just letting you know that window vaults, pallets vaultd and locker grabs also count. So if you see a injured survivor vaulting and you're close don't lunge just grab em
---
Clever
---
I don't know, that cosmetic lost its street cred when the Urban Evasion Neas started rocking it while immersing across the map as if they were nothing more than a brown shirt Claudette.
---
If you need to make a reddit post over a single match you should be in therapy instead of DBD.
---
Still surprised iridescent head hasn’t been removed. i haven’t had one game where a survivor doesn’t instantly disconnect using it.
---
Yeah they’re useless after they nerfed instablinds over a year ago.
---
Wait until they release shirtless Myers.
---
Not even slightly, the fuck?
---
No, he is very weak.
---
The insistence here that he's good is baffling. He absolutely is not at all.
---
Hey what book is this and where can I get it
---
Its super easy, you can just grab them out of a window vault or pallet
---
This is the best thing that has happened to Dead by Daylight in the longest time. I've not laughed hard at all then as much as I laughed at this piece. Congrats on the killer being a good sport with the Disconnects. I know that some killers out there get extremely sweaty even after two disconnects.
---
There are still quite a few people playing the game, and with taking awhile for killer I myself wait quite a bit for a match myself.
---
Correction it's my explosive diarrhea when I see Oni charging at me from across the map
---
How is he not?
---
He's one of the weakest in the game, easily. He is Doc tier at best
---
It’s normal at this point. Just grab your phone or a book and wait out the time
---
Yes. He will be and no it won't be because of the statistics. And he won't become shit again. They will just tune things  down to work a bit more in line with the game mechanics. Few example just imagine hag casting her traps while moving, giving no indications, sounds. Or Spirit/Nurse using her movement power while she runs after u at full speed. Or doctor having his fake pallets that you cannot tell if they are real or not unless you use it. Nothing to do with statistics. They just show what every decent player could tell easly is broken currently
---
I do believe the devs might nerf some of his slow-down add-ons or atleast change them to something else considering people are beginning to complain about Forever Freddy builds. 
---
For Freddys base power I doubt they will nerf him since no one really complains about his power being OP.
---
Even more reason to avoid spoilers. Lots of young ones haven't seen it yet.
---
there's at least 4x as many survivors as killers, so of course there's going to be more douchey survivors statistically.
---
A fellow Ardetha fan. I like your style. I got to Rank 1 on both sides listening and watching him. Not being a douche bragging, just saying that's how informative I found him
---
Sorry there not meant to be in the game just some stuff
---
Well hes not completely unusable like legion is. His perks need a huge change imo and a tweaks on his abilities.
---
Yeah, and we don't like people who need to rely on closets
---
it worked first try!
---
Sorry btw for shitty quality, I had to screen record from Xbox app cause I’m out of space and I wanted to post this instantly cause I’m so frustrated.

*Cries in Demogorgon's loud ass footsteps*
---
Killer times for me? Atrocious.
---
Survivor times? Instant.
---
It's just a little graphic issue it might be with your PS4?? I've never had this issue.
---
Yeah any grab saves your item as Franklin drops them only on hit
---
I’d rather just end it quickly and get into a new game. I’ll usually hook them quick or give the last guy hatch if it’s close, but I don’t want to sit around cause their teammates were salty and/or morons. I just want to play the game.
---
Grabbing them out of a locker doesn't count. They have to either be in the animation for entering or leaving the locker for it to count.
---
COW TREE
---
yep i put my christmas sweaters on all my mains! 😊 jake’s is underrated i never see it. him getting attacked by bears is pretty funny for an xmas sweater
---
The easiest way to do this challenge is to chase someone around a loop until your right behind them. Eventually they'll get bored and vault the pallet and you can grab them. Or you can motion for them to do it and sometimes that works.
---
Is that snake real it looks just too beautiful to be real
---
when you buttdance to meme and the killer thinks your being toxic so they camp you I cri evry tim
---
Chainsaw time
---
You.....you just argued against yourself my dude.
---
When u dont have myers so u have to improvise
---
I had a survivor tell me he hopes he gets to meet my mother so he can fuck her and that I’m literal shit trash because I 4K’d with Trapper this morning. The salt mines flow without question on Xbox.
---
Legion can be better and often is. You cannot create a viable build around Demo like you can with Legion
---
shoulda tried to leave when u had the chance my guy
---
Categorized as “suggestion” lmao
---
Maybe it depends on where you live and when you play?
---
I'm in the central US and a rank 2 survivor/rank 14 killer - never spend more than five minutes waiting for a lobby for either role
---
Why didn’t you just go in the hatch? You waited forever. Would it not let you?
---
I get camped because I run Small Game and clear their hex totems in the first 30 seconds every game.
---
No. I just pointed out his perks are pretty trashy. Im being realistic. His semi-good. Hes problems are which i said, portal, perks. His shred is pretty fine as it is in my opinion.
---
Surprisingly I haven't seen any bad lag thus far over the past week, but there have been the questionable hits here and there. Hell, one game I even had a trigger-happy plague who kept lunging up RIGHT BEHIND me but I wasn't getting hit (maybe I was the one lagging for her).
---
Not as weird as that but I got called a trash can once. I was just kind of confused.
---
Adrenaline when it's happening
---
Shred is practically useless.
---
You may throw a hatchet you know won't hit 99% of the time to force the survivor to not go a certain way.   For example, aiming at the window in the storehouse.    You throw it, they have to dodge, not taking the loop, and you can close the distance to M1.
---
So 2/3 of him are trash, but he's semi good?
---
Mmm... not entirely. Not close enough to a lunge, it does give a slight edge. Also pallet break during chases and it sometimes makes survivors panic and drop pallets.
---
I usually tell people that I'll wiggle if i need saving. If someone is on the way, or I'm getting camped, i just sit still.
---
Much appreciated sir! True on the language barrier but just seeing the loops and the play style will help tremendously, Thanks again.
---
Legion can be bought with Shards because he's an original killer, not licensed. Not sure if you know this, cause you could have potentially bought a different killer that costs real money. Or you just wanted Legion, which is cool. Just making sure you know! =)
---
Nope, just high latency. Maybe just leave the second you're able to instead of dicking around and being a brick.
---
Idk I’ve just been seeing streamers and stuff who have player level 6 and some characters on like prestige 2 level 30 or something advanced
---
Nope, he's fairly balanced now.
---
Killer shack probably
---
Demo is definitely not as good as some killers, but he is not low tier at all. He requires actual patience to play. When using shred anyone near your portals are revealed making for very good tracking on gens. I got a 4K because they could not touch any gens as anytime the touched the area I knew. Demo is not as bad as these people say. His play style is not for people who like playing hillbilly, and destroy the team in 3 minutes.
---
He could be better no doubt. Only reason im not saying hes trash cause legion got butchered and thrown to that spot. But if you really want me to define him better, Semi-Ok.
---
Damn insidious wraith’s. man there’re everywhere nowadays
---
„I am scared“
---
You could just run crackhead perks if your getting ruin all the time like I run Resilience, This is not happening, Spine chill and no mither or switch spine chill iron will if you want to be sneaky or put in an exhaustion perk. Ruin skill checks are a breeze if you are at least semi competent with my crackhead build which as a crackhead you have to be.
---
First, Doc is at the top level of mid tier. Second, he can literally compete with Billy. Why do I feel like you think that Spirit is better than Nurse XD
---
jeff would have something to say about that but he's busy wheezing
---
HAH. If the next update fucks up legion so nemesis is a must, yeah. Good luck with it. Demogorgon isnt that bad.
---
If memory serves me correct this was brought up on the stream they did when the archives were released and their answer was that the challenges would likely be centered around their perks and that they’d offer them on the shrine at that time to allow everyone the chance to complete the archives. Obviously don’t quote me on that and if they did say that you know things can always change.
---
the pallet break is just fun. it doesn't add to his strength at all
---
&gt; and it sometimes makes survivors panic and drop pallets.
---
bad survivors who drop pallets early anyway 
---
&gt; it does give a slight edge
---
literally the only circumstance it gives an edge at all is at certain windows like shack or the torment creek window. that's it
---
I’m torn between both sides tbh..but i honestly think that grabs on hooks shouldn’t be a thing when it’s two left. That’s too damn cheap to me and it really just promotes the idea of camping. “Why look for the other one? He’s just gonna come back over here and unhook.” Camping! I don’t care what you call it’s camping!  Too many Survivor aura reading perks for you to be worried about a hooked survivor.. that’s how some killers lose hatch lmao
---
How many times we gonna see the same meme over and over

Anyone can throw 1k, getting 1k hits is another thing...

Hey everyone I forgot to mention this, forgive me lol I’m running on like 16 hours no sleep. He face camped three rank 17’s, idk how I matched with them or what but I’m a rank 9 myself. I normally never bm or flashlight click but I felt bad for the babies, the only time I don’t run borrowed.  I think he was a rank 16 himself but I’m not sure, I don’t quite remember.  It’s been a bad night on dbd, I obviously shouldn’t have waited and that’s totally on me.

---
&gt; Demogorgon isnt that bad.
---
you have completely failed to prove this and in fact proved my argument correct. it is literally insane you think otherwise
---
No reason to not slug for a 4k? The fact you have to do that is annoying
---
BL creates infinite loops where no other perk does. That's not balanced in the slightest.
---
Then it is a chain reaction as one DC's after the other
---
How do you do that anyway? I've never been able to, just hit them
---
Hex: Do Nothing Helpful
---
Doing gens? Toxic. Hooking survs? Toxic. Enjoying the game? *Uber Toxic*
---
I get what you're saying.  But I've already made my case.  It's true that if you're good at looping against the plague then being sick is a better alternative to giving her the corrupt purge.  However, most survivors are not that great at looping (which is why they're not rank 1)  And by healing up, they need to get hit twice and can more easily save against her when she camps.
---
To each their own.
---
Is it the real center of your screen? I just started playing Huntress and I can tell my aim is off because where I think is the center actually isn't
---
I bought The Legion two nights ago and I've been having so much fun playing as them! I was stuck on rank 16 the last week, and after playing as them for two days I've reached rank 12! They definitely have their weaknesses, but I think they're a good killer for putting pressure on survivors. 
---
The biggest thing that helps me with them is to always keep moving, and conserve your rage until you've closed the distance a little more!
---
No offense, but no one is going to take your opinion or anything you say even remotely serious if you unironically say something like "killer mains cry massive salt" in what you're saying.
---
Sometimes it's impossible to get him out, sometimes he just gets popped out immediately, and at red ranks people generally use him for his stealth and mindgames and not for his stalk to begin with. Either way I think both sides would prefer it be more consistent. In my experience people have 0 problem getting me out of it, even with my back turned to them. So it would be more of an issue if he's crouch leaning, in which case, do as you do with Michael...break LoS. 
---
I dunno why so many people make such angry posts and talk in made up arguments with themselves. If you're having problems overall against GF, you have other problems.
---
I know but im suppose to have it. I buy it in the shrine of secret
---
No, Huntress just enough!

Relatable

Shoutout to the dudes in SWF that helped me complete the endgame sacrifice chalange yesterday

---
Learn and Master loops
---
Add me: GlizzyGangIshy
---
Reminds me of Hotline Miami!
---
And survivors cry massive salt when they can't snap him out. So who's right?
---
This happens way too much.... like I legit see them and they expect me to leave? How about be a better survivor and don’t be seen in the first place?
---
And not one gen got done 😂. Good hustle team.
---
Same lmao it’s infuriating
---
Personally, I just attempt to play as fairly as possible. I find that probably 98% of the time, if the survivors are being pissy for whatever reason after the game ends, complimenting their loops, the plays they tried or saying* the chase was fun typically gets them to back off and we all get to go on our merry way to the next one. If they keep crying, it's all good, just click continue and move on, lol.
---
*word
---
In theory I agree, but in practice I do not, for a couple of reasons:
---
= It takes time for a team to determine a killer is camping in solo. Some killers will camp for a bit and then leave, and just because they camp once doesn't mean they will camp the next time.  I usually give it 1-2 passes before I write the killer off as a camper, depending on how apparent it is.  That's me though, there are others and if even one of them doesn't pick up on it and gets hooked - the just do gens strategy becomes difficult. 
---
\-It's not very fun.  Just doing gens because the killer wants to afk at the hook is neither side engaging with a big portion of the game.   Some players would rather attempt to rescue a camped survivor than sit around for 5 minutes running ruined gens, even if they pick up on the killer's intention quickly.
---
Speak for yourself
---
I looked at this and thought “all that and not one gen done” lol
---
Dbd itself wont ban you, but the EAC might auto ban which is what the devs have warned. It's a "use at your own risk" choice
---
I don't play survivor that often but I got the reverse of this yesterday where a killer called me a bad teammate for leaving the only other alive teammate after he had NOED and hooked them. I'm not dumb.
---
They won't ban you 100%. BHVR has directly stated nobody will be banned for it on their side and EAC only gives a shit if important files are tampered with and it doesn't consider the icons to be important files so you're good.
---
🎉🎉*IN BEFORE THE TOME CHANGES*🎉🎉
---
When I'm carrying a survivor to a hook I try to do a couple of quick scans around the area. Usually I see someone hiding behind a rock, tree, or sometimes directly behind me.
---
It's not hook camping if your standing in my line of sight while hooking, and then immediately rushing the hook as soon as I walk a few steps away.
---
Flashlights are literally the only item that has counterplay. I'd rather see 4 flashlights than 4 toolboxes every game :(
---
I've already fapped today.
---
As survior main can confirm(atleast they are efficient and not useless like reds in my region. Some guy advised me to region hop via swf. Its worked. They still kinda toxic a-holes tho)
---
Cereal when have milks
---
share your opinions, ideas and what else should be added on :)
---
Hes broken though. Literally broken. You can walk behind survivors as GF, stare to expose them and they cant break you out.
---
Its not about a nerf its about actually fixing him, but him being busted is part of what makes him strong so killer mains wont allow it.
---
I looked at this post and then got a “trending notification” when I closed the app.
---
*He knows*
---
Epic, here's your Reddit gold
---
So it only counts as countering if you pip?
---
There are different sources of what to do but I Believe hook dancing should be reserved for the camping or nearby floating killer in games.
---
 This is mostly because if the killer sees you doing this signal, Hook dancing, it applies Pressure to them that (good) survivors know they're near and are focusing on gens instead of possibly all going for the save. If you dance to signal come get you and the killer sees it, its more likely they would come back to the hook since the come get me signal is visible.
---
I try to enforce this in game and post lobby when it happens but its still not universally signaled.
---
Lol dude I said the same thing
---
Heeey I remember this guy. 
---
Good dude. 
---
Didn't think I'd see him pop up on Reddit.
---

Yes when I play on my ps4 I feel like I always have to charge it but when I'm on Xbox I have to change the battery less often but bc I'm lazy I play arround one mouth with a cable until I remember that I have to charge my battery XD anyway my favorite one is the Xbox one but the ps4 one is good also
---
That grab challenge is a bitch you’re a hero
---
Every weekend or every other weekend. Maybe even just the first or last weekend of the month
---
Yes but there is no survivor called Wynona.
---
If I'm not mistaken the effect is only In the dream world, which is easy to get out of.
---
You don't need all killers, neither you need these cosmetic packs.
---
So all others are fair game? K.
---
If you see a survivor healing another survivor, you must turn around and count to 10 before chasing them. Also don't use any perks or add-ons. If they completed the last gen, then you must quickly run to the basement and let them leave peacefully. 
---
*"GG EZ baby killer LMFAO"*
---
It's adorable especially the drawing of her "DX"ing on the tree
---
Maybe I’m a bit off but it’s to a point where I am clearly looking at him :/
---
&gt;honest question his kit is already overbloated by and on top of that he can tunnel anyone and still come on top, BT is worthless against a Freddy.
---
BT is worthless against: 
---
* Freddy.
---
* Crouched Pig.
---
* Cloaked Wraith.
---
* "Shrouded" Ghost Face. 
---
* EW1 Myers (which is one of the available builds alongside scratched mirror add-on). 
---
* Any killer with Insidious. 
---
This is a problem with BT being Terror Radius based, not necessarily with Freddy. 
---
Freddy needs oblivious to counter Object of Obsession.
---
Devs need to fix BT (once again).
---
Okay heres an ok build. Pop goes, discordance/survailance (preferable survailance), BBQ, and STBFL (tbh this is a free slot, its whatever you want it to be. Same with bbq) also never activate your portals. Just place them and activate them when you get a hook. This stops survivors from destroying them instantly and makes them think "oh he doesnt wanna teleport" which is a lie. As for addons, anything goes fr. You can pick anything you want fr fr but you can also go full on yolo mode and go with no add ons. Since hes not the best killer since hes portals are pretty ass, i'd suggest getting atleast a few add-ons. Any map works with him. (A total lie cause some maps are ass for killers.) But most maps are ok. Indoor maps like the game work okay cause survivors cant really see where the portals are (due to walls) and you might get away by activating a few. Hes not that good, but as it is with legion, you can make it work.
---
You earned a follow on Instagram from me. Really good work
---
Laughs in spirit
---
left behind when mom throws you out ofnthe house
---
It’s projection. Try the hardest to hate the people you know you are.
---
not if you get hit you are put against again in dream world and freddy just needs to stay with you until you collapse from mending
---
Would you rather sit in a que for 30 minutes to find the “perfect” survivor-killer match-up or have some flexibility in the matchmaking system so you can actually play the game?
---
What version of this song did you use?
---
Wow lol I can’t imagine it being worse than it is that’s insane
---
Yea your not wrong but I really don’t know what killers to buy and I’d want the best experience
---
My issue with freddy is that its a power creeped killer, having much better stuff than plenty of older killers he has no downside and having obvlivious is the icing on the cake because he can tunnel anyone without losing anything.
---
For those you mentioned excpet Ew1 Myers you can wait for them to attack you and rescue for freddy you cannot.
---
Doesn’t matter how much or how little was said, there’s still bitching about the opponent as if their opinion on how the opponent should play matters.
---
What about, the every generator in X meter from downed obssesion gets blocked by entity 25/30/35 sec?
---
Np
---
Cleansing all totems is a hell of a lot longer than pressing 1 button to close the hatch and no one is saying it requires any skill I don't know where that keeps coming from..
---
Old Freddy back? Yay?
---
Whenever I play him, to me it feels like I'm losing the match 90% of the time then all of a sudden I get 1-2 clutch traps and all of a sudden I have a 4k.
---
He does have probably one of the best snowball potentials of most killers, the issue is starting the snowball most of the time for him.
---
Nah at the core those dudes are fake red rank survivors. Their skill is shit compared to a real red rank because these are the people who play in SWF every match. They might be a red rank but they don't deserve it
---
Sometimes healing can get glitched and the input doesn’t pop up. Happens  to me a lot on console

Dedicated servers are a thing now so if your connection sucks then its on your end.
---
Lol he mad
---
Huntress main here.
---
Can 100% confirm.
---
I'm in eastern, but I don't think it matters with how matchmaking works
---
same thing happend to me i couldnt do shit
---
So if your hardware/location is limiting your gaming experience you shouldn't play at all? You can see your ping to the server. Just don't push ready if it's red. Problem solved
---
Just check killers out on the test server once you get the game, idk if it's online 24/7 but I believe they all are unlocked there so you can try them at least.
---
I only bought pig and legion dlc, got spirit with free shards and I don't feel the need to get more. Have all meta perks from the shrine, there's always 4 perks on rotation for Iri shards each week so that's not a problem either if you're willing to wait to get them 4 free.
---
Cosmetic packs from store are not worth it imo, there's a bunch of stuff that's far better in in-game store; either real money or iri shards that you'll farm by playing.

---
Add me: Lobster_Rob I'm killer main because I have no one to play with, but I occasionally play survivor just for dailies or just for fun when I'm tired being bullied by survivors. But a warning I sucks sometimes.
---
WAIT THERE ARE GUNS IN THE ENTITY’S REALM?!
---
I felt this post on a whole different level
---
I hate it when someone has the killer running round the hook while you're on it instead of taking them away -.-
---
You’re right, there isn’t
---
Wow I didn't know that, thanks for telling me
---
So u are able to grind for the killers?
---
Holyshit some Killers don't know when to give up.
---
What do you expect when people play SWF? People are not going to just not play with their friends because they're lower rank
---
Seems rather low on both points,  though I guess the time limit is at least better than Thrilling Tremors. Would be a nice combo with Surge.
---
I learned real quickly ruin was a bad idea. Forgot I was playing new players and brought it on Hag.
---
Lmao why does it have to be 30 minutes... You're exaggerating a lot. And if you exaggerate a lot neither option seems good. I can usually find a match in about 2-5 minutes, however sometimes the matchmaking doesn't make sense. Maybe make it a little bit longer but more accurate....
---
welcome to Dead by Daylight. I’ve gotten to a point where the game is so bugged I was stuck at rank 8 4 pips after rank reset, after I reported it the devs brilliantly fixed that bug by changing my rank to 13 1 pip and I still can’t rank up since it simply brings me back at the rank I was when I opened the game each time I close it. I’ve gotten to a point where the only reason I play the game is just to head on noobs, since the game is too broken to work correctly.
---
Some survivors are so entitled. “You need to walk away after you hook someone *immediately* or its camping.” Oh, really? Why don’t you go stand in the middle of a field for me, it’d make my job as the killer easier.
---
At this point he's one of those streamers who's famous for raging so this is probably the perfect game for him.
---
What about the other way around?
---
Like every gen outside of Z/Y/X (where X is the lowest number) meter radius get blocked by entity for 25/30/35 sec?
---
Even if BT did work on you if freddy hits you your mend timer goes down while he's chasing you. That's the worst part. The rest is fine since you can wake up and use BT if you want to but not well
---
I got that achievement as well
---
Are you solo or SWFing with them? If you are solo Tapp could easily be SWF with the other two or one of them.
---
I believe all of the non-licensed killers can be bought with iridescent shards. I've been saving up and I'm planning to buy the Oni with mine.
---
Non-licensed yes, if it's say: Ghostface or Demogorgon you have to buy these with real money.
---
Oh cool I just need to get the money for steam 😅
---
Better against the gen rush, otherwise an odd choice.
---
It's also on Iphone for mobile now and that's free

For real, if they would’ve broken the pallet earlier it would’ve cut that chase down by a good amount.

What rank are you? As soon as you hit rank 14 and higher you'll see the queue drop down to minutes if not seconds sometimes.

Um thanks I guess but that wasn’t exactly what I was asking. I know there is a rank reset however some people are only on player level 6 but are very advanced in terms of character level

*sees dweard's bald head*

"MY EYES!!!"
---
the only thing worse than plagiarizing another person's work is plagiarizing your own work. disgusting
---
Or if you want to literally teleport to gens just play Freddy. I don't know why they made a killer that came out after him have a worse teleport ability. He was the first DLC I bought and the whole mechanism just feels clunky and boring to me. Then I started playing Freddy and was honestly baffled why it wasn't made more like his.
---
Yeah I watch him all the time, he's my favourite streamer
---
No, it's still safe with borrowed time as long as they don't get downed
---
I love twerking Jane! Did he end up killing you guys?

Survivors already have it too easy imo.

My hype for Oni is off the fucking charts
---
I'm sorry but r/dbdgonewild
---
My face when the killers offering dont flip
---
Dosnt work would be a counter. You present a narrow minded view on that. Bt is not just an anti camping tool. It allows risky hooks and ensures you get safe hooks. Tunneling is countered by getting out of those ranks. Making bt not terror radius based just makes the perk increasingly stronger and walking towards nerf terf.  I dont enjoy tunneling shitheads but they are only fucking themselves over.
---
Last week-ish, I was playing Wraith, around 1 or 2 in the morning, and got this group of three yellow ranks and one purple. Unsupprisingly I literally ran them over. The poor Purple brought a map, and was playing very well, so I rang my bell and chased her around with out downing her until we found the hatch and I let her out. Super friendly.
---
I load into the next lobby and there she is, same map. So the game starts and it is immediately noticeable that these players much better than the ones in the last game. Game was super close One generator left, I see the hatch sac the second person and I am running to where I know someone is and I see the Claudette, I ignore her keep going for the other person. Hook, Sac, and then run back to the hatch. I stand on it, and just ringing my bell. I see her over by a tree and I swing at the hatch and take a few steps back and swing at a pallet and let her run up and escape. She didnt recognize me until she ran up into the hatch.
---
I have never run into the same player twice like that, and I would have felt bad smashing the hatch in her face when she was so nice last game.
---
How about looking into the sky and not to the flashlight?
---
Or is there a bug I missed?
---
If you mean the gold/green/purple/red number above your survivor, 20 is the lowest rank and newer players, rank 1 is the best of the best
---
Please execute me
---
The blindness lasted permanently through the entire game.
---
Sorry but on game pass ultimate. Like my daughter wants to play on her account.
---
My friends and I will just play together in the same room from now on so we aren’t cheating. That make you feel better?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e4nwn0/bug_or_just_some_bullshit/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I crouch down when I am injured and caught in a dead zone with no chance of making distance.
---
They got me, I could waste like half a second of their time or just bend the knee, and accept it. Sometimes, the killer will just leave you be.
---
This is one of the most neckbeard comments I've read on this sub haha. "Ackshyually we're a competitive team you filthy casual" lol. I really have nothing to contribute to this conversation just wanted to point that out.
---
none of your posts are funny and you insult the people saying your posts are not funny. sad 50yr old baldhead
---
That's too far. I run pop for the gens with progress near the hook. Theres no point I  staying. Even if you go back to the hook after someone e gets unhooked, what progress will they really get honestly not much.
---
Poor baby... waiting for that face rework... if it ever comes...
---
you can't see others player levels though? Unless your talking about videos and stuff, once you hit 100 it resets to 1.
---
So, the exact same thing people with thousands of hours in the game do on a daily basis. Also the exact same thing a lot of the top streamers/content creators do. Sure, contributing to it is still bad, but maybe we should attack the issue at its roots.
---
Hol’ up x3

If only it was an easy fix.
---
I mean like, they are bs on both sides both ways
---
and apparently Burger King Employee has Ghost Face stalk progress on him.
---
there's a lot to take in here.

Because 20 is higher than 1
---
*equips ebony mori just incase*
---
This has literally happened to me
---
In my almost 150 hours of Killer I have only had one hit in my eyes that should not have happened (mainly because the game runs so that if its a hit on the killers screen its a hit, period).
---
I was playing new nurse on Mothers Den. Ash ran up the hill thats L shapped and has a Wall on one end a cliff next to it and gens can spawn on it (There is probably a community name for the tile I don't know), and hes up on top, waiting for me to blind, so I go up the hill and he falls off the cliff and I blink and swing to catch him, miss the blink and hes now with in a foot behind me but still commit to the lunge forward, away from him, and it still hits and downed. I went to pick him up to drop him because I was not ok with that hit.
---
He then quickly DC'd before I even picked him up.
---
Another player said they watched it happen and said to looked strange. I will never know how or why that worked.
---
Maybe don't run Pop on Freddy.
---
Maybe don't run Enduring/Spirit Fury on any M1 killer.
---
Maybe don't run Monitor &amp; Abuse on Myers.
---
Maybe don't run BBQ at all.
---
Sometimes, if I'm feeling charitable,  I like to play the "let survivors have fun" game. Like when the game is borderline over with 2 people on the hook, two injured, one in chase, and 5 gens left. I will occasionally get a drink/snack and let survivors stabilize a bit to extend the game for a bit more fun and bp.
---
That happened to me yesterday too. A Michael Myers and my first Legion on The Game. It was horrible.
---
She actually has to land hatchets for that to work.
---
If they added a condition that only direct bottle hits could trigger the Exhaustion it would at least have some counterplay but you can just run reload + exhaustion and spam it like a noobtube currently.
---
The time has come and so have I
---
Accurate Cosplay.
---
Looks great!
---
Haha agreed, that’s a big sacrifice lol.
---
Feng is gross
---
I agree that's the superior combo to use. Exhaustion Clown basically says "I'm too bad to remember who has Dead Hard in a match so now none of you get it."
---
You spam pallets like a pepega and hope he's dumb enough to kick them.

Myers about to check your vibe
---
Its literally one of the perks that every single player can get as a teachable because its on Meg.
---
👀
---
You saying that and thinking it's funny proves you're the exact kind of asshole he's talking about. Is he overreacting and could he just close the chat? Yes. His point was when he wins he gets called a toxic try-hard and if he goes easy he gets called trash. I've been subject to both but luckily I play on PS4 where it's a lot harder for assholes like you to message me. So stop being a toxic Survivor and get a life dude.
---
Wtf. That's two different things. If I think someone's near by, I look for 10 seconds and then dip. But if I hate the whole team running around doing strafing runs next to their teammates I'll go for them. If they loop the hook that's their fault. It's not an excuse..
---
Tell me, if I hook someone and someone flashlight clicks me and loops the hook, that's camping? Am I supposed to ditch out when I have my next target literally asking to be chased?
---
You obviously don’t see the other side of things and you’re just completely biased. Communication is not cheating. Is it reportable? No. Does BHVR care if SWFs have communication? Not really. It can be frustrating to go against these people, but just get better at the game. The lack of communication was intended, but do you realize that people like the ability to play and talk to their friend at the same time? You probably don’t because you only see one side and not both. Tunneling isn’t cheating, but it sure is a cheap way to play. You either have never played SWF because you have no friends, or you have no friends because you believe SWF should strictly be played without communication via Discord or other communication alternatives. Either stop playing the game or get over it, BHVR really doesn’t care about communication anymore. As long as people can play with friends and communication with them, people will buy their game.
---
Nothing is funnier than getting a message from a salty survivor. Try to see if you can find the humor in it before giving up, man!
---
Farm?
---
Not really, if you're playing solo Q it's impossible to make fancy coordinated adrenaline plays
---
You have to be within grab range (basically touching) and M1 a survivor during one of those animations. As far as lockers make sure you M1 during entrance/exit animations. If you're super curious about it the best way to test it is doctor. He can grab injured survivors in treatment mode and theres no risk of accidentally lunging.
---
Dedicated servers are literally the worst.  I can't tell you how many times I've been COMPLETELY around a corner and get hit by a hatchet -\_- Also, I just think Huntress hit boxes are broken as hell.
---
Would be a cool offering if you wanted to make sure you could do some basement shenanigans without iron grasp or agitation, but some maps don't have multiple basement spawns.
---
Why do so many of the chicks have dicks?

what l4d2 mod this this?
---
There's this thing called Devotion where once you hit level 100, your player level resets and you get a second number underneath in green. Go back and watch the stream and see if there's a green number. If they're at level 6 with Devotion 1, they're actually level 106, if it's Devotion 2 they're actually at 206 and so on.
---
Also, player levels weren't an original mechanic and came with 2.0, which is why you don't see the level in menu in videos that came out before 2.0.
---
Is there a problem? All of those hit the hitboxes are fine. Those were ALL square in the chest
---
True, even when he would die due tot he endgame timer he would give more points then letting him bleed out.
---
Then they should change the pips not the gameplay getting the hatch being the last which the killer can close anyway is only fair that's why they put it there in the first place
---
Can't wait for the disconnect change to hit people like you x)
---
Honestly it would be fucking amazing to open a locker and suddenly have joey be in spot on the right.
---
When the killer opens that locker, the other member can hand them the survivor.
---
Nea is the real killer
---
Edit: typo
---
No, you also lose Benevolent whenever a Survivor is hooked and get it back when they are rescued.
---
Even without camping this is a busted system, because you lose Benevolence if *you are hooked* and *you have no control over whether other people save you*.
---
It was that dumb fuck, not you.
---
Just making sure she’s phasing
---
i think it's if somebody pallet stuns you, they become the obsession?

If hooking him was impossible, what you did was fine.
---
The things that people asked of spirit changes  were fair. Prayer beads were broken. Spirit still provides 0 feedback for counter play. If you disagree, shows what you really know about ‘bias’. Just to be clear in fact, do you believe there’s anything at all that’s too strong for killer?
---
Well yea but I need to kill the obsession then get another obsession and kill him and etc
---
This is really interesting, but I don’t know if I would want it implemented...
---
Basement can be pretty powerful if a killer can get even just one person hooked down there, idk how it would effect the balance of the game.
---
That's a David.
---

---
I'll never forget what a cool experience it was hearing my noobie friends freak about the foghorn on the swamp map. Seeing them freak over patrolling hooligans woul rock
---
I feel like Legion where he still has the fun parkour shit, but like, has the rest of the gang elsewhere and can switch to that member. The fake Legions can poorly chase people (run at 100%), but can't hit so you are never sure if the legion you are being chased by is the real one or not. 
---
For balance reasons just make it so that you can't become a member who is already in a chase.
---
I've been playing this game for almost two and I half years. I would hope so lol
---
no, i was gonna ask this too!! then i just went with rancor. i hit tier 70 this morning and put the vial item on everyone
---
THATS MY CORNER YOU TOXIC SURVIVOR SHIT
---
I need a macro for that
---
Dead giveaway is P3 claud with flashlights tho
---
I don’t think the ranking system is all that good to begin with tbh. Even a slightly above average solo survivor can make rank 1 if they didn’t care about helping the team and only cared about ranking. Would be nice if they made a casual game mode with no ranking system and reworked how ranking is and make that a more competitive environment. At least then when people are toxic about stuff they’d make more sense. I’ve gotten a 4k before and the survivors acted like they embarrassed me because they teabagged at pallets. Like really??? I was dumbfounded that they complete forgot that in order to gloat you kind of oh idk NEED TO WIN?!?! Lol Some players just need to get their heads out of their ass because their brain is melting due to the fumes of smelling their own farts.
---
Lol you're just saying that cuz you main killer and cant handle a real challenge
---
But the pig somehow even more so
---
As a survivor something that's gonna be crucial is popping, learn that and you'll instantly get better.
---
u do this a lot &lt;3 wow xbox avatars got so much more high poly
---
Honestly just keep playing and learning. If you like watching game play you could look up some DBD youtubers or twitch streamers and pay attention to how they play. Also it wouldn't be a bad idea to play some killer if you haven't tried it out much yet. Being able to get into the mind of a killer will only help you be a better survivor.
---
Carson would be proud
---
Ok entitled killer main,how come you expect people to not talk while playing together?What's difference than solo play if they don't talk are you having a stroke?
---
"Hey lets play together but not talk to each other for some reason"
---
Holy sh*t imagine that THING chasing you down the haddionfield fence area or down the school area That Michael would be terrifying going down hallways
---
I want them to add a side objective where five of the seven generators require a fuse to start. You wouldn't know until you were finished repairing it. Then one would randomly spawn in one of five boxes placed around the map that you could see like the pigs saw boxes. I think only five of seven requiring this would be good as you could get lucky and have up to two generators not require a fuse. Also having it randomly spawn in a box would mean that the killer couldn't just Camp them after a generator is complete. Also neither side would ever know which generator required a fuse so they couldn't Camp one that doesn't.
---
Smh these rank 15 cosplayers man lmao
---
If they don't want to play then dodge a lobby, if you commit to a game see it through, if you disconnect you just show to all that you got no skill, willpower and preseverance and you are actually the guy that fucked over 3 of your teammates... I call that being worse then a killer!
---
\- 3.4.0 is going to be glorious with all the banning that's going to fly around, and obviously no one is going to be the guy that deserved it... This sub is gonna flare up like a dick with an STD and I'm gonna laugh in each and all of your faces when you complain about getting a time out!
---
I would say that 99% of the time is not that hitboxes are broken,but the ping makes it so what you see is not what the killers see,so when it seems that the hit didnt touch you at all maybe the killer saw it as touching you in just the tip,and that is why there are some fake/suspicious hits mostly on window vaults or pallets
---
So why does the killer's enjoyment carry no weight? And a touchdown is a score, same as escaping. Both are "earned" and can be forfeited by toxic behavior.
---
I was drawing a straight line between your assertions that anyone who disagrees with you is engaging in hollow, masturbatory circlejerking. If that's a strawman, it's one that you stuffed and erected.
---
No idea what you're on about with a roller coaster. 
---
Call me what you like. It's people like you that are a big reason I have no intention of joining the community. You pooh-pooh people for not being the "bigger" man because they dared not let toxic teabaggers get their points (their job) and then engage in a bunch of pseudo-philosophical nonsense to deflect after the fact.
---
It's a video game dude. *Everyone* is a keyboard warrior by default.
---
Deadass is it that hard to just have a button that makes the scratch marks blue?
---
But most people DC when being carried to the hook , or after being downed , not because of campers o.o

Deviousness.

In general all Killer powers give Deviousness points for their use; with some (like Legion) getting additional Brutality points if the power lets them hit Survivors.
---
Don’t get me wrong I welcome the idea of  Jason coming to Dbd but let wait after the lawsuit and what if what if that the game company that owned the f13 game finish the Jason x dlc and then after a while Bhvr scoops ups the rights and introduce (I don’t know how lawsuits work so correct me if I’m wrong)

Dis creepy AF.

Ive had so many situations were I see survivors in the distance trying to get me to chase them but I just go back to the hook.....

---
The build is interesting.
---
It would be a good build for small maps like Lerys or the game but larger maps would definitely hurt this build.
---
Surge combo with surveillance is good for giving you gen awareness, especially in small maps. Only issues is that in larger maps you will not get much use of surge. 
---
Surge also conflicts slightly with Pop as you cannot kick a gen effected by surge meaning you would have to find another gen to kick. It can be particularly annoying if you down a survivor next to a near completed gen and you cannot kick it with Pop as Surge has started to regress it.,
---
Pop would synergise well with Surveillance.
---
That's what I just did, except with three survivors, they understood
---
yeah if you get for example the game you would be fucked
---
Legion is my fave killer to play as
---
Technically its still camping. The difference is that its justified and viable.
---
Chapter's come out every four months, there's a schedule for stuff like that if you want to look it up.
---
What purpose would this serve though? If can see they have a toolbox or medkit I don’t need to have it shown above their head especially since it doesn’t show rarity or items on it. It would be noise on the screen that doesn’t really add anything
---
Brown ranks are like this, everyone is so bad
---
It's impossible to play without ruin. You'll be genrushed as a killer. Stop asking us not to run ruin. That thing is a must have once you get to purple or even green ranks.
---
"Let go" -Claudette
---
Surge has no interaction with Pop unfortunately. 
---
Instead, Surge will just cause gens 32 meters away from you to lose 8% progress and begin to regress. It works well with Surveillance but thats about it.
---
fine we’ll just switch to teamspeak then :(
---
Incoming kawaii UI pack 1.0, please and thank you.
---
Welcome at the campfire toxic Meghead, what is it you desire?
---
Some add ons nees rework otherwise he is just a really strong killer
---
you should've put red lines where her limbs are cut, but i love it like that!
---
Really? I could've sworn it did. IIRC I had pop active, and downed a survivor and saw it deactivate. However, even if I'm remembering correctly it could be that the perk deactivates without applying the regression.
---
Grant us eyes, grant us eyeeeeeesssss!
---
I love this idea so much; considering we already have Demo and Freddy who can teleport around the map, this wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibilities. To keep things balanced, the new Legion talking over would need some kind of indicator (idk if it’d be lore-fitting, but maybe the new one would whoop and holler, something along the lines of the horror movies where a victim is being tracked by an enthusiastic killer), which honestly would be fucking awesome to go against.
---
they understood, i apologized even though i didnt need to, i just wanted to get the challenge done and over without have to try hard for a more vanillaish way
---
Madude!!!! Lmao
---
Ha. You get an upvote for actually making me force air from my nostrils.
---
it doesn't matter if you remember or not lol, he is already so bad, let him something at least
---
From what I am aware its more of a controller button issue than anything else. I had the same issue with my PS4 controller while spamming X
---
I switched the Button to Square (In Xbox terms X) and it resolved my issue.
---
If you keep having issues you could try to bind it to one of the trigger buttons.
---
Then why did you not put this nerfs into your idea? 
---
It is like I would say that I suggest removing bloodlust and closing windows, but I will forget to say that there would be only unsafe windows and almost no pallets on the map.
---
No lie, I don't care if i survive or die, but if I die because the game screws me over, I get furious.
---
some characters can hide keys with animations present
---
Lag switch on dedicated servers?
---
No, YOU'RE a clown because sure, Clown can't capitalize on the information. You do realize that there's multiple killers fully capable of getting to where their BBQ targets are before they've left the area, right? Freddy, Billy, Nurse, Spirit and soon Oni for instance. Also, if you don't see any auras on BBQ, well, the survivors just stopped what they were doing to go to lockers or they're near the hook so guess what? You just disrupted the game without having to do a single thing other than hook a survivor.
---
Yikes.
---
So if anyone ever does break the cap again they can just keep going?
---
This is, by far, one of the best ideas I’ve seen come across this sub; the additional ideas sprinkled throughout this thread are fucking gold.
---
That's OK, he'll just lob another one at the safe structure you're going, but yes. Sprint Burst at least gets some benefit before the bottle spam saps you of a perk slot.
---
Yep
---
As you once did for the vacuous Rom
---
I’ll move to PC if that ever happens.
---
Hopefully some killers understand why we DC. Get better internet.
---
All I can hear is the seagulls from finding Nemo "mine mine mine mine!!!"

Also the title makes me think you play orks....filthy green skinz.

They also have to be injured when you try to grab them, otherwise you'll just lunge attack
---
Drop a link to your Twitch!
---
Or tbagging survivors at the exit gate. Or dropping last survivor near hatch and giving them a farewell tbag.
---
Or moonwalk tbagging
---
Or leaning tbag
---
There's a lot of tbag options
---
And I just realised I made an accidental pun
---
he is not mediocre, he is really strong and i would like a rework but its not gonna happen to soon. If he wasn't that strong it will be just fine to play agaist him
---
Calm down please
---
I’m glad, I’ve never played trapper before the challenges and now he’s one of my favorite killers lmao
---
This is why I don't even bother going for any risky pallet drops or vaults anymore.
---
Fantastic editing to the music BTW.
---
I'm pretty bad at the game but when I used to be good I was a P3 level 50 Claudette and I always get camped and tunneled even though I'm rank 16, it's annoying but there's nothing I can do about it, it makes it almost impossible to escape
---
Pharmacy is good for items hunting.  Change my mind
---
I didnt knew,  im gonna search for it,  now i wanna see them xd.
---
I have had recently hooked players body block me to get BT to work as I was chasing another survivor who wasn't even the person who unhooked them. BT should work with proximity to the hook as opposed to killer terror radius.
---
Yes, today i had a meg that let me grab her from opening the exit gates several times
---
I have the same ping on dedicated, but it doesn't matter if the killer plays with 90s dial-up.
---
And they lose some of their charge depending on the level of the perk.
---
not a single gen done in all that time
---
Or to a severed hand ... 
---
Or with one.
---
Sometimes they will spawn to the generator right next to you
---
Everything litty, I love when it's hot 🐍

It’s bc you won’t wear a fuckin shirt David we talked about this

Head?😏
---
I'd swap pop out for ruin or corrupt intervention (whichever floats your boat)
---
And replace whispers with save the best for last.
---
Whispers is nice, but you can cover a lot of it's use with good portal placement, and stbfl is just very good on demo and pig since you can hit your obsession without losing stacks.
---
A C E N D
---
There usually is and I may be wrong but I thought it lasted through NYE the last couple years.
---
Huntress Buff: After achieving bloodlust 1, she may pick up the nearest generator and toss it at a survivor, destroying it and killing the survivor instantly.
---
It’s only 10$ a month on Xbox games pass, I’m no shill but they got some good games if you’re trying to play on a budget and own an Xbox
---
Or hatch!
---
Players: being able again to see the killer's ping would help prevent many hit reg issues.
---
BHVR: we're going to fix the "bug" that allows survivors to see their teammates' ranks.
---
I’d call you a qt for that cosplay, but beads aren’t cute at all lol
---
Make them hate you, we feed on their salty souls. Yes yes do it.... equip NOED on billy make them pay for what they did to us Jason.... Make them all suffer
---
Maybe you should have read a bit further down the thread before jumping the gun, there, friend. If you had, you'd have seen me further clarifying that SWF is fine, it's the people using it in concert with Discord to bypass the lack of comms that is the problem.
---
Well i already found them,  and they look more like a Recolor,  so maybe they will be free or yellow type? (Like cmon its almost Christmas give us more than blues shiny eyes )
---
How is this cursed? Just loud clothing
---
Now if only killers realized that 4k doesn't mean winning either.
---
Is this a joke? Or can someone explain?
---
She wouldn't gender kids
---
It's probably lag or a controller problem
---
I mean
---
Lmao can you imagine being able to regress 33% of all gens in 32m with a basic attack? That would be insanely op.
---
God dude im only on 23
---
Favorite scene of any Souls game.
---
Do you know when he streams?
---
I really do feel the same way, but I must say that since I'm 90% of the time at red ranks since I'm a killer main and I really rarely find a good team, even when they are SWF, most of the times I just chill and if I lose I still drop a gg, so I'm fine the way matches are going
---
I do see the other side, I just happen to disagree with it and think it has no place in this game. Which it doesn't, when you look at how it's designed.

The ugly Sweater cosmetics will just be torsos for legion, You'll still have to equip the mask.

I watched him stream.... he push ruin and hit great skill check better then my team8
---
Yes, I down voted him to -3.
---
So watching Youtubers/ Streamers and playing killer to gain the killer perspective wasn't a good tip to improve? You two are acting like my entire comment was "just play" when it wasn't. They've played for a month so unless they've been playing 25 hours a week they still probably have plenty of game time that they need to put in to have a good understanding of all the maps. I would argue that's the single most important thing someone new to the game needs to learn.
---
No im still going to play but im not buying it

---
Uh, hello? *Ace?*
---
It's fine, I know accepting the truth is difficult, expecially for a toxic and immature community like this one.
---
Im guessing they did dedicated servers wrong then. 
---
In a good server setup, the server is always the absolute state. Sounds like they just did relays to the killer via a server...
---
spotted the salty survivor main
---
Facing the 6th Huntress in a row and starting to cry really hard.

Why would someone get salty over a costume? I’m confuse

Clown of the day guize alright? 😂😂 Oh shit that only works vs toxic survivors here.
---
So I got a 50$ steam card any recommendation on what killers or get lol
---
"why so fucking sweaty killer?"
---
"We only lost because it was Haddonfield"
---
"Imagine using a broken killer, Pig needs to be nerfed soon!"
---
"Why did you fucking tunnel me! I was just going for hatch!"
---
I've seen this exact suggestion 5 times in the past month
---
Just a little PSA: “Do NOT attempt escaping on the hook it just screws over you and your team. Just wait for your rescue.”
---
Awesome! So that means you can try out DBD DLCs for 2 hours and if you don't like it, just return it. They don't come with digital currency so that shouldn't apply to DBD DLCs.
---
His the Most boring killer to play against but fun as hell to play as. Put thanphobia dying light ruin and pop with the slow down addons and you will either have a 5 seconds long game (everyone DC) or a 45 minute long game

I was thinking more along the lines of Pop Goes the Weasel, Iron Grasp, Dark Devotion, and Sloppy Butcher.

... fuck that’s a good point.

Yes, that's what I was thinking as well. The game really wasn't coded for dedicated servers, it looks like they just patched a p2p on the servers.

Stakeout and Prove Thyself are my go-to's when Ruin gets too common.

If you’re getting stunned as the nurse that many times there’s something wrong :)

Only now, seeing them side by side, do I realize how horrifying their original Sonic design was

there’s nothing against DCing but you don’t have the “right” to dc that’s not the correct use of the word

I literally just say“Oop i fucked up” when I get downed

Telling me to read further while you didn't even make it to the third sentence. I'd laugh at the irony, but the severity of your illiteracy is just sad.

You're judging people for wanting to just play with their friends and have a good time. Playing with your friends without talking to them is an outright bizarre thing to do if the option to talk to them during it is there, and it's not nearly as fun for most people. We're social animals, you know?  
---
If your vinegar in this thread isn't fuelled by envy of other people having friends, I would love to know what it is.
---
Agreed, that’s why I play the clown the best killer 👌😍
---
Pffft not even a prestiged meg... What a noob
---
The killer could match with anyone Rank 7-Rank 19 according to the matchmaking system. So it does work properly.
---
Swf in different countries or Just bad internet
---
Probably a bug,  lots of thinks like that happens with pig traps,  what you have to look at its at the timer on the survivors icons, that way you are sure who has it and who doesnt
---
They don’t show rarity so they would have to do some recoloring or make a new icon all together. Also how would they balance them, like how they not be a free find a survivor tool?
---
Yes, it was designed to not have comms, but I believe that it does belong in the game since the game isn’t just about immersion and competition. It can be a casual experience where SWFs just wanna meme around.
---
That's the price we solo queue's pay thanks to the toxic SWF
---
Functions like current prestige method by holding down on the centre after reaching level 50. Once prestige 3, there will be an option for prestige to take you to Gold prestige 1 or otherwise prestige 4 with the reward of legacy pants

Can someone please make a version where it's "red rank killers after losing a match: nice swf"
---
Well yes, if, on a multi gen Surge, applying Pop to all gens would be broken af.
---
If the Pop regression only applied to one of the gens, then I could see it being balanced. This, however, would then beg the question of which gen would get the 25%, whether it's random, closest gen, or most progressed gen.
---
Another possibility is if the 25% was divided, but I could imagine that being unfair.
---
honing stone gamer
---
thank
---
i wouldn't even be mad. you let me farm, you get kills for bloodpoints, win-win
---
What’s stopping me from finding survivors by the icons above their heads?
---
Huntress and Quentin
---
You don't have to be able to talk together to have fun. You can always talk after, and be all like "dude, did you see the bit where I dodged that lunge?!".
---
The game is clearly designed and balanced around the survivors not having comms, and Discord just completely screws that.
---
If you seriously think at this point the game would be more balanced without SWF/voice comms, when as it stands on the whole killers are getting well over the 2k/match average they're shooting for, you're deluded. 
---
Also that's completely irrelevant when you've just been talking out of your ass this entire time, and now are trying to *state what the devs think when you previously were refusing to ask them yourself.* Careful with your back peddling, the basement steps are right there, don't want you to trip and fall further than you have.

[Also here's a shovel for you.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/594984/#Comment_594984) You're free to think that voice chat is cheating, but you're just disagreeing with the developers of the damn game.

Skemoo just rendered them without masks but they’ll still have them in game

This is soooooo good

---
I dont know this was a spoiler post but I think somehow it makes it just that much better
---
Well only two of the 'gen' perks are slowdown perks. Surveillance isn't a slowdown perk, but a tracking perk specifically for survivors on gens, like Thrilling Tremors
---
Freddy and David
---
He's my go to for dbd streams
---
watch the flashlight as im running out.
---
My Favorite killer is The Pig,  it was my first dlc killer,  and always like her playstile and design,  for survivors,  Tapp is the one i use most since i always liked his "Do anything with the killer behind you" Perks and its pretty funny to play like that,  ar least for me.
---
They get punished for dc like ban timer
---
I'm talking about the pregame lobby not in game
---
Portals aren't very fun or smooth to use, he's enormous and very loud/easy to see, and he tell the entire map every single time he does anything.
---
LBR, you just got beat by soloq survivors and automatically assume they're SWF because you just suck.
---
Myers will probably always be my favorite killer to play and to be against. Survivor is Steve
---
I had this happen but opposite. It was me and two others. One was on hook, and I was on a generator with the other. Right before the person on hook entered second state, I sprinted over for the rescue. The killer was camping them(a crouched pig). All three of us managed to escape, but I asked post game why they randomly decided to camp. They didn't camp the first guy, and my hooked friend cant loop for shit, so I was confused. They told me that they had been watching me sit behind the rock waiting for the rescue from the moment they hooked him. Like bitch..
---
It all comes down to personal preference, personally I would, but if you see it as a disadvantage I wouldn’t do it, but go for what you want man! Have a fun time with GF!!
---
The p3 or classic ghostface without the mask is stealthiest
---
I have all of them but the classic ghostface, The knives are all cool
---
buy whatever you want as long as you're having fun with him. Unless you're looking for an advantage then go for the classic
---
He used to be toxic, but isn't anymore
---
Red ranks that have yet to hit 1 are typically farming teamates for pips, or have just played 50 hours a week to grind it out. Its not hard to hit red ranks.
---
And if they have hit rank 1 they just DC if they cant bully.
---
That makes absolutely no sense and has nothing to do with what I said. And you're wrong on both counts, I play 50/50 and have no problem with a challenge. You're just an asshole and obviously felt called out by this post because you know you're the type of person he was talking about.
---
So you're wasting one or two perk slots of chance? 
---
It's a difference in philosophy I guess. I don't like perks that won't bring me value every game. Spine Chill and Bond, they bring a shit ton of value to every game. 
---
DS only give value of tunneled, Adrenaline only gives value if you're in a shit position once you enter endgame, etc etc. I know they have their uses, but they're just too situational for me to waste a perk slot on.
---
And make it so sprintburst doesn't last three seconds of 150% speed because we all saw how the 'sprintburst on demand' worked and that was a very shit time for killers, Sprintburst one demand was a bug
---
Do you know when that goes live?
---
My issue isn't with losing distance on survivors while holding shred, it's with leaping to Narnia because the survivor was using the tactic of spasm around randomly without actively going in any direction.
---
That would literally just be Dead Hard but better. Did you even think this through?
---
Those are called Swfs
---
Myers, Ghostface, Leatherface. (Slasher guy) 
---
I’m sure you can tell what my favorite survivor is...
---
I was just going to ask on the forum last night why it isn't. I would absolutely love for it to be like this one can't really think of any downside.
---
Lol nope you're wrong, I get mad when they stand next to me when I'm on the hook and doesn't move, everything else I'm fine with. Makes the game harder

The clowns ability is to end chases quickly , you can’t bitch about the addons he’s using. Yeah it may not be fun to be against but that’s your opinion some people enjoy the extra knife to their throats against a clown that uses those addon as they just lost a lifeline .
---
I’m completely in love with this 😱

Have you played survivor lately? The game is so killer-sided right now everywhere but red ranks with SWF that all the survivor mains are rage queuing killer. It's why 80% of the games are fast as fuck 4ks even in purple. The only escapes are pity escapes when the killer makes it obvious that the balance right now is a shit show. 
---
Inb4 people just say Im babyraging. Why do you think all the top streamers are killer players right now?
---
You think so? I was actually just wondering why it's not like this myself last night. I mean it wouldn't have the hit protection that DH does.
---
Is that Michael shopped onto Freddy?

You have my arrow sir

I think she looks a ton better with her fortune teller hair do but yes it’s pretty rough. Lol

Honestly, I agree for NEW players. This game is so unintuitive for survivors who have never played this game before. Whereas killer is just your basic chase someone down and kill them like nearly every other game out there. Obviously this is simplifying a bit, but survivor do have a tough learning curve, especially since every killer needs to be counter-played in different ways and there's dozens and dozens of perks, items, and addons to learn.
---
And all of this doesn't change the fact that, yes, survivors are more overpowered at a high skill level, but most players are not rank 1. There's a reason brown/yellow rank killer is so damn easy.
---
&gt; If your vinegar in this thread isn't fuelled by envy of other people having friends, I would love to know what it is.
---
Could be something to do with the integrity and fairness of the game being compromised, that might have something to do with it.
---
You can keep (lamely) insulting me, but doing so won't change my opinion. It also doesn't change SWF being a bad decision, at least in its current implementation. If there was, say, a separate queue for SWF lobbies, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
---
There are plenty of games out there designed around playing with friends, DbD was never one of them. It's been forced in, and it shows. People are not supposed to communicate with each other, it clearly wrecks the balance of the game.
---
Fr cuz people be unhooking especially for quest and I be hooking them in the basement for my quest. Then they unhook literally right when I exit the shack. What ami supposed to do? Pretend like it never happened?
---
Watch tru3ta1ent he plays ghostface alot and he is extremely advanced at dbd
---
was thinking to myself like how would that make things op but I now understand what u thought I meant
---
It looks more like they are doing arm curls to me.
---
Especially Tapp. He leans down pretty low.
---
Fr. You just gotta farm.
---
A cosplay with a lot of effort into the clothing is actually being posted?? Wait that’s illegal.

It's hillarious how people mindlessly ask for dedicated servers no matter the game. A 5 player game is pretty ideal for regional peer to peer. Now we're stuck with this shit because people with no understanding of networks scream for dedicated servers for each and every multiplayer game since the early days of CoD.

Otzdarva has a very helpful video on his YouTube channel that you can checkout if you don’t like want to farm but actually attempt to fulfill the challenge ;)

I’m pretty pissed about that actually.

The survivor lifestyle 😍 “survivors op wah wah”
---
Poor Maurice. He needs pets.
---
Yes that sums it up, I'm a killer main I learned not to get fixated on a injured survivor for too long you have to know when to cut bait and move on to the next, also keep in mind there will be alot of player error who use Sprint burst on demand and used it at the wrong time so it could work both ways
---
Tempting. Come on you're playing with my heart now.
---
Had a toxic game last night. Every hook at least 2 survivors followed me to the hook. During the animation they would hide(not very well) behind something near the hook. I would find them immediately without needing to leave the hook. Got told to kill myself for being a face camper. 
---
I'm not even a killer main, about 60/40 survivor and killer respectively, and even I know this isn't camping if you expose yourself rushing the hook before they even get hooked.
---
Why are you so salty about this? People have different senses of humour. How is that bm btw? Literally just shined his flashlight for a second and it broke.
---
Did I mention I didn't teabag prior to this gift?
---
This man also says he is in red rank, has 400 hrs and once played killer and got to PURPLE rank in one day. That is roughly 22 straight games of merciless, or 7 hours of straight perfect killer games, not including queue time.
---
Well, i Main Pig too,  but i dont know what to tel you, all i have seen were textura Bugs but the timer still going,  maybe its some new  bug that triggers under those conditions idk
---
He also believes lunging attacks should be removed from the game.
---
Lol tf the game should NATURALLY have 6 gens to complete. Don't know where you'd fix the extra gen tho.
---
Everyone's got problems with him, both the people who play him and the people who play against him. A survivor could be using high powered night-thermal vision super-magnification Stalker Stopper™ binoculars while their entire team shines the collective light of the sun on him in the middle of a barren dirt field and there's a 50/50 chance he'll still be able to expose and down someone before getting revealed. On the other hand, the guy playing Ghostface could hear the reveal sting for 1/1,000th of a Yoctosecond and flee across the European and Asian continent to take refuge in the isolated pitch black basement of a kindly Himalayan monk who shrouds him in the magic of invisibility and shoots everyone within a 200 mile radius with a completely silent sniper rifle to keep the secret and there's still a 60/40 chance that he gets revealed.
---
My personal favourite survivor has always been Dwight, he's my main, don't know why but I just leaned towards playing him when I first got the game. For killer, I love playing Spirit, she just feels really fun to play as compared to other killers.
---
Yeah why?
---
No. This makes me want sacrifice myself to the entity.

He linked the top comment, he could have just said "next update", which we are not sure exactly when that will release but hopefully within the next 2 - 3 week's.

pointing and spinning at the exit gate and trying to blind isn’t bm? ok
