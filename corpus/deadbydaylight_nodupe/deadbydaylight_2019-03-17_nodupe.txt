Hex: The third seal, really underrated, no one really tries to actively destroy it too like ruin of devour hope because everyone thinks it's useless. But the knowledge survivors get is comepletely thrown out the window with this perk.

---
---
&gt;NOED has no counters
---

---
I‚Äôm sorry but fucking #WHAT
---
you can literally prevent the perk from being activated before it even activates. 
---
One very important thing for you:
---
Look at Dwights Pointing, Waving and T-Bag Animations. Look at them. Learn them. You want to replicate them as good as you can. I had one Dwight Cosplayer doing them at a Con, it was hilarious af. 
---
ignore the amazing 360 :\^)

Sounds like a plan! üòÇ
---
Oh ya I didn‚Äôt think about that but I don‚Äôt wanna waste a lot of time and fun just for two perks counting Franklin‚Äôs 
---
If they're sitting at gate tbagging, just swat them out. I know you probably avoided going there because you didnt want to give her the satisfaction but going there and smacking her so she is forced to leave or else get hook.
---
It prevents them refusing to leave.
---
I get punished for the rest of those assholes, damn it! 
---
GENERAL REPOSTI
---
Where is Nea?
---
‚ÄúGet good to not be bullied‚Äù is basically putting the blame on the victim who‚Äôs being mistreated by assholes and told to kill themselves while being called racial slurs (also, they‚Äôre still assholes post-game and a game with assholes is fundamentally unfun, whether I‚Äôm winning or not). Just saying. Instead of telling the ones being victimized to get better, maybe tell assholes and bullies to not be assholes and bullies?
---
Those are in-game feature, so no. Just like killers shouldn‚Äôt lobby dodge survivors for using DS, having four toolboxes, etc. 
---
I‚Äôve played high-ranking games as and against solo survs where Ruin was not found ever. You‚Äôre reasoning is not accurate and most people do not have every totem spawn memorized exactly. This is disingenuous. Being able to tell people where the totem is = objectively an advantage. Even if it only speeds up ruin‚Äôs demise by ten seconds, thats STILL an advantage. That‚Äôs not up for debate. Likewise, some powers, like Third Seal, are useless. Who cares if they can see a hooked victim‚Äôs aura if the victim can simply tell their friend ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here!‚Äù
---
It doesn‚Äôt make the game balanced which is why perks are still being changed which I 100% support. It does make the game significantly more balanced given it was objectively designed around zero comms. 
---
I never said SWF should be removed or that comms need to be banned. I am in favor of allowing killers to decide whether or not they‚Äôre willing to deal with SWF that day, and I believe giving them extra bloodpoints for facing SWF would be a good way to incentivize it. SWF can still play with comms, killers have a huge motive to go against SWF, and killers who are having a bad day and just want to relax don‚Äôt deal with comms. 
---
I've been using Windows of opportunity, Dance with me, We're gonna live forever and urban evasion. Is that any good or not?
---
Bravo.
---
Hahahahahha this isn't wise at all. 
---
Spine chill will allow you to deal with stealth based killers. Being able to know if they are targetting you helps greatly with knowing when to start running or hiding. 
---
Urban evasion is great if you want to play immersed and avoid the killer. Combo with Spine chill and you can allow youself to be prepared for each killer. 
---
Sprint burst is great to create distance between you and a killer. Real nice perk.
---
Dead hard is still good. Very good for loops were you are injured. Timing it right allows you to narrowly avoid a hit from the killer and potentially stun them with a pallet. The time they take breaking the pallet allows you to create some distance.
---
Lithe instead of sprint burst is great for creating massive distance between yourself and the killer when being chased. 
---
Some survivors use quick and quiet now to help juke killers. Can throw a killer off if they dont hear you vault a window.
---
The point of playing killer is to get the most amount of kills in the game, if you're telling me that playing the game is being a dick then damn this is the icing on the cake.
---
If u want to say Nea is a boi give up vote xD
---
For anyone else wondering, do not follow this video's steps. It doesn't work.  
---

---
I‚Äôm not calling you a dick directly if you want to slug do it I‚Äôm just saying a lot of people think it‚Äôs a dick move and annoying as hell to play against
---
F my guy
---
I guess it‚Äôs just personal preference. I‚Äôve had better luck with leather. Trapped I usually get stomped.
---
If it works for you then yes it‚Äôs good. If you‚Äôre having trouble with chases though I‚Äôd take out Dance with me for an exhaustion perk, either Sprint burst or Balanced Landing, but any exhaustion perk will do. Otherwise, your build is pretty solid. 
---
I  referred some wedding dress and addedmore details when I drew it :D
---
I hate hatch standoffs too buddy,if the survivor isn't brain dead there's literally nothing you can do as a killer 
---
With your situation I would just let him go as him completing that one gen will reduce your points 
---
I say trapper because he‚Äôs free, good perks, simple and easy to use ability, and he‚Äôs a standard killer. Leatherface is DLC and most people who start playing killer don‚Äôt usually spend money on it. 
---
Looks like she pulled a David on David 
---
What exploit? Moonwalking? If so, then they acknowledged it and said that it was a viable strategy just like gen tapping. 
---
You can literally do nothing all match, be downed just before the last gen gets popped and get away when it does. I don't use NOED, but to say Adrenaline doesn't reward bad play is asinine.
---
I'll try use spine chill more. I didn't know how useful it was. Thanks!
---
This is a skin that is already coming to the game :D
---
Might have been! Are there hills on coal tower? It might have been an auto haven where there is that small little shed that sometimes has a basement in it and sometimes a gen is right outside of it. It was last month sometime.

They did not make it, it is already a skin that is coming to the game. These are just pictures of it rendered.

Heres a video showing the other new skins: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LusX\_1PUm0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LusX_1PUm0)
---
Very true the Canadians forgot how to read a map but I have the same problem get survivors or killers from Japan, Germany, Russia, South America and I‚Äôm in the south east of the USA around Atlanta 
---
You want speed? Play fast blink nurse, leather face, hillbilly, devour hope on any killer. But if that's what you think is fun that's you.
---
I can 4K roughly every other game on Freddy, at least get 2-3 kills. I can‚Äôt get a kill with billy to save my life. He‚Äôs insanely difficult, harder than nurse imo
---
Legion is not the fun to play after a while. You just run at people and ignore pallets and windows. Killers hate it and survivors hate it.
---
Plague is looking like she is going to be good and a fun killer to play if you can hold out I would go for her.
---
Michael is just a basic M1 killer with a little twist and doesn't have much variety in his gameplay. Hes some where in the middle for both tier and fun factor
---
Spirit can be fun to play, is quiet good once you know how to play her so you can still compete in red ranks AND her perks are pretty good. If you cant wait for plague I would choose spirit out of the 4 killers you  gave as options.
---
TL;DR I would pick spirit
---
I‚Äôm gonna say Buu and I have no idea what his power would be but his mori would 100% be turning survivors into candy and eating them
---
You won't keep multiple people asleep at all times. Basically if you sleep one person there isnt a point to leave them because they will just go simply miss a skill check. If you come up on a group sleep them all then try to end the chase before they can wake up. 
---
Spirit because she‚Äôs top tier and has good perks compared too the other three
---
Freddy does not get free wins at all. I think he‚Äôs a lot stronger than many give him credit for, but against a good team you will struggle to keep people asleep, and there is little you can do it strong loops because all you get is 115% move speed to do that. Just because you may be good at Freddy does not at all make him a stronger killer than half the cast that does have an ability to quickly win chases. Also, billy is objectively easier than nurse. Billy has an instadown that punishes people hard for messing up and isn‚Äôt really that hard to land, and map pressure that is better than nurse since he can so easily move across the map. Nurse is punished if you miss her power and the only way she can ever down people is if you can effectively use her power. 
---
Or trying to derank.
---
It‚Äôs helped me out a little. Hope it helps you!
---
And he has really good cosmetics and i am sure he is fun to play from his perspective
---
Well of course Susie.

The hatch stops the endgame taking hours as one guy hides in the corner

Hex: Doc‚Äôs Forearms
---
I like that this post was the fist legion meme to not get downvoted
---
Gotta protect yourself from the toxic afterchat.
---
Unfortunately they dont seem to like the idea of anyone having aesthetic emotes. The two emotes survs have are specifically to allow basic communication.
---
Hey, I'm a Survivor who complains about NOED
---
Not because it's OP, or even frustrating, it's because as a Solo Survivor, it's difficult to keep track of dull totems and there's no perk other than Small Game (Which is useless once you learn totem spawns) to assist on keeping track.
---
I think getting hit while killer is carrying someone counts
---
I do not disagree with you, but in fact, that's how memes work. Nearly every format that is out there and jokes get repeated so often until they are dead and new ones arise. I put my money on Janes thiccness as next running gag
---
Freddy ain't exactly considered easy by most but you do you.
---
I pretty much always fake a pickup when a downed survivor is at a pallet
---
Ive heard of them, they can probably be on both platforms. Over many games they can probably get a good amount
---
I like to kill Adam first, he just looks so...competent to me, like he's about to singlehandedly carry the match for survivors, plus I main Rin so that's appropriate. I will also kill Megs with the flowy hair, cause bÃ∂iÃ∂tÃ∂cÃ∂hÃ∂ Ã∂iÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂sÃ∂tÃ∂eÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂gÃ∂ Ã∂mÃ∂yÃ∂ Ã∂lÃ∂oÃ∂oÃ∂kÃ∂  it catches my eye somehow. 
---
The hatch system is bad and if that‚Äôs your way of dealing with it then more power to you I suppose
---
If only his power wasn't so poorly designed. He would have been a renowned killer as his aesthetic is easily one of the best in the whole game.
---
That‚Äôs why I said in my opinion. I can‚Äôt land chainsaws for the life of me but I can land nurse blinks a lot easier. 
---
Dead By Daylight has one of the most toxic communities in all of gaming. You can either choose to deal with it, or move on to other games where most of the playerbase isn't going out of their way to piss people off. I chose the latter, and am back to enjoying my time with online games again. Casual Rocket League matches have generally been fun. 
---
Also keep in mind that ranks reset on the 13th of the month, so even if you're at rank 14 you'll still likely  go up against very good players until everyone is placed where they should be... and then rinse and repeat in a month. But even then, there are still plenty of players that intentionally de-rank or use alternate accounts just to make the lives of players in the upper ranks absolutely miserable. Again, toxic community. It is what it is. 
---
Is that it's official name?
---
Nobody has mentioned that you should get Michael because he is the only killer (out of the 4) that requires auric cell purchase. 
---
You can get Spirit, Legion and Plague for I Shards. That‚Äôs how I would determine my answer. 
---
Yeah, 'cause I don't have enough free time to draw it :( (and that's why I haven't drawn anything for almost one year)
---
I think that's where we disagree though - unique stuff is good for the game imo. I don't like only having Nurses in my games, I like variety. That also means versing killers that I don't enjoy playing against as much, so I can improve against all of them.
---
Pull her out of the hatch when you move towards her.
---
Accurate 
---
Legay
---
I mean, I have a good time playing legion. It‚Äôs like my own personal middle finger back to the community for making a lot of decent matches feel like hell. It‚Äôs my pelvic thrust in response to every pallet tea bag, and every ‚ÄúI just body blocked you while my buddy sabo‚Äôd the hook you ran to‚Äù. My little personal fuck your pallet killer. Hate the number of times I have to hit you, but, trade offs! And just think, before this I was a Freddy Main. I‚Äôll take a few DC‚Äôs to the chin just to be a cuck back to everyone. 
---
I never thought I‚Äôd see the day where a Choices screenshot is posted on the DBD subreddit
---
I love how Killers respond to NOED criticism
---
Survivors-"NOED should be Nerfed"
---
Killers-"Look how overpowered Self Care is"
---
Then Self Care gets Nerfed
---
Killers-"DS is the Biggest Crutch perk ever"
---
Then DS gets Nerfed
---
Killers-"Everyone is using Adrenaline. It is such a crutch"
---
Their infrquency is the balance, making them as balanced as a purple will literally make no sense. Why have reds at all? What your saying has nothing to do with balance you just want them removed. 
---
I can't even use one of my mains cause I'd have to buy her. Plus I run enduring, spirit fury on trapper so I can't use my builds. 
---
I suppose a little button to activate a weapon animation with the character while maintaining normal speed would be a nice gimmick. Don't think it would be widely used in case it blocked the view while looking for survivors. 
---
Same with the sprite she just wanted revenge on her dad for brutally killing her mother and her. Both don‚Äôt seem that bad 
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
I mean if you do enjoy spending 20+ minutes in a game vs 3 gen doc with unnerving, overcharge, distressing, sloppy butcher on the game or azarov's during which he doesn't interact with you at all &amp; and you don't think there is a problem with that because it's unique, that's your preference I suppose.
---
Most people will land a chainsaw easier, and I guarantee if you put in a little time you would be able to hit a chainsaw easier than nurse blinks.
---
No survivors are smarter than that. If she wants to jump in the hatch, I have to hit her first. 
---
If the killer is coming back, or theyre camping I always try to body block, even without WGLF.
---
2 months, 4 months, a year, since Freddy‚Äôs release. 
---
*GRIL
---
Im confused as to what you even mean by reset tbh lol
---
Score on for the boys on console!
---
From my experience lately playing killer at ranks 10 to 1 on ps4, it doesn't matter if you're playing Legion or not. Odds are that survivor who dc'd was probably going to do it regardless of who you are.
---
I get disconnects with Freddy. Freaking Freddy..
---
  I used to play this game as a survivor main and complain about killer DC. Because I felt like THAT was super frequent. 
---
But holy guacamole. I think survivors dc at least 2 of every 3-5 games. It's insane how frequently it is.
---
hes stuck in the animation survivors are in when they hide in lockers, they stand up straight when in them
---
...did you... read what I said? all killers have the same exact field of view on all platforms
---
The Killers already got Self Care and DS nerfs.
---
If hatch was nerfed would you be cool with a Survivor stealthing around and hiding in a locker for the next 30 mins?
---
I farm a lot with legion when I feel bad. I never thought I‚Äôd receive toxicity for that but one game I had 2 weeks ago I was spammed with -rep comments and the post game chat was hell. Apparently it was a crime to own the Joe outfit.
---
Doesn't sound like he's talking about prestige. 
---
Hard to practice looping when you're constantly crouched.
---
Freddy is too high on the list, also,n Nea is missing
---
If you are new to killer starting with wraith is my recommendation. 
---
You will likely be terrible at finding crouching/hiding survivors at first (I certainly was)
---
Wraith allows you to walk straight up to a gen and know if survivors are there or if you should move on. You will not have to waste time searching around rocks and trees and you can get right into the part of the game you need to master (the chase).
---
Once you know how to run the loops and tiles I would recommend moving to a killer you want to really learn. Feel free to stay with wraith. But most would move on to hillbilly or Myers. 
---
Thanks how does the Mori thing work I was obsession and he went tier 3 and all he had to do was hit once and it Moried me
---
Maybe I need to rephrase it, because yes, I understand this.
---
On console, you're stuck at turning in a clunky manner at a set speed. This combined with the low FOV means that you can only view a certain area within a timeframe, and too high of a sensitivity leads to it being more difficult to control how you attack, and easier to get juked.
---
On PC, you can turn around faster and at your own pace, meaning that a survivor trying to juke you won't be able to if you just look around. This compensates for the low FOV, because you can find the survivor easier while it still being easier to hit a survivor trying to juke you.
---
Does this make more sense?
---
Add on. It‚Äôs called Judith‚Äôs Tombstone or Cracked Tombstone. 
---
The obsession had nothing to do with it. 
---
I would like just having the option to play the blood wipe animation (successful_hit) whenever I wanted. Meaning I could just run around as Clown laughing hysterically.
---
Wish it was a full miners costume, the top half sucks.
---
Doing objective as killer bad! 
---
I'm surprised you havn't seen the Legion memes. A lot of survivors just DC if the see a legion. Aesthetically legion is cool. Multiple people and all have cool outfits, but game play wise they are a bore. only 1 good perk too, discordance.
---
Nice to see Nea right there next to Claudette...
---
what was the joke dude?
---
Rank reset was the 13th.
---
And this is why DBD is so toxic

Looks really cool, been waiting on some updates trapper skins.

I know, i was 12 last season, yesterday i played and got from 15 to 14 and got 3 level on david but i loosed all of it, the same happened to the two friend i queued with.
---
Was hoping I wouldn't get this answer. Thanks anyway 
---
Alright thanks 
---
Buy em all
---
When you get the 4k against the full bloody Claudette swf 
---
An already scummy killer uses an unforeseen strat that has literally no skill nor counter play and guarantees downs in a matter of seconds. "Wow what an interesting strategy, let's not fix that"
---
Sprint burst is actually not a chase perk. You use it bedore the chase even starts.
---
It gives you a head start so yeah I consider it a chase perk. 
---
Damn boi she thicc one thicc ass boi

I feel ya ddude... 1388 now.. 
---
There are Legion mains?
---
The better survivors wilm filter themselves out eventually. So you will be playing people who are supposed to be at you rank.
---
I main legion - I played Nurse before and was really good. I got 4K‚Äôs almost every game. And before I get a reply back saying ‚ÄúloL nUrsE is So eZ liTerAllY nO sKilL lOL!‚Äù I mained pig as well for quite a bit and was also really good there. I play legion because they are fun, fast pace, and I genuinely like the character. I‚Äôm in no way saying legion is hard. But claiming that only skill-less assholes that are bad at the game flock to the character is just whining. 
---
Should i wait it out or just keep getting dicked on?
---
Wait it out
---
Rank reset is this bad every season. 
---
By far the dumbest system in this game. Especially if you play solo survivor. 
---
When people talk about how the addon is a problem instead of addressing how people just casually DC if they don‚Äôt like the killer being played. 
---
Absolutely not. A M&amp;K Nurse up against controller survivors would not be fair in the slightest 
---
That doesnt really prove anything, some lobbies are still bugged and never fill up for some reason though you might be right I have no way of knowing, where is that site getting its data from?
---
fetal frenzy...
---
Maybe I‚Äôm being stupid, but explain &gt;_&gt;
---
lmfao peak survivor entitlement and ignorance 
---
Not true, everyone DC's anyways, Im just joining them. We are on a strike against legion.
---
Freddy isn't fun to play against. That's probably why you got those DCs. 
---
I just thought I was unlucky considering I‚Äôd only just gotten the game and tried playing killer only to get matched with people who had high-level perks and high ranks...
---
I guess I technically am unlucky for starting out at such a time though I suppose. 
---
That‚Äôs not a counter though, any legion with at least 10 IQ isn‚Äôt gonna lose you even without scratch marks.
---
Being an asshole because other people are doesn't make you not an asshole.
---
Even then that's a bit of stretch because his saw is clearly of industrial make. It might've even been a tool used by his father once upon a time to cut down trees and the like.

Fps russian üò™

Playing Legion is a dick move, you deny 4 oyher people an unfun game, theyre are dcing to save 15min of their day
---
true

So if im the last to DC im an assholr? Maybe I dont want to farm or give Legion points
---
Thanks for your encouragement!üòò Reddit is a really friendly community!
---
Nah. Just Fuming Mixtape and "All-Seeing"-Spirit I think 
---
Nah you're not the only one. This clearly is a another problem on the list this game already has. Doesn't help some of the memes you see online are about how little gets fixed compared to how much is actually broke.
---
At least you can do something in the game, with killers like nurse, spirit you are dead if the killer is good.
---
If the killer isn‚Äôt Trapper or Wraith they‚Äôre OP automatically, sorry, I don‚Äôt make the rules 
---
Or you can skip all the nonsense and DC and play against a fun killer, such as Michael
---
Yup. Though generally I just like to discuss the match. 
---
#ARE YOU READY FOR SOME BULLSHIT?!

How is that? What‚Äôs the difference between a console survivor and a PC survivor.. there isn‚Äôt much

Can relate lmao, but why do this to poor wraith,he‚Äôs already shit let him be
---
Wraith is invisible 
---
Dangerous assumption 
---
This has two meanings........ one worse than the last
---
CLOSE THAT BITCH
---
The problem with  leigon is that he ruins the core mechanics of the game.
---
Chases in dead by daylight is centred around a simple premise. While killers have much faster movement speed as survivor, survivors have faster mobility in terms of vaulting windows and pallets and being able to drop pallets to slow down the killer. 
---
Now when you add a killer that is faster then survivors and has an ability to move faster then the survivors in ways including vaults then what counterplay really is there?
---
Survivor matters less. 
---
Killer is a different story. 
---
There are 97K people who are subbed to this subreddit, that‚Äôs only a fraction of the whole DBD community. 
---
Who am I to disagree 
---
Alert is the special perk for who?
---
The devs don't understand that the partial invisibility only surprises newer survivors, it doesn't work well against experienced survivors one they know the wraith is around.  
---
  
---
They just look around for a shimmer and run away, making his special power useless.
---
Yeah, we‚Äôve been experiencing it again today, as well. It‚Äôs been horrible. I used to have green ping all the time - now I‚Äôm lucky if I‚Äôm in the yellow. It‚Äôs usually around 500. 
---
They nerfed him if there‚Äôs a survivor left, shit never happens
---
lol, I've had this happen to me too. It occurs when you press the button to activate the flash light as the game is loading
---
Thats a large fraction
---
Well PC survivors play against those nurses. So why is it bad for console survivors to play against those nurses if there isn‚Äôt much difference between survivors?
---
Your fault for ruining the game for everyone. Easy report and BP tbh.
---
What is moonwalking and how is it a exploit? it just looks funny from what I know about it.
---
Unfortunately, he just has so little chasing power it's awful. Poor guy needs some love from the Devs, but then people will probably bitch. :(
---
I can't unhook you in front of the Tier 3 Myers without getting close.
---
Perfection at its perfection.
---
no
---
indeed
---
.huH
---
PS4 and Xbox is completely fine. There‚Äôs no substantial difference between a PC and console survivor, but there is when you play killer. Playing as Nurse on a controller is near to impossible, whilst Nurse‚Äôs on a M&amp;K can be absolute gods. 
---
Getting away from any killer is easy when you know the game. Hence why I said Freddy isn't fun to play against. You lose him and 2 seconds later he's right back on you because he can see you from across the map. Then God forbid you're playing with people that do not know how to play against him... Easiest way to break a keyboard/controller.
---
Travel the map and the seven gens
---
Not really. 1/4 at best. Like I said, this sub is extremely circlejerky about this stuff. 
---
I know right? I recently bought the Joe outfit and I've been getting way more toxicity than when I had the Letterman Jacket. .-. I thought Joe was supposed to be the "chill" Legion that people wore when they weren't trying too hard.
---
Frank = Default "tryhard" Legion
---
Julie = Newbie Legion
---
Joey = Chill Legion who's playing for fun
---
Susie = Basic Bitch thot who's probably tryharding but laughs it off with "ha ha I didn't know XD"
---
What's dangerous about a rational explanation?
---
Fatigue isn‚Äôt really punishment, it‚Äôs there so that survivors have a chance against nurse. Missing is just one of those things that you work towards not having happening a bunch. The better you get with her the less you‚Äôll miss. 
---
As far as being slow goes, the nurse isn‚Äôt really gonna be chasing a survivor by floating towards them, and generally the nurse will just blink around the map outside of chase as well. Her little downsides are numerous but the massive upside of instantly being able to teleport on a survivor and hit them in a chase massively outweighs everything else.
---
Spirit is for sure a good killer, but nurse will always reign supreme due to an ability that grants the best map pressure and chase potential in the game, and as a cherry on top it comes without cool down.
---
Soooo... is this more of a meme or is this community genuinely filled with a bunch of people thirsty for MM?
---
It was a joke
---
Wait, what?! One of them can pull their Ethernet and cause an 8014?!?
---
PC survivors have a good shot as both survivors and killers are using M&amp;K‚Äôs. Shredding console survivors using a M&amp;K is like winning the Paralympics when you‚Äôre completely healthy. You won a gold medal, but look at your opponents. 
---
My guy,Empathy is muuuch better now even at all tiers! 128m is basically infinite when you think about it. It's now 64m at tier 1....64!! Bond at tier 3 is 36m mind you.

I usually take it if 3 or more have items, if i see flashlight or key i might take as well.
---
Yeah I can see that, is that bad though? XD 
---
***"david king's whore"***

Okay
---
"Lol git gud kid"
---
Some of them want to cleanse you 
---
It gives you about an extra second against standard terror radius killers. It gives you around 8-10 seconds to hide against no terror radius killers. Having a 10 second head start against a wraith really gimps his power because all he has is stealth. Works effectively against pig, michael, tinkerer killers, hag and spirit.
---
Pretty okay perk. Isn't top tier meta, but it's atleast viable to run.
---
Except they are doing something about it. McLean said on his stream that after this new chapter goes live they are going to discuss legion and his rework. 
---
Just because somebody plays a character doesn‚Äôt make them lesser or they don‚Äôt deserve fun. That‚Äôs not how a player should think. 
---
There is a point to complain because now they know how much the community hates legion and they are working on a rework, and you know what? That means Freddy‚Äôs rework is delayed once again, so I hope you‚Äôre happy. 
---
You can‚Äôt blame the player for playing a character, and they deserve just as much fun as everyone else. 
---
Yea. The without a cool down thing is pretty decent. The breathing after a teleport would constitute as small coold down. Almoat like how hillbilly runa into something with his chainsaw. 
---
Personally I have 200+ hours as nurse and do easily better with Spirit, mainly due to a controller halving your sensitivity during a blink, the frame drops during a blink on console, and the slower sensitivity in general post-blink. She‚Äôs definitely strong, just personally I have Spirit as #1 as a PS4 killer.
---
You deserve it. Stop using nea and balanced landing. It's a dick move to do this to the killer. Stop juking. Killers want to have fun too
---
Spine chill and premonition don't work against t1 Myers
---
Are you really calling in for *ANOTHER* freddy need so soon?
---
Exactly!
---
But about the rest you said. I played Julie when I first started playing legion. I play joe when I know I am going to farm. And I play frank when I‚Äôm tryharding.  So your pretty accurate 
---
I can blame the player for playing legion, I literally just did, Behavior wont come out with a rework for a long time
---
Thanks to his most recent buff he doesn't suck anymore, but he's still far from being a very good Stealth Killer.
---
I personally wish he was like Tier 1 Myers while cloaked (no aura reading and no detection perks), but I'm pretty sure that would make people upset.
---
Did you even watch the clip?
---
Fair 
---
I'm an all time survivor main that's getting into killer recently and I decided to pick up nurse for the first time....Oh boy......
---
....that shit hurted.
---
So I went back to playing Billy and I dont think ill return to her again lol
---
Then you‚Äôre a bitch. More than the people who play legion. It‚Äôs not the player‚Äôs fault for playing a character that the devs made, it‚Äôs the devs fault for making a broken character. 
---
legion is fine, people just like to complain
---
You want the jump from 3k to 4k to be handed to you. Cry more 
---
Actually it is their fault, they clicked on legion, and name calling isnt going to do anything wtf
---
I can admit the controller sensitivity isn‚Äôt as good as it is on pc, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs the end of the world for her. The frame drops can be an issue, but it‚Äôs possible to play around them and still be just as good even with them. 
---
Spirit is a great killer, but as someone who‚Äôs played about 700 hours of console nurse I‚Äôll always end up cringing when people say she‚Äôs not #1 on console bc of optimization or something.
---
It‚Äôs their fault for playing a character? Yeah fuck off. You can‚Äôt blame the player for a broken character, you blame the devs. 
---
I have never met a single person who plays as Susie who isn't massively defensive about it, and also isn't a massive fucking thot who uses "kawaii" language and acts all cute after abusing Frank's Mix Tape and the moonwalk exploit all game.
---
Yes, but Legion has 0 counterplay, no matter what you do there is nothing you can do to stop them. Doctor actually takes a small amount of skill while they don't 
---
casuals... :(
---
Its as much their fault as it is for your parents taking off the condom
---
You need to put a /s on that.
---
I've met more than a few people in-game who would say exactly that and mean it 100%.
---
I feel like they're in a rough spot with Freddy, and I don't envy the position they're in.  Even if you put any potential legal issues with changing his power aside, they're damned if they do, damned if they don't.
---
If the rework ends up closer to Hag, Trapper, and Wraith changes where it takes the current power and builds some addons in while giving QoL tweaks, they'll get screamed at for "not doing enough," while if they completely change it the people that actually play Freddy will be complain that his unique playstyle was sacrificed for a more generic playstyle.
---
I myself am simply hoping the changes aren't so drastic as to leave me without a comfy killer to play.
---
micheal needs to be higher
---
I mean this sub is infested with a bunch of killer mains who do nothing but circle jerk about how weak killers are and that survivors should nerfed to the ground.
---
You hack their up? That's like instant ban there asshole
---
Yup. But for me, getting sent back to 10 lets me enjoy a mixture of fresh and experienced opponents. I just wish I could stay at 10.
---
You literally have no way to prove that lmao. That's just a big stereotype.
---
what
---
I'm sorry but I call bullshit.  I've been playing this game for what feels like forever,  and I have maybe ran into this 2 or 3 times.  14 in a night? By different people? Are you following one person around while they are dropping everything?
---
I'm not saying that there aren't bad survivors that use adrenaline or that only good survivors run it.
---
I'm saying that the particular breed of survivors that you described (the one that is too scared to do anything the entire) doesn't use. It doesn't go along with their playstyle. 
---
Can't tell if this is sarcastic or not
---
Lol at the killer mains in the comments. "Its part of the game just git gud" 
---
Yet I bet they're the same killers who dodge swf, toolboxes, and p3 skins
---
Not us console plebs lol
---
Nah i just send it then nothing so it scares em
---
Especially after rank reset
---
Most people will be able to tell where the killer is coming from anyway. It benefits you because if you see that it's staying on longer than just a second or two you know that the killer is actually coming your direction. This gives you a little longer to walk away and get away from where you are, rather her than have your scartch marks give you away to the killer. This is a great perk for new survivors. 
---
They're probably gonna make him super strong.
---
The community will have an aneurysm if he isn't top 5 after the rework.
---
Could you actually walk through it? This happens all the time with me but I just bounce off of it.
---
at what?
---
Me: oh look, rank 19 Billy with 2 perks, how cute!
---
Sees ebony mori
---
OH SHIT
---
He's a partial stealth Killer who requires the player to build up his power before it can be used. This is done by "stalking" Survivors. When his power reaches level 2, he can be used as a normal Killer. At level 3, he gains a slight speed and range boost to his vault and lunges, and his attacks enable Exposed on the Survivors. However, level 3 only lasts a few moments before draining out back to level 2. Each Survivor has a limited amount of "power" that Myers can absorb, and eventually (assuming that the game lasts that long) he will have no power left to feed on and will have to rely on basic mechanics.
---
Level 1: Reduced TR, reduced movement speed, and lunge.
---
Level 2: Normal stats.
---
Level 3: Faster vaults, longer lunge range, and Exposed.
---
Best outfit in the game IMO.
---
One time i played him and ended up having a survivor disconnect the other three were gen rushing and bc of my luck when i started patrolling gens (moving counterclockwise) i literally didnt find anyone until only three gens were left. But when i did i stalked all three at once HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHHE. he‚Äôs pretty fun but spamming tier-three starts feeling a little scummy
---
I get where your coming from. I generally favor killers but can do most survivor dailies easily enough. Though there's no ritual I hate seeing more than these two: 
---
1. The Initiation: Perform Co-op actions for 180 seconds. 
---
2. Mors Ambitio: For anyone but Trapper, Myers, or Wraith. 
---
Barfblade? 
---
Micheal Myers has 3 tiers 
---
Tier 1: Super small terror radius but slow
---
Tier 2: Slightly small terror radius but normal speed
---
Tier 3: Only lasts for 60 seconds, your terror radius becomes very large, you become very fast and you can one hit down survivors. 
---
How to tier up: You need to stalk survivors, while you do that you move very slow and it can give survivors a sound effect that ho hate stalking them. You can‚Äôt stalk one survivor infinitely, there‚Äôs a limit for each survivor. (About 1.5-2 tiers per survivor)
---
Advice: Stalk whenever you can, but don‚Äôt give up an attack to stalk unless you‚Äôre close to tier 3. 
---
Be careful not to be seen before you‚Äôre able to attack a survivor once surprise and stealthis Myers‚Äô best trait. 
---
Message me if you need for advice! 
---
Exactly. Anything longer than 20 seconds is just a waste of time. If you've gotten 3 killer then you've already won the game. 
---
Cool look at my comments and we can both share stuff we find
---
Yeah, I'm glad this is getting fixed next patch. 
---
I feel. I‚Äôve been trying to complete a daily for a while. I just have to survive as Laurie, except I‚Äôm a level 1 Laurie, and everyone lobby dodges when I load in or tunnels me. Like, alright. Cool. Thanks.
---
I had one where I was a rank 18 killer and had all rank 2 survs (think some were rank 1 cause I killed them)
---
I didn't even know that it needed to, but yes it did 
---
People find him to be boring to play.
---
Now that I think about it, this could be a somewhat less annoying alternative to iri heads.
---
**Iridescent Head**
---
A glass-like Hatchet head moulded from The Fog itself. The blade is warm and reverberating with The Entity's power.
---
* Thrown Hatchets **ignore map collision**.
---
* Reduces maximum carried Hatchet amount by **3**.
---
*The iridescent glass cuts through reality itself.*
---
Can you send me a good build possibly something that can help with slow movement, or the stalking cap? Any build will do as I haven‚Äôt played him yet I‚Äôm buying him just after I send this
---
I like him he‚Äôs fun if you can play him right 
---
Accurate

Are three man lobbies completely out of hand or is it just me? It takes me FOREVER to find a match because every lobby gets the 3 man bug. Seriously, over 50% of my survivor lobbies are broken. This matchmaking should be reverted because it's been horrible since it got deployed.
---
I think overcharge instantly give you 3 super hard skill checks that if you miss, the gen regresses by 7%.(basically a reverse bnp) 
---
shitpost? I dont see anything wrong here
---
I‚Äôd love to hear your tier list since 0/10 have been correct. 
---
Sorry that we‚Äôre trying to dispense justice
---
Okay message me. 
---
Nah. We can do this here so you can educate the common public with your wise views. 
---
Yea, they keep mailing killer easier and easier and it‚Äôs starting to get really fucking boring. 
---
I‚Äôm good luv, enjoy 
---
Brutal strength is really good with him 
---
No.
---
Why are you being downvoted? 
---
Noed isn't meta, noed isn't gamechanging, gunrushing is a thing, you suck. 
---
I kinda get the post. But i could see you matched up against those in the old matchmaking system.
---
Not at all! As someone who plays legion regularly 
---
 (I don‚Äôt use franks mix and cold dirt or noed)  that addon doesn‚Äôt help legion put pressure on survivors mainly because survivors can‚Äôt tell if its being used. Outside of it helping legion find  survivors early on in the match it could be replaced with with the pigs surveillance perk. 
---
You‚Äôre clearly a reddit warrior so I‚Äôm just gonna back off, enjoy life. Get outside sometimes, it‚Äôs nice.
---
I dont get it?
---
I mean apart from spirit and hag being 1 tier lower than they should be it‚Äôs honestly not as bad as what usually shows up on the subreddit 
---
Just stay awake man bring spine chill. It will make you more likely to trigger a skill check.
---
Welcome to online gaming lmao
---
Personally, I'm not burned out by the game as much as others. I'm not that old into this game(I started playing it around clowns release and summer bbq). I enjoy playing killer and survivor, trying new perk builds, different playstyles and different killers. Playing different killers keeps the game refreshing for me. I don't have a lot of friends that play dbd so I'm mostly playing solo survivor but swf is fun in the rare occasion that I get to play it. I came from cod, fortnite and overwatch, 3 totally different games from dbd(1 is fps, 2nd is battle Royale and 3rd is team-based), while dbd is asymmetric so dbd feels like a refreshing change from all the years I spent grinding cod. What keeps me coming back to dbd is different perk builds, bloodpoints, new content and some other tiny reasons. 
---
Would be neat if he could phase through walls while uncloaking maybe
---
Salty killer with the same generic whiny post
---
Isn‚Äôt confirmed that it‚Äôs wraith and nurse though?
---
That‚Äôs a good point
---
It‚Äôs more about a survivor dogging the other survivors and letting them die just so they can escape. Not about getting a 4K
---
Dodged
---
***GOD***
---
Well first let me set some ground rules. Obviously im mostly basing this off of power useability and things like movement speed. He has base movement speed and he really wont be able to get a chainsaw hit at a decent loop, besides downing really, he has no alternate way to use his chainsaw making him basically an m1 killer unless a survivor is new and doesn't know maps and cant loop.
---
This would be totally fine. I've done both and actually prefer survivor with a controller anyway. 360s feel easier to do. 
---
Not for me. It's like you spend all game healing or do without but play the game with a 1 hit down. It's going to get even worse once they buff thanatophobia. 
---
I hope you're joking, wake up is terrible
---
Just do away with the Rank System already. Jesus Christ....
---
so just because you've had worst matchmaking makes it not bad in this case ah alright
---
Borrowed time should be god tier
---
Self care should be good but situational
---
Empathy should be lower
---
Resiliance should be higher
---
Bond and Empathy should be lower
---
Everything else is ok, maybe wake up should be higher.
---
well most level 20's\~ literally have no perks at all, so even though we're only 5-6 levels away from him it still makes a big difference
---
&gt; But I also don't think Freddy is the worst killer either.
---
Heavily agree.
---
Yes but at the same time, if they dont go after you, you can take a hit for the person that saved you and you cant get juggled anymore
---
bad b8
---
Agree with you there, leatherface is trash.
---
One game I literally escaped only because I had Lithe. I was taken off the hook and the Clown came back to tunnel me. I ran and hopped over a window, got the three second speed boost, and managed to gain enough space to run all the way to the other side of the map and out the door. I love that perk.
---
It‚Äôs situationally good or not used. 
---
You made bond god tier. You‚Äôre 100% joking. 
---
your Post? Yes 
---
My comment? not at all, its my honest opinion.
---
I see a bunch of new players in the lobby, whats wrong with that?
---
Trapper should switch with Wraith, Clown should be lower, Freddy higher and Hag at A tier behind billy. Legion a bit lower as well. I think Plague might need to be lower too but I need to test her more
---
Love it 
---
not to be danganronpa on main but i thought this was hajime
---
Legion has an addon to put his terror radius on all the map, don‚Äôt know about HB though
---
I mean he was running NOED so...
---
Kidding ofc lmao
---
Distortion is trash against Freddy, he will burn through the stacks super quick.
---
Feng Min
---
Sadly good ping killers/survivors are just toxic cunts who abuse the power of good ping. Every single killer I've played against with good ping camps, every single survivor slams pallets down near other survivors and clicks flashlights while following me the entire game. 
---
Only enjoyment I take from the survivors is when I run rancor and its them cause you bet your ass I'm mori spamming a couple times then going through it 
---
r/legioncirclejerk  
---
Ok now I want this to be a real sub. 
---
small game is trash and bond is God Tier? well okay mister 
---
Why isn‚Äôt no mither god tier? You clearly have no idea what a good tier is
---
I should mention that Mike has a slightly faster vault speed and slightly longer lunge in EW2 as well.
---
TERRIBLE matchmaking tonight. Its Saturday night, east coast USA, and normally I can find games pretty quickly as survivor and killer. Tonight as survivor...i cant find a killer with under 300 ping...and its been 15 minutes now of trying to find a good lobby.
---
Guess Ill be playing something else tonight.
---
That's right. You're all brown ranks. Besides, there's a shortage of players lvl 20 - 15. Do you expect them just not to be matched up with anyone? If they're going to be matched outside their bracket, it's better with other brown ranks than green or purple.
---
Borrowed really only helps against tunneling or camping but it serves no other purpose.
---
Self care is god tier because it removes a very big restriction that solo queuing gives in the fact you have to depend on others 
---
Empathy is very good for knowing when to do such things and lets you know who is in a chase before they go down.
---
Resilience really isn't good unless you 99% yourself but then that just makes it so if the killer gets the jump on you or you are in a dead zone it will screw you.
---
Bond is very good for cooperation with randoms.
---
Wake up is very bad because if you just have a good memory you will know where the gates are, if you want the door open faster, use leader.
---
Now ur making me want it to be a real sub
---
You just posted a pic of a black girl with glasses and called her Claudette
---
That‚Äôs a yikes for me dawg
---
I know right, im such a fucking idiot smh
---
It‚Äôs okay also pharmacy is a god tier perk as well 
---
The other one that said Legion didn't get downvoted
---
Ok but you got the point, there are no drawbacks in using this add-on, it only gives you benefits.
---
Small game is only good against hex and noed, serves no other purpose. Also its not hard to find totems.
---
First thing I thought of, it's awesome
---
Heavily disagree, I'd call it the worst. Sprint Burst makes any place in the map safe, Dead Hard is a second chance button in a chase and Balanced Landing open up so many loops/infinites.
---
So much meme potential
---
‚ÄúEverything else is ok‚Äù 
---
so Pebble is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù perk and premonition is better than spine chill? 
---
Self ships are crime against nature and blight among the fanfiction community. 
---
kidding. 
---
Where did Shirtless Myers come from? Also, why are we fetishizing a mute killer who stalks his victims with a buff body?  
---
David King is better
---
Ikr, fuck self care just use plunderers and pharmacy and get a med kit
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
i dont even know if this is a literal joke or you're actually mad.

i hope it's the latter.

Woah man like I didnt analyse everything, I just took a look at top and bottom
---
Dude honestly replace dead hard with slippery meat 
---
Sadly they're fixing it next patch. It was worked in the PTB already. 
---
I feel like it‚Äôs so hard to play as Laurie for those exact reasons
---
Hex and/or noed are in pretty much every game.
---
And many people still struggle with that.
---
Plus, it also counters hag/trapper
---
would be OP with a lot of aura-reading perks
---
You‚Äôre literally missing half of the list if you only look at the top and the bottom. 
---
Well...that's one way to handle it
---
Yea I can do them if they‚Äôre trapper or Myers too and that‚Äôs it
---
New Shirtless Michael skin? Done. 
---
I like how people can't read the "shitpost" tag
---
Man i honestly like legion and just play him without exploits. We need to stop calling him op or up because it really depends on the player
---
Trapper cant cut off loops
---
Clown is decent if you can aim and think ahead
---
Freddy is garbage (keep in mind no perks or 
---
add-ons)
---
Hag is just too slow and you can mind game her traps
---
Legion is good if you know how to properly use them.
---
Plague is a hard killer but she can fuck people up, also she gets rid of insta kits.
---
Myers just isn't that good (keep in mind no perks or add-ons)
---
Are we blessed or are we cursed with not seeing any form of post game chat?
---
I'm confused, why don't they?
---
I made Holidays in Thailand and played against this guy.
---
And he has 12k Hours...  is this even possible or is this account hacked?
---
&gt; Borrowed really only helps against tunneling or camping but it serves no other purpose.
---
Yeah, and that is crazy. Sometimes killers have to camp and tunnel to secure kills, and Borrowed Times gives the hooked survivor a free extra life. If you get borrowed timed when the gates are open its a free escape
---
&gt; Self care is god tier because it removes a very big restriction that solo queuing gives in the fact you have to depend on others
---
Not really, why bother healing when you can just do gens and heal with Adrenaline. It can help, buts its not worth the effort most of the time.
---
&gt; Empathy is very good for knowing when to do such things and lets you know who is in a chase before they go down.
---
And what are you going to do with that information lmao? The information it gives you doesnt help you at all.
---
&gt; Resilience really isn't good unless you 99% yourself but then that just makes it so if the killer gets the jump on you or you are in a dead zone it will screw you.
---
It is still good, helps with the dont heal do gens then adren strat that is meta right now
---
&gt; Bond is very good for cooperation with randoms.
---
It is good but I wouldn't say god tier
---
&gt; Wake up is very bad because if you just have a good memory you will know where the gates are, if you want the door open faster, use leader.
---
Its better than a lot of perks in the tier higher e.g Boil Over
---
Lmao im sorry
---
Nice name, $2 toe pic 
---
Im saying if a smart and very strong survivor was using them, a strong survivor wont get messed up by traps or hags traps and they can find hex easy
---
Such a shame too, I always felt he and Spirit would go better together with their backstories:/
---
I completely disagree on both Dark Sense and Alert. The ability to see the Killer's aura that consistently (at least with Alert) is wonderful. 
---
What did you use for the dirt? Paint or just dirt?
---
that can apply to Purple add-ons too. MOST killers have 1-2 add-ons where if they suddenly got an infinite supply of them overnight and decided to run said add-on every match they would be hell to face match after match.
---
"SLIPPERY LITTLE BASTARD!
---
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS."
---
Would combo with Concoction nicely, but would still be less annoying than a ranged insta-down
---
&gt; Trapper cant cut off loops
---
Uhh trapper is higher than Wraith on this list buddy
---
&gt; Clown is decent if you can aim and think ahead
---
Is countered by simply camping the pallet
---
&gt; Freddy is garbage (keep in mind no perks or add-ons)
---
I've gotten into this argument before and I can't be arsed getting into it again
---
&gt; Hag is just too slow and you can mind game her traps
---
110 move speed means nothing to a killer that can bounce around the map if you play her right. Her traps have very little counterplay, not sure why you are saying you can mindgame them.
---
&gt; Legion is good if you know how to properly use them.
---
Chases take too long even with moonwalking, slow move speed so no map pressure. Only good with addons, and thats how you are judging this list.
---
&gt; Plague is a hard killer but she can fuck people up, also she gets rid of insta kits.
---
Theres too many hoops she needs to jump through to be a slightly better Huntress
---
&gt; Myers just isn't that good (keep in mind no perks or add-ons)
---
Best snowball in the game, good stealth and chase potential with his slightly/considerably better lunge and vault speed in EW2/3. I put him high B tier.
---
I would be rich, if I had a nickel for everyone David that farmed me. 
---
Most of the hate is that his power is just so exploitable in so many goddamn ways.
---
Examples:
---
1. Moonwalking; give someone the stab, turn around and follow til they either run out of mend time or can‚Äôt stop without going down.
---
2. Pallet vaulting; pallets are now next to meaningless unless you can land them 100% of the time every time, and only if you either haven‚Äôt been stabbed or you‚Äôre getting tunneled with mixtape.
---
3. Rowboating; ever wonder what it‚Äôd look like if you could spam lunge into infinity and beyond? Well, with 100% missed attack reduction baseline, Legion can. And he moves goddamn faster than he does just running. Exhaustion perks? Legion can just gapclose easy with lunge spam without a need to cut the chase and wait out a timer.
---
4. Stealth is impossible; so help you god if y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt solo on your own gens. If he isn‚Äôt running discordance, his power‚Äôs reveal of non-deep wounded people on stab is going to sell you and everyone else out if you‚Äôre too close.
---
Yea that‚Äôs about 500 days or so, games been out for about 3 years
---
Why did you use stab wound studies? Actually no point other than moon walking. 
---
Thats the plan dude
---
Kinda reminds me of Julie from Scott Pilgrim. 
---
Since it reduces the deep wound timer i thought it would combo
---
lot of toesuckers wanna rub shoulders with this old man. can't be givin the goods out for free
---
Yes, fantastic perk combo, really a must have for most M1 killers.
---
I mean, hatchets without charge speed addons are easy enough to dodge. So if a huntress is running iri + infantry belt, she'll have no charge speed buff and only 3 shots. That's pretty fair tbh. With fragrant tuft, you can usually get most of the gens done before Myers pops it. I will agree that moris are unfair and kind of ruin the game.
---
It doesn't, better just to go for a second frenzy hit. 
---
I'd say Myers is A Tier. I rank him above Huntress, personally 
---
I'll heavily disagree with that. Sprint Burst makes it so that you have to walk everywhere unless you want to risk not having it when the killer shows up, Dead Hard is often affected by lag (and can easily be baited out by the killer, not to mention that they'll just wait for you to use it after the first time), and it's extremely obvious when someone is going to use Balanced Landing. 
---
I mean that if the bar was smaller, the second hit would take more %
---
Im going to put this simply, im going on solo queing use possibility
---
Empathy - you can know when to pop gens / save / heal / etc.
---
Bond - very good for solo queuing to know what to do considering you cant talk to them.
---
Resilience - Adrenaline strat only works for late game but not the entire game
---
Self Care - God tier because you heal yourself while people work on doing gens, also again this perk helps for the entire game not just late game adrenaline strats.
---
Wake up - it just simply doesn't help at all, boil over can confuse killers and make them head to farther hooks because they don't get auras of close hooks.
---
Borrowed Time - Don't get caught.
---
some people really will dc if you down them with legion
---
Shut your mouth she‚Äôs beautiful... (in her own way) :(
---
why do their backstories make them go better?
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, yes.
---
Try to lunge through the pallet if you can, whether you slap them or not. If you do manage to hit them, the pallet will instantly break due to Spirit Fury and you can get right back into the chase due to Enduring. This is an especially easy way to get an almost-insta down.
---
Oh good, and the killer compounded the assholery by downing the unhooked person rather than the Claudette.
---
I don't think you understand what "unpopular" means
---
Probably not. The outfit seems to likely be an homage to [My Bloody Valentine](https://drinkinggamezone.com/img/games/movie/my-bloody-valentine-3d.jpg), a slasher movie about a killer miner.
---
I don‚Äôt really see the point why we shouldn‚Äôt, for consoles (Xbox and PS4). This way we‚Äôll have more player-base and will solve the queue time for sure! 
---
Thanks now I have a mental image of a nurse in a racing car
---
 Nurse be cheating 
---
Quality trolling ngl
---
The V O I D
---
This comment section is so wholesome
---
My thoughts exactly, As much as I enjoy the killer cosmetics some could of a been a new killer. Always thought the clowns ability would have fit a  plague doctor killer.
---
If you are facing a good killer, it wont be a 3 min game so adrenaline strat is very rare against a good killer
---
Self care is all about time management.
---
Wake up doesn't help at all " cool those gates that i know where they are i can see permanently "
---
Im saying borrowed doesn't help you, im putting these perks as how they help you.
---
Empathy, again you are solo queing so knowing when to save and do things like that is very good and can make randoms have coordination.
---
Don‚Äôt bully bing bong
---
omg thank you so much
---
I‚Äôd like to get technician on my no mither gen rush build though,don‚Äôt get why people are hating on it
---
Yes,extremely scary for survivors too
---
Simple fix against no ed - BREAK TOTEMS
---
Adrenaline is better at getting to doors and it heals you
---
That's why I was asking. BHVR did a licensed terminator skin for death garden, I thought they'd done something similar in dbd.
---
Just make it r/dbdcirclejerks so we can post every circle jerk, I have a few I‚Äôd like to share ;)
---
Imagine thinking WAKE UP is good and bond isn't.
---
Bond gives so much information and increases your general efficiency.
---
Wake up lets you open the exit gate like, 2 seconds faster. Yea that's trash tier.
---
Just don't miss skill checks
---
&gt;iTs a kIlLeR BuG, tHeY DoN'T CaRe aBoUt tHaT.
---
From PTB patchnotes:
---
Fixed an issue that allowed the Huntress to throw her hatchets through multiple car assets in the Autohaven Wrecker's maps.
---
Some of them want to be hit by you
---
Idc about downvotes, its reddit. Moris are defintly imbalanced, but making it a 2 hook thing is killing them
---
Also BNPs should just like double the size of great skill check zones
---
Legion has absolutely 0 map pressure. They're only good for tunneling. You can injure everyone pretty easily but they don't have to heal because you're so slow in a chase. They're straight up bottom tier and unfun to play as or against.
---
Myers is very good. He can catch survivors by surprise, even mid chase, at tier one. At tier two he's a pretty decent m1 killer but if you use stalk well and synergise with tier three then he's incredibly powerful.
---
And while you didn't mention him in this comment: Wraith is in the top 2-3 tiers. He has brilliant map pressure since survivors are unsure of where he is at any one time and has very good standard movement speed. He has no issue closing distance in a chase at all and is an overall stable yet very powerful killer. 
---
Definitely, 2 weeks are only 336 hours long
---
Congratulations. 
---
You have proven that you assume too much. 
---
Where did I say bond wasn‚Äôt good? 
---
If you think bond is god tier, you‚Äôre a clown. 
---
Come on champ. 
---
Leatherface really isnt the best for it. Doc or Legion are absolute monsters when ti comes to points vs LF
---
She actually did a collab with an english internet personality where she had a bunch of toy guns and shot a picture of somebody up like terrorist propaganda. You can really see it then.
---
whenever you blink you hop in a f1 racer style gokart
---
all hooks are replaced with beds shaped like cars
---
the saw is replaced with a copy of F1 Racing
---
That isn't hacking. I've had the same thing happen on console. Something with trying to vault in a locker and the killer trying to grab you.
---
I dunno, but I know it's not a hack, you just tried to locker juke him and he probably grabbed you on his end.
---
Unless I'm wrong and you didn't try to vault into the locker but this happened to me before.
---
And that's usually the third hook.
---
Wraith gets a massive speedboost when cloaked.
---
Legion is hot dog-shit.
---
Your personal experience in no way dictates his actual ability as a killer.
---
If you're not a troll then you're either brand new or just stupid. 
---
New DS should be in "Good but situational" imo
---
If they don't tunnel you with it you can basically go body block for the person that saved you.
---
Huntress is map dependent, and people who know objects that eat hatches can easy 5 Gen run you.
---
Wraith is amazing because he forces every pallet by uncloaking 
---
When you finally get that one toxic Claudette who teabags after every pallet
---
FR  tho imma make r/dbdcirclejerks
---
I don‚Äôt like where this is going
---
With frank's mixtape it only takes 3 hits in total.
---
Not only me then... good 
---
Bet you've gotten fucked by a legion before
---
Wraith is so trash, he is simply m1 killer. His power doesnt help at all during a chase
---
Myers is just simply weak imo, that's why i put in the title "opinion*"
---
I have that same Eevee next to my computer monitor.
---
He needs to be able to carry all of them lmao
---
Suckiest game of hex roulette I played was as doctor with this swf group on the swamp map. They had 1 gen jockey while the rest had spread out and found my totems. At first they just poke at them stealth away or use it to get me to chase. So when defending 1 the other 2 worked on cleansing. I wasnt nurse so I couldnt protect them all. 
---
The FIRST and ONLY 2 they broke was ruin and devour hope. TotH and haunted grounds stayed up for the rest of the game. 
---
I wanted to leave since I was legit perkless at that point. You win some you lose some. 
---
For the sound fam
---
Troll it is. 
---
And I can try to hit all greats too
---
I don't hate playing against Legion, guys. I mean
---
... Am I really in the minority here? I mean, there's so much worse. Wraiths tend to facecamp and Freddy's are just the worst to play against.
---
You can simply not throw down the pallet and just stand there until the wraith starts to uncloak then just run around the loop again
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs kink shaming 
---
&gt; If you are facing a good killer, it wont be a 3 min game so adrenaline strat is very rare against a good killer
---
Lmao no
---
&gt; Self care is all about time management.
---
Yeah, dont spend time healing.
---
&gt; Im saying borrowed doesn't help you, im putting these perks as how they help you.
---
Ehhhh weird way to rank them but ok
---
&gt; Empathy, again you are solo queing so knowing when to save and do things like that is very good and can make randoms have coordination.
---
You know when to save, when the guy gets hooked. Dont waste time running to the guy getting chased.
---
Yes. BUT it's not working like you think it's working, I believe.
---
For every extra survivor working on a single gen, all survivors on that get a -10% penalty to their repair speed.
---
One survivor: 100% speed
---
Two survivors: (100% - 10%) x 2 = 180%
---
Three survivors: (100% - 20%) x 3 = 240%
---
Four survivors: (100% - 30%) x 4 = 280%
---
However, Prove Thyself counteracts the penalty.
---
Two survivors = (100% - 10% + 10%) x 2 = 200%
---
etc.
---
It works on generators as well from my experience.
---
But bond is god tier.
---
You see your teammates. Which means you can:
---
*Find someone to heal you easily.
---
*Avoid running the killer to your teammates.
---
*Get the killer off of you by running TO a teammate.
---
*Avoid going for a double save.
---
*Know who is getting chased/where.
---
*Know what pallets nearby are getting thrown down.
---
*Have a general idea of things going on near you.
---
*And more probably.
---
With the totally not garbage wake up, you can:
---
*See the exit gate! (which you can without the perk)
---
*Let people see YOU open the exit gate!
---
*Open it like, 3 seconds faster.
---
*Bonus that this perk becomes useless if someone else opens the exit gate before you!
---
What a fucking loser lmao üòÜ 
---
Also tech is not 100%, also greats are super easy to hit and if anything you should be hitting the great skill check too late not too early
---
And where everyone knows about it 
---
I put no lmao as it is obvious that you have not versed a team of survivors that want to win. No matter what you do, what killer you are, they will most likely win as they will hump a gen and adren out. 
---
&gt; If 1 is hooked and the other goes down, the downed gets hooked and im still running to the other hooked, what you said about empathy only makes sense when the person originally hooked is close
---
Too situational to be considered with exhaustion perks.
---
Bahahha. Nice
---
I want to clarify that I am definitely NOT saying the matchmaking in this game works well, BUT this game is pretty well balanced if the survivors were SWF. Their average is 7 which isn't far off from your level.
---
Most survivors just use Dead Hard to make the killer whiff a hit, then get whacked a few seconds later. Only a good survivor will use it right. And I've baited survivors out to waste their Balanced Landing and then come back to them soon after that when it's more advantageous for me, when they have no exhaustion perk and are no longer able to jump down away from me.
---
I do they still don‚Äôt count the hit
---
Nope.
---
I've had the same exact thing happen to me on console, it's just a bug.
---
I am using exactly that, but can't find one for unlimited keys!!!! I just want my shirtless Michael üòñüòñ
---
The problem is not all killers have a sense of honor when that shit happens. I 100% also tunnel the shit out of the person who unhooks like that, because frankly that person is just an ass.
---
But I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been in OP‚Äôs position and received zero mercy. Always is infuriating.
---
The pretty Susie.
---
I'm not sure about when you're cloaked, I don't play Wraith.
---
I'm in the same boat, still chapters away from getting my Michael üòí
---
Well she's still pretty but she's kinda fucked in the everything rn.
---
My guess is your wrong. Dedicated servers in 3 months and you expect a freddy rework too??? Pshhhh that would be too much work for bhvr. Especially considering the disaster im expecting for dedicated servers
---
Legit just downloaded the game last night, thought Michael was hot as so tried to stay with him and I came across this quote üòÇ
---
I'm not sure I understand the "make a ruthless murderer of the innocent into a cute normal person" fad on this sub reddit, but I think people missed the point of DBD lol
---
When you find a lobby*
---
[Here's the original.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afa23vQZsLM) Kinda shitty not to share the source, OP.
---
A ~~bit~~ **LOT** of both 
---
Seems like a good use of it!
---
*huntress misses hatchet* FOOKIN' DEAD 'ARD
---
They added one shot hatchets to the game. Did you really expect a lot of critical thinking from bhvr? 
---
Oh yeah? Whats wrong with that?
---
Nurse should have been with wraith. Also, what's up with pigs gloves? Or is it skin? It goes all the way up to her neck lol. 
---
I don't believe they were SWF, or at least there were no signs that they were. At most, it was a two man. (Not full offerings, some without items, not immediately going in for saves, all that.)
---
I could be wrong, but either way it's kind of eeeeehhhh to get players that high of a rank VS a killer with my rank. I still killed them, but other killers might have had more trouble. 
---
I think it needs to be worked on some, I've seen more and more of this on both sides, and while it's not too big of a deal it's also like: "Why did I get matched with this?" After the match ends.
---
Huntress add-ons. That is all.
---
its only when the sun is bright, so it‚Äôs not all that bad
---
Just gonna... shake this bottle for a while now... just wait...
---
Killer: Overcharge. I'm mid rank and honestly, people cannot hit that very difficult skill check consistently. It regresses the gen and you know right away if someone went back on it. Unlike Hex Ruin, it can't be taken out.
---
Survivor: Empathy. It's amazing because you can tell exactly where the chase is taking place so it gives you indirect visual on the killer. Also, you can go give some heals!
---
Is this for the us store only? 
---
I am pretty sure it should match your desktop res.
---
Damn you really going for it huh lol. Tho I completely understand as I have a triforce and human transmutation circle on my person. Good luck though 
---
It's not really about me in this situation-- for some, this could be very off putting. This wasn't really meant to be a complaint post, but more of a: "oh, but why?" post. 
---
A person in a lower comment pointed out that it was likely their average and that's why I got matched with them, and that's okay. It was just weird, and one of the more extreme cases I've seen of rank imbalance, aside from me getting matched with a rank 1 a few games before this. 
---
I probably could have worded the title better so that it didn't look like a rage post! 
---
What perks are you currently running?
---
Thanks. I‚Äôve been looking for days and I can‚Äôt find it anywhere
---
Everyone in the community hated Brigitte. She required no skill at all and was super strong. I saw people climb from gold to grandmaster because of her. It's actually good that you stayed away from competitive because it was just full of people arguing and fighting, trolling, going afk, throwing the match and making fun of each other. It was fun and actually competitive at times but it was mostly just stress and anger. Especially in high ranks, where people's egos are up the roof. 
---
Mercy went through quite a ride. In season 6-8 she was a must pick and was extremely overpowered(in competitive anyway) due to her ability to regenerate health super swiftly, fly so high that she's impossible to kill and revive 2 players. After that shit show she got nerfed a lot to the point where a lot of mercy mains just gave up playing her(this discussion went from dbd to overwatch somehow). The person I came across was playing survivor 
---
Probably a biug. Email BHVR or report it 
---
doluda filha da puta.... that‚Äôs what I got called after i yanked a guy from hatch. It really made my night!
---
Yes I know mate but I'm saying even in solo que it isnt worth it over other better perks.
---
Nea?
---
Feng min with Plunder‚Äôs, Lithe, Dance W/ Me, and Adrenaline.
---
The title but UnIronically 
---
Will the new dlc be 50% off?
---
Nah that just looks like bad lag, with lag switchers  the game looks like it speeds up all of a sudden. 
---
When they hit the lag switch all survivors are standing still and they can move around freely, when they switch back on the game world for survivors speeds up to catch up with the host. 
---
Might have to ask the developing artist and behavior themselves since it's a close unique and original tattoo as it seems to be the case as of now. I'm sure they won't deny such a devoted request of body modification that praises such design.
---
Good night üòû And Thank You üôè 
---
Yes, but its a very high quality perk because it can really help also with when you are in a chase not bringing the killer to injured to people. Also its not situational basically at all, everyone gets a injured and its good to know whether you should go save someone or let that guy self care on the other side of the map while you do gens
---
Pls be safe fam. The fog understands the world doesn't.
---
I think legion is bad in the way that franks turns them into actual killers (although a bit too effective) and without franks against good survivors its gonna be a 1k bp farming match. 
---
Killer on ps4 is fucking painful. The more I rank up the less I want to play. 
---
*Joke about it being blank because claudette is invisible.*
---
They need a secondary obj
---
I've gotten so many messages on PS4 calling me a "camper" or mad because I use NOED. The funny thing is I have messages blocked so they send a friend request with the message LOL.
---
But it's such "gimme money" üò≠ 
---
Do you know of a similar game for PC?
---
Lol you've never played a good wraith obviously. Wraith is a top tier killer with his built in windstorm. 
---
Basically, killers have perks that rely on obsession (like rancor) so if no survivor has an obsession perk (like decisive strike) otherwise the perk wouldn‚Äôt work yk?
---
Because the rank reset 3 days ago. Give people time. Not everyone has enough free time to play.
---
Looks great. If anything just dirty up the flash light a bit if possible. 
---
I don‚Äôt think the list contains Dark Devotion, another Obsession Perk.
---
you merely adapted the shape x pig i was BORN IN IT
---
Trapper and nurse would be a cute couple 
---
Not when my team mates just camp pallets and start self caring against that sloppy butcher when they finish mending, or when they're rescued off the hook.
---
You get keys pretty quickly if you have school/work or something and it's mostly just an issue on books that are completed.
---
This is Labell's work.  Check out their [twitter](https://twitter.com/Labell_xx).
---
TBH I don't believe these are the artist's real ships as many are assuming.  Just the pairings for a killer's gala.  The artists favorite ship is Huntress+Jake because Calm Spirit&amp;The Huntress' animalistic nature, something something...
---
Hey! You! Don't say that here.
---
When I feel this coming on I just type gg and close it out before chaos starts. 
---
She is, do not mind her, sometime she hurts you but that's only because she likes you.
---
Just give it a chance!
---
BHVR: Lmao we totally forgot üÖ± 
---
They asked if they were the last does it make them an asshole. If they're the last to DC the game is already ruined and it's 1v1 vs the killer.
---
Bring sprint burst. Makes dodging the first hit pretty easy, then he becomes a normal killer.
---
That's why I ran Enduring during my last games as Legion, some weeks back. With Enduring, there's only one moment where a pallet drop can screw you over, and that's during the second hit of the initial Frenzy. After that, you don't have to respect at all, you just don't enter Frenzy if they're camping the pallet, until they drop it. Enduring makes it so they can almost never reach a second pallet in time, even if they drop the one they're camping. And if you try to just "bait", and leave the pallet, then the fact that I don't respect at all means you don't gain very little distance.
---
It's seriously boring, once you learn how to do it.
---
Top tier is a stretch, certainly not in the same tier as Freddy. 
---
[removed]
---
What about my skillchecks? Did you give them a chance? DID YOU?
---
What why do you had different perk icons?
---
Player level is account based, goes to 99, and is independent of character level. Character level caps at 50 and varies whether you‚Äôre playing as Meg, Jake, Wraith, etc...
---
I mean, sure, w/e have your weird fetish, but maybe some of us want an intellectual doctor that doesn't actually know how the human anatomy works because they didn't that the time he was alive.  
---
Leeches anyone?
---
He isn‚Äôt saying you can‚Äôt win a game against him. The match is just incredibly boring and personally I‚Äôd rather not waste 10-20 minutes of my time not having a fun game. 
---
*Survivors disagree with that.*
---
That doesn't help me, is this from an official trailer or something?
---
So blood rising can't go above 50 tho since it's character level, not account level.
---
Ohh got it thanks 
---
No problem fam, reply to this comment if you ever need more info, I‚Äôm not that good at the game but I know my fair part ;)
---
GOTTEM!
---
But you‚Äôd think the nurse doesn‚Äôt need a gentle type at this point? Like, she tried out the gentle life before she snapped, obviously didn‚Äôt work for her at the time lmao
---
Look I'm around devotion 8 lol I have no life this game for a long time XD and I can firmly say Wraith is a top tier killer. Easily one of the strongest. His ability ignores so many perks its insane, he can force any pallet immediately, he has amazing map coverage, and can sneak up on people insanely fast. 
---
Wait, the blue arrows are bad on here, man.
---
I don‚Äôt actually know what blood rising is, but according to google it should cap at 50 so I‚Äôm not sure how someone would have over that
---
Probs hax.
---
‚Äúofficial trailer‚Äù 
---
Yes. Behaviour put a shot of her ass in the game trailer.
---
It‚Äôs just a screenshot from ingame dude, calm your hormones. 
---
How dare you doing gens! You should be trying to get killed by walking in front of the killer. 
---
Another legion meme, funny. 
---
glad seeing the same regurgitated joke 10 times every time I visit this subreddit.
---
I think legion would be in a better place if they increased the timer of both frenzy and the bleed, but made ti work in a chase.  
---
No clue what the end results would be, but it would be a cool 
---
PTB to do to test out.
---
I have P3 all perks clown and let me tell you, all decent survivors have muscle memory of how far the loop is and how long it will take to get there but clowns ability used decently will cause survivors to fuck up. 
---
New item pink mori gain the ability to murder 1 female survivor by your hand this trial
---
Legion bad. Change my mind.
---
Why do people want to nerf Legion? they are what the survivors have been asking for all this time.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/friendship-ended-with-mudasir
---
This.
---
I've done this once or twice in the past just to bug people. It gets a little giggle out of me when I've had a frustrating few rounds sometimes.
---
Stop lieing, he has no fucking pressure. No one is scared of him and he has nothing to help him in a chase, also windstorm aint shit, simply when they start to uncloak leave the pallet for a simple distance, if they stay cloaked go back to the pallet, if they uncloak. Simply book it
---
Then Legion shows up and the four of em tag EVERYTHING
---
Nah have you seen her mori? After she strangles them she touches their face so gently. Both wraith and nurse were tortured into killing, and wraith probably has lots and lots of pent up anger from being forced to kill innocent people forever, you can tell by his mori. Wraith needs nurse to calm him down
---
Carefully.
---
OP has cosmetic mods.
---
So does that not mean that Balanced is incredibily powerful? That you have to disengage when you are at a certain area?
---
Most legion games are fine now. Just focus generators.
---
:( sorry man, at least he's not the worst of the worst
---
You're just too good! :D
---
OMG!?!?! THIS IS AMAZING! I love your art style! Could you do David next? :) 
---
Thing is though no matter what loop theres always a way to counter clown. Short loop? Just run it normally. Long loop? Camp the pallet and force the Clown to break it. I don't want to hate on your main and by extension you, but the only reason why people think Clown is good is because people dont know how to counter him. Camp pallets, get him to waste his bottles then loop him normally.
---
&gt;chat text feelings
---

---
Picking and choosing your battles. 
---
I'll see what I can do. I am kind of working on another project, but I'll keep David in mind:)
---
Do it again! I think it's an amazing idea!
---
Thank you so much! I'm exicited to see your work! 
---
Until a killer can play a game against survivors without ruin and win around 50% of his/her matches, this game can in no way be called balanced. That hasn't happened and won't happen in this current version of DBD.
---
And SWFs come with built-in Bond, Empathy, Alert, Kindred, Object Of Obsession. Want to truly balance the game? Give a killer 5 extra perk slots when facing SWFs. But that's not going to happen because SWFs would flip out. It's ok for the goose, but not for the gander.
---
That is one weakness of him (that you can manipulate even) yet he has many more strengths. He has good stealth, the best stall in the game, the best tracking in the game, good m1 mindgames (due to how short he is, how deceptive his lunge range is and how foggy the dream world is) and he is also the best killer for slugging. He has a lot of strengths that most of reddit and popular streamers just brushes over, hence all the f tier placements
---
Noice
---
Fready
---
She looks very soft
---
It wasnt letting me heal people in the injured state either, I knew about the dying state thing.
---
His "built in windstorm" is just trash. Any good survivors knows if a wraith wants to stand at a pallet you just leave the fucking pallet. People will say there killer main is one of the best. I play billy, myers, hag, trapper, leatherface, legion and im working on huntress. If i was someone so far up my ass i would put billy at s tier because i always get a 3-4 kills as billy but no, i know spirit is as good as him and i know nurse is the best. I also really enjoy legion and i know how to properly get kills and do chases and end them quickly but even i know, if a survivor runs to a safe area before you can even get close you're fucked. Legion is b - tier because his ability is very simple but very complicated at the same time.
---
Welp agree to disagree. I'm just not a huge for of the myers house infinite lol
---
Idk why people take winning so seriously. This game is not that serious. 
---
Flashdwight.. Trademark pending.. Lol
---
Same with that state, holding the run key will prevent healing.
---
I'd imagine because it would hard counter him. But I did always find it weird that he was immune and not wraith. 
---

I'm betting that's going to be fixed at some point, at any rate.

---
I‚Äôd have preferred crying fortnite dances but this is beautiful

Not enough people know about it sadly, and so there isnt enough people to complain about it, much like Clown and his 50 million bugs.
---
I guess you haven‚Äôt had people raid your steam account for a week or two because they are salty
---
Spine chill should be god tier, it is useful in so many situations
---
A plague doctor has no creativity. Their non licensed killers always have so much work and creativity put into them. That's why we got a creative take on  plague killer.
---
Looking back I should have made this shorter..oh well
---
Uh... What was the point of this?
---
I got a few tips.  
---
First of all, Listen closely - the lullaby is a clue he is there, and, even while invisible, he moves the world around him. If you see crows randomly fly away or brush/corn/etc moving, he is there.  
---
Second, he is useless when you are awake, so stay awake as often as possible, and , when asleep, focus on getting to a gen and failing a check to wake yourself up, OR bring self care and take a hit. Both can work fine.  
---
Third, loop that prick. Freddy has no movement abilities, so as long as you can get to a pallet or window, that will always be a good bet. When he is putting you to sleep, look for a pallet or vault, and RUN to it. He cant hurt you for a few seconds, use em. When you have those seconds, gain distance.  
---
Fourth, if you cant hear his lullaby, that means he can see you. Stealth is useless against Freddy, he is the king of hunting down survivors. Make sure you fight back the, really only way you can, by focusing on waking up.   
---
Finally, Freddy is weak at first, but he is a late game power house. Make sure that you get all the totems when you have a chance, Freddy almost 100% of the time uses noed. If you are the obsession, FOCUS ON AVOIDING HIM AT ALL COSTS. When he gets you, he likely is using remember me, which makes opening gates a bore.   
---
Basically, focus on gaining distance. When you have distance, WAKE UP. Stay awake as long as you can.  
---
Build wise, I recommend   
---
Self Care (A Must) - Adrenaline (Wakes you up if asleep at end game) - Spine Chill (Slight Hint that he is coming) - and Sprint Burst (A few second head start is a HUGE thing against Freddy, use it to find a pallet or vault).  
---
Good luck against mr Sharp Hand Joe.
---
Nvm I listened with audio now, thought it was a gif
---
I sorry
---
"Hey guys, it's me Jane Romero, and my new but very sick friend, Adiris, vomited on me and got me sick now. I somehow got Mike sick too. FML."
---
If it makes you feel better it happened to me on console. Getting DDoS‚Äôed sucks and Microsoft doesn‚Äôt give a damn if it happens to you 
---
As long as i get spirit im fine
---
Eh, glasses are good for people who are bad at tracking. And the ring is great for totem protextion builds
---
Idk why but wraith reminds me of richard ayoade here
---
You are missing the point. Killer with mouse=advantage. Survivors with mouse=about the same. 
---
My life is complete 
---
Thought the 100 times as powerful would make it clear that I was being sarcastic.
---
SQUIDWARD!
---
...GOOD!
---
I think the issue is that that only balances them for the Killers. For Survivors, the fact that they're rare doesn't mean they're any less crushing when they're used.
---
If there was a perk that had a 2% chance to kill a survivor at the start of a match, would you say it was balanced?
---
With a bag that says nursery right next to it XD I love the joke
---
I don't dislike that idea, but I don't think BHVR will do it due to the changes needed.
---
Well, then come as close as you need to
---
Nea thats not where you stick a flashlight
---
It takes zero effort to play a game as it was intended, so I‚Äôll never understand why people would go so far out of their way to be complete and utter fucking pricks.
---
Probably because Legion is bad.
---
When he plays, he plays for a few hours and streams on twitch. Can be cringey but it's worth checking out his stream
---
His twitch is Mc_ote
---
i like it, but the lighting really wouldn't hit her like that
---
Its not quite a plague doctor outfit it looks more like a masquerade outfit
---
Which he totally deserves for playing legion. 
---
Yo,is that flaming kitty?
---
Now is this r/askoujia but one word at a time? BTW, I fear this meme will keep appearing like these mafia city memes a month or two ago.
---
Haha didn‚Äôt even notice at first.
---
Hey, lying is a strong word for having an opinion.
---
The thing is I'm not even very high at rank 16, I prefer to relax to a horrifying  giggle on doc
---
Hopefully he is someday. Freddy is more fun.
---
Alright let me just browse Reddit a bit before going to-
---
and this is why I shouldn't browse Reddit at 3 AM.
---
Me: *types "gg" before the killer can leave*
---
Now I can't unsee that Eleven's look in Stranger Things 3 resembles Laurie.
---
How on earth is something like that "confirmed". Have the devs actually officially released anything that even says the killers have even met each other, much less.... gotten together?
---
This kind of stuff is so dumb. They are brutal, gruesome killers. Not people.
---
Ofc it doesn‚Äôt. But playing legion and complaining about dc is hypocritical. 
---
Not gonna lie this comment put a big smile on my face. Really happy I made you laugh :D
---
Yeah definitely not legit
---
Used to run it on Nurse, it is an awesome perk, but i don't need it anymore, i can predict survivor movement well enough/know their spawns/etc...
---
Amanda with a dress! Still my beating heart &lt;3
---
How do you get what I'm asking? I want to reset my character. I know you can save the files and then restart like it was a NEW game BUT I don't want ALL characters to be reset I just want one character.
---
You can reset/wipe old file. I have been looking up all night and I have read some good info but all I have seen was ppl wiping their whole entire game not just on character. 
---
500 something days
---
It's very map reliant though, some maps only have a handful of crows in some irrelevant corner of the map.
---
This gotta be a shitpost right?
---
Damn ace is looking kinda thicc
---
I usually stay around 10-6. Im not the type to seek out the dangers of high ranks. Partially due to them being better (usually) and my attention span is crap. Skill checks are easy but paying attention to everything thats around when on a busy map like Thompson House messes with my head. Being chased isnt that bad either but coming across another survivor or facing against legion or doctor just throws the whole focus out the window. Maybe its just my ability to track everything at once but skilless plays like these are no excuse. Id rather be chased all game than having everyone, one by one, get downed and facecamped til death.
---
Why do people call them op cause they have no counterplay
---
Would be good if there was a way to kick a survivor who is trying to unhook you.
---
NOED-boy*
---
Yeah, it's a total pipe dream, but I can dream at least. Any time I suggest something like this I usually get responses of "but then the game would be less fun because add-ons are what make the game fun", which I think is absurd personally, can they not have fun without buffs? Perks are already plenty of variety.
---
&gt; The killer controls the tempo of the match
---
Haha!
---
That doesn't make any sense.
---
Humanity never ceases to amuse me
---
Gotta wonder how they ended up like that did theirs parents hand them everything and never taught them manners
---
Okay. 
---
No please. 
---
I've actually always wondered  why they are standing and  not sitting around it.
---
Target can be a pretty dangerous place to work in and of itself !
---
It's okay bud, most people on reddit don't know how jokes work and are party poopers
---
Lol
---
Cries in console
---
Gabe Newell: These things take time. 
---
WHERE'S MY FUCKING HL3 GABE
---
Ye survivors need to not move at all when being healed. I was trying to heal a downed meg but she kept crawling. Could have fully healed her in the time I wasted on her moving.. eventually the killer came so I left her to die. 
---
owo fantastic art
---
It's usually posts that are somewhat shitposts, but not that are usually downvoted
---
Can't think of a game where I ever enjoyed playing against doc outside of low ranks.
---
i have over 2k hours. Doc was always a cutie to me
---
Well.. that‚Äôs cause legion really is trash
---
IT'LL HELP IF YOU JUST SING ALOOOOOOONG
---
have to assume you don't enjoy challenge
---
Nope, hate games where I end up stomping on the killer. It's just not fun playing a game where stealth mechanics are half the battle only to have stealth thrown out the window.
---
Everybody talks shit about small game till NOED shows up
---
\*insert a comment about debating if Freddy is actually a killer or not\*
---
Legion isn‚Äôt fun/lucrative to play as; at least, I just don‚Äôt know how to play as him/her yet. I need to level up some perks first anyways.
---
John Lennon
---
Lol true
---
Both the killer *and* the entity win. 
---
I‚Äôd like to think they have a mask collection over their fireplace. üòå
---
Maybe as balance the cant be charged so you cant cross-map snipe.
---
I imagine the wraith dancing w Lisa bc it's more of like. idk. taking his grandma to a ball or something skksk. not romantic or anything 
---
Whats the point of accruing hours? For reviews?
---
Yes. Campers everywhere. Its always the same killers doing it doctors hags and billies. 
---
GOD I PLAYED THAT GAME I'm praying for you 
---
I mean i get it. Sslome people know how to play good enough to where lower levels cant catch them. It happens to me from time to time if survivors have sprint burst. 
---
Tuesday release about 5-6PM UK time. 
---
Just tonight I was playing Trapper (not even close to my main) for the daily. I played like absolute hell but somehow got the daily AND 3 kills 1 DC. 
---
Post game chat: I say gg thx for daily. 2 survs say gg, last surv got salty ‚Äúno one fckin cares‚Äù. Told him I didn‚Äôt have to pick up salt from the grocery store anymore cause he delivered. 
---
i have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Doctor encourages you to be smart of moving: in his static field you can hide in lockers or embrace the madness, outside - can crouch for a bit to remove some madness which will allow you be in his static longer in case you need to save or hide without lockers. 
---
3 gen Doc is annoying, i agree on that, but ANY killer is and ESPECIALLY LEGION is much more annoying on 3 gen. you ALWAYS need to do gens smart way. 
---
if Doctor would remove all 2(!LOL) existing methods, he'd be op. is he op? no lol.
---
if you're having problems looping Doctor, you either get god tier Doctors or you really suck at being smart, sorry.
---
So what you're telling me is DS dies on Tuesday.
---
Wraith's opera outfit is pretty damn cool tho
---
\*Oinks in approval\*
---
I can't color for the life of me, but yea I love it too
---
Now with glasses
---
I don't think that scaring crows far away can help much, and Murphy's Law says the only time it will be noticed is when an injured player is near said crows.
---
Just a thought.
---
Bad survivors. Noed is good for a couple of good players. If its a bad team you can get the 4k with it. If they are bad you can get the 4k without it. Maybe there are a couple of good ones and you get them and the bad ones are so bad they don't help and can't help themsevles either
---
I do chase people, but I get rid of 2 pallets at **max** per chase in the early game. My goal is to put as many people asleep while also slowly getting rid of pallets, that's how you get dead zones. Survivors will feel more and more helpless, as they either need to find new gens with safe pallets next to them (wastes time, especially on theatre and game), or take a risk and go back to the gen they were put to sleep at - but this time there's no pallet there anymore, and you as freddy must be aware of that. 
---
It's just a more strategic way to play freddy. I know you can get kills by playing him "normal", but I hate gen rush, and that's what this strategy counters immensely.
---
no it needs to swap to nurse and wraith &gt;:(
---
So they‚Äôre all straight ? 
---
I get gen rushed a lot. If they don't gen rush me then i always do phenomenally. I may try this out to see if it works any better for me to prevent that. 
---
&gt;I haven't been playing for a while now and i see all of these legion hate posts, can someone explain please?
---
He is boring to play against because there is no outplay in a chase. 
---
LORE Man Trapper guy
---
No. Simple "cosmetic stuff". People like to see a lot of hours in their games.  Plus, there are leaderboards, such as [this one](https://steamladder.com/ladder/playtime/381210/) that show who has the most hours in a certain game. That's it.
---
There are tools that allow you to trick steam in thinking that you're running the game, while in reality you're not. Users like the one in the screenshot use this kind of tools. If you ask me, it's pretty dumb
---
Fax 
---
nice art!
---
Implying this is unlikely 
---
oh okay
---
Don't try to make it sound like survivors are just  bitching for no reason. Get off your high horse. Nurse literally ignores all game mechanics. There is a reason the term "Reddit killer" exist.
---
It's built into his kit. In T1, Myers is completely immune to all detection perks and effects. His aura cannot be revealed by things like Rancor, Dark Sense, Object of Obsession, keys, etc. In addition, effects like Premonition, Spine Chill, and "where are they" perks that don't reveal auras also don't work. It's to play up the "scary stalker" feeling in tandem with his almost nonexistent terror radius, and balanced by his abysmal move speed in T1.
---
I believe Tier III Kindred still works on him, but that's the exception, not the rule.
---
I love empathy for this reason, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs particularly underrated though 
---
I have a hard time with the 360 and juking as well. If its a bad killer i do go but good killers get me everytime. Then i run into face campers. I just don't get it. Before rank reset i was doing great. I guess it needs to balance back out again. 
---
Get rid of the showing other survivors when you m2 one and give him something in return
---
I wish they would not just stand there. Let the lobby be the actual campfire. You could make it a little bigger &amp; if they have items, let them be placed in front of them or beside them. 
---
That would also make use of the new campfire animations they added.
---
Maybe only for customization let them stand up &amp; sit down again when you‚Äôre done.
---
I think that‚Äòd be dope af.
---
Finally, some good fucking ~food~ rankings
---
I'll have a Legion with me so it'll be a bit more recognizable :p
---
Tunneling is fine. Especially if it isn't conscious. If you get dehooked and run off and we meet across the map its not practical for me to turn around and walk away. As a courtesy if someone gets farmed you best believe the person who did it will be taking their spot on the hook. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it was only patients
---
Thanks! :D
---
I would but my dad would murder me before I even tried :')
---
Yeah it is the left! But at that moment I just couldn't get it to look right tucked in lol
---
Daddy myers not looking too THICC here
---
Goddamn, I could never do that üòÇ
---
Its actually Ben Nye SFX dirt from my kit, I tried to steer away from paint as it just didn't give it the look I wanted :p
---
Trapper looking kinda quirky doe üò≥
---
I was maining killer. Gen pressure can go both ways. If people are getting gens fast a quick tunnel to take one of them out will tremendously help in some cases. If you get two after that it basically can halt the gens if you just make rounds to gens. The survivors will have no choice but attenpt to do them. Other times its only a tunnel because you just hapoen to be found again. If there is no other person around a killer isn't going to turn around and walk away from someone. 
---
I only watched a little he doesn't play dirty but he is kinda bad. Not queen is kinda good tho. 
---
Boil Over ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
As you can see, he‚Äôs also holding a bottle of that Thomson‚Äôs Moonshine. 
---
Are you on PS4 ? He‚Äôs half price at the moment, he was cheap to begin with now he‚Äôs even cheaper. 
---
I'd take off Tenacity for Decisive Strike or Adrenaline if this is really a fight til the last breath build. And like the other commenter said 4th perk should be dead hard. Don't forget your insta heal also
---
Huntress x Doctor = nah
---
Nice fanart (who's the author? Please, credit) I'd rather ship Huntress with Pig and Wraith with Spirit, though
---
I believe its to help compliment her power. Being extra tall helps her vomit over obstacles and reach further distances while vomiting. Even when she holds in the vomit she gets slightly taller. 
---
The tallness I suppose also helps display her head priestess status by making her look more imposing.
---
Smexy
---
I run tracking perks on him, mostly. BBQ, Rancor, discordance and M&amp;A. Makes hiding from him extremely hard, which is what this strategy thrives on. 
---
I agree with this list üëÄ
---
New item, black mori, for a reduced 75% bloodpoints and an increased 75% for the survivors, gain the ability to kill every survivor once downed
---
I agree, and was gonna come ask about it. If they saw it on YouTube, why not just link the video instead of uploading it to Reddit?
---
I took a look around and what i suggest is to get the 3d model and when you do you will find a texture for kates skin. Steam has the 3d model that you can supposedly download if you launch the game i think. I don't have dbd on steam so i can't download it to send to you. Artstation has the 3d model too and for the life of me i can't figure out how to download it. 
---
A very weird situation with Legion. Without add-ons, he is easily the worst killer in the game with lack of map pressure and no real synergy with any of the perks in the game. 
---
Literally a killer with no counterplay for his power yet simultaneously a killer that struggles to down people.
---
When you add Franks Mixtape, Legion becomes even stronger than the nurse. So strong in fact it's broken because he will always win with Franks mixtape. 
---
Never said it was the killer‚Äôs job to do that. Just said the killer doesn‚Äôt have a sense of honor.
---
In some cultures, it‚Äôs considered a dick move. Just saying.
---
Do you know, how memes work?
---
Okay. Thank you. This is very helpful. I appreciate it
---
Well, i am gay, so probably some males are a bit higher, but mhhhhmmm the 4 on S-Tier are so mhhhhmmm
---
You lot just gonna downvote instead actually trying to change his mind? Guess it's proof that people who like playing Leigon are braindead.
---
The issue with Legion is that his power, Feral Frenzy, allows him to vault pallets and windows. This removes the survivors ability to escape the legion. When the Legion hits someone with his power, all survivors in his terror radius are shown to him meaning he can run over and hit them as well. 
---
When a survivor has been hit with his power they enter a bleedout timer, the same as borrowed time. They have to run and mend for 20ish seconds. After they mend they are now in the wounded state.
---
Over the course of an average game, the Legion will likely force a survivor to mend multiple times. Mending is really tedious due to no skill checks and just holding M1 for 20 seconds.
---
Legion also has many exploits to abuse his power and make it impossible for survivors to mend, forcing them to be downed.
---
The final nail in the coffin is that Legion has an add-on called Franks mixtape that turns him from the weakest killer in the game to the strongest killer in the game. His power can easily down survivors and with the fact that his power has no counterplay he can usually win a chase within 10 to 15 seconds. 
---
As a Killer
---
- Legion has a lack of perk synergy due to his frenzy not working with many of the exposed perks and his 110% movement speed making him ineffective during chases
---
- His 110% movement speed makes him horrible for chasing survivors outside frenzy.
---
- Frenzy only hurts survivors and does not kill them. Very hard to kill survivors with frenzy
---
- Without add-ons, his frenzy can usually fail to reach survivors that just run away from him if they're in his terror radius forcing you to tunnel the one survivor you hit.
---
Did you just say #the mask guy#?
---
Did you just say __the mask guy__?
---
So basically your saying play the game like you would anyways? Very helpful advice... Also no, the Leigon nerfs have done nothing still a no skill required killer that will always win chases unless they are an actual vegetable.
---
It's usually a bad strategy. It preys upon your teammates being really altruistic and forgoing doing gens to instead watch you and try to unhook you. the game actively punishes killers by making their chaster emblem go down the longer they stay close to a hooked survivor.
---
The strongest camping build is called Bubbas basement. A killer takes a survivor down to the basement as the cannibal and then waits for someone to take the bait with insidious (Removes terror radius when standing still for 2 seconds). If a survivor comes down to save you then his chainsaw ability allows him to insta down the both of you.
---
If you are being camped is best to just sit there and wait the full 2 minutes it takes for a full sacrifice to occur and give plenty of time for your teammates to finish gens. Same goes for you if you see a killer camping then just do gens and let them camp.
---
well, after reading this it seems pretty clear that he needs a rework... but worry not!! his rework will come after freddy's rework :D
---
*in 3030*
---
The poor guys. My blinks were on target and we were on Freddy's map... no where was safe. Their fate was sealed before the match begun.
---
Lmao. You must be up against some shit survivors or be a really bad one yourself. Because a good survivor against a legion with no addons is no problem.
---
How many times do you play at a rank above 15 and not have add ons?
---
The real question here is where is nea and who dates her?
---
Probs leatherface
---
Pig should be higher especially if you've seen the adorable chibi keychain on eBay lol
---
Let's hope they don't turn Freddy into the new Legion by the time they get around to it in 3030.
---
Swfs dont matter. Problem is, if they make it just be stealth with no TR and able to instantly unstealth, thats just wraith, and theres a reason stealth killers arent really a thing, its better in almost every situation to, instead of being stealth, just be chasing and applying pressure. I like the idea but any execution would just not be fun. Doesn't mean I know what to do aabout legion, they're so fucked I don't even know where to begin with a new ability lol.
---
Upvote for you, a real man

Most boring thing in the game. I have no clue why people who camp play this game.

Uploaded! But I warned you that the vid is locker perspective, for reasons I explained in the comments

Probably both.

How is that confirmed?

Switch Pig with Doctor

This is so nice!

I'm so bummed I can only upvote once...
---
And I don't even get the huntress ships. How is she "wild"? She has the mind of a 7 year old. All this over sexualizing. 
---
&gt;I don't get why you are getting downvotes.
---
This sub is a hivemind - since it's popular to shit all over Legion, anyone enjoying it is a heretic who needs to be banned etc.
---
Shak shake shake your medicine
---
These characters are licensed from other franchises (Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Nightmare on Elm Street and Saw). I imagine the developers made a deal with the copyright holders for these franchises that they would give them a percentage of each DLC sold in order to have them in the game. If we all bought them with shards the copyright holders would have no incentive to allow their characters to be in the game. Hope that clears it up.
---
I really hate the "gen rush" crap. It's the ONLY WAY to live as a survivor (surprise, your only objective!) unless you specifically want to always be an asshole and only do two for hatch to spawn then wait for your teammates to die. 
---
As i understand it the original killers can be earned, and licensed killers must be bought.
---
They probably do some kind of profitsharing with the license holders, so they csn't give away those DLC content for free.
---
Small Game and Pharmacy are not trash come on
---
my thoughts exactly 
---
It's a strategy. A boring and scummy strategy, but a strategy.
---
She is tall like Myers and others. She just looks taller because of her head piece
---
How dare they not ship Pig with Huntress?
---
***THEY BOTH HAVE ANIMAL MASKS THEY'RE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER***
---
Surprisingly accurate
---
Yare yare..
---
Stop it

Whenever you blink you blink out of the fucking car.

Just switch the Doctor and Trapper around and we're all good.

(Huntress is my baby but sure)

[no one liked that]
---
That would be cool if you could throw leeches and as long as a leech is clinging to you every five seconds you can be seen. 
---
I think hes bad but i still like playing as him... i font know why... maybe its the challenge
---
Haha I religiously watched AHS so it‚Äôs nice to see someone who also has a lowkey obsession
---
I‚Äôm probably wrong, probably talking out of my arse, but I always thought the reason the licensed killers were paid exclusive because the devs needed to make money back off of actually getting the rights to these characters. If the license holders took a percentage of the licensed dlc sold, how does that work for auric cells that can also be used to buy licensed killers? The license holders don‚Äôt take a percentage of every single purchase of auric cells.
---
At the very least BHVR should make it so the oneshot only applies on a fully-charged hatchet.
---
You should cover their names as it goes against the subreddits rule
---
The mask guy?
---
NOED has joined the chat
---
oh, will do
---
I approve of this
---
Yea, its rough for me too. I'm just at the point where I'm hitting people at least once pretty good. I can at least get one hook now. My end game is decent with NOED. I'll get 2 kills sometimes. So I've improved. Check out the posts on here and check out some guides on YouTube. Those have some really good tips that will help. I'm just waiting on the part where she becomes deadly. 
---
This is so sad alexa... ALEXA!... oh wait this is a dead meme
---
I'm working on getting to that level. 
---
I think u reversed it
---
Legion x legion
---
I really don't understand these posts. Is this happening on PC? I play PS4 and I get no DCs when I play Legion nor do I see anyone DCing when I play against Legion.
---
Yeah, not too sure what he's going on about. If the goal is to just get the achievement it's easy. Getting it by just playing the game takes a while though.
---
Good luck, nurse is stupidly powerful. The traits that make a killer strong are:
---
1)Map pressure/mobility
---
2)Chase potential
---
3)1 shot ability
---
4)snowball potential
---
The nurse has the best map pressure in all of dbd. She can blink from 1 location to another in an instant and pressure that area. The nurse also has the best chase potential, able to ignore pallets and windows and end chases in a few seconds. She also has one of the best snowballing potential in the game, able to down a survivor and quickly blink to another. Although she does not have a one shot ability, that does not matter to good nurses because they can end the chase so quickly. Most killers are strong in an area and weak in another, but the nurse is just strong in everything 
---
The only super downside for the nurse is tracking. Stealth is pretty strong against the nurse but 1. Most survivors playstyle isn't stealth 2. There's a lot of tracking perks in the game like bbq and nurse's 3.most survivors don't even run stealth perks like distortion and iron will, they run perks like ds and adrenaline. When you start learning the nurse, you will get embarrassed but when you become good at the nurse, you're just going to stomp on survivors. I plan on becoming good at the nurse too when I move to pc
---
How do you score on it?
---
I have played a ton of legion, and have tried every combo of attacks and whatnot. 0 progress. 
---
Totally, I'm agreeing with you
---
I like the idea, but pretty sure she would be more powerful with this than with the insta downs
---
GOT EM. 
---
I think Daddy Trapper should be up with the others instead of Huntress.
---
I love being chased by Spirits (:
---
You think they have a dedicated network programming team? I think youre being generous if you think that. Their team is barely big enough to finish 1 killer 1 map and 1 survivor every month ish. And its still buggy as shit on release. Maybe youll be right but my guess is no. If it is happening itll probably be around halloween if anything.
---
Huntress is one of the hottest women i have seen in my life.
---
That's neat to know, I never realized that's why scratched mirror Myers is so damn creepy lol
---
What? People fucking love the Pig. Oink
---
No, if you think he isnt youre just a bad player sorry
---
Use Franks Mixtape and I can guarantee you that you will see survivors DC. Definitely on PC though not sure on PS. I think you will and expect some hate messages from survivors that dont DC.
---
Gameplay reasons, to help her vomit over objects. 
---
What is up with people calling their great drawings, "doodles"?
---
WHICH IS ALRIGHT SINCE IT‚ÄôS SUBJECTIVE 
---
Wait that's illegal

While I agree, I think the reason most killers (including myself) just think that generators can take too little time to complete. Because there's nothing worse than a game where you've hooked no one/ 1 survivor and 3 or 4 gens are already done. The game is designed around the fact people are gonna be moving around, so if the survivors actually stick to gens and all do them, it's faster than it should be. That's my two cents, but idk. To each their own, and I get the other side of the argument too.

r/woosh

Not sure why cleanse totems is typed out ironically. That‚Äôs literally a hard counter for it. Survivors run past dull totems looking for Ruin almost every game.
---
We need "The Father" too.

Oof

I noticed that too - he's taken control of that area.

Can confirm. Just received hate mail for using Frank's mixtape and for playing Legion who "requires no skill". On PS4
---
These are your personal preferences, not the community‚Äôs. 
---
Unrelenting on the nurse LMFAO
---
Yes, I can understand that, I don't use Frank's tape, but the others I played against were definitely using it and no one DCed. I think this is a real issue on PC.
---
Honestly, on console, you can exhaust Legion's frenzy quite easy as it's harder to control the killer at that speed around obstacles.
---
You're what this post is making fun of. Grow up. 
---
Sprint Burst x100
---
They'd much rather do fuck all about a Perk that is clearly so frequently used that it's just common sense to start thinking about doing things to counter/prevent it. But nah, 4 Survivors to cleanse 5 Totems is just too much.
---
ah you see, that was a nice cold dirt and frank's you used.
---
stop it.
---
You do realise that Gen Rushing is actually best done when people solo Gens, right?
---
Sounds majestic.
---
Doctor is straight annoying. 80% of the guys playing it goes for 3 gen strat and camp thoses, or drop a the game map. Not a killer I enjoy playing agaisnt.
---
&gt; I FUCKING BRUISED my thighs and SCRATCHED my arms to shreds over this Love-Hate game. 
---
How about you stop playing the game and go look for a psychiatrist.

What it this term "ship"

With the exception of the Legion

Useful, for sure, but far from absurdly OP.

Ugh I can‚Äôt get my point across

absolutely not, freddy should not get nerfed nor buffed, nor his perks, but fuck man theres space for 3 survivors between his claw and where i got hit

Oh, if you're not farming it's pretty darn hard. I must've played 10 legion games specifically going for it without farming and I had 0 progress. It's just so situational and never happens.
---
MYC is underrated?
---
deceptive yes thats one thing, but theres space between 3 survivors for that hit, thats literally tripling his weapon distance
---
So this killer could only be played at 1 single map? 
---
God know the great spider in the sky can make shit appear. Flooding a map shouldn't be to much to ask.... Or give it centipede legs.
---
on a side note, no where have i wrote to nerf him, or flared this salt/rant, simply a clip showing freddy tripling his lunge, like he does no matter, as someone who plays freddy a lot i can tell you this is not connection, 90% of hits should not physically be possible to connect.
---
I completwly agree with Tru3. This perk is OP. U til it is changed I wont use it.
---
STBFL is also really cool on Spirit. Hit and quick phase :D One of my favourite perks.
---
Omg I love Choices so much. I lost all my progress though and I don't want to replay everything.
---
Well, when Water appears on the other Maps you'd instantly know, which killer is being played
---
Hag and Spirit also have bare feet. Nurse too but she flies
---
Centipede legs.
---
It's a cycle really. Next week we'll get back on track with the hating of leigion.
---
Also great counter for NOED. Killer gets 4% MS and you get 6%!
---
I'd personally rather see trapper and meg but not everyone is into survivorxkiller ships and I understand that. But I do say trapper and huntress both fill the daddy and mommy roles specifically lmao
---
A Shark with Centipede legs? Whats the Backstory of the killer?
---
I feel ya
---
yea
---
Self care is monstrously overrated right now as it takes half a gen of time to heal yourself with it. WGLF reduces the grind but it's basically playing with only 3 perks. Low tier as it basically does nothing. Dead hard has a lot of uses that arent dodging a hit. Good, but not god tier. Balanced landing is the only god tier exhaustion perk imo since it opens room for vertical looping and it is the exhaustion perk that gives you the most distance in the game. Pharmacy is self care but twice as fast but you can only use it twice. It should be in the situational tier
---
bond is godly in soloq

Yup. 1,000,000 BP, 8k shards (another 600,000 BP from the Shrine) and 105,000 BP waiting to be claimed from rituals.

Well the reason I ship Nurse with Huntress is I feel like they're both carers. Like Huntress is just abducting girls because she needs a purpose. Nurse would like... tame her wild side and take care of her a bit and Huntress would bring her some wild rabbit from the forest for dinner lmao. 
---
Yeah, Ruin is broken on console, nobody can hit those skill checks consistently, and nobody knows to stop working in the gen until the sparks are gone to decrease the likelihood of getting another check and delaying repair even further. So most randoms just run around the map looking for the totem and become fodder for the killer.
---
Op you messed up big time rush

Hag spirit and nurse except nurse is paralysed and doesn‚Äôt use her feet

Claudette really is the legion of the survivors side.

I see multiple Claudettes as either survivor or killer and I already know im in for a bad time.

Have you reported them in-game? If not, the video is useless.

And you, my friend, are no better than people saying ‚Äúdelete legion!!1!!!‚Äù. Insulting someone because they play a game differently is rather shallow. I know we all like to win, but come on, at least don‚Äôt be an ass to the people who‚Äôd rather have fun then crush their opponents. 
---
It can be whatever you want but once the new chapter hits not only will your chaser emblem be heavily punished but devout will also suffer if you don‚Äôt let people get off the hook, since you have to get 10+ hooks to get the credit of a 4k, that and with the emblems expecting more out of the killer. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even worth defending hooks at all, just let then off and let then heal so you can get that $$$.
---
Nurse has a paper bag over her head
---
And they were teabagging too, lol. What a bunch of spineless, unskilled losers. 
---
lol?
---
This person just said they hurt themselves, bruising and scratching themselves, because they get enraged playing the game.
---
And i'm the asshole for telling them to stop playing the game that gets them to hurt themselves and instead seek help?
---
Yeah only the godlike players knows how to unlock this  :/
---
Honestly the degen on a good skill check isn't nearly as annoying as the temporary lockout for progression for everyone working on the gen.

Camping is boring, but some times needed. If the game is full of cheeky altruists, as in *everyone goes to unhook a guy*, then yes camp. If they‚Äôve already done a few gens and no one is coming for the survivor? Book it.
---
because they‚Äôre mad.
---
Yea Legion with no addons is pretty easy to beat but how often do you ever see that? That's not a very good argument.

I see them all the time. Luck of the draw I guess

Must be, none of them are on sale in the European store.
---
you're in despise of nasty players. not the killer. just like you said about 80%. and i completely understand that.
---
unlike Legion who has fundamental flaws in their design, Doctor doesn't. he has a strong tracking and nice loop stopping kit at his disposal but he is still counterable. i've met nasty players choosing Doctor but i've also met nasty players using any other killer. it has nothing to do with the design, the problem is players. there are plenty Billies out there just fully abusing full meta builds and scoring in game much, much more than Doctors, Freddies or any other killers.

This is also how hard they are to play against.

That separate out different paths in the abattoir. They are 4 to 5 metal bars that work as a wall.

Ok I see now. Thanks for actually being helpful. I just find his ability frustrating. The sprint feels too short for me and Franks Mixtape just ruins chases to me. It doesn't feel satisfying to win a chase with Legion and the sprint feels too short to me. I'd have preferred it if it was longer, removed the deep wound mechanic (so you have to come out of the sprint and then hit them) and make it a Mobility/utility ablitity instead.

Not hating but why use NOED and iridescents? 
---
You are the nerd 
---
The thrill of a decent chase/match. I just love looping and finding the right moment to throw down a pallet. It's so simple yet I enjoy it so much, never realized how fun running in circles could be haha. I pretty much stopped caring whether or not I escape, I just chase the thrill of a good match.
---
People DCed against a boring build? I'm shocked. 
---
NOED in that build makes me doubt you actually have an aim. 
---
Facts. The Feral Frenzy conceptually is very interesting, but what stabbing people does and its duration is just unhelpful. I still like playing Legion regardless though.
---
I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre getting downvoted lol, it‚Äôs quite a simple mistake to make. 
---
With my flashlight skill level it's better off this way
---
Do yourself a google search of masquerade bird mask and youre gonna get some images of a feathery mask and some masks that look like the doctors new outfit.
---
His chest piece and legs piece dont at all resemble a 1347 plague doctor but more of a well dressed man. 
---
My theory is pushed further with the mask only covering the upper part of his face leaving the mouth and nose free to breathe. Plague doctors wore full suits leaving none of their skin exposed and put flowers and good smelling things in their beak to try and not get sick. 
---
So no i dont consider myself an imbecile but hey you see beak and glass eyes and yell plague doctor and suggesting something something that goes against your ideas is the worst thing ever and you need to insult and downvote anyone who says otherwise.

Continuing to work on gen when it‚Äôs in the buffer stage increases chance for skill check?

True enough! just massacred by the legion today in less than 5 mins

I‚Äôd rather see a spider killer corrupted by the entity, a shark seems odd, but something like a spider would make a bit more sense. I even had a dream that I was playing as one, weird stuff. 
---
That's a yikes for me pal
---
Thank you Marv
---
Yeah so what the hell is wrong with what i said and why did you need to insult me twice now
---
I just got back into the game, that was my build before I even used the iridescent. I just jumped in to see if I could still land the hatchets and to see that I was almost prestiged and had multiple iridescent heads and infantry belts so why not?

bUt WhAt AbOuT mY NaRrAtIvE?

Nearly as bad aus Autodidact

So you dislike a character yet you still play him because you bought him? That's like eating a dogshit because you thought it was gonna be a hamburger but "i paid for it so".
---
Well id say he can be angry after that, that matchmaking fcked him. Also hes rank 20 so hes just angry at the wrong thing and didnt realise.
---
That was beautiful 
---
I‚Äôll never understand this subs hard on for generic ideas with no depth. 
---
I draw the killers however I want. Honestly it depends on how I‚Äôm feeling on the day. Some days I just want to draw cute things, others gory and messed up! Also I‚Äôm pretty bad at gore, I‚Äôm only good at drawing blood splatters, and that‚Äôs it. So cute things it is. Heh.
---
I do understand they are ruthless killers, and others do as well, but some of us just like drawing cute things. (Sorry if this became a rant sort of thing)
---
Are you saying you cant beat them unless you have a mori?

My first legion match be like

Person 2: bleeding out and knocked

Person 4: leads legion to me

Me: well feck

It's worse when you get an actual expert toxic level Claudette. That's why I'm reserved in helping bloody Claudettes until i can see if they being toxic or not. If they're really being a jerk i got aftercare to sandbag em

It's been on the Developers Wishlist for a long time to have maps with water and I think it was planned for the Swamp. But such tech takes time to make.
---
I dont really want a Shark Killer, i rather want a Diving Suit Killer with a hook canon.
---
But water in maps sure.
---
I‚Äôve had 30 minute stand offs with a killer at the hatch after they‚Äôve already killed everyone. At that point they could have played 1-2 more games. But they just had to get that last kill.

Yea it's a strategy, just frowned upon because it usually makes the game boring for everyone. Most of the time it doesn't pay off as once the other survivors realize what's happening, they just rush gens and leave with the killer only getting one killer.
---
 But that's not to say it doesn't work sometimes. I've been in games where camped and still got a 4k because we all got greedy with the unhook.

Trust me I tried
---
Ping didn't let me
---
On console, he actually used to be broken as shit because no one looped and everyone played immersed.
---
But I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs actually closer to bottom tier on PC, at least in high ranks. At least Larry has a chainsaw (not that it always does much). He‚Äôs still better than freddy because he can actually protect hooks, etc.

Do you know that when spectating, when only one survivor remains, you can keep clicking the arrow to change who you watch and it stops the killer radius sound while you watch.

Ultra-rare  Add-on: Fuming List
---
A grocery list freshly torn from the fridge. The Entity's fog spreads from it as the paper shakes in the wind.
---
If none of the following conditions are met, Fuming List will deactivate itself and no be consumed in the trial. Fuming List will be active if:
---
*A survivor uses an Ultra-rare Add-on
---
*A survivor uses a Very Rare Item.
---
*A survivor uses a map offering or a White Ward.
---
*A survivor wants to have fun.
---
If Fuming List is active, then the following affects will apply to all survivors who meet the activation requirements:
---
*Instead of being called to take out garbage, they will instead be called to help with grocery shopping, regardless of if The Mother would need help or not.
---
*Survivors who are grocery shopping will spend a TREMENDOUS amount of out the game, giving them a 1-5% chance of ever getting back into the game, depending on how close stores are and how much is needed to be bought.
---
*Removes the ability to manually use your ability on affected survivors.
---
*Your ability may be randomly used on survivors, out of your control. The chance of this increases with trial time and gens done. Tremendously increases the chance your ability to randomly use your ability while you are chasing the survivor or there is a hatch-standoff.
---
*The Mother will also leave the game when she sends someone grocery shopping. She will return faster than the affected survivor, however, becuase she won't help you with the damn groceries.

You should destroy totems, especially the lit ones. The lit ones give the killer an advantage (perk) in the game. There's one perk that punishes you for destroying lit totems (Haunted Ground) giving you the exposed state ( you go down on one hit) for 60 seconds, but it's a risk you should take anyway. And there's a perk (No One Escapes Death) that lights a random totem (only if there's at least one left) when all the generators are done, and gives you the exposed state until that lit totem is destroyed.
---
Yes

We don't. I mean there are 5000 SCPs and their names are usually just random numbers so it's quite hard. I think i can only remember around 20 without any complications.

I do enjoy when I can get a good bop from a pallet on a killer or juke them/lose them in a chase but I‚Äôm not all that good at it so it doesn‚Äôt really make me excited. I do however like doing things that ‚Äúchange the game‚Äù. There was one game that looked like we were all going to die - devour hope had just been activated, I was on the hook, someone else was getting off the hook just to be slugged. The other two were slugged. I kobed off the hook! Healed one person up, Got one person off the hook ran and got the other person off. Someone found devour hope but was hit and killed. Some one else was slugged and another person trying to get devour hope but caught and killed. (I was right on the other side of a wall as it happened) As the killer (wraith) went for the other person, or to look for me, I found the devour hope and took it out, ran and got the other person up.... I felt like the MVP of the match!!! He did find me and slug me but went for the other survivor, hooked them and gave me the hatch in the end.

And honestly, it would be fine, if this wasn't an unofficial forum that the devs don't frequent at all (I think). So it's all just pointless spam in the end.
---
I'm gunna Tom Brady your dad if your not careful with your words there pal.
---
Let‚Äôs not get rash, pal
---
Thank you! People seriously shouldn't think Legion absolutely broken at base. His power is completely useless against injured Survivors for Chrissake. 
---
If I had to choose a good add-on combo for Legion, it's Joey's and Cold Dirt. The recovery rate is fantastic for helping Feral Frenzy Segway into an easy down. 
---
You can use commas instead of the subtraction symbol
---
As killer I'll go up to rank 1 after plague release and sit around 10-5 for survivor, I've seen this all happen in pretty much every rank and it's not fun but I get downvoted for speaking the truth :)
---
&gt;Killers will now see the lobbies filled up with 4 survivors
---
instantly (regardless they are playing in SWF or solo)
---
Don't know how happy I am with that. If a killer doesn't know about this change, he will just think everyone is a SWF team and the killer quitting quote will be higher than ever before.
---
maybe he streams the game ?
---
if you're wondering why you're getting downvoted my friend, at this point you kinda showed that you just wanna complain instead of having a real discussion
---
I mean if people who literally don't shower or have any personal hygiene is "hot" thats cool I guess. Just saying, they nasty, but you do you.
---
We wait to get more
---
Interesting
---
I'd more expect the ability to kill a single black male survivor, because the black dude always dies first.
---
Now it‚Äôs at 103. I might have inspired the comeback of the ‚Äúgang memes‚Äù
---
She‚Äôs high off of flashlight battery acid
---
Isn't a killer supposed to not care about someone's well being and fun
---
üÖøÔ∏èerhaps
---
We can hope
---
I mean that's really funny but the guy is way too toxic
---
It's on a 40% sale if you want to get it for USD $1.19
---
Its not hard to find totems
---
Would RedShell also be used on consoles or is this just a PC thing?
---
‚ôìÔ∏èüÖæÔ∏èüÖøÔ∏èe
---
Nah I think I‚Äôm good
---
This is so sweet!! I‚Äôm glad (from a survivor here) that you enjoy killer so we can even have lobbies to play in and someone to play against. I agree with all your points, too. I really have only played Overwatch as an online ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù game and that can be even worse because during the match they can actually get on the mic and talk about your play style and call you trash. At least here you can choose to read or get the messages at all. 
---
And fill up the comment section if you want!! I love reading all the different views and reasons and I love stories about matches. I love watching game play from others of matches they enjoyed. I have always enjoyed watching game play from games but I really really enjoy watching DBD games the most. 
---
Spirit goes pit pat too... the erasure 
---
üÖ±Ô∏è
---
&gt;no one actually likes playing the game because whether you win or lose, you're getting angry messages.
---
Thats how competitive games work my dude. You lose, you get angry, you attack the person that won. You win, you get your ego up, you attack the person that lost.
---
I never realized how much I needed this in my life.
---
I don't think she is paralysed. Like would you also walk when you can levitate? 
---
I get both your points.  You're saying to bring the Mori to punish the toxic teabags of the 4 man but they are saying and they have a point that by bringing the mori you're essentially admitting that you're incapable of beating the team without it.  They are pretty crutch especially if you play a killer that can hard tunnel off hook effectively if they decide to play like a piece of shit with the mori like a Hag or Nurse or someone.  Personally I'd rematch them without the Mori so I could feel I earned the victory legit.  I always feel cheap using them.  I save them for dailies and prestiges basically.
---
This is what E-sports do to your mind. 
---
He shouldn‚Äôt have been camping at all
---
Jokes on you, I'm a Meg with WGLF.
---
Where is your god now?
---
It's too late she has airpods and can't hear us
---
To be fair though a Legion rework is a bit more pressing than a Freddy reword. I mean Freddy is bad compared to the other killers but is not unplayable. You can still win just takes a lot more effort and practice.
---
Legion is just bad. Without using Add-ons it's really hard to play him against a competent team.
---
I am really interested to see how BHVR plans on improving them both. I'm not expecting much change on Freddy other than maybe a base reduction to skill check chances in the dream world.
---
I‚Äôm gonna try to avoid those from now on because this sub can get extremely circlejerk-y when it comes to legion. 
---
Yeah except it's a killermain circlejerk and the braindead legionplayers are all getting upvoted. As you're proof of.
---
More blood points and allows the survivor to make sure everyone has left the game thus no one is in danger of being hooked.
---
Lol just leave that other person they‚Äôre clearly pressed for no reason 
---
Yup, playing solo survivor makes me want to kms since the team can't get gens done while I run the killer around for minutes
---
permanent ?
---
Play killer then
---
Oh I understand why, but I‚Äôm still pissed. We‚Äôve had Freddy for over a year and he hasn‚Äôt been changed at all. I know why legion is getting changed first, but Freddy has been waiting longer and I feel he deserves it. But I can‚Äôt do anything about it, so I‚Äôll just keep playing Freddy. 
---
The awkward stare is essential in every date 
---
Lmao Im on console. I can still hit them most of the time but sometimes you load in and you pray it doesnt stutter when you hear that noise.
---
I'm relatively sure it wouldn't be used on consoles. If it was a thing it would only be used on PC. Collecting data on Ps4 would require sony permission and would compromise the PS4 network security. 
---
I imagine so üòÇ
---
Super cute!
---
What use are moris if you can't even catch them in the first place
---
Besides for instasaw I've never seen anyone make any actual reasoning about hating Billy, in fact most people seem to really like facing him.
---
I think that was just a joke
---
Deja vu.
---
Haven't people already answered this exact same post made by you?
---
Also, NOED doesn't need any rework, just cleanse the totems. 
---
Pig has the potential to be infuriating to face, but usually the people who are annoying to face are also objectively playing bad so idk.
---
Eh. I would still levitate if I could :) 
---
Me too!
---
And jukes.
---
Why? So the final guy can get unhooked and get away? He doesn't have any choice if he wants to get a bit of BP.
---
This is my first post I've made on this sub, I did however comment on another thread when I first thought of the idea.
---
Not going to lie, cleansing the totems and then getting hit when the killer thinks it's going to be an insta-down is pretty funny but I feel as though this perk is as controversial (if not more so) than Decisive and I do feel as though it needs some changes.
---
3k hours in the game, and I 4k most games but I have no idea what I'm talking about apparently. This sub, dude.
---
Your fault for focusing on the unhooked person.  If you simply hit the person doing the unhook first you'll be able to get a second hit on them shortly after the unhook animation ends.  You're better off trading anyways more points and a hooked survivor is a hooked survivor.
---
And if you go against the spirit, always break totems /s
---
(She has a perk that traps 2 totems. When you break a trapped totem, she gets insta-downs for 40/50/60 seconds. Also any killer can have this perk once it‚Äôs unlocked but it starts on spirit)
---
But it doesn't help with a chase. And it doesn't regress gens. It's not an opinion. And you shouldn't spend more than 10 seconds in a whole game regressing gens. You won't have time to do that.
---
you can check steam profile or see if they look like they know each other with their nickname, outfits etc...
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt leveled my meg yet so hope is better than nothing. Especially when we miss a totem. I have no problems with noed but it‚Äôs nice to outrun it. Also hope is a speed boost for two minutes with no exhaust so dead hard or sprint burst is still viable. If your running the whole match without healing like i do hope and resilience open that door very quickly. 
---
Interesting idea
---
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song.
---
No, you should be permanently banned for life with a headshot at BHVR so they know who to arrest when they see you. 
---
Wow... Just Wow.

This one is in Edinburgh on the 6th of April :D I've never seen any other dbd cosplayers around here apart from my friend tbh

I know I guess a lot of people teabag and that absolutely calls for facecamping.
---
I do, i don't play surv just for that but if i see it then i do something
---
I remember when devs announced Legion and it was all games and fun. Who would say a character could create so much hate and salt.
---
Which very few seem to remember how to do anymore
---
Doing gens, you? 
---
I mean, it's just a perk that saves time. It tells you where survivors aren't, so that you're not wasting time looking in a place where they aren't. You're not gonna guess where they spawned the first time every single time. But like you don't need any perk on Nurse, so fair enough.
---
But it could be me, saying ‚Äúgood throw, gg‚Äù
---
Bro I play nothing but this game, I love Wraith he is my second main after Trapper, that being said he is anything but top tier man.  Don't confuse learning to play a character optimally to them being legitimitaly one of the stronger characters.  He is a lot better than he used to be but at the end of the day he is easily outclassed by so many killers in this game.
---
&gt;This is my first post I've made on this sub, I did however comment on another thread when I first thought of the idea.

&gt;Not going to lie, cleansing the totems and then getting hit when the killer thinks it's going to be an insta-down is pretty funny but I feel as though this perk is as controversial (if not more so) than Decisive and I do feel as though it needs some changes.
---
Except DS had little to no counter and NOED has two solid counters (cleansing 5 totems beforehand or 1 hex totem) with other possible scenarios where the perk is useless such as people hiding, opening the exit gate and leaving ASAP without even knowing the killer had NOED active. I personally have juked NOED killers into an escape without being downed a few times so is not an impossible task either.
---
I honestly don't understand why people complain about NOED, it is healthy for the game because without it survivors would just ignore totems every match and focus on nothing but generators. The fear of NOED takes them off generators for a totem cleansing activity and that gives killers a few seconds to breath. 
---
Trapper say "hi" T-T
---
You can just tell by their icons if theyve escaped?
---
Yeah PS4 and I did see that. Didn‚Äôt know that many people liked him.

The opposite really they've buffed several of the worst perks into the meta for both sides.  You have a lot more leeway now with perks and builds currently. 
---
Can we get some oinks in chat for Kate and Nea 
---
The change that hasn't happened yet? What a good point!
---
Oh so now survivors are okay with us running NOED?
---
&gt; Escape rates are 30 35% in all ranks
---
Are you using the stat that the devs gave us? because it's trash that didn't control for hook suicides and disconnects 
---
&gt; the game is favored for the killers unless you bite and claw your way through the games
---
the game is very well balanced EXCEPT for swf 
---
I get that, but. It's not really a big deal, in my eyes. You'll forget about this conversation once it's over, lol. Not a big deal at all. 
---
I play both equally and I find it silly to not see an issue with certain things in this game, hatch being one of them. I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to tune them but it‚Äôs willful ignorance to think the state we‚Äôre in with stand offs and hatch camping with two survs left is fine and doesn‚Äôt need any sort of change.
---
I wish that the idle animations reflected on their personality a bit better in the lobby.  Nea would assert dominance via polishing her purple flashlight and throwing some Autohaven Offerings in the fire to infinite the killer.  Dwight would be freaking out while trying to organize everyone.  Laurie would polish her knife to stab poor Freddy.  Claudette would be organizing various plants to make tinctures to heal the team.  It goes on like this, maybe Jane would be formulating a plan with others to escape the trial.
---
I used to see it as a GOJF card, but once I realized it's a consolation prize, rather than a free pass, I stopped caring about that *ONE* guy that thinks it means they've won by using it. The point of playing survivor is that you're a team, if your team gets so destroyed that in order to have just *one* person survive, you need to take it, you didn't win, you took the games equivalent of "buck up champ, maybe you'll have better luck next time!"
---
TL,DR; if they *had* to use the hatch, they've lost, it just wasn't pure destruction.
---
Care to share why you didn‚Äôt like it?
---
Or does the link not work?
---
Ah ok I‚Äôll try going for the unhooker
---
more like this need to be done. Amazing, better than maiking the killers dance
---
Yes?
---
You can prestige them
---
There are extra skins for licensed killers. If you prestige a licensed killer you get the blood variation like every other killer.
---
They don't, there are just over 10-15 that are the most popular because they are present in games..
---
Oh ok I didn‚Äôt think you would get them thanks
---
People say urban evasion is the best teachable. I say the pig has the best urban evasion, and it‚Äôs inbuilt
---
Facecamping and proxy are very different tbh. Proxy camping allows you to find the altruistic survivors facecamping just messes with everybodys score. The entity likes to see a gladiator battle.  Not somebody complete an objective. Make sense?
---
I feel you. During rank reset I change my play a little bit to help get pips and stay alive. What are you running now? If you‚Äôre solo playing maybe run Kindred to help the other know what others are doing so they know to do a gen if someone else is going for you. 
---
Maybe run Iron Will to help with hiding and not making noise. 
---
Aftercare, empathy or Bond to help with seeing others. I have found great success with aftercare. I get to be altruistic to get the connections with people and then they can see me if they need healing and usually if they are in a chase and I‚Äôm on a gen they know not to run towards me. 
---
At the beginning of the match go hide against the wall but near a gen. Don‚Äôt start it until he killer passes you or you see they are chasing someone else and then start it. Or go for totems during that time. This has greatly improved my longevity of play during rank reset time. Also remembering to always assume bitter murmur after a gen is finished or BBQ or Rancor when someone is hooked. 
---
Stay strong! 
---
eh, still would
---
If the mask isn't available for Iridescent I swear to god 
---
# I will be rustled to fucking heck
---
It's the only way to get alternate skins for licensed killers. They all have bloody variants
---
Is this on console? Just turn off messages so you won‚Äôt get hate
---
You have to double return the sentence to make it break, I think. 
---
Honestly with how this sub is, the /s is really needed.
---
*Megalovania starts*
---
WGLF increases all of your BP by the amount given by perk level post-trial. Not just altruism!
---
Face Camping 101, what Not to do....
---
Poor guy just wanted one kill
---
Still not a reason to camp boys and girls
---
If you're a survivor and you get downed after the gates are open, you can assume you're getting sacrificed. The killer doesn't "owe you" anything. 
---
I'd say Billy is a great killer to begin with.  The instadown is always a threat but even if you struggle with aiming those downs on survivors his ability is just incredibly useful for zooming across map from gen to gen and keeping up pressure.  Also weaker survivors will toss pallets early because of his saw.  A good test for this to both gauge the skill of each survivor individually as well as quickly clear pallets is to begin revving your saw as they approach the pallet.  If they're weak they'll stand there and toss it allowing you to quickly shred through pallets.  If they're strong they'll continue looping the pallet and you've identified a survivor that is more prepared to handle you compared to their teamates.  
---
Fuck those shit face campers  
---
BUt GAteS OpEn MaNN  
---
That's what I do now but my problem with playing killer is more than hatemail. It just feels like hardwork that isn't worth it most of the time. Killers are just there to provide a minor thrill to survivors, it's not that fun to actually play. 
---
&gt; because the killer can patrol the 3 remaining gens.
---
Not if you do your gens smart. Don't rush gens on one side of the map
---
I've seen enough porn to know where this is going to XD
---
That's been like half the posts and comments and it's just getting stale now
---
Thank you. And I didn't even notice myself, but now that I look at it yeah it does look like don't starve. Thank you again
---
Killer cooperating with the survivors to farm BP is the exact opposite of honest work.
---
I don't mind when it happens, though.
---
Yep
---
damn you got a p3 at level 62
---
Holy hell this is sick !
---
Yes I have amazing observational skills. Anyways, even if it‚Äôs not the case I could make the argument that it‚Äôs someone that has done no wrong but do gens either. It‚Äôs still a very scummy thing to do.
---
You may be apathetic and say it's not a big deal to you, which is totally understandable cause you didn't make the video and are just a dude on the internet. 
---
But it's a deal to the person did spend time and effort to make the video and who didn't get all the views this post received because OP cut the video and posted it with the reddit video player when he could have easily copy/pasted the YouTube link.
---
Omg 
---
He is joking my dude
---
Oh ok I didn‚Äôt think you could get any 
---
I don‚Äôt watch him on twitch but these clips I‚Äôve been seeing of him really make me glad I haven‚Äôt wasted my time in his stream. I don‚Äôt want to have an opinion on him but  after having my husband play on my account last night (he only played a few games last year and then didn‚Äôt touch it again) and he played killer, I was I Was trying to give him tips and helping him navigate the abilities and where to look and what to do. There was one game that it seemed like he was getting a little bullied and I messaged them letting them know he was very new to the game and we are over here laughing about it all. They said gg at the end and my husband was chill about it and kept on going. I would hope they wouldn‚Äôt say the game was ‚Äúboring‚Äù  because for him I was actually challenging. 
---
I guess I just don‚Äôt understand how always being so negative about he game and gameplay of others constitutes being a fog whisperer. I mean, I guess the entity likes that kind of chaos but me as a watcher, I don‚Äôt like it at all. I have seen this not only from clips from him but other streamers that are also fog whisperers. I know viewer count/subscriptions come into play as well but there are genuinely nice people streaming out there hat would deserve it more. 
---
Being a nerd isn‚Äôt good and to have a game where people all survive and you make an unhook and get both of you away shouldn‚Äôt be called an  ‚Äúboring game‚Äù. That killer probably had a very hard time and probably didn‚Äôt find it boring at all. Instead he should be using his influence to help give them constructive criticism and genuine tips and help to make games easier/better/LESS BORING. Being like that doesn‚Äôt help the game.  
---
The second they learn the whole look at the ground/look away to break the chase whilst making u bleed out Legion becomes much stronger imho, it's also tilting as fuck to play against because he/she can run after you whilst this is happening. Or even if they dont abuse this and just make you waste time by trying to mend (I never heal against them it's not worth it imo, esp if they running sloppy butcher etc), the killer turns from bottom tier to high/mid tier. So meh simply because of my (admittedly) harsh bias I hope legions stay off console for your sake.
---
Anyways this is going nowhere, I was trying to be as civil as I could so I‚Äôm sorry if I offended any of you killer mains or toxic players.
---
doo doo doo doo... doo doo doodoodoodoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doodoodoo
---
To be fair, this users were Bette than mine
---
That's a fair point. I mean, I'll take my 4K as much as the next Killer, but it isn't crucial to a good time or anything. The hatch standoff is unbearably boring. The only time I actually care is if I'm going for an Adept achievement, but otherwise I really don't. 
---
Can you use the new DS on Xbox one? I haven‚Äôt seen any update options.
---
Also thanks for confirmation of the flapping = killer is too close/there‚Äôs a trap. I thought of that on my own and it pissed a camper off, so I thought I must be right. 
---
Another motion I do when hooked is grab the rope. To me, this means ‚Äúhe‚Äôs nowhere near me, please help if you can!‚Äù (I have a useful ability that lets me know where the killer is often - some hook and run and I want others to know this) People usually come running. They may just think I‚Äôm trying to suicide though. But I don‚Äôt let the bar fill up so it never counts as an escape attempt. In generally, it‚Äôs harder for them to wait until it‚Äôs safe or let me die than to unhook.
---
In some terrain, I can hide after being unhooked, but if we are wide open, it‚Äôs tougher. 
---
Also on possibly farming teammates: pointing. I point at safe areas to go heal up (places I feel safe healing them) and at generators. One Meg pointed at the house where the killer was. Which of us has it backwards? To me, point = go there! I ran in the opposite direction she pointed but she kept pointing at the house, not moving much. One guy saw her while I was doing a gen and ran in the house after she pointed at it for him. She ignored the generator I was working on nearby. (Her rank was 15, same as mine.) I didn‚Äôt even know we could point until I read about it here. It‚Äôs great for generator help if someone‚Äôs nearby doing nothing.
---
I mean, he had to camp (don¬¥t get me wrong, camping is boring) but the exit was open. So what should he do? (This is for all players who said "camping is sh\*t etc. pp)
---
Nice save tho! You guys were randoms right?
---
I hope he doesn‚Äôt venture to console too much aswell, but I sort of like this sale going on, man it‚Äôs refreshing to go against killers I thought I‚Äôd never see again (Freddy, The Pig, The Clown, Legion).

There‚Äôs only one thing I want the devs to copy from Friday the 13th. Bots. Yes, they‚Äôre not difficult. However, knowing I can just play as Jason and have fun for two or three games is nice. For fairness, I don‚Äôt think you should be able earn bp from it.  
---
It would also be nice to just practice with other killers.
---
Hmm... I guess I‚Äôll have to level up my wraith and my bubba. Thanks
---
That is one of he worst things when someone doesn‚Äôt recover. WHY! why just lay there and not recover?? I have gone over to some and they haven‚Äôt even started but they were laying there for maybe 10 seconds as I as getting to them and avoided being caught by the killer yet no progress. And then by the time I get them to where they could have gotten themselves to anyway, the killer comes back!
---
Shakes my head
---
I was in a chase with a huntress for five minutes while the last generator was to be done and I had adrenaline. It did not get popped, because the Claudette was gen tapping and blowing up the gen while hiding in a bush afterwards each time. The huntress knew this and brought me to the hatch.
---
Lightborn is a Billy perk.  You're thinking of Shadowborn.

basement gang (leatherface) rise up
---
Where‚Äôs his DC? 
---
&gt; You're not gonna guess where they spawned the first time every single time.
---
I'd say i can 2 blink to a survivor after loading to a match 80-90% of the time. This game isn't as random as the devs would like you to believe.
---
&gt; you don't need any perk on Nurse, so fair enough
---
True enough, i've played many seasons without perks just fine. Currently BBQ &amp; Nurse's have a permanent spot in my build, they just make things faster (+ bloodpoints yay :D), the other two perks i use are whatever i feel like using.
---
Ah thats too bad. Great drawing though.
---
That‚Äôs really interesting because I honestly feel like playing survivors is way more difficult. I rarely play killer because I like playing the game with friends but when I do it‚Äôs so much easier to feel satisfied 
---
Top that off with last second purple flashlight switch
---
This is such a cute artstyle I love it! Keep up the good work! 
---
Noed is fine how it is. There is a huge counterplay to it. Stop being lazy and Just cleanse all the totems and noed won't activate. The problem is lazy survivors wanting to gen rush. That's the problem.  
---
Thank you!
---
The idea is you're suppose to fear the killer lol
---
Offerings should be burnt as soon as you move ingame
---
As I said in another response, I'm honestly not affected by it very often, either I just leave when I see someone get instadowned or NOED never hits the field because I cleanse every dull totem I see.
---
Yeah, uh, what the fuck
---
I usually assume the latter. Especially when they say "I was bored so I drew this..."
---
If everyone brought Bloody Party Streamers, you bet I‚Äôm gonna message the killer to F A R M
---
I agree with this completely Prestige should allow you to add blood to any of the cosmetics for the related slot.
---
Not on her default outfit
---
I don't see your comment contributions to anything than. What needs to be fixed it the hatch and the end game rules. Needs to be a option to close the hatch. Needs to be a timer that once the gates are open for a certain time survivor auras are revealed for the entire game and the entity blocks to gate for the entire game. This would force toxic survivors to not fast vault constantly and wait for 10 mins to get my attention so I can get teabagged before they escape. I experienced this but I assume the teabagging would happen because I do the same thing as survivor lol. 
---
I like the idea of a astronaut themed killer, maybe something less scifi to match the themes of DBD, maybe instead he could be a modern astronaut who murdered the crew of a space station.
---
Great work on the lightning! This is a great piece!
---
Now I want a Feng head cosmetic with some sick shades... 
---
There is no way you 2 blink to a survivor 90% of the matches. What the fuck. Yes, there are spawn points. I know the game. But even if you guess the first time correctly, 2 blinks isn't even far enough to get to where you wanna go unless it's a small map. Especially without whispers, you won't guess correctly in 2 blinks 90% of the time.
---
The only change i would like is a posibility to know if the totems have been cleansed or not.
---
Like a thunder roar for every cleanse, or the killer screaming map wide.
---
Currently it's just impossible to know for solo play.
---
The problem is it feels terrible because what did they do to deserve it? Great you got 2/5 the gens you needed but you get out because the killer doesn't feel like slugging. You don't deserve to get out because the killer did well.
---
I think almost everyone thats not "entitled survivor main give me my free hatch" agrees that the hatch in its current state has needed rework for a long time. That said i dont think the solution is letting the killer close the hatch and it definitely isnt removing the hatch entirely. Im not sure anything needs to be done to the *requirements* of the hatch. I think getting 2 gens before dying proves at least someone on the team was trying and getting things done and ive gotten multiple wins with 4-5 gens. The only thing that really needs to be fixed is the hatch standoff because any mechanic that stagnates the game progression until one side or the other left clicks is both ridiculous and immersion breaking. While i personally would never hang in a standoff for longer than a few minutes ive seen some with my friends go in excess of an hour of literally just standing and doing nothing for the sake of winning.
---
Yeah, but the mori tilts them, so it's worth it regardless of the killer's skill. 
---
I still want a slender man killer 
---
That's probably one of the worst things I've read this week
---
So how do you counter him?
---
New patch will fix this all tiers affect all survivors lol
---
Oof.
---
Freddy is the least fun to play against for me 
---
And pig is fun af to play as and against for me
---
Spirit and nurse too tbh, any killer that keeps me on my toes without being fucking invisible 
---
The one furthest to the left
---
Prestige 5
---
As killer main, finding the hatch is exciting. The issue is once I find it, there‚Äôs the waiting game. Perhaps if I could close it for 20 seconds, that would be cool.
---
From a killer/survivor‚Äôs perspective, the hatch is better than dc, which is what any last man with no chance is going to do.
---
Last, I saw concerns over ‚Äúpotato‚Äù survivors not doing anything and getting the hatch. Although them not doing anything will reflect in their BP, the deva could make it a requirement to finish one gen personally in order to use the hatch. The mechanic would be that survivors would retrieve a ‚Äúbattery‚Äù from the gen to use on the hatch. The hatch door will be closed but still make a sound and have the smoke coming out, and the battery would be used to open said door.
---
Cleansing totems, you?
---
What the fuck.
---
nah, the men are men, the women are men, the children, of course, men.
---
Should've added: on maps that allow it, sorry. 
---
Which is still most maps.
---
Yeah that'd be nice, I doubt they'd go back and change it, plus I wouldn't mind having something to work towards on jeff, instead of just random stuff on a level 50 web
---
At first glance it looked like it was cutting into you lol
---
**Object Of Obsession** is a very powerful perk. If you are good at the game, you usually want to be the one being chased anyway. Object allows you to start chases off with a serious distance advantage, and it provides you with copious amounts of all kinds of valuable information, more or less at-will.
---
**Resilience** and **Spine Chill** used to be my flavour, combining to increase window vault speed by 15%. You'd heal to 99% to make use of Resilience on various actions without really suffering the risks usually associated with being injured. Currently they don't affect vaulting anymore, unfortunately. While Resilience is just not worth it anymore, Spine Chill is still usable, since it gives you an early alert on whether a killer is committing to coming for you, allowing you to make good distance, and being especially neat against Nurse and Spirit and stealthy killers. It is also the only way you can increase your skill check chances on vanilla heals, and so it's a neat pair-up with Autodidact.
---
**Vigil** is another perk I used to really like running, pre-Exhaustion changes, and while it's not nearly as powerful as it was back then, it's not completely dead now, either: pair it with Sprint Burst and trigger SB whenever not in chase (so even if you are sitting on a gen) - the goal is to have Exhaustion already recovered somewhat when you do get chased, so that utilizing walking/standing/letting go of shift whenever possible will let you consistently use SB mid-chase.
---
**Dance With Me** and **Quick &amp; Quiet** are great perks if you practice your stealth-juking skills. They are notable mentions because they are particularly good assets against Nurse and Spirit, i. e. the killers you are most reliant on perks to kite, due to them not having very reliable basic counterplay. The obvious partners for these two are Iron Will and Lithe.
---
**Kindred**. In solo-queue/without communication, anything that grants survivors higher levels of coordination is really very valuable. Pair with Open-Handed and Bond to further that same notion. The issue with this combination is that all too often, random survivors are just too bad to make good use of the information they are provided with, and using Bond can be... demotivating, constantly letting you see all the bad decisions and plays fellow survivors tend to make (such as barely repairing generators). Windows Of Opportunity benefits from Open-Handed, as well, and can therefore be the perk to help your chase game, in this build. Usually I use Small Game with this however, helping quickly get rid of the Hex perks random survivors so struggle with.
---
**Plunderer's Instinct** and **Ace in the Hole** are not underrated, strictly, but they are now pretty solidly A-tier perks, in my mind, and not everyone might take them for it. Giving two perk slots for the abilities you gain through items and their add-ons is worth it, now that the chances to loot good stuff have been increased globally, thus making Plunderer's even more likely to yield better items (though in the PTB, I kind of got the feeling that BHVR have reverted the global loot buff again - intentionally or, as so often, accidentally). And not only do the items help in the rounds you looted them during, but obviously they bolster your inventory and allow you to more often bring in some of the rarer items, then spending those slots on other perks, of course.
---
**Pharmacy** is nice now that healing via Self-Care takes so mind-numbingly long. Stocking up on Emergency Med-Kits is always good, and pair Pharmacy up with Botany Knowledge and potentially even Ace in the Hole and you get multiple heals out of it, as well as the occasional Styptic.
---
As for killer perks, I want to say **Knock Out** and **Hex: The Third Seal**, but hard-slugging is so boring for survivors I don't too often like to do it. It is a lot more effective than people give it credit for, though. **Play With Your Food** is not as awful as you might hear. It's actually A-tier-ish, on Wraith, and does well enough on other killers, particularly Leatherface, counteracting the drawback of the chainsaw's slow movement speed, both while revving and attacking. It's certainly better than Thanatophobia, a (non-)perk surprisingly commonly used. PWYF pairs well with Save The Best For Last, another perk that could be called, if not underrated, at least underused. **Hex: Thrill Of The Hunt** is not just useful in specialized builds, it can have fine general utility when paired with the usual Hex: Ruin: it guarantees your Ruin does not get broken too early in the game, giving you consistently more value out of it; it leads to survivors regularly spending time cleansing dull totems as well as pressuring your Hexes (and usually even after Ruin is gone), off of which you can capitalize; it provides basic tracking utility, alerting you to survivor locations - due to which it can be a replacement for Barbecue &amp; Chili, a perk that has a variety of counters now (and TOTH even gives you a few more Bloodpoints, as well!). A perk that I don't actively use but that can be surprisingly effective especially against better survivors, is **Unrelenting**. The trick with this perk is to swing early on pallet loops, tricking the survivor into thinking they can get another loop, but thanks to your increased recovery speed, they cannot, leading to free hits. That doesn't make it a good perk, but it does mean it has any value whatsoever, when generally, it is (rightfully) taken to be a non-perk.
---
Especially since they're just cheating it.
---
down the other survivors. He's Leatherface with all 4 survivors around him and he can't capitalize on it. I understand the argument securing your kill once gates are opened, but he could've gotten a lot more done with everyone around him and him choosing to just stand there blankly revving a chainsaw only to fuck up when he does use it.
---
Honestly my only issue with Ruin is the gen stall. I feel like it should either be the regression or the stall, not both. 5% is 4 seconds + the stall which ends up being too long if RNGesus decides to give you 3 skill checks in under 10 seconds which happens a lot. Yes, you can hit the great skill checks but to expect 100% is a bit ridiculous. The worst part is that \*during the gen stall, you can still get another skill check.\* Though an entirely separate issue, if someone blows a skillcheck and you land a great check during the stall, no progress is rewarded... which is bullshit.
---
Be aware that the blood on the prestige pig clothes is almost invisible 
---
I just met a claudette who was jumping forward like 5 meters at a time, I don't know if it was hacks or just lag but it was suspicious. They had green ping in the lobby.
---
Your killer skill bracket is probably lower than it should be since you don't play it much.
---
‚Äúgg‚Äù
---
When did she eat human flesh? I thought she was just tortured by the cannibals 
---
It's not the Pig I hate, it's my potato teammates that pop the gen before I get to the first puzzle box.
---
\^\^ np, thx for creating content of this game
---
Pointing can be anything, there's no rule I know of for it yet. You're both using it to try and communicate, it just sounds like there was confusion.
---
If you want heals, do the other "come here" action and run away to safety. They won't always follow, but it might be easier to understand than pointing and running. 
---
Just remember: never EVER heal at hook. The killer is definitely coming back. Go hide first.
---
Also the server work could have been outsourced
---
It's because you're playing with inexperienced survivors. Survivor is more casual 
---
Will the killer be able to transform into only one survivor?
---
Greatest prank is to run thrill of the hunt and no other perk because then they‚Äôll run around and be terrified that you have another totem hidden. 
---
I sometimes defend my thrill sometimes to really sell it
---
High ranked SWFs alone are overpowered. The ability to communicate as survivors is huge and already puts the killer at a disadvantage. 
---
Being able to tell your team which generator is almost done, what direction the killer went, who is going for the save, etc. nullifies a large chunk of the challenge that can come with playing as survivor. That's why I wish there were solo queue options or some kind casual vs competitive lobbies. I understand why there's not, but still doesn't change the fact SWF is a skill crutch.
---
They're not bad maps by any stretch, in fact quite the opposite, but im a really big fan of variety. Thanks for the advice though
---
The key is part of the game like it or not
---
When u 360 legion but feral frenzy has like no attack cooldown
---
Would be nice but they don‚Äôt want to clutter the hud anymore
---
Yea  because you *really* need to feel better about losing
---
I‚Äôm a ps4 player. There are quite a few nurses Billy‚Äôs and leather-faces lurking in the low ranks that constantly wipe a team before two gens. 
---
But SWFs are already overpowered, so really it's just leveling the playing field. 
---
I looove dark sense. wont play a match without running it. super helpful if you're a gen jockey. if you're more the altruistic type, or run the killer around type, use alert.
---
Time to bam-bam-bambo-bam, get em
---
I like him until the final 3 gens. If he planned them out and left them close, he's frustrating how quickly he can get back and forth. 
---
Thank you!! I'd love to draw all the killers at some point üòä
---
Yeah, to be honest spirit was my hardest decision, i would really have liked to uprank her (she is my boyfriends favorite) but i just... don't find her beautiful or sexy, am sorry :(
---
Is the extra 500 points really worth it though. Let's be honest killers camp at the end so they can feel better about losing
---
Yeah. But I may be biased because I like the pig better, but you may be right
---
It‚Äôs aight. Not everyone has the same opinion. 
---
I agree with that which is why I included that in the first part of my post.  Holy shit there's a lot of downvoting baby killers out today lol.  I was attempting to be objective but you guys can downvote me all day while you throw on that mori and noed for the swf you aren't good enough to beat lol.
---
I‚Äôm a ps4 player. There are quite a few Billy‚Äôs nurses and leather faces that lurk there in the low ranks and successfully achieve a 4K before the first two gens
---
When playing against a toxic swf, you just have to change your play style.  Swfs will always hook swarm to save their friends, especially once the exit gates are opened; it's why they hate camping and legion so much.  
---
Legion's frenzy is really good at punishing that.  You can inflict deep wounds on all of them, stab again to end it.  You can mad grit anyone dumb enough to body block.  They will be able to unhook but you can down another one to replace them.  Everyone goes away to mend then you repeat if they come back. 
---
Huntress is really good for this sort of thing, especially if you've hooked right by a locker.
---
Too many people take camping and tea bagging so personally.  The antagonistic nature of the game has created sore winners and losers.  I play both killer and survivor equally, achieving red rank status on both, only rank one killer.
---
As a solo survivor, I get killed A LOT but I usually get enough points to pip.  Survivors don't have to escape to win nor do killers have to 4k.  Tbh, I've encountered more toxic survivors while playing a survivor.  As a solo, other survivors are competing against you; getting farmed happens all of the time.  It's just the nature of the game.  Swf, drastically ups your chance to survive. 
---
As a killer, it's amusing when survivors help you or farm their teammates.  It makes sense to target the one you just hooked but I make a point to target them first.  I get it having played only solo survivor but you should at least try to help your team.  
---
There are a lot of two and three person Swfs and if they are toxic, the game is sullied not just for the killer but for the solos as well. 
---
‚ÄúRare‚Äù
---
This post was made by Amanda gang
---
Yeah it only happens to me when I‚Äôm not in a full squad. Sometimes it‚Äôs only me and one other person. That‚Äôs the times it feels like the other two just can‚Äôt make a good decision. And it sucks but that‚Äôs the down side of not having a full team.  
---
Best ones in my opinion are the shape, and the cannibal
---
An ebony mori doesn't level shit lol.  Come on dude...swf teams are extremely beatable I 4k against them regularly.  They tend to play overly altruistic and can give you games at the end even when things look rough because of this.  Ebony moris take zero skill to win with man I personally just feel bad about using them.  I think games should be fun and competitive for both sides and I extend this to swf teams I face.  Nothing more satisfying then taking their smug asses down.  It feels good knowing I don't resort to crutching to make this happen.
---
Activate *LOBBY DODGE*
---
The hilarious part is when someone who was farming as Leatherface all game goes ahead and insta-downs the whole group and proceeds to hook them all.
---
Huntress is my all-time favourite killer to play against, personally. She's strong, but fair, and dodging hatchets is a constant exciting factor. She's the best designed killer in the game for both survivors and the killer playing her, imo. 
---
Alert is better but I wouldn‚Äôt use of those
---
its extremely necessary and effective for early game Trapper.
---
the time it takes me to find/collect all my traps and set them in place plays a role in how my mid game will go. I dont care if Ruin lasts me 45 seconds. those are 45 seconds I didnt have anyone on gens, and could set my traps.
---
then once it's been cleansed, I'll get the game going. I'll herd survivors to my traps, and patrol gens.
---
(Sorry if this has been done before!)
---
Sorry, I ate dinner, Ill get it right away!
---
Sounds fun, I'd definitely play that
---
this. 3 gens went off almost simultaneously while I was setting traps with Ruin. never again.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely try this out.
---
Its always haunted ground anyway
---
oÕôÃ†iÃÇÕóÃ≥ÕßÃüÃénÕúÃ©ÕúÃüÃÇÃøÕÜk
---
Thanks
---
What else can the killer do? He moves away from the hook, he just escapes.
---
Gonna be honest and hit you with an oof
---
Kind of thw oposite happened to me. I was doctor with ebony mori. I was planning on only using my mori when survivors were on death hook, but every time I was about to grab a survivor, they DC'd. 2 generators were done and the 3th person DC'd, suddenly I got a lot of loud noise notirications somewhere, I went over and saw a T-bagging survivor, they ran away, I followed, saw them jumping and I grabbed them last moment.
---
Next match I come across same people, I did not equip an ebony mori, proceeded to get another 4k
---
trapper spirit hag billy nurse
---
hillbilly/nurse?
---
freddy has a good stall and pressue with the class photo add-on but his mobility sucks
---
it really isn't especially on killers that already have good pressue
---
The game usually spawn me out in the open with the killer on the opposite end of the map looking at the killer and with no walls or loops nearby... yeah.
---
Yeah but like i said in my post the randoms are too alruistic and all three of them rush the hook. I even put on kindred so they can see each other while am being hooked and camped so they can all do gens but nah not a brain cell between them. 
---
My connection and ping is always green.
---
Feels bad man. 
---
I don't really mind the concept behind the killers. It doesn't matter to me if they are unique or not as long as they are fun and healthy for the game.
---
I'm tellin' ya "fellow gamer legends", watch Farmer John on Y/T. If ya love Noob&lt;3..you will most likely like this well hydrated legend. Sub to Pewds
---
I would disagree with trapper. Yes he has traps but they aren‚Äôt very effective considering how small their hit boxes are, and how survivors can walk around them if they see them. 
---
Juked him like a jukebox. He could have camped you, but surprisingly he didn‚Äôt.
---
Hmmmm yes you forgot the deleted
---
for fun. i do the same thing on my main, but o hide my hours so people don‚Äôt think i have more hours than i really do. on my smurf, i just boost hours to get higher in the ladder of top hours played :P
---
Pig Main Gang Big Brain 
---
Right now sadly i just prestiged my only survivor ive levelled before the season reset haha. I am new after all. I run kindred to help the survivors see me. I run DS. I also run dance with me and self care.

Building my Auric Cells up. #Grindin'4thePlague
---
I was the entity!
---
Hillbilly has by far the greatest pressure with his chainsaw. Nurse is good too for pressure, especially if you use the range increasing add ons 
---
&gt; Playing killer isn't worth the headache.
---
Main reason why I quit a while back. I ain't got the time or patience to deal with 4 man tryhard SWF squads. 
---
I get it, people need to play with their friends, but this game wasn't designed around survivors having open communication with each other in a match. It's one of those design flaws that we have to live with.
---
legion if you want every survivor ever to complain about you
---
spirit if you wanna give them the scare
---
pig if you wanna have some sadistic fun
---
myers if youre really into dbdgonewild
---
I can get behind this, would be that dirty secret inside the company! MCote does a evil laugh as he pressed the execute button on the new match making system! 
---
I‚Äôm j/k though since I know this will probably get some people‚Äôs balls twisted.    
---
The issue is they still haven't done anythint about it
---
I hope your headphones were cranked. You most likely would have had blood coming out of your ears.
---
On slow killers like trapper it makes sense, but I don‚Äôt get on nurse and billy ? They have insane map pressure already combined with bbq&amp;chili 
---
i main spirit when im at home, and i rlly want pig for those gen grabs but idk and legion just,, disgusts me.
---
your\*
---
Ok? That doesn't mean the same thing as romanticizing serial killers lol. Yea you can like both, separately. Together is slightly deranged.

You are such a comedian. I can‚Äôt stop laughing.

Try to get someone and accept you played like shit
---
haha, omg I love you.
---
Omg
---
I agree ebony mori is very powerful and takes very little effort, but it still doesn't change the fact SWF removes a huge chunk of the inherent challenge that comes with playing survivor. 
---
Epic Gamer: "Are we getting a Plague Doctor Killer?" 
---
BHVR Studios(Dressed as a Pirate): "Well Yes, but Actually No."
---
Except survivors are either gonna stay still in front of the exit gate or wait till you leave the hooked person to unhook them. So you do yourself no favor with that.
---
all you shittalking a plague doctor idea i hate you all
---
This debate is like Superman vs One Punch man 
---
Superman is Godly but One Punch man is literally so powerful he is a joke
---
I'm pretty sure pig cant grab decent survivors because of the uncrouch animation, jsyk
---
Well thank you, you're also just great
---
Bubba got fans. 
---
well im on xbox where im buying these and im rank 10 so 
---
No. You don't need Ruin to do well. 
---
Idk, maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm a low rank or I‚Äôm on pc or something but my interactions with survivors are usually pretty nice. Sometimes you get assholes but most of the time I get people who ‚Äúgg‚Äù or talk to me post game about the things that happened during the game like ‚Äúoh man! Your pig is scary. I screamed when you pulled me off the gen!‚Äù Or ‚Äúyeah, huntresses hatchet are really hard to use, just gotta keep practicing‚Äù. Like, usually just nice stuff. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôm playing a whole different game from you guys, but I never really understood the whole ‚Äúomg yeah survivors are so toxic to killers‚Äù. 
---
Why would you as a killer give survivors the chance to escape? Your objective is literally to kill people. It's fine if that's how you want to play, but do not call other killers toxic for doing that. 
---
yeaaa when I prestiged Billy, I never used Ruin. much better perks for him than that. hah
---
Well he does have crazy source video maker hours as well. He probably is some sort of content creator.
---
I had games like this too where we only found ruin when there was one gen left. I‚Äôll be the gen jockie if I see nobody doing anything but running around a map to find a totem. Honestly unless I spawn with it, I never find it until I‚Äôm being chased. 
---
I agree
---
Oink. 
---
That's up to you as a player.
---
Usually I just focus on the person I've started hitting until I down them. It's not too hard to hit them four times; no matter how good they are they can't avoid a Killer who can fast vault windows and pallets for very long (unless I mess up). A lot of newer Survivors also underestimate bloodlust and/or mess up loops against Legion and let me quickly down them without Feral Frenzy.
---
If I get lucky and face a bunch of people in a small area I'll try to smack them all before going back to look for the first person; usually they'll just start mending as soon as you leave, giving you an easy down since their mend timer has probably gone down to almost nothing and they likely aren't too close to any good loops.
---
Of course I also have to take my perks and add-ons into consideration, but that's the gist of how I play basic Legion.
---
No One Left Behind is dogshit, swap it out for Adrenaline IMO. 
---
But if he hadn't fucked up he would have downed someone...
---
when they escape your trap by themselves you added literally zero pressure. 
---
I would like this change, but honestly I think Behavior is just reluctant to make anything related to DC's easier on survivors, in case people start intentionally playing with 3 survivors because it's in some way easier.
---
It's the same reason the Bot AI you get in Counter Strike if a teammate disconnects sucks, and only listens to commands *sometimes*. They want to be very careful about people intentionally abusing something that is meant as a handicap.
---
I'm not saying 7 gens on the map and 3 survivors would be easier than a normal trial, just that you have to be very careful when creating handicaps or players *will* find a way to abuse them.
---
Hiding in lockers, you? 
---
Then I apologise for the mistake! I didn‚Äôt mean anything bad for the creator by posting the video
---
For Wraith his stealth is the equivalent of Solid Snake bringing a rocket launcher into a sneaking mission. His loud ass bell, the fact he has some cruddy predator looking ass stealth effect and the fact he makes tons of other noises when cloaked makes him the shittiest in terms of stealth to me. I'm sure even Pig can do it a little better.
---
Myers can be really spooky too. I love them jumpscare moments more than anything lol.
---
So why even pipe up that the devs haven‚Äôt been creative when you don‚Äôt care about concept? 
---
The whole point of my comment was that people just want to look like a plague doctor and meme about leeches which is a boring an uninspired concept. 
---
&gt; not like i lose anything from doing it
---
I don't really see you gaining anything either, but you do you. It's a shame though, that sort of a ladder would be fun to check out if it wasn't full of cheaters.
---
You should have just done the last generator
---
I can't speak for the others but I bought Spirit recently and oh boy, I don't care if I lose most of my games (because I haven't leveled her) because she's just so fun?? She's amazing to play mindgames with loopers because you can use her ability to make people think you're gonna break the pallet, when in reality you're jumpscarin' em from the other side. She also helped me get better at hunting and locating survivors!
---
If someone sets this up right it‚Äôll look like that porn meme
---
Heavily agree with this, would be nice to see variants of all of the killers clothing items from each movie, just so it can be different, i don‚Äôt even care if I have to use shards or auric points, just want to pimp out some of my killers like my survivors
---
Most people have gotten over the Disguise Killer thing. It's something for another time.
---
downvoting because of DS
---
a survivor with a key and DS is worse
---
Just to  clearify my comment from before, i meant the problem with self-esteem because you say micheal myers isn't hot and your name is micheal, it shouldnt be an insult
---
Yeah, it's a stupid term. People just don't wanna admit when a Killer is doing their job well. 
---
I'm looking forward to destroying the killer with my locker perk and get one shot by killers with iron maiden build xD
---
The problem is if you are the last one left and you do gens 1 of two things are going to happen. 1: He finds you and you can't find the hatch in time or he camps the hatch you do the last gen and then get NOED-ed. If this ever comes up.
---
I like it! 
---
I‚Äôm on it
---
I can't explain it, i know it's been around since forever and it's by far not only this subreddit that's doing things like that. I love anti-heroes and "evil" characters redeeming themselves in some form or another, that's what makes me like artworks like these.
---
Even tough, this wouldn't be better than playing with a full group, it's more like damage control
---
No, but the goal of Killer is to sacrifice all the Survivors. When the gates are open and a Killer has someone on the hook, why guard the hooked person? It's the best place to be. You either get the sacrifice, or you get altruistic Survivors that try to unhook which can lead to you putting another person into a dying state or even interrupting the unhook with a grab. It makes sense to camp the hook when the gates are open. 
---
No, Survivors just feel entitled to the win once all gens are done. The Killer doesn't lose once the gates are powered. 
---
Not necessary, unless you‚Äôre trapper, just very useful 
---
360 him and lead em to a pallet, he either runs so fast that's it's easy to slam him or his Frenzy will be over and the afterburn can ruin the game for you at the wrong moment
---
Oink! 
---
*found the person who doesn't play Killer*
---
It makes sense, however since it is tied to the Franchise of the actual movie, there would be less profit for the studio because you would most likely have to give a "cut" to the Movie Franchise..plus lawyers to negotiate ..etc. That is why Michael (My Main) has no skins...etc.
---
Because the correct answer is a rework. The games mechanics are too simple to do anything but rework legion‚Äôs power at this point. Because the only other plausible options are nerfing legion around the things that make moonwalking possible: walking backwards, looking up or down and the survivor being close by.

You can‚Äôt prohibit legion from looking up or down cause that‚Äôs the mechanic of the game. And if you pause or stop the timer of DW in the terror radius people who don‚Äôt moonwalk get dicked on for no reason. Legion is perfectly imbalanced. They are so volitly teetering on broken and weak that the only real solution is to change their power from the ground up, and that comes with a steep repercussion cause they have to, essentially, make a new killer. Which sucks cause I love Legion and wish people couldn‚Äôt moonwalk but also have some way to more reliably down people. 
---
No. She does not have map pressure. Her map pressure is dependent on RNG. That isn‚Äôt map pressure. 
---
Ambush doesn‚Äôt counter pallet looping if a good survivor knows where the other pallets are. 
---
Most maps don‚Äôt allow you to stand up, and ‚Äúget a free hit‚Äù before they hit the next pallet. 
---
also, anybody with a brain who sees you standing up after every bait will stay at the pallet.

Idk man, as someone who plays both at red ranks, playing killer is stressful cause you have to be on it for 100% of the match and even then if you‚Äôre playing against a good swf you can end up not pipping. As a survivour, even if you‚Äôre up against a really good 3 blink nurse, or something, you at least can chill out whilst other people are being chased and whatever. 
---
Kartoffeln. 
---
Stop doing that.   
---
I don't get you people. (YOU PEOPLE!?) So many people in this game have this dumb honor system. I see it mainly with Killers. Killers who say they always give the hatch to the last survivors and shit like that. Killers shouldn't be doing that kind of stuff. And Survivors defintiely shouldn't just be giving themselves up to a Killer for a free sacrifice because they feel bad for the Killer.
---
Okay. By that logic:
---
Trapper applies pressure because good survivors will go and disarm his traps. 
---
also getting injured by a trap reveals to teammates so if a teammate is nearby, then they both work on a gen together. 
---
I believe Billy is the one with the most pressure since he is by far the fastest. #Fastboi
---
Tru3 plays 7-8h  a day and he plays out of the stream too.
---
I think that's the same for most of these guys.
---
Kage Bushin no, Jutsu! 
---
they get salty EVEN WHEN THEY WIN, I have pc but my power supply blew in my pc so currently saving to get a new one 
---
A kill is worth 1K points, assuming a killer is able to chase and hook a survivor while the other gets unhooked and escape, a hit is worth 500 points and a hook is worth 200, 300 less. 
---
Ultimately its more BP and an assured sacrifice.
---
Survivors want to act like there isn't such a thing as being overly altruistic. Altruism gets many a cocky survivor killed. [FOR EXAMPLE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjTB705qKc4)
---
Here's a fun fact: I didn't say that until I was already in the negatives. It was a statement describing something that was already happening. Sorry for killing your narrative, kiddo
---
Wooooosh 
---
*butt dancing in progress, butt dancing in progress*
---
Sorry have to disagree with Trapper. I love to play  against him. The trapping spots are predictable and it takes forever to "setup" in the beginning of the game. Same as hag. Mobility is the key to pressure I believe. Hillbilly and Nurse. Unless you are running some insane addon's on the Trapper, I would say he is one of the weaker killers. Right near the Bing Bong Boi, Freddy, LF
---
I almost never play SWF and still get 2 gens done every game. You're being ridiculous 
---
Yea, but there's camping and there's rubbing your chainsaw into the hooked person's face.
---
They're equally as effective, one's just more toxic.
---
*2 downvotes*
---
So you're one of those garbage pieces of shit that abuses DCing. Nice, the devs should ban people like you for 14 days, but you're lucky they don't give a flying fuck
---
I was just adding my thoughts. Does every reply that doesn‚Äôt agree with you outright mean that they are attacking your opinion? Chill. 
---
And all these downvotes on my original post, like why lmao
---
I usually get a good number of trapped survivors. people are just potatoes and don't do it right
---
We have enough brain to make traps
---
Pig if you have a giant fucking brain like me.
---
Clown if you wanna slice people with a butterfly knife and go (out loud) HOOO HAHA HAAAAAAA and wheeze at people like a 16 year old trying weed for the first time
---
LMAO i love both of them akrjd
---
People complained queue times were too long so now you get matched with anyone from anywhere no matter how far away from you they are.
---
*2 downvotes* I wasn‚Äôt aware, ‚Äúmassively,‚Äù was a word use to describe small quantities. 
---
Entity: "Where do you think you are going, my friend"
---
&gt; Trapper applies pressure because good survivors will go and disarm his traps. 
---
I don't disagree with this. It also tells you where a survivor is hanging out
---
&gt; also getting injured by a trap reveals to teammates so if a teammate is nearby, then they both work on a gen together. 
---
There are a number of presumptions being made here and I'd rather have two people on one gen than two on two gens

Would you like to hear about our lord and savior the almighty Hag?

These motherfuckers literally brag about disconnecting against Legion but this guy disconnected against a toxic group of children **once** and they're a piece of shit? I expect to see you on every thread talking about disconnects then.
---
How can you say she doesn‚Äôt have map pressure just because it‚Äôs rng? It forces survivors to do something other than generators. You‚Äôre right about the pallet thing, but she has a way to counter pallet looping while other M1 killers have no way. You can also just mindgame them at the pallet with crouch. Sometimes you ambush, sometimes you stand back up. 
---
I would have picked the DS girl first that time you left 3 ppl on the floor.  That way you make her use it and still have 2 down.   
---
You could also easily have gotten one more at the 3:55 mark (she was on the totem behind you).  
---
Your spirit playstyle is good, and it's only the small things you can improve on.
---
The survivors you faced was not the best cuz they don't really know how to loop. Try to mindgame by moonwalking or looking the other way while phasing. Make sure you don't mindgame yourself.
---
I also think it would be more interesting if you showed a game where gens are done and you get under greater stress.
---
See also, survivors that want the killer to get the last hook to be nice
---
I believe you. When the traps start popping, it's all down hill for the survivors. My comment was not meant to be negative. Good luck and I'm sure you are a very good trapper. 
---
Seems like half my lobbies are over 250 ping now and half of the ones under 250 ping are sitting at like.. 230 ping which is still terrible. 
---
I don't know why they haven't given us a ping limit option yet. 
---
You know, seeing it from a redemption point if view makes a lot of sense. That actually helped me understand it a lot lol
---
I mean, it‚Äôs a shitty counter to Ebony. Can‚Äôt really get mad at the players because the devs don‚Äôt address it.
---
"very good" is pushing it lol
---
360s don't always work, and against good players they nearly never work.
---
And a good legion won't let you stun them, they know they can vault over it so why would they just run through a pallet.
---
Also saying just to 360 or go to a pallet? That's just general advice for any killer. That's not any counters to his power, those are just counters to a killer (if you can count them as counters)
---
bop bop
---
Lol..if you are 4k'ing in Low Ranks with The Trapper, you are more than good. ;)
---
Camping hatch, you?
---
My PC was broken a few days, too. Console dbd never again.
---
Tier based on how angry spell check is.
---
Also implying people like playing against Billy and Doctor??????????
---
I don't go after specific survivors; I do however tend to go after who I have the best bet to actually get. Maybe it would be considered tunneling, but I go after any survivor I see. If, while I'm chasing that survivor all of a sudden I hear other survivors dropping pallets, messing up skill checks, etc, just basically making noise across the map, I don't leave the survivor I'm currently chasing. I've got somebody in my sights, I'm not going to run across the map to maybe find somebody else.
---
If there's one survivor who's clearly a much higher skill level, i.e. they are looping, juking, 360ing and basically making me look like a fool, I'll generally ignore them. No point wasting an entire match pointlessly chasing them while 3 others get all the gens.
---
If I'm after an injured survivor and a healthy survivor cuts me off to try and draw me away or confuse me with the conflicting scratch marks, I will usually try and stay on the injured survivor. 
---
The one main exception is if a survivor is following me as I'm in the process of hooking a survivor and they immediately unhook them. That's either them being a dick or they have Borrowed Time, and I'll usually go after the survivor who unhooked
---
&gt;  It makes sense to target the one you just hooked but I make a point to target them first.
---
"You want that safe hook bonus? Alright, can you pay the price of being hooked yourself?"
---
That's what I mean though, even Tru has nowhere near 10000 hours lol, let alone 12k. Like I hope this guy streams because he definitely doesnt have a normal job. Playing 12 hours a day plus average for almost 3 years is only leaving like 4 hours for eating, showering, and other daily stuff...
---
Pig runs at 115% movement speed because she has shoes and doesn't have to be careful not to step on something sharp.
---
Granted that argument goes out the window with Plague but I guess she lived in a time before glass so she didn't have to be scared of stepping on glass.
---
Perhaps, I would've made the meme better by adding a survivor's face along, and then created a killer version.
---
If a killer dcs from a lobby because he doesn't like the map, survivors, or any other reason he should be banned no fucking questions. You think that's healthy for any online game? 
---
Wasting everyone's time. Some people can only play a few matches before/after work or whatever they do with their lives. Ruining the experience for everyone just because the killer wants to be a salty little bitch isn't cool. 
---
&gt;There‚Äôs a reason why I choose to run Lullaby over Ruin, survivors don‚Äôt have immediate urgency to get rid of Lullaby unlike ruin.
---
Yeah, but they usually cleanse it fast anyway, because it also gives notification after first skillcheck.
---
I always seem to get placed in the game, the institute or the swamp and it‚Äôs really annoying

Of they are swf the perk doesn‚Äôt help them because they can communicate your position and by any chance were you playing leatherface.
---
Honestly I had no idea that the flapping meant camper. I rarely play survivor except SWF where we have voice chat, but when I do play with randoms I always thought the flapping was just general boredom/impatience to be off the hook. Kind of like mindlessly jumping or running in circles in MMOs.
---
Sitting on the hook with nothing to do, might as well play with the only animation available to break up the monotony.
---
Nah spirit 
---
I bring the last one always to the hatch IF he stops struggling
---
I laughed way to hard at this.
---
To this day I don't understand how you can fail at facecamping with Leatherface. It's the easiest goddamn thing in the universe.
---
In my experience, they don‚Äôt look for Lullaby until there‚Äôs 3+ hooks already.
---
Map pressure = Not needing ruin. At least 2/4 boxes are right by gens. Plus, if you find the trapped target, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Pig can fall off really hard because traps are inconsistent. 
---
She has no move speed ability and walks slower in ambush so she can‚Äôt even consistently get a first hit. 
---
Wraith is more consistent at getting a free hit. 
---
2 wrongs make a right...?
---
How dare that have run 2 unltra rares fucking toxic
---
Lol what ever you say homie. And here's a fun fact  trying to talk down to someone by calling them a kiddo makes you look like a real big boy, maybe you'll actually get out of your pull ups one day.
---
The only thing that bothers me about the hatch is how long it prolongs a game. IDC if survivors get a ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù card. Who cares? This game isn‚Äôt competitive, it‚Äôs casual. A 3k is a win every time.
---
What bothers me is how fucking long a survivor will crawl around the map looking for it. I don‚Äôt even care if a survivor gets the hatch and sometimes I will literally go AFK in a corner so the game will just end while p3 Claudette takes her sweet ass time. It‚Äôs a shitty, frustrating mechanic. 
---
Maybe not that by default, but a leech that does slow down your progress toward generators (with addons that allow for other effects such as aura reading or making really loud killer-alerting noise or something) and needs to be healed/mended in order to remove them (but other survivors can help remove leeches).
---
M‚Äô lady
---
Behvr be like new matchmaking is live, don't you love us
---
I have this problem too, my fps is 45-60 and the skill check is like 25 fps
---
Freddy makes this perk backfire hard.
---
If I'm on my last hook even if I'm not the last survivor I dont struggle tbh. It's made for very interesting games when the killer realizes this
---
Lucky you, in my games Lullaby usually gets cleansed after first token max.
---
Someone goes out of their way to offer advice and you shit on her for no reason? 
---
Blood and moaning have gotten me my fair share of kills. Not sure why you decided to be a dick but you do you hun. 
---
Killer: hey that's illegal
---
XD Down with the chainsaw camper!
---
L1 cancels healing. I think it works with unhooking too 
---
I never said you were attacking my opinion. But when you challenge the creative design of the game and flip to say you don‚Äôt actually care, it‚Äôs begs the question why even add you or opinion. Also you got downvoted cause you literally flipped stances lol. 
---
Tree hugging,you?
---
It‚Äôs a strategy, but a toxic strategy. It‚Äôs not viable, cancer for both the killer who has nothing to do for a whole 2 mins (random number), the survivor who watches his life slips away and the other survivors who feel bad
---
Bruh its already in the game
---
hahaha this is just blatantly false
---
Just the nature of the website. Karma doesn't mean anything anyway, don't worry about it too much.
---
It's all fun and games till someone gets pink eye

Yes, we‚Äôre jealous of a guy named ‚Äústoned primate‚Äù who gets to stay at home and play video games all day. Gg.

YOIBCANT CPUNTER HIM THAT'S WHY PEOPLE HATE HIM. Holy shit am I sick of that argument
---
1. Only idiots get 360d
---
2. Stunning them will never weapon if they just bait out pallets
---
3. They will just moonwalk to kill you
---
WHERE IS THE COUNTERPLAY?

He felt bad for the puny mortals he dc'd
---
/r/WholesomeDBD
---
Man... Sometimes I really rather use any other forum. 
---
Blood warden oh my....
---
I don't use it on any killer because totem spawns are a joke and i assume R1's *should* be able to hit great skill checks anyways (i know most survivors are garbage but i go into a match expecting the "worst").
---
I do just fine without it at R1. 
---
Yeah it's totally fair for him to be angry, just not at the survivors,
---
How do you get it caught in the zipper every time. 
---
can we keep with the hate for legion instead of spirit tho?
---
"Killers will now see the lobbies filled up with 4 survivors instantly"
---
I'm actually not seeing this happen. I did a few games today, and still saw survivors trickle in one at a time. Am I missing something? (PC player here)
---
I don't get it
---
Your post history of crying about swf, the hatch, ds, and basically everything else in the game that doesn‚Äôt benefit killers 
---
It's really not bad.
---
When you cant get enough attention so you go for the mdfk t-pose
---
Maybe my personal definition isn't accurate to how it's generally used, but I always look at it as 3 distinct things. Face camping being standing right in front of the hook, as this leather face was doing. This is attempting to stop survivors from even trying to unhook.
---
Proxy camping being moving around the immediate area, circling nearby obstacles, but never going a significant distance from the hook to the degree of not losing line of sight for more than a second or 2. This is making it blatantly clear to survivors going for the unhook that you'll be on their ass in a flash.
---
Patrolling being checking the general area around a hook but not maintaining constant or even frequent line of sight. Far enough away that survivors going for unhook won't know if you're still nearby, but you are still close enough to catch their scratch marks and get into a chase quickly once you get the unhook alert.
---
Just my two cents on the terminology.
---
Except it‚Äôs blatantly true. 360s don‚Äôt fuck up auto-aim anymore like they used to, if you get 360d it‚Äôs bc you missed and need to learn how to flick
---
Happened to me last week, I‚Äôm still ashamed i even teabagged, i never do it and i suffered for it
---
Me neither 
---
Funny mori affects everyone pc and console included
---
Object of Obsession is an incredibly great tool, especially against a huntress. Even moreso in a SWF group to the point of being pretty much unfair. 
---
Staring at crows, you?
---
BBQ&amp;Chili is just a good perk. That has nothing to do with Pig. And survivors will look around to see you. You can also hear her moving, and she makes a stupid noise before she dashes so survs can get out of the way. She's just not good. You can 4k with LF pretty consistently. That doesn't mean LF is a good killer.
---
any killer is good at rank 1 with the right person 
---
Yea but I feel like PC players suck it up more, lately on console everyone leaves, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs new people or the rank reset, and i got DDosed once cause of a mori
---
lol this is a load of horseshit
---
1) my comments literally say that I'm fine with the hatch and think the stand-off needs to be addressed
---
2) I think NOED needs to be nerfed
---
3) I think ebonies need to be removed
---
4) I think Dying Light needs a bigger nerf than it's getting
---
5) I think some killer add-ons need to be reworked
---
6) unlike most of this sub I think Plague is too strong
---
fun fact: some of us actually care about game balance. just because I talk shit about your favorite survivor crutches doesn't mean I'm ~entitled~
---
Sans Doctor skin when? Plus it needs to change the Shock Therapy sound to the Gaster Blasters.
---
Focused mode enabled for 60 seconds
---
NI-
---
spirit is so fun and satisfying when you get good with her
---
originally i sucked at her but i kept practicing and she‚Äôs my second fave killer now 
---
Good, the confusion is settling in nicely. 
---
nah i just didn't want to be a dick and say i thought it looked shit 
---
To be fair ruin often only lasts a minute or less. Spawns are really bad and more often than not completely out in the open.
---
I can't believe how easy it is to DC on PC. It's like in the options menu? Is it like that on console? I guess I've never looked. 
---
When you go into tattooing still not knowing how to draw hands
---
I feel people are gonna use it combined with hex ruin more though. It would make sense to do so
---
And if the entity is having a really bad time and takes more points then a grab would give?
---
Or where would u get the least amount of points for 
---
literally the only reason the perk ever does anything is because idiots go out of their way to find it instead of repairing through it. 
---
Not just the MEN, but the woMEN and childMEN too!
---
Never seen a meg so aggressive. Rare breed I guess
---
The amount of anxiety this gave me is unreal 
---
Well it doesn't, and your opinion is shit. 
---
I do the same when I see I‚Äôm not affected by it; it makes sense. I play hag often and I don‚Äôt use it with her; far better perks like make your choice for example
---
3 gens popping within a minute and a half of the game starting is BS. Another 2 popping within the next minute and a half is as well. Often by 4 to 5 minutes the game is completed.
---
Until they fix that games are really dang short ruin needs to stay as is.
---
That floating knife though
---
This wasn‚Äôt funny, you just wastes someone‚Äôs time , offerings and items.
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt used pig correctly if you say her power does nothing in the chase

YOU'RE THE WORST.
---
Hah, I played with her earlier. I was surprised as well 
---
I thought she was paralysed. Didn't she choke herself to death? That would probably stop me from using my legs ;(
---
Cuz theyre sending hate mail saying i was camping 
---
Tunnel until they're hooked. The actual Dying light is tunnel until they're dead.
---
&gt; it‚Äôs already difficult to have 4 survivors without communication find the totem
---
imagine thinking this
---
Honestly, Sprint Burst already feels like it has an invulnerability period. You move as fast as a lunge, and thus miss 95% of attempted hits. The *only* time you'll hit someone on a SB is if they moved too late or ran towards the killer. 
---
It's the truth tho
---
Wraith is best
---
Oh right I thought you were the streamer. My bad.
---
According to some peoples rule books you should walk away to some random corner of the map in search of the other survivors, even if you see all the other survivors around the hook.
---
THIS
---
 I go by the best unwritten rules of this game:
---
1 - Play how you want to play and enjoy the game.
---
2 - Respect is akin to Newtons 3rd law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Ergo, if you show no respect, don't expect any.
---
3 - The Killers role is to kill, the Survivors is to survive... **Both by any means necessary**. Hate the game, not the player.
---
4 - When the gates are powered... **Anything goes**.
---
5 - You paid money for a multiplayer experience, and thus aren't entitled to win every match. Anyone who takes umbrage to this should stick to single-player games where-in you are entitled to win for the money you paid. Being salty because of a lost match is unbecoming, embarrassingly juvenile, and toxic to the communities reputation. We're all people pitting our skills, strategies, and knowledge against each-other. If you lose and have nothing good to say: Leave a "gg," calm down/lick your wounds, and move onto the next match.
---
6 - (For PC players anyways) Post game chat can be closed using the "&gt;&gt;" in the lower right of the chat box, and will remain closed until you either open it again or restart the game. No one deserves abuse, so if you find yourself frustrated over excessive endgame chat toxicity: Just close it, and continue enjoying the game in peace.
---
Follow these, enjoy the game, and use rule 6 if feeling abused in post game chat to relive the frustration while learning how to play killer. Players never show any leniency when using all of the games available mechanics for their advantage, and you shouldn't ever feel shitty for taking advantage of them when playing either side, or feel frustrated when they are used against you (Rule 3). To me, survivor is easy and relaxed play for most of the time, but killer is always a challenge which is something I crave. You get hate from both sides in either role no matter how good or bad you play, but you don't deserve abuse while you are learning to play and trying to have fun. Nurse is currently the killer that has the highest learning curve, but also the highest rewards for putting in the effort to master. It really made me feel accomplished when I earned that skill level, and you shouldn't have to take abuse and discouragement from anyone while you are getting there.
---
Have a good time buddy, take advantage of the games mechanics in any way you want, play how you want to play, and don't let anyone discourage you.
---
 
---
Nope, he was the killer, everyone had a good laugh after and spammed jojo memes in after game chat 
---
block them? Like it literally does not matter, what is the point about caring what some random shitter says? 
---
They missed something. there is a killer perk called Thrill Of The Hunt. It makes one of the totems on the map lit. And whenever a lit totem is being worked on by a survivor the killer gets a notification and it makes cleansing totems take longer 
---
&lt;3 love you tho 
---
Yep, also like that on console..
---
I don't see speed hacks, I just see a Claudette who didn't skip leg day. She decided to make use of that free gym membership the Entity gives out.
---
It is in no way necessary, and I speak from experience. Stop bringing Ruin and help develop a playstyle without it, you'll be fine in no time.
---
Source: many, many hours, primarily killer 
---
I agree, I would definitely would have looked for a different artist 
---
Ain't nothing wrong with that. I've had abuse from survivors for the exact same, and all I can say to them is learn some tactics. Let one survivor lead me away on a chase and then go for a hook rescue. But don't expect me to chase off after one, when the other 2 are sitting right behind the hook waiting to insta-save. 
---
Yep. Absolutely. God, I love seeing them panic like this...
---
Oh, I don't refer to red ranks as "low" like some people do. That threw me off
---
If the exit gates aren't open I never even check on the hooked survivor. No need for it. 
---
YoU‚ÄôrE wRoNg REEEEEEEE
---
LOL, MY OPINION IS BETTER
---
-REP
---
Now I'm thinking that the doctor was actually Dr. Bright and nobody even noticed
---
Nah. They have to earn that hatch, even if I don't really care about getting 4K or not. I'll usually place a few traps around it and look for them because I *hate* the standoff. If I catch them early? They snooze, they lose. 
---
I know its not a popular opinion but i think he is fun to play as and play against. 
---
Lmao true story. Love this memeic art series ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
I‚Äôm a woman too, now you get two upvotes 
---
It‚Äôs cool I understand 
---
We toxic ladies gotta stick together 
---
I don't know because this is my first encounter with the term "proxy camping".
---
To me it sounds like a term made up by disgruntled survivors as another excuse as to why they couldn't save someone.
---
Survivor Post Game: CAMPER!  
---
Killer: I was patrolling...  
---
S: NO, YOU WERE... PROXY CAMPING!
---
It‚Äôs not even fun. How can they enjoy this
---
You feel 10,000 volts of electricity crawling down your back.
---
1. Yes.
---
1.2 No, stall *helps you win sometimes* snowball *is* you winning.
---
2. I wasn't using it against him. And what if they are all decent survivors? You can track people all day but if you cant catch them there is no point.
---
8.2 Tracking is not nearly as good as chasing. I will take weaker tracking and strong chasing any day. Huntress is good. I'm saying she is overrated.
---
1. When i said mash teleport it was in reference to a different survivor hitting a trap outside of your chase. Maybe you are right about her not being map dependent, but i still think she is weaker then billy just because of the set up time alone.
---
On a good map maybe you can wait for a deadzone. But games end quickly when the survivors know they have nothing to fear from the killer. Slugging is almost always worse then hooking, that's not really an opinion that's just math.
---
All the time freddy saves is eaten up by the time he is in a chase. He has less time then other killers.
---
But he doesn't have any more time then anyone else. In fact, I would say, *he has less time*.
---
The pinky finger is in front of the ring finger. That hand is wack 
---
Honestly bots would be a God send for practicing things out. Sometimes I like mixing things up and trying totally new builds. It's rough not getting a chance to practice it a bit before going in to a real match.
---
The downvotes speak for themselves. Apologize and you get your meaningless karma back.
---
Joke has been done before but the format is original, so it's worth an upvote\~
---
Frankly people who DC and lobby dodge deserve a short term ban. 
---
"As the Wraith..."
---
(happiness noises) 
---
Hmm i'll have to remember that spot
---
Survivors are stupid. I main survivor but it‚Äôs so painful when not in a full group
---
More like M'Freddy
---
Oh that‚Äôs also a huge thing with pig
---
But you are getting lobbies quicker, correct?
---
Dude ignore him. Look at his name, he's clearly a troll.
---
I had to change that sytatement bc I said they were the same. They really arent but people (and me) often use them synonymously. Proxy essentially means sticking around the same area and flushing. Patrolling means going back and forth more or less. Like if a killer hooks somebody, runs to a gen, runs back, runs to a different gen. If you stay on somebody on hook even if you see somebody else, youre a camper anyway. There is always a time and place for proxying but if its unnecessary people will call you a camper. If you feel scummy its scummy
---
It's an understandable mistake. I know I've don't it myself with pictures rehosting web comics instead of linking to the artists page. I was also pointed out reasons why it's bad and just wanted to spread the message along. 
---
Just be sure to always post the original artists page/video next time if possible. 
---
She can be looped, simple as that.
---
Sorry, I'm quite new to playing. How do you fake to pick up a downed survivor? 
---
When it's not the optimal outcome.
---
I'd love the SFX for it if nothing else 
---
I always forget I have it when I run it lol
---
Agreed heavily. I dont play solo survivor any more bc 99% of the time theres 3 Nea Urban Evading away from me because they heard the faintest whisper of the heartbeat. And then I play killer and I verse survivors who actually want to win, so they rush gens, 4 man adren and all escape without me being able to do anything. Even Nurse can't deal with that shit. Sad thing is is that nothing will change balance wise bc 99% of survivors are idiots, like you said.
---
Nice linework. üëç
---
Makes sense. So basically he needs to hope not to play against an swf?
---
And those loops are incredibly strong ;)
---
I'd put Hag at Billy tier as well tbh. People just dont play her right which is why she is underrated.
---
Had a game where I was doing my daily for nurse and I had crushed them really hard. I found out post game chat that they kinda had a disadvantage. The part I liked though was even though I had been hard on them, everyone except for 1 ds user was still super nice. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/0nTpM4O
---
When your feeling it's getting difficult don't bother doing gens, take were goin to life forever + borrowed time. 4 saves and chases net me 16k post game with a safety or de pip. 
---
As long as you don't DC/kill yourself early in game nobody should bitch  
---
Have fun 
---
15 boolets per clipperooney 
---
overwhelmingly is silly though. that's seriously overratign it. he is stronger than most killers on it, though 
---
In most of my games the killer drops the last guy on hatch...
---
...Just cuz i'm a killer main i don't think that affects the statistic that much
---
Wait, it's supposed to work?
---
Favorite thing to do as the Hag is silence my traps and deafen the person that triggered it. Some I miss, but in the end, the never see it coming. Literally just sacrificed 4 ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
When you tell people dc'ing mori/legion to just play the game 
---
Pretty much I don‚Äôt blame people for camping as him because that‚Äôs really all he‚Äôs good at doing he‚Äôs bad at everything else
---
I think a new speed hacks software came out for dbd recently and all the little script kiddies pay money to have it on their computer so they can achieve great things in life :)
---
I love how you used the voting thing 
---
I don't understand people who game without challenge. The only thing you're getting out of this is easy BP and at that point you're just playing a very elaborate Idler game.
---
Killers be like "I can't float."
---
This post was made by the Sally Gang.
---
I am arguing that he's bad for the game not that he's not fun to play as. 
---
Love playing Freddy. Fire Up and Blood Warden I use often. Remember Me helps with BW. Then I either run NOED or another one. So fun.
---
Killer be like ‚ÄúI can breathe‚Äù
---
This post was made by asthma nurse gang
---
Well it was quite difficult to get that from a two word argument.
---
So everybody else has to play a boring game and have no fun just so you can have fun running around being a twat? A killer can be fun to play and not be awful to play against.
---
Exodia: yellow mori
---
Me: üòÖ
---
Downed Claudette before reaching hatch
---
You know I gotta hit you with "Haddonfield House" loop.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know you know who I am and what I do for a living? Lol gg
---
I grind auric cells by working at my job.
---
Man you sure showed him. Instead of looking for the hatch, trying to get a gen, or even attempting a save (which is stupid against a face camper though).
---
You sat there and pointed, good work man you used the time that the killer is giving you to do literally nothing.
---
Can't control the map when two people bring the offering, but yeah. I get when to leave and pressure gens / go for another house. Thanks for the input.
---
Point is, that's at least an interesting concept. "Runs fast and stabs you a lot" is not. 
---
Confirmation bias.
---
Calm down mr tough guy.
---
I always will lead one survivor to the hatch if another one DC's. It's a fair trade.
---
Beautifully done! Engaging in another chase to buy time was a bold and great play! That pig should have gone stealth to stop that but you played it perfect and deserved the win. GG
---
Backpack build! Iron grasp/agitation/mad grit. Run those survivors down with a backpack.
---
Well thanks!
---
He is, after they put him and a battery in 914 on ‚Äòfine‚Äô
---
RNG is this entire game, i don't want to make it so survivors are too weak but i don't want the killer to get gen rushed. Messing up a skill check early on will help the killer start effectively and get into a chase, also missing a skill check makes it harder to gen rush. Also i would like there to be more, as in a lot more skill checks and make the great a wee bit smaller
---
I dont think that would be enough tbh. It will work for a week but then they would adapt.
---
How can you see chili boi when he‚Äôs cloaked with insidious though?
---
I like to bring the second to last to the hatch when possible. It's always a shock to them when the killer drops them on the hatch and nods a bunch before killing the fourth survivor. I can't do it very often, but it's very satisfying to pull off.
---
A wise man once said, "I'm not going to respect your pallets, I've never respected pallets."
---
He's Rank Zero. This is totally sound advice.
---
I got saved from certain death by a saboteur Claudette. Just as the killer was going to hook me for the last time she destroyed the hook and when the killer tried another nearby hook she destroyed that hook too giving me enough time to wiggle out and get away. The killer disconnected. Claudette, wherever you are, you have my eternal thanks.
---
Spirit, DS is the most stupid perk in this game. I;m gonna use it only after the rework and now only for adept Laurie. Just bullshit.
---
What do you think about noed rewarding killers for not being able to kill survivors before the gens are done?
---
As a survivor main, is really shitty when a killer do poorly all the match and then get hooks only because they have noed. I dont really mind being hooked or killed when the match is intense and the killer keeps us on out toes.
---
Are you implying that's bad...?
---
Well, the way to combat that would be too give the survivors ways to extend the timer, such as alerting the killer to other survivors, it would make sense theme wise because in the movies saw made the reverse bear trapped person do shit to others to make get rid or extend the timer
---
More likely than not the LF got ran around all game or couldn‚Äôt catch anyone and when he finally did he decided to camp. Atleast that‚Äôs what happens a lot on PS4. Honestly with the gates open camping is fine and most survivors agree on that poin, but it wouldn‚Äôt fit the killer mains narratives if they didn‚Äôt make us sound like whiny survivors who ‚Äúwant it our way all the time.‚Äù
---
A guy looking at a wireshark isnt enough to jump to any conclusions 
---
I usually don't do too bad against Legion, what mainly try to do is make as much distance as possible and break line of sight when they use their frenzy since they can't see scratchmarks when using it. A lot of the time they're gonna wait for you to throw the pallet so they can jump after and smack you, really try to go for stuns.
---
That would again be to op. Plus it would encourage working with the killer, which is against the rules.
---
The cells are still more than buying dlc since you get only half. It‚Äôs easy to split a portion after that as a flat fee to a license. 
---
im sorry but freddy gets sooooooo much hate if you actually win as him
---
I see you met the normal SWF squad. Don‚Äôt feel bad for teabagging if they were toxic
---
I find that if the lobby is taking a long time, leaving to the main menu and starting over sometimes makes it quicker. I've left and came back numerous times and somehow get a lobby within a few seconds lol. 
---
Hmm. Spirit, freddy, myers and maybe pig are really fun killers to play as. Spirit and Freddy need to be worked on for a long time to be good with them. Myers and Pig are easy to play and have basic abillities but they lack map pressue. The best of them is spirit, able to scare survivors and end chases really really quickly 
---
No, Yes, No, Yes but not for the same reasons, yes.
---
I think that's a great idea and sounds like a simple change too. Hopefully dedicated servers brings a few changes and not allow a 2v1 to begin with!  
---
Yeah it just wouldn't work IMO, even Lullaby doesnt work against good survivors. There needs to be a good secondary objective imo
---
they deserved those face camps
---
I sure as fuck don't. I don't care if Survivors use DS, even before the changes. Bring on the DS, flashlights, Firecrackers/Party Starters, I don't care. It doesn't bother me, it's a part of the game. It makes my job as Killer harder, but that's fine with me
---
I don't consider ANYTHING in this game to be unfair from either side. I literally do not give a fuck. If I'm playing Survivor and I get tunneled, big fucking whoop. It happens sometimes. Oh no, I'm being face camped? Oh well, that's 1k for him while my 3 teammates hopefully escape, I'll join a new match once I'm dead.
---
But no, let's talk shit about people who are good Killers and can get kills quick. Let's call them sweaty tryhards because they're good at what they do. Fuck off with that nonsense.
---
It is nobody's job to make the game more enjoyable for anyone. The game has a set of rules and mechanics that we are bound to play with. Anything within those is fair unless it's something like purposely stalling the game which is against TOS.
---
Damn, this person did not even play a part in creating him, and he is this upset over the hate for them.
---
Id still hit that, tbh.  She aged well.
---
Will try thanks
---
I love Clown's trailer. 
---
Why is Bubba up there? O.o It was horrible, Freddy's was better.
---
Or they can properly playtest the shite they make and not make another shit cash grab attempt like Legion. With he new chapter they seem they have learned their lesson.
---
I meean, I'm not an expert at dbd but, doesn't this make the pig wayy to powerful? 
---
Oh, I didn't. Not here. 
---
I usually play pretty chill, and let folks escape after messing with them for my points, but when I run across folks like this? NAH. 
---
Eh you can mindgame that by crouching and standing back up. Pigs ambush doesnt work all the time in a chase but it can help you.
---
Wow, a hardcore Legion defender turns out to be a creator of toxicity on the survivor side too. Big surprise.
---
im a spirit main when im at home, shes really fun and i think im good at her
---
What a surprise. Absolutely nobody saw this coming ever. /s
---
I have been doing this for a long time (after so many games, its pointless getting thirsty for every kill, although it probably took me like 300 hours to get over the "Grr scum survivors die" mentality. 
---
But with the pipping changes it looks like mercy will be rewarded with a swift depip to the balls. So expect to see killers get even more sweaty.
---
New perks include: in game chat, odd bulb buff, and d-strike buff. 
---
The amount of prayer beads is disgusting. It's become a rarity to see a Spirit without them.
---
I have an intense hatred for the toxic SWF
---
I agree but the game needs to fix bugs before a second objective with more bugs shows up
---
Thanks! You learn something new everyday.
---
Well it‚Äôs not a tattoo sub you loaf of bread 
---
I think that gave everyone anxiety, yeesh. It was weird though how the pig didnt just let you get beartrapp'd, you were so nesrly dead. 
---
It'll be good practice for you then . Chases is the only thing you can get good at as survivor... Can't get better at gens 
---
Tbf, he already found that hatch, it's literally in the video. Otherwise,you right. 
---
It's really the only way his power can actually be used effectively.
---
Unless you brought a toolbox or were sabotaging hooks, i'm not sure.
---
I think you need to put some scars on the arms, but apart from that it looks great!
---
I can't complain I'm on console and the game was free lol if it takes too long I just hop to another game
---
I think it's perfectly workable. Not all concepts have to be perfect. Some of the simplest concepts in this game like "throws sharp things at people" (Huntress), "places traps" (Trapper / Hag), and "runs fast" (Billy) are some of the most beloved Killers in this game.
---
I know, I was playing meg to be chased by the killer for 3 minutes, so this greatly helped with my daily ritual.
---
I love survivor. In fact I‚Äôm prestiged with all but ace and the 2 new guys. But I‚Äôm never toxic like that, when I do play SWF I never use a flashlight or anything like that. Just block them if they‚Äôre being assholes 
---
On the bottom under their bleed out timer?
---
The game‚Äôs server is based off the killers network connection...so if they have bad WiFi you will lag 
---
True, I just feel that since their goal is to survive and escape as as 1 person left it‚Äôs almost impossible to do gens- their only reasonable way out is hatch.  So I
---
Don‚Äôt find fair to standoff‚Äôs are a survivor issue and it‚Äôs as we killers should deal with it - I find my best fix is to just not get into a standoff- be it by playing better or just taking the L. 
---
Yeah I used to get into matches quickly and now it takes me a good five minutes on average. I guess it‚Äôs how they f i x e d it. 
---
No you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôve been having some really laggy games recently. Can‚Äôt even get onto a game as a survivor tonight! I can create my own lobby and play as a killer but that‚Äôs it. 
---
I brought nothing in. Nobody did.
---
Use the fact that he can't see scratch marks, so window juke him or pallet stun him to break him out of frenzy. You could just lead him to your teammates but I don't recommend that.
---
I do too. But, mostly because they make the game overall more toxic. They act this way, make a killer feel like rubbish-- so the killer does the same to the next lobby. 
---
Or they pass on these habits to newer players, and the cycle continues. 
---
I'm guilty of being that killer sometimes, as my previous comment suggests. I think it'd be best for the community if folks dialed it back a bit. You don't have to be toxic every match to have fun.
---
That‚Äôs a really good point. I can‚Äôt do the 360 thing at all and don‚Äôt wanna do looping just because I don‚Äôt wanna be like that with the killers. I‚Äôve been on the other end and get it. But I can do some juking sometimes that works at times if I‚Äôm lucky. But yeah it could be good practice.
---
I usually run Solvent Jug and Make-Up Kit on Clown. Though I have been messing around with other add-ons nowadays.
---
Fucking. Quality. Thank you for this hahahahah 
---
Having the exact same issue! I‚Äôve never had server issues before this week, I wonder what‚Äôs going on?
---
played my first game as The Pig, hooked 2 survivors and 1 escaped, and after 5 minutes the last one escaped too and he sent me "last second lol! gg" and something about it made me smile idk
---
That's a good idea. If less than a full crew load in, make it votable to abandon the game and return items. That plus keeping a full gen count and just lowering the requirement would balance out those events.
---
My game crashes pretty often and at random times, so I know it's happening to others.
---
Put NOED with that and you got....OMAE WA MOU SHINDEHIRU
---
I just want the power to stay the same way it is now, but increase some numbers. It's a very unique power that is at least fun to play around with. 
---
Pharmacy is definitely not trash
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and I agree. My main killer is Michael, and one game I hooked someone and noticed his teammates trying to be sneaky, hiding behind stuff, so I chased them around and downed two of them. I was called a camper, as if they expected me to ignore them and just walk off to somewhere else? 
---
Alert is used more since it shows where the Killer is when they break stuff, like gens. Dark Sense only triggers when *you* repair a gen.
---
Loop long enough? I am just one person, and I allways without fail get a gen by the time the first person gets hooked.
---
Match starts, and within 10 seconds I'm already on a generator. The Killer takes atleast 20, but I would rather say 30 seconds to find someone. 40 seconds to chase someone together with taking them to a hook and hooking them is an ideal chase. But even if you have the ideal chase I'm still popping a gen, and that is one person. If I was a in a team with 4 people like me this would be guaranteed and consistent. Also ruin does nothing to me since 4/5 times I can land the great skillcheck.
---
I understand how SWF is a huge advantage even just in terms of communication, but you don't need to be smart to win as survivors. The best way to play is to stay on a gen and repair, even if you hear heartbeat, don't bother hiding. If it gets louder you know it comes to you so you start moving to the closes pallet and get ready to loop.
---
It looks like a 4 year old did the spine.
---
So camping is a "valid strategy" but using flashlights and body blocking to try and save your teammate isn't a valid strategy? 
---
So basically it's only a valid strategy if it benefits you?
---
This also always happens to me against the pig for some reason. I'm always getting tunneled to death while they put that RBT on me. It's beyond annoying and frustrating. 
---
Aww, I wanted to see 
---
Me after a 4 man
---
Seriously - why even bother with the RBT?
---
You‚Äôre awesome!
---
When the killer just absolutely wrecks the group and then takes the final one to the hatch...so much respect.
---
Now you have to show us whenits done üòÉ
---
What do you guys think of Unbreakable? 
---
Under rated IMO.
---
Totally no bias here.
---
If you look at each Killer from a competitive perspective, you'll see that Pig isn't very viable in general.
---
Changes would be great. I know calling for survivor nerfs and killer buffs in this sub gives you a ticket to an instand beheading, but some innate gameplay changes to prolong the game a bit would be nice. The situation is still a lot better then it used to be, and I feel like it keeps getting better and better, but as killer if you face 4 good survivors it's hopeless to get anything done. Balance shouldn't cater to the noobs, but to the good players.
---
I feel your pain. 
---
Probably to get the extra points. 
---
To be honest with you, I honestly believe they do not know how to play her at all so they resort to camping and tunnelling. 
---
Eh,just practice with them in a real game. You‚Äôd only be hurting yourself learning unrealistic survivor tendencies. Besides what‚Äôs the worst that could happen?At worst you‚Äôll just lose a pip and or receive a msg saying something lame like ‚Äútrash killer‚Äù or ‚Äúez dud‚Äù
---
Unbreakabill is neat to use. Not super reliable, but it can make for some great plays when the killer just wants to keep you on the ground for a short time. Get yourself those surprise pallet slams or just sneak off like nothing ever happened. 
---
Will do! It won‚Äôt be for a while, but I‚Äôll revisit the post once I get the money and find a good artist
---
Just wait a few months I‚Äôm more than positive they‚Äôll bring them back again. Hell they brought back Chinese firecrackers.
---
A great work, keep it up.
---
I love it when garbage killers like that can't even face camp right
---
You should befriend them so you can keep doing this to them 
---
99% of the time, you won't get hit if you're using Sprint Burst, assuming you timed it right so...you're pretty much invincible.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
I think this guy was part of that toxic SWF I bounced on.
---
Taking a hit for someone is one thing, blocking the hook is another entirely. It‚Äôs the same thing as a killer body blocking a survivor so they can‚Äôt escape.
---
This is really often my experience with pigs too. Like, don't hunt me down at the jigsaw boxes. You already have me wasting time. Go after someone on a gen.
---
It gets worse as you rank up, survivors are even toxic to other survivors. 
---
I also picked it up when it was free on plus, I started developing aids gradually ever since.
---
had a 10 minute talk with the killer post chat about stuff. It was nice.
---
Exactly like if the timers going down let them do their thing. Mind you if your looking for survivors and you find one at a box well go for them then. But if your exclusively hunting down people with rbt what the fuck is wrong with you.
---
Keeping an eye out for the killer and skill checks at the same time? 
---
You never really HAVE to camp,well... at least face camp anyway 
---
That also. For the longest time I could always get a game in the first two minutes. Recently I have to switch to killer if I want to play in a timely manner
---
Mommy said "oink"? 
---
Is there something wrong with looping? What else should survivors do? Throw down the pallet immediately and stand still? 
---
OP did not say anything about flashlight or body blocking. What is a killer to do if we see the other survivors swarming the hook before we even are done hooking? Just go stand in the corner? Seriously. 
---
It‚Äôs true, and I think it‚Äôs because most console players are kids. There are some good folks on console as-well though, but yeah the PC community is a lot better. 
---
That entitlement is ridiculous
---
Hahahaha so true!
---
You don't have to make everything an adversarial us vs. them argument like anyone who criticizes Moris is an entitled survivor main. I'm mostly a killer main these days but I can admit Ebony Moris are absolutely overpowered. It's fine if you want to use them for revenge, but don't try to argue they're well-balanced, it straight up skips half of the work required for your win condition because you spent ~1/4th of a match's worth of BP.
---
Yes and no. It's kind of annoying losing 1-2 gens after chasing someone for less than a minute because of skill checks and various perks and add-ons that increase repair speed. Taking away the power of skill checks is necessary to slow the game down so the Killer actually has a decent chance to win without the use of gimmick perks. 
---
I rarely use Ruin too, and I can usually +1 pip each game. I just go in with my preferred loadout and just play. If I pip, then I pip. If not, then I don't. If the gens are going quickly during my night of playing, then I'll bust out a mori to equal out the kills I'm missing.
---
I am on PS4 too
---
Lol best camper in the game
---
Imo, sprint burst is the worst exhaustion perk. Sprint burst doesn‚Äôt help in a chase. Sure you might get some distance from the killer, but after that, you don‚Äôt get any help from it. Imo, dead hard is the best exhaustion perk bcuz it can let you make a good play if you made a bad one. 
---
just leave his chest alone 
---
Your killing me with those 4 puns
---
Drunk guys rambling is actually tame compared to some of the posts  I've seen in this sub tbh XD
---
I thought i had it bad that i keep getting russians when i'm on the eastcoast! :( sorry to hear that
---
They don't wonder tho
---
Nah i literally avoid hitting the guy who was just hooked. One, grabbing the other guy is a stack for bbq and chili, second and the most important reason is you never know if they have borrowed time. Feels bad when you tunnel the hooked guy and he enters deep wound and gets away anyways. 
---
Who said bodyblocking is bad? Learn to read ffs... " They call you camper or tunneller for everything, they call you out for using NOED. Oh hey but they can loop, they can flashlight, they can bodyblock, be total assholes. "
---
Let me translate it to you, don't call me out if you also do "unfun" strategies...
---
I can see the survivor circlejerk here anyway, judging by how my comment was downvoted.
---
RED PING!
---
LONG WAIT TIMES!
---
HUGE RANK GAPS!
---
NOT BEING ABLE TO DODGE SWF!
---
NOT FIXING OTHER BUGS!
---
[GO GO NEW MATCHMAKER!](https://youtu.be/BwbHW8MeHDU?t=64)
---
Valid point, however those are one of the first killers added to the game, so it was okay to cover those basic concepts first, before moving onto more tricky stuff (like Spirit or Plague). 
---
Consider this:  
---
 Huntress throws things at survivors. Clown also does that, but with his own unique twist. Good design, fits in perfectly.  
---
Hillbilly runs fast. Legion does that too...with a unique twist of not offering counterplay while demanding no skill investment. 
---
But yeah, maybe most of the "legion bad" memers probably don't shitpost because of what I described above, but rather following others, possibly motivated by getting tunneled by Legion once in a while.
---
I'm petty, not Satan.
---
Nobody c a r e s
---
As a pig main, this hurts to look at
---
Ultra rare add on sure, but a more proper pig buff would be a faster dash to counter sb, and not letting survivors with rbts take the hatch. 
---
Btw that‚Äôs a cool idea tho. 
---
Yup, i was excited for the buff but after running the perk for some more i noticed the lack of crows :/
---
Bro i promise you, go lower and you will pull your hair out. Nothing feels worse or more embarrassing than having a sef all get away tea bagging you at the gate and you depipping. Its blood boiling. Or being looped for 5 minutes straight while they gen rush. Sometimes the survivor gets the best of you and you wonder why you even bother playing killer
---
I think it would be unfair for survivors because if you ran an iridescent along with it you could make it so there are only two boxes.  Seems like it would cluster everything and frames would drop.  A better buff would be no hatch escapes while the trap is in and a timer that goes much faster.  Rather than delaying the game (purpose of rbt) they could be used as a deadly device.  Clearly the devs did not to make the pig op and the trend is clearly to make mid to low tier new killers.  Legion is not a tier 1.  He takes zero skill and is a nuisance to this game.
---
The equivalent of bodyblocking a hook is a hillbilly or leatherface blocking a survivor in a corner to chainsaw them.
---
Both those things are fine. I don't understand why you think they are toxic.
---
You dont. The poster above is full of shit
---
From what‚Äôs I‚Äôve been guessing it seems that they are using a bot so they derank 
---
Not sure why they would do that though 
---
Go lower
---
He would have gotten more points if he would have continued to hook trade with them instead of just camping one person till death 
---
There is no point in fixing the LAG MM if servers are around the corner. Thanks for the update!
---
Lol I'm just traumatized from toxic SWF man. Normally I'll just end the game quick and move on
---
Exactly what you said. A map with an add on that let's everyone see 
---
There‚Äôs an add on for the map which reveals everything to other survivors as well.
---
This is the key rule. If they are struggling chances are your efforts will be met with a gg ez in post game chat
---
My first game as Doctor (and I was pretty new to the game as well) I got absolutely rekt by a 3 man SWF group against whom I had absolutely no chance. Teabagging, flashlight spams, the like, it was an absolutely miserable game.
---
But in post-game chat they were actually suprisingly friendly and gave me tips and pointers (such as facing walls when picking survivors). Lots of toxic SWF games later, it's the only one which I can almost clearly remember.
---
Megs are the wanna be fengs/Claudette‚Äôs. They‚Äôll loop you and fail miserably only to dc on you
---
So that‚Äôd be scratched mirror, you put the vanity picture.
---
Anyway, ur obviously gonna 4k a lot with a red mori 
---
I'm not saying I've never had killer games that completely sucked, I've been matched with Rank one SWF's before and I only was able to kill one of them but they beat me fair and square, like I still pipped and got my daily. 
---
I just feel like in general you have more control over your experience as a killer. If I want to just play casually and mess around in that game then I'll go to killer everytime because you can easily rank up and get bloodpoints without killing a single person. If I just want to play casually, there is no such thing as that as a survivor unless the killer wants to farm. You have to go into every game assuming the killer has a Mori or NoEd or Hex Ruin and just wants to kill everyone. As a killer you can decide to say "fuck it, I'll just chase them for points and break pallets" if you're not able to kill anyone or you can camp (i  hate campers btw).
---
Like I get what your'e saying, I really do but my point is that I feel like generally there is more in your control as killer than there is for survivors. At the end of the day it's just opinion, however. 
---
OOF I FUCKED UP
---
You joke but sometimes I leave high ping lobbies only to reappear in the same one
---
Yeah that is a good advice. Sometimes you wanna gg and get or give feedback but it seems impossible in this game.
---
Awe a Leatherface in his natural habitat 
---
NO I DID, it is actually the scratched mirror, I deleted me comment lol
---
Damn, if self care skill checks wouldn't wake up anymore, that'd be insane. I've been playing nothing but freddy the last few days with advanced tips from long time freddy-mains, and even I can tell you this would be an over-buff. 
---
What he needs is the ability to pick survivors up while they are being healed in the dying state, and survivors not automatically waking up after being healed from dying. Those are really dumb mechanics. These two changes would make him so much better to play. 
---
You only have to do that at the start of the game tho. 
---
oh god oh fuck
---
No wait this is right. Fuck I need to wake up. Yeah the scratch mirror and Whispers have the same range.
---
*4 DC‚Äôs*
---
You should upload them. I feel like I‚Äôm being downvoted for asking an honest question that should be addressed. For now, I‚Äôm waiting a few days to play as survivor because I‚Äôm just getting matched with players in green or purple ranks. No red. It‚Äôs not fun when you want to play a good game and the other survivors are just doing gens and pretending like you don‚Äôt even exist!
---
They said they aren't doing anything from the ptb to live.
---
Ez bloodpoints
---
The thought of Shirtless Myers fucks us up
---
You don't have any chase perks. Clown is very good at forcing people to drop a pallet 1 loop earlier than they normally good, so Spirit Fury / Brutal Strength can be very good on him. Level up Spirit / Trapper respectively for those.
---
Bamboozle, Save the best for last, and 3rd seal can be good.
---
The thing is, changing the objectives would be a nerf to one side.
---
If a killer beat us in a 3k without being rude I make a little noise in the basement or around a hook and give them a 4k. 
---
Side note Kawaii Schoolgirl Spirts are so campy and slappy idk why but I've ran into 7 different ones who all get slappy and toxic.
---
Correct 
---
My favorite one is to kill 1 surv by my hand as Nurse. I *could* be a tryhard and use an ebony mori, but I use the yellow one so that the survivors can actually have a real match, too. Only problem is the last one d/cs nearly every time...
---
"There's too many Legion is bad posts" are the new "legion is bad" posts.
---
Personally I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôve had plays where I‚Äôm breaking a pallet and they get a skill check from self care and wake up then they have the ability to run to an infinite and not be vulnerable. 
---
What else should be implemented: during dream transition, any action should be paused and cannot gain progress.
---
He should have the ability to pull survivors off hatch, regardless if they are asleep or not. Or, you know, *let us close the hatch.*
---
And as mentioned earlier, better skill check odds. Refer back to, ‚Äúbreaking a pallet and they get a skill check while you‚Äôre breaking the pallet.‚Äù
---
I'm failing to see how that's suspicious. OP clearly outlined that in the past they have blocked RedShell.io for collecting data. OP recently noticed that DBD was still attempting to connect to RedShell but that it failed because OP has it blocked. OP then decided to make a post about it because they are concerned about it. I don't understand where your suspicion lies.
---
You're lacking in track, map pressure, and stalling so ideally you want Enduring, Corrupt Intervention, Whispers/BBQ&amp;C, and PGTW.
---
It takes a special kind of killer to fuck up camping. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Sad that wraith dailies pay out less.
---
Awww
---
now want to play *Bloodpoint Clicker*
---
Yeah that's true, would be super time consuming
---
Yeah that's true, would be very time consuming
---
If we stomp the killer hard, or after the exit gates are opened I'll run right up to them and just sit still in front of them. Let them atleast get one kill and try to not have them de pip or something
---
I mean you lose points for letting her live and be on a gen. What is letting one person getting out ON TOP of a dc really do? Not enough to net you more points than ending the game earlier than later
---
I hate that perk. as if SWF wasn't OP enough we have a perk which allows one player to tell his buddies where the killer is exactly at all times. I always go for these players first and make sure they're out, I feel like a hostage in these games anyways. 
---
Is that a p3 Claudette? shieeeeettt
---
Myers are always the ones who will give me a taxi ride and it's the best thing ever
---
Then why bag on someone‚Äôs tattoo ? 
---
Killer can and will smack you while your running to the gate, no point moving away from the hatch.
---
Lol tru3 the most biased killer main wtf watching him 
---
&gt;why is it that I only see leatherface camping?
---
Because wraith can cloak and Freddy is invisible.
---
Buh dum tis.
---
I feel like if it never came into play because gens weren't done, you didn't need the perk slot anyway 
---
Yeah they should really take parts from the other categories and make them survival instead. For example they should have active hex totems count towards survival. Most of the hex perks being deactivated contribute to the groups survival, so that should be in the survival category.  
---
Depends very much on how the match has gone.
---
Paradoxically if it's been a fair and hard fought match I won't give the hatch. At that point I feel I've earned the 4K fair and square. However of I've stomped the survivor team or I have a lone survivor who has been shafted either by poor play or multiple DCs then I'll do it.
---
I also don't do standoffs. If the survivor got to the hatch before me they can have it. 
---
Gimme back pink perks
---
Not on your team though. Nothing worse than being the 3rd person chased and finding there‚Äôs already no more pallets
---
Sir, that would be Freddy.
---
The other underrated Bs build is double cool down add ons hit them once run up and cancel you loose like 2 inches in the chase
---
How so? 
---
I know it's probably a really hard thing to get creative with while still maintaining balance. But I'm also sure survivors are getting bored doing 5 gens and then a door every game. It's hard though too because a team of competent survivors can get a lot done really fast, but then if you get a group where 2 suck, the game goes a completely different direction.
---
This is cute af.  Part 2 when?
---
Never seen this in my 2 years of playing
---
I can be rude if I want to, I was downvoted to oblivion as soon as I posted this picture for asking an honest question...
---
You just gotta find nice people :) 
---
Yup sorry friend have been around this game for a long time and they have shut down many things
---
Just clipped a game where I was bullied all game. Gates we're open as I got one basement hook. Due to altruism even a noob spirit like me could turn it into a 4k
---
Tbh, taking a quick look through their profile, they just seem to be mad at everything in general. If they were part of the SWF though, that'd be a neat outcome. 
---
I've given the 4th BBQ stack plenty of times, I've also made sure to give farming killers a kill if I know they got no points. Not that I was asking for it, but these favors have never been returned to me
---
If you hook someone and can see other survivors then go for the other survivors. Don't wait for them to unhook and down the person that was just unhooked. That's imo shitty and you're encouraging players to farm. It sucks that you have to force yourself to play like this but it shouldnt even be possible to ignore other people and tunnel one person the whole game (which is just bullying if you think about it) but the game devs are bad at design so you just have to choose to play like a decent human being. 
---
Adrenaline has made me audibly gasp and just stare at the screen. 
---
Well, lol you never have to be rude, but I digress. 
---
I agree, you should get people that are closer to your rank, but in my whole entire opinion, I would probably quit playing if I have to wait longer than the 30 minutes I already have to wait just to get ONE game. Nope.
---
Also if you wanted to avoid downvotes, you could‚Äôve made a text post. But instead you sent a screenshot and reply with ‚Äúmust be jealous of the rank‚Äù it clearly paints your picture to be an asshole. Probably just me tho
---
Must be a pretty new player cause against a seasoned killer no one escapes bubba's facecamp. He got greedy trying to get a chainsaw on someone that far away, easier to wait for them to try the unhook.
---
Agreed
---
ive had this happen when a killer let me wiggle while standing right next to the gate
---
He's matching their toxic energy. Taking out frustration. Not so much needing a win
---
I dunno. I think it‚Äôs pretty fitting that they‚Äôll release a chapter revolving around green puke during this time of year. 
---
Ok
---
It may just be luck but I feel that the killer I have queued tends to get more dailies. 
---
DED 'ARD.
---
Have a down vote! 
---
I mean, lag switchers are probably not too stoked about it. :\^)
---
As an Irishman I can confirm. Also am potato
---
Clearly not. 
---
You‚Äôre forgetting Spirit. 
---
You still gonna post that screenplay? Been looking forward to it.
---
Fuck them though eh.
---
Looks like the Doctor picked up a thing or two hanging out at the nurses station during his residency. 
---
Vommy Mommy is wonderful, thank you
---
r/politics
---
It's just that being mori'd after less than 5 minutes annoys survivors which is good. Games can be fun without giving victories to the survivors and playing killer isn't even fun all the times because of toxicness
---
He blinked right through it even after being stunned.
---
God level.
---
What
---
Aw shit, dude, I have to look at the screen and occasionally press a button?
---
And Borrowed Time too
---
It would be nice but with ever increasing cosmetics it might get a bit difficult to do all of that.
---
To add to other comments there are 5 totems.
---
My team got destroyed, but a Myers let me crawl to the exit gate. He even picked me up and carried me the rest of the way when he thought I was going to bleed out. 
---
Haha nice, yes it does, straight to the basement! XD
---
that‚Äôs the freddy rework they‚Äôve been teasing 
---
If you're blaming the killer for camping once a nearby exit gate is open, this is an open invitation to, as killer, leave a hooked survivor and start running around the map when the exit gates are open. I *challenge* you to try it. You won't- but if you do, see what happens. 
---
If you want to talk to him, talk to him at the end of the game but if you spammed Mori just for attention your a cunt
---
Not a bad idea. But then could that slow it down for people not capable of solving it quickly?
---
Son of a bitch. And here I thought Ace was supposed to make me lucky.
---
Serves him right
---
r/killedthecameraman 
---
lol it's fair enough, man. expansions are so overpriced for adding a minor gameplay feature
---
2nd time I‚Äôve seen this. Vommy mommy ftfw 
---
So fucking excited. Tired of lag deadhard and getting hit from across the map
---
Yea I think it was the lag in this case.
---
I wasn't near him whenever I got hit, and I wasn't near the exit 
---
It‚Äôs an ez win but it‚Äôs so fucking boring 
---
gg ez
---
What can i say? Every family has its problems
---
I didn't know that being in a chase stops the timer.
---
Learning something new everyday indeed.
---
Legion Legion members rise up
---
How do you "try to mori" ?
---
You mean you kept starting and canceling like an asshole? 
---
I think that's what you meant 
---
Don't be an asshole next time, I play against a couple of streamers I follow on twitch and play around knowing who they are aswell, I sometimes even play around in the chat asking "you want mori or no?" and things like that, but just doing what you just did is very disrespectful and no survivor wants to play against that. He is a streamer, but he's also a player like everyone else.
---
Absolutely. That is the whole point of it.
---
Done. Hey you will be able to say you have 1 person watching your stream which will be a first. It's a win win!
---
Since I haven't seen the rest of the game, I feel pretty bad for the leatherface. He seemed to be set on that petty kill and even as a facecamping leatherface, his target managed to get away
---
Yes this is exactly what I‚Äôm saying. People constantly talk badly about her but she‚Äôs definitely in the upper tiers for M1 killers. 
---
YOU...*slap*...ATE...*slap*...ALL..*slap*...THE...*slap*...CHOCOLATE CAKE!
---
I'm 100% cool with a DM. Have a good flight and drink a shit ton of coffee.
---
Boom. This.
---
Salt is what you should live for as a killer. Not saying that I tunnel and camp to get it but when you do get salt it tastes so good
---
Have never made one, but here's what a good killer bio would need:
---
- Name.
---
- Bio / background story.
---
- Power / ability (Description + stats / numbers).
---
- Perks (1, 2 and 3)(Name + Description + stats / numbers.

Sprint Burst is already the best exhaustion perk by default. I really just wish DH could be used while healthy so it's not so weak to exhaustion addons and instadowns.
---
It kinda looks like Joe‚Äôs cosmetic from Legion just needs a more milatrized helmet. Plus his knife is badass and I wish I had more shards to get it. 
---
he forgot to tie his shoes and the survivors wanna help
---
Dammit, well played. This gave me a good laugh 
---
I‚Äôll give it a shot. Does the difficulty on survivors effect your emblems during a match? I‚Äôve found my biggest issue is benevolent. I‚Äôm always getting iridescent during matches despite not getting hook saves or healing, it‚Äôs odd. 
---
When you finally get the P3 Claudette on a hook and then you facecamp then 
---
What's special here? 
---
No, go fuck yourself.

He was still a resident first, though. Besides, he didn't... exactly work at a hospital 
---
I Mean, I Just Say That If Someone Gets Out Through Hatch I Still Got A 4k, Just That One Of Them Got 5,000 Extra BP
---
Yes, at the highest level of play she isn‚Äôt very viable. But dbd is not a competitive game. We have completely broken killers like nurse, then utterly useless ones like Freddy. Most survivors, even at rank 1, make stupid mistakes and don‚Äôt play optimally, which makes even the worst killers viable somewhat
---
Definitely agree. She's no Billy or Nurse, but she sure beats the hell out Wraith, Trapper, Doctor, and the like.
---
About 30 seconds, I think 
---
Whoa, but what if it could disguise itself as a survivor too :o
---
I thinka survivor using the hatch should also count as a sacrifice for the killer. That way everyone wins, the survivor doesn't have to try powering gens in a hopeless match and the killer gets a bonus for outplaying their opponents. 
---
Survivors don't HAVE to run away from the killer either, but sometimes, it's the only option you have left to win.
---
I'm not saying that running away = camping, but all I saw in this clip was a leatherface trying to at least get 1 kill after the exit gates were opened
---
&gt; He never runs D-strike and is very vocal about it. Same with adrenaline, I believe.
---
...Again, so what? And he still does run meta perks regardless. So you saying he doesn't is just false
---
&gt; I never said, by the way, that it was unusual to have a bias
---
Oh please. You were framing it as a negative in your comment.
---
&gt; You were the one who had insinuated that he is not biased with the comment you made about him playing 50/50
---
lol no I didn't. I was just disputing that he's a killer main. He does have some bias for killer, but he's not some killer main who plays mostly killer
---
Where‚Äôs the 4 ebony Mori‚Äôs?
---
So often what ends up happening is that the killer does that just to lure out the last survivor and then kills them both. 
---
I'd be willing to bet my Reddit account that I average more twitch and YouTube views than you.
---
OH GOD FEüÜñ JUST RUN OH SHIT SHE HAS üÖ∞Ô∏èIRPODS ON SHE CAN'T HEAR US OH GOD
---
I'm tired of being blamed for that kinda shit
---
Holy shit. 
---
"hold on you got riiiggght here"
---
I ended up surprised when I played as a survivor for so long at first, and kept running into nice killers. Guys who'd let people farm if 1-2 people disconnected, generally pleasant types. Maybe I had a good run at low ranks.
---
Then I tried killer and holy shit it's a different experience.
---
WE NEED OLD MAN MYERS 
---
When you activate it and it goes on exhaust but you still get downed :,(
---
Yeah, I'm sure the player appreciates that. Sometimes they'll carry you to the exit though.
---
Wooo! 
---
Maybe that survivor he hooked really pissed him off, I'm talking T-bagging, flashlight wielding, decisive using levels of getting pissed off. I get tunnelvision from that too
---
The closer they bring solo survs to swf the better for balancing the game for everybody
---
Wowee Gud 
---
Technically, only Frank, Julie, and Joey are killers since Susie was forced by Frank to stab the guy. But still, at least we now have ***EdGy TeEnS***
---
The mistakes themselves are what make most killers viable at any rank. However, in the controlled condition that a top tier team vs a top tier Pig main, the Pig will probably skate by with 1-2 kills before the rest escape.
---
Never happens tough, at least not for me, I don't know why, but it just doesn't
---
I think it's extremely stupid to do alot of afking . Just play the game or don't.
---
You won't get banned but it's stupid. 
---
Rarely for me, since I main Billy.
---
Ah, well. It's rare. Good work anyway. 
---
Entity logic: Edgy teens&gt;Actual serial killers
---
She doesn't have map pressure because she's the slowest killer in the game when she's crouched, which you'll need to be in to sneak up on survivors. 
---
Seconded 
---
How is it wrong?
---
My lobbies were full almost everytime I play as a killer but goddamn the game is giving my people from another damn dimension as every single one of them had 150+ ping, like what is this, nobody plays in EU now?
---
Please dont let this meme come back...
---
Funny story about killer revenge, once I had two people dead and the other two managed to get the exit gate and were teabagging in front of me, so I just stood and waited eventually one of them got cocky and walked up to me, I downed him with NOED and hooked him and the other guy left instantly and I got a nice 3k. Let's just say that guy probably won't be teabagging people before he checks for NOED anymore.
---
They posted it for the world to see and comment on. If OP is happy with it and loves it; then that's great
---
That said, OP could have aimed way higher as far as both tattoo artists and art design are concerned.
---
Some things you can't control:
---
ISP fucking up every now and then and you cannot know at what time that happens (friend of mine has that issue and it makes for some silly DnD moments).
---
ISP generally just having issues with specific routing, so everyone could have a good connection but it could happen that the connection between you and the killer is just fucky.
---
Family members being jerks and using up bandwidth. You can't know how their situation looks, no reason for the guy not to play but rather for him to complain to that family member afterwards.
---
Nea practicing her mori on Spirit.
---
yeah it looks like its not bannable. i found this:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest
---
and it doesn't mention being afk as bannable. just botting, which i don't do. that's good!:) yes, normally afking would be boring. i do it a lot while doing other work on my computer. so it sort of acts as a nice companion to my work. the bloodpoints are usually pretty stale, like less than 8k a match. just a nice sort of work aide.
---
I guess im one cool cat (killer main)
---
Don't diss Franklin's. It's our only hope against Quadettes. 
---
YOU DIDN'T AGREE WITH ME AND PRAISE ME, YOU GET A DOWNVOTE!
---
Flashlighting at the pallet is a strategy to escape
---
Its more a matter of the act. The Entity wants people it can mold. Phillip (the Wraith) didn't do anything wrong. He had no idea. But he did go batshit insane upon realising it. The spirit only killed her dad. But she made a blood pact which gave the entity total reign over her for the sake of getting revenge on her father. Its not about the amount, or the person. Its about how that situation allows the Entity to take control, and force them into doing what he wishes. The more henious a crime, the easier it is for him to drag them in, but in the case of Legion, 4 teenagers murdering and effectively signing a blood oath together was enough. In truth, he only really dragged in Frank. The others wandered in by accident. 
---
"Lmao spirit just helped me killing dwight
---
That's the price of updated matchmaking aiming for faster lobby queues.
---
After playing on this Matchmaking System I noticed that the lobby ‚Äúgeolocation‚Äù is really wrong. As a Brazilian player, I saw I got a lot of red pings every match. Then, I started to look for the players location. I found Germans, Russians, Americans, but rarely found someone from Brazil or somewhere near.
---
The same thing happens as survivor and killer. 
---
We need more Dwight + David memes haha
---
So you've declined the challenge. Good. That makes me smile. 
---
*x-files theme*
---
Can tell you, first hand, that dropping that survivor into the hatch feels good man. It can also really cheer you up after a 3 escapes 1 down game, more than hooking.
---
It's the 4 vs 1 dynamic, it's easier to let yourself be a dick when you're high on adrenaline and with your friends. Also, there's some ironic fun out of subverting the supernatural-killer-versus-helpless-teen trope, so if you can teabag a guy trying to murder you and still survive, you're probably going to trym
---
Because DbD doesn't have short tier killers yet.
---
and leppy boi is a joke. Only good thing he'd bring is a Jennifer Anniston look alike survivor.

I could only find (https://imgur.com/gallery/GvV9Tu8) [a couple]

Help this bitch is crazy
---
r/everysubwhereyouexpressanopinionagainstthecirclejerk
---
I feel there is too big of a gap in gameplay experience between solo and swf that it makes this game difficult to balance 
---
The 360 on console is a thumb stick killer, good luck tho
---
Always felt like Claudettes ran faster
---
Not a very good one though, you can hear where the surv is running 90% of the time anyway, you're basically just HOPING that the killer runs the wrong way, in that time you could've just ran anyway and put more distance between you and him.
---
Really, the only thing you do is put a massive target on yourself with that.
---
I tried to do that once, that guy was real dense. He couldn't understand I was trying to help him even though I let him finished a couple of gens while behind him. Hatch then spawned and I tried carrying him there and he kept on escaping my grasp. He escaped me near hatch and ran from it, I was half expecting a message where he'd tell me "get rekt"
---
If only you didn‚Äôt just steal that memeü§îü§îü§î
---
&gt; Sounds like you don't know how to play pig if you're trying to stop people getting traps off.
---
It's not that you would want to stop them, but with only two boxes, it's going to take the survivor pretty much no time at all to get it off, which defeats the whole point of RBTs; slowing the game down. You lose three RBTs and the remaining one is only half as effective with only two Jigsaw boxes. You basically trade all the effectiveness of the Jigsaw Boxes for the ability to see people for 12m when crouching. I'm curious as to what purpose the trade-off would be worth it. In every game I have played with her so far, I feel like the reduced Jigsaw boxes and single RBT would have just made things more difficult.
