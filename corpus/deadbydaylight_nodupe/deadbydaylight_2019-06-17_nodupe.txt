People who say stuff like that don't make any sense, and it's frankly annoying
---
People actually do that?! Why?
---
I wish i could find games as survivor
---
Can't the xenomorph disguise as people in Alien?
---
At least he let you farm any points at all. Sometimes you just get picked off right at the start.
---
Not my stream loser lol

I was making a joke about his gas bombs, although given that they're described as a "tonic" and not poison, that was probably easy to miss.
---
What is the best way to report them?
---
I finally got evil incarnate just before doing prestige on Myers
---
Yesterday had a rank 15 game on Xbox where the killer ran an Ebony Mori (along with Hex:Ruin) as Hillybilly (best console killer) proceeds to Mori everyone despite all of us running blood point add-ons (but no Bloody Party Streamers). I was the last one left and of course he immediately finds hatch so I'm basically just dead at that point with two close gates.
---
Play killer, hook as much as possible try to 4K, abuse those rank 20 survivors who I can‚Äôt win more than 4 games with. (I‚Äôm new as well but killer is better for points it seems)
---
Same thing happened to me too, turns out my mom just left after she found out my dad was a neckbeard
---
Play killer. Maybe doctor
---
Should've used the in-game report as soon as the trial ended. Any way is a good way now. As long as you got the video.
---
Missed that part, thanks. Thought she just really hated her job.
---
play a lot and go for high point rewarding actions like unhooks and hex totem cleanses
---
4 man DC? So the killer DCed or did you at the end?
---
Better Noed at that point, it gives you info throughout the game and endgame kills
---
Oh yeah I did that but I figured that it doesn't do much. Where do I send the video?
---
This is fair, but so far all I‚Äôve encountered is gen rushers... I don‚Äôt camp but I will tunnel because I‚Äôve had some reaaaally short games during this event.
---
Yup. Update 3.0.0 along with Ghost Face should be released on all platforms Tuesday.
---
Oh it was right from the start, maybe a minute in. He let me take one person off the hook and as soon as they got off he used   his mori.
---
That's a good thing. If they do it in the loading screen the match gets cancelled and your BPS are returned to you.
---
At the start of the match would be bad.
---
That‚Äôs not really tunneling, that‚Äôs just being farmed by your teammate. Tunneling is not chasing any other survivor and focusing on a single player the entire match.
---
Just to clarify, breaking a pallet with Brutal Strength is as fast as it ever was.   
---
They removed a % from the Brutal Strength perk and added it to every killer's baseline.
---
The lullaby chapter is free, comes with David King(survivor) and the huntress (killer) 
---
Survivor side of things--
---
David King starts out with the perk "were going to live forever" which gives you a post game blood point bonus for saving your teammates or taking a hit for them as a distraction.
---
Killer side of things----
---
You can buy leather face dlc, and get his BBQ and chili perk (extremely powerful perk BTW) it gives you a token for each different survivor you hook, up to 4 tokens in total, which at max level (BBQ and chili level 3) gives 100% more post game bloodpoints. With this perk, when you hook someone it will show you all survivors outside a certain range, very useful for keeping momentum as a killer.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about playing a killer, the ones that farm the most points wise are legion and the doctor. The cannibal has a perk bbq and chili that is a bp farming machine and very useful in game.
---
Tuesday im pretty sure
---
I know but it's stupid
---
Got my points bruh. Just send in a ticket ic it happens to you
---
I feel bad for you. Your gramma so bad yo.
---
Chases and hooking since 2 I only hooked once and they die cuz endgame and noed
---
Maybe add a perk that speeds up certain actions If you're not within the killers terror radius? IDK. Or perhaps a perk that awards you with more BP the longer you are in the killers terror radius, including hook and downed times. It means that at least camping isn't a waste of BP
---
I AM OFFENDED REEEEEE
---
My God your so sensitive.
---
Why do you want it easier? You act like double pipping is the hardest thing in the world.
---
I‚Äôm trying to get adept piggy, but it‚Äôs proving to be a little difficult...
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôm not explaining how to do a glitch
---
Killer queues are ass on 2xBP, pick your poison.
---
Believe it or not, the bottom one survived too I think üòÇ
---
Wow, sad
---
Nothing wrong with it
---
Nah cause this is exactly how I picture everyone who uses noed
---
Or Springwood
---
I've played a bit of trapper, and you either put them in random but sneaky spots (in the grass right near a gen) or in "obvious" but bait heavy spots (like right on top of the killer shack pallet).
---
It's the sign of a good trapper that they put them in places you're likely to be forced to step into, not necessarily the sign of a bad survivor that you get forced to step into them.
---
A majority of people on this sub are survivors. Maybe the majority of people just downvote silly complaining and poorly thought out suggestions?
---
Can survivors hear Pig stand up and take out the blade? Pig main btw
---
Not exclusive to low rank killers, tunneling is simply the most effective strategy and camping can be viable depending on how the survivors react to it.
---
I don't like how if you're not winning, you're pretty much not doing anything. 
---
As killer: It's a casual game, but you can't play it casually without literally getting stopped in your tracks and, also literally, blinded all the time, before losing in actually four minutes and then usually insulted for it just to make SURE you had a bad time.
---
And don't even get me started on survivor. Survivor's even worse, you might just get to play, but you have to hope 4 other people are competent and well behaved, meaning most of the time...
---
It ain't happening.
---
So I guess at the end pf the day it's still the community.
---
It shouldv
---
Thanks for the response, will report it.
---
Oh no...The emblems. OH FUCK NO! PLS BHVR DONT TAKE MY RANK 20 EMBLEM. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thats how stupid it is. If anything its better to have their emblems and ranks high. Baby/New survivors are always easy to down and camp and you can probably get more at said ranks.
---
Yes you can define it as a legit strategy. But then anythings a strategy. But why would you punish those, who are being camped, for leaving in an experience that's only making them miserable. if it ruins everyones match besides the killers. Maybe we should make it so the killer has less of a desire to camp by ruining it???
---
The only thing I hate about it is that if someone dc'sor suicides on a hook you basically can't get it.
---
Sure gonna believe your not advertising with an alt account
---
This gets worse and worse with every event. It really is no fun any more. I think I played a total of 3 hours between pc and console since the event started. I will probably sit the next one out.
---
dont forget inviso-wraith standing 7 ft away from the hook and as soon as anyone enters his FOV hes banging that bell like a MF
---
''Cheap tactics''
---
Classic Rancor moment
---
What perk?
---
Which killer were you playing? Doctor?
---
Yep
---
Oh but I love saving all my mories for this events
---
Makes you toxic survivors salty :)
---
Had that happen today, ironically he couldn't catch me. Got out through the hatch
---
Nah fuck that, I just run and let the guy figure it out himself
---
I literally just looked up ‚ÄúAre pallets toxic?‚Äù and immediately found that. Also, it‚Äôs a meme, I‚Äôm not trying to make some incredibly accurate comment on the playerbase, I‚Äôm just making a joke about how everything is toxic.
---
deliverance = deliver ants
---
4 times with Wraith. Once with Hag and Myers. Congratulations brother. What is your next personal in game challenge?
---
Cool. That‚Äôs weird that I still have 50,594 bloodpoints and 695 shards in the PTB. Do they just give you these so you can try to make a build within the test server?
---
Lmao okay. I‚Äôm a killer main but go off. When I do play survivor I rarely ever complain about  camping or tunneling and I don‚Äôt care if someone uses a mori. But being an asshole and acting like you want to farm when  are just playing on using your mori is whack as fuck.
---
There have been a decent amount of times where I have hooked a survivor and then got DS'd by someone else because they were the only ones I could find or because there are only 2 survivors left.  
---
  
---
DS is in a good spot, but it shouldn't punish good killers who almost always have someone on the hook.
---
To level up ghost face when he comes
---
I do feel bad when someone unhooks when i'm basically *RIGHT FUCKING THERE* which happens from time to time. I play leatherface, so you know how that ends. I don't "tunnel" people, but if i see someone injured i'm far more likely to attack them. Depends on the situation, because chainsaw. If the healthy one is holding an item i'm far more likely to chase them instead.
---
But if i get the alert someone is unhooked and i'm close enough i'm going for them - and if i catch someone and they happen to be the injured one.. well they're going back on the hook. Not because i deliberately camped them to do that, but because i don't often get to choose which survivor i find at that point. 
---
If you just sit and camp one survivor the whole game, that's kinda lame and not even tactically wise. I'll swing by them as i patrol the nearest 2 gens typically, and sometimes that means coming by at the right time, and sometimes that buys the survivors enough time to cut them loose... that's just how it is.
---
An addendum to number 6, if you know the killer is going to be able to get to you before you can finish the unhooking animation rather than going for the hook immediately act like you are going to unhook but instead bait them into hitting you. During the weapon cleaning animation you will have enough time to unhook the survivor. This also is useful if you have Borrowed Time against a stealth killer as it will cause their heart beat to activate and thus allow Borrowed time to work. However, this is only recommend if you have perk than allows you to take a hit afterwards or avoid another hit afterwards (such as having Mettle of Man up, having Dead Hard and being capable with it, or potentially Borrowed Time or Decisive Strike on them if you can get them to do a protection hit for you).
---
Also, be aware that if the killer is bad they may not be aware that an unhooked person has a brief invulnerability period right after getting unhooked.
---
I would also recommend against basement saves especially against Leatherface (make sure to use hook pillar as obstacle or get in a locker to avoid getting chainsawed if you have to), Trapper (if in killer shack be aware they may have trapped killer shack window and it is really with multiple traps in the basement/stairs), Hag (make sure to crouch to avoid traps if so), and a few others. These can only be relatively safe with Dead Hard and Borrowed Time (from my experience), otherwise someone will just get hooked in the basement again most likely. 
---
This means there two natural protection periods of using the hooked person as a shield  (this will act as an obstacle hit for Leatherface by the way) and the moment invulnerability (both of which work against insta-downs). Plus any your perks or the unhooked person's perks give them, Borrowed Time is especially good during this event as it guarantees a safe unhook (as long as you can hear their heartbeat). Then there is Dead Hard /Mettle of Man as well as decisive strike potentially for the unhooked player.
---
Just use the giant tree in the middle 4head /s but actually u can do that
---
Yall missing the point, if a survivor takes you to a part of the map where all the gens are done and run you around and you let the game end because you refuse to give up
---
Umm i think bbq, nurse calling, ruin and destressing i think
---
More like i play enough to know that there are simpler ways.
---
Nice observation there sherlock
---
Yeah. Three more achievements to add to the to do list.
---
mettle of man, self care, balanced landing, adrenaline
---
I can't even remember the last time I used a Mori.
---
I'm fine with not winning every game or even getting one sacrifice but it's when I get the toxic assholes who teabag and flashlight click at the gate or when I'm struggling to get anything done because the framerate keeps dropping is when I get annoyed/pissed. Then here comes the 4 man group chat on how terrible I am.
---
Actually it's me and he's my buddy trying to troll me so calm down little bud!
---
When u impact font in 2019
---
Its fun tho! You cant be a killer mains if you dont have fun killing survivors
---
Aww how sweet op has many alt accounts to upvote his shitty stream
---
Adorable
---
Im still sad they nerfed nurses on doc that was a huge feature in his new kit with doc cube
---
40
---
Yeah :(
---
Who did you use?
---
I like this one a lot.
---
It was in the shrine a few months(?) ago, unlikely we'll see it again for a long time given how long we had to wait.
---
because it's the strongest perk in the game. it's even stronger if you take ds/deliverance instead of self care and just use a medkit instead
---
Leatherface literally costs the same amount as lunch, just buy him and grind him up with the double event, to answer your question though, BBQ has been in the shrine twice, and it was it was in the shrine a few weeks ago, it‚Äôll be a long time before it‚Äôs back again.
---
Oh i had no idea lmao
---
It was last on the shrine April 16th-23rd. Don't expect it anytime soon.
---
This made me laugh
---
You responded to a super old comment. 
---
But yes. He is pretty much the worst unless he has his best add ons. Bottom 3 without question.
---
I don‚Äôt really use them ever but I don‚Äôt mind if people do when i‚Äôm a survivor as long as they aren‚Äôt being an ass like this guy was.
---
Le exacting vengeance endlessly has arrived
---
imagine being such a tard you stay around to be toxic despite knowing you have rancor
---
Adorable....yes you are!
---
Ds selfcare adrenaline empathy
---
Self care is not included in the strongest build in the game. 
---
You can‚Äôt say something is the strongest build in the game and then follow it up with ‚Äúit‚Äôs even stronger if...‚Äù
---
that's not the point though
---
you lose everything when you prestige. perks, add ons, and offerings.
---
A perk that you can counter before it even comes into play?
---
Never said I didn‚Äôt I just don‚Äôt purposefully play like a dick.
---
Not sure how many people know this but I JUST LEARNED the tutorials give you BP
---
inb4 Rin gets most of her limbs cut off
---
You should note it‚Äôs a 1% chance per prestige. So nothing special. It‚Äôs more for the cosmetics than anything.
---
When you're hooked and all of your teammates are crouching
---
There's like, five of them. And they're easy to find, and don't take long to destroy.
---
It's completely counterable. Before it even comes into play. And you can still destroy it after it does? Or counter it with Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Mettle of Man, Deliverance &amp; Decisive Strike, maybe not getting caught in the first place?
---
I mean it's definitely a crutch perk but it's not OP.
---
People have such a fast and loose definition of tunneling, that it has no real meaning imo. You'll get accused of tunneling because you down someone regardless of how long it's been since they unhooked, just because they never decided to heal themselves or their teammates never healed them. Or they didn't evacuate the hook and the Killer decided to check the hook. Sometimes it will be that the rescuer dips the fuck out the minute they get the unhook, and the guy who just got off it will just linger around for whatever stupid reason.
---
Or sometimes they'll hop back onto the gen or totem right next to the hook they just got pulled off of, and get mad when you don't pretend you didn't see them there.
---
Sorry but not sorry. In any of those circumstances I don't really feel bad. And a majority of these are the times I actually get accused of tunneling, despite how absurd it is to consider it tunneling.
---
Oh don't do this to me I fall for it every SINGLE TIME
---
And that is godawful design. 
---
It's a killer achievement that is almost entirely in the hands of the survivor. DC, suicide, *if they flat out suck*, then the killer can't get the achievement. The killer is forced to extend chases, but not too long because you have to protect gens, but you also need at least 3 kills, but nothing to help slow down the game.
---
It's literally a terrible achievement now.
---
Well yeah but when you are by yourself against 1 killer, you can loop them and just work on gens while the 1 killer is being looped, with 2 killers looping is countered and they trap you, so staying as a group would be smarter. If both are being looped by different survivors nothing stops one of them going to help the other killer.
---
Something to add after my initial comment. Your first one is amazing. Though it would have to alert the killer via aura for 3/2/1 seconds. Your hook perk would be useless. There is a 4% chance to escape hooks without luck. Doubling that would make it a measly 8%.
---
For example, 8% means that if you tried to escape a hook every game, you would succeed 4 out of 25 times. 
---
That isn't worth a perk slot.
---
Example for an improved Anything Helps: While on a hook, sacrifice progress is stopped for 5/10/15 seconds whenever a generator is completed.
---
That still is pretty weak since most players will stop doing generators to save you. Also, most survivors aren't coordinated enough to time generator completion to help this perk.
---
Another example of an improvement: When on a hook, sacrifice progress is slowed by 5/10/15% whenever you are in the killer's terror radius for 5 seconds.
---
These are just quick spitballs and are in no way perfect. But I really like your first idea. It is balanced, has synergy with other locker perks even if it more or less a niche perk.
---
But bubba is a shitty m1 killer, as if that chainsaw has any use
---
If someone sits in lockers all game I‚Äôll point them out easily.
---
I love DHing a chainsaw hit. U give props to survivors who get me with it in chat as well.
---
Anything bubba does, Billy does better
---
They got tired of all the facecamping
---
15 minutes of fake time?
---
You sound like a crying 10 year old.
---
Ive been getting my BBQ stacks then just chasing survivors around. Nodding constantly. Hitting only healed survivors. Then let everyone escape. Easy
---
Genuinely, as a new player, Double BP helped a ton. I got Ace from Level 1 to 29 in 2 days.
---
Dedicated servers ain't gonna save you from your shitty Internet Dwight
---
It's the same speed as walking, and you can unlock the teachable and teach David urban evasion along with every other character. it's not even a good perk yknow. you wanna get good at chases and distracting the killer, not hiding and not doing shit
---
Wow this is truly an epic undertale gamer moment
---
I want this sooo bad. I‚Äôve been in a killer mood lately but the only way to play with my friend is to play survivor... would be really fun if we could both play together. Even if they just made it as a mode without BP or rank or something... so people wouldn‚Äôt take it so serious.
---
Outside of BBQ and Chili, your perks are not helpful. They only make you reach the in-game maximum sooner. They don't give more bonus BP to you so it's best to just play with a build that helps you do killer things. Keep BBQ though since it actually does help increase BP earned.
---
Do you know alot about ceting 10 year olds you sick fuck
---
They don't. This dude is just a dumbass who doesn't know anything
---
I did and it docked me for pretty much everything even sacrificed. It's stupid, I kicked a ton like 50 times I shocked and chased survivors it's nuts
---
Don‚Äôt talkt about it or they might change it too :D
---
Thank you. I agree with you on these changes. But for the original ‚ÄúAnything Helps‚Äù perk I think could be more powerful if it‚Äôs combined with slippery meat. But I like your version better
---
It might be hard to convince people to use it instead of party chat but I think it's a pretty cool idea, for randoms at least. Might not be widely used but it's not bad. Have an upvote

Idk how you're jumping to that conclusion, but ok

Your replies show someone who has a slight learning curve. Ar you ok?

This poll is kind of skewed, because the you asked people what their FAVORITE killers and least favorite were, you didn't give people a list and told them to check which ones they didn't and did like

At least you‚Äôre honest!

So what you're saying is the killer got greedy and got punished for it?  Comments like that will not be tolerated on this subreddit, killers can do no wrong

What does that have to do with your previous comment of saying a survivor wanting to play a regular match should DC?

The woman on the left‚Äôs shading reminded me of the Plague‚Äôs half-infected face

So let‚Äôs revert it to the old achievement.

Escaping easier than killing all four.

Not really proving a point here, boss.
---
No thats what you want
---
Mount and blade?
---
Why Clown though? He doesn't have the best deviousness gain.
---
Leveling up as a new player is great. Anything past mid ranks is a cesspool
---
This reddit is full of killer mains, what few survivors come here are constantly shut down. I don't know what reddit you've been on
---
Holy potatoes
---
You summed it up perfectly
---
Looks like you went for the unhook in the basement for someone your not in chat with.
---
Shouldn't do things like that . . .
---
Old DS was the best friend of extremely sweaty tryhard premed swf groups, and now, DS is the best friend of solo que survivors, who don't want get tunneled or farmed off the hook.
---
And I love you!!
---
Except double pipping is way harder than 4king. The point is the change made no sense, and with the way they've borked the ranking system it's really hard to pull off.
---
Spamming the Afterpiece I guess. I've gotten almost all clowns today. (I'm on console so that may affect the metrics)
---
That had to have been sarcastic.
---
that idea has been done a million times before
---
I love you too, bro!
---
Same! I love telling people gg or giving them tips if I noticed something I think I can help with but a lot of the community can be toxic as hell
---
I love sodomy
---
I love you as well!
---
you do know there are other survivors, right?
---
Don‚Äôt go off the original point. You said one sides achievement shouldn‚Äôt be harder than the others. 
---
Even with the old achievement (that you‚Äôre defending), it‚Äôs still harder than the survivor adept.
---
Cleansing every single god damn totem on the map is not reasonable, no.
---
Yes! Those stealthy ones always get me more often so spine chill saves the day against wraith and pig. Possibly Ghostface when hes released but we will see lol
---
The name checks out.
---
Oh there is? Didn‚Äôt know lol
---
Cancelled matches are supposed to return offerings now aren't they? Are you sure you lost it?
---
I love you 3000!
---
Kindred is a Claudette teachable, not a default fyi
---
I would agree if it was a base line in the game as an alternative objective, but it is not. It is tied to a perk.
---
I just hope they don't insta-nerf him when he is released, and they wait to players at red ranks figure him out. He seems like a viable killer at red ranks in the state he is now. Thats something good. Because if you aren't one of the top 3 killers and you go against red ranks swf with insta heals, if you don't tunnel or slug it's almost impossible to win...
---
What are you doing out of the forums retard ????
---
You can also fake tunnel people and then mori them for a spicy dying light. Tunnel a survivor and pick them up. if they DS you, use your mori. if not, put them back down to avoid being a dick.
---
Not really useful after the DS nerf but it doesn't work without it. you can just go after the obsession normally
---
That just looks like shading added to a character not really infection.
---
I still think it might‚Äôve been a nod to her. Either way it just reminded me of her baha
---
It's a well executed sabotage play. Not bad manners imo.
---
Yeah iri heads are bs, im a killer.
---
Well the first really isn't a toxic tunnel. If I have a choice between hitting the already injured survivor and a healthy one, ima hit the injured one to get em down
---
Than I can just chase down the other guy if they're nearby
---
Mh maybe. I'm on PS4 and haven't seen a single one, weird :D

30 and up. Yes, you need to lvl up the other killers to get those teachable perks on them

I don‚Äôt have a problem with him using a mori but how he went about it.
---
I play on PS4 and to take away from some of the frustration and ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù no matter what happens in the match I always go out of my way to say gg. It makes me feel less angry or frustrated when I get camped. Or looped as killer
---
No, survivors need to get rewarded, it's not fair to them, punishing killers isn't enough because killers only do it to grief, even if it gave them 0 bloodpoints they would still do it
---
I don't see why that's a bad thing any image can be used as meme formats buddy

If you do two hook per survivor, that would be 1200x4=4800 in sacrifice, a bit more than half possible. That would give a max of 28,800 BP earned, and multiply by 8 for the double BP event, BBQ, and 5 party streamers would give 230,400 possible max BP for the match.
---
Botany is the best general perk for healers, unless the killer has Sloppy butcher/ Thanatophobia/ other debuffs that slow healing, since autodidact charges up faster and works better with the lower healing speeds
---
I play leatherface as well most of the time, for BBQ to spend bloodpoints on my survivors, and I get a lot of disconnects even though I don't camp. I barely ever even use the basement lol. Using BBQ and watching for other survivors auras is such a great tool to know where to head next that it's not really worth staying around the hook unless you know someone is there. That being said, I definitely do make a beeline towards the hook if I see that someone has just been unhooked, and one or both of them usually goes down. Tracking people who leave scratch marks from an unhook is not camping or tunneling so don't let it bother you too much. Everyone just hates to go against leatherface. Even myself, I've learned to expect them to basement camp, so some people will start off a match against you already mad
---
Here's the thing and I'm saying this as a pig main
---
Amanda young is not the horror icon of her franchise.
---
it's reddit no one is going to listen to you
---
Not really.  You get more benefit from slugging said rescued one and then going after the one who saved them.. it takes 2 people out of the game, applies more pressure overall since now someone has to stop doing their generator to come pick them up.  If you just repeatedly hang the same guy, everyone on their team will just be like... welp.. guess ill just do gens.
---
"Is that the sound of my mother dying? Dad, please hold off killing me while I strip naked so I can be weeb bait DLC."
---
Honestly though. It's either keep getting looped on the pallet or break it and get a face full of flashlight
---
I never said that, that's someone else. What I'm saying is it should be changed back because it's waay too hard right now.
---
Thats not how you spell aight or ight
---
..ite
---
The gazebo buildings have open spots to drop and window rails you can vault to trigger it.
---
Does anyone know the source that this template came from?
---
I did that to this Dwight with his flashlight right by the exit gate. I didn't break the pallet. 
---
He tbagged but like... I have your green flashlight with the purple add ons, friend.
---
I‚Äôve had hillbilly games (using BBQ) where I would hook someone and immediately chainsaw across map, down someone and hook them, chainsaw to someone else, etc, and still got messages after saying I was camping and tunneling (I never tunnel, either, I like to try to give people a chance)
---
"Ikr, crazy survivors were all camping the hook!"

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._

Oh I generally slug the rescued one if it was a recent unhook. However if I chase the one and can't find the other right away I'll just toss the dying one on the closest inconvenient hook to get them out of the way in case they have unbreakable or their teammate stealth heals em
---
The color of the strips might edited by u/skeemo but It's originally from the Raining Blood outfit for Ghost Face. It was first found back when 3.0.0's dev build was dropped and then it has been officially announced as a Ghost Face cosmetic in the [3.0.0 Cosmetic Reveal](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68065/bookmark-cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-3-0-0#latest).
---
Shoulda vaulted that pallet when he vaulted the window into shack. Oh well tho you'll get em next game
---
Spine chill isn't """meta"""" but it's a good perk and commonly ran
---
What the hell bot
---
Who says I am gay?

De de de de dede de didid de de ded de dedededede dididididi

It's not the same with the red stripe down the center
---
Umm excuse me, my curiosity is sparkling. May I know what perk is on the right?
---
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GOT BORROWED TIME. Help a boy out. Lol, and then you just watch them get downed and think, ‚Äúwe could‚Äôve lost less had you got me.‚Äù üò¢
---
If these are players who don't know what to do around camping, OoO is FAR more likely to get them killed then help them. Other perks like Dark Sense or Premonition can reveal the killer camping, or DS could be recommended for protecting yourself after being camped.

That's... what I just... said...
---
Did even read the posts title?
---
We all know what happend, the Entitus, he snapped.
---
You mean the ONLY FUCKING EXPERIENCE OF THE EVENT?!
---
I'll tell you right now, because of how shit ghostface was in the ptb, everyone is incredibly scared and paranoid of any nerfs to him, and have a kneejerk reaction to it, because they don't want him to regress
---
üòÇ look at him hiding
---
you get a lot more rare items and offerings.
---
the difference between unprestiged and P1 isn't that significant but if you're levelling a P3 character you see a lot more rare stuff pop up
---
Doctor or legion earn the most deviousness bloodpoints, so I suggest playing on of those two. It‚Äôs also a good idea to bring barbecue and chili from leatherface if your playing killer. Or we‚Äôre going to live forever from David if your playing survivor. I play on Xbox too my username is Mediocre guy34 if you want to play sometime
---
Well I dont BBQ what's party streamers exactly
---
I don't think the timer remains active while dying, being chased or on a hook.
---
*tantrum noises*
---
Adred
---
Plague was likely not even a concept when Legion's addons were being made,  so I'm gonna give you a hard no on that one chie.
---
It's a common practice for the killer to check if there are survivors with flashlights before picking someone up the prevent them from saving their teammate, however that is the moment when the instaheal becomes an issue :)
---
like 0 TR, no red stain, and an insta down.
---
Bloody Party Streamers allow everyone to earn double XP.
---
That was very impressive.
---
Liberal tears , so refreshing.
---
They‚Äôve had the concept of the plague since *before* legion, actually
---
Well I love you 3001! Top that!
---
When did they say that? Not trying to be rude I just don't remember it.
---
Hey that's me! I DC every time I'm found! AMA
---
Get good at using balanced landing off the tree in the middle of shelterwoods and you have a great way to transistion from one pallet area to another one across the map.
---
Fair but still worth a shot.
---
Not if you‚Äôre sneaking? Lol.. No terror radius when using Night Shroud
---
I main nea and i usually have her neon blue shirt with neon hair and her blue skirt so you can see me a mile away which is more exciting. I see a lot of neon wearing survivors lol as long as they aren‚Äôt claudettes.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/well-yes-but-actually-no
---
Because somehow they haven't realized rank is meaningless.
---
Ohh, he might be me
---
What could *possibly* go wrong?
---
Unless night shroud was already active, they would probably know your coming, the others would work great though.
---
It hasn‚Äôt dropped yet
---
A slug build on nurse should use the following: Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Knockout, and Deerstalker.
---
Franklins Demise is a blessing
---
She must have tripped on one of Adam‚Äôs pebbles
---
The highest ive gotten is 43, and i got really lucky with the RNG chances and entity consumption
---
In a stream even before the Legion came out, Dave said that the ‚Äúkiller for chapter eleven will be the oldest in time‚Äù. Not saying that this means the concept of Adiris was fully done, but they plan ahead.
---
If you‚Äôre more of an aggressive player i‚Äôd go for legion.  If you like mind games and don‚Äôt have her i‚Äôd go for spirit.
---
Legit question - do you believe in aliens?
---
Dad jokes for father's day?
---
Level that killer up to 30 35 or 40 depending on perk. When you unlock the teachable it now has a chance to appear in other killers blood webs
---
It's not wrong, so how about you refrain from "bonehead" statements yourself? Good day, indeed.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest I thought OP was talking about dudes cosplaying as female killers.
---
Nurse is very bipolar - she's awful to play as unless you practice-practice-practice, but when you down someone it feels like you broke something. She's a breeze to play against, unless they've practiced.
---
Leatherface is... I mean his chainsaw hits terrain 99% of the time and is trash.
---
Spirit and Michael offer different types of gameplay, mixing stealth with being brutally in your face, which is why I imagine they performed well. Pig offers a better-Plague mechanic and decent stealth.
---
Thank you for the clear explanation,good luck surviving
---
[removed]
---
that's pretty messed up. I don't get why people get so salty as to ruin the game for others. I'm glad I haven't come across someone like that yet
---
It was just lag or lagswitching. No idea.
---
I salute you
---
Killer mains are in their own little world where they're outnumbered and bullied constantly.
---
same gonna get to 1 million for ghostface
---
That‚Äôs just shitty behavior
---
Quite a lot of perks don't affect Jigsaw boxes. God forbid we use perks that synergise with our power.
---
If you're not running Urban Evasion (particularly if the Hag uses extended trigger radius addons, which I think all Hags probably stockpile since IIRC they're uncommon) it can be pretty screwy.
---
Even a flashlight doesn't help against a decent Hag 'cause they see their set traps decrease so they can return to the hook *before* you even unhook. Alternatively you have to crouch away and she has plenty of time to make it back.
---
Not yet? Does it drop today
---
*oink*
---
Not sure, but you would have to know it's there. 
---
I've placed traps bellow windows mid chase in Haddonfield when I predicted a survivor would drop down too ...  But they wouldn't have jumped had they known. You're better off taking a hit than getting trapped.
---
True, just trying to find perks that go well with furtive chase
---
I'm gonna die
---
Cool
---
I‚Äôm mad and sad at people that use Huntress Lullaby because it doesn‚Äôt work with Jigsaw Boxes. 
---
Mad because I hate how they lack that particular knowledge.
---
Sad because I feel bad for them since it won‚Äôt work as intended for them.
---
Need any simpler way to address it (Not trying to be rude, sorry if I sound like I am)?
---
just because thats how mature works doesnt mean you have to like that animals are slowly eaten alive.
---
Well depending on the situation if you‚Äôre team isn‚Äôt doing anything to help I would try to escape then struggle for a 1 minute if my team doesn‚Äôt do anything I might just let myself die so I can go to the next trail but i normally play with a friend who just got the game a loves it and is really good at jukes first time he tried he did good so we work well together and escape
---
What about...
---
Hex: Windows Update. Hasty designs often interfere with what they were intended to aid, this automated tool increases survivor repair speed by 10% when they are unhooked for 60/50/40 seconds, but the next generator to be completed has a 10/20/30% chance of losing all progress instead.
---
*"Failure configuring Windows updates. Reverting changes. Do not turn off your computer."*
---
You brought this upon yourself *laughs in oink*
---
I find it worrying that not giving attention to antisemites and attempting to prevent/undo bias against disabled people is found to be a purely liberal viewpoint by you. Besides that, the OC did not even mention politics yet you insist that being against antisemitism and ableism is something only your political opposition does it's worth ridiculing? What I gather from this is that you are under the impression that the right is only for the hatefilled cancers of society, which may be why you joined? But let me assure you, you can still be rightwing and against antisemitism, racism, ableism, ageism and whatever else you can think of. You are simply a different, old fashioned breed.
---
Allow me to inform you, the Nazi Reich collapsed 70 years ago, give it up already.
---
I swear to god I'm bout to eat some bacon
---
My God you're triggered. Its pathetic and sad!
---
Or just get all the characters to 40 for their teachables still.
---
And _then_ prestige.
---
Atleast those maps all have hills and or cranes.

While I agree with your message, most neckbeards have autism which makes portraying it in this fashion a form of ableism. So... you know... I guess the devil has two names, one is me, one is thee.

PSN: MyShlongIsGiant
---
usually games where you start and immediately hear heartbeats aren't good, but this super chill legion farmed with us to the tune of like 80k so that was really just great
---
Can‚Äôt ghost face get you in instant down mode way faster than Myers? I thought it takes ghost 4 seconds
---
Or just play around it. It's pretty easy.
---
It looks way more difficult than just not doing generators and taking the hatch.
---
/s
---
Good idea thanks!
---
gonna try it rn
---
You're beyond help
---
that‚Äôs just your animalistic instinct talking
---
That doesn‚Äôt change the fact the dude is camping lmao.
---
I guess that's fair, I know that I have used some perk combos on my killers that I found out later that didn't work the way I expected.  I just make it out to be one of those live and learn topics.   I really don't see that many killers run lulaby these days aside from skill check doctor build that I get about once or twice every rank reset.
---
I think Legion doesn't enjoy being pulled into some fog realm, but one of their perks had the quote like:
---
"We're in too deep now.."
---
Spirit did nothing wrong either but her rage towards her father made her a great vessel for the Entity I guess.
---
been having some rough games lately and decided to play some killer today and a 4 man swf pops up all dressed up as ace in his tuxedo suit, load into a match to find them all crouched next to each other nodding there heads at me, we then just farmed the whole game but its matches like this that makes me love this game
---
To be fair, killers *are literally outnumbered*. 4 survivors, 1 killer. Killers make up 20% of the people playing the game.
---
Somebody wasn‚Äôt spanked growing up and it shows
---
Dead hard... lol.. ok
---
Same here. As Killer since last night literally every match has had at least 1 or more survivors (Alarmingly, usually 3.) just DC without the DC sound so I know it wasn't a ragequit. Last match as plague I had all four survivors DC at the same time. It's not a ragequit because there's no DC sound and it's not like I'm doing something asshole-ish like Iri Heads or facecamping leatherface. Hell it happens sometimes within the first 10 seconds or while I'm farming. 
---
I tried restarting my router, verifying game cache, IPconfig renew, release, DNSflush, etc. Nothing has fixed it.
---
You got proof?
---
Cross Console 
---
Sure i can see how this works, as i can see people dropping out on switch as many people will already have it on their primary rig and move back when the player base drops 
---
console x pc crossplay Maybe Limited times events, but its not worth the time and money business wise when we already know the camera mechanics are better than on console (FPS) 
---
this is why even people using devices that emulate a controller with keyboard and mouse on console are limited turn base wise
---
When someone is across the map dying abandoning a 50% gen is a waste. There is no guarantee that he won‚Äôt be hard camping you making my trip worthless and getting me down too..
---
Is it always the best idea to leave them on the hook. No, but there are situations.
---
Depends on your playstyle, when i wanna go off the meta ruin build i run BBQ, Surveillance, Pop Goes The Weasel, Play w/ Your Food, if i see the obsession i'll always frenzy hit even if injured to find other survivors and stay at full stacks.
---
Ohhh ok. I was just trying to get more perks because 5 times in a row it stopped appearing in my blood web
---
Seriously, they need toile it so it‚Äôll reveal the Perk if a Survivor fails a Skill Check or completes one when a token is earned to that Survivor. The way it reveals itself is why you don‚Äôt see it being used in top builds. And the worst part is that this has been gone unnoticed for almost 2 YEARS (DLC with Huntress originally released on July 27, 2017)!!!
---
.. Do people really think letting the killer get another hit/down in before they leave is toxic?
---
If they're right there it makes sense, she wasn't t-bagging. It's dbl bp weekend too, so every bit counts. She honestly seemed like she was trying to be nice.
---
Oh nice so there's 2x from the event, bbq, 2x one category from distressing, and one can dream of 5 bps.
---
ON FIRST HOOK? Where the killer was out an about doing his thing in the open, also, letting me die with a farming killer. They just started the gen when I got hooked, continued to work on it while ruin was STILL up, and let me fade all the way til I was sacrificed.
---
Stocks MEME 
---
STORKS
---
I see what you are saying to a degree but he does have a lot of side powers as well plus he can be used for mind games very well since you know he can have no red stain. chances are the devs will fix it because as of right now it does seem like a glitch cause his whole character is supposed to be sneaky. even if they fix it I think he will still be very good killer
---
As I've implied with my comment, I'm not a liberal.
---
Myers
---
Friendly killers hit random objects to tell surv they want to farm. Another way I signal is carrying a surv to the gen I want them to work and hit it a couple times before letting them off my shoulder.
---
There‚Äôs no need to whine about others gameplay strats or behavior. Yeah the game should be played as a team, but when you solo queue or party of 2, you should still expect the other randoms to do little to no work or not be as helpful as they should be. Which is why you should be more careful or run perks that will be useful in random lobbies like running Kindred so that way everyone can see where everyone‚Äôs at. Complaining that a person is on a gen is the most ridiculous thing to complain about. Be happy that a random is working on a gen. Most games I play randoms never work on shit. So take it with a grain of salt and move on.
---
Pinhead fs
---
Night Shroud Gets canceled by the following: Swinging your knife, swinging your knife at a survivor and hitting or missing them, and being seen. The No red stain mind games are strong but until you hit them or miss them or get seen. I want him to be a strong viable killer. Do you?
---
It does, but it just reduces the time for it to be used again. The way to use dh optimally is to only use it to make it safely to a window or pallet if you need a couple more feet without getting hit. Don't use it to outright dodge attacks from a killer.
---
You get way more points as killer if you hook someone multiple times.
---
I still think he will still be a very good killer even if the devs do fix it.  but fair enough opinion on if you think he will be bad with it fixed
---
LOL
---
Penny wise is an easy choice for me. I don‚Äôt know what his power or anything would be, and I know we already have the Clown, but seeing Pennywise in game? Terrifyingly awesome.

What why the regret I‚Äôve been on a role these past few days with legion they‚Äôre great
---
The bandages are a thing worn under geisha outfits like that, the issue is how it would perfectly remove the clothes but not them. Also Ash got taken NAKED and the entity put clothes on him.
---
Ok....
---
This guy would need a new profile after he saw.
---
I don‚Äôt think he will be bad, I only fear survivors that don‚Äôt know how to counter play him will complain to BHVR and get him an unneeded nerf he really doesn‚Äôt deserve.
---
Art the clown would be rad as well
---
fuck you right it was gg for me from the start of the game

I'd DC as soon as I saw him. I hate clowns. Especially him, the 80s version caused my hatred for them

---
Shitty killer, kills you every game. Run decisive strike, run an instant med kit, run mettle of man, play swf.
---
When you have full Blood Points
---
But realise you have unlocked all the Teachables on all Killers
---
And remember having to spend Millions Clearing the BloodWeb for BBQ 3 
---
SCREAMS INTENSIFIES
---
I assume it‚Äôs the same reason the nurse floats, the wraith‚Äôs face is twisted and the trapper has spikes in him. The entity did it.
---
Spirit or plague.
---
Killer version of survivors crouching across the entire map to save you from hook. The hate comes from the fact that in their head they think theyre being slick af boi. When they're not xD
---
Ghostface - Mid tier. We've seen stealth on killers like Pig and Wraith and stalking on Myers. Having to stalk almost a full Myers tier for every hit is gonna be a huge time waster. In the end he boils down to an M1 killer with an easily disabled power.
---
His perks? Might as well not even add them, they're never getting touched.
---
It'll get better as you rank up but yeah it sucks at low ranks. 
---
When I play killer my goal isn't to 4K - it's to get my 4 BBQ stacks and to try to apply pressure to everyone. Tunneling one survivor turns the game into Mechanic Simulator for everyone else and it's boring as fuck. 
---
I had a Myers today who tunneled me from 4 gens down till the exit gates were *open* because I was the obsession and he had Dying Light. It's such a trash tier perk.
---
unlock Ghostface perks
---
Use em all on michael 
---
Watch the survivors bitch post game
---
Big Booty Bill.
---
M'buse
---
Man, I just found out about the plague that shit sucks
---
It was just a guess from my side. I agree that we didn‚Äôt see any tea bagging but I can‚Äôt think of any other reason to stand there and wait for you
---
Nurses calling let's you see the aura of survivors healing nearby and make your choice, whenever a survivor is taken off the hook, whoever got them off the hook is exposed for 60 seconds
---
*Woah*, That's a VERY valid observation!
---
Wdym by hit random objects,as they watch you or as you chase them, and the generator idea is super smart
---
" I physically can't leave this rank "
---
This Man has ascended  
---
run a farming/hunter build 
---
enjoy the show
---
True but Killers have most of the power as a result and essentially control the flow of the game more than the Survivors can, with maybe the exception of a sweaty 4man SWF group.
---
Which killer has make your choice
---
I dont have ash so I'll have to wait for It to turn up in the shrine and none of my friends have this game so i cant play swf.
---
I'm trying to rank up, I really am but like, when getting tunneled, it's difficult to rank up. But yeah, o watch YouTubers at like rank 5 and stuff and I wish I was at that rank.
---
Ghostface- Low Mid Tier
---
His perks- Next to Wraiths if they dont get buffed
---
Yeah.
---
Ghostface is mid tier not bad anymore thanks to the buffs, he's still a M1 killer with a stealth and instadown so he's not the worst killer anymore but i wouldnt really play him unless i have a daily for him.
---
His perks are very situational and probably will be used sparingly they are game breaking...his perks are low tier...
---
If I've ascended then thats the worst ascension I've ever seen or been apart of lol.
---
F
---
Honestly I have 2500 hours in this game and still have yet to succeed in ‚Äúdrifting‚Äù midair. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible.
---
Joel or Ellie (since she'll be an adult in 2). Dont k keep a good killer from the universe though to make it a chapter. Dont think there is one unless somehow David was made into one
---
You should post it in r/dbdgonegay
---
Definitely. Hook everyone twice, slap a few people on the butt, and kick gens and you‚Äôll easily earn 20k a match.
---
I think he's top teir, you are downplaying his ability a little, streamers are doing pretty well with his ability and with ad ons it can make it almost in counterable. He will struggle at rank 1 but he should rip through the ranks no problem. His ability makes good killers who know how to mind game, amazing. I feel like we haven't seen his full potential yet
---
Boy do I have a killer that already exists in-game for you!
---
20k only? During the double BP?
---
Me earlier when I stepped in a bear trap while someone was already on a hook and then Trapper downed a third person. Then I look and see the final survivor all the way on the other edge of the map urban evading around the edges
---
Myers? Yeah, obviously. But I want ghostface e to be strong as well.
---
By being almost the exact same thing
---
You just gotta do everything you can. At lower ranks, even when I would die, I'd rank up cause I was doing everything - leading the killer around, saving others, doing gens. 
---
I know it's an obvious statement, but you just want to always be doing something.
---
Ghostface is a whole new ballgame.
---
Sometimes I You Font Even Need To Kill PeopleAs long  As You Do Your Duties As Gen Protector And Slapping People You Should Get BP.I Had A Game Where I Did All These Things And They All Escaped But Got 27k BP +2x BP
---
*taunts in oink*
---
He did have crows over his head, you can see it for a few frames. Either david was hiding in a locker for way too long, or he was just hiding and being unproductive.
---
I'm more inclined to believe Claud's in the right, it looks like this is from a spectators POV too so she probably had a friend guide her. I could be wrong though
---
Well it would be 60k. 20k each for match, double BP, and bbq.
---
Dont believe so
---
Why Enduring,Spirit Fury ?

Nah, it won't take long at all for survivors to learn to play against him. All you have to do is look at him and he's an M1 killer. How often do you see Pig coming, or even going after someone else. 4 people constantly looking around for a killer that only needs to be seen is still really mediocre for a power.
---
Tell me more
---
Man I haven‚Äôt even looked at the shrine in like a year, I‚Äôm too focused on blowing my shards on cosmetics
---
I knew it was a repost lmao
---
Ace is the quietest and has good stealthy cosmetics.
---
Survivors are doing better the more they play. Watch tru for example.
---
Spirit Is Fun Once You Know How To Track.
---
It‚Äôs That Feeling Of Outplaying The Fuck Out Of Someone, That Makes Me Main Her
---
"Only killer's can be toxic"
---
the fact he can get his stalk up in the middle of the chase it sorta goes against his whole character as there is a reason why he can go stealth and stalk and lean around walls. why would you ever do that if you can just insta  in a chase
---
Nah, even as a Killer focused player, it's a well played maneuver.  Id be upset but in a laughing way like "You little shits!"  xD
---
I thought you were gonna land in a trap when you vaulted down
---
Oink is not a escape
---
Because his ability is easily countered.
---
Pig
---
Do You Have Shattered Bloodline ?
---
When I tunnel I dont tunnel the guy who can loop and only drops pallets when he has too. No I tunnel the easy target to put pressure on the good players to save and not gen rush. I will repeat tunneling and being farmed off the hook are mostly caused by bad teams and that comes from someone who plays 80% or more solo surv.
---
The host doesn't make a difference, genius.
---
*Survivors that body block and teabag with MoM
---
*angry oinks*
---
mew think were cringey at first, then mew take the time to listen to her squeak. It all goes down hill after that first real listen
---
Can you do the Brady Brunch but with license killers?
---
Idk about on x box but on ps4 you can join the community and get into swf matches from there.
---
I already own them. Spirit does seem neat.
---
Damn
---
I'm not going to play KYF just because your feelings get hurt.
---
You're right, I'm still bad at looping so thanks for the advice.
---
Yes. I was using Freddy and got around 25k just hooking 2 of them one yesterday and this was without BBQ.  I did swipe and down many of them a lot of time but if it's David or Jake I didn't hook them.
---
No I don't, nor any perks from either Adam or Rin

---
it is not easily countered when he can instant down you during a chase. it makes all the other powers they worked hard on him useless to use.
---
Ok can‚Äôt argue with that.
---
Spirit is a good killer once you learn her. Plague is fun as hell vomiting on people.
---
Yeah just gotta hope its in the shrine
---
Yes it does, genius.
---
They never leave I don‚Äôt understand why
---
Oh yeah, survivor mains don't really like NOED, do they?
---
He would be Myers with 4 second stalk times if he stays as is now. I get there are some number changes with Myers, but it doesnt change the basis of their powers.
---
Eek eek eek I'll make that pig into bacon maybe then I'll enjoy it.
---
If You Play Killer Get Spirit She Has Decent Perks With A Nice Play-style I Main Her And She Can Outplay Someone HARD
---
IDK about Adam his perks seem great if you wanna be a team player but still wanna survive with deliverance
---
Can I have Dead Hard on? *( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)*
---
You're under arrest for assault of the oink Goddess
---
Golden. I‚Äôd give you an award if it didn‚Äôt cost money
---
you can hold onto them, you may want to spend a few if your playing before GF comes out.
---
There are some nice survivor mains. Alot of them are cunts. You had a cunt in your game.
---
Hit someone with the frenzy and if they smack you with a pallet you get the free down. Its the build i run and its pretty good imo
---
If you aren‚Äôt aware, people are already getting the hang of countering his ability by LOOKING AT HIM. It won‚Äôt effect instadown,  and no, it doesn‚Äôt make the other powers useless since he can mind game with night shroud me boy
---
\*makes someone get right up to hatch then closes it\*
---
\*lets them  get gate and escape\*
---
hahahaha im such a cunt hahahaha
---
Do you really think I should be under arrest for trying to eat trash?
---
Yes.
---
Adam with deliverance and dstrike seems like a good distraction to the killer. But I have more fun as said killer. I'll keep saving up for spirit, thanks!
---
Yeah it does, ghostface is probably the best killer for mind games as of right now since he ha son redstain or terror radius in nightshroud, Micheal loses the majority of his stealth capabilities in tier 2
---
I'm All Ears can go right to the bottom of the list with Monstrous Shrine and Beast of Prey
---
These are rly nice, what software did u use
---
I don‚Äôt play him like that I would keep Ruin and BBQ but with nurses and Sloppy Or Thanatophobia 
---
So Everyone‚Äôs wasting time mending and healing and not doing gems
---
So what‚Äôs the point in leaning around corners cause again he just like Myers right now can just run at you while stalking. I do not think that‚Äôs easily counted because your not just going to look at him when being chased. But fair enough
---
Ig cross play between console and PC was a separate option, maybe. I dont know if you've noticed, but PC players are much more powerful because of the unrestricted movement. That's why Nurses are so deadly on PC and so easy on console.
---
I like her perks but I don't think I would do well with her much. Does seem fun tho, I like her weapon the most out of all the killers.
---
Absolutely love this
---
remember old tinkerer it needed addons to work and it was useless on some killers but you could still use it on some builds and make it really good
---
Faster stalk process, and harder to be brought out of nightshroud me boy!
---
Which killers do you not have? Do you have all of the ones you can get with shards?
---
Both is a waste of time, unless dying survivor is so close to the hatch it would be fair for killer to close the hatch for safety.
---
Glad To Help And BTW Whenever You Vault A Window You Teleport There‚Äôs No Animation for it so you can kinda mind  fuck with that too
---
Not really. I know who Lebron James is, though.
---
So...
---
&gt;Nurse = Mr. Krabs
---
&gt;Plague = Bubble Bass
---
Am I in the ballpark?
---
I used to do that but after they nerfed or buffed whatever you consider it, its not as good as it used to be
---
Entity loves naked asian ladies?  
---
Entity is a weeb?
---
I'm missing clown, hag, dr, spirit and plague I think
---
So mew want it to be Myers with quicker stalk times and more stealth abilities just because ghostface doesnt speed up? That just makes Myers entirely useless. The only main difference would be add ons, but that cant affect what the basis of a power is when balance is concerned
---
Oh that's sick
---
Also many people look at him while being chased if you want evidence of what I‚Äôm saying, go watch some of true talents videos on his channel
---
Is it vengeance if the people you are killing have nothing to do with what you are taking revenge for?
---
I got mori‚Äôd three games in a row on ps4 and each killer messaged me ‚Äúeasy kill, uninstall.‚Äù at the start of the bloodpoints so the rest of the weekend I‚Äôve closed app on the load in screen if I see a secret offering.  I‚Äôm not wasting my time or offering and I‚Äôm saving the other survivors from a mori as well so it‚Äôs a win for me.
---
Can‚Äôt really see ppl bother with that when they can again just do it in a chase but fair enough opinion
---
After the Legion nerf goes live he‚Äôll probably be the worst killer perks and ability wise it‚Äôs still fun playing him at rank reset though.Sigh.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I just had a game where only one gen was done by me... and the other 3 guys idk dying in the hands of leatherface......
---
I would go for clown or spirit. Plague is pretty easy to use but it can get a little boring using her. Still a good killer.
---
20k normally, so 40k with double bp, and more if you‚Äôre using bbq and chili.
---
Micheal can have permanent instadown for all survivors if he chooses tombstone. It gives him more map pressure too, not to mention he can cut off loops faster than ghostface with the faster vault speed
---
Or when they close the hatch, refuse to hook you, and make you wait for EGC to kill you.
---
I‚Äôm all ears actually got a huge buff!
---
Hey if it makes you feel better I felt as if the pig was worth somebodys time
---
Their nerfing him again?
---
I mean it‚Äôs not so bad now but when Legion came out....
---
Dude,(Is there like a guidebook for this shit)
---
So mew ignored my entire last comment and took add ons into consideration.... good job. When you're concerned about the balance between two killers, mew have to look at their base power before their add ons. Add ons are something to be discussed after.
---
I'll save for spirit and then if I somehow end up with the shards again I'll get plague.
---
You can use addons to make it so survivors cant really pull you out of it, making him like a better Myers. Even with the counterplay you can do it back as long as you break line of sight. He doesn't need to be just seen, a certain portion of his body must be centered on your camera, so if you are just peaking a corner you can't be spotted from the front
---
This feels like some kind of hidden attack.
---
Bruh baby meg needs to use most op infinite, even more op with left behind
---
I love your style, they look fantastic!
---
I think it‚Äôs in the PTB I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs live though
---
Pretty sure the double bloodpoints events are the real life version of devour hope.
---
that almost never happens though
---
Can you just not spell you right or is your keyboard drunk? Also Ghostface can be countered easily, Myers can‚Äôt, there. I said it
---
It wouldn‚Äôt make Myers useless since he‚Äôs better than ghostface
---
Absolute gold.
---
No... I salute you
---
Uhhh. Myers is very easily counted. Just dont stand there. And thanks once again for ignoring my previous point. Really helping yourself out there.
---
And I changed my autocorrect to cat puns. Deal
---
I got 27k BP Just by using a 3 gen strat with spirit slapping people and kicking gens
---
The spirit also has some great teachables! Definitely worth saving.
---
Bbq, beast of prey, thrill of the hunt and distressing. Fills up quick.
---
Something the pig cannot do
---
Oh okay, I don‚Äôt even know what your previous point was if you‚Äôd like typing it again
---
This entire game is that so nothing has changed.
---
I am preparing an assault. Calling all Oinkers
---
The story of spirit matches little bit with the story of Slasher in Durarara anime although the child live in it to tell the tale. Even the visual of kitina coming out are similar(not exact copy). In anime the family own a antique shop got a demonic kitina. Wife was controlled by that sword and used to slash people and called the slasher. Father was in debt with mafia and became drug addicts. Then tries to kill there daughter, mother tries to protect and use saika(demonic kitina) power to kill the father and then kill herself. Now the daughter possess the demonic sword. The sword is hidden inside the body of its owner.
---
Kate and Micheal.
---
Also Michael is my favourite to go against. He genuinely still scares me after all this time and his power is well balanced and fun to play against.
---
Empathy for animals being slowly killed by way of being eaten alive is an animalistic instinct?
---
I Once Hot A Game Where I Got 8000 On Everything Except Brutality (They Were Very Altruistic And Got A Hard 4K)
---
Adept plague was hell to get at low ranks so I had to wait for reset to get it, even then, I either hardly got kills and failed to get merciless or stomped them and....failed to get merciless. I had to get really lucky, the 4 kills requirement is a much better achievement.
---
Only once did I ever get 8K in all 4 categories. It was glorious, lol.
---
Patrick stop! You‚Äôre trying to talk sense to a killer main!
---
What they changing
---
Ok.
---
i do it when I'm being nice
---
You know this chain made my day thank you that's the only thing I'll give the oinkers
---
It's a widdle Bubba playing in,his basement! ^w^
---
Much fear, very scared, such vengence
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs old but if you miss an attack while in frenzy it‚Äôll go away
---
I'm running Spine Chill, DS and Sprint Burst all to just try and not be the first one found and then tunnelled or farmed off the hook. The combo of double bp and reset sure has been interesting.
---
Haha. No pawblem. It was a nice escape from the normal toxic conversations of the dead by daylight subreddit
---
Thats already live
---
This is true in some (but not all) situations.
---
You cant understand if you arent a pathetic toxic piece of shit
---
Really I Swear I Missed An Attack Yesterday WTF
---
What they alter, I haven't played the new PTB cause of Bloodhunt
---
as a killer main, i just do stuff. They do the gen a bit, i damage it, they do it more, i damage it, etc. I chase them. I hit them once, let them get healed, hit them, sometimes they let me hook them. I let them pallet stun me and blind me :P. When i play surv though, i get camped and tunneled.
---
I was doing ok...but after 3 insta heals, i have lost the willpower to play this game anymore today
---
The fact that the only difference between Nyers and ghostface right now is numbers. If it isnt fixed, it stays that way. Ghostface stalks faster and Myers is faster after he stalks. However, 4 second stalk is much more valuable than some faster speeds and a better lunge
---
Yep. Been live for a whiiiile
---
You ruined it with pawblem what is their a dog killer now? Johnny are his salad supper then bacon dog
---
I've gotten nearly 200 Bloodwebs completed with all the BP I've gotten.  Sadly seems most players don't want to use or dont have anymore Bloody Party Streamers for insane BP xP., Still, averaging between 60k-120k BP depending on what Killer/Perks and the map/Survivors I get matched with.  I do wish these BP gains were what we'd get normally tbh xP
---
I tried I was so bad but also Larry‚Äôs stupid ass place
---
Yeah their powers are VERY similar. Tired yet again, sowwy.  I agree to an extent on Myers would be useless compared to ghostface since ghostface has all the other stuff going for him and Myers has, well, instadown... yeah. But many people consider Myers better still even though ghostface is probably better
---
Maybe hope plus adrenaline, adrenaline heals you one hit while Noed strips one hit, hope is a speed boost equal to noeds, so maybe they should combine Hope and Adrenaline and get a true opposite? Hardly ever see anyone use hope
---
Yea, it is pretty much the best exhaustion perk.
---
I always had killers who would hit me down, pick me up, let me wiggle out, and hit me down again till EGC kill. 3 minutes of that is delightful.
---
My brother
---
This is beyond SCIENCE
---
may the entity have mercy
---
Haha. I have an ongoing joke with my friends where I'm constantly pinning. Cat puns tend to be my most common ones, so I changed my autocorrect to fit it
---
*rolls eyes*
---
If the killer found the survivor next to the hatch and actually looking for them that is fair game. I agree.
---
Wow I didn't even get the animal right.
---
 [https://twitter.com/\_SrPelo\_/status/1134628489473273858](https://twitter.com/_SrPelo_/status/1134628489473273858)  you didn't make this. don't take credit for other people's work
---
1 purple is the max I think. 
---
1 brown + 1 yellow = 1 purple
---
It's really not noticeable and has been more,or less debunked.  Only prestige if you want the Bloody Clothes and Trophies/Achievements associated with Prestigeing...otherwise it's a HUGE time and Bloodpoint waster.....
---
Man where are you when I need a good killer. This event has left me exhausted.
---
I agree with that. I think when Ghosty drops he will be respected amongst the killers and be high mid tier to mid mid tier
---
Like mew mentioned before. Myers add ons are much more powerful than ghostfaces. But when it comes down to their base power, ghostface is much more powerful than Myers. I guess it really depends on your perspective, but I tend to look st it from a game design perspective, which is where their base powers means more than their add ons.
---
I give hatch if they don't struggle because the power is mine.
---
Oh of course. If recent rescue is rank 20 can't loop to save their life Ace and the rescuer is Rank 5 super stealthy Claudette who's done like 2 gens themself ima get that Claudette dead
---
However if it's a matter of getting a quick sacrifice early game (or even just a hook progression) I'm gonna go for what's gonna help me in the long run
---
And of course you know that the rescuer is most likely going to stay nearby to re-rescue as soon as I walk away so I've still got 2 people off gens
---
Hahaha
---
Okay, so i was playing dbd with a friend and using my phone and i wanted to screenshot that i got a silver medal to show to my friend and i got a notification and in an attempt to click it i pressed the options of the post, so i tried to click outside the options to close it but accidentally pressed on the delete option because i was looking at the game, when i look at the screen of my phone i see the pop-up to make sure i want to delete the post and because i wasn't paying to much attention i had like a small panic atack and was like "OhShitNoNoNoNoNo" and without even thinking press on the delete button instead of cancel and now i wanna cry in a corner because i feel like shit specially because of that one person who gave me my first medal
---
I feel the pain.
---
Although there isn't any real "playing fair". That's really just subjective/abstract rules. The game has items so people will use them. Same with killer iridescent items. 
---
I still wish you could get extra BP when facing SWF though.
---
Yeah I figured that
---
it is 100 percent because that is the release date
---
Lol expose him
---
Been live since the mid chapter patch
---
Add ons can change a killers power drastically, but I agree with this entire comment. Yet again, kinda tired from being at the beach, o h yeah, forget to mention I was at the beach for a week, heh heh. Anyway yeah, ghost has better ability, Mikey better add ons. But what about their perks? Wat be your opinion on those
---
Jokes on us in Australia and Nz apparently, 200 to SG will be the best we get lol.... despite how mind bogglingly simple it is to host shit in cloud providers in any country.
---
Just fuckin kill me man, I know I‚Äôm stupid
---
Yeah it's kinda dumb how Adepts for Killers are...like as Survivor you can bring a key, have SWF, hide most of the match and get it...David's Adept is the only "tough" one because of No Mither making you a HUGE target.  The Killers often have crap Perks that do very little to even give you a chance to 4k,,let alone Double Pip, esp with how the emblem system is...
---
I finally got all the nurse unlockable perks.
---
Someone did this to me to troll, but I had adrenaline and a key, great feeling.
---
OP going for the double-dip karma
---
Hiking and mountain driving?
---
Any fast vault within 48 meters will be alerted
---
Awww that sucks and yeah I figured that
---
Until the survivor has a key
---
Exactly! It's all about who's not on gens. If you have one guy hooked and one guy teabagging fifteen meters away from the hook, you can reasonably guess that another guy's nearby to rescue.
---
So stay.
---
I'm a feng min main on the survivor side.  As far as killers I like playing against...Its prolly tied for me between spirit, plague and [a good] trapper who can mind game survivors into going where he wants you to (into traps).  Spirit players tend to be more consistently compelling to play against though so I'll prolly go with her.
---
I dont play killer very often so I only have the base set.  As such I usually just stick with trapper as I find hillbilly and the doctor infuriating (and cheap) to play against and I dont want to put in the time to learn nurse.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
So basically it can counter Quick and Quiet or other people fast vaulting near you while in a chase
---
Part 1: accepting your death
---
Honestly, dont really like any of their perks. Individually, I'd say it depends on your playstyle if they're any good. As a perk group (if you're playing the three mew need for the achievement), Ghostfaces are better for the soul fact that they don't contradict like Myers do.
---
Give him his tank top from his appearance in Payday while you‚Äôre at it
---
I Hope My Updoot Makes You Fell Better
---
Yeah, his perks actually kind of work for him, unlike Myers,
---
Nah man I should go after the tea bagging guy cuz if I don't I'm a toxic bad camper! /s
---
But seriously I've gotten messages after matches because I wasn't dumb and left the hook to chase an obvious bait
---
If I know I at least have my safety pip and they played a good game I'll usually let the last alive go...preferably by dropping them at the open exit downed and letting them limp out.
---
Eh, if you all farmed and he only mori'd at the end/once BPs were maxed...I cant really get behind being upset or frazzled over it (of I'm reading this right)  using a Mori and immediately killing someone once they were unhooked,,yeah that I can get behind being upset at
---
This was quite the interesting turn around in conversation...
---
How long is the aura reading? It could be ok for mind games in that case
---
Skyrocket it up to mid tier
---
Le Spirit Lore has arrived
---
That's an addon for the map item that lets survivors place those beacons
---
I miss the days of darkening the moonlight *Not a Claudette user I despise her*
---
Don‚Äôt quote me on this but around 4-5 seconds I think
---
I've seen this happen before and I just tunnel the person who pointed
---
It was
---
This is a typical 4 man SWF
---
When the you think you are safe from the shooter but he has noed
---
Yes
---
God please let us report this shit
---
Camping is so boring. I have pet peeves with survivors too like the ones always hiding in lockers when people are on the hook. And the killer is on the other side of the map. Or look through a chest.
---
I almost ALWAYS and chased after a killer hits someone once if I‚Äôm next to them. They won‚Äôt even down that survivor, but instead just come for me until they down my ass.
---
Wataten!
---
Indeed indeed, Anyway, will you be picking up WAZZUP boi the day he drops?
---
You never lose bloodpoints without spending them. You can also have 3 completed daily rituals ready to accept once you've spent points, and iridescent shards to buy duplicate teachables off the shrine for points.
---
Not his, he tried stealing it from a well known artist, Sir Pelo
---
Wut?
---
Looks like my cock
---
Most likely. I want to platinum the game and I'm super close. Plus I just like messing with new killers.
---
I‚Äôm all ears got a massive buff
---
???
---
If you're rank 16...
---
I'm going to have some feedback that might make you.pissed. 
---
You're probably not playing well and your teammates are potatoes too. A killer will see **very** obvious survivor activity that leads right back to you. As a killer there is no reason not to redown someone. At that ranks survivors don't really know what a safe unhook is and the killer has a very easy time.
---
I strongly recommend running Decisive Strike and Kindred if this is really giving you a problem.
---
Memes should be outlawed.
---
Ehat happened to 101?
---
__Not rude but as a killer as you long as you don't t-bag after it's just kinda like "oh okay..."__
---
Me too, I WEELY WANNA TAKE SELFIES WITH CLAUD!!!!!!
---
because your country is already scary enough
---
ebic roast gottem
---
Same though
---
Well for starters Survivors don't have to double pip to earn their adepts so there's that. Also if they DC they can deny you your pips as well as you purposely have to stall out the game longer to maximize your emblems.
---
gen grabber spirit should be outlawed.
---
A salty Spirit did that to me a couple of weeks ago. I don‚Äôt expect a free escape, but just hook me and get it over with so we can both move on to the next game.
---
Best Mori in the game tho?
---
God has entered
---
Honestly yeah, that does sound like a cool idea...also, the bloodpoint gains for survivor are generally way lower than killer, but that's a different discussion.
---
I dc because another player DC's or because it says he has green ping but then I'm teleporting all over the place with hay dumb lag.
---
Definetly. I dont know if anything can top it at this point
---
God didn‚Äôt help us win :(
---
R.I.P Feng Min You Will Be Missed
---
Dont show this to BHVR or theyll misunderstand it and do something crazy.
---
Maybe it's because you're a bad survivor and should learn how to cleanse totems. Or don't get caught once the last gen is done. Honestly, I've never seen NOED turn around a game from a 0k to a 4k that quickly. I've seen over-altruistic teams play right into a camping killer with NOED, but I've never seen a killer completely turn the game around because of it.
---
This is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen this meme used with a bait and switch and it‚Äôs actually kinda good. Normally this meme is trash but well played
---
Lol, now I know there are actually people that think that
---
Lol this isn't even your work! You should be ashamed smh
---
Myers is being nerfed due to being way too much fun to this game
---
We want a scary game
---
killer exhaustion perks, im tellin ya
---
Kinda. They are kind of weak in some regards, and there is a significant amount of pressure from survivors to make them as weak as possible and being easily bullied by survivors. Thankfully devs have done things to mitigate that lately, mostly nerfing a lot of survivor perks like Decisive Strike and improving pallet loops in favor of the killer.
---
I wouldn't mind it so much in a normal match...but all of mine have been with 3 BPS's being burned
---
Everything else is just plain death and morbid, his is just funny, like watching a blonde chick with big tits get mutilated
---
we're gonna die forever*
---
Don't worry you won't lose any bloodpoints granted you haven't spent any. You can spend around 100-200k before the 18th so you can quickly build them back up.
---
I'm happy it is funny too. It fits the theme of him
---
Gross I hate when people do that. Thanks for crediting the real artist
---
Damn, I feel used. Shame on you, OP.
---
spreading misinformation has nothing to do with your intent, even if you believed it was true, you were still doing it
---
Welome
---
I played Survivor today running Kindred, Bond, Open Handed, and Borrowed Time.
---
My first game I got hooked first and all 3 Survivors just crouched around the hook while the Killer camped me.
---
The games didn't really get better after that; at least 3 games ended with Killers DC'ing as soon as all the generators were powered, 2 gamessaw a Survivor DC before the 1st gen, and 1 game I got sandbagged to death by a Claudette who told me to "get a life" completely out of the blue AFAIK through a 'friend' request.
---
I did get to keep a Skeleton Key I looted from a chest one game tho, (w/o Plunderer's) so it wasn't **all** bad.
---
Yeah I'm not the type to get upset because I didn't get my free points. I also don't get it because you're wasting your own time too so what's the point?
---
Honestly after the 4th time of that I tab out and watch videos.
---
bro am I bro
---
Hmm teabagging isnt funny too Ur when the wild niggattesses wann‚Äôs get there stacks right After i hooked someone they are experiencing a awesome facecamp + Tunnel in worst case
---
Usually the killer isn't even close, just the slightest heartbeat.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what OP said, that‚Äôs the nice thing to do because it gives the killer more points for hitting you
---
Claudette and Hag.
---
And no, I'm not a toxic Claudette I swear. Shes P3 but I have cosmetics from the store that I use.
---
I like going against Myers honestly. Hes not too hard but not too easy. Hate trapper. After 300 hours his traps still get me
---
Wow and I was just about to compliment it to, thanks for the warning
---
I get so mad when the entity takes my browns many
---
uuhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
shut up! &gt;:(
---
***makes angry spirit noises at you***
---
Well they can use that in injured but not the dying state so the key is useless in this kinda scenario. It is funny for the salt when they get mad you opened it back up.
---
Sociopath is the disorder you develope through childhood trauma and or abuse, psychopath is mostly through genetics and other shit like that.
---
Welcome
---
How does that help him in a loop exactly?
---
Man you had it good. I'm sure they were pretty butthurt about it later.
---
If you're getting facecamped, why aren't your teammates getting the generators?
---
Yea.
---
It can pretty easily extend a chase for a lot longer than normal by covering up a mistake.
---
2edgy4me
---
Oh man trapper can be really annoying. After all this time I still end up triggering the dumbest traps placed in the most random places.
---
I know. I had a game earlier where I was on dead hook and the only one left in the game. Sprinting across the map to make it to an open door and stepped in a random trap in the middle of the map. It's the worst feeling ever
---
This is every Bloodhunt idk why people are so surprised.
---
I'm a Dwight main who plays on console and LOVES to go against nurses and Myers.
---
The amount of times my stupid ass has seen a teammate pointing and been like "Oh, you want me to run that way?" is astounding. Literally ran face first into a billy chainsaw last night
---
i noticed it was sr pelo's art style. and.... this was theft. damn
---
SHhhhhhhh!
---
I mean yeah.
---
Even in the absolute improbable worst case scenario where they (somehow) get charged for first-degree murder collectively and equally despite no evidence of actual foul play or criminal intent (which is basically impossible in modern day) and were all executed.
---
...It'd still be better than what Dwight is going through.
---
he stole it from sr pelo :(
---
I will sacrifice my own life if it means the baby meg escapes 100/100 times
---
I know your pain...lot,of SWF using Farm and Yamaoka offerings with Instant Heals and suped up Toolboxes and I'm just going "why...its BP weekend"
---
Like fine, you dont need to farm or throw yourselves at the Killer...but goodness, some people xP
---
Hag and Kate.
---
Nothing beats hitting someone right after they trigger a trap running to new pallet. Or faking a pickup to bait a pallet stun.
---
Kate, I just really like her sleeve I guess.
---
i like to keep survivors to their unique perks or stereotypes i guess if their perks dont suck
---
nea has balanced and urban evasion 
---
dwight has leader, prove thyself and bond
---
claudette keeps on empathy 
---
jake is my sabo guy
---
meg uses sprint burst an adrenaline 
---
i alternate the left over perk slots with adrenaline, self care, plunderers instinct, borrowed time and dark sense, depending on how i like to play that character. right now meg and nea are my mosy effective survivors.
---
For Survivors I main Quentin and Nea (beanie squad), and for Killers I main Huntress and Legion.
---
My favorite Killers to face are Michael and Hillbilly. They're able to keep the game scary and tense: Michael by being sneaky and having so many potential builds that you're always a bit on edge and Hillbilly because he's mobile enough that you're never safe and always have to stay alert.
---
Bold of you to think a Baby Meg thinks that much before they start sprint bursting away. The plan isn't "distract so claudy can unhook," the plan is "HOLY FUCK RUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNN"
---
Franklin's is fine if Survivors are bringing in,instant heals and Toolboxes tbh...
---
Can I report my own post so the comments will stop talking about Alt-Left bullshit?
---
Plunderers
---
A perkless myers is pretty easy
---
Noob stompers
---
I think the stalking/instadown portion of his power is gonna really not work once survivors learn to just look at him. However, having full speed no terror radius is huge and will let you get the jump on people pretty well if you don't try to stalk and just run in for a grab/hit. I call this potential strategy "Battle Face".
---
As for the perks....
---
I'm All Ears is actually pretty decent now. It'll help prevent "Where the fuck did they go!?" situations. I'll prob use. Thrilling Tremors is really ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, and I love the obsession-swapping mechanic of Furtive Chase but I wish it had a different effect.
---
You're pretty late, that's literally him now
---
This guy right here gets it, baby megs are super cute and wholesome. They must be protected at all costs
---
I've been enjoying Dance With Me, Lithe, Quick and Quiet, and Adrenaline lately.
---
the biggest concern is did you have exactly 840k bloodpoints before the match or did a good chunk of those earned points go to waste?
---
Lol that is truly unfortunate, I always assume they are pointing towards a killer or telling me they are that way
---
Good question actually, i don't know

Is there still a reduction penalty wiyh lullaby?
---
Billy did it for love.
---
I guess all survivors just know he's there 24/7 and need no indication of him coming, I forget all red ranks are pros and omnipotent.
---
I like how this came down to you just saying how shit he is when I'm trying to point out that he's a strong solid killer.
---
For survivors I used to main nea but now I main the holy Jesus. I don't have a killer main, I play and enjoy all killers.
---
My favorite killer to go against is nurse. I love trying to mind game and juke each other. Hell even if I on these super rare occasions get a God nurse, really enjoy the match
---
A shooter with NOED?
---
Deathgarden and Dead by Daylight crossover event confirmed?
---
Yah don‚Äôt blame you, if the killers wanna be a bunch of asshole scumbags we can fight back against it! Been playing tonight and man it‚Äôs been a circus! But I also have had some decent games with good decent non camping tunneling killers who got 4s without camping or tunneled and we all made allot of points! 
---
Ty to the killers who make the game fun!!! 
---
FUCK YOU TO THE REST!
---
It's an exploit that we're not supposed to share or advertise though.
---
Hopefully BHVR fixes it, in fact is there a place to report bugs? Hmm.
---
It's Xbox, everybody has been lobotomized, and that's coming from a Xbox player.
---
Bro you better be bro
---
Is there a problem here?
---
Completely agree but I hate going against 10 Michaels in a row. He is to console what Nurse is to PC LOL
---
Me: *I'M GONNA SAY THE N-WORD!*
---
Find the hatch, is one way. But the gates are always far enough to where if the killer is patrolling once they leave you can get it open. Happened to me twice today. I'm patrolling and no progress on a switch, I go to the other and as soon as I come back the person was just opening the gate when they came into view.
---
I am bhro
---
Thanks for the feedback. I do realize I am crap at the game and I try but yea, I normally rn DS and I'll try running kindred next
---
Actually it goes to [Mudmallow](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7y8wm7/when_a_pig_walks_up_to_you_and_you_think_its_just/?utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=deadbydaylight&amp;utm_content=t1_erbzx1g)
---
Maybe something fair is that if traps are applied when the doors are powered, they won‚Äôt have a timer, but will still go off if you try to leave with it.
---
Honestly! When I play a match it‚Äôs usually to rank up. I tell myself every time, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to escape to rank up.‚Äù So it‚Äôs usually just doing what I can to help my team escape. Escaping doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything lol
---
Exactly I don‚Äôt mind being mori‚Äôd but to message after I‚Äôve already left the game and joined a new one to tell me I‚Äôm trash and uninstall is a bit much. It‚Äôs to the point where I really feel like closing app on anyone who brings a mori after that. I actually had a few good games myself where I died but the killer wasn‚Äôt tunneling or try hard. I got over 100,000 bloodpoints and they did too. It was a nice ending!
---
The top tiers come with map pressure on top of the ability to end chases quickly. All GF has is stalk management and mindgames. Can't see him being past Shape which really isn't a bad spot to be in.
---
I main hag and nothing drives me nuts more than playing survivor with people who don't know how to go against her.  I've said it before but I wish there was some sort of mentoring system with this game.
---
Better buckle up because the oinkers are gonna come for your blood.
---
*Screeches War Oink*
---
As a former Meg main, I‚Äôm just running Spine Chill and getting to f outta there because Stalky Boi is around
---
All they had to do was make the traps apply the slowdown egc. But that was too hard.
---
Am cri....
---
People suck man. It‚Äôs unfortunately that simple. I had a game last night where this Dwight was saving right in front of the killer, to the point where the person that was getting saved got killed because of it. Not right away but because of two stupid YOLO saves the Meg ended up getting tracked down for her 3rd and Final. So retroactively, my brother and I Yolo‚Äôd the Dwight until he died, Wraith ended up realising what we were doing and why so he farmed with us after the Dwight was gone. I ended up letting him kill me as a thank you. It is possible to play this game and not be toxic, some people just suck.
---
Please Entity, she just wants shoes.
---
The Oinkers can eat my hashbrowns.
---
Damn autocorrect
---
People in this thread and others swear he's a better Shape while ignoring that with EW3 Shape has an enhanced vault speed and a mile long lunge. He's tall but has a 8 meter TR with M&amp;A which is essentially no different than GF using his power on top of the fact that the synergy with IF makes his snowballing potential more lethal between the two.
---
But she's reckless enough to get herself killed so her sneak ain't at the peak
---
Petty insults and bullying aren‚Äôt going to distort the issue. 
---
First and foremost, if they actually are your friend and you‚Äôre just showing the ropes ‚Ä¶ well not ‚Äúfine‚Äù but I‚Äôll come back to ways they can deal with it. In any case, your friend should eventually catch up to you in rank and skill and make it a non-issue. The problem is that it *isn‚Äôt* just a handful of veterans with friends who are new to the game. On Xbox at least LFG and group finder exist and they make it very easy to form an organized group. That means it‚Äôs very easy for a high rank player (or several) to grab a low rank PUG to screw up the matchmaking.
---
From what I can tell, this happens in earnest *every single event.* Happened for the Lunar event; happened in the last Blood Hunt; only reason I don‚Äôt see it now is because rank reset happened right before the event started. Don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs just people and their friends. I know damn well it‚Äôs high ranks recruiting low ranks to get faster, easier matches. It‚Äôs a form of exploit, any way you cut it. Why even bother with matchmaking if SWF is exempt?
---
^^^^^^^^^
---
I‚Äôll have you know sir that she was only killed because she was blackmailed.
---
This could be the Legion rework.
---
Those people would be wrong
---
Thank you friend

---
Dismantly the hook in front skillet then tbag is rude
---
Which is what you‚Äôre gonna get when we throw you in the needle pit
---
it's useless I just get deleted, blocked, ignored, they leave my party right after I send one out, it's hard finding people to play with when they're being dickheads.
---
But, I mean, if she didnt have fatigue the way it is, she would be an utter monster
---
Hell Nah
---
Gotta catch up before the Season Series Finally
---

*Proceeds to get exposed effect*
---
Speak for yourself! I had a chep blue nail over Sunmer from one such pallet.
---
Or how about if for each person with a trap on the end game collapse slows down? As in 1x/2x/3x/4x understand what I mean?
---
Don't forget The Wraith watching them.
---
It‚Äôs gonna be syphilis with the way you‚Äôre talking

What she's wearing is sarashi (A¬†sarashi¬†is a long, thick cotton cloth that is tightly wrapped and worn under a¬†kimono¬†for the purpose of altering the figure of women to appear thinner.) Perhaps what happened during that day: Rin came home from her work (perhaps in her kimono? i doubt that though, maybe her causal clothes, since she did ride her bike? she might've took off her clothes while in the shed so she only wore sarashi? ) then slashy slashy happened, the slashes from the katana surely tore off some of her kimono/clothes, she tripped multiple times and fell through glass, so her appearence isn't weird at all.
---
I usually don't do it myself but this game is so toxic during bloodhunt that I don't care. After the 4th Billy in a row, if I see two people get downed at the same time and a gen hasn't been done, I'm not wasting my time on a doomed game. I am going to the next one in the hopes that the killer will leave his pink add-ons at home.
---
I think even rank one takes you back to rank 13
---
but even when the hag was done cleaning its claws, the person still healed. They meant to heal. Twas no accident
---
This is why I make a note of either running straight out the gate, or rushing straight back to save my friend from a hook.
---
I think enhances the part of our minds that thinks we are being sneaky is a good summary.
---
Tunneling is by far one of the dumbest complaints people have about this game. Typically it's just the killer going after the injured survivor as they should
---
The Killer will most likely get his bloodpoints anyway.
---
So take this as a lesson and take it to heart.
---
Give no quarter.
---
I got 3 party streamers while using Survivor pudding on the 2x bps weekend.  I'm rich
---
In before someone comments ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS BEXAUSSE U TBAG AND FLASHHLIGHT SPAM AND RUN META PERKS BABY SURVIVOR MAIN‚Äù
---
Well if I wasn‚Äôt sneaky then how come survivors don‚Äôt leave the gen until they hear the roar
---
I did it again next game and got a gg. So I guess they can have a heart.
---
I read this slightly slower because of the caps, fuck you
---
Not too sure how that relates to my post but ok üëç.
---
‚ÄòThe Collector‚Äô &amp; ‚ÄòThe Collection‚Äô
---
Haha, got em
---
Instakills still work, I think. Like, a certain deathline near the middle of the gate, if you cross it with a trap, you're dead.
---
Use spine chill. Find the Hatch. So far, the best thing I can say I do is go to a gate when endgame is triggered.
---
I'm a baby meg. When spine chill prompts I immediately sprint burst into a random direction. Walls happen
---
Because they're probably not looking at thier screens or looking around for that matter and sprint burst kinda defeats the roar
---
Biggest betrayal is if no survivor was in the locker. Biggest mid game
---
So unsatisfying that you‚Äôre wasting bloodpoints
---
You‚Äôre not wrong but you‚Äôre also a dick
---
I'd say it works in corn maps
---
I do it to let killers get the hit points
---
Bold of you to assume they have sprint burst. Geez the doctor is really deteriorating your brain
---
What made you think he was on the Survivor's side ? \^\^
---
AGAIN AHHH
---
Well us killers finally got our taunt, so we get to use it
---
So you would like it if I don‚Äôt use caps on the first letter if every word I use But I‚Äôm Not Gonna Stop No One Will Ever Stop Me
---
Thanks for explaining that. I gotta say, it does fit nicely with the image. Again, great art and thanks for explaining!
---
That's true sprint burst isnt used but still I mean pig isnt that hard to detect
---
You‚Äôll Never Escape Me Hahaahaha
---
This is why the Devs need to seriously rework Bloodpoint gains and just boost them a bit or rework how costly Bloodwebs are...a lot of,players LOVE these events (when ppl,arent douchebags) and then immediately dread the grind when it's "normal" and super grindy.  From this event alone I got 3 Killers up 40 levels/Bloodwebs and two Survivors up 30ish levels and already nearly at 900k BPs banked...and I've been loving it. 
---
 Minus the rank reset tryhards and trolls wanting to ruin/sweat the people attempting the event, it's been fairly fun, goofy and chill.  Even bad games where I'm salty or annoyed about my plays or a group getting me, I still leave the match happy with the Bloodpoints I earned...once this event ends...wont be the case at all
---

Few days ago you asked what the most annoying Doctor build to play against was. You know why and you're part of the reason the community is as it is.
---
And she gets a notification that a trap has been destroyed like a generator exploding
---
I usually dont see prestige piggy's since they realize how garbage she is
---
I think the Xbox community is a lot less rude to each other because I hear a lot about toxic people in this game but don‚Äôt see it in game so I think it‚Äôs just pc having the toxic problem and PlayStation but PlayStation in general is just a very toxic community probably because of the little kids on there but yea I‚Äôve literally said gg against everyone I go against they say gg nothing else expect for if we kept talking some times I give them tips if a low rank killer and they were having a hard time killing people and some times we just talked about the game
---
If it was up to Amanda she would be getting head pops left and right unfortunately certain things like to limit her which is unfortunate. But either way she gets the job done with the right tools.
---
To be honest I completely forgot about this post and I saw it like that a second time
---
I'd really love to see Jason come into dbd. He's pretty much the only licensed killer who didn't come to dbd yet. I don't know what his power would be though
---
Okay.
---
Didn't her father literally hack her to pieces so she's held together by cloth, duct tape and "Sarashi"
---
Likewise.
---
Do you think he's more of a banana smoothie or strawberry smoothie kinda person?
---
I think he'd be more of a banana person. Bananas are tall, just like him
---
I don‚Äôt know either but a camp crystal lake map would be sweet as hell (proved by his solo game which really got a bad rap, it was very comp like this one but it sure was less toxic)
---
They‚Äôre all running NOED, too.

---
I heard it‚Äôs getting a buff? What‚Äôs the nerf?
---
Well those killers for the most part have super abilities which Amanda doesn‚Äôt need because she doesn‚Äôt have to rely on something like that.
---
Even regular killers it‚Äôs nice to know when they are deciding to come to your gen next. I‚Äôm just very bad at choosing the wrong direction and sneaking right to them!
---
They are making it so that you get stacks from protection hits. They also tested it with unhooks but hopefully in the live servers they make it so that you only get stacks from protection hits. MoM can die and never come back

Let‚Äôs hope

Yep.. Thats what basement's hag is.. As a hag main i can assure its a GG when someone is in the basement.. Too much pressure!

Oh fuck off, I have autism spectrum disorder and this shit doesn‚Äôt bother me. Rather than people getting butthurt about shit they read online they could just toughen up and move on with their lives.
---
You could consider running TOTH in a hex heavy build, it's significantly better than a perk that does literally nothing lmao.
---
Na, you‚Äôre just salty. I‚Äôve opened the gate plenty of times after the hatch got opened and walked out.
---
the killer might get pissed about it but who cares isn't rude or bad manners anyway.
---
The end game collapse isn‚Äôt made for survivors to escape it‚Äôs in the game so if there are 5 gens left the survivor can‚Äôt just sneak around the map for 10 minutes.
---
If there are 4-5 gens left and the killer finds the hatch first he deserves to win.
---
Pretty easy to counter. Other survivors should be able to knock out 3 gens while one person is hooked.
---
You just proved why she's incompetent to other killers and trapper? Leatherface? I'd say leather face is bad but trapper is better than amanda since at least the trap stays and doesn't rely on you to knock them down and hoping the survivor is as incompetent as Amanda and does nothing bout it
---
I swear to god this area is bugged the slug house. you legit have a chance to clip in the wall so the killer sees you afking there.
---
What do the Jigsaw Boxes do? I haven‚Äôt considered interacting with them

K
---
You search them, hoping you find a key in one of them to release the Reverse Bear Trap on your head. They didn‚Äôt make Hex: Huntress Lullaby affect the skill check ‚Äúbing‚Äù noise probably because it seems you get more than usual skill checks while searching a Jigsaw Box.

What does it mean?
---
So that means i would have had:  
---
Ap Wraith  
---
Ap Hillbilly  
---
Ap Trapper  
---
Ap Doctor  
---
Ap Nurse  
---
and  
---
Ap Hag  
---
(for some reason my best luck is first time playing a killer.)
---
Claudette + Toolbox feels super powerful, is there any character more practical for support play than her?
---
Survivors can get out of the trappers traps and they can be disarmed. How does not relying on super natural abilities make Amanda incompetent if anything I would think it makes her more competent because she has the skills to down survivors without those abilities.
---
Just had a match against the plague. Also happened to be my first match against her. 2 of our poeple insta-dc'd, and it was me and my sfw. I had no idea how to go against her. We were on the map with the boat. We got 3 genes done, and she kept bouncing between the 2 near the pier, and the 1 on the boat. It was intense because she essentially held the game hostage, but was pretty terrible at chasing. Got to the point where me and my friend both had no more hooks left. We managed to open the door, and find the hatch just in case. He was about to go down, so i ran in to body block her (she had been chasing me for over 15 minutes total all game), and i lagged and went down. He somehow managed to body block her long enough for me to wiggle out, and we both ran into the door.   
---
Even though we had 2 dc it was super fun, i found i hate playing against the plague, but at the same time I love it.
---
Is it just me or are Legion and Myers the scariest killers?
---
2000 perks give 150,000, 2700 give 250,000.
---
I'm not saying she herself is incompetent but compared to you know Good killers she's out of the picture. The trappers traps can be taken out of so can jigsaw traps and she only starts out with 4(without addons) and trapper has much more than that
---
There‚Äôs a system called the ‚Äúemblem system‚Äù and basically it awards you 4 emblems based on your performance in a match, each of these emblems have 5 rankings, either no emblem, bronze, silver, gold and iridescent/red. The more emblems you earn and the higher their ranking the more points you get, once you get a certain amount of points you‚Äôll safety pip, meaning you don‚Äôt lose or gain anything, if you get a god amount of points you‚Äôll single pip, (pips are progress to the next rank) and if you get a great amount of points you‚Äôll double pip, if you perform poorly (or too well cuz the emblem system is a little shit sometimes) you‚Äôll depip, losing progress to the next rank. 
---
There‚Äôs a full break down of emblems here, it‚Äôll give you what the emblems are for, how many points towards an emblem actions give you, and how many points you need to get each rank of each emblem: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems
---
I mean yeah you can but doesn't mean you should. This just continues the trend of toxicity and makes the survivor that got played to do something equally bitchy to another person who may not have even deserved it.
---
When you die in that type of way and become so intensely evil and mean that you can systematically come back and physically hurt people you have done enough that you likely lost all reason so at a certain point you go from killing the killer in revenge to killing the boss for causing it to soon assuming everyone is at fault in some form.
---
I play mostly against hag, wraith, and billy on Xbox rank 20-18 the last two days
---
yes! i‚Äôm still actively working on a alternate pack for those who aren‚Äôt a fan of the gradients but all updates can be found here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1757661195

Camping = ez bp
---
Oof someone‚Äôs grouchy
---
But he wastes more time setting traps and by then a gen or two could already be done. But with Amanda she keeps them on her and her traps deter survivors from doing gens which gives her more time.
---
I get when nobody brings offerings during the event, then people get sweaty to try and get the most BPs out of their game, but you see all these BP offerings, which obviously means everyone just wants to have lots of BPs, why the need to be so sweaty?
---
You'll find it's all Leatherfaces as well. Enjoy!
---
From my pretty limited experience it's the worst time to play the game in general honestly. No more fun permitted, only farming.
---
I understand but then you don't get to play a real match anyways because the other 2/3 people are farming while you are trying to have a 'serious game'. Most people have been pretty good about it and I've gotten many thank you messages from people getting 80k bloodpoints. I'm not sure why you wouldn't go along with it under these circumstances on 2x weekends anyways. I understand on your everyday game it would be awful
---
There's a bit of it on the forums, but yeah it's outweighed by the people begging bhvr not to nerf him, quite interesting.
---
It‚Äôs what the tallfags deserve.
---
Honestly, my best suggestion is that you should watch Twitch streamers or YouTube videos and figure out whatever play style seems like your type. Otherwise, everyone will tell you to go for the top tier killers whether or not those appeal to you.
---
Gone. Reduced to atoms
---
The Archive Mode was mentionend in the anniversary stream. It is supposed to tell the story of the whole dbd world.
---
Yes. This is good.
---
It‚Äôs just when you use numbers to write
---
Ohh, I think I'm missing something. I just started playing again with the x2, its been about a year since I've actively played. I need to read up on the anniversary stream or watch the VOD. Now you got me excited!

I read you can gen rush, and then escape and depip, is that true?
---
Isn't Rin like 19?
---
I mean most trappers dont go around setting all traps immediately and with her its luck but most survivors loop her till the other one gets it off or 1 to 2 gens are done after the chase and the trapper can make looping harder granted wastes some time setting the trap during the chase but still he doesn't need to knock them down to set his trap
---
Why is it silly? Given how much more BP you get with killer (and how easy BBQ stacks are to get) why would you not play killer? Regardless of wait time!
---
This was a fun convo but it's getting late so let's just say you won
---
Thats worst, especially when you are already used to hearing for any breathing (eg myers or pig) but you main ash so his breathing is so loud you get scared by yourself
---
Write what?
---
Yeah people can be just toxic. during double bloodpoint events i always play my wraith build. built for blood points. I generally get 150k per match. I generally never get any kills, but its fine with me with the amount of points i get. I had one match where the guys spent like 5 minutes trying to convince me that i was trash because i didn't kill anyone. I laughed in his face, wished him gg, and left lol.
---
What the Hell are you doing here in that case!? Go watch Alien. GO. NOW! There's very little more important than this, job? No, relationship? No. Dead by Daylight? ...Well yes, but actually no. Alien!
---
Not sure why the other replies seem to not even be related to the post at all.
---
Anyway, I play Wraith but I'm only average at best, but clappers and soot are good for beginner ranks. Clapper makes it such that they can't tell where you're ringing your bell, they only know that you're hitting it, and the soot that suppresses terror radius and red stain after uncloaking is pretty useful so survivors can't tell where you're coming from. Later on you can get the coxcombed clapper which makes your bell silent which is even better. Other than that, I usually invest in addons for reappearance time rather than disappearance because I always try to get survivors before they manage to reach a pallet or window.
---
It's because they literally always do a bloodpoint weekend right after rank reset.
---
Yep, I‚Äôve also gotten 4 kills as a killer and depipped before. The games emblem system works so that you are only given points for certain actions, most of which involve extended interaction with the other team, and the shorter the game, the less time you have to get those points. Hence why I said you can actually get depipped by performing too well

Or do like 10 and then hook someone after closing hatch so EGC begins, good tip if you want to max every category

Also use legion, best farmer ever

Repost? IDK saw one about a meat hook
---
With the added benefit of deranking which means they'll get easier survivors next round.... smh
---
I guess you're just an alone wolf.
---
But blood points
---
\+1 for wholesomeness
---
Aw shit man, thanks for the red underline. I almost missed it.
---
Do people really have that much of a problem with MoM?
---
HAHA! We got another one, boys!
---
I get the feeling that I‚Äôm gonna get worse connection as survivor and as killer now
---
I agree that the backstories of the original killers are perfect for Netflix but disagree that the game doesn‚Äôt do these killers justice.
---
You can still get blood points just leave 1 alive
---
Thank you
---
But those sacrifice blood points
---
It's SUPER situational tho. Half the time you get hooked before you can do an unhook and it's a dead perk lol. It's only really good at the end of the game if you get your first hook and your teammates abandon you.
---
At the highest level it destroys killer momentum and pretty much all around punishes killers for hitting survivors
---
 https://imgur.com/8YppJag
---
I've seen more killers DC this event than survivors. And even then the survivors that quit were ones that were camped/tunneled with BBQ after bringing BPS (not that I agree but I can understand). I got flamed for being "too sneaky" because the killer kept losing me in a chase and flamed me that he didnt get his 4th stack (he wasnt farming or anything - just playing somewhat normally)
---
You can use Balanced Landing in the middle one.
---
Captain?
---
Best crawl to it either way. When I give hatches, I bring them over it, then put them about a ten second's crawl away.
---
*3 survivors proceed to get downed shortly afterwards*
---
The opposite of "Just Leave".
---
3 sacrificed is enough ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I really wish they'd create a movie for all the original killers, especially the legion and huntress. I feel like their movies would be amazing
---
The cycle continues.
---
I think its more that a lot of idiots play this game...   
---
Most of them dont even know they're idiots...
---
What?
---
Wonder if I'll ever see an event where people don't turn into entitled little brats.
---
The bloodpoints for escaping (especially through the hatch) are far more beneficial for the survivor than the killer...
---
I've noticed that too! It's sad because usually the surviviors are the "bad" guys for DC'ing which some of them do have no reason but I think being camped is a good reason too. Sorry not sorry. Who wants to hangout on a hook, while a killer looks at you and get no points.
---
I like Bond.  Not for knowing where my teammates are in general play.  But specifically for knowing when someone is bee-lining my way in such a way as to obviously be leading the killer towards me, even if unintentionally.  It can give you just that bit of time to adjust your position to not get spotted, or to be in position to block the killer for them to get them that extra little bit of time to make it to another loop or such.  Or to even just lay a different trail of scratch marks as to confuse the killer about where they went, giving them a better chance.   Scratch marks from the same side of the window after they do a slow vault can get them to safety and the killer onto you.  Letting your teammate heal and recover their exhaustion perk CD, and hopefully continue to work on the gen you just jumped off of.
---
Had a Claud do this to me. When I found her I pretended I haven‚Äôt, stated to chainsaw away but turned around lest second and got the fucking Claud
---
Just so you know: we have LFG posts on the other side of the console slums.
---
That and/or Colourphobia + a game map piece. Makes the healing slower by 50% so you can hit and leave and essentially just make life hell with all the skill checks from snapping out of it/healing for forever with insanity
---
Dwight because I identify with his socially awkward nerd-iness. Hag because I love map control and variability in strength (decent base add ons, fun body block add on, OP insta teleport add ons etc.) (Spirit for tryharding). 
---
Favorite to go against is Micheal. Scratched Mirror is scary, tombstone is scary, but at the end of the day there is a degree of counter-play so it‚Äôs rewarding when you make the right call and get rewarded. I love that jumping into a locker is the right call to avoid an insta mori
---
*rawr*
---
And if 4-5 gens are done and the killer finds the hatch first you deserve to lose?
---
Yeah
---
My head-canon is that the entity veils her vision with illusions of her father. She seems to be blind due to her lack of pupils or irises and this may have been done to further the entity‚Äôs goal in manipulating her to do its bidding. Idk just a thought.
---
Me too! Lmfao I know Premonition let's you know a general direction that cooldown punishes me hard. So I just usually end up taking a bad guess or hide and hope
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse, Thanataphobia, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, &amp; Sloppy Butcher. 
---
I recently used the Bloodhunt to unlock and grind out Thanataphobia and unlock it on Legion. I was previously running BBQ in its place. This build requires a pretty aggressive play style but it can be incredibly oppressive if you keep damage on. 4 stack of Thanataphobia combined with Sloppy makes for insanely long heal times for survivors.
---
I say we both won this was an interesting debate and I had fun.
---
But not for my double pip
---
Noice, well good night
---
Good night
---
also not that great if you get farmed off hook right in front of killer
---
"Dead Brother" (Dead Hard)
---
Not at red ranks
---
A mini series that take 1-2 episodes on each killers backstory would be amazing
---
Or "you killed me first from a 3rd hook because I kept running around you"
---
I swear survivors just want killers to only hook them once per game then go off and have a nap.
---
Fuck this was me ALL night tonight
---
I fucking hate when people do this shit
---
Ok I‚Äôm here for my blood points not the survivors

It just depends on if you know they will be able to finish.  Solo gen progress is (relatively) faster than group gen progress assuming everyone is working on a gen, so if you don't need to crank out that specific gen RIGHT NOW splitting up is good.
---
For a killer, hearing the gens pop 1 at a time gives me time to adjust my gameplan and such.  Maybe I am overcommitting to this chase, and should just let them go and go protect those gens.  3 gens popping at the exact same second though?  Oh boy do I feel fucked.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the only time I think it‚Äôs acceptable to do this shit, otherwise stop being a bitch (not you specifically lol)
---
Micheal is a solid killer to start with and learn how to play killer. Plus he has the John Carpenter soundtrack when in chase which is nice.
---
Spirit is one of the best killers (and very fun to play as) but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to someone starting out. Definitely my choice for 2nd Best DLC. 
---
I personally play Wraith at low ranks because he‚Äôs fun, Hag in upper Mid ranks because she is very decent and fun. And Spirit in high ranks because she is pretty strong and has some busted add ons (left Micheal behind after figuring out what I enjoy most to play as)
---
Yo.. that would be pretty messed up if the Entity actually did that.
---
All of us except the killer were grouped up playing with each other, so we all knew he was in the closet.
---
Farm not harm
---
If only killers in my matches were fair like this :‚Äô(
---
What buff? Was it announced anywhere?
---
My Myers is still underleveled, thank god there is Piggy. Yeah for some reason there is more chances of me letting a survivor go when I play her. Is it the stun noise?
---
Well then that would mean, that all killers lived in the same time line. There would be Freddy and Michael Myers in the same universe.
---
Ah I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Dang you're nice than I am
---
Given the alternative, having an absolute maximum of 4 minutes to close out a game isn't so bad. And that's only if you start the timer downed. 
---
In most realistic scenarios, it'll probably just be ~1 minute of being slugged. In those cases I usually get up, grab some water or go to the bathroom, and by the time I get up the EGC has finished.
---
Valar morghulis
---
kill it.
---
I did that once and took them to the gate and let them go
---
Eww and the post
---
The thing is, if we could see what offering the others would use BEFORE the match starts, just during this event, we should be good. Because every now and then I'm like, been a while, I feel like mori'ing someone, so I just do it
---
Myers: *heavy breathing intensifies*
---
But I am friendlier when I play her
---
I‚Äôm sorry that you believe that what I said means I‚Äôm a campy and tunnel killer but that is the aim of the game to get as many points as you can and that is 100% percent possible to do so without giving the hatch and both sides enjoy themselves
---
Yep, skipping two whole hook events per survivor is just brutal on the survivor's power budget.   They lose one whole extra try after getting hooked, and the others lose any chance of trying to save them from death after the first hook has occurred.
---
I do think Ebony Mories need another balance pass as a result.  Tying it to total number of hooks(Or better yet, unhooks) that have occured (Every 2 hooks/unhooks earns one mori, still must have hooked at least once) gives SOME relief to tunneled survivors in this situation (You can't at least be instantly mori'd after the first time you were unhooked unless he also hooked someone else/someone else also has been unhooked).  A bit of breathing room, and survivors can count unhooks to know if a down is a risk of a mori or not.
---
Green can keep the current "Just must have hooked once" stipulation because it's one time use status.
---
Been farm city on the PS4 8-12 range for the last couple days (in me experience anyway.) Got 5 new sharable perks and saved 700k for ghosty boy.
---
Sorry your experience has been so much worse.
---
When teammate comes to generator you've been working on for whole minute, immediately fucks up skills check, moments later killer comes and starts chasing YOU.
---
I got a insidious Bubba yesterday, right at the end of the game, so I killed myself on the hook to save the others. Felt satisfying. But then I spectated and a Nea got chainsawed cause she was toying around...sigh. lol I tried, she awaits the same fate
---
Grim Reaper maybe?
---
I would love if Jason was in DBD, I hope they can somehow make it happen
---
he has much smaller knives ;;
---
who cares if that how he wants to play the game then i dont see the problem
---
His steam profile comments reassured me that indeed it wasnt a joke.
---
If you actively stay nearby that hooked survivor, to make sure he dies, it's camping. That's about it
---
i wish survivors wouldn't chainblind, bm and genrush a ruinless killer with obvious no intention to kill who sluged a recently hooked person because their teammate farmed them when there's no obsession in game on a fukin huge ass Coldwind map(i played Spirit and specifically used bps and farming build - BBQ, Distressing, Thrill and slapped on Infections Fright just for fun alongside with brown add-ons that i have over 200) and then call you a baby killer cause you specifically crippled yourself by forgiving their mistakes to not kill them and only hook twice(which you did). they didn't even get the hint when i completely ignored people who have been hooked twice. they thought i'm just bad =\ on rank 8 few days after reset, sure. i tried to be wholesome. but all i'd get was 3-4 MoMs per game, instaheals, good toolboxes and fast medkits. i used bps, they used cakes. i'm so disappointed in this community every single event. 
---
so i played Insidious Hag after all this bullshit. and i will camp and tunnel just to ruin other people's fun. that's what happens when you get 4 games in a row with over 2 MoMs per match and at least one instaheal every game.
---
At least some perk where if the killer is within 2 - 5 meters, you get bonus bloodpoints when you struggle
---
Candyman from Candyman
---
Norman Bates from Psycho
---
Jack Torrance from The Shining
---
Imagining a Bates Motel and Overlook Hotel map would be pretty awesome.
---
But of course! Make sure to get bonus bloodpoint perks to help you out :)
---
Wat
---
That I have done :)
---
I slugged them all and made them race against eachother, slug race to the exit gate. They all waited next to eachother for me to give the start sign too
---
Scariest shit in the game is definitely silent spirit. Only way to counter is spine chill but, you never know when you're going against them.
---
Yeah this event is perfect to pick up a DLC and level that character up. On the other hand, you can just lvl up your fav character, get all the perks, so you don't have to struggle anymore to get any new perks you desire.

\[F\*\*KING IRRELEVANT\]([https://youtu.be/33yMj\_yLN00?t=11](https://youtu.be/33yMj_yLN00?t=11)) The Entity NEEDS this!
---
Oh, I'm sorry, would the shirtless version have been better?
---
Not even sure why you're defending such a common occourance. If 5-6 comments state that he has a terrible connection, why would it be so hard to believe?
---
They know, if they are on the hook they are watching your aura, and if they see you spinning around, they know.
---
I shocked him before I realized the countdown was so far, and that last scream really did screw him.....
---
When I play Bubba, I facecamp to keep the stereotype alive. I'm toxic, I know.
---
Anyway, I sit in that corner at the basement, and two survivors come in to the rescue - Woosh Woosh they're down, and all dead. I want to keep other randoms from dying just like I did to keep them from making the same mistake, cause it was a basement Bubba, by killing myself rather then struggling, tempting my team to check out the basement where Bubba's waiting. And the exit gates were about to pop too when I struggled. I let go as soon as they got opened
---
Bhvr is making the mobile game for stranger things nothing to do with dbd
---
[F\*\*KING IRRELEVANT](https://youtu.be/33yMj_yLN00?t=11) The Entity NEEDS this!
---
Yeah, I agree. And yeah, usually chainsaw is easy to sidestep, but in high ranks you go up against some real sweaty billies who will just follow you and start the chainsaw when they're right behind you. It's harder to 360 that when they're like an inch away from you.
---
I don't see why the devs have a kneejerk reaction to nerf every new perk when people whine about it. MoM is not bad unless all four survivors use it.
---
Does that mean we‚Äôre playing as the entity controlling her rather than the actual killer? That would also explain the clunkiness in playing killer, in general.
---
And dont forget how evil incarnate can be ruined by a survivor who disconnects.
---
Dumb design.
---
Arrite, fair. And yeah, I never understand why Bubba camping works every time. Survivors will run into the basement like lemmings no matter what.
---
They just delete the negative comments and leave the positive ones up.
---
I have open comments and leave them all up except for the really hateful ones that use slurs. Its about 90% salt 10% nice
---
Wtf since when do you play multiplayer games to help out the other team? The goal is to win. Escape with as many survivors possible or kill as many as possible. That simple. Not talking about camping or tunneling but im certainly not just going to give the hatch instead of killing the person. Nor would I let the killer hook me instead of escaping. There's winners and losers to games
---
Baby meg with Alex toolbox asking what the map addon is!! This is so cute 
---
Map addon - marks a location on the map, all survivors can ser
---
Pips tho, specially with rank reset
---
Can we have a Myer's version of this?
---
How did they not play fair?
---
Why the hell would your teammate not open the damn door? He almost lost it for you because you had to go for the L wall
---
It's almost a guaranteed hook when you don't know as well
---
Lery's is where I got my first 100k game with the Doctor. I love that map!
---
Doctor with Distressing, Unnerving, BBQ, and Ruin is a nice setup. Really maxes BPs and is fun, even when you don't kill everyone.
---
You say dont tunnel off hook but why should i go for the guy who isn't injured and is already crouching behind covor when you are running in a straight line to a no pallet zone. I mean its called an unsafe hook rescue for a reason. Just get over being farmed by your teammate and blaming the killer. If you do get away and i find you again dont get mad at me for killing you cuz you were just caught.
---
On the other hand, I used BPS on my killer and then gen rushed 3 games in a row. After that I started bringing Mori. I slug, I kill, I tunnel. I don't care if you aren't having fun, me neither.
---
&gt;Yesterday had a rank 15 game on Xbox where the killer ran an Ebony Mori (along with Hex:Ruin) as Hillybilly (best console killer) proceeds to Mori everyone despite all of us running blood point add-ons (but no Bloody Party Streamers).
---
So, he played the game? In a multi-BPS game, I can see deliberately easing off so people can get insane BP, but your Escape Cake is not a defense against Moris, dude.
---
Oh yeah....that felt GOOOOOOOOD.
---
Yikes.
---
So, is it your contention then, that the only time tunneling complaints are legitimate is when it was sub-optimal play? If someone triple hooks a survivor in a way that sets them up for an eventual merciless, that's fine?
---
I'm sorry but with the same logic freddy gets an easy first hit because he is invisible. Easy first hit means there is little the survivor can do to avoid getting hit the first time, like the Legion's FF or the Plague's vomit, but can not ensure a down using said ability. The Wraith and the Pig are really easy to avoid since they don't have total stealth.
---
Unfortunately my goal is to be a marksman for one of her achievements
---
Yeah but Thana only adds 12-16 seconds with all survivors being injured. I'll take that over her having a super long range hit box.
---
Am I really alone in thinking the new DS is the literal worst survivor perk in the game?
---
Orange shirts are a rare breed
---
I'm obviously in favor of having an enjoyable game AND getting bloodpoints but I dont believe in putting bloodpoints above enjoyment for all.
---
So what genius at BHVR decided to put both self heal and pallet throwing on the same button?
---
At least he has an ultra rare, sincerely, a Billy main.
---
I drop them near the hatch.....then mori them.
---
The dream world is infinitely less impactful.
---
I always have my phone brightness turned down üòÇ
---
Sometime between 12-2pm EST
---
Was it in the same match? If it‚Äôs not in the same match, then guess what. Pallets font stay broken forever and just because you broke them in one game dosent mean they‚Äôll be broken the next
---
Okay you might be right they have a little counterplay but I still think that 90% of the time it's unreasonable to expect survivors to be able to do it, especially considering how easy her power is to use.
---
Play a killer with BBQ and dont be a camping dick
---
Yep. As I said they are quite powerful especially for purple addon.
---
Why people hate Hag? &gt;.&lt; She's the most jumpscary killer in the game and her tactical gameplay is really enjoyable. I guess ppl just don't want to do something harder than just following survivors... And survivors don't like loosing ;)
---
He isn't available on the console versions, if you play PS4 or Xbox.
---
If I have the last person on the ropes and I down them I like to let them go.
---
Every artist I know would agree with your statement. 
---
However, you cannot run from your destiny.
---
As a Huntress you need to ue hatchets to your advantage Kappa
---
Cartoon shmuck*
---
Thanks
---
Makes me wanna tear my fucking eyeballs out dude
---
Ever heard of the add-on VHS [REDACTED]
---
Same. I like knowing if someone is suspiciously running to me or if they're in a chase, etc.
---
DONT CAMP. DONT TUNNEL. DONT SANDBAG. DONT SELL OUT TEAMMATES. DONT T-BAG. Everything else is fair game, but pussy killers always complain about SWF and DS or MoM, and pussy survivors complain about NoED and Ruin
---
Meg needs to stop trying to touch her forehead with her upper lip though, and Claudette could afford to shut her mouth occasionally. She permanently has that horrendous vacant stare with her mouth hanging open and her weird little T-Rex arms.
---
Like buffing Nurse
---
No, it's a survivor perk that helps. If you want to bitch about survivors having one powerful perk, complain about NoED too.
---
This. At the moment, I would be happy as long as he is on similar level as Shape.
---
Seriously tho I think the bandages are her underwear
---
The girl from the ring maybe? Not sure how it'd work in gameplay
---
And good killers shouldnt have a problem landing one more hit. Cherrypicker
---
The traps are meant to stall for time, not to be a death sentence
---
Probably ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
From his profile, I‚Äôm gonna say he just started playing when the game was put on the Xbox game pass
---
yea
---
I personally run balanced lending or dead hard, in combination with adrenaline, self care, and urban evasion.
---
MoM, Dead Hard, DS, And Adrenaline. How many F‚Äôing times should we have to hit you?
---
R/CursedComments ?
---
I am sorry, but I represent the Oinkers\_ I cannnot agree.
---
HE NEEDS A NERF. a very slight one. Just make it possible to break him out. My only problem is that he is as powerful as the nurse, and requires no skill to play. So people at low ranks will essentially be playing a rank one nurse.
---
Honestly, I hate it when people who are new **(not all)** to something think that they know what is best for the game and that they have ideas on how a game can be ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù when they legit just started playing
---
I hate to be that guy but I really liked the overall design of the MTV scream outfit, it was the first time someone tried to make ghostface a stand out character on its own not a halloween costume that was little more than a scary disguise. 
---
It had a reasonable explanation for all the parts that went into it and was a practical outfit that a serial murderer might wear. If we break it down the mask was the motive in that Brandon James was the catalyst for everything in the series and his own legacy of murder is what made the mask scary to begin with.
---
The raincoat not only is waterproof and easily cleanable it can be very quickly be changed into and out of. It obscures the shape of your body so escaped victims cannot tell if you are male or female or how heavy/slight you are, it is also very loose around the arms and legs allowing for full sprints and full usage of your arms while not compromising the disguise. 
---
Overall I rate the costumes like this
---
Brandon James outfit
---
DBD rendition and cosmetics 
---
Scary movie mask and double over cloak
---
Scre4m outfit
---
Most other outfits
---
Peanut eyed ghost mask used in the opening of scream one (seriously go back and watch that scene the mask is awful)
---
You forgot pallet tbagging. *Then the silly fucks forgot that was the 5th pallet and get fucked by spirit fury*
---
This is the opposite of people who don't ever cleanse a totem and complain about it: you overplayed the perk. 5 minutes (or half that, if you are misremembering) is too long to spend looking for a totem. Coordinate a finish and go.
---
Play a different killer.
---
To me it seems like he barely knows how to play, and wants to make the game more beginner killer friendly, ergo the pallets and flashlights ‚Äúchanges‚Äù
---
As long as they know you COULD have killed them then they know you won the game and they lost, like downing them inside an exit gate, picking them up and dropping them. Giving the hatch gives them 8000 but killing them only gives you 1000-2000, but it‚Äôs up to the killer since he earned those points
---
He's playing deads sloppy and mori. I somehow missed the "good" part ü§î
---
And now you fucked up.
---
No, it's a killer perk that helps. If you want to bitch about killers having one powerful perk, complain about MoM too.
---
OHHHH I DID.
---
I'd love to give you a RBT.
---
Connotations of tremendous usually refer more to large rather than 'extremely good', sorry for misunderstanding. I was going more off the Amanda's Letter style of red item when considering something that's a 'Tremendous Change'.
---
Fair enough
---
Yep, but don‚Äôt follow in trashes footsteps
---
I am here brother, I will join the fight!
---
Yeah hearing as killer is very important. That one sound of grass moving where you passed by, and you're like "What was that?!" and you can't find anyone but you're like "I could have sworn I heard something" and a moment later you find that guy. Satisfying.
---
Wasn't just referring to op
---
Oh yeah okay I see what you mean now. Yeah I tried to use the terms usually in game for it to make a little more sense.
---
I swear to god that bacon is gonna eat you.
---
Best video today
---
I always dc in the loading screen if I see Haddonfield offering :) Not fun knowing it's imposible to win. Unless you're Nurse or Hag, maybe Spirit.
---
No
---
I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't want the stranger things monster in the game.
---
I get what you mean, but even in-game I think tremendous is used to mean large rather than especially good. Ie overcharge gives survivors a "Tremendously difficult" skill check.
---
I always love the idea of stalk type of killer. I didn‚Äôt feel that much with Amanda or even with Shape. 
---
I‚Äôm currently really liking the state of Ghostface and I would be so sad IF he gets a nerf. We all know that we are actually lacking some stronger Killers as it‚Äôs usually just Floating Lady it Fast Boi in higher tiers.
---
Object of Obsession is. So OP is saying that if you don't want to buy the Halloween Chapter, Spine Chill is a free alternative perk.
---
I think the post was trying to say that spine chill is a good alternative to Obj of Obsession for those who don‚Äôt want to spend dosh.
---
It‚Äôs really obvious, he thinks pallets just magically reappear after being destroyed üòÇ
---
Only cleanse after others cleanse first. Got it

---
Btw. love your icons for perks/ability, care to share?
---
Bruh, they're Ultra Rare.
---
Calm.
---
We have to wait until he goes live but right now around mid-tier imo. His perks are garbage tier, another 3 unusable perks almosy as good as Monstrous Shrine.
---
bruh i just use it with ruin for no gens on piggy
---
STOP REMINDING US OF THE DAY SHE ALMOST DIED!!!
---
Just because you have something doesn't mean you get to speak for every disabled person though so how about you take your own advice and fuck off and stop getting buythirt over people trying to defend the disabled and make the internet more wholesome.
---
Aw she's cute as hecc
---
I know I just meant teabagging or toxic ones lol this Claudette in the video was just seeing if she could help teamate out
---
Duh. I miss read it thanks
---
Legion should have been a disguise killer, like if he/she downs someone while they are in the ground you could change to look like them, when I think ‚Äúthe darkness within‚Äù I think ‚Äúthe enemy within‚Äù basically a plain cloths killer that could be any one of us.
---
It does.  
---
Source: I use it on pig for a very good fuck gens build.
---
When gates spawn together, you are SoL.
---
Just like a killer when Ruin spawns on a gen.
---
Or when a pallet into jungle gym into pallet combo spawns.
---
You got bad RNG and the Power role beat you to the hatch. Its not meant to be easy for solo survivors to win in any situation.
---
*its why you outnumber the killer*
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Okay but seriously, Pig is known to be one of the killers that always thinks 2 steps ahead. When I bought Pig I did 30minutes of research on her before I played. why do people think it works? I think not a single fuck your skillchecks build works. sad oink :(
---
Overcharge gives a small skillcheck tho lol. But I was thinking more about how they use "slightly moderately considerably tremendously" as a scale of effect.
---
I think I've seen some art of this...
---
It's still completely pointless. The only killer it may be useful on is Nurse and there are still better perks.
---
I invite you 2 play against the Oinkers\_ you unworthy survivor.

Yeah I was thinking the same thing, the swing on the window wasent a terrible play but the one at the barrel was questionable. 
---
It was smart to not go for the person messing around on the harvester though, by no manner a bad player. Using Mori's doesn't mean your bad
---
its a spoiler for le scream movie
---
lets make them even more not the same then
---
Okay understandable. Ty. So what is the power button? People say use power button for night shroud or something, is that l2
---
Didn‚Äôt know gens took 20 minutes.

Heyyy Mettle acutually give killers 300  more

Bloodpoints

Yeah don't see many people disagreeing with it.

Get real, you don't actually care about either animal in the gif. You just want to flex.
---
Their opinion isn't controversial.
---
also swung multiple times with no hit even in reach. Still doesnt change that this lauries behaviour. Yet Pink Mori in dbl BP Event big ol yikes.
---
yeah lots of hosting companies do, and its not hard to get new ones setup... but we're still not officially on the list.
---
When was their a double BP
---
RIP OCE

Don't feel bad. Their stupid ass mistake

People bitching over a joke? Yeah, that's Reddit for you. If you can't handle ANY type of jokes that are EXPLICITLY jokes, then you need to get off the internet. I can joke about stupid shit like cheesy dad jokes to the horrible shit like holocaust, 9/11, disabled, race, etc.
---
Same here
---
Ay Six9ined I see him all the time up at red ranks not half bad at survi or too.
---
No the other one
---
What country are you from?
---
I really only play survivor but have been trying killer out lately. I'm not a very good killer but I'm trying to get better. In my match before this I had a bunch of survivors tea-bagging me so I brought a mori this time just in case.
---
Well that's just plain understandable :P
---
Oh no this is my goal and someone did it first 
---
I want to D I E
---
Thx
---
Well now, r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
A soul for a soul
---
I gotta try that some time! :P
---
When you run into 3 traps in a row and end up running into a wall. Thanks game.
---
No one left behind, no one is a wasted effort. As long as you get them to think or talk about it, that's as much as I can ask from anyone.
---
ruh roh raggy,, thrats brerry kinky
---
Most of the time the survivorsnjust correct you and let you know it was ez for THEM, and not you. Sometimes they have a sense of humor.
---
I love this
---
Have you really never heard of leetspeak?
---
M'Gnoggin. HOO!
---
Well I believe it's coded in game as "hit this skillcheck and it fills the wiggle bar" so maybe it does? It just depends I guess.

I thought it was more Velma.

There's a double bp event happening right now
---
What gets annoying is the shit talking that comes afterwards towards a killer, even if all four escape there's follow up messages on how "you suck". (even worse when it's SWF). Like congrats üëçüèªyou managed to gen rush and work as a team. I doubt survivors experience this type of constant hate from a killers perspective.
---
I was hoping you would comment ty &lt;3
---
Ruins the fun for both parties. 
---
No way a killer has fun starring at a dude hanging on a hook for a solid 4 minutes.
---
You'd be surprised at what people find fun and unfun honestly.

For instance, I have fun getting jigsaw'd

Feature. I think when Freddy came out it used to wake you up but was changed as part of a bone to throw with the Freddy Nerfs.

It'll wake you up in the rework though.

Oh yeah I know. I‚Äôm just as much a sucker for the character/costume as I am the series.
---
Have a good day
---
Not today.
---
Obviously not. It's a short clip though so can't really tell if the Nurse was camping, she seemed to be checking around to see if there was someone nearby and then left.
---
Ghostface comes out Tuesday btw.
---
Tbh at least there's a timer on the toxicity. Before EGC, survivors would literally stay in game for hours just for you to see them.
---
No but if the killer killed 3 people before the gates are even powered he deserves to get a big chance of winning
---
One I don't hardly ever see is the Man in the Mask from the Strangers movies. I think he could be pretty unique.
---
What do I keep doing wrong?
---
I mixed up everything today. I would have realised eventually that it‚Äôs the 17th today
---
The Man in The Mask from the Strangers. Shouldn't be too hard to get.
---
If it wouldn't take far too long, I'd say it was still worth grinding shards for the Shrine.
---
Simple, we boycott until they give us what we want.  
---
Game companies need to stop acting like we don't fucking exist, especially when we have such a large gaming community.
---
Well franks is just useless without being able to use frenzy when you want. He did make lots of people DC, etc. because the bleed-out tuner would never stop. This still makes it stop, but only reduces with feral frenzy hits, which requires 3 hits to down, more than any killer in the game (one to apply the deep wounds effect, 2 more to down if you have franks mix tape on. otherwise it will take 4 total hits without the mixtape) It seems reasonable to me?
---
This is literally the part where I'll come in and remind people that Spine Chill is a complete and total counter to Spirit. She becomes a complete joke of a killer with it on
---
It works so well because the light on the characters face in the picture is the flames from the lit totem.
---
P3 Claudette nods agreeingly.
---
Best map for Balanced Landing is the Game
---
Both adepts should be changed to a single pip. Make survivors have to do something, and reduce killers needing a perfect game.
---
Especially Plague, the survivors stay broken so you CANNOT get enough hits/chases to double pip unless you intentionally slug them so they can be healed up repeatedly. That and Corrupt Intervention actively makes mid-late game harder.
---
I'm going to Kermit suicide
---
Someone doesn't understand how this shit works
---
Abit toxic aint it? Its like a surv teabagging
---
He could. I personally find him enjoyable to play as/against, but he‚Äôs not as powerful and could use some buffs such as vault speed, cool down duration, and darkness during cool down though.
---
No, I knew, but it‚Äôs good for the sake of the post :)
---
Hmm. 2 kills is an even game. 3/4 kills is a win. 0/1 kill is a loss.
---
Thats how I look at it.
---
I often have this problem when I switch from a 115% Movespeed Killer like Legion to a 110% like Hag or Spirit that I misjudge my lunge and need a few swings to get accustomed. Also some Killers have different lunge reaches not depending on their movement speed. Nurse for example can reach really far without having to build up some momentum.
---
Muscle memory can be deceiving.
---
Well..........hope you enjoyed that.
---
For the killer to go after the full healed survivor. Don‚Äôt worry, if you tunnel once it‚Äôs fine, just try to go after the other survivors.
---
This is depressingly true.
---
I know how it works, I'm PS4 so I was mainly aiming at muting ps voice chat.
---
Obviously wouldn't work well on pc unless they muted hardware settings etc.
---
Oh well no need to kill the guy trying to at least suggest something.
---
Obviously not. How about this perk then:
---
Any players in SWF screen goes black for 20 seconds after a hook.
---
Enjoy giving out dat dere intel
---
yeah but if you have a trap on your head and then the last gen pops and a survivors instantly opens the gate you have no chance to survive
---
Also, delete yourself from existance please.
---
When you post something to the internet, there's no such thing as 'your thread'.

---
BHVR needs to hire you to balance their game.
---
You don't owe anybody a finished game.
---
Hag is currently my favorite killer to play. If you get your Hook game running Hag is one of the strongest killers. If you get you Basement game running the survivors need some serious tactics to get fully out of it. 
---
On the other Hand you often need a lot of time to get anything going and if they know how to loop a Hag you won't get anything. Early ruin finds are hags demise.
---
ALSO a simple flashlight counters most of her ability. If I see 1 Flashlight in the lobby I consider hard to play her. If I see 2 or more im just switching to another Killer or dodge the lobby.
---
You can‚Äôt take screenshots of your chats
---
I do not understand?You chased a survivors that was toxic and you downed him and then he dc'd.Nothing really special.Am I missing something?
---
only crows and footsteps give spirit away. Grass doesn't move actually.
---
Sans?
---
agreed , everyone was hyped for it but i wasn't a fan
---
I played a game where we all played very stealthy (weren't even a SWF, just all happened to) against a Huntress...because she is slow and has a directional lullaby so stealth is very strong against her. She dc'd and complained that we weren't playing properly...
---
It is.
---
Too bad most survivors overlook this.
---
Run TotH, prayer beads wig snatch!
---
But the timer of the reverse bear trap is shorter than the endgame timer. And if you get get slugged or hooked the endgame timer becomes even longer, so i don't see the problem with reverse bear traps here.
---
If anything opening the gates would get the pig to rush to the gates to chase survivors out, giving you time to hit the boxes.
---
yes!
---
I mean abuse as in the survivor had so much power over a hatch standoff. Killer could legit do nothing but wait or dc. In a sense it was semi hostage (although the killer didn't help)
---
I agree that hatch standoffs were two jackasses butting heads but when I see it it's because both sides feel like the other shouldn't win. When it happened I smacked and left cause I can finish 2 more games in the time it takes to end the standoff. Both were petty but it was still ass to deal with.
---
Also some people would just go around the map and never attempt the hatch and if you couldn't find them you were stuck in this game for as long as they wanted. Couldn't find a claudette on a map and the hatch didn't even spawn cause no gens. Took 10 minutes before she finally dcd. It was hell.

---
Run down the stairs *taps forehead*
---
which one are far worse?
---
Ik it's a 3 minute stand still waiting to play another but back when gates were open and they just waited at the gate it was hell. My technique was to sit in the basement and watch videos until they left. At that point the assholes can waste their own time.
---
I swear that looks like gumball
---
Yesterday a killer killed all my teammates and I was downed. He was looking at me at using his chainsaw and I was like if you want to kill me just kill me. For a moment he was gone somewhere else in map and I was looking for hatch while crawling(didn't get far, he came back). He grabbed me then dropped me then he will just look at me(did more than twice) while my health bar was depleting. At some point I was able to get free from him. While I was healing myself he found me again and put me in dying state. Within few second I was gonna die if he didn't grabbed. He grabbed me and dropped me to the hatch and I was like wtf was that. 3 killers who let me live yesterday while dropping me in exit gate or in hatch.
---
wtf
---
I camped 2 survivors for the sac daily

Survivors complain if the game takes too long or is too quick, you're either a baby killer or filthy tryhard, you're a camper but you have 5 pips D. Hope. They complain if you Mori, but complain if you don't Mori because they wanted to see the animation. I even had a survivor complain about having 'OP' brown add-ons
---
I'm that team mate who opens right away, I love the pressure lol
---
I always loved him, gameplay was simply nice and even though i wasnt 4K‚Äôing, i always felt good because i said ‚Äûhah, at least i have 30k+ points without bbq‚Äù
---
And no, i wasnt tunneling and using m2 like bitch, i actually played like he is played today
---
We don‚Äôt have a bird yet and the concept is pretty cool
---
Call me stupid but I really wish this game would chill on the cycle cause everyone bullies everyone and its such a toxic community with bits of light in some places. It's super beginner unfriendly and as my favorite game I want to see it take off even more than it has.
---
I like giving hatch and usually if I'm guaranteed a 4k, I'll find the hatch and give it to them so hopefully they can spread the gesture.
---
Salty much?

Hex: Devour Toxic.
---
I give credit where it is due:)
---
As someone who has been playing a lot of killer recently   People trying to 360 me is the joke.   Do people not realise that it‚Äôs better to have sensitivity at 100%, then you can just spin with them.  You get a hit in 100% of the time.  And I only camp those tea bagging toxic twats.

Which is what sucks about BHVR not having a BHVR or DBD account system.  I can‚Äôt be bothered to re do literally every survivor.  And re buy literally every survivor.  
---
And killer.
---
Did you reply to the wrong person or something? My message you replied to has nothing to do with that topic.
---
I once got a 3 day suspension from Sony for sending a message to a face camper who constantly hit me on the hook during the Hallowed Blight event... all I said was ‚Äúno need to be a dick for no reason‚Äù and I got suspended for it.
---
For me it's just been the liong waiting times for killer, the rest is cool
---
Obviously he doesn't want them to do their only objective so fast that the match ends so quickly. Wtf is so hard to understand about that?
---
Recently I was playing Hag and got Ace in a basement. Hag's basement usually = GG, but anyway, I trapped the Groaning Storehouse(basement was below) and left. Meg ran into the Storehouse and activated my trap so I teleported. She tried to loop me in the storehouse, I hit her, she left so I trapped it again. The she ran again to one of my trap trying to destroy it, so I reset it. She started running over and over again to the same trap whenever I tried to leave, the Ace died in the basement and the Meg called me a camper in the end-game chat &lt;3
---
Spirit is my favourite killer but somehow I miss more swings with her than I'd like to admit and this does not really happen with any other killers. Maybe something about her animations are off or I don't know but something makes me misjudge my opportunities to hit.
---
Don't play only for farm, you're destroying people's experience with a boring game. Whenever I see a farming killer I want to DC.
---
Yeah this is the standard treatment for such toxicity. That DC though ahahahah. What a toxic rage quit
---
OP BROWN add-ons?
---
With the new Chapter if i remember right
---
Join a Discord SWF or embrace solo queue hell

HOLY SHIT UR BAD

Should be with ghostface
---
As a hag main I love when people say stuff like this lol

I think they're slated to come out with the  3.0.0 mid-chapter update, so it should be about a month and a half.

Do you meg as in he was a killer and his friend was one of the survivors?

---
True tho
---
u bully :c
---
That episode was absolutely wack rigby got smacked by a egg
---
I compmetely get the concept but this creates hesitation among surv aa to when to open the gate or when to cone bodyblock so someone doesn't go down.
---
Just a dash of salt, mostly fun.
---
I have to read up on that. I didn't take him serious until this post
---
It's not for when you lose survivors, it's for mind games. Being able to exactly predict where a survivor is going to be in a sightless loop can get you hits much quicker than you might otherwise.
---
They're part of 3.0.0, afaik. That means they'll come on either the 26th, 3rd, 10th, 17th or 24th.
---
But this is funny (:
---
That's a flaw of the game sadly.
---
I would agree with the point for the early hook. The first hook can be gamechanging. Wont garant a 4kill but can stop survivors from finishing 3 gens at the start. Btw i wouldnt say hag needs a high skill level. Its more like you need mapknowledge. You gotta know where you set your traps. The worst mistake i see people do when playing hag, is that they dont set their traps and chase to long. You dont actually chase with hag. at least not for long.
---
Yeah that's a pretty good way to see it to me, even though I'd add that a good 1K game can feel way better than a bad 2-3K.
---
The problem is I think many killer-centered players either get 4K = a win, or 0-3K = an absolute loss. (maybe consider that 3K is a win too) It's the same problem with survivors that only play full SWF, either they all survive, or it's a loss. It's a sad binary way to view the game and it may be one of the many reasons of the toxicity of the community.
---
tbh, i personally think Hag is the most balanced killer in the game
---
&gt;You might attempt a save with a basement camping LF but you damn sure don't pull it off. Fucking lies just tricklin from that shithole in your face.
---
I specifically said: "*even Leatherface if he is pacing back and forth instead of revving his chainsaw in front of the hook*"
---
So I don't know why you felt the need to say this. There are a few instances where is impossible to save against some killers and basement LF would be one. Guess next time I should list every single one of them to avoid this. 
---
People are downvoting what I said even though it is true. The average survivor is too afraid to make a move even against a Freddy, Wraith or Legion.
---
&gt; It takes what feels like an eternity to crouch up to that hook and once you get them off, you've got another eternity of crouching away 
---
Lmao acting like the dumbass you saved isnt going to immediately sprint away, setting off every trap you avoided.
---
Across the Wednesdays between Chapter 12 and the Mid-Chapter patch.
---
Okay, you're right. I still feel like the art for Legion's addons would've been done before they made Plague's appearance, but yeah idk why I forgot about this.

---
If there isn‚Äôt a ruin... Well. I hit great skill checks constantly.
---
Hag is just facecamping with extra steps.
---
I've always felt that they are slightly centred to the left, since she throws them with her left hand
---
Question: Why Do You Type Like This?
---
Unless they changed it recently, you can proc BL off rocks in Gas Heaven (both survivors and killers can climb em) + doesn't the excavator always spawn?
---
Hag and Spirit can be really scary with jump scares.
---
Seems I got the worst killers out of the way at the start of the event.
---
Same lag switching Bubba twice in a row, a Devour Hope Bubba, a Ebony Mori Trapper, and finished off with an Ebony Mori tunnelling Legion.
---
Yes, I'm waiting for a killer patient. We have Doctor, Nurse. Now I'm waiting for a Patient. With the hospital clothes, and a Syringe in hand, a crazy laugh with every hit, like doctor's laugh when he shocks people.
---
The Patient, put in an instute after violent incidents, thinking they could fix her, but she broke out, escaped and the Entity helped her run free.
---
*Shortly afterwards you hear a heartbeat getting louder and louder*
---
I do not know how to highlight so I will try to format it better.
---
When I say guaranteed win I refer more to more than 2 kills(most killera have the mentality that only a 4k is a win).
---
While you say survivors get better at higher ranks you said as well that pipping as a survivors is easy.That contradicts itself.
---
I was actually complaining about solo queue not killers.
---
Things is as a killer you know you have to do it all even if it hard.As a survivor you have to coordonate with 3 other individuals and that is very hard.That is why swf is so broken if on conpetitive level.
---
Brutal Strength. I got addicted to the fast breaking speed
---
Actually u can use ballance landing on this map 
---
Just find a place
---
At every map u have 1 spot to use it 
---
And its a killer shaq
---
Mind translating to English?Im sorry but I couldnt understand your comment.
---
Bro she‚Äôs dead
---
This is a console playerbase problem.  You're playing with children and dudes who refuse to get jobs and live off their girlfriends until they 'make it in the rap game'.  PC Masterrace has far less of a problem.  :)
---
P3?
---
The other thing I don't understand is why people complain about NOED on the likes of Spirit, even with the move speed buff it gives she still only hits 114% and her phase walking has all kinds of downsides; if this Laurie hadn't been running she'd not have been caught out the first time, it's actually harder to do anything other than simple mindgames than it is to lose the survivor while trying.
---
Though that's more of a "what do you expect a slower killer to do once gens are powered?" concept than relevant to the clip.
---
Gotta love a movie with a happy ending
---
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
---
I didn't say survivors pip easily, I think that was the guy below me. Since the pipping rework, it's much harder to pip. Otherwise, if you're problem is with solo queue, then I agree, it's definitely easier to win as SWF. Just saw the title and thought that was your main argument.
---
Very true statement. Had a killer that I apparently "bullied" before message my p3 Quentin ass "you again". Asked him what and if he wanted to farm. He killed everyone else and let me wouldn't acknowledge that I existed except for basically telling me to get the fuck out when opening the exit gate. I must have pissed this dude off real bad one game
---
Little prick deserved that! 
---
Justice served.
---
When a coordinated survivor group (usually features MoM, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike + Exhaustion Perk \[usually Balanced Landing w/ Haddonfield offering\]) all bring toolboxes (doesn't have to be Brand New Part, an Engineers they got with Plunderers in an earlier match or off the bloodweb works) and one person has Leader (there's usually always a Dwight in there) for maximum repair efficiency while tag-teaming the generators.
---
They pop off faster than you can check more than two or three. (Engineer + Leader + 3-manning a gen is 25 seconds per pop). Their toolbox will last for most of four generators with the common and uncommon charges addons (and they'll just stop at the end) under those circumstances, they'll keep the toolbox to do it again.
---
While they have a designated looper, each of them is usually good enough to keep you occupied for two minutes while they chew through four generators and it doesn't matter if they get injured (adrenaline) or hook farmed (DS) and sometimes one will grab Borrowed Time as well.
---
They don't have to worry about three-genning because they probably save enough of their toolbox to 25-second the fifth generator, which buys you a little more time (3\~ minutes) for them to work through the first four (since it's something like 25+25+33+33 seconds) but really you're kind of screwed.
---
I've had matches go exactly like that, though mine was on Badham instead of Haddonfield. The game ends by the time before you get your second hook most of the time.
---
**And that's the problem: there is no "get good" about it, it's just that the game is set up where it's mechanically difficult to succeed as the Killer; even a loosely coordinated non-SWF that sticks together through lobby chat agreement can have 80% of their game done before you get 2 of the the 12 hooks you need.**
---
Play fair?When killers use moris they tell us to git gud at the game.If it is in the game it is fair.Whether it is overpowered it is a completely differemt question.
---
Laurie/Jane and huntress
---
you couldn't have a find a more deserving survivor to get moried
---
As I said, her Basement Game is absolutely devastating. An unorganised escape is probably not possible. The counter would be not getting there in the first place. She is slow and can't carry you far. If she downs you a small distance away from the basement and she tries one simple body block would ruin her whole intention.  
---
The number occasions where I got a Basement hook in Red Ranks and kept it running are 0.
---
Borrowed Time, MoM, DS are her worst enemies. Also Urban Evasion can be tricky. 
---
But if I break down a Situation where you get hooked in the Basement the first thing you do is to keep struggle. I know its not fun but you give your Team 120 seconds to do stuff (60 seconds for each hook phase). A Generator needs around 80 Seconds for a single Survivor. With Ruin and unlucky Skillchecks around 120 Seconds.  
---
So while your fellow Survivors setup a rescue or working on gens the Hag needs to be in Teleport proximity. She can't teleport that far actually, only with addons.   
---
In Theory she does nothing the whole Time or begins a new Chase. If she commits to a Chase a 3rd Survivor crouches into the basement and you both crouch out. Stay behind the healthy Survivor and you both should be able to leave.
---
Thats the worst case Scenario and the premise is every Survivor knows what to do and doesn't waste time with just crouching around the Basement and waiting for an opportunity.   
---
Often the Survivor bring the right Perks to pull it of much easier or swarm the basement triggering all the traps aggressively so the Hag needs to chose between a Chase or re-setting all her traps. That costs her Time and Emblem points. Or they find a Flashlight in a chest.
---
&gt;How do you counter her when she puts you into the basement and lays like 3 traps all along the place
---
If she just puts 3 Traps in Front of your hook its as good as one. If she puts one in Front and one on the Stairs and one in the door upstairs she won't be able to teleport to all of them if you just run. She can't teleport while she is in her "after-Hit" cooldown state. Also she can't Teleport rapidly from Phantasm to Phantasm. 
---
&gt;If her trap is destroyed she gets a notification, by the time you unhook she'll be back.
---
Again, she's slow and easily looped. I mean thats the the Game. There is no Killer who just lets you unhook, heal and hide again. The Notifications don't give her that much of a Time advantage against the unhook Notification itself that should come immediately afterwards.
---
Kinda remind me of the movie orphan
---
I love Urban Evasion.
---
I have done all kinds of wacky shit with it, it's good on so many maps since most of them have expanses of low obstacles. I've been caught on a generator but the killer goes to chase the other person, doesn't quite glimpse me, and I ride it to 100% right there.
---
I've juked Hags and Mikes by slipping away from the direction I was sprinting, slipped around Nurses, Clowns, and Doctors (Docs are definitely harder to slip around though), hopped right back on a generator just two seconds after it's been kicked and gotten away with it.
---
Urban Evasion is really great in a chase where you double back after breaking LOS for two seconds in a pinch, as well.
---
Time to die, ungrateful
---
Pretty good. Looks like.. 4 BPS and a fully stacked of BBQ?
---
Your other post already got taken down, might not wanna self promo on here, people don't tend to like it
---
Doesn't change the fact that BBQ is milloin times better than WGLF.
---
Legion is worse
---
I don‚Äôt know. I have over 1200 hours and all killers 50 some with P1-3 and have never received one of those from a web.
---
Completely agree.
---
Does SG mean Singapore in this context or am I misinterpreting this?
---
I've always found it cool when people come up with detailed suggestions with perks etc. I might as well give it a shot
---
No worries, it was news to me as well.
---
Love when people do that. Sorry my WiFi is 10mb and can‚Äôt even handle basic functions most of the time.
---
Ace and Myers.
---
I like how you censored the mori
---
I'm pretty sure you can't get them if you own the killer. I have never seen one show up.
---
I found the survive with friends t-bagger that got moried!
---
Same here man.
---
Send me your written fan chapter. I want to read it
---
Tho true
---
See I don't want to camp either, it messes up my Emblem.
---
If you leave them there to hang and rot for the whole two minutes even when I'm not camping I will take it easy on you. If I hook you and no one pings on BBQ&amp;C? I will still beeline away from that hook as long as the hook farmer is still on their hook (or perhaps in general for a hook or two, there is obviously an upper limit).
---
If that guy is still on his hook, I might not kick your generator after catching you. Or I might let you get that generator even though I could totally three-gen.
---
I don't want to just stare at the hook for two minutes because the survivor was a douche, but I'll give other leeway. Also if you want to farm him off the hook I will count to 10 for the safe unhook and then smack him back down.
---
 Where is get this
---
What the fuck is happening here
---
I'm confused how you'd use her power. She stops a survivor moving for 1 second, but gets stunned for 3? Aren't you just losing ground by doing that?
---
Why dc when two of us used party streamers that just get the blood points and move on to the next game
---
as a wraith main i love running nurses calling on him. given that he has no terror radius when he‚Äôs cloaked, and survivors tend to hide behind something to heal and therefore obscure their field of view, nurses calling has netted me so many hooks and sacrifices because somebody is off self caring behind a wall and can‚Äôt see me running in their direction.
---
plus, you‚Äôd be surprised how many people self care in the basement. it‚Äôs astounding.
---
if you don‚Äôt have the points for the teachable from nurse, consider running bloodhound instead! it‚Äôs a fantastic tracking perk and before i got nurses, it had a spot on my loadout.
---
something to help him in chases is an absolute must, though. wraith is fun to play but not particularly powerful, and his power doesn‚Äôt help him out much unless you‚Äôre running add-ons that decrease his uncloaking speed so you can catch up cloaked and hit a survivor down. i‚Äôm going to echo the recommendation of enduring; it works against all stuns, including flashlight burns, which is important with wraith because they‚Äôre really annoying lmao
---
Sickening stun üëåüèº
---
How long did it take for you to get 1 mil BP?
---
My low iq didnt worked there and i didnt expected the killer to jump the window:( then i realize that i fucked up
---
I'm gonna have to stop you right there and call you on your bullshit. It takes A LOT of different reports on different things from different people, unless you're being racist or soliciting pornography, and even then more than half the time nothing gets done, before they suspend someone's account even for just a day.
---
Like 5 matches
---
Thanks!
---
You can do it once per minute, in my opinion not worth a perk slot.
---
Nope, not really. Legion and billy are my mains
---
But because i am very good with billy i mostly get chainsaws. Because of that i may have 8k in deviousness but u get like 3-4k in brutality
---
BHVR have had 3 years to figure out literally any system to make DCs not ruin matches or properly punish people for doing it. People can complain about it.
---
Oink
---
There should be a tracker that locks you out of DCing if your record shows you disconnect too many times once dedicated servers come out.
---
There was a patch a long while ago that changed lunges so that it is the same for all killers mostly due to the 110 killers and Nurse having shorter lunges, with nurses being basically a tap lunge, and they also removed Nurse's omega post blink lunge for a normal lunge when she got slightly changed to function better with multi level maps
---
No need to defend yourself. Yeah you didn't play the best but in the end you don't have to. I was just making an argument. Next time tho, if you really play mostly survivor you know how frustrating the 3 things are. At least turn it down a little. You don't have to play without all of them but it's a little overkill
---
I hope they add back the physics asapppppp
---
I don't know who's downvoted you, but I'm on 127/128 at the moment with "Taking One For The Team" being the last one to get. The Adept killer achievements are FAR from the hardest ones to get. They're a bit frustrating at times for sure, but you're totally right in saying there are worse ones to get.
---
MY Source [u/JosetvndRice/](https://www.reddit.com/user/JosetvndRice/)
---
They also released stats recently that SWF only makes up 10% of games. That was a very eye opening number. Biggest issue is that they never balanced the game around swf. Because of that, solo survivors are basically punished. I play 50/50 killer and survivor,  but solo survivor is just as bad as facing a 4 man swf with skill. It can be infuriating,  but there is always another match minutes away.
---
Hags and Doctors are my least favorite to play against. I never get a single killer who plays them who isn‚Äôt toxic in some manner, either by facecampin and spamming shock, or camping even though the hags ability basically makes camping pointless???
---
I know realistically that I just have bad luck, but seriously I‚Äôve gotten so many more toxic doctors and hags than ANY OTHER KILLER and I rarely get one that‚Äôs fun to play against so i just have this overwhelming bias and every time I start to get camped by one of them I can partially understand why people used to constantly DC against legion just because they didn‚Äôt like going against him. 
---
I still don‚Äôt DC bc,, bloodpoints,, but Jesus is the urge there sometimes
---
4 boxes, 1 killer. Pig can be at the wrong box. It's a chance thing. Especially since a while ago they improved the distance between them so they're not all 2 feet away from each other again. There can be as many as 6 boxes on the map at 1 time with stacked add-ons. Again, each person can only be in one place at a time. 
---
You still have a chance to get out without being found.
---
To be fair if you had to get a splinter atleast be glad it is for Oink girl.
---
RBT timer pauses while in a chase

They‚Äôll tell you to use VC, not all the devs are like Queen apparently, McLean is a real nasty troll that sets a bad example for the community and makes fun of his chat users that will have a differing opinion when he knows he is right and they are wrong and will mock them.
---
No wonder this game has been a shit show, he plays pretty dirty as well and will only let the last survivor go when he knows he‚Äôs being a dick on stream
---
Gotta say I was guilty of this myself, and its ALWAYS Devour that gets destroyed.
---
May be they thought I was "humble bragging" but I was simply stating why I know there are harder achievements out there. 
---
Of course, as you have been there and done that, you understand me better. :)
---
'Take one for the team' shouldn't take you long, do a lot of body blocking and that should get it. 
---
All the best! Bask in the feeling of 100 percenting the game before Ghost brings his 3 achievements.
---
Pig can still zone them fairly easily and figure out which one hasn't been done yet.
---
Oooooo noed gamer.Very interesting.Tell me more.What do you want us to say?
---
Lol yup.  I still remember crab walking through the shack, all the way down the stairs and to the hook, and as soon as I pulled his dumbass down, he took off running straight up the steps and popped like three traps.  I didn't go for the second unhook.
---
Not everyone has $5 to spare unfortunately:/
---
She's on the same tier as Freddy IMO. Instant disconnect whenever I run into her. No fun to play against what so ever.

Gen rushing is refusing to help your team out in any manner besides just doing the gens as fast as possible. For example- say someone is hooked, and the killer isn‚Äôt camping. If the entire team just does gens and refuses to save the hooked survivor, that‚Äôs gen rushing. Or at least that‚Äôs what I always interpreted it to be. As a killer main now basically, I don‚Äôt call things like them getting the gens done super fast before I find anybody gen rushing I just call that them working together and me not being able to find them lmao
---
And then you get hit
---
Spirit over in the corner going ‚ÄúWAHHHHHHHHHHH‚Äù!
---
So just rape?
---
Imo yes. Monitor is still increased terror radius when you down someone and with the dead rabbit even higher, before they know you have infectious you can usually get 2 or 3 people downed on your first T3, after that (assuming there is an after that) they panic and try to stay away from each other if they're sensible. Seriously good for pressure.
---
Also praise Atua, he will deliver us from this killing game.

Just because it's on YouTube doesn't mean you can pay in 'exposure'
---
i mean those maps have a few hills for balanced landing, you just need to know where to run
---
That would also save a few people's keyboards.
---
But I don't think it'd do much when it comes to being facecamped.
---
Well ofc I'm talking about if you're a survivor not killer. If you're playing killer you dictate wether there's farming or not. I'm not saying it takesw priority in the sense that it's more important or valid then what you are doing. It's just that there's literally no point to just go around and rush the gens while the other 4 people in your game are farming. All you are doing is hurting your rank and getting far less bloodpoints. If it's more fun to just power the gate and leave fair enough
---
If farming was a common thing it would be horrible. It's just people would rather play along when there can be upwards of a 500% bloodpoint modifier. I do understand where you're coming from tho
---
You can't tell which box has or hasn't been done unless youre near one when it's laughing if it isn't the right nox for the survivor or they panic and run from it. There's no way of knowing. Just stealth it. They're patrolling the boxes. If they don't see you at or near one they move onto the next one as hanging around 1 box excessively is a waste of time. 
---
You either find them or they get it off on the first or second box the come to.
---
I'll post the whole thing when it's done
---
I love a happy ending.
---
I played 5 4-man swf games today and got tunnelled in all of them
---
this meme is a mood rn
---
Why are the teabaggers always the worst ones. I mean, if you have to teabag you should at least be somewhat decent at the game. Its just embarassing and pathetic
---
7-10mins a match + 10-15 minutes per queue x 5
---
There used to be a bug (a year ago or so) where they gave out splinters like crazy. I have all splinters on my Freddy even tho i have all DLCs.
---
It's 100% going to be worse than the current 0ms ping as killer
---
bloodhunt be like

Quote of the day.
---
Me too.
---
all is well in love and war......I mean murder
---
Agreed. As of right now, there's literally no point to them after the gates are powered. If I have any left I'm literally just slapping them on for the BP. They were always meant to slow the game down, if they don't serve that function anymore what is even the point.
---
Terry hates campers
---
I get that but not all killers can be top tier.It is impossible.
---
OP is a poet
---
I'm glad to hear that you support the idea
---
Legion with ruin, thanatophobia, sloppy butcher.  
---
The most boring matches possible in this game.
---
Oh for sure, if I'm survivor I might as well get involved to some degree. But if they're running around knocking down pallets for too long, I'm not necessarily gonna gen rush - but I will start doing the gens, if it looks like I'm going to be bored for 15 minutes. Life's too short.
---
That's a weird looking shirtless david
---
If you‚Äôve actually read through the comment section you‚Äôd know
---
I‚Äôm all ears alerts fast vaults inside 48, so it can counter quick and quiet or other survivors fast vaulting.
---
I like reading other people's fanchapter. Sometimes I also post my fanchapters.
---
If you use Blood Warden even one second less than 60 seconds left in Endgame it's an instant kill for everyone left on the map. It's ridiculous they nerfed Pig's main ability but couldn't be bothered to do the same for a single perk that reliably results in more kills.
---
IKR , they literally tested survivors without perks vs everykiller without perk and only killer who was able to win was the nurse . As a person who plays the wraith , after they add object of obsession I feel like my killer is like a trapper who doesnt use his traps or a billy who doesnt use his chainsaw , you get the idea .
---
Fucking surv mains started bitching about ghostface because he is half as decent as nurse now after the buffs . I'm waiting for ghostface so badly because he is an improved version of wraith .
---
No, instead it alerts you of any fast vault within a48 meter radius, so goodbye quick and quiet
---
You mathed off but. Leader does jack shit to gens now buddy.
---
Oh that could be it, my Freddy is only 15
---
Not only that but it's shown from statistics that the RBTs get taken off in the first three boxes I think over 75% of the time. Even slowing the endgame timer like if someone is downed or hooked would be better than making her useless.
---
thats.....not really a reason for me to use that perk tbh
---
Didn‚Äôt say you had to.
---
His perks are C to D tier in my opinion so yeah
---
Looks like wind? Can you see the wind irl?
---
ye, but this still makes the perk feel pretty useless
---
Lauries
---
No Terry hates nobody. But Terry loves fair play.
---
Yeah, Blood Warden probably aught to be nerfed a little too. That's what I thought, the second I heard about Endgame. Maybe there could be a second, right at the end of the timer, where the barrier vanishes? That's be pretty fun and intense...
---
Yee
---
I'm not super toxic because that's a dick move.
---
Clearly, he was ready to dc...smh, I question why ppl play the game some times.
---
Me when an iridescent head huntress tunneled me :)
---
honestly, as a survivor main, I don‚Äôt really see this as a toxic move.
---
 In fact, it happened to me about 3 times today, and I didn‚Äôt really care (granted, I wasn‚Äôt in front of the hatch for 2 of those times, but you get the idea). I feel like there‚Äôs this real toxic mindset with survivors where if they are the last survivor alive, the killer has to give them hatch, like they ‚Äòdeserve it‚Äô. And if they don‚Äôt, they are immediately a ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô killer when the survivor has been way more toxic for the majority of the trial.
---
 And the problem with survivors teabagging at the exit gates is more of a mocking move. I see closing the hatch in front of a dying survivor more of like the killer securing their 4K, not mocking the survivor, insisting on how terrible he is.
---
 I guess the problem here is that some survivors are massive hippocrits where they act as toxic as they possibly can to the killer, but when the killer does something like close the hatch in-front of them, immediately they‚Äôre the victim and now the killer is the one being toxic. It‚Äôs really just annoying seeing these people on the game.
---
Yea i don't get it either i mean im a wraith main and i always close the hatch and every time they call me a "toxic" im just doing what a killer is supposed to do
---
If I've had a good match, with no BMs from the last player and if they dont wiggle (having accepted their fate) I like to do the same. Unless I need their hook for BBQ points :o
---
Why 108%
---
those survivors are massive hippocrits lmao
---
No. Because these files are not encrypted like the rest of the game files, you can't get banned for it since you aren't messing with the actual game files.
---
Besides that, if it were ban-able, not many people would stream themselves using custom icons.
---
Isn‚Äôt the whole point of you guys getting shafted when it comes to servers because there actually isn‚Äôt a large gaming community? I know CSGO players are currently struggling in OCE because matchmaking is so unbalanced due to lack of players available to balance the lobbies. PUBG also didn‚Äôt introduce FPP to OCE mode for like a year due to lack of players and that was the number one game played on steam at the time.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right I‚Äôm just noticing a pattern.
---
Because claudette has an advantage most other survivors dont in her stealth capabilities. If I had to choose between a claudette and any other character barring outside circumstances (perks, how they play, etc.) I would go after the claudette 90% of the time. Because if I can catch her out and get her in a chase I have a much higher chance of getting her dead.
---
Omg PLEASE BHVR
---
I don‚Äôt understand why hag isn‚Äôt s tier. Maybe it‚Äôs just hypocritical coming from a hag main but Jesus is she good to play with.
---
Why would you ever want to rank up? Have you seen what's up there? Frankly, if BHVR were to put me at rank 20 and keep me there I'd be ok with it for the rest of my life.
---
#PK FIRE
---
Ok thanks for your advice
---
You're welcome c:
---
That‚Äôs still tunneling, there‚Äôs no denying it. Whenever I play Claudette I use the hallowed blight cosmetic there no hiding with a strobe light on your chest and hand.
---
It might cause a ban from the anti cheat software side. Developers said if you do get banned for changing icons they will not be able to do anything about it. 
---
Although, nobody got banned for them and plenty of popular streamers are using them all the time. Personally, I am sceptical because one day there might be an update to the anti cheat and we might end up with a massive ban wave of people with modified game files. 
---
If developers said it's safe I would certainly use them. But it's like someone telling you stop smoking weed because it could kill you, I haven't read about anyone dying from it.
---
The fact that Feral Frenzy cannot be used while the gauge is not full was changed because Legion could just hit survivors any moment and the reason that frenzy does not reduce the timer is because there was not a counterplay. Don't.
---
Oh give me a break , I'm only against a wraith and i only have object of obsession , decisive strike , dead hard and mettle of man , did i mention i have 20 pallets that im going to loop arround till my buddies rush 5 gens under 5 minutes . Playing survivor is hard heuweuwehewuweh . It's so hard to run arround pallets 3 times and then dropping them to run towards another pallet hueeeeeeeeeeeee . Hey developers , ghost face is able to use his ability now , you made him decent  , please revert him so he no longer can stalk anyone . Hueeeeee T-T
---
You can do that if they were toxic though btw lmao
---
"If it is in the game it is fair." This has to be the most incorrect thing I have ever seen on this subreddit. If everything in a game was fair just because it was in it, then why would devs be updating to balance things? Yeah, you are allowed to use overpowered stuff, its not a crime, but its cheap and creates an unfun experience. I agree with you that moris are bullshit, but you cant sit there and try to justify insta-heals and Mettle of Man being fair, especially when paired with voice comms of a swf team, which aren't part of the game.
---
That's a built in mechanic in the game.
---
Sorry yall fell for it
---
I really want Pinhead to make an appearance.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests
---
No. Only if the killer doesn‚Äôt want to rank up or doesn‚Äôt know how the game works. The killer gets more points for hooking you all 3 times. Killing yourself on your first hook is actually probably slightly worse than disconnecting because you‚Äôre denying a lot of points from the killer whereas disconnecting at least gives some points.
---
yeah they were working together, they would put me on the hook then take me off then hit me right when i was off
---
Really epic, very cool 10/10

From what I understand, they'll come tomorrow alongside Ghostface.
---
I didn‚Äôt say anything about obligation? I‚Äôm just saying how gameplay is pretty shitty and he humble brags like crazy for tunneling/slugging
---
Honestly wasn't that satisfying to me. The Laurie that was mori'd only teabagged at the end after the unhook almost like she knew she was going to be tunneled.
---
It would've been satisfying if the first Laurie that made you whiff twice then proceeded to hump the harvester got mori'd.
---
I had a game where I was obsession and spirit had rancor, man was I releaved when someone else used DS and got mori'd instead of me.
---
Voice comms are bullshit yeah but you chose to play with them.You could be one of those guys that dodge every swf and stop complaining about them at all.In fact try that  for a day and see how much you actually win.

So the reason the community is full of crybabies that rage and DC is this one guy being *mildly* annoying? Really?

He was also mori'd, it was a form of karma

I think the code just does that normally

Why are you all surprised? Every map has a zone full of lockers.

Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôve got so many downvoted, this is a pretty meta build and by no means ‚Äúgood‚Äù in my opinion. Points for using whispers I guess?
---
Im not playing just so they know I could have won. Also, giving them 8k means I dont get my 1-2k. They should have played better if they wanted more points.
---
Uhhhh yes, I know from experience that they do. Its typically only the really sweaty survivors. Im fine with people playing with their friends, but when survivors are min/maxing everything and sweating really hard as a 4 stack with the best perks and add ons, its just straight up not fun for the killer and even the best killer players in the world would agree that playing against a 4 stack using the best possible resources, is practially impossible to pip if the survivors are good.
---
\&gt;disconnecting mid-mori
---
God no I couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse,
---
When did this switch over to survivor toxicity? I‚Äôm talking killer now. Don‚Äôt change the subject in favor of your argument.
---
Finally
---
Well I tbag as well but only if i want to show that im friendly
---
15mins? I quit playing for a while but I remember having to wait about 2 hours during the Halloween event.
---
No its not. Matchmaking at similar times makes this possible. I came up against a guy who would unhook me in front of the killer. Using bond and empathy selling us out all 3 of us. I checked after game the two were friends. So yeah its possible.
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted I do this too
---
The other guy is correct. They are *slightly* aimed to the left of the center of your screen, but not too much. I too play on console, so I get it. The first twenty or so matches I played with her, I nearly gave up, because I was missing every hatchet. Then I figured out the most convenient places to throw, and got a little better at freehand aiming.
---
Lmao, looks like Gumball xD
---
Yeah, and?
---
They played fair. Now if the killer brought and Ebony or pink add-ons then it's a different story smh
---
Its reddit in a nut shell my brother. You aren't allowed to have a differing opinion than the hive mind or you get downvoted to hell. Even though downvoting is supposed to be about irrelevant comments or posts. But nah let's just downvote brigade anyone with a slightly different opinion.
---
I was told they were exactly in the middle of your screen. But thank you for telling me I hope it‚Äôll feel kore comfortable now that I know where it‚Äôs aimed.
---
Doctor runs up like "Cease this fagotry"
---
The fact that you need a full gauge to use your power works with every gauge power killers (Spirit, Myers, Plague...). This was added because Legion could just vault every pallet any time and hit the survivor with no counterplay. The change makes more sense.
---
Hey the reason we‚Äôre thinking it‚Äôs a stranger things chapter is because Netflix is really trying to promote it. With it coming to fortnite and possibly dbd It will gain more viewers and make season 3 even more of a hit.
---
I mean items are items and perks are perks. Is it unfair to use iradescent head with huntress?  As far as SWFs goes its proven they have a low escape rate. Its not this huge advantage people claim it to be. If anything I would say it helps balance the game because otherwise the killer is the favorite to win.
---
Proof or link?
---
I love hearing ppl make fake accusations trash talk, it's one of my favorites parts about killer and id love to make it easier to chat after the game
---
They're clearly talking about machine gun Huntress, duh.
---
He got shot
---
Three slugged and you are power dropping the fourth to force a release..... Exit gate Tea party, get gud baby killer. You can't win with some players.
---
At least t-bag is just used to troll and distract you, nothing really to complain ; I mean it doesn't prevent you to play and win.
---
Idk what youre saying. But yeah I dont treat moris as unfair.
---
Technically correct, haha. But yeah, that's a load of points.
---
New headcanon, Cephalon Simaris is actually the entity, the sanctuary is the entity‚Äôs realm.
---
I mean when  your in the basement if you crouch the hag will be there by the time you crouched all the way out, if you set off the trap then she teleports, it's a lose lose, her basement is very strong and can only be countered by flashlights or being lucky enough that the killer shack is in one corner of the map and hag is in the other
---
Begone THOT
---
xP True for me, not the Survivors *cue evil theme music* But yea, was suuuper stoked to rack up some larger points, it's a hit or miss kinda thing depending on the type of Survivors ya get!
---
I play both. And normally win ever fame as the killer usually with all survivors sacrificed. But the problem is I mostly want to play with my friends as a survivor which is just so frustrating and ridiculous now
---
Im not saying that killers don't also have overpowered add ons. Obviously they statistically don't have a low winrate, because most swf groups are just people casually playing with friends, not every survive with friends group is like these guys in the picture, but when you have teams like these guys in the picture, yes, it is absoultely unfair and I bet if they playing like this consistently their winrate is insane. Statistics don't generalize everyone into a median, just think about it.
---
I guess im wrong. I just went to find a link but wherever I read it is gone. Must of been in the flurry of E3 and reporters just trying to get anything out. Appears the mobile game is being made by NextGames. So maybe the collaboration is for DbD
---
No I ate them all
---
What about wraith and nurse?
---
tea bagging ain‚Äôt fair unless everyone is saying hello that way. i wish survivors knew this.
---
Hell, fuck them.
---
I normally play with at least one friend. Still normally impossible to win
---
True but if you are in a chase you'll not have a chance to use the boxes either. 
---
Unless a very specific scenario you won't die to the end game timer.
---
Prestiged 3 times :)
---
I really feel they missed an opportunity for a 3x BP weekend, you know, to celebrate 3 years? No? Okay. :-(
---
Yeah but now it affects all survivors even at the lowest tier of it. And if they camp on the totem it can make the game like instantly over. ü§¶
---
when hovering over her default cosmetics it reads "what's left of what she wore that night"
---
maybe there's a possibility he shredded her clothes along with cutting her limbs off yknow
---
Sad you get way more bp multihooking and chasing. I never face camp,  during double dp I take great care to not hook survivors more then once and back off my preasure once I get all 4 once and just chase or would them until they escape.
---
honestly, it's only reasonable if you're getting tunneled or chased extremely hard and need your team to rush gens.
---
I usually do, but BP weekend has me greedy
---
1) I would much prefer the cooldown addons be reverted to what they were before but I could somewhat go with this as well.
---
2) I'm personally fine with the darkness of the cooldown I don't think that needs to be changed especially if you're going to reduce the cooldown itself.
---
3) I would love this change considering they already slower then what they used to be and you can't spam hit people anymore so I don't see why this is too much of an issue
---
4) Nope if you're going to reduce the cooldown down and allow you to use it before it's fully powered up you're not having this effect as well. It will make the Legion just like how they were before which is not what you want.
---
5) Considering the changes above (with the exception of number four) are all really good I don't think you need this edition.
---
6) the add-on needs to be reworked completely in its current state it doesn't combine well with the new kit or benefit the legion and I don't think they need to have their ability to down survivors with frenzy added to the base kit again so just rework this add-on completely.
---
7) I agree with this one completely.
---
Some pretty decent ideas then however 
---
Damage to the deep wound bar is a massive no. 
---
If you're going add the consistent usage of frenzy without it being fully powered and reduced the cooldown you're going to need a way to escape the Legion the darkness would be a good tool to slip away from them and play stealth so it shouldn't change
---
With the other changes the increasing vault speed would be unnecessary. It rubs too many counter options which was Legion's problem to begin with
---
Franks mixtape also need to just a complete rework as it doesn't help the new legion and it's very counterproductive like with the current pin add-ons so your change the pin add-ons is well needed but Cranks mixtape can't stay the same
---
actually you can disable that (i'm a hidden mobile user)
---
She actually did teabag before the unhook.
---
Don't be such a weenie...
---
You get hills on these. Shelter woods is where it's at.
---
&gt;They keep nerfing survior perks to make it harder for us
---
They recently buffed Borrowed Time and in tomorrows patch they indirectly buffed Decisive Strike with Enduring change (which is good).
---
I won't even bothering wasting more time in this low IQ troll thread.
---
Omfg does no one read my post? I literally said you are never meant to win every single round. And no if the killers are camping and lag switch which about ninety six percent seem to do now on top of op-ed perks on. It literally makes the game unfair and unbalanced. To where you don't even get a fair chance at winning. Hence my point. That it uset to be an even match that made the game fun. You won some you lost some. But you at least had fun playing. But if you have a lag switching or camping killer with certain perks it literally takes all of the fun out of the game
---
Doesn‚Äôt the survivor getting healed wake up if you mess up a skill check on them?
---
When the meme lacks a caption.
---
I agree with everything here besides. Leader. That perk is practically useless and it doesnt affect gens
---
Learn from this, ace/claudette mains.
---
Ok, that's some funny stuff, you made me laugh when i'm having a bad day, thank you :)
---
My bad i know it used to at least.
---
They've been improving the totem placements(*most* of them), so I don't see a problem with them atm. I don't see a reason for the killer to waste their time going around the map and trying to find a suitable totem location.
---
This was beautiful.
---
Survivors drops a pallet on me and tbags?
---
*Welcome to Tunnel city*
---
Get a caption.
---
Imagine placing 4 totems... for a reasonable price of 5 gens lost
---
Another dude who didn't even read my entire post before commenting. ü§¶
---
I love Hag. She gives the best jumpscares in the game and she's a really strong killer. Very tactical, not brute force like Nurse.
---
Wiping the blood off mostly
---
And Hag probably had MYC &lt;3
---
Why would you post at 2AM? thats when most "oinkers" are asleep
---
That's what survivors would say to killer who complained about looping, even though looping occurred before the plet is dropped.
---
its also funny because their mother dies
---
I know, I just don‚Äôt have the 5 atm
---
Last time I saw it, someone used a yellow flashlight yea and we we were 2 using toolbox. But we played casually, we weren't in (vocal) group, and did nothing to deserve that.
---
Oh and I remember using a boost points for everyone.
---
Killer replyied it was to counter the *only one flashlight*.
---
Hm.
---
The Creeper from Jeepers Creepers
---
There's always at least one hill and the crane so Gas Heaven isn't that bad.
---
You can doubt all you want, but I would suggest actually watching them play over sharing your own uninformed opinion first.  Top level players are interested in maxing out the emblem system and BP gains, tunneling survivors will more often than not result in achieving neither of these things, especially at higher ranks.  You need to separate the difference between a killer killing all 4 survivors and a killer killing all survivors masterfully.
---
Yeah but not everyone can hit great checks. So if there is only me in the lobby who can and they camp on the totem then lag switch me down. Literally no one else has a chance to get it done. Hence my point of its bad enough with killer perks. But since most killers camp and lag switch now too. It's ridiculous
---
I drop em by the hatch, close the hatch, then I chase them cuz they have adrenaline and get more points for hitting them. Then hook em cuz bloodpoints
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be frustrating, I‚Äôm frustrated every time as a killer, every game I tell myself this is going to be a chill game I end up going full try-hard because a survivor gets cocky. It‚Äôs kind of the point in these games, I stopped playing Rainbow six siege for a while because of frustration and anxiety. You want a ez game then play kill your friends and orchestrate your game without ruin.
---
Oh god, I bringin the big guns for this one.
---
Paradise would be the Double BP Event having at least every other game that way
---
Yup, even Nurse has the same MS as the Trapper when carrying a surv \^\_\^  
---
For that reason agitation on Hag is actually toxic :D
---
Thank you at least you get it. I mean I have no problem against losing to an awesome killer who beats me with their own skill. But if you have to camp or lag switch to win on top of those perks. Then you're just a trash killer who ruins the fun of the game
---
These maps are worse, on Shelter Woods you can proc it from the tree in the middle and a couple of rocks.
---
The rule I play by now is that win or lose I just say GG and only engage in the chat if they are nice or giving tips.
---
not most Killers Camp and almost no one lag switches.....most People that seem to do that are either just lagging normally, or you had a Bad ping from the beginning.
---
And even if you hit 0 greats you still get the gen done, as its completly random if you even get skill checks at all
---
No problem brother
---
Facts
---
Everybody gangsta until a phantasm trap gets activated and everyone gets downed in one minute
---
I get that but it's just when you have killers who camp and lag switch on top of those perks it's just ridiculous. I mean kick my ass cause you're an awesome killer I have no problem with it. Makes the match fun. But if you're gonna camp or lag switch. You're just trash who doesn't deserve the win you're getting that way
---
I figured that was with it being double bp weekend.

Play like a bitch

My playtime is 90% killer (1,4k hrs) and I can easily tell you: it works. 
---
Enduring is god tier as you can force the drop and ignore the stun.
---
All the high quality shit has the weirdest fetishses.
---
BUT MY 50 EXTRA BOLDNESS POINTS
---
Isn't Grindr scary enough? :)
---
Skill checks are client sided so even if he lag switches, it doesn‚Äôt benefit Ruin in any way. (Thank god for that tbh)
---
I can understand the frustration, you die to stupid ass killers cause of a dumb lag on their end as they host, it sucks.
---
Tbh I only farm when there are 2 toxic survivors and they DC. The other two don't deserve to go through that suffering because of shitty people.
---
No it's cause I'm literally saying if the perks are op-ed there is literally no reason to camp or lag switch to win. Yet ninety six percent of killers do exactly that and ruin the fun of the game. Which you idiots keep skipping in my post. Hence me even having to edit if yet you all keep ignoring it. I don't care losing to an awesome killer who beats me by skill. But if you have those perks and have to camp or lag to win. You're trash that doesn't deserve the win you're getting that way
---
I'm trying to learn how to be a good console nurse, one entity displeased at a time.
---
I've learned that a killers attack works like a hitscan weapon. If you do a normal swing, if there's a survivor in view and in range, you get a hit. Lunges work a little bit differently in that theres only a hit scan on the end of a running wind-up attack, so i would suggest only using lunges when you're absolutely sure that you'll close the distance to get a hit and use the normal swing most often.
---
Stop getting found first?
---
"That grimy old disgusting witch?" Isn't Lisa a young woman that was flayed alive?
---
I seriously don't get the camping and tunneling complaints. So you're mad the killer seems focused on you? If you're hurt you're leaving a blood trail why wouldn't he focus on taking you out. Camping? Go work on generators. If you keep bumrushing the hooked survivor why would a killer even leave the area and try to find someone when you go right to them.
---
I thought the devs stated at some point that the bloodweb spawning better items after prestige didnt work?
---
KiLLeR bAd CuZ uSe MeTa PeRkS

Always a nice change after several matches of sweaty killers and bad teammates.
---
I don‚Äôt need to read your entire post to know you offer nothing useful to any conversation. Whine away, baby boy, and enjoy being a terrible player instead of improving.
---
firstly rank 5-8 is pretty average, nothing special....
---
Second, I read your Post and the only thing in there is that you have a Problem with ruin, which normally only beginners have
---
no, the surivvor wasnt even that good, killer was just bad
---
I personally love reverse rape and futanari but never been able to got into ugly bastard
---
Even tho I am actually looking like an ugly bastard myself
---
Huh
---
It's an objective truth that the skill ceiling for the Hag is high and that the skill floor is also high. But the same can be said about other killers too and because people neglect to take the skill ceiling of other killers into consideration. People just assume that since Hag has such high potential, it is automatically one of the best.
---
However, if you compare all of the killers with the assumption that the player playing it is playing it to its fullest, it is much easier to perform better playing killers like the nurse, hillbilly and even killers like trapper would technically be next level crazy if you knew where to put traps every time. 
---
If we use this as a basis of judging tiers for killers, Hag would not be in the top two. If S class is tier 1, A class tier 2, She'd be either last on the A tier (with addons) or first on the B tier (without addons).
---
However, if we're judging Hag's ability to perform well based on a skill level of an above average killer player, she'd be well into the mid tiers or perhaps even the lower tiers. 
---
However I still feel like the insanely high skill floor and dependency on basement plays and addons plays a huge role in determining the rating of Hag's performance as a killer. 
---
It is much easier to play, learn and perform well on killers like hillbilly and spirit than it is on Hag. And when your entire power gets negated by a single perk, it is quite hard to proclaim Hag as being an unstoppable force when played to its fullest.
---
You can actually see certain survivors through the little grates at the top when ur playing any of the tall killers
---
Yeah if they can hit great checks but most survivors can't hence why if they camp and lag on top of the perks it can be an guaranteed win for killers usually which ruins the fun of the game. I have no problem losing to an awesome skilled killer but it you have to do that to win you're garbage
---
I have all perks on my P1 Nea who is currently my main. It takes a metric fuck ton of bloodpoints to get every survivor perk. For tier 3 survivor perks, there are 46 purple (very rare), and 19 green (rare) total.
---
I wonder if we'll ever get a survivor clip on this sub where the survivor knows how to look behind them in a chase.
---
The hit was 100% fair because you need to take ping in consideration. In the killers screen your character is always a few miliseconds behind, depending on how high the ping is. 
---
The second part, not being able to heal, looks like an annoying bug.
---
i remember the first time i went against a pig and saw something crouching towards me. i was like, ‚Äúhey, a random! let‚Äôs work on a gen‚Äù and my friend at the time yelled ‚Äúomsnoms, that‚Äôs not a survivor!‚Äù
---
good times. i got face camped that game
---
damn, throwing hard facts here
---
yes
---
Happened last game I played watched a bra drop it when the killer wasn't even close behind her
---
Dont need to look behind me if i know where she is. Also she has a lullaby
---
You seem to misunderstand- people can read your inane ramblings and still disagree. That does not mean they didn‚Äôt read it- just that they have enough mental capacity to know your opinion is trash.
---
Flashlights destroy Hag traps, and this is not easily countered by moving your mouse.
---
In this particular situation I don't think she did because she tunneled him instead of hitting me.  She probably spotted his idiocy from across the map.
---
So I was playing on my friends account yesterday since she's on vacation but didn't want to miss out on the double bloodpoints and I'm maxed on almost everything or have everything I already want on my killers and survivors. I took her from rank 19 to rank 9. During that whole time playing my most used killer on her account, every single person I encountered wasted the God pallet and fucked the whole loop up for themselves. Sometimes even going through the shed and dropping the pallet before I was even half way into the shed. I just stood there and shook my head in shame. Or they would just DC the second they got outplayed. Which is extremely sad because I haven't really been able to play this game much in the past 2 months. In 2 months time I've played this game, or any for that matter, for maybe a total of 3 hours. I'm fully convinced that the great majority of people that play this on ps4 were grown in a vegetable garden. Just complete and total potatoes. 
---
I did come across 1 really good swf team last night. They thought they were going to bully and pick on a rank 1 pig while not knowing I was using my friends account. They all DC'd 1 by 1 when they got shit on though. 3 of the 4 were using MoM and 2 of them rage quit before even 1 gen got done. Ya know, typical douchebags. MoM, triple flashlights, not doing gens, just trying to pick on newer killers or those that are less skilled.
---
Apparently he didn‚Äôt want to spoil the Scream Movie
---
But if they end up getting 3 or 4 kills aren't they don't their job? Their goal is to kill the survivors shouldn't the survivors have to adapt?
---
If I got 4 stacks of bbq, had a decent game and the player was entertaining, sure. 
---
If I‚Äôm looking for Solid Snake Claudette, best believe I‚Äôm getting that hook.
---
I agree, most Ruin killers are garbage and can be looped to oblivion.
---
On the other hand: those bad with skill checks can either look for the totem or gen tap.
---
Also simply letting go if you miss a ruin check is a good idea as there are 2 seconds with no progress and skill checks can still appear. Solo gens are the most efficient ones with ruin around (when not tapping).
---
I do something like this also but instead of letting them escape I close the hatch in their face and let them bleed while I nod aggressively.

Whatever button you use to activate other killers abilities I‚Äôm guessing
---
I got my meg, kate, feng, claud and dwight with all perks. Very noice if you enjoy playing perkroulette. Its worth to have all the perks on a survivor so you can try many cool perk builds.
---
My fav perk build is the worst build ever: use object of obsession and no mither for the ultimate killer trigger lol
---
L2
---
Ghost Face is pretty good. His perks? No.  
---
I'm All Ears - With the change, it's just a pointless chase perk. If you have a general idea of how a survivor will play, it's pretty much pointless. Good for learning mindgames, not for much else. Overall, I don't think anybody cares if this is nerfed or buffed.  
---
Thrilling Tremors - Meh tracking/stalling perk. The cool-down is too long to be actively useful. Needs a buff to that like asap if it will ever be used.  
---
Furtive Chase - Another pointless chase perk. Maybe decreasing out of chase terror radius would be good, but the only reason I see this being used is the obsession changing aspect. That's the only fix I can see.
---
Yeah but guess what decicted servers still get lag switchers occasionally. And on that note I'm ignoring you from here on cause you're just another dumbass not worth my time since apparently you live in a fantasy land where people don't kill themselves on the hook then usually message killers telling where you are or even help the killer by leading them to you. Or purposely mess up generators
---
So like the hag and her trap? In guessing so I'm not sure though sorry dude
---
About Plague : spam with her effectiveness and Apple add-ons or hope that survivors will cleanse, if they don't cleanse, you will pretty much play a M1 killer. Stall, anti loop and tracking perks are very good on Plague. Never use anti healing perks with her.
---
Two wrongs dont make it right, but giving someone what they deserve is better than doing nothing.
---
Multiple times
---
Go read my post before commenting like it clearly says at the bottom. ü§¶
---
Is it a repost if i didnt take it from reddit tho
---
I don‚Äôt play ps4 took a guess; try all the buttons maybe
---
so basically the april fools' event for rainbow six siege? i love it
---
If killer indicates they wanna farm, I'm gonna take the free points.  But yes, it is horribly boring.
---
I agree with gooptastic. Especially on plagues lunge, it‚Äôs really satisfying. When the survivor turns the corner and think I can‚Äôt get them, but her reach is really good with the lunge. Of course then I play survivor and hate when it happens to me lol.
---
"For the team"
---
‚ÄúAh should have just said so.‚Äù 
---
-The answer everyone wants to hear and see it happen.
---
It happens occasionally but not that often. And you cant lag switch on dedicated without litterally getting into the servers dumbass. Clearly you dont know how game design or balancing works or understand the fact that you dont have enough skill to survive in the ranks that you're at.
---
_are you sure about that_
---
When there's one left I've been slugging them and then opening the exit gates. Its up to you to survive before EGC gets you, go for the gates or try to find the hatch? 
---
Make your choice.
---
This ^ 
---
Someone also P3‚Äôd every one of their survivors (maybe killers too), made spreadsheets and graphs, and the results showed no increase in chances of more rare items.
---
When the rank 20 meg comes on the generator you're doing when it's almost finished, fucks up a skillcheck and then the killer goes after you
---
Thank you. I do this as well when I play killer.
---
 
---
I think killers who continue to go full tryhard with 5 gens and 2 survivors are sadists.
---
I wanted to do that too but i dont know how to cut out stuff correctly on the phone lol
---
If you were good at looping around the path they were running or chasing them into a tight space it wasn't so much of an issue. Now did suck on mostly open maps but could still be done in certain areas
---
I don't know what you on about. The bright colors are supposed to warn killers that the survivor is poisonous or venomous (toxic). It adds to the atmosphere. 
---
Joking aside, there are a few 'funny'/'meme' skins like Candle Wraith, Salad Hag. Neither of those ruin the atmosphere, imo. Then again, the only time this game has any atmosphere is when you are playing against scratched mirror or tombstone Myers.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è not a single lie was told 
---
‚ÄúStOp CaMpIng Me‚Äù while all 3 survivors are trying to circle the hook lmao
---
Even for a surv main like me, this is satisfying to watch. Toxic player get owned.
---
actually negative multiplied by negative get positive so checkmate nasa
---
OP here I deleted the post since most of you arguing in the comments were too dumb to read it anyway apparently. To the few people who were smart enough to. Nice chatting with you and some of you had interesting view points. But sorry after all the toxic idiots on this thread I don't feel like chatting anymore so sorry for no more replies. But have a good day
---
OOOOOOOOOOH!! Can I get an F? üòÇ
---
A-Are you serious?
---
This is by far one of the worst arguments I've ever heard regarding Dead by Daylight, almost as bad as the Bloodpoint Economy.
---
Literally *anything* can make a survivor disconnect, so are you suggesting that all killers just stop doing the thing in their name, and killing survivors? That's actually ludicrous.
---
Maybe start at 6? Then go 8 then 10? Corrput purge is a not-so-great power, agreed. It's because people don't cleanse. Well, if you're above Rank 15 that is.
---
I don't really think he's OP but with all the talk im really worried they'll nerf him and ruin his power again, I think it's better to keep him the same.
---
That‚Äôs why you have to for e the stun which is easy and comes with almost no drawback when running Enduring as I said. 
---
No one calls you dumb but from what I read I can tell you lack experience.
---
Had 3 games last night where I both found and got rid of ruin, killer found me and tunnelled me shortly after. It‚Äôs like getting rid of ruin gives them reason to camp.
---
Everybody toxic, until the killer starts mori-ing survivors. Excellent gameplay dude.
---
I would love to see your data backing up this 96% of killers lag switching claim.  I've had *maybe* three matches out of hundreds where I even remotely suspected there might be a lag switch.  Maybe your connection is just poor.
---
Camping is shitty but it's just what shitty killers do and the best you can do is learn to extend chases so your team can do gens or do gens yourself if someone else is being camped.  Make the killer regret their shitty decision.
---
NOED is a crutch perk, but can be completely removed by competent survivors, and good killers won't typically waste a slot on it unless they're doing an intentionally toxic build.
---
Ruin can also be completely removed and/or played around by competent survivors.
---
I know it might feel like these perks make killers godlike if you aren't that great at the game, but here's what you do:
---
Play killer.  Run Ruin. Run NOED.  Come back here when you're rank 1 and tell us how "easy" it was.
---
When was this game. I think the Spirit is me :(
---
Why are u becoming insulting?
---
I just asked u a normal question
---
Had a game yesterday as Hag.... Survivors completed 0 Gens... I had 11 hooks maxed out nearly every category.  Only failed to get the 12th and final hook because I downed too far from a usable hook, and the last survivor outplayed me to get a door open.
---
Post Game I message the one who got away "GG, Well Played"
---
I get back.. "GG ez"
---
&gt;Well I would say 100% fair considering you are playing dead by daylight. In any other game this is not 100% fair at all. After 1000+ hours I know that when I play as survivor I have to act like if I have a ball around me with his center on my body and a radius of 1,5 meters full of hitboxes so I'm not surprised when I see a hit like that, but for a new player (maybe that usually play fps) that's not really fair.
---
Most (if not all) online games where you have ping involved, this happens. 
---
Rainbow Six is an example from the top of my head. If you have a somewhat high ping, you will get shot even if you took cover a split second before. Even in Rocket League you will miss the ball because of Ping.
---
I changed it from Stealin‚Äô Steve to Filchin‚Äô Frank, along with Crimes Kenneth, so that they match the killers names in the lore like Murderin Mike did. Filch is another word for steal. I had also considered Filchy or Filthy.
---
Yikes
---
I knew about the madness tier(You can go from T3 to T2, but never from T2 to any other tier) - I just haven't ever really noticed it deplete. Could be because as soon as he hooks someone, he's straight back into shock therapy 90% of the time, running distressing and it's a small map. I rarely face him, and playing him doesn't give me this kind of information
---
if you think MoM is balanced as is...i don't even have words for you....you get rewarded for losing..sounds like a good perk to me.
---
tomorrow
---
Shopsmart! Shop-s-mart
---
If they don't the Hag is still coming back while everyone is crouching away and they're dead anyway.
---
I love the Hag, but traps under/around the hook are the lamest thing in this game.
---
This is the same guy who complains that reworked legion is broken in every match that you play.
---
Lol, force the stun? You mean by following them around 4 or 5 times. I was just making a joke and you're going all "I have 14k hours and you sound like a noob" on me. Chill dude.
---
for me its a really stupid question (nothing personal) but u get a anti camper perk with a 5! seconds stun. Its really strong now thats all.
---
As long as we are doing our objectives then we are playing properly. I'm not going to just run to the killer with open arms lol. I think they just want us all to start the match already on the hook. Haha.
---
Well that‚Äôs tragic!
---
I wish I didn't waste my 4 BPS on Trapper and have *nobody* else run ANY BPS, EVER.
---
r  E E E E
---
Sounds like NOED. Not a survivor main, I hate old DS and current MoM. Just saying these 3 perks all should have been removed/changed.
---
1,4k. You aren‚Äôt even reading correctly, why are you even here? 
---
I commented on your bs to help but you seem absolutely ignorant on the subject matter, keep on crying I‚Äôm done here.
---
i ran cakes and pudding because i used up all of my Bloody Party Streamers. That's probably what everyone else did.
---
This is being indirectly buffed tomorrow with Enduring's rework. MoM shouldn't even have existed to begin with.
---
Bring a Styptic to every match and you have pretty much the same result, except, you are limited to how many add-ons you got.
---
Even survivors have said mettle of man is absurdly broken. Survivor mains to be exact. That's telling of how strong it is, and that it warranted a nerf. People who play both sides have also thought DS was too strong, especially at higher ranks. It has been a vocal majority on either sides that the perks are too strong, and the only people that thought DS getting nerfed was bad, were the people who absolutely didn't need it. 
---
I think both sides have broken stuff, but survivors have been the powerside against anything not the absolutely most broken stuff, and they will completely stomp weaker killers. It's an inherent issue on both sides in that rather than completely remaking the game to suit all playstyles better, there's a huge gap between each side, and they are nerfing based on what weaker killers can accomplish, making already strong killers much stronger. 4 MoM's guarantees everyone escapes against any M1 killer, pretty much
---
I wouldn't say guaranteed, because a lot of the time the survivor get slugged or ure Midchase and have to decide between letting yourself go down to use ur perk or just run the killer around but maybe get downed just the second after ur ds ran out. Yeah ds was to string before but I think they nerfed it a bit to much. And of course MoM needed change but only protection hits is most of the time just RNG if it counts as and protection hit or not
---
Why would they not go for the person that is injured and an easy target? Don't be mad because you're getting killed
---
That feeling when your build has 4 "second chance perks" and you never get the chance to use any of them :p
---
I tried to offer to farm last night, as the trapper on Haddonfield. But when I gave the signal, Nea shook her head no. 
---
168,000 points later, they were all dead.
---
Problem is I've also seen(And encounted) a situation where a fully healthy survivor is running around after I've chased someone else and downed them, then proceed to down this survivor only to be DS'ed. You are essentially being punished for downing too fast. Tunneling BTW
---
You ruin my game i ruin your's..... Pun intended.
---
Looks nice
---

---
Looks like you just time-skipped past him just before the saw hit you.  
---
***KINGU KURIMUZON!***
---
As I said in another comment I dont think mom is balanced now, but is the new version fair? Protection hits almost never count as a stack on wglf so why would it count for MoM?
---
Yes, but why do they go "Noob cruch perker kys"?
---
Just here to point out that Urban Evasion works only against bad-average Hags. Against one focused on chases and who doesn't trap hooks it won't do shit.
---
Not at all. If you get stunned by the pallet you drop the survivor. Doesn't matter which way you are facing.
---
It‚Äôs is boring but during double BP you can get like 100k from one match bruh
---
survivors who burn party streamers
---
But end up the first to die 
---
LOLOLOLOL
---
Nope I am not üòÇ
---
Eh you aren't really suppose to report it,  which is weird but whatever. It won't matter until they punish people who DC. Which I agree with to a certain extent. A lot of surviviors DC over being face camped,  and I don't blame them. It's annoying to just hang out on the hook all game. I think if they want to keep nerfing perks, then they should add in something to prevent camping,  like no hook progression if the killer is within so many meters from the hook. With bbq and everything killers have NO reason to camp unless exit gates are powered. Imo. So people are going to be forced to depip regardless I think that's why they DC. Killers simply because they can't find anyone easily lololol.
---
Had a Prayer Beads Spirit with Rancor last night and it was terrifying. I‚Äôm so glad I wasn‚Äôt the obsession and didn‚Äôt have to use my Decisive that game since the obsession got mori‚Äôd at the exit gate as it was opening.
---
I don't think it was me then. Rip other spirit
---
In about an hour and a half. He's being released after the Bloodhunt
---
Just downvote and move on.
---
I'd assume Ghostface's cosmetics would be like Ash, where they dropped alongside him, but since we've never had licensed cosmetics before Ash, I don't really have a leg to stand on when I say I'd bet on Piggi's dropping later.
---
yea i don't want to deal with the crouching shit what did you think XD
---
That was tunneling? Wow the definition sure has changed a lot, so what about spirit abandoning chase to go to the gen and being followed by laury? Thats spirit tunneling? Or was the tunneling when they followed them after hitting them and hitting them a second time when they choked at the pallet?
---
As a killer who uses streamers it‚Äôs really disheartening when survivors dc
---
I don't care about this that much. But different hair colours are different to a killer wearing a face that is completely ridiculous and  blazed. i.e. against the theme of  'killers'.
---
You're right and you're wrong, but you're wrong and right. Right to be wrong, but wrong to be right. Rightfully wrong, but wrongfully Right. Right. Wrong. Fuck.
---
Tommorow
---
Ah, ok, wasn't aware.
---
Pig can teabag
---
I stopped playing due to never being able to find any matches
---
I suggest taking a look at this sub's rules before making more posts like this.
---
the real question is how to convince the last guy not to struggle?
---
I don't have much skills so I would pick sprit as one, and most likely the pig, I forgot that Myers has obsession skills which isn't in my likeing, what kind of play styles is legion
---
Fair? Sure.  Fun? No.  
---
And I mean it's not fun for either party.  Staring at someone on a hook for two minutes is possibly the most boring thing I could think to do as a killer.  
---
Though "camping" and "patrolling" have become far too intertwined in this community.  If I see scratch marks or a Claudette dip behind a jungle gym... I'm going to patrol and if I don't find her I'll leave.  I'm not going to ignore it and run to the opposite side of the map just to keep some crybaby from calling me a camper in post game chat.
---
Can't wait to see lagging killer =)
---
Get Leatherface for BBQ if you missed it in the shrine, it cuts down on the grind a lot and the aura reading ain't half bad
---
Her traps will never not make me jump. Always gets me. I didnt try crouching yet when someone is hooked since i just didnt know, but will try whenever i play against a Hag again.
---
Imagine being this toxic and *this* bad
---
Because rumor &gt; official release date.
---
We can spot campers based on their movement.
---
if you still decide to cleans, use a fountain far from a strategic spot.
---
 At least it will make her lost some time to reach it and come back.
---
no going after her after being farmed.... dick move
---
They're saying you can't buy the black cloak that skemooo did, you're saying you could, but you can't.
---
people would just kill themselves
---
i'm personally a fan of the look he has now, has a medieval theater kinda look to it imo
---
It might sound like a derpy question but why is the shack pallet classed as the god pallet? Is it something to do with looping in that area or stunning the killer to drop survivors etc?
---
Focusing specifically on the Tokyo subway, construction began in 1927. There is still a possibility of it being before 2000.
---
Yep. Usually do wraith if I'm killer but wanted to give hillbilly a try and was on the swamp map, which I'm terrible at, well I hook a few people but they all keep getting down. Go to one door and 3 are waiting and teabag and run out. The other easily could leave but no they wait at the other door and tea bag and leave when I come up.
---
What does spirit do exactly, the spirit is the one killer I don't know what she does at all
---
Based. I do it for the big dick energy as wraith.
---
obviously the lower the survivors rank the stronger the Killer, but thats the same for every Killer, so Im a Bit confused by this question
---
He's mid tier killer so rank 13 to 9 ish he's fine and maybe to rank 6 is before people he starts lacking.
---
not cleansing is not abut avoiding being hooked, it's just to not allow her to down you in 6s.
---
Since she does not have map pressure, making her chase you for 20-30s is enough to win the game as survivors, it's the same against the clown who is super good at downing quickly. Don't specially try to evade him, just make the chase as long as possible, 20-30s is enough.
---
The general idea behind Legion is to start injuring as many people as you can early on then cleaning up afterward.  His power gives him a significant speed boost and when you stab someone you can see the heart beat of other survivors in your terror radius.  But it won't put people from an injured to dying state, you still have to M1 for that.
---
And I would still highly recommend Leatherface for BBQ and Chili.  At tier 3 it will double your bloodpoints, allowing you to level up your other killers twice as fast.
---
that comma is wildly unnecessary
---
Yeah I'd say so too
---
I don't mind letting survivors get some points but yeah farming is mad boring.
---
What does she do
---
But why not just go do gens and force the killer to patrol them? If after being hooked and walking away and 15 second later they're getting unhooked why not stay somewhat close and patrol near the hook?
---

Usually because some perks are seen as stronger than other's in many ways. 
---
Take a look at NOED for example: NOED is a perk that gives the Killer one final attempt at getting a kill, by giving them the power to insta-down Survivors. It's seen as a crutch perk for the reason that it can make any person go from a 0K to a 4K if they're lucky with it. It makes all the work the Survivors put into escaping up until that point feel meaningless.
---
Look at Mettle of Man or the old Decisive Strike for the same reason: You spend all this time chasing someone, and finally you're about to be able to hook them to get back to what you were initially doing... and then the Survivor more or less says "lol nope" and the chase re-ensues. 
---
This usually isn't much of a problem against bad Survivors, but imagine a guy who is a master of looping and knows how to get into your head perfectly every time. Imagine taking the whole game trying to catch this one guy only for it to be stolen from you at the last possible moment and have to start from the beginning all over again.
---
A Killer needs to know how to pick their battles, because otherwise they'll fall into that same trap of "chase one guy for 3 gens straight and then he uses Mettle of Man".
---
When a perk is called a "crutch perk" it's usually because that perk was designed specifically to be used at the last possible moment to screw the other player over. Adrenaline, old D-Strike, Mettle of Man, NOED, Blood Warden, and even Haunted Grounds have all been called "crutches" an insurmountable amount of times, even if sometimes they make no sense to be called "crutches".
---
The way I see it, just use what you like and what you are comfortable with. People will always complain no matter what you do, so why try to please the crowd? As long as you don't partake in toxic behaviours such as telling someone to end their life because they use a certain item in a videogame, you can do anything you like. That's my philosophy.
---
Jake in his tracksuit is just fast AF boiii
---
Be me, be survivor, tea-bag to try and get killers attention and throw him off his game via anger, GetStunnedFargit.txt, camp tractor, killer leaves, nvm I didn‚Äôt take into account that I‚Äôm the only retard in this place, completely fuck up because am shit, friend tries to pallet stun, friend is too retard and wastes the pallet, has to save my useless ass from hook and put self in danger, in return I squander my life to tea-bag, IAmAFuckingDrainOnMyTeam.eeeeee, try to waste more of teams time by getting hooked, killer has a mori, takes me out back and stabs me like the useless trash I am.
---
Why killers hate it? Survivors giving free hits to you.
---
It is a consistently extremely ‚Äúsafe‚Äù pallet. As in the killer is forced to break it, or it becomes an infinite. 
---
Most other pallets can to some success be ignored and either chase down the survivor with bloodlust or mindgame them. This one you cannot (unless the survivor reaaaally messes up).
---
thety didnt want to get camped
---
you still get "fuck" by flashlights ?
---
r/terriblefacebookmemes
---
I had a survivor complain I used Franklins because I saw they all had meds and toolboxes on the load screen. Their postgame argument was that they bought those items with their hard earned bp and I was being a big meanie. My favorite delusion yet.
---
Not just PS4. Been doing killer a bit more lately and I've run into this on Xbox as well.
---
Urban generally lends people to a dead weight playstyle where they just crouch over the map all game, much like self care does the same, where most who run it use it instead of doing constructive things or the objective.
---
I'd rather not run a perk that's largely useless except against 1 killer (and maybe 1/100 times in a chase against Huntress).
---
Just tank it with enduring as killer. It‚Äôs often close to the basement so you can get a cheap kill if someone stays at the shack
---
you want the killer bring Franklin's demise. 
---
It's one perk slot dedicated for nothing specially if you bring an item just to bait that.
---
Low quality bait
---
I don't know much about Plague since I both don't own and hate her, buuuttttt I have a few pointers for The Legion.
---
(Taken from TrU3Ta1ent) Hit survivors with Feral Frenzy and use the Killer Instinct (red icon over survivors with heartbeat sound) to find other survivors and inflict them with Deep Wound, it's effective to slowing the game down, stack it with Sloppy Butcher and Thanatophobia and you've got yourself a decent slowing-the-game-down-without-Ruin build.
---
Another good build for Legion is Spirit Fury and Enduring with the Iridescent Button, vault pallets in Frenzy and you break the pallet, and it stacks towards Spirit Fury.
---
Now I'm no expert on Plague, but running Thanatophobia and breaking all survivors via the vomit is a VERY effective strategy, since survivors (in most cases) don't cleanse against Plague.
---
Hope these help.
---
Tried to do this Saturday PS4 and got tired of people who turned off messages (can‚Äôt say I blame them), and some people who can‚Äôt take the hint in-game (flashlight spam and teabag).
---
So the killer isn't supposed to punish bad moves by the survivors and instead just let them get away. ü§î
---
Farmed or Not; A killer should be punishing any stupid moves a survivor team makes. The entire term "Tunneling" and the negative use of it I've always found to be super silly. If you're going after someone so hard it's actually costing you the game that's one thing and a poor play but if you do it and it puts you at the advantage as seen in this video here that's just playing smart.
---
1 If the other guy is hooked the first 5 minutes he's probably deppipping, the killer will probably dark pip even if he doesn't find any other survivor or he's able to hook another one. 
---
2 The survivor also has to wait 2 minutes while he's getting facecamped and one generator takes about 80 seconds without toolboxes. 5 generators will take 400 seconds if a single survivor works on each generator, it will still be 6.5 minutes (3 complete hooks and a half).
---
3 If you camp someone who was just playing normally and not being toxic you are just bad.
---
4 Not all survivors are SWF
---
No they're not lol thats how the game was designed
---
what the literal fuck are you talking about anymore
---
Spirit can phase-walk, which is basically her running extremely fast while also not being able to see her. You can‚Äôt see survivors but can see their scratch marks. Which makes it perfect for yanking people off gens or chests. However you can still hear her but there are add ons that change that.
---
i'm always DC because i don't want give the hatch to killer and because i'm toxic on both sides =D
---
When she uses her power, she turns invisible and leaves her physical body. While Surviviors can't see where actually is, she also can't see where they are. 
---
But Surviviors also cannot tell when ur phasing and when ur just holding still. So if you hold still at a pallet drop they might just be dumb Enough to slow vault into you.
---
I would have liked the classic ghostface aswell, but I'm pretty sure the reason the made it that way was to make it their own. By adding something that had nothing to do with the scream film and just an outfit design made by them
---
I find it silly to be upset by a teabag.... and yet... here we are
---
It seems like everyone wants to play killer for the event so times have been crazy.
---
I've been out of the game since Pig. What did they do to DS?
---
I‚Äôve played over 1700 hours. Trust me I‚Äôve taken the long way. The game is enjoyable and not just about the points but during the 2x BP weekends, it does become about the points for me.  It takes so long to level up characters get get certain perks in this game. A little farming here and there isn‚Äôt a big deal. 
---
And you can get 100K+ depending on if you have BBQ/WGLF and if other survivors burn BP offerings.
---
Lol obivously. I think you misread what I typed.
---
BMing is just fine if it's eliciting a certain behavior that will win you/everyone else the game. If I'm getting tunneled down or chased for 5minutes I'm definitely going to teabag and keep the killer on me while my team rushes gens. I'll make sure that I get the killer salty enough to facecamp me. 
---
I may lose, but I'll buy my team enough time to get all the gens done and run out.
---
Baby Laurie thought she was gonna get her DS off :( boohoo
---
There‚Äôs always that one jake to ruin it...
---
Hag is more popular than Trapper because she doesn't have to waste time hunting her own traps down, and they can't be permanently sabotaged.
---
i'm toxic i don't want share with other
---
Situationally it can be, just not in many situations, and most who run it are really bad at the game, don't contribute, and don't know what to actually do in chases.
---
Yep, gotta love it. Survivor induced camping is real.
---
Fuck me then
---
old Legion was obviously the most annoying killer ever in game by far, but he's tolerable now.
---
Stop it, i can only get so erect.
---
Lmaooo remind you of any NOED like perks that we have?
---
Yes? I'm a survivor main that takes long breaks from the game. Purple ranks at best. Let me be shit.
---
Huntress did this to the last survivor, but then they carried them to the exit gate.
---
ngl your controller movements look spot-on like mouse movements im proud of you
---
nice vid too-
---
Hmm, solid advice. I'll definitely not get called a camper then. Maybe get some GG EZ or Baby Killer stuff, but at least I won't be the dreaded camper.....
---
im pretty sure thats blurring out the name
---
I see, thanks :)
---
Yea I‚Äôm playing as killer. Makes sense. Definitely the longest I‚Äôve waited in any of the other Double BP events.
---
I can't get either a survivor or killer lobby right now. Lol.
---
It was a fucking joke dude, break the pallet is what dumb survivors used to say, I even used alternating caps. As far as 14k it was an accident that I kept repeating, I meant 1.4k.
---
For 'SURVIVORS' is the keyword. Not killer.
---
If you was gonna camp you got DC'd on
---
No, because its just text on my screen, but ill take your word for it.
---
Candle Wraith is by no means funny. It's odd but menacing in it's own way. The mask OP presented is none of that. The green hag is not funny either, if you were just to use her hair then I agree, but include the entire outfit and it's not. Definitely not the level of this mockery.
---
Like Candle Wraith isn't silly.
---
Clown
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/43561/trapper-is-still-garbage/
---
They can't be permanently saboed anymore FYI.
---
Back in the day bloodpoints = progress towards pipping.
---
I guess they could revisit the cap.
---
Agreed
---
Currently on break at work and no doubt that it'll be NSFW content so I'll just ask here. What's ugly bastard?
---
I remember that. But even then, a cap wasn‚Äôt necessary.
---
I think we found the teabagger guys
---
Children in this subreddit and casuals fortnite players dont understand that logic hence the downvotes. They would clownify every game if they only could.
---
I mean they do have candle wraith and Santa clown and a couple others
---
thats the thing i cannot find people to play with on the LFG reddit because its them that keep deleting me, blocking me, being rude, ignoring my messages and declining my invites
---
Omfg I feel this on a spiritual fucking level
---
No, but I 100% teabag all the time
---
When unhooked decisive becomes active for 40/50/60 seconds. If picked up by the killer while the timer is active succeed the skill check to instantly escape and stun the killer for 5 seconds. 
---
This is a one time use. Succeeding or failing the skill check disables the perk. Succeeding turns you into the obsession
---
RIN NO :(
---
Because the killer knows he's single handedly ruining the game for that one person. 90% of the campers are just trolls that have fun by being a dick.
---
GoTtA sEcUrE tHe KiLl
---
I'm so confused. How do you get max Boldness, but not a single point in any other category?
---
Collecting salt in post game chat, reported threats or threads like this is always a good incentive. Camping to depip is also a thing. Sometimes I am just too bored to play the Merry Go-Round game or look for immersed survivors and I decide to apply the fishing strategy, see how many survivors take the bait trying to rescue their friend.
---
How it feels going against a 115% speed killer with bloodlust 3
---
Lmao how is decisive without counterplay? It's designed for you to not tunnel. If you don't like the perk you can, oh idk, *NOT* tunnel the guy that just got off the hook. Or if you really wanna be that guy, just slug them and then camp the slug while you wait out the DS timer. 
---
There's more counterplay to DS as of right now than there should be so thank God Enduring is getting nerfed in that regard
---
The dc is the cherry on top, what a dumbass lol
---
I've played over 2000 hours. Trust me, I've taken the long way. The game is enjoyable, and not just about the points, but during 2x BP weekends, it does become about the points for me. But i will not go out of my way to suck the fun out of this game. It takes so long to level up characters and to get certain perks in this game, but i came back to this game after a week ir two on Saturday, played about 7 matches and on Sunday i played about 3 and soon enough, i had 1 000 000 blood points. No farming done. I wasn't shallow, i was fair. Maybe you deserve a break from DBD like me. Try playing other games and when you come back, it will be fresh. This is just a recommendation.
---
&gt;And you can get 100K+ depending on if you have BBQ/WGLF and/or if other survivors burn BP offerings.
---
Yes, but you didn't mention any perks ir offerings. I also achieved 100k with these perks/offerings with no farming to be done.
---
I'm sorry I really don't know what ,you are trying to say here. You are in disagreement with me but I have no clue what about. My comment was about pricks playing like the one in the example and then you start talking about second chances which won't save your ass in this case.
---
You should‚Äôve been fucking downed
---
What exactly is the enduring rework? I haven't heard much about it
---
Soemtimes game data doesn‚Äôt save so your progress gets reverted. It‚Äôs happened to some of my friends and me once thought.
---
Which couple others. How is the Santa Clown 'funny'? Yeah, invite that santa Clown to the kids party and let's see how many are going to laugh at a fucked up looking clown dressed as something resembling a santa with worms coming out of his belly. Now put thos mockery into the children's party and they'll scream NEW FORTNITE SKIN PLOX PLOX
---
115% speed killer with 3 Play With Your Food tokens AND bloodlust 3
---
necrophilia at it's finest
---
what does this have to do with anything???????????
---
I never understood people who deign to unhook you right in front of the killer. That's just asking for you to get tunnelled and if you don't have decisive it really sucks to deal with
---
You realize Survivors get extra bloodpoints and points towards their emblems for doing that right?
---
It is very reasonable to DC because Killers are toxic, you can find many forums of Killers justifying toxic things like tunneling, camping, smurfing, abusing exploits etc.
---
Camping to get survivor bait is a good smart tactic sitting directly under me just looking at me is dumb as fuck.
---
Happened to me recently. Was playing as Pig and I barely even left the hook area before the Survivors were already unhooking the hooked person. Obviously they complained about me on the post-game chat.
---
How would it not break the game's economy? If there was no max in a match it would be eternal farming sessions, especially in bloodhunts, which would completely break the bloodpoint economy.
---
Oh shit. If you also have bbq and chili that basically let's you find everyone. That does sound pretty good.
---
Bless you child. Salvation will come.
---
I love playing against her because literally all you have to do is disabled her traps and she becomes D tier and then it's free loops for days
---
No you don't understand the question. For example, Nurse is generally bad at low ranks since low rank killers are very bad with the nurse. At the opposite, Doctor is great at low ranks since he compensate for newbs's inability to find survivors, but he is lackluster at highest ranks.
---
When a ugly person typically a guy fucks girls while also being a bastard about it. Like some are fat greasy nerds with huge dicks who mind control bitches. Some are just really ugly guys who rape girls.
---
Fortnite bad minecraft good
---
I own all killers and still get splinters :/
---
Really? That‚Äôs so weird to me if they have no reason to do so.  I do know the majority of players are over 18 and will not play with anyone under 18. That‚Äôs usually the biggest reason I see if any.  Most people don‚Äôt mind playing with new players.
---
We're talking about what makes survs DC.
---
And i can pick his perks
---
Hold up is the hag actually nude i mean its just rotten flesh or dafuq is her skin?
---
It's a way of telling someone that they don't get to play bc you didn't like what they did
---
Oh okay, good to know. I‚Äôve tried many times and failed so I probably won‚Äôt be going full Sabo anytime soon but this is the first time it actually worked for me lol. Thanks for the replies!
---
Ah okay got it. No t-bags, I was just so surprised it finally worked that I got the hell out of there lol.
---
Sounds... weird but it would make sense for Clown to be into it since he's a genuinely ugly bastard in general. I was expecting something more shocking like mutilation porn lol
---
Many people have fun by anoying others, they prob want the hate
---
I also like Phimosis and Smegma
---
Ah, thank you for that intel. Only recently started playing again.
---
worse part, this is a depip lol didn't get a chance to touch a gen huh?
---
I'm scared this exists. The entity is most displeased
---
Slow teabag to let it SINK IN! Get it? Teabag.... sink in.... no? Ok
---
ZA WARUDO, TOKI WO TOMARE!!!
---
That‚Äôs kinda cool lmao
---
I don‚Äôt camp when i‚Äôm the killer and I don‚Äôt care for it but I never complain about it. It‚Äôs a weak tactic and the higher you go in rank the less people fall for it. They straight up will leave you to die instead of deal with a camper. Or you have perks like borrowed time that are a fuck you to campers.  If someone wants to waste time instead of going around for points that‚Äôs on them.
---
It *is* tunneling if you down and hook the person who just got unhooked though.
---
You do realize the amount GF has to stalk is drastically shorter than the Shape‚Äôs
---
So do survivors. Who also do it more so. At least with Ghostface's release, BHVR is finally leveling the playing field.
---
*PTSD at teabagging survviors intensifies. *
---
I have a whiffing problem when I play Spirit, but I'm not sure why. I hit most of the swings I make with any other killer, but with Spirit I miss about half of them. I play a gen-grab build mostly, so I do okay, but it's still frustrating.
---
Yes good.

Poor sportsmanship.

Its always the Lauries with object of obsession that DC once they are downed

Why no P3 level 50Pig? You displease me.

You get the best and the worst of people during the events. Unfortunately it means the camping and tunneling usually increase.

I don't have to explain shit to a toxic killer
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
Jake: I've skipped time and lept past it!
---
Only if the killer is scummy... I'd be more upset with the teammate
---
pig &gt; any other killer
---
any contradicting opinion is wrong
---
Update: she killed one of my friends let the other get the bear trap off and escape we messaged her after and said she was cool and added her
---
It does exist but not in the way that some people make it out to be. Gen rush isn't a fault of the survivors, it's a fault of the game design and a little bit of the killer's depending on the situation. If survivors can coordinate to get gens done in an efficient and timely manner, that's gen rushing. It doesn't mean that the survivors did anything wrong as some people like to imply, it just means they managed to work quickly either because the killer wasn't skilled enough to apply pressure on the survivors or the game design made it impossible to apply pressure
---
Add dying light and a mori if you want to win by all disconnects.
---
I DC when I'm not having fun at all.
---
i'm a survivor main lmao???
---
where did you get toxic killer from, hm? you know legitimately fucking nothing about me, don't fucking make assumptions
---
the main problem is solo survivors .
---
if you have SWF it's easy to communicate. 
---
or you need to have 3 perk slots only to use Kindred and have some kind of communication.
---
I am unsure why the Killers are DCing, normally I see DCs relative to the map being played, for example, I barely see killers play Haddonfield or Badham Preschool (Which tbh I do not blame them). If a Killer is gen rushed, I normally see a DC there too, but barely at the start of the game.
---
Survivors... Lol I could go on how or why they DC; being downed first, being hit through a pallet, being hit through a window, OoO who teabags and is downed right after, I could go on.
---
New to dead by daylight and I never knew this was considered toxic tbh I just thought it was like me communicating to the killer in some sort of way
---
I was typing as fast as i could and i didn't notice my mistake i am sorry if there are more mistakes in the title
---
Farm him out to get BBQ and his other perks on other killers
---
Is it really? Half the time the person who unhooked the survivor literally body blocks me to get hit, Why would i do exactly what they want? Lol If all of them scatter I chase the closest one but if i get the type who surrounds the one player it‚Äôs better to chase him/her as everyone else take turns getting hit.
---
You talk as if this game scares anyone besides new players and over dramatic streamers.
---
&gt;What exactly is the enduring rework? I haven't heard much about it
---
You can find the info on PTBs / 3.0.0 patch notes.
---
best answer. I think someone blew it too early but I was facing away which lead to the assumption.
---
You're saying it like it is something bad. Unhooked surv is 1 hit away from being eliminated from the match entirely. Why should I NOT chase him, ignoring dumbasses with full health who unhooked him 2 steps away from me?
---
Huntress: MMMM YOU LIKE?
---
Tapp: Uhhh fuck
---
So killers DC because of the games fault but survivors DC because they are salty. ok.
---
I mean yes, going for someone who just got unhooked right in front of you is the most unambiguous example of tunneling.
---
That toxic issue is a direct result of poor balancing and BHVR creating gameplay mechanics that suck ass. I play games to have fun. If I'm not having fun I'm not wasting my time by being someone else's entertainment when I could just find a new game where I DO have fun instead. Easy peasy.
---
You got yourself a killer for free, congrats. Get his bbq teachable
---
Oh Damn, yea that's a huge timeline, the only other thing to work with is that he is a Jamacian working in Japan as a teacher. That seems more likely after the year 2000 but it could have happened in the early 80s or 90s. Hard to say.
---
This is true of many good perks. 
---
"I would have won but for self-care on survivors A,B,C."
---
"I would have won but for that clutch d-strike."
---
Any perk that can't sometimes be identified as the winning perk likely deserves a buff. (Some more subtle perks would require more detailed analysis)
---
NOED has tons of counter-play. It can be countered before it activates, after it activates, by already meta generally powerful perks (MoM, DH, etc.), by specific counter-perks (small game). and by non-perk gameplay (excellent looping, flashlight stuns, opening exit gate, etc). It also literally can't be active more than 3 minutes per game.
---
It's fine if you don't want to run it. I often do on killers who need it (clown could only murder his way out of a kid's party, even if I enjoy him), esp. as I am missing key perks on many killers still. I definitely look forward to the point where my lower rank killers have a broad enough perk base to try out interesting and powerful builds, but I'm not going to stage a political protest against a solid perk that consistently unlocks early across killers.
---
what system are you on? I have also been having issue?
---
Same. Nurse too
---
However, if you teabag after a pallet stun and get nodded at once you get downed you deserved it.
---
And the time it takes to crouch away she'll be too close regardless. It's a lose-lose situation.
---
It‚Äôs more about going for the person people are trying to protect than the specific person you unhooked.
---
This might more so be the 90‚Äôs now that I think about it - the JET program was founded in 1987 and Adam got a 90‚Äôs themed skin.
---
That's just my experience, 90% of killers I face (Red/Purple Ranks) go through with their games.
---
I've lost count at how many times I down someone first and they DC, or through a window or pallet. Personal experience of them not being able to cut it. 
---
And Btw, being gen rushed and DCing isn't a game problem, it's them being salty for being gen rushed so quick and leaving.
---
‚ÄúCheap kill‚Äù
---
Huntress: I brought champagne bottle, but it empty
---
How?
---
You can choose when you want to use it, the only limitation being that you need to be injured, which is not uncommon.
---
It can act like insurance when looping, so that if you make a mistake, dead hard will nullify it and let you get to a pallet or window.
---
Doesn't Hillbilly's default outfit show his belly?
---

most of the time I don't stay in the after game chat.  It's always people whining like crybabies

---
Well, that escalated quickly.
---
Quick question, can the wraith close hatch while invisible? And if so does he remain invisible after closing the hatch?
---
Not enough oinks to be a accurate tierlist.
---
Yup
---
you mean ***s t o n k s***
---
someone was complaining? i saw some youtube footage of new Ghostface, he doesn't seem like imbalanced killer. much easier to counter than Myers and Plague for when you're exposed/broken cause no huge lunge, no snowballing, no shit that covers your screen and prevents from clear view of Adiris.
---
I'm on PC. Which is even more suprising.
---
I would very much like there to be 110 killers in DBD one day xD!
---
This... does put a smile on my face.
---
Yea, that would be pretty damn cool!
---
That‚Äôs also tier III Myers. His lunge range is longer than normal.
---
The thing is, the game doesn't require you to actually crouch. It requires you to hold the Crouch button. So you can unhook or be unhooked, drop from heights, repair gens, heal, etc. AS LONG as you are PRESSING the button. Many ppl don't know tho.
---
"TUNNELING!!!!!!!"
---
You literally ran into me after being unhooked.
---
Lmao. Survivs be so cute.
---
I probably could I just don‚Äôt really play to hide anymore beyond a brief duck during the game. I have more fun going around and doing things.
---
My point exactly. But people are complaining. It‚Äôs a small minority, they‚Äôre being very vocal about it on Twitter. Worried the devs are going to get the wrong idea and revert the changes.
---
He looped the killer and got camped
---
One time I was playing with my friend who was new to the game, he said he saw the killer and i asked who  
---
"Wraith"  
---
So here I am walking around looking for his shimmer when suddenly I hear a scream and then lisas wrinkled old boy fly out of the ground
---
It was terrifying
---
Oh i know i just mean hiding when the killer is nearby. And hasnt seen ya
---
If they could get Jennifer Tilly and Brad Douriff to do the voices for this I would be in heaven. Hearing them do those iconic laughs in game would be spine chilling fun.
---
Yeah, but he got absolutely no chase points, pallet stuns, anything?
---
They mean it's harder for someone to survive a basement hook over a normal one.
---
I had a killer that wanted to farm and he called me stupid because I didn‚Äôt farm, but I don‚Äôt want to play like that it‚Äôs boring.
---
This sub just a giant argument
---
I read your post. You‚Äôre upset about killer perks, which can all be played around by survivors who aren‚Äôt bad, and lag switching which you seem to think happens in the majority of games - which it doesn‚Äôt. In regards to ‚ÄúOP killer perks‚Äù, get better. And in regards to the hordes of lag switchers, check your own internet because if almost every killer you face is lagging, the common denominator there is you.
---
I think those count as boldness only
---
She can take a while to set traps up and if a survivor runs anywhere away from them, the chase would take a while. Meanwhile Billy and nurse can immediately patrol to get people off gens and end chases quickly with no set up needed. 
---
She's underrated for sure and getting the trap to pop mid chase is so satisfying, but I don't think she is on nurse or Billy level.
---
Hahahahahahha!
---
Yeah, if the camera didn‚Äôt look onto here traps she‚Äôd be way less annoying. I feel like that fucks me over against her more than anything.
---
Again I don't have to explain shite to a toxic killer main
---
Oh yea I understand what you mean and even with feng and nea‚Äôs bright ass hair and clothes I can still do that pretty well surprisingly lol.
---
Looks like the poor SWF(I'd bet my bottom dollar at least that other laurie was SWF) wasn't as hot shit as he thought he was running OoO like that.
---
They probably sat in the lobby to spew vitriol when the game ended too.
---
dude this meme template is getting so fucking old
---
Yes because finding a Claudette urban evading around while wearing the matte brown outfit from the store takes skill.
---
Don't know what you're getting downvotes, I think you're right. Nothing makes me think they were good. They just got lucky being missed by a couple whiffs.
---
That they got juked on the VERY first attempt at the pallet before going down the first time and failing to drop the pallet the second time give it away.
---
You're right, but what about the hook struggle? That counts as "Survival", as does a few other things, assuming he literally only looped the killer the entire match, never touching anything else, and was one hooked.
---
Like, this seems literally impossible.
---
Aight, I'm from Europe so I don't think it's a good idea with the latency
---
Sounds like ninja wraith to me
---
As a survivor main, i completly agree. Not the killers fault you're all just idiots....
---
&gt; Skilled Huntress
---
Farm /w people unhooking.
---
&gt; Legion's feral pursuit
---
I got it in a day by farming it (the unchanged version), very easy to get.
---
&gt; Nurse's achievement
---
M&amp;A and/or Tinkerer and off you go gen grabbing.
---
Maybe a dumb question, but why were you able to see their aura right away at the beginning of the match. Nurse's Calling and BB&amp;C obviously shouldn't have applied. 
---
Whispers doesn't show you auras, does it?
---
I know what you mean. Maining a killer definitely gives you insight on how to go against them as a survivor.
---
Do you feel empathy for the hyena? Imagine yourself dying from starvation if you can imagine yourself slowly being eaten
---
Imagine getting so tilted that someone mori'd you that you rage quit lol.
---
a natural extension of my sentence would be ... on killer. I dunno I just found what he said weird.
---
Looks like rubber banding/bouncing from desync for one of you. Big reason to want dedicated servers honestly. For every time it works out like this, there is another case where you run by and are suddenly on the ground from a smack 30 ft away.
---
So you won't answer. I will infiltrate the oinkers and find out myself
---
Probably won't be like the Halloween event because all the cosmetics that are upcoming seem to be part of store collections.
---
My personal less likely theory is that they make Vials and lanterns obtainable again.
---
dropping your frames to 10 for the next 10 seconds while your camera spins in circles. 
---
i hate her so much
---
oink
---
That is basically the reason why is this game successful I believe.  Emotions are basic need for succesful product imho.
---
LMFAO YES and megs breathing sounds like amanda
---
The smart thing to do
---
&gt; I would say you got really lucky with potatoes
---
R1 potatoes then. If they were potatoes, i wouldn't know since i threw the games to focus on the achievement. Simply followed a survivor who had deep wound applied until they got close enough to another survivor or started farming with me.
---
Spark
---
snap
---
eh, i dont really care. the game is unarguably killer sided, and so is the sub. they whine about teabags and swf because they arent fun. then bitch that camping is a viable strategy as well as playing with OP killers (like Billy and Nurse) and slugging... if everyone would just play to have fun.... we could join together talking shit about the devs and how they put out half assed DLC
---
Crackle
---
You missed the point of his post entirely I think. He's not saying a killer can't close the hatch hes saying a killer refusing to kill and end the game and fucking around with the survivor is toxic.
---
Killer was a Leatherface with Insidious. Struggling would only result in getting my teammates killed while not actually doing anything for me.
---
At that point, even if I escaped I wouldn't pip so I tried to kobe and let go.
---
and the killer wasn't even near them
---
pop
---
I can tell you its a lot less than 5050
---
"Hook someone in the basement. Scratchmarks at the top of the steps"
---
Obviously this means all the survivors are on the opposite side of the map, each and every one of them.
---
Please don't hurt me
---
Was playing against a Wraith and he hooked me and the last guy so the match was pretty much over. Was my first hook so I attempted to escape as he was standing in front of me. I yeeted off the hook right in front of him and we stared at each other for a good three minutes. We then proceeded to look for the hatch together and he left me leave.
---
I am sorry, little one
---
Pallet tbagging is annoying mid chase, but it‚Äôs always funny when it back fires
---
What do you mean about denying buffers to the DC epidemic? If you are referring to starting threads about needing DC penalties and getting dismissive replies, it‚Äôs because the devs have said repeatedly that they‚Äôre working on a solution and can‚Äôt do anything until dedicated servers come out. So there is no point in complaining about it on the forums, they may close the threads, I‚Äôm not sure. I only go on there occasionally for the laughs, as that place is extremely killer biased so it‚Äôs funny seeing some of the awful suggestions and complaints people come up with (remove pallets, double gen times...etc). The memes are a little annoying here but overall it‚Äôs a much better place to discuss the game than over there. You will always run into assholes no matter where you go though.
---
I definitely try and do all objectives as survivor through out the match.

PS4 and Xbox Nurse in a nutshell. 1 kill is a lot for one round of Nurse on a non PC platform
---
Mine were shrewed enough to just crouch down and don't move until they bleed out or down them instead of running into some other survs.
---
I am an asian and you would not believe how Toxic asian players can be.
---
I had same resistance issue with Myers' 4 Kill achievement as well. They would deliberately jump into locker to avoid being caught and killed instantly just to deny me the achievement.
---
Until, 1 kind meg helped me out to hunt down a coward bill and get the achievement done.
---
sigh I love it when they are injured and thier the dumbasses who aren't close enough to get downed and escaped and they get hooked
---
I don't think he's as bad as people think he is (I actually think with no add-ons, Doctor and Clown are worse than Freddy) but he does need some sort of change
---
Lol get out of here with that trash.  Camping isn't fun and you know it.  You seriously need to work on learning that killer game bro if camping is still something you gameplan for lol.  You depip, get shit points and get to be bored as fuck standing there staring at pixels.  The doctor prescribes 50 cc's of git gud stat!
---
I should go
---
I‚Äôm a killer main but wait times for killer have been crazy so i‚Äôm back to a survivor for the time being and wow. I just had a match where the killer did not put a single person on the hook and earned no points so i‚Äôm curious as to why people do it.
---
Sorry that I don‚Äôt like to play against a swf who all play as P3 claudettes and have 4 toolboxes
---
The survivor was running object of obsession.
---
This argument is so stupid. Killing survivors is the aim of the killer. If the survivors are dumb enough to *keep* walking into the killer, especially on killers with TRs they deserve to lose the one life they have.
---
It's like whining that you died first in Search and Destroy or R6 and saying the enemy shouldn't have killed you. Get over yourself
---
Yes to both.
---
I got a week ban for messaging a shitty killer. Worst week of my life lol
---
In honor of this clip, I think its time for me to buy Spirit....Right before Ghostface is released lmfao.

SPICEY
---
im 26 years old and dont play with anyone thats a child or pre teen, why are they doing it its not fair when you have nobody to play with and all they do is block me, ignore my messages and decline my invites
---
When you have long wall jungle gym window facing right at the shack pallet exit, and Meg camps it and still gets hit when the killer swings
---
Based on how they look? People do that? Or do you mean items? 
---
I mean if I see 4 toolboxes I really gotta be in the mood for that crap.
---
I've had literally no luck this BP event myself.
---
You're not wrong.  Tunneling survivors is the most efficient way to eliminate them and make the match easier for the killer.  The problem is it ruins the game for the survivors that get tunneled, it just makes the game more fun for everyone if you go for the unhooking survivor.
---
There are instances when all you find is the guy who just got off the hook, and i will usually down them but I leave them on the floor to get picked up.  I try not to hook the same survivor twice in a row. 
---
Unless they blind me a bunch, then maybe I tunnel a bit :)
---
Carefully, he's a hero.
---
There is nothing "smart" about it.  It's a no skill lazy strategy got terrible babykillers and/or trolls who enjoy griefing others.  Actually learn to play the game and then you'll learn that the smart tactic is to play with relentless map pressure, initiate and end efficiently new chases after each hook and keep them wasting time having to perform altruism while you pick them off one by one with gens up.
---
Oh shoot. I figured it had to be something on the survivor end. Thanks!
---
Just killer all the killer mains salivating at mori'ing a tea bagger. Get fucked loser.
---
Most of the games I‚Äôve played that haven‚Äôt been on lerys or the game have had the gates spawn really close to each other where even if you‚Äôre using wake up or any other perks that increase door open speed you still don‚Äôt have time to open the door (especially against hillbillys/nurses/spirits. they either need to fix the distance or door spawns a little or do something to give the last survivor a little bit of a chance. I have also noticed an issue with the hatch itself: I‚Äôve found the hatch first and started the jumping through animation, and the killer was still able to close the hatch, which pushed me out (even though I was mid jump). The endgame is really flawed, and they need to fix some things because it‚Äôs really not fun or fair.

---
Nice try Survivor main. I get more enjoyment out of the extra bloodpoints, thank ye very much.
---
I mean that's frankly a load of crap (although it's clearly how a lot of toxic gamers go through life so not exactly surprising).
---
Win or lose, we play games to actually, you know, play games. Someone camping or tunneling early effectively prevents at least one player from being able to play the game in the first place. This is toxic and unfun, and helps mold the game into a place where the only people who are going to be willing to play survivor are those who can join a swf group. Of course swf is what killers on this sub complain about the most, so pick your poison (not to mention it will lead to the game overall dying).
---
There is no reason other than wanting to be a toxic asshole to down and hook the person who just got unhooked in front of you. Your goal is to win, and when that happens you are being told that a win is guaranteed. Therefore the choice is yours, win by being toxic or win while not being toxic. Just don't be surprised if someone calls you out if you choose the toxic approach.
---
No one said they deserve the escape, but they should at least have the opportunity to TRY, but the structure of the current endgame collapse makes that nearly impossible
---
For me its The Plague.   "LUL Just dont cleanse 4Head"  Great.. then she becomes a hair tuft mikey that you can't even hide from because you are vomiting every 2 seconds, emitting a neon glow, and literally marking everything you touch.
---
It's hilarious when they try this and Endgame Collapse gets them. Doesn't happen often, but when it does: Instant laughs.
---
Was clown around before loli was removed?

Yea that sounds about right

Happy Cake Day!
---
This is so true it hurts. How are you suppose to fight her???
---
I've had to slug as killer, which I don't prefer, but the situation called for it. When survivors are on someone on the ground as soon as they get knocked down, while the others try flashlighting you, it's really all you can do to control the match.
---
But, all 4 ended up on the hook eventually. They were a swf group who were just too cocky.
---
Skill or taking advantage of game mechanics however you want to put it. Plus if the killer goal is to sacrifice as man survivors as he can why would they let any escape? I do agree standing right on top of them is dumb but the consensus on here seems to be if you even roam around the general vicinity looking for the survivor coming to save them you're a camper which is bullshit
---
I'm sure it will be... for 10k aurics.
---
Did you know that if you‚Äôve already lost and the killer slugged you and is just standing on the hatch waiting for you to get there and close it on your face, you can just leave your computer for a few minutes and the game will end?
---
If it bothers you that much that a killer flaunts their victory, then just do even move. Endgame ensures that you die once the hatch is closed.
---
Just go get a drink or watch a movie or TV show while waiting to die
---
What do you expect when your friend unhooks you with the killer on the same tile.  The survivor teabagged so the killer WOULD tunnel them and down them at the pallet knowing that they were going to use DS and then pallet slam to teabag again.  Once the killer embarrassed them in front of their friend, they decided to DC because "fuck this try hard camper" amirite.
---
I think that automatically letting last survivor escape is boring, but being ultra carefull not to let anyone escape is boring (if you really want to 4K, its easy to do). I think a more fun thing to do is to attempt to 4K but not be try hard about it.
---
Well you gotta get good at the game.
---
I love this shit right here.
---
The salty DC. Good job!
---
I mean if it's early game no, because when an unhook happens in those circumstances you are being told you are guaranteed a win. You now have the choice of winning while being toxic and effectively preventing someone from playing in the first place or win while not being toxic by giving them a chance to actually play the game.
---
I mean or you need to get better. I get that a lot of killers think they are God's gift to this game and need to camp/tunnel the first person hooked, but that tells me there are a lot of killers who aren't very good or are lying to themselves about what they actually need to do to win.
---
oh fucking Buh-hu people like playing togeter. Get a grip dude. SWF are not that much harder to play against. Well only if you take a try at it and not just start crying over it.
---
Hey man good on you for not being a tryhard I wouldnt tunnel you.
---
Love me :(
---
For you both to get a couple of extra blood points?
---
Killers also have overpowered add-ons as well. Cant remember the last time I went against a killer that didnt have instasaw, 3 blinks, scratched mirror, infinite tier 3, prayer beads, body blocking hag, coxcomb Clapper, etc. Even the shitty add-ons can pair nicely with the overpowered ones. Hell, killers even have moris or dying light. Even a green mori early game can drastically slow down everything.
---
I don't even think that's the issue for most people, playing against a 4-stack of certain items can be obnoxious as hell.  
---
You could easily jack on Franklin's and what not and just whack a mole but I still think you gotta be in the mood for that, since it changes the gameplay drastically.
---
The first time i went against her i actually alt+f4 out i got so scared
---
Hippocrips
---
That I can understand. It‚Äôs just when there is no effort to put anyone on a hook and you run around downing people even when they aren‚Äôt around who you just slugged is really scummy. I understand maybe wanting to depip but with wait times being so long a match ending because of that in less than two minutes is annoying.
---
&gt;acting like survivors don't have all the tools they need to avoid getting caught by a killer
---
Your comment is in the negatives at the time I put this. Sorry to see that so many jerks think insta heals (purple or pink) with MoM isn't toxic. These people are the same ones who say NOED is broken because it rewards losers yet don't understand how getting hit a bunch then being rewarded for it by MoM is toxic.
---
i‚Äôm not saying that
---
unless it‚Äôs confirmed, like bill‚Äôs case, they‚Äôre probably from the same timeline
---
why are you trying to push this anyways?
---
The best part is when the survivor who just got unhooked, try to bodyblock the one who saved them, bc if you go for the just unhooked surv ur tunneling.
---
I run bloody party streamers as the killer. Can't get camped by the killer if you're the killer
---
Holy shit that's so big brained, thank god I never see it
---
for 300% instead of 200% bp? Yeah I definitely still want muh stacks
---
I run BBQ, so my first priority before anything else is hooking all 4. Even if everyone escapes, I want my 100% BPs, so I'm the first to hook.
---
I don't get slugging just to slug. But then, I usually don't **try** to de-pip.
---
Yeah when I see a Hag I immediately know I'm gonna have a bad time. Many of her trap spots are unpredictable and on sone maps they are hard af to see. Then you have the camera turn that makes it so your camera faces towards the trap which always confuses me and gers me hit.

I'm not sure if this subreddit can take those...might break someone's world view
---
They should also add a player rating feature, where you can downvote toxic players (this counts both DCers/teabaggers and tunnels/campers alike).. then when your rating gets low enough you can only get matched up against fellow toxic players.  Make the game better for the rest of us who just wanna play the game.
---
Yeah I don't know what's going on. AFAIK you're hosting as killer, right? So you should be able to get into it in seconds. It's weird how it's taking me 5-10 minutes just to create a lobby.
---
I think the person is more trying to express the fact that they wish there was more of a chance to even play in the endgame. When you‚Äôre the last survivor, there‚Äôs basically nothing to do (killer always seems to find the hatch first, but even if they don‚Äôt, there‚Äôs a glitch where they can still close the hatch while you jump in, which will push you out of it so even though hatch grabs are gone they can still stop you lol) and the issue with how lose exit gates spawn on most of the maps. Even if you use survivor perks that increase the speed in which you open the door, it still isn‚Äôt enough to open it before they get back. A lot of times as last survivor, there‚Äôs no point in even trying in the endgame, and it doesn‚Äôt make sense that it is structured the way it is. 
---
Either way, your response was a little out of hand lol. Youre suffering big time from the us vs them mentality when someone is discussing real issues with balance in the game, and in no way effects you or your gameplay. Also, like, all the survivors can play optimally and still have 3 get killed before the last gen; that doesn‚Äôt mean anyone‚Äôs bad and it‚Äôs definitely not a loss (escaping isn‚Äôt necessarily a ‚Äúwin,‚Äù since the game is based more on a point system- sure you get points for escaping, but that‚Äôs just part of a category and there‚Äôs four categories; same for killer, just because you got a 4K doesn‚Äôt mean, based on points, that you won- a 4K with only 4 hooks is way worse than a 2K with 9 hooks or something). 
---
At any rate, people are allowed to discuss problems with the game, and currently, there are a lot of balance issues, so of course people will talk about them lol
---
Someone is always going to get caught (I mean, unless the killer is hot garbage). Me being good enough not to get caught doesn't somehow make killers not be toxic, it just makes them not toxic to me.
---
Of course that's part of the problem, too many gamers only give a shit about themselves and are happy to let other people get fucked over.
---
So your saying the devs need to cater to cry baby survivors who can't handle losing? "Oh, the killer is actually killing people? Better DC"
---
This happens once in a blue moon
---
probably already has
---
All is fair, not all is well lol
---
Why are killers so afraid of items? It's part of the game. I know some survivors do, but imagine if all survivors started to DC against billy or nurse, because they don't want to put up with their crap. 
---
"I only want to play against weak killers, everyone else, DC" and you have to go back to lobby wait 5 minutes to get dc'ed on again, because you play the wrong killer. 
---
And I like how you imagine how people will play just because of how they look. I sometimes play Claudette and I ran around everywhere, usually get found first and die first. I just play her because she feels intuitive to control, not because she is hard to see.
---
The power would need some tuning to be better, but this is some good shit. Only question what would tiffany's weapon be
---
Cool story bro
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs he said vs she said.
---
The killer needs to hook people, it‚Äôs his objective and survivors need to do gens and do hook rescues in order to achieve the main goal of escaping. But some players don‚Äôt get this. We both need each other (Survivor&amp;Killer) and allot camp from the start. What allot of players don‚Äôt realize is camping &amp; tunneling people to death off the hook keeps new players from wanting to play more and stay with this game, when all the scumbags and new killers do it repeatedly in the lower ranks on PS4... 
---
I agree with the original post though, don‚Äôt unhook someone in front of the killer duh! Problem is you get asshole solo teammates who will sandbag you and there is nothing you can do. So I go after the unhooker especially if they do it in front of me since most games are solo random players.
---
But what about Mrs. Piggy
---
"Like, fifteen of you got compensated so we're just gonna say this is solved"
---
Yes I'm very homophobic just ask my ex boyfriend
---
yeah its rly weird
---
I think there's a big difference between playing like this at rank 15 and rank 4. At rank 15 you are going to blow through survivors no matter what, and the people you are up against are going to practically throw themselves at you. These are also the people who need that practice to get better, and who are most likely to be pushed away by toxic play.
---
I avoid it at rank 4 if I can, but if nothing else swf teams are way more rampant there.
---
So tbagging is toxic but camping isnt? Noted
---
Would help if the killer quit spawning next to me. That bug is back.
---
&gt;survivors need to take ownership in their own mistakes
---
But this is the fundamental problem, it's not their mistake. They don't get to choose when to be unhooked, and so what is actually happening is that you are punishing one person for someone elses mistake.

Preach

Had a match with a 4k where one guy in the end game said he let me win (which he did give up at the end), then just started tearing me a new one without once referring to something in the game. Just went fucking nuts calling me an asshole but not once did he mention what annoyed him.
---
Why is it always about survivors when people say this? Where are the survivors saying "hey this is a game, it's about having fun, so I'll go ahead and sacrifice some of my points and let the killer have it" where those people at? Funny how killers can be expected to sacrifice some of their points but survivors never are.
---
&gt; Survivors complain if the game takes too long
---
3 gen doc is not fun
---
&gt;I even had a survivor complain about having 'OP' brown add-ons
---
Billy has broken brown add-ons
---
Y
---
There is nothing wrong about discussing lore. Because there aren't much. You created your own theory, I only share my own. 
---
Well the developer created hillbilly as an leatherface substitute, because they couldn't get the rights at first. It was never stated that both lived in the same universe. 
---
Same as legion for Ghostface. Also the Ghostface in dead by daylight has a different backstory than the Ghostface in the movies. Which could imply multiple timelines and worlds.
---
Amanda backstory fit 100% from Amanda in the movies. Which could imply that the entity took her after she died in the movie.
---
And the survivor Bill fought against zombies before he came to the realm of the entity. Other survivors didn't experience the zombie apocalypse. Which also could imply multiple timelines and world.
---
I hate when they whine about that and it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all here, where tf am I supposed to go? Morocco? I‚Äôm supposed to chase you guys.‚Äù
---
I feel you can have them both have them, but killer map offering trumps survivor offerings no matter what.
---
This sub need quality control
---
I said there is a chance, it's happened to me countless times as soon as I leave to go patrol the other (on two connected walls mind you) once I get back the gate is getting opened and I'm lucky to get a hit on a survivor and I didn't even stay at the other switch long, I literally looked at it and then turned around. The trip back was plenty to get the gate open for those survivors, are they just better than you? Or is it already balanced? Sure with high tier killers it's a lot more difficult but they're high tier for a reason. The hatch is bugged sure. But the killer can interrupt the animation anyway by pressing a different button so how is that any different? if anything it gives you a higher chance to escape then going directly onto the killers shoulder. at least there's no longer one sided standoffs.
---
How about, we apply the same mentality as I do in LoL, if someone is toxic, just mute and move on
---
A lot of people are playing killer for bloodhunt, and each game takes up a chunk of the server.
---
This is how I look while cleansing lit totems especially Devour Soap... I rub my hands together before hand and give a snicker, then wondering if the killer will immediately DC...
---
I don't remember the name of the Legion or the map, because I'm super smart that way, but I do remember they basically found me as Nea almost instantly and stood right behind me without swinging until we went looking for pallets and hooks.  I think it was Susie with the map-wide thing, too!
---
The BP earned during the BloodHunt makes games feel ‚Äúworth it‚Äù to me
---
Like the time I wait to get a game and then playing it only to get 4k for being tunneled and killed first sucks but the simple 8k boost is like ‚ÄúYeah ok I‚Äôll take it‚Äù
---
Even if they just halved the price of all things in the blood web that‚Äôs be nice, just something that doesn‚Äôt make it seem like getting all the good perks on the character you wanna play take forever
---
Hell, lemme pay 2k shards for any teachable once a week, that‚Äôs fine too!
---
I gotta say I really hate Hag. Though a significant part of it is just other survivors have no idea what the fuck killer powers do so they set off traps at awful times and urban evade while she's across the map chasing someone.
---
‚ÄúNaturally I‚Äôm talking about high tiers killers‚Äù
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the point. 90% of the roster is unviable against good Survivors.
---
Ok, I see your point. But it is not like that for me. If this game was less competitive, more horror-like, or at least the community wasn't this toxic  than I would've tried to make an enjoyable match for survivors. But it's not like this, thus I'm playing just for my personal enjoyment. I worked hard to hook this motherfucker, so why should I let them run away just to satisfy their ego? And besides, I never intended to camp in the first place, I wanted to go for a gen nearby, but at least on consoles 2/3 of survivors have an IQ of a sandwich, so they're rushing for a rescue no matter how far is a killer. This is pissing me off both as a killer and as a survivor.
---
Sorry for mistakes, english is not my native language and I have little to no practice in writing in it.
---
I don't think of them as an objective when I'm the survivor end, but more as a potential counter to a perk.  Same way killers have to play around potential perks they suspect a survivor may have like dead hard or decisive strike.  
---
If you (and your teammates) choose to ignore totems and straight gen rush, then you're gambling your own fate.  I very rarely use NOED because it just doesn't help me, but I will still defend it because I just don't find it to be that big a deal.
---
I didn't get shit!!!!
---
If it‚Äôs a mechanic intended to be used in game, you are not wrong for using it. Period. Anyone that tells you different is wrong and stupid.
---
A survivor running straight to an infinite after beginning a chase is as fun for the killer as a killer camping the survivor. You can‚Äôt be mad at the survivor for using it though because they are just using the mechanics given to them intended to be used.
---
Use make your choice if you want to. Or don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs completely up to you. Again, refer to my first paragraph.
---
wahhh, the game isnt killer sided enough
---
Closing the hatch starts the timer even if the doors aren't open.
---
as a killer.  please just go.
---
Every SWF ever. You turn to leave then boom unhook. Of course I‚Äôm gonna turn around dude.
---
Boi have you yet to seen Claudettes on the swamp
---
I have to get the killers I‚Äôm still new to it honestly so I don‚Äôt have all perks
---
It‚Äôs the best feeling in the world, isn‚Äôt it?
---
I can't. too immersed
---
Jack Torrence from the shining, hedge maze and Overlook hotel map would be amazing, power would be fear related and maybe he can break through a few things like Windows and stuff? Idk.
---
Freddy is getting a full rework the next patch (around August). I'd say wait until then to decide whether or not he is worth buying.
---
And this is how Nurse mains are born.
---
Closing the hatch does but not completing gens
---
I think pretty much all of us can agree ebony moris need to be changed. Thing is I don't know how should it be changed, if they make it so that you need to hook them twice then that would make it too weak, since you just skip the time to carry the survivor to the hook. I wouldn't mind if that happened though since ebony moris are insanely strong. Ivory moris (green) just like you said are fine.
---
because it revards players for underperforming. If all gens are powered and you still cant put out the map pressure to stop the gates than you just simply dont deserv the kills. I dont really have too much on the perk because it can be outplayed easily but I understand the frustration over it.
---
For the survivor, yes 
---
For the killer, not so much
---
That must have been terrible getting messages that accused you of camping after you just...camped them all game.
---
Go play on PC then man. Survivors over here love to cry after every match.
---
I mean it's the same reason taunts are in fighting games. Enrage them into making bad decisions.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking :/
---
I mean, from what I understand the entity promised she could have revenge if she killed all these people for it. And she's really pissed, so she's fine with it.
---
Ruin the game as in, you don't get an easy win and have to play an actually hard match? Playing against survivors who actually can fight back is a nightmare?
---
I played fair share against swf groups, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Toxic swf usually do nothing all game, you see it's swf with few flashlights, you bring lightborn and get an easy win. If it's gen rushing swf group, leave the "runner" alone and go for weaklings gen rushers. Not so nightmarish.
---
This has "Does Bruno Mars is gay" vibes
---
The best is when you check gens then return to the unhook spot and your Nurse‚Äôs Calling goes off. Then you get called out for tunneling. Like dude I checked all the gens then returned and I‚Äôm not just gonna ignore my Nurse‚Äôs Calling lol.
---
Apparently we have to go onto their support page file a ticket with relevant information
---
Seems a little op but still great
---
If this were on PC I guarantee you would have caught a novella of abuse and salt from those survivors.
---
NOED*
---
Anyone bringing up send with nurse instantly remind me of Shorty from Scary movie 2
---
I can't believe Trapper is above average..
---
well i‚Äôm considering it very unlikely for this situation? don‚Äôt see why you have to hound after my theory here 
---
i‚Äôm not the one calling you a dumbass
---
Godamnit doc! You ruined it
---
yeah, no
---
just leave, don't make the killer lose time for 200bp, it's retarded
---
yeah but their interpretation of survivors unhooking while they camp is that theyre greedy or stupid. They dont even consider some having empathy lmao. look at the downvotes this obviously triggered some people
---
Playing survivor is not hard, but you don't really get much input on how the game goes unless you're doing gens.
---
Killer decides to go after you when you've just been unhooked? Welp guess I'll die. It's when you get into a SWF group that survivors gain the tactical advantage
---
I have spent shards here and there, but currently I‚Äôm level 88 Devotion 8.
---
because the points don't worth the lost time.
---
Oh that‚Äôs pretty good then I guess. Appreciate all the info thanks for taking the time out of your day to help a noob!
---
Starting a new match usually takes like 10 minutes for me.
---
You're right about the first part but on PlayStation, all you have to do is click on their name then click the buttons then message. I've never played on Xbox so I wouldn't know I'm just a die-hard PlayStation boy
---
Was playing killer and literally just loaded on to get a noise notification. I go to investigate to find the god pallet dropped. I don‚Äôt know who or why but broke it and moved on
---
Nice
---
Yeah I jump between ps4 and PC and it's actually very different. Leatherface is way better on console than PC
---
Yeah, this wouldn't work at all.
---
It's a fair race until someone has tenacity
---
Here's a really crazy idea but hear me out. Don't rush in within 15 second of me hooking someone. What the fuck point is it to run off if I can see people trying to sneak up or run up because they feel like blitzing the survivor instead of trying to work on gens? You guys want to say camping but maybe make the killer work for it it's dumb to think they're just going to leave when someone runs right up to get someone off the hook.
---
I don't know, it seems to fluctuate a lot.
---
one minute somebody is saying that MoM is worse than old DS, the next somebody is complaining that there aren't enough pallets on a map when they throw em down as soon as they get to them
---
I think killers shouldnt be able to see what character we are playing or what items we are bringing.. keep a 100%fair.  The amount of lobby dodging that goes on is insane... but killers can run iri heads, all seeing, mirror Myers, Amanda's letter, z block freddy, I mean the list goes on and on... we have to go in blinded and unaware how bad the match is gonna be. So should the killer.
---
How so?
---
I was just thinking this earlier in the thread too! Like if these guys went to r/Rainbow6 and had the argument that defenders should let the attackers in before they shoot each other in the name of fair game, they'd be laughed out of the sub. That's how asymmetrical games are. Each side has advantages and disadvantages. Survivors have the numbers advantage, the killers only job is to kill the survivors. Also if you hit the healthy survivor rather than the unhooked, you literally reward the healthy survivor with points for a safe hook when it was the most unsafe time to do so. 
---
 I would even argue that the lore supports this tactic in that the entity feeds off hope. What better way to generate that tasty hope for the entity than to allow a survivor to be unhooked then immediately rehooking that survivor.
---
x2 bp is almost over, your queues should be faster after that
---
*Whines about not being able to get max score literally every game.*
---
&gt;I‚Äôm trying to figure out what level you have to be to have all those shards üòÇüòÇ I am new player only level 31 and I have 5,000 ugh it‚Äôs such a grind I just wnat my spirit
---
It depends whether or not you spent some shards since they introduced this system. 
---
If you never spend anything, at exactly level 400 you would have 101.080 shards.
---
You don't have to fall all the way down, just fall off the edge near the top. it only takes a bit of practice to get the right fall height
---
Yea, I know good swf is almost unbeatable, the thing is, good swf are a rare thing. I played on both PS4 and PC for good few hundred hours at least on both platforms, red ranks on both sides, very rarely do I run into god like swf groups who just destroys you. I can't really recall one actually. It's usually as I said toxic trolls, no0b3/ochido wannabes, who you destroy easily with right perks or one guy with flashlight and 3 toolboxes, he tries to take your attention, while others gen rush. When as I said, pick up weaklings, leave the runner to follow you around try to flash save.
---
"Whoa what are you doing? You cant come over here when i am unhooking my mate, you go back to your corner right now!" 
---
"Okay...i will just - waiiiiiiiit a minute!!!!"
---
I figured as much from your reply. I have both consoles and a gaming laptop and play this game across all three platforms. PlayStation has the worst setup for quick communication or communication in general. I hate the fact it opens up a group that you have to leave just to say GG.
---
Please watch this video as a correction to my past "statements"

For all of the comments speculating on why BHVR didn't make the original Ghostface outfit, they don't have the rights. The mask and the outfit had seperate copyrights and BHVR only wanted the rights to use the mask. So if they tried to make the original outift as a cosmetic, they'd be sued for violating the terms of their copyright. It's also why BHVR will have their own lore for Ghostface since they didn't get rights to the Scream character either. Again, just the mask.
---
I'd let vommy mommy vomit in my mouth
---
Play how you want.  My aim is to get 8 hooks and let everyone survive.  I want it to feel like an intense but positive match for everyone.  Sometimes I‚Äôll kill someone if they have a really annoying build.  Otherwise most of my kills this weekend came from people DCing on their first down.
---
After you complete the action, wouldn‚Äôt you still be crouched?
---
You didn't say the last two ran up while you were still there. You said it was because they went for the hooked people, period. Which would only be a mistake if you were camping. Hence the conclusion.
---
I expirienced these kind of teams 4 times anually. Im sorry but if you allways gotta play like this to be prepared for swfs than my god... Plus why waste your times if you cant keep up with these teams just dc and go into the next round
---
He's calling it tunneling when he's the only survivor left. At that point, it's not tunneling. :D
---
lmao well done
---
The point of the End Game collapse is to end the game once the gates are open so survivors can't hold the game hostage with bad killers. 
---
I actually posted a video of a survivor trying to escape as the end game started (I closed the hatch). With a little chase, and me letting them leave, they STILL didn't make it out in time.
---
You'd essentially be giving free kills to bad killers, as it'd almost guarantee one or two die trying to get to the gates.
---
We all seem to be having trouble--Someone else in my lobby keeps disconnecting during the loading screen, or someone is just idle in game. I've never seen it actually get this bad before
---
I get that but when a player is insured and leaving blood and scratch marks why would the killer not go for them when they're supposed to kill them? It's a core game design for being able to track people.
---
Ideally they should be completing gens to force the killer to actually chase them, instead of just waiting around the corners of the hooked survivor
---
I‚Äôm just here for he memes.  Most discussions killer/survivor discussions go about as well as a Hillary/Trump supporter discussion.
---
Why would you DC and lose rank pips, add-ons, and offerings that you burned? It's only a waste of time if you let the SWF team think they're good and let them escape.
---
But if you do the opposite and focus gens with one ally hooked, the killer will throw a tantrum about gen rushing, and how it's unfair and antithetical to the game...
---
Well, it‚Äôs reassuring that it ain‚Äôt just me who‚Äôs having this issue.
---
lol
---
But killers aren‚Äôt supposed to kill and give a reason for survivs to fear us, we‚Äôre supposed to fear the survivs!!! Or have you not seen all the memes?
---
On ps4 I made it all the way to rank 8 with Leatherface, just using his m1, and chainsawing pallets. Once and awhile I would punish an unsafe hook or if I stumble on 2 survivors in a tight area, with a chainsaw.
---
No, he did not. He only said the first one did. He actually said he walked away after the second one but then immediately turned around.
---
Bruh
---
&gt; You said it was because they went for the hooked people, period. Which would only be a mistake if you were camping. 
---
Not what he said at all:
---
&gt; and go check a gen and see scratch marks from the distance on the building so I hurry back and catch both
---
Hmmm, maybe you just missed it.
---
True, but sometimes you just can't be arsed to sweat your balls off against a fully-kitted team.
---
I agree, I spend my shards on bloodpoints or teachable if there's one I like, that's about it :p
---
You acknowledge later that camping requires the killer being at the hook. Yet you ignore they went to check gens and what not. Hence downvotes. But hey - you must be one of those survivors who doesnt think.
---
Absolutely. Franklin's is a weirdly appropriate response to BM that you unfortunately can't pick after the BM starts.
---
No the ranking system should determine what players you matchmaker with
---
I've never even heard of them
---
MoM is RIP, but DS is still very good.
---
We all feel your pain
---
Killers:  OMG Nerf survivors they're so OP this game is so survivor sided!
---
Also Killers:  OMG Killer queues are so long, where are all the survivors?!
---
I don't watch Rooster teeth but I really enjoy watching HybridPanda play it. I also like watching Ohmwrecker play it when he plays survivor.
---
He briefly walked away, didn't leave enough time to rescue them, and immediately turned around. In what was is that materially different from camping?
---
Redirecting your camera should be removed. She's fine aside from that.
---
I know that but I mean there‚Äôs no benefit from ranking up other than playing with better people and having the rank to show for it. As I understand there are no rewards.
---
I think they are downvoting because you are wrong. The killer isnt supposed to be nice, hes a killer. If the killer was "nice" every game then everyone should be leaving the game with max bloodpoints and 0 deaths. That's just farming and I'd boring and defeats the purpose of the game.
---
Not sure what the issue was there, but I went straight through him. Hitboxes are terrible though - annoys me when the killer swings nowhere near me but I get hit
---
Same here, I also like watching farmer john
---
OP stated they've only been playing killer for 4 days and they swing a lot to try to learn the hitboxes
---
That's pretty stupid from the survivors. But really, I wish I didn't get facecamped matches in a row ;-;
---
But leveling provides shards so it's not just like ranking.
---
You could say the same thing about Sprint Burst, since that makes people walk everywhere.
---
Remember crouching with UE3 is roughly the same speed as walking.
---
Downvotes for disagreement and insults. You're reinforcing everything I ever assumed about people who camp.
---
Also, get ready to have your mind blown: I mostly play killer except when friends invite me. I just don't play to ruin people's days.
---
Here's a stance: playing optimally is not fucking toxic. If you get unhooked next to the killer, get mad at your shitty teammate rather than the killer taking advantage of the opportunity in front of them. They don't owe you shit.
---
gonna be honest. i just started learning nurse recently... i hate it.
---
This isn't always the case and you know it. And like others said, don't bitch about "gen rushing"
---
I never said they were supposed to be nice? looks like youre wrong, buddy. I said they interpret survivors actions to be based out of greed and stupidity, not guilt. you just decided to be a dickhead for no reason lmao
---
You'd rather bang spirirt which is a living corpse (necrophilia btw) then huntress? get outta heeee
---
Hippobloods
---
Would be nice to have, as a survivor, some kind of kick your ally away from grabbing you off the hook.
---
Guess who i main as survivor? Both ash and meg ffs
---
(But they look cool though for me so thats why xd)
---
Dropping a pallet when the killer already hit you is just stupid honestly, the cooldown on the swing is longer than the pallet stun and when you pallet stun them it directly skips the attack cooldown
---
WOW that Laurie was stupid. How do you mess up that pallet.
---
Get Bubba to level 35 for BBQ and Chili, the best perk in the game.  
---
Get David King to level 30 for We're Gonna Live Forever, which grants you 25% more bloodpoints for every stack you get(gained by safe unhooks or taking hits for teammates).  
---
Prestiging isn't worth it because you don't get anything for it besides the cosmetics, so only prestige if you're a completionist.
---
They get a sprint burst? I never knew that.
---
I'll wait sometimes for this and because it draws the killer away for a few seconds to chase me out. If I'm the last one or everyone else is there I won't wait but if someone else is still coming to the gates or opening the other gates I'll wait to give them some extra time. But I'll never Tbag
---
Those are not mutually exclusive whatsoever
---
Console players suck so hard lmao
---
I always wait an extra three seconds after the heartbeat goes away to take someone off the hook
---
the servers aren't down tho
---
I'm sorry I thought you were playing Dead by Daylight, not Princess Priscilla's happy fun time survivor simulator. It's asymetric survival, don't whine that the killer can get one out of four if they camp - just don't be the one.
---
In 40 minutes.
---
How dare you
---
Recomend bubba for that even If I play mostly survivor?
---
I've watched it twice now. There are two Laurie's. One that made her whiff twice teabagged like crazy then stayed on the harvester. OP left that one on the harvester to go after a completely different Laurie that didn't teabag until after the unhook.
---
Dude same. Like, thanks for the 5k blood points guys. Very cool.
---
bruh. the hole at the top of the keyhole is a bit bigger. I wonder what's that for
---
I NEED the original video, that's brilliant
---
That makes literally no sense at all
---
Prestiging your characters gives you better items on your bloodweb on the next go around, so I'd suggest at least going P1 on your "main" character.
---
What I did was went to 30-35 on characters that I wanted teachables, both surviver and killer, and then P1 on my mains.
---
I'd like to eventually have every teachable unlocked on both sides, but that'll take time.
---
Toxic DC is just admitting defeat to me. It‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Teabagging at the exit gate is the worst
---
Missing like 5 lunges though.....
---
Pretty sure winning as killer, especially against a T-bagger, isn't ruining anyones day. Plus people aren't using mori's every time obviously.
---
Like playing hide and seek with children
---
hax obvi
---
Never before have I been struck with such knowledge and experience. My eyes have been opened by your amazing brain power and now I use mine at 1,000,000,000%.
---
Plague bruping you
---
It was on the Gas Heaven map :3
---
I want to make you hurty
---
I think you should be able to disable her trap by swiping the ground with your palm if you crouch up to it. I think that would be fair honestly. Just make it take a few seconds like with Trapper's traps.
---
Actually, if the killer camps 1 survivor, the other 3 tend to have a low score at the end because they don't points from interacting with the killer. This also can result in them not pipping. Mostly a flaw in the system though imo. Kind of like how devout emblem requires the killer to hook at least 9 times, so too ez of a 4k means you might not pip as killer
---
Yeah. Same with Legion.
---
Wait. Really?
---
Excuse me? Ill have you know that the only objective is getting my sweet wglf stacks during 2x bp events.
---
Two things wrong with your statement
---
-Phrasing this in terms of percentage is silly when it comes to an asymmetric game, bc each round only has one killer so any perk that reveals a killer‚Äôs aura in your eyes is going to reveal ‚Äú100% of killers‚Äù yeah no shit that‚Äôs how percentages work when there‚Äôs only 1 of something
---
-The key part of your reply is ‚Äúwhen in a group‚Äù that‚Äôs not an effect of OoO, that‚Äôs an effect of SWF being able to use comms.
---
*Aggressive zomby noises*
---
If the Plague wasn't rotting, she would be up with Rin and Amanda.
---
If you look at some of his cosmetics canonically his right nipple I believe was torn off
---
I mean, I guess if you're hot garbage. Until you get to rank 7 or 8 you are pretty much guaranteed to win as a killer.
---
This the options are win like an asshole or win not like an asshole.
---
Ok
---
Ah. This happened once. 3 survivors left. Two on hooks, and the 3rd complains because I wasn't stupid enough to go patrol gens when they kept hopping between the two hooks.
---
Special add-ons let you kill survivors by your own hand after certain conditions are met. The cypress momento mori lets you kill a survivor if they are the last one remaining in the trial. The ivory momento mori lets you kill a survivor if he/she has been hooked once. The ebony momento mori lets you kill all survivors that have been hooked at least once
---
You think urban hard counters Hag? So you probably urbanly evade across the whole map even if she is chasing you? Hag's power doesn't lie only in protecting hooks, because you have to catch someone to get hook pressure. Good luck with getting someone without a good web with 110% MS killer. Flashlights hurt Hag more than Urban but it's not like her entire power is destroyed by one flashlight. You don't chase with Hag, you are at several places at the same time and survivors are completely confused who are you "chasing" right now.
---
Imagine being the exact type of person this post was aimed at. It's not camping if you don't allow the killer to leave. Its not that hard to have someone doing a gen, or wait for killer to leave
---
If that's your experience then you're just fucking bad. Keep pushing your arbitrary rules on others and making excuses, you're not going to get better.
---
Happened two me twice, on spirit and plague
---
Wrong. A good Hag creates a web, someone activates a trap, gets hit and run away to another trap, gets downed. Hag's power doesn't lie only in hook traps.
---
And I quote ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to farm‚Äù
---
Idgit, you do realize that the basement is BELOW GROUND, and it actually takes several seconds to get down there, and unhook someone, and then run back out, right? It's precisely why it's the ideal place to hook someone - even if they are unhooked, you have a small window to down them none the less. 
---
Hooking someone in the basement, actively LEAVING THE BASEMENT, going and kicking a gen, then heading back to deal with any potential altruists, IS NOT FUCKING CAMPING. 
---
What the hell do you not understand about that?
---
Love me some achievement hunter, so it's always great to see them play dbd. They're real bad at it though with the exception of Jeremy and, to a lesser extent, Ryan.
---
Wraith has the only OP brown add ons.
---
I wish all killers had cool shit like that.
---
I overlooked Urban Evasion for a long time and once I finally tried it out, it was a game changer. I now use Spine Chill and Urban Evasion in virtually every game because it allows me to focus almost exclusively on gens while sneaking away from the killer when they come to inspect.  
---
Start gen. Sense killer. Sneak away. Sneak back. Finish gen. Rinse and repeat. It's so helpful.
---
And these add ons go away after one use?
---
Well then that‚Äôs on them for playing stupidly. The idea is that if they keep losing games because they face camp, they‚Äôll have to change their ways if they want to change that
---
Hag is underrated in this game she is easily 5th best killer die to her counter play taking up time from the survivors to crouch everywhere.
---
Guys, we've been going in circles for years now. It's time to start laying the blame where it belongs.

BHVR has been doing everything they can to avoid addressing one big problem: This game does not and never has had a single satisfying competitive element. The game is not fun for killers or survivors when the killer can't find survivors to chase, and chases are absurdly feast or famine, to the point where the fun is almost always had only by whoever gets themselves in a comfortable position to win, which is often decided in the first minute or so of the game. The only time anybody has fun in this game is when two parties are in a near perfect balance of effectiveness, either by coincidence or one side deliberately playing noncompetitive to the level of their opponents. 
---
As a killer, I can play for the win, and do everything I can to hobble survivor progress from minute one so that I can keep the enemy team on a treadmill that allows me to beat the shit out of them while they make no significant progress, or I can play for fun, and repeatedly let survivors back into the game, and in the event that survivors actually try hard to win, guarantee my own loss as soon as a couple gens get completed without an early kill. 
---
Killers, you don't want survivors to play optimally, they will destroy you every game unless you play super-sweaty with a character with god-tier global map pressure. Every time a meme like this makes the front page, I promise you there are hundreds of survivor mains cracking their knuckles thinking "well, if you insist" before giving us all the games that make us want to come right back here and post about how broken SWF is. How long to we have to be stuck in this loop before we demand BHVR stop trying to sell us the next balancing nightmare and start coming up with solutions to the foundational problems that have haunted us since pre-release. It shouldn't be on the players to hobble themselves for the sake of making this game fun.
---
Figure out how to make chases fun and competitive, and build the game entirely around them. Survivors need more options than pallet and window loops. Killers need to be able to chase a survivor for five seconds without the survivors completing three gens and winning in the first minute. These aren't easy problems to solve but they've been around for years, and if the can doesn't stop getting kicked the playerbase will keep shrinking until it's not worth logging on anymore. And if the devs do decide to overhaul the game, players are going to have to be patient. I think that there's so much potential in this game but in many aspects it's made no progress since its inception.
---
I do it on both. If I had a nice killer I'll sacrifice myself (EGC still counts as sacrifice points for the killer). If I go through the whole game and the killer hasnt gotten any/many hooks I will point at a hook so they can get the points/BBQ stack. Unfortunately some killers facecamp and dont get as many points as the could have but...
---
whats RBT?
---
Between being part of a SWF and running this build, I'd be pretty stoked to have killed you seeing as it's almost impossible to do so otherwise. Let's see:
---
MoM: Rewards you for losing. Getting hit is going against your objective and this perk grants you a 3rd hit because you've been hit.
---
Deliverance: Allows you to escape the hook after making a rescue. Not a very good perk but can be paired with DS.
---
Decisive Strike: Allows you to escape the killer's shoulder if caught twice in 60 seconds. Only good when used with Deliverance.
---
Unbreakable: Can recover from dying state once. Bad perk on it's own, buy between being unable to camp the Deliverance user, tunnel the DS user, or play normally versus the MoM user, it also takes slugging out of the equation. Pair this with a team waiting to tag in and bodyblock for you and I don't think any killer outside of Leatherface could kill you with this build seeing as he could chainsaw any bodyblockers.
---
Unfortunately because of rank reset, there‚Äôs actually a ton of killers camping while survivors aren‚Äôt swarming the hook.
---
Oh sorry, they're not add-ons. They're offerings, which are discarded at the beginning of the trial
---
Good. I‚Äôm glad people like you have to wait for your games. Maybe if you didn‚Äôt stack the deck in your favor more people would be willing to play with you.
---
You should try playing killer, don't be scared
---
I've only had a few, but one stuck out to me, Ruin, Thanataohobia  Bamboozle, Dying Light, J. Myers Memorial, and Fragrant Tuft Of Hair. This Myers basement camped the obsession then slugged the rest of the survivors. Hooked two and they killed themselves, Myers picked up the last survivor and dropped them in front of the hatch an closed it. Then he finished the game by shaking his head at the downed survivor until they either bleed out or died from EGC. That game almost ruined this weekend for me.
---
The killer was punished hard for facecamping by having 2 gebs completed without any contest and you say it doesnt force the killer to chase?
---
Hmm. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be insensitive here because I really do empathize with the idea. However, you‚Äôd run a huge risk of having survivors left and right saying they‚Äôre genuinely fearful of nurses and chainsaws to avoid playing higher-tier killers.
---
I'd be a bigger fan of Identity V if the ping wasnt so atrocious. You try to turn left, run straight at a wall for 3 seconds, and then skip to somewhere else after being hit somehow.
---
I didn't ask you to poorly define "camping" over and over. I'm asking what the material difference is. If it's still impossible to rescue them, how is that any better?
---
How, by bringing an medkit?
---
I completely agree with you, I‚Äôm trying to unhook somebody and there is 2 other survivors running my way.
---
Well... by the ‚Äòactual movie‚Äô, you mean Scary Movie which is a parody of Scream.
---
My experience is killer is a cakewalk until rank 7 or 8. As a survivor my experience is until rank 7 or so my teammates are trying to throw themselves at the killer, and it's frustrating to see when killers are toxic to those people for no reason.
---
You act like a word is going to make a difference. You lost, that's all that should matter, don't make stupid ass saves and you won't lose. Labeling it with a word thinking it's going to bother or hurt feelings doesn't change the fact you lost over a stupid play Lmao. Call the killer tunneling all you want, he beat you üòÇ
---
Why does the killer have to respect it? I break it all the time.
---
You're being downvoted because your reading comprehension is astonishingly bad, not because people are disagreeing.
---
Ive platinumed the base game lol. im just not. sweaty douchebag
---
Divine intervention at it's finest.
---
"NOED is op because it saves bad killers from getting no kills!"
---
This build: exists.
---
This .gif is slightly unsettling. The Entity approves.
---
Not sure if you're trolling, illiterate, or really that much of a whiner.
---
They're "toxic" because they want to win you ignoramus.
---
I dont even play swf and i got no joke  tunneled to death for over 10 games in a row. My worst streak ever :( also had 4 bps and an iri huntress. Never get a break it feels lmao
---
Shit tier meme
---
Ignore it &amp; toughen up.
---
Yup i want to play against people with 5k hours and legacy that all joined at the same time
---
it doesn't matter if you're the one, you still won't pip. THAT'S the issue.
---
Survivor: *Tea-bags*
---
Killer: *Mori‚Äôs survivor*
---
Also Survivor: *Surprised pikachu face*
---
It's always unstable for me regardless if I'm on wifi or wireless, itll go from 60 and then spike to 400 and then drop to 60 and it bounces back and forth constantly. Ping is the number 1 complaint plastered all over their Facebook page
---
The killer isn't scummy, you're all just potato
---
This just happened in my last match.
---
‚ÄúThe already huge advantages SWF gets‚Äù
---
Again, the advantages you‚Äôre referring to are the use of comms, not inherently just SWF on it‚Äôs own.  A 4 man SWF with no comms is not the same thing as all SWFs. Communication via headset is what throws off the balance, not just SWF.  Or you could you know, just regurgitate the killer main mentality that SWF breaks the game without actually pointing out its really just the ability to communicate that does that.  Which brings me back to my original point that just bc someone is running OoO doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre SWF.  You‚Äôre ‚ÄúI need to assume someone who is running OoO is also in a SWF with comms‚Äù mentality is flawed.  Tunneling makes the game not fun for survivors, especially if all the player did was use a perk given to him by the game, just for a salty killer to assume he‚Äôs gonna be toxic and/or is on comms, you‚Äôre assumption isn‚Äôt always going to be correct and does more harm than good.  Whatever happened to playing a game and understanding the mechanics and getting good?  Regardless of how ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù they may or may not be.
---
Agreed. Hell if a killer DCs and a survivor had their 3 base perks they get the achievement.
---
Ah, but is it? It isn‚Äôt like he dies- Ghostface goes to him but gets distracted.
---
My point is more that the entire thing is a psychological loop. As killer, I get punished for trying to go around safe pallets rather than breaking them most of the time. Because of this, without being told so beforehand, I can reason out that if the situation looks similar to other safe pallets, I should break it rather than try to play the loop with the pallet down. I'm not saying killers should try to tunnel down every unhook they can, but nobody is owed any freebies in the multiplayer video game
---
Then why not just que up for the next match and forget about it? The whole match probably took about 5 min. max. I know you are a killer main from your flair, but the rest of the survivors probably earn more than the killer if they play stealthily and avoid the killer as best as they could, you know, like smart players when they realise that they will get facecamped. Camping is necessary on occation when you are getting swarmed to defend your pray, but camping for no reason is and will be punished by smart players, which is why you probably dony know how to punish camping yourself, since you whine about it so much according to the rest of your comments in this thread.
---
I asked what the difference is and how it's material. It's like if I asked for an apple, and you handed me a Fuji apple, and I yelled at you "I didn't ask for a Fuji apple, I asked for an apple! A Fuji apple is a breed created in Japan in the 1960s!"
---
Well then the survivor is just wise giving time for the others to leave
---
And they whine about as much.
---
Yeah I can't make a lobby as Killer either
---
Don't think so.
---
Wow so funny
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue. Can‚Äôt find a lobby for either killer or survivor at all
---
yeah at that point you're just giving the killer free disconnect points and also forfeiting all your own points
---
Using flashlights = toxic
---
I play his game only to be killer because I hate survivor so you can see how livid I am
---
If the pallet keeps you from getting injured then it's not a waste. Had OP not gotten stunned the chase would have likely been even shorter
---
I dont tea bag, but I'll sit and wait to give the killer an hit and I can get an escape, soooooo everyone benefits.
---
Correction, I do tea bag but only when the killer stands at the gate and stares like it's some level of arcane concept to hit me.
---
Otherwise, nah, I wait patiently for the hit. Lol
---
I‚Äôve never seen that happen and I‚Äôve been playing for awhile. Gens do go by pretty fast even with ruin. I play both sides and I‚Äôm not one sided but survivors have complete control over the game because we only have 3 good killers for red ranks. A lot of killers get nerfed because survivors don‚Äôt know how to play against them so they are ‚ÄúOP‚Äù. As a survivor main I run aura perks to help my team see what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm still a high rank as survivor but it‚Äôs because the new people don‚Äôt have a lot of game knowledge so you just have to slowly move up one pip at a time.
---
Maybe you shouldn't be so bad at the game
---
Had a team use 3 bloody party streamers. Killer was freddy,and he ended up AFK'ing,then after we did all 5 gens he instantly opened the gate forcing us all out.
---
Bad b8
---
Oh, really?
---
I didn't think it was super funny, but thank you! &lt;3
---
This is part of the exact attitude I‚Äôm talking about. You‚Äôre adding nothing valuable to the discussion.
---
It's on there teammate to help stop tunneling, if all I see is you I'm going for you but as a survivor if I'm unhooking you and the killer is coming at us I run at him to distract and bring the attention to me.  Now if you bypass me and don't try and hit me then you're super tunneling at that sucks lol
---
From a survivor standpoint, I just don't like it when survivors use pallets to lengthen chases like that. It's kinda selfish because another survivor could come along, not realizing that pallet is gone and it could potentially be life-or-death for that survivor
---
HEX: Haunted Grounds
---
I am a little divided cause on one hand when I play killer I see this a lot, but I tend to go for the person who was farming. But from my exp as a survivor it's usually some random who rescues me only for me to get smacked in the face and rehooked. Now if they were just being trolls then that's another thing, and not scummy for the killer
---
A petition will sure do something!
---
Don't bring items into a game if you're not prepared to lose them. One way or another.
---
Not necessarily but its in the toxic player toolbox for sure. Got a better suggestion for an item that is commonly  associated with toxic players that can fit in a skeletons hand?
---
Huntress is bunny mommy so like
---
You've ignored all the salient points made to you. Im a survivor main. When i get tunneled or camped, hey man, that's just how the game goes. It's frustrating, but i don't use that frustration to justify feeling like a victim on the internet. 
---
It's a scary movie video game. Somebody's gonna die. If it's you every time, maybe stick to playing killer.
---
I agree. It‚Äôs a stupid and childish mentality. It‚Äôs just a game. You‚Äôre not supposed to win every time, and sometimes, other people will be better than you. Does that mean you should tell them to kill theirself or uninstall or whatever? Absolutely not. You can learn from them, to do better.
---
I‚Äôm saving this to send to people when they attack me post game.
---
What I just do too. I mean if it boosts their ego, good for em? I just dont think about it too much. xD
---
You're simultaneously claiming:
---
1. The killer wasn't camping because he left.
---
2. This person was hook rushing because the killer hadn't left.
---
Pick a lane. Should we consider the killer "still there" or not?
---
Well to your question, i kinda just explained why its a dick move. And i dont know how she played during the game, maybe you had your reasons thinking she didnt mean to give you points. But all im saying is that tombstoning someone that wants to give you points is a dick move, thats all. If she didnt mean to, okay. If she meant to, not cool.
---
I remember he made another account and got banned within like two weeks and then he begged Mcote on his personal weekend stream to be unbanned in a Twitch donation and Mcote basically fucking laughed in his face
---
When you complete an action, your character stands up (and activates possible traps). But you can keep the Crouch button pressed to stay crouched.
---
Had this happen to me yesterday. Saw I was playing against a Freddy so kinda gave up and teabagged to let him kill me but instead he was really nice and let me fix up generators and stun him before letting us escape
---
You're being way too sensitive over people on the internet lol. If someone tells me "kys" I just ignore it and move on, people who say shit like that are miserable in their own lifes. There's nothing you can do to stop toxicity and make the community all rainbows &amp; cookies. Never gonna happen unless you're playing my little pony.
---
So one side is a team of 4... But it's *not* a team game...?
---
If you don't like playing as a team, don't play survivor. Yes, there will be bad randoms if you're joining matches but that's just like every team game ever.
---
The issue with swf isn't that it's all good players, it's that the level of communication entirely changes the pace of the game. Especially since normal survivors don't even have text chat.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you felt it necessary to make a sarcastic comment on a serious, genuine post. Not sure what you gain. 
---
The truth is, this community is full of problems, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. You can either keep contributing to those problems or make it better. In the end, it‚Äôs your choice what you want to do, but it seems no one was willing to say something about it. All I see in this reddit is negativity from one side toward the other, and there‚Äôs no reason for it.
---
Dummy thicc
---
There is a difference, an add on is single use. Voice coms, immersive outfits, and second chance perks aren‚Äôt.
---
What's your definition of camping
---
Wait, the movie that came out 1996? Oh well, how thoughtful of OP
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think the majority agrees that patrolling and camping are different. Only salty Survivors call patrolling "camping." I'm no expert on the community, by any means, though.
---
And when did you make this discovery sherlock?
---
I was talking about devotion level  it‚Äôs just for show like your rank level
---
She is also dommy mommy
---
Or you can disconnect when you get downed
---
Oh nice, someone posting a screenshot of Noobs video he just uploaded trying to get karma.  How creative üëåüèª
---
People getting mad at gen rushing kind of confuses me people always say do objective but then there‚Äôs a problem with them doing it lol I get gen rushed sometimes and it honestly doesn‚Äôt really piss me off because the survivors are just doing their objective lol I mainly just think about how quick the game ended
---
You have a point but OP didn't say they've only been playing for 4 days, that was another poster in this thread. But they did say they main survivor so it's entirely possible they've banked points/bought those teachables on the shrine and leveled them before playing killer. I know I've done it with killers before I'm uncomfortable with.
---
Even as Huntress ? It's a big map for ger 110% speed and there are a lot of rocks loops she can't throw over.
---
Played 3 games last night, had disconnects in em all before I said fuck it and switched games, dbd is doing great lol
---
Okay but we're not talking about whiny killers are we?
---
I mean I don't think it's really creative, but if you think so! &lt;3
---
Since we're getting licensed killers again, I thought that I'd love to see this badass in the game. Just like Ghostface is a sort of Myers/Pig hybrid, the Keeper would play like a mix of Trapper and Hag, waiting for survivors to fall into his traps, and then quickly traveling over to them using his safes. Sebastian or Kidman could be the associated survivor for the chapter, too.
---
Save it for the contest winning cosmetics.
---
Awww, you're back!  So happy another devout is with us
---
You really just like being obnoxious don‚Äôt you?
---
Bro if you go back down in the basement while someone is hooked down there it's literally proxy camping
---
...
---
Maybe.
---
Other weekend I smacked a person who was generally BMing me (pallet t-Bag, flashlight clicking, etc) and ended up hooked them in front of the gate. Two people leave, one person stays behind and starts circling the hook, so i chase after them for a solid minute or so. They get unhooked, Borrowed Time, T-Bag, Dead Hard, out the gate.
---
Them: *typical trash talk, git gud, u suck, etc. Guy was using all the meta perks*
---
Me: what's with the BM?
---
Them: the camping
---
Because I guess when the gates are open and there is one last person circling the hook, I'm supposed to just leave and let them get the free unhook.
---
I would say the people who get so upset over a video game that they feel the need to attack others are the sensitive ones. There‚Äôs not much one person can do, but we can all work to make it different. It‚Äôll never be a perfect community because there will always be negative people who feed off the negativity, but that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone has to follow suit. What does anyone gain by sending a shitty message? Absolutely nothing, so you might as well have not sent it at all. That gets a similar effect, only you don‚Äôt make yourself look like an ass in the process. Like i said in another comment, you, in the end, will do what you want to do, but that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else wants to. I know that not everyone will want to settle down and stop being childish, but there are people who do want the community to chill out. It‚Äôs just a video game, and some people take it so seriously for no reason at all. Most of us spent money on it, and everyone wants to enjoy playing it. We shouldn‚Äôt have to be attacked for whatever side we choose to play or how we choose to play it since it‚Äôs just a game.
---
OP scared the shit out of me, not gunna lie
---
Its just cal arts style 
---
that's why it looks the same as like everything
---
If the contest winners aren‚Äôt shirtless Myers then are they really winners?
---
I had like 6 games in a row where either the killer stood there and camped or the first one to go down disconnected or he found me in the first 15 seconds and I died on hook.
---
I really should've specified that it wasn't me doing this.
---
I‚Äôve tried it many times before and got no response and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do it anymore.
---
Exactly lmao
---
Why would they be mad? Best way to counter hag tbh, get all of her traps out of the way. Especially if you know she's on the other side of the map and can't teleport
---
I just assume it's considered camping because I patrol around an always get called a camper. I get being mad if someone just sits in front in front of the survivor but patrolling the area I don't get being called a camper for that
---
This one has the tits of a pornstar and is standing on a peanut butter cup
---
&gt; It's like if I asked for an apple, and you handed me a Fuji apple, and I yelled at you
---
Yes, you're right it is like that.
---
You asked for something, then when someone gave you what you asked for you got pissy
---
Pink key?
---
Almost every killer has addons that make them borderline op it‚Äôs nothing new
---
Just like I said, I didn't know that she wanted to give me points and could not guarantee. If I knew, I would have not done it.
---
I had nothing to contribute to this conversation, if i'm being honest
---
Someone else actually acknowledges this loop we‚Äôve been in
---
Terrible
---
That‚Äôs what I always say.  But to them it‚Äôs just ‚Äúaw shit here we go again‚Äù while watching me run around with reckless abandon
---
I guess not but the contest rules say no licensed killers. Also the devs removed the shirtless myers one already that had been submitted.
---
&gt;Whatever happened to playing a game and understanding the mechanics and getting good? Regardless of how ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù they may or may not be.
---
you can play the game and still want it to be more balanced, you know.  a balanced game is a healthier game.  you're doing a *lot* of projecting here, resorting to personal insults fairly quickly
---
as long as the option to use comms is there, people will use it, and that's always going to be the case with SWF.  SWF should be an opt-in experience from both sides, not just the survivors'
---
I'm just repeating what people have told me before for that one
---
Someone watched Noob3's stream yesterday?  xD
---
Nothing, because using items in the game doesn't make you toxic lmao
---
So you think survivors shouldn't use pallets to extend chases... so that a different survivor can use it to extend a chase.
---
That is a good looking Reese.
---
I shall test this person myself. It is personal.
---
Killers literally can literally depip if they facecamp someone. It is impossible for a survivor to depip. Stop whining
---
This happened to me when I was playing legion, I think it only happens on the swamp
---
I‚Äôll never understand those complaints it‚Äôs the survivors objective
---
Everyone plays killer because of the 2x BP event. I've had no problems as survivor and the queues for killer are relatively fast in the evening.
---
the eye of the storm is the safest place to be at sea
---
That's definitely not camping, that's just logic lol
---
That's.. kind of what the game is in a nutshell.
---
A petition won't change anything dude. If you don't like it, turn off endgame chat.
---
Yea, maybe most rare op add ons like prayer beads, but killers drown in green, purple add ons. With BBQ you get shit ton of more bps than survivors. And medkits, toolboxes are also single use items usually. It's rare you survive 3-4 games in a row. And you have to play 3-4 games as survivor to complete one bloodweb, where killer usually good with only 2.
---
And all second chance perks will be gone by tommorow. Insta heals, commodius toolboxes are also super rare on bloodwebs, you use one, you gonna need to spend around 200000 bloodpoints to get another, or play around 8-10 games, to use one in a game. It's around the same as killers rarest add ons.
---
just imagine if you killed him.
---
If 4 survivors are up when the last gen is done and 3 or more end up dying, it is cheap ya gotta admit. But it is part of the game so it goes both ways
---
"Don't worry, NoED isn't real, it can't hurt you."
---

Iron skin would literally be the worst perk to ever exist lol, and hamstring is a little too strong

Hopefully, I'm counting down the hours
---
Connection stability is one of those hugely complex web of interconnections, so with the info you have there‚Äôs no telling what is going down. The best advice is just to see if there‚Äôs anything you can see and change on your end and hope the  best. If it‚Äôs an on going thing today, but not normally, check your router, reset the router, and check if anyone on your internet is downloading a just crap ton of data. 
---
Otherwise, you just having some bad luck today, and my Fs go out to you. 
---
Yes. The way the devs designed it the survivors have little to no means of communication, no real way of planning, little way of knowing what their teammates are doing without dedicating perks to it, and little incentive to actually help each other. What little incentive there is comes from the idea that not helping your teammates increases your chances of losing, but there is no actual direct downside to not helping and little to no direct upside to helping. When you actually step back and look at how the game functions, it's overly simplistic at best and outright incorrect to call it a team game.
---
Further, your opponent doesn't have that problem. The killer is exactly as good or bad as the player. In other team games while you can get screwed over with bad teammates, so can your opponents.
---
&gt; Then why not just que up for the next match and forget about it? The whole match probably took about 5 min. max.
---
Because queuing and loading into a game cumulatively takes 10‚Äì15 minutes, and is not any fun at all, so when the game is also not any fun at all, it's like, cool, my entire day's worth of gaming has been ruined for no reason.
---
&gt; Camping is necessary on occation when you are getting swarmed to defend your pray
---
Sure, I don't even consider that camping. If you're going after an unhooked survivor, that's just chasing. Camping is waiting by the hook so that you force people to choose between letting you ruin this person's game uncontested or probably getting downed themselves.
---
&gt; camping for no reason is and will be punished by smart players, which is why you probably dony know how to punish camping yourself, since you whine about it so much according to the rest of your comments in this thread.
---
I do know how to punish camping. I don't hook rush when I play survivor. I just do gens until I see somebody else get damaged. But punishing isn't countering. They hooked person still has their game ruined. I don't know why everybody assumes I hook rush. I just think camping is bad sportsmanship, that's all.
---
As /u/ThGreen said, the kill shack pallet. It's referred to as the God pallet because there is no way to get the survivor once they drop it. The routes around the pallet are too long, and the  survivors can vault over it too fast. If you play optimally as survivor you can loop a killer there until the sun burns out if they refuse to break it. Most killers will know this and break that pallet immediately. It's considered to be the strongest pallet in the game.
---
Yeah prestiging is really just for the bloody cosmetics and the uh, **prestigue** of showing off you did it. The bloodwebs arent noticeably affected.
---
I'm just saying it's a waste of a pallet. She only used that pallet to get a stun so she could teabag
---
Or you can ignore the question.
---
So what do you want the killer to do?
---
Go to the gen on the other side of the map?
---
Or patrol the gens around the hooked person because you know someone is going to try to come back for them
---
I love getting this sort of thing after my games, it's like they're totally unaware that they're the ones who look like fools.
---
I just like to pretend they are directing that towards their fellow survivors since they are basically camping the hook themselves
---
still a baby, he's not holding m2 :(
---
He was referencing r/PrequelMemes joke. Not a. Actual question lol
---
I don‚Äôt play on PC, but that‚Äôs besides the point. Talking about the issue and having people come out and say they‚Äôre willing to change is a move forward. If you don‚Äôt want to do that, then why even bother commenting? There are people in the community who want to change they negativity and the ‚Äúthem vs us‚Äù mentality, and there are people who don‚Äôt care. No one said you were forced to do anything or that you even had to respond to this post. You could have just as easily have ignored, instead of raining on people just trying to improve the attitude in the community.

Damn dude I thought I could get away with not using a /s. Read my flair, buddy

The fact that you are on of the few people that acknowledge Pig to be the best/one of the best looking characters in this game makes me feel bad for only upvotting once.
---
I wouldn't mind Hag so much if every Hag I've ever ran into wasn't leeching off McDonald's wifi.
---
Lmao imagine printing out noed
---
To be fair you made no mistakes you wrote this out pretty well for someone who‚Äôs native language isn‚Äôt English
---
You're supposed to make bad plays on purpose to give survivors an easier game.
---
Stop giving free kills to face campers then.
---
I play mainly ps4 but on the weekends I play on xbox.  I don‚Äôy mind playing with you every now and then at all and no I will not be blocking or declining you.
---
I highly recommend you try hag. She is a monster once you learn her and she is a lot of fun imo
---
How dare they press ctrl on their keyboard üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ my life and my swf group is absolutely destroyed! üò´ i can never be seen with them ever again after they crouched in game!!!
---
YEAH FUCK YOU u/Dirtydan1431 IS A WORTHLESS FAGGOT IF I EVER MEET YOU IN PERSON I WILL FUCKING END YOU I HOPE YOUR PARENTS GET DROWNED TO DEATH
---
You on PC because I did this today.
---
1. Oh no, a depip in a game where rank means so little they automatically change everyone's rank every few weeks.
---
  Pips are meaningless. Only blood points matter, and they get plenty for facecamping.
---
2. It is absolutely possible for a survivor to depip. It happens to me basically every time I get facecamped.
---
Oh for sure. It always makes me laugh especially when gavin is killer.
---
Sending this meme to every hate mail I receive now
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get my friend who is a point addict to understand this. They‚Äôre a better killer than the killer during these events. 
---
We‚Äôre having an intervention next week with her and compiling all the farms off of us she‚Äôs gotten.
---
Then the killer crys gen rush when not everyone is trying to save from the hook. There really is no winning.
---
And you could have not made this useless petition. Yet, here we are....

If you don't want to play an asymmetric game, don't play an asymmetric game. Your argument falls flat because you're making out the very nature of the kind of game it is makes it unfair. And you have no inventive in any other game to work with the team... Except winning? Like the way literally every team game rewards you for cooperation.
---
Yeah Iron Skin should be like 10% per token lol. Hamstring seems fine though as long as it's the same slow as like huntress add-ons.
---
Not a good idea for insidious bubba.

I play mainly on ps4 but on weekends i play on my bf‚Äôs xbox so I don‚Äôt mind playing with you every now and then! And no I will not be blocking or declining you. Idk why people keep doing that if you‚Äôre over 18 that‚Äôs usually the only time I really see people refusing on lgf.

Dude, why are you being like this? I asked what the material difference between two things is. Repeatedly defining one of the things doesn't answer that question.

---
I have finally gotten all the killers

Oh I know. Just dreaming...

I wasn‚Äôt talking about viability, not everything has to be an s tier option my guy. I guess that‚Äôs what I get for proposing a fun idea.

She‚Äôs currently one of only two characters I have at P3 with all perks (she‚Äôs getting close anyway) so I might be a little biased.

this is a lot to take in

More like 20% per token, because otherwise why would it be a hex perk if it‚Äôs so weak lol.
---
Everyone : omg tbag is so toxic
---
Everyone the game after saying that : casually tbags
---
Everyone tbags once in a while, or at least did it once
---
Judging by your replies you really do not understand how the other side feels and you are missing the issues. I‚Äôd advise you to play some games as a killer against competent SWF players and see why people are so willing to dodge them. The game is not balanced around voice chat and SWF squads using it destroys the entire design of the game. You will see that when you play against some.
---
I haven't actualy heard pigs yet :c
---
Wow, expect to get banned
---
Pretty sure hate posting or witch hunting is against the rules
---
? That‚Äôs a little excessive to blatantly post someones info like that. What did they do?

"Salient points"? I asked a direct question and, in lieu of answering, you called me "trolling," "illiterate" and "a whiner." Just like everyone else. Nobody is making salient points because nobody is willing to engage in an actual conversation.

The game is an absolute blast when it reaches its full potential. There are many things that prevent the game from reaching its full potential. Killers camping and tunneling early game is the biggest example of how killers prevent this game from reaching its full potential, so I call it out.
---
The fact that there isn't even a good reason for killers to do it other than wanting to make someone else feel shitty just reinforces that it's something killers should stop doing, otherwise they are behaving like assholes.

It‚Äôs exactly what you said, too many people play killers during bloodhunt, so killers queue is longer.  How is this related to the thing you said?

I would upvote.. but it has urban evasion and noed Kappa

Staying in a range where it is impossible for somebody to unhook somebody else safely.
---
A man can dream. They would probably make a lot of money if they made that like a 1080 auric cell skin

I‚Äôm assuming you thought my use of the word salty was a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù insult?  I was referring to the comment I initially responded to, which wasn‚Äôt yourself, where the guy said ‚ÄúI tunnel anyone who brings OoO‚Äù.  Talk about projection, yeesh.  And yeah I‚Äôm all for balancing the game, just tired of the whole ‚ÄúSWF breaks the game to the point where all Survivors have the advantage all the time and us killers have absolutely no tricks in our arsenal‚Äù argument.  It‚Äôs boring and laughable.  I play 2 / 3 / 4 SWF groups as well as solo, and my escape/death ratio isn‚Äôt affected much by who I‚Äôm playing with.  A good killer is a good killer, and a good killer isn‚Äôt crying about how unfair SWF is all the time.  Thanks for the exchange man, enjoy your day :)

Killer queue takes forever even when there's no bloodhunt.  Because surviving isn't fun and there is not a proper 4:1 ratio.  What is so hard about this concept?

Nothing against you, just that this is the most repeated suggestion on this sub: people constantly suggest Behavior add a killer who can disguise themselves as a survivor, even though that power can‚Äôt possibly be effective in thus game without some serious changes to how it‚Äôs implemented

---
&gt; There isn't even a good reason for killers to do it other than wanting to make someone else feel shitty
---
Y'mean like winning the match? How about you play the game without using pallets or loops because they make the killer feel shitty? How about you don't use flashlights?
---
Do you see how stupid that is? It's not the killer's job to make sure that your teammates aren't shit. It's their job to use the weaknesses of those teammates to win.
---
This is why i am sitting on a stack of 20+ bps.  I refuse to give useless teammates and toxic killers more bloodpoints.
---
Better than actually having to play vs freddy :P
---
Not really, if you don‚Äôt provoke the killer, the killer may make a smart decision like breaking the chase to pressure gens. Thin-skinned Killers are normally easy wins for survivors.
---
They didn't say they were a killer, so calling them out for wanting survivors to suivide to them is a bit presumptuous. Also, EGC starting sooner with a longer timer doesn't make anything more or less killer favored. If survivors complete gens, it means they are winning the game. Starting the EGC to make them leave doesn't make them die any easier. And I like this change because the EGC was added to force survivors to stop holding a killer hostage. Right now, they can still do that by just not opening the gates and instead 99ing them. This would solve that problem because people wouldhave to avoid winning as survivor to hold the game hostage.
---
Dude who gives a shit. It‚Äôs a fucking post people debated. He‚Äôs entitled to his opinion, you‚Äôre entitled to think it‚Äôs wrong. No need for this.
---
I DON'T. For crying out loud, I have said like a million times in this thread that I usually ignore hooks and just do gens because I assume the killer is camping. That is also a bad solution, though, because the person they're camping still has their game ruined.
---
So he lists his opinions and you wish death on him and hus family, wow thats fucked up man
---
I play both killer and survivor and I hate when survivors pull this crap
---
Not really, no... She's more like a feral adult who was a feral child. According to her lore, there's nothing abnormal with her cognition or anything. She just doesn't know anything about how to be a normal human being because she wasn't taught anything about society/ethics/morals/laws/conduct, etc.
---
There was actually no good point in what have been replied. 
---
If the survivors don't get enough time to safely unhook someone, it's the definition of camping for this precise game. We aren't in CS you don't need to stand still to camp. 
---
You camp the objective 'cause you stay in a certain radius that allow you to constantly defend it. That's it. Depending the killer you play this distance is more or less long.
---
If I crouch up to someone and save them and they set off the trap, I'm letting them die on hook after at least attempting to soak a hit. Cucking my WGLF stack is an unforgivable sin
---
The lock is part of her power, if they removed it, she would be nerfed
---
I feel the need to say something here regarding the whole "but muh 50 extra bloodpoints tho!" thing. You get 400 for escaping a chase. If there are other survivors there, then you get boldness, chase, escape, protection, distraction. You can easily net 1000 points from that.  
---
The tea-bagging is unnecessary.
---
Just wandering around, her shirt pulled up over her head? Sigh.
---
yikes, do you take everything this seriously?
---
Im not sure if you have played killers before when theres no bloodhunt, but no, killers queues arent that long when theres no bloodhunt.
---
Enduring no longer affects head on and ds. Only affects pallets. Pallet stun reduction will be 1 second instead of 1.17 seconds
---
You might want to ask one of the community managers on the official forums. They help people with authentic cosplays, so they might be able to help with this too.
---
What is NOED? New player
---
On the Asylum map with the Carnival area, I love hiding behind the little cut-out photo board that‚Äôs perfectly modeled to fit standing or crouching survivors‚Äô faces. 
---
Honestly, it only works 50/50 compared to other places but it makes me giggle every time so I don‚Äôt care. One time a teammate and I both hid there and weren‚Äôt found and I‚Äôve never bonded with a stranger and teabagged so excitedly in my life. XD
---
With the way survivors act, this is literally Poe's Law
---
But that‚Äôs tahhhhxic
---
So, just to be clear, you want camping to be a bannable offense?
---
Urban evasion doesn't cause survivors to waste time being crouched in a corner, survivors who crouch in the corner are just attracted to urban evasion
---
Classic leatherface.
---
No worries
---
Lmao thats a good spot
---
Because "walked off to search for people" is camping.
---
There's a reason you got downvoted, as you aparently ignored their post, as they tried to walk away multiple times, but kept being brought back by finding someones scratch marks as they sprinted to the basement blindly.
---
Yeah as I just said flashlight isn't necessarily toxic but I asked for items associated with toxic players. I did not say "what items are toxic then?". Let's try harder to read next time.
---
Lol i just played you
---
Hex: no one escapes death.
---
When the final generator is completed a random dull totem is lit and all survivors are given the exposed status until the totem is cleansed. Doesn't trigger if all dull totems are broken.
---
Sure, he said a lot of dumb shit, but he didn't incite violence on an individual or their family. Don't tell people to burn in hell just 'cause you disagree with them over a video game, get over yourself.
---
Right now, survivors who still want to hold the game hostage, are able to. They 99% the gates and go about it as if there was no EGC. I like this idea as it would force surivivors to stop doing tjeir objectives to hold the game hostage. Not doing the objective = not earning points so if they hold the game hostage, neither side is winning. Right now, they complete every gen for objective points, then dick around with closed gates. This gets players like me, who are running distraction, killed as the gates are left unopened by the ones trying to waste killers' time.
---
I'm a killer main tho
---
Or take away blood points for proximity the same way you take away rank. If they came out of the match with fewer points than the person they camped, I'd feel more OK with it.
---
Here's the thing. Survivors should know the killer by that point. So survivors should know it takes a certain amount of time before a COMFORTABLE distance is made based on how fast that killer is. You can do that without looking up the exact MS too, just by playing the game enough. And even if you don't know the killer, there are only two base speeds that really exist commonly (bar early game/perma tier 1 Myers or...a walking nurse) If an extremely small amount of time went by, that 98% of the time means the killer is still VERY close (bar nurse blinking or Billy sawing away). 
---
So if you know the killer is very close by and you still make a bold, risky, and stupid play, the killer isn't camping. This is because he/she is responding to evidence pointing to survivors still being there and reacting accordingly. ESPECIALLY when the intent of the killer is to leave.
---
But if you insist that's still camping, then it is AT LEAST camping forced by the survivor. You can't complain about camping if you provide the only conditions that make camping the best play, because it's almost always suboptimal if the survivors know what to do. Punishing misplays is not toxic in a competitive game. TAUNTING is.
---
From what I‚Äôve watched pc players are just as shocking, if monto or noobs videos are anything to go by.
---
This post was written by a survivor main
---
People are more mad at the developer‚Äôs for having them in the game at all.
---
did you know that if you sneak over the traps they won't go off?
---
Of course!  Id much rather we become the best of friends, you can be my Watson üíú
---
Not if you hang around rank 10.  Anything higher and lower is a pretty long wait.
---
I am fine with her playstyle really, though it is hard being a survivor with her if you didn't bring a flashlight. What I fuckin hate with all my fucking heart  is the sudden noise and yelling when one of her traps go off. God fucking fuck I hate that
---
I just read it and I'm rly confused now. 
---
It says it's reducing the duration of pallet stuns by 50%, but what I'm confused on is why is the new stun duration displayed as theoretically lasting longer (50% cut instead of a 75% cut) if it actually doesn't last as long.
---
But unless the killer sucks, they are going to win no matter what.
---
Are you saying you suck as killer? Honestly I'm starting to just assume that this sub is full of shit killers, because otherwise you guys wouldn't bend over backwards to defend tunneling rank 15s.
---
If you aren't hot garbage, then no, tunneling is not needed to win. Therefore the only reason to do it is to be an asshole.
---
But I can‚Äôt think of what those changes could possibly be. I‚Äôm sure there must be some good way to implement this type of power, but I‚Äôve never seen a good suggestion for it before, and can‚Äôt even imagine what a good way to do it would look like.
---
Right off the bat, ‚ÄúCan turn into a survivor to try to trick people‚Äù will virtually never work because of SFW (not to mention that if this is his only power, it just sounds like a worse Wraith). So from the very beginning their power needs to revolve around something else.
---
no one fear you as a killer kid‚Ä¶ it's just a game. Everyone just try to get his fun from a match, that's it.
---
U didn't understand, all of them using urban evasion, hardly the traps gonna be activated.
---
üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
---
This is truth.
---
Not really. Hostage taking survivors just waste 2 minutes of time instead of all of the killer's time. Or, and this is getting way more common for some reason, survivors 99% the gates and then hold the killer hostage like normal. Having to open the  gates helps the killer end this but it still gives survivors too big a window to dick around. Starting the EGC at gen completion would force survivors to sacrifice objective points in favor of hostage taking.
---
That... That second part is literally what they did... They went away, found scratches and followed them back to the hook.
---
Posting someone's gamertag or anything like that is also against the dbd reddit rules, so that's reportable on here. You have to censor usernames and such.
---
I've honestly never seen a killer start being toxic first. It's usually the survivors that start some shit in chat and only *then* do the killers be toxic back.
---
All of this is already in the sub rules
---
Your statement still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me
---
As a killer? Hmmm
---
Hey /u/chattywindow are you submitting something for the ‚Äòdesign your own cosmetic‚Äô contest? I always loved your stuff
---
Seriously, we don't care about the extra points for hitting survivors, we just want them to leave.
---
Most DC because they got downed within the first minute of the game. Some when they're getting moired. Or they get a map that they hate, ie corn-vision
---
Man you need help good lord  you must be a joy to live with
---
Hmm, I have yet to experience this on either side, killer or survivor. Feels like such a small amount of occurrences, not to mention the killer can open the gates at any time to activate the end game collapse, as well as find and close the hatch.
---
I still feel like it's perfect in its current state, given those options to end the game on either side, by either option.
---
upvoted for jpeg artifacts
---
Except the game is pretty balanced. If you're always loosing against any half decent killer then you're throwing stones from a glass house.
---
But you're right. Not taking the easiest option to beat my opponent makes me an asshole. You're hilarious. At this point you're either trolling or dumb so I'm just going to ignore you from here on out.
---
People who do shit like this may not be garbage at the game, but as a person they are garbage themselves.
---
"B-but urban evasion take's control of your brain and makes you crouch in the corner y-you can't use it to complete gens!!!11 y-you can't put gen pressure on the killer with a singular perk in your loadout!!!!!!!1"
---
I‚Äôm aware of that. However some people continue to do this anyway or don‚Äôt care read the rules.
---
It's meant when you're playing as a killer. I'm not the best meme maker. I make a lot mistakes when I make one.
---
It‚Äôs not pedophilia if the body‚Äôs over 18
---
They won‚Äôt address it until dedicated servers come out. Your best bet is to get out of the turd bracket (11-15) since DCers don‚Äôt pip and keep themselves with the other turds.
---
Rank 6-8 are really fun for me.
---
Freddy is getting a rework
---
My goodness, someone needs to step outside and get some fresh air and remember that it's a video game lmao
---
I love that axe, but I feel like the rest of the outfit does not fit the theme of The Huntress.
---
Freddy is already being reworked, almost completely changed from what I've seen.
---
As for the others, why are they not allowed to be fast or see auras in certain situations? I don't see the issue.
---
I think you may have misread. They said they went to check a gen, then checked the building again and saw scratch marks *there*. They didn't go away and find scratch marks leading back. They checked a gen (which was apparently very close since they could go there and come back in less time than it takes someone to unhook), then turned around and went back. And for the last person, they didn't even describe leaving.
---
You do realize that without that speed boost, wraith would get like, no kills? He already gets looped to shreds lmao. He needs it to compensate for her slow reappearance time.
---
They‚Äôre also changing Freddy, so be patient little one
---
They really do
---
i don't think the player base deserve that given the most popular post of this thread.
---
That‚Äôs why we play her. She‚Äôs pretty fun to play as she‚Äôs very tactical and requires more map knowledge plus gives insane map control, but I agree facing her is pretty difficult if you‚Äôre against a good hag who locked an area of the map.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine how hard you rage in game if this is your reaction to a reddit post. Yikes.
---
Michael and Michael ship or else
---
Thanks for the reply, dude! Cheers!
---
Yeah I get more cakes than streamers most webs.
---
The material difference between the two:
---
Camping: Killer is staying near the area to ensure a sacrifice on one particular hooked survivor, a clear indication of either noobery (doesn‚Äôt understand how bad of an idea this is), daily ritual or general grieving. The material outcome of this is that no matter how long you wait, the killer is not going to leave and the match is probably over for the hooked survivor.
---
Standing close enough that nobody can possibly be rescued: the Killer has things in the area to get done before they want to leave. Huntress reloading hatchets. Hag laying traps. Kicking any gens. Investigating fresh track marks. Checking any typical hiding spots. Breaking pallets. The material outcome of this is that once the killer is done accomplishing these tasks, they will leave the area to find survivors at other objective points. Thus, if you are able to wait this out without providing any other reason for the killer to stay in the area, they will leave and you can get a safe unhook.
---
Not only is this common knowledge in the community, but the OP is clearly describing the second scenario, and no matter how hard people try to explain this to you, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting through. So I hope this helps.
---
All I did was complain about balance problems I see in the game. What the fuck man?
---
Obviously best at low ranks. The lower the rank, the dumber the survivor. Only killers like nurse and spirit really suffer from being piloted by a noob. The rest will easily win as long as the survivors are bad. What is this question?
---
Its bad enough that the survivors are slower, and on consoles, even vaulting or dropping, will have a Lag and give the hit to the killer anyway.
---
Yeah, i heard they are making him more powerful
---
"Hurr hurr, it's funny because he downed me but I still escaped."
---
Again, I did. Won some games, lost others. Ok as I see it's not going anywhere, it's like swf group killed your puppy or something, bye.
---
Makes sense. Maybe that's why I'm seeing more DCs. It's been a few months since I played so I'm all the way down in baby ranks lol.
---
Then seeing it on every level from then till you're finally forced to get it......even worse.
---
Indeed
---
He has a red stain, that's not insidious!  M2 fails~
---
A build u should try on spirit that‚Äôs pretty fun: discordance, surveillance, bbq, ruin 
---
Slows the game down, just a little bit, by giving you the location of pretty much anyone working on a gen (could swap out ruin with pop goes weasel if u hate totem perks like me)
---
I mean, I know why people DC (because they're babies who can't handle a video game lmao) I'm just wondering when the devs will do something about it. But someone else pointed out with dedicated servers and that makes sense.
---
I mostly play Spirit and Pig so I‚Äôm a bit biased. 
---
Spirit is a good choice overall. She‚Äôs high-Tier with some practice and still one of the few killers able to provide some good spooks. Her power allows her to travel the map very quickly without being seen (though she can be heard) so her map pressure is wonderful. She also has a lot of mindgame potential and is a killer that actually makes you feel good when you have success with her. Her perks are also all good to great. 
---
Pig is generally a mid-tier killer but can be beastly in the right hands. Aside from that though, I find her to be very fun to play. As you may have guessed, I love being able to spook survivors and she‚Äôs fairly good at that. Turn up the Fog, throw on some Whispers, and you‚Äôll likely get a couple gen grabs. Her reverse bear traps won‚Äôt usually net you kills but sort of act as a Ruin you have more control over, as you can slow down the game with them. Of her perks, one is pretty useless but the other 2 are quite good on killers with good map pressure (like Spirit). (:
---
Its also bot tunneling if your team runs away and your sitting behind a rock healing and i got nurses...
---
Yep. I've played for killer and survivor (surv more) and have concluded the fact that 98% of the time, survivors are the ones who swing first in chat. The only time I've seen the killer attack first was when he made a small jab at the one guy who brings DS, mettle of man, dead hard, self care and an insta heal.
---
I literally had a killer DC yesterday after the first survivor got unhooked though
---
Unless he just got there and is waiting for insidious to activate. He could also be a friendly bubba, trying to show another survivor that it‚Äôs ok to get him.
---
uhhh you just said some of the lowest tier killers in the game are too powerful for the only reasons that they have any power. I'm sorry if you're new to the game but this stuff is all very incorrect. Play a little longer, learn how to loop, and learn how to beat the killers. Learn what makes them weak and you will learn how insane this post is lol
---
Ikr, the amount of salt thin-skinned killers generate whenever they see a survivor spamming CTRL is shocking.
---
Being invisble and being faster at running. He can get plenty of kills.
---
You guys forget. That in the survivors side, even one kill is could actually be a solo player who joined in and could be skilled; but gets killed anyway.
---
Soo many players DC and being a Survivor now depends on the whole 4 players being alive.
---
That doesnt make a balanced game.
---
Spirit is full of broken glass, that's a risky shag there.
---
Also the noises
---
I mean I have little trouble winning. Ironically the empathy that leads me to not tunnel as a killer also leads me to not like seeing my newb teammate get fucked over by someone like you too.
---
And yes, when you are going to win anyways, and taking the easiest option at best makes it so one person doesn't get to play in the first place, you are an asshole.
---
True but Billy can 1 hit down to punish a mistake. Good billy's can down you in 1 hit for even the smallest mistake.
---
I mean if you are the killer and you load into a game at the same time as everyone else and you have no "finder" perks on and litterally 1 min into the game 3 gens all pop at the same time 1either your a bad killer who doesnt understand map spawns or your getting "gen rushed" I dont understand why survivors say it isnt a thing when it OBVIOUSLY is btw if 3 gens pop litterally 1-2 mins into the game im sure a killer is thinking to themselves "you know what this is bs imma dc" *opens menu* and every survivor just hears a yeet go all over the map and the screen goes black
---
There's 4 survivors to 1 killer. And each survivor has to be hit twice (or 3 times with MoM) and hooked 3 times. So, hypothetically, that's a minimum of 24 times you have to get close enough to land a hit to get a 4k. 
---
I can't imagine how bad the game would be if those survivors we're as fast as the killer. There'd be no reason to play killer at that point cause you'd never catch anyone, let alone enough to get 24 hits on them.
---
This post is EXTREMELY survivor biased.
---
I forgot about that, you're absolutely right.
---
From: 
---
Your average brand new player.
---
Yeah this has been happening a lot to me.  For someone who recently found out the god pallet exists,   People just love to use it willy nilly.
---
And can we stop downvoting for differing opinions? or is that inevitable? Sometimes i literally just say how i feel about something, receive no debate on the comment and -8 downvotes. That shit drives me mad
---
People who called them Low Teir are mainly Trolls and Greifers in real life. And also while playing.
---
I say thats a lie.
---
I probably just named the main killers that most survivors instanlty DC on.
---
And his best buddies [Netorare](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Netorare) and [Mindbreak](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mindbreak)
---
If you have a problem with wraith so much just ran Sprint Burst lmao. Makes his speed boost (for only 1 second I might add) basically worthless. 
---
And I‚Äôve had survivor‚Äôs DC on me and my friend. We still were able to all escape, so no, the game doesn‚Äôt 100% depend on all 4 survivors being alive.
---
Until you bring in Bamboozle.
---
*oh god oh fuck*
---
That does help. I guess to me, there's no indication that person was doing the second one. "I ended up getting all 4 because they kept going for anyone I hooked" seems to clearly describes a camping mindset where people shouldn't go for hooked survivors at all. He never states any intention to go away. He just says they were dumb to try for saves, full stop.
---
If I get hit with a bullshit hit and go down early, I'm out
---
Blood points is OK but ban being an option never.
---
-killer main...
---
The only truly OP killer is the nurse, maybe billy. rest is fine. Its laughtable you included wraith since hes the easiest killer in the game.
---
But, you do get less points for staying within proximity of a hooked survivor? And I don't know about you man, but I've left games with more bloodpoints than the killer before when he was facecamping. It all depends on what you do. There's been games where I leave with 2600 blood points and the killer had roughly 1300.
---
Fucking YES. I am not going to you know, take a fucking break and grab some coffee because the only way you guys get to win this game is constantly stalking the same hook together. Grow the f up
---
This. And don't play claudette if you're not prepared to get mori'd every game.
---
You can see his outline while he is moving, and the game is survivor sided still, take a look at games where skilled survivors play at low rank, you'll see them destroying killers easily with the best perks amd items possible. The only killers who has a chance at high ranks are hillbilly, nurse and spirit. And none of those are there surprisingly.
---
*Laughs in URbAN EVaSIon*
---
Just no one understand that if a killer is chasing you NO one and I mean no one,will start crouching
---
How's the taste of each other's ass? Since you two seem to love kissing the others.
---
Sometimes the most random things get downvoted like people asking questions or perk builds.
---
It goes down a tier eventually unless you have the right add ons i believe
---
You're saying it's not fun. Why not take a break, play something else maybe, and then come back to it
---
Go play the a little, maybe you will then understand what you are talking about.
---
I walk up to them backwards to prevent them from getting their points and seeing them teabag but still make them scared enough to run out
---
Yes tier 3 only lasts so long. There is an ultra rare add on that allows infinite tier 3. Michael is actually reasonably balanced and very dynamic. Do a little bit of research and you'll learn about his balance and how fun he can be to play as and play against
---
He has it on a timer when activated.
---
He gets it by stalking people.
---
When the timer runs out, he has to stalk again for awhike to do it again
---
Yea I never double tap them. They‚Äôll be on the entire other side of the map after you do. He needs another rework
---
Oi, how can you only have one member of the Legion? Is that why he's a maybe, because some are a heck yeah and some are a no thanks? lol
---
Thx man, I appreciate it!
---
I say with a little number and power tweaking this is a great concept it would be fun to see in game.
---
Yeah, just because you cant think of a alternative to the speed mechanic doesnt mean there IS NO alternative.
---
Hell, they could make it, that the Killers Reticle needs to be following the Survivor in order to gain a higher top speed, and If a survivor has the killer to lose the killer reticle focus, will cause him to lose top speed.
---
It just seems weird to invest so much bp in something you dont do alot, but it is possible if op has been playing for a while and just buying good killer perks from the shrine
---
Didnt pay attention after the game but he must've had that add on. He instadown 9 times over the 9-10 minute game and was still able to instadown me while camping the exit gate
---
The survivor team made a mistake... sucks for that one person but it's not the killer's fault they're capitalizing, it's the teams fault for giving the killer that opportunity.
---
I never play killer. From my perspective, I only complain when a killer does not leave the sacrifice even when all other potential victims are across the map. Walking 20 meters away and watching from behind a tree is strategic, but still camping.  I‚Äôve gave kudos to a spirit who camped just at the edge of her shift, then shifted in to take down a rescuer. Nice move.  But most campers are blunt; face campers.   Cheap, lack of game spirit.  Where‚Äôs the skill in that?  If you‚Äôre a sacrifice, and your killer camps, sorry. I don‚Äôt rescue, or expect to be rescued.
---
But bbq m8
---
These are literally the worst killers in the game. I never see anyone DC on the killers past rank 15. You need to get better at the game before go saying all this stupid shit.
---
He's too good at playing victim man. Just don't fight it anymore. It's not going anywhere.
---
Or the shrine for those sweet, sweet bloodpoints. (But if you have that many stones, I have no doubt you have more than enough bloodpoints lol)
---
Leather face is eh but his perks are good. I like the spirit as a killer and for her perks.
---
Spirit, hands down. 
---
Great killer. 
---
Good-Great perks. 
---
Cannibal isn‚Äôt great, you‚Äôre right. But he has arguably the best killer perk in the game, BBQ and Chili. Even if you don‚Äôt use him, having that teachable will help you keep hook momentum in a game and earn you double BP which on its own is worth the DLC price.
---
Ive gotten called toxic for this more than any other reason.
---
The killer can start the 3 minute countdown any time they want after the last gen is done. If the survivors don't leave for those 3 minutes, that's their call. Holding the game hostage is when there's no choice but to DC to draw a reasonable end to a game. There's none of that in this situation.
---
What‚Äôs unrealistic about a pizza boy
---
Impossible, BBQ never spawns on the shrine
---
if it did nobody would buy leatherface
---
I found the rank 20.
---
No thank you
---
The killer isn't somehow compelled to be an asshole. They have the choice to win like an asshole or win not like an asshole.
---
Maybe stop sucking as a killer so that you don't have to rely on toxic tactics :/
---
I'm not trying to think of an alternative because I don't see the issue. Killers should be inherently faster than the survivors as it takes work to catch them all.
---
You're getting flamed by everyone on here because none of your arguments make sense or hold water.
---
Take the hint and move on.
---
Streamers, most likely. You see it with killer streamers occasionally.
---
Seriously. You already have a lead on the killer. The other guy doesn't. Neither of you will get stun points if guy infront throws down pallet. Just be a good team-mate bro, not asking for much.
---
Nah I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Doctor for Monitor and Abuse considering how good it is on Myers.
---
Mcote said something the line of. "Well, this shoud be discussed on the forum."
---
considering that both are vastly different and not even comparable i don‚Äôt want to debate nor do i feel like debating.
---
you‚Äôre saying that there are many universes, and if that‚Äôs true or not, there‚Äôd have to be humanity in existence for mine to happen, obviously. the nature and history of us makes me feel like this was likely to happen.
---
again, apples and oranges.
---
you‚Äôre assuming that there are different universes and well, this is _MY_ universe and i‚Äôm viewing it as my canon.
---
&gt;mew
---
wtf is wrong with you
---
Because that wouldn't solve the problem at all?
---
True but i think I seen ppl test it and it‚Äôs better to be low level because you earn them faster not as much but it adds up compared to being level say 50
---
Enjoy my cat puns
---
What is that from ?

---
there's a difference between being provoking a killer for a strategic advantage and hanging around in the gates during the collapse for the sole purpose of showing off your squatting skills
---
I'd be down for that simply because I never use map offerings on survivors and only use them on killers lol. But then, it doesn't really effect me the way you said it, so my opinion doesn't really matter.
---
People here are babies then, a funny clip is a funny clip who cares who posted it
---
Yep - they really **DO** exist.
---
It sad, really. But I‚Äôm glad there some positive people playing it and they are not acting like whining children.
---
I bet Most of the Haters commenting.
---
Only play as Killers
---
And troll and Greif other Survivors as the Survivor
---
But the perk goes to a maximum of 8 tokens. 
---
80% faster break speeds and stun recovery is very strong and 160% would be absolutely broken.
---
If a killer crys genrush, they are equally stupid to survivors that make this meme a reality tbh... There is an out, though it seems like the odds are extremely stacked against us. That out being not having any stupod people in the lobby.
---
True. ***Not a lolicon btw***
---
Don‚Äôt think so, they were in the post of all the new cosmetics for the next few weeks so it could be any time before then
---
I've actually suggested that before. A mechanic where say if you hold a key or button before they unhook you, you deny them from taking you off. Like a little head shake clearly stating "not yet". Something subtle that the killer can't really pick up on unless he's close.
---
I would also have trouble spotting claudettes if my screen was that small
---
Don‚Äôt think so, they always spread out the cosmetics so it could be any time within the next few weeks
---
Main reason I bring kindred, I wanna know if I should flame killer for camping or team for farming me lol
---
Why don‚Äôt you go play him or watch a YouTube video before calling him OP? One of the most annoying people in this game do is call the other side OP when they clearly don‚Äôt know what they are talking about. 
---
MM is probably one of the most loved killers in this game by both the survivor and killer community. He‚Äôs a great killer, tons of fun add ons, and overall just fun to play and play against. You‚Äôre not gonna find much hate against MM here.
---
bud i'm devotion 3. I get a lot of 4ks as killer and i've had my fair share of 5 gen chases. I normally don't argue with people I know for a fact are incorrect but you seem willing to talk this out. Here's the facts:
---
Freddy: worst killer in the game. For a new player he's terrifying because you can't see him. Learn why he's weak and you will realize he's EXTREMELY weak. Just remember it takes SEVEN seconds to fall asleep.
---
Wraith: Fun fact, he used to not have a speed boost coming out cloak and he was literally unplayable. I would say he was worse than freddy before that. Now he's in a really good place. Very loopable but still has the ability to outplay survivors
---
Legion: Fun fact #2 legion was just completely changed because he was the most unfair killer to play against. Insane amount of exploits, he was even faster than he used to be, his add on franks mixtape made you want to kys in real life. Horrible, he's much more balanced and you actually have a chance against him now. Make him miss or stun him to knock him out of his ability, also he vaults used to be faster
---
Plague: a killer that is very controversial when it comes to power. Some say she's way too weak others say shes way too strong. If you don't cleanse, shes a regular, easy to beat M1 killer. If she has corrupt then you're fucked if she sees you. still escapable but rare. So the trick is to not let her get her power OR don't let her find you with the power
---
It's clear to me that you don't really have a great understanding of either side (let alone 1 side), and that's okay. This game is not very easy for new players. You have to grind and do a lot of learning before you fully understand the balance. If you don't know how or why things are balanced you're gonna get smashed every time
---
# SASUGA NEA-SAMA!
---
I love how shit like this happens and people are like, ‚Äúbubba meme is funny.‚Äù Then when a survivor decides to use a pallet or flashlight they go, ‚Äúfuck survivors make this game frustrating‚Äù
---
lmao
---
You: TOXIC SWF, LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT
---
Him: That‚Äôs not true, it may be difficult and you won‚Äôt always win but you should not hold a defeatist mentality and try your best..
---
You: Why so defensive.
---
I don‚Äôt know about you but playing against mindless survivors who are new to the game is boring. There‚Äôs no fun killing survivors that run in a straight line and have no awareness.
---
I enjoy the challenge and mind games provided by more skilled players. Sometimes I manage to beat them, sometimes I don‚Äôt and I take that as a learning opportunity. Change your mindset.
---
Use your brain and infer that i am saying no item is toxic. Is that too hard for you? Oh, right. It is.
---
Purple Hoodie Legion girls should be daddy myers tier!
---
Yep. The devs apparently think it's affecting so few people that it's not worth addressing. ü§∑ Even though there's a new post about it here every day.
---
A few weeks after it started happening (when they added Plague, like you said), they said they felt DCs were in a good enough place to increase the threshold on DC bans. ha.
---
Doctor coming in "*Respect the laws of gravity you philistene!*"
---
We won't see this cuz we can't read
---
Been playing three days now, they all have builds and great perks and shit. Lame rank system
---
And the latter pisses you off?
---
Yeah, the grind is a real pain, but in my opinion, at least it gives an overarching goal. Until we have some sort of reward for being rank 1, that system doesn't really matter. And as a completionist, it's satisfying to complete bloodwebs and fill out perks. 
---
But, I do know I'm never leveling up every survivor with all perks. One survivor with every perk and then some of my favorite killers with all their perks, and even then it'll take ages. I just recently got everyone to level forty (I didn't want to use the shrine for teachables, so.) Now comes the real fun of grinding to prestige three and going from there. :P
---
The killer's supposed to kill, being an asshole has nothing to do with it. You're welcome to create an arbitrary rulebook for your playstyle, but don't be upset others choose not to follow them. 
---
I've already explained how to avoid tunnelling, the game even has perks to help combat it (DS, BT). Run those &amp; be smarter about unhooks if you want to avoid it. If you get farmed by your teammates bummer dude, move on to the next game and hope the situation is better. Shit happens.
---
I'm not saying it's unrealistic, I'm saying silly outfits exist in the game already.
---
Darn, tought I found my test subject.
---
I disagree with Wraith being in a good place; add-ons are a necessity for him.  
---
I completely agree with everything else, though.
---
So all of them are just gonna crouch around the whole map? So Nurse is shit too because they can do the same against her.
---
If you cared about the issue you would've done more than make a useless ass petition
---
Being biased to Pig is allowed.
---
You're right, my bad! Looking at the screen in the situation I talked about, it visually shows a disconnect icon next to the killer.
---
xd
---
Just tunnel the flashlight or take Franklin's
---
I never said for the game. I said for your attitude.
---
I still think a totem counter should be part of small game, just to give that perk a little bit more.
---
I'm going to save this so I can send it to salty survivors.
---
I offered to farm last night, as the trapper on Haddonfield. 3 party streamers used. But when I gave the signal, Nea shook her head no.
---
The killer is perfectly capable of winning without being an asshole. Therefore if they choose to be an asshole, that makes them a...wait for it....asshole.
---
You just haven't played the game enough. Watch some YouTube videos for help as survivor. Survivors have all of the power in this game and killers only punish mistakes.
---
It‚Äôs not really that silly though imo
---
Why don‚Äôt you get out of that Jabroni outfit then we can get to business
---
Rank reset just occurred
---
Get good. lol
---
Just kidding there..... Yeah, you got placed with a SWF group and probably unfairly on this one for sure.
---
BTW, love the Doctor. Might wanna look into leveling your Trapper to get Unnerving Presence - it's really good to add to Distressing and the Doctors ability.
---
I'd love an Evil Within DLC so much.
---
The Keeper has amazing potential as a Killer; and Sebastian and Kidman could both make really cool and interesting Survivors if done right.
---
So why am I playing against this rank 7
---
Okay when i say he's in a good place i mean hes in *a good enough place* lol he's better than he used to be and there's other killers that need attention before they mess with him anymore
---
The game is broken when it comes to rank, that‚Äôs all to be said :(
---
I would encourage you to try other headphones if you're interested. They're certainly higher $ but there's plenty of good gaming headphones that are super comfortable. I love my Astros (A40's for wired, A50's for wireless) and Steelseries also has super comfy headphones in a great price range. Headphones &lt;$50 are usually trash, but a good pair of SS can be found for $70 new.
---
How high a level do I got to get the trapper? (Also the notif only showed me ‚Äúget good‚Äù was soooooo mad ahaha)
---
I play as both and I can tell you the game is 100 percent harder as killer. Have you ever played killer against a group of good swf? It's fucking hard.
---
ARE YOU FUCKING STUPID I FUCKING AGREED WITH YOU ON THAT YOU DUMB PIECE OF SHIT I'M NOT FUCKING ARGUING WITH YOU! LET ME FUCKING SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU, YOU SMOOTH BRAINED TROGLODYTE. ITEMS AREN'T TOXIC BUT SOME ITEMS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TOXIC BEHAVIOR. SOME ITEMS WILL BE PREFERRED BY TOXIC PLAYERS BECAUSE THE UTILITY OF THE ITEMS ADDS GAME PLAY OPTIONS THAT WHILE USEFUL TO SURVIVING OR KILLING HAVE OTHER USES SUCH AS BEING TOXIC. DOES THAT FUCKING HELP YOU OUT?
---
LOL get gud, baby survivor.
---
No, what is the message? Leet?
---
It was there a month or two ago. Conveniently when the community was upset about legion.
---
They‚Äôre only in ‚ÄòMaybe‚Äô due to the four different characters with different levels
---
Big lame, they fucked on me hard, nice about it post game tho, they let me shock them a lot for points and stuff, huge L but profit

Full Costume - On his travels through America, Kenneth Chase briefly owned a fried chicken restaurant, as famous for its flavour as it was for its poor hygiene. The establishment found itself abandoned by Kenneth after it came under investigation as part of numerous missing person cases.
---
Head - Gluttonous Visage - A monstrously obese countenance, its mouth smeared with chicken grease.
---
Body - White Double Breasted Suit - Formerly an immaculate suit suitable for a Southern gentleman, now marred with sweat, grease and blood.
---
Weapon - Cimeter Knife - Just as good at cutting up chunks of raw chicken as it is gutting those who are curious about what goes into the recipe

You got it, Suzie is high tier for sure

Look at his post history. You'll quickly see why
---
Please don‚Äôt murder me if this has already been posted, I scrolled through new for quite awhile looking for another post and couldn‚Äôt find one.
---
Careful hes retarded.
---
Hahaha, there was a guy just slowly urban evasioning to you and watching instead of doing gens. Survivors are brain dead üòÇ
---
Been to Japan and some people just wear it out in public (its kinda rare tho)
---
Hahaha, yeah, level to 30 to get teachable perks and HOPE it is on the level 30 web.
---
If not, get the first teachable to get to 35 for the next one. Worst case, ya gotta go to 40.
---
But it's worth it on the Doctor, combined with the crazy madness skill checks, small skill checks, and a huge terror radius with Distressing. 
---
It makes things pretty crazy as Doctor.
---
Wow finally a sensible post among all the ''hurrdurr killers tunnel camp durr''
---
exactly lol i just wish i could teleport to that downvoter and have a conversation. 
---
"Is every thing okay bud? who hurt you? Why do you feel the need to do this?"
---
Also i just wanna say, i just noticed your name and it made me chuckle lol
---
Um, Mew for You. pawblem for problem
---
The one exception is Doctor. He can actually shock someone inside, vault the window and get the hit off before the survivor's scream wears off and they can vault themself.
---
DOCTOR is the most irritating shit ever created in a videogame change my mind.
---
This drops today? Thought it was tomorrow
---
Does anyone know when exactly it's likely to happen? Which time in which timezone?
---
Oh damn I knew it was fast but not THAT fast. Killer running at the speed of light ready to destroy some Survivors.
---
Im your average rank 10 forgiving if you didnt teabag because you threw a pallet killer so idk
---
*insert surprised Pikachu*
---
Source? Also Michael x Laurie is the most advanced pairing. It‚Äôs hot asf, but this is still hot.
---
It is tomorrow
---
Its always the bubba with the claudette face that be doing this
---
It would be useless. Back a few months ago when the big deal was "streamers dc'ing to derank" it was only geared towards streamers that the majority of the community didn't like. Cause when I called out the steamer everyone loves that does it constantly I got down voted to shit and NOBODY wanted to acknowledge it.
---
What is this meme actually from? I've only seen it twice but I'd love to know the source
---
Honestly though, the most fun i‚Äôve ever had in this game was just chain flashlight saving my friend and 2 randoms the whole game. I would save one, he would die, my friend would save him. Really fun, but I wouldn‚Äôt call the killer a camper lol.
---
If survivors are ignoring gens, the killer can ignore gens.
---
If survivors stay near a hook, the killer can stay near the hook.
---
The killers job is to be where the survivors are. If the killer isn't where the survivors are, the survivors can easily punish them. Survivors are in control.
---
See that‚Äôs an example of the survivor misplaying it. What I meant by respect it was it‚Äôs an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù that forces you to eventually drop the pallet because of the killers blood lust. BUT a good suburvivor won‚Äôt even drop it. He will just loop you until he would normally have to drop it and instead of going for the pallet, just jump out the window. This forces you as the killer to go through the window or go around it. He never actually dropped the pallet but still got to ‚Äúuse it‚Äù and in the even that he mistimed the loops and you actually are going to get him, then he can just actually drop it to make it safe. Again, my wording may be confusing so I apologize if it is. Does that make more sense?
---
This happened when I played the Pig once.
---
It got to the point where I simply jumped off the ledge into the corn, counted to 5 Mississippi‚Äôs, and sure enough, they already saved him.
---
They accused me of camping. I told them I didn‚Äôt camp, they just kept saving in front of me.
---
They responded with ‚Äúthen don‚Äôt camp.‚Äù
---
Bruh, WHAT?
---
Let me down you all, since you are here, and I'm here, then I will leave the area for 2 full minutes.
---
If you lead me away, that's fine too. Just don't act like I'm going to high-five the team on the way out of the area, to kick Gen's while you all heal up together.
---
Has anyone even seen a horror film where the killer isn't a fucken moron?
---
I've slowly branched to other subs and notice that it's inevitable /: i guess it's their only form of power so they fully plan to abuse it. It honestly takes a lot for me to ever downvote someone
---
Pray to the entity you get straight brain dead survivors, 25 times :p
---
Puts Huntress in the pedo zone, yet thinks Suzie (who is pretty much 16) in the yeah boi zone. Hmmm
---
Pretty sure you just have to down them after you frenzy them. I think I read that downing someone with the borrowed time timer counts too
---
Vanilla and anal only for me.
---
Have you ever played against a SWF and not camped/tunneled? That‚Äôs practically easy mode for killer if you define winning as getting 1-2 kills. More so, you get competent survivors with Borrowed Time and instaheals and even that won‚Äôt work for you. Play a weak killer like Freddy or Wraith, don‚Äôt camp/tunnel, and see how you do.
---
Yes killer is faster. 
---
Yes killer has powers.
---
They also don‚Äôt have 3 teammates to help them in their objective. 
---
One look at your account and I have to think this is a troll post. Sorry.
---
His detection now only works if at least 20% of his body is visible in the center of your screen. It also takes longer to reveal him than it does for him to expose you.
---
20:00 CET
---
OH SHIT DUDE 
---
I don't think I deserve this much credit, but thank you anyways. I hope to see you in the fog again!
---
Eh, it's only worth it during double bp events, where everyone is using their bp offerings. 
---
Or if multiple people disconnect and there's only one or two survivors left, I'll usually make the offer to them to play the game like normal or farm a bit.
---
I figured it meant like psychically doing it
---
Yea but what if 2 teammates are working on generators, and one team mate comes to help you and the killer doesent leave? The killer straight up just sits there and looks at you tunnel visioned and is fully aware that generators are possibly getting done and just doesent care(also beginning of game, so you haven't had time to make the killer mad you for looping him and such)
---
The feels when you do cleanse, but can't find the 5th totem
---
My math may be off but it is still absurdly fast. Good thing its like impossible to do.
---
I can only assume it was Noob3? lol putting his name on here is weird because you never know what people are going to say. His content is great, like mostly every one loves him and the only people who don't are people who just feel cool to not like someone who everybody likes
---
Shit better make me own style then hold on.
---
Yeah, because it's a cheap kill
---
I gave it an honest chance but this game is shit
---
While they are in deep wound, hit them. That's it. They don't have to go down by not mending, but you have to hit and down them while they're in deep wound
---
Funny enough, I just unlocked this achievement today.
---
[Deranged Pursuit](https://i.imgur.com/0fkWkQp.jpg)
---
As it says in the screenshot, just down survivors who are in Deep Wound state.
---
Devs said all characters are over 18
---
It's much easier now
---
This is fine
---
Less toxic? Suuuuure.
---
Oh its deep wounds?
---
If you read the backstory, it contradicts that
---
Well her humming will be replaced with a hula song
---
it seems really buggy honestly, ive literally pushed a killer out of the way with a pallet and not stunned them when they had a survivor in their arms.
---
Oh. I guess it's different on console lol
---
Friday the 13th was supppper chill, always loud and funny, never had a bad experience from the people
---
It doesn't always work. Try your method at rank 1 and get back to me. Beside the fact that good killers don't need to camp to win. The fact is you are wrong. The killers you complain about are not good killers. Have a nice day.
---
do you usually play with your bf because that would be awkard for me
---
One of the biggest reasons the lack of penalty for DCing tilts me is because players with no business being ranked anywhere above green just DC when they would have depipped. I played a game against a Wraith on blood lodge right before rank reset, and we had a Claudette that stalled at every. Single. Pallet. She dropped shack, all 4 pallets in the middle, and went down dropping a jungle gym pallet she stalled at, then DCed. So we all get destroyed because it's a 3v1 with no pallets left on the map. We get to endgame screen, and she's a rank 3 running no exhaustion perks, stake out and self care. There's no way she should ever be at red ranks, but she just DCs whenever she might depip.
---
Read? I can't even see.
---
Kinda, she was younger when they met but we don‚Äôt know how long they were the hanging around in Ormandy before they got taken by The Entity, it could have been quite a while given how far Frank was able to manipulate them.
---
I was rank 1 for a long time, but with the time, I've noticed that 9-12 ranks are way better to play.There are good survivors and most of them are not SWF or toxic, I have fun way more on these ranks.
---
Yeah I don't play survivor all that much. Haven't been as far as green since they changed over to emblems so I thought they just removed depipping. My bad
---
You have summoned the oinking infinite T3 Myers to aid of the Oinkers. You will cease this heresy at this moment. Don't worry my little pigs. I've got your back *muffled oink*
---
I play plague just to goof around and get quick points for the event. It's come to the point where as soon as the game ends I insta quit because of the attempts at trying to bully me.
---
Like sure, I'll still get the steam comments, but saying gg after killing everyone before a single gen is done is the most toxic thing I could do apparently. On par with sacrificing their first born.
---
In this case, sure. I'm simply giving in example of when BMing is ok.
---
I‚Äôm so lonely at this point I‚Äôd bang any of em
---
No I usually solo or play with a friend or two.
---
Because they know they‚Äôre gonna die - it‚Äôs more of defiant protest than anything else.
---
she does, clearly
---
As a plague player. Saying gg is the equivalent of murdering their first born child.
---
I'd love a xenomorph killer with Ripley as survivor. Or maybe the demogorgon and Steve from stranger things.
---
Rin is a butchered reanimated corpse with glass protrusions and so cold she‚Äôs blue but some boils in Adiris‚Äô face is where you draw the line?üò≠
---
Yeah it just makes you wonder if he would be OP if he had a hag style for traps, he can have 10 down at any given time. Because hag can teleport and hit but bear traps are basically an insta down. I would like to test that in a PTB before seeing it live but it's interesting to consider. 
---
and yeah i love leatherface. I always enjoy playing as him but 99ing and canceling my chainsaw just makes me want to just quit forever
---
This is bait, downvote, hide, and move on
---
I‚Äôd be a bigger fan of the game if it wasn‚Äôt survivor biased
---
Outplayed
---
Fr
---
I appreciate both of you, I'm genuinely surprised that it's an addon I've never seen used. Thanks guys.
---
Either Lightborn or just bad aiming.
---
I am a survivor main and I agree with the post, however if you are face camping and ignoring everything else to secure a kill, that does get quite frustrating, I hate when killers ruin Everyone else‚Äôs experience just for those ‚Äúextra blood points‚Äù when half the time they get less blood points then if they went after other objectives
---
Why not just chase them out? I ask this in an entirely serious way. Like if they leave when you chase them out then why not just ‚Äúpush‚Äù them out? And before someone says why can‚Äôt they just leave yeah they should, but if you say they don‚Äôt and it annoys you so much why not just run them out??
---
Why balance blue
---
I don‚Äôt like the perk as it cheeses people but if I‚Äôm playing a bad killer then imma run it
---
How can I tell if it's actually hitting him
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
welp it depends when and how you were using the flashlight. It takes a couple seconds to blind. You'll know it's working when the beam gets smaller and tightens.
---
If you're using it mid chase you're doing it completely wrong. best time to blind is during stuns, pallet kicks, vaults, and when they're picking up someone from the ground
---
Also the perk lightborn pretty much makes it impossible to get blinded
---
Last meme I made someone edited out my watermark and claimed it as their own and mods wouldn‚Äôt help me
---
I honestly think you're onto something. If they don't want to lift the bloodpoint cap they should halve the prices of the bloodweb items. That would be great.
---
What's your 3 favorite killer
---
It‚Äôs the little kid doge. I didn‚Äôt make that
---
That's very understandable haha
---
Right? Like I‚Äôve never understood why this bothers them so much when if you walk towards them the survivors will leave unless they‚Äôre absolutely dumb and want to die??
---
Self care with ad?
---
It usually works.
---
Im rank 6 on both Killer and survivor
---
I think taking a break for a bit will definitely help you to have some more fun. It's a game, if you aren't having fun then you might want to find a different game.
---
The beam should be tightening.
---
O dats me
---
Reverse Bear Traps, Pig's power
---
I'll keep this short.
---
Ruin and BBQ are staples of the game.
---
Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Pop Goes the Weasel, Overcharge, Brutal Strength, Save the Best For Last, Enduring. All good choices.
---
Hurtful, that's how that is.
---
It's basically impossible to blind against a killer that's moving and has some basic knowledge. Flashlights are only going to actually work if the killer is stuck in an animation. I'd recommend to watch a tutorial on flashlights if nothing works.
---
trapper and hillbilly give me more anxiety tbh, especially hillbilly when i‚Äôm opening a gate
---
As she was "looping" me in killer shack?
---
#nut
---
Maybe it's the salty survivor main in me, but there was nothing well played about this clip. She whiffed multiple easy hits, and only got a kill on the original Laurie because the other one was as braindead as humanly possible and both missed a pallet stun and unhooked in spirits face with a mori. The original Laurie was dead no matter what, even if she drops that pallet on spirit, because spirit can just phase and catch up. Like yeah, toxic teabagging survivor gets shit on, but let's not pretend the spirit did literally anything above or even at average here.
---
The beam from the flashlight will gradually tighten and eventually like ‚Äúbounce‚Äù as the ‚Äòkiller blind‚Äô score event pops on your screen.
---
Ah, yeah, mr "I play Killer more" shows his true colors finally. You seem to think because double BP is on, survivors should just be given free rides to act like fucking idiots, apparently.
---
you don't have to like it, being neutral about is it correct.
---
I get 5 minute queues outside of bloodhunt at purples in US West they're always shit
---
Because if i camp the hook, then it's campingü§£ follow one of them and it can't be camping, idk, I'm main survivor and when I play killer i never stay next to the hook, go and look for other survivors or gens to kick.ü§£ü§∑
---
99ing the saw feels awful.  
---
I doubt Trapper would be OP, as he has fewer traps and needs survivors to walk directly on the trap.
---
You won‚Äôt get banned for cheating unless you are cheating.
---
that's exactly what I'm saying. I have no issue dying if I can get someone upset enough to shoot themselves in the foot.
---
THANK YOU. Someone understand's Bubba Chainsaw is actually not entirely ass when used correctly.
---
I can honestly say - good. You come across as someone who is in desperate need of a slap upside the head.
---
So every killer sucks because they can't find survivors.
---
What
---
Do you mean the Plague's generator denied perk? I never thought about that synergy, but huh, interesting. 
---
But yeah, crouching or using a flashlight to destroy the traps is the best option, but I know braindead teammates are the issue here. Something I tend to do is if I know someone is being chased across the map or is being carried, I run around and set off as many traps as I can so the Hag can't take advantage of them and my teammates don't bumble into them like idiots.
---
I go to work at 2 üò≠
---
This is actually a very valid point but it's not just Adiris' face. It's at least half her torso, head, and one arm. Honestly I might not actually care. Idk.
---
Actually the survivor perks in the back were made by someone else. You can find it here:  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3400431](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3400431) 
---
I'll consider uploading the killer perks once I have the chance!
---
You will watch your tone.
---
Will you get banned playing killer with not great internet? No. Does it make you a dick playing killer with a not great connection? Kind of, but if a survivor bitches about lag tell them to check the pregame lobby ping next time.
---
Unironically my favourite killer.
---
I only give hatch if he was a good player that wasn‚Äôt toxic
---
Try submitting a [support ticket](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us)
---
During endgame I used Urban to unhook the last remaining survivor only for them to sprint off, set the trap off and I got insta downed from NoeD while Meg ran out the exit I‚Äôd opened. 
---
I can laugh now but at the time I wanted to tear my own face off, I was fuming lol. 
---
If she‚Äôd crouched away we would‚Äôve both made it easily :‚Äô)
---
I did this not long ago. Thats why I always start a chat with every teammate when playing survivor (PS4).
---
How about the lag switches on PC while they are at it?
---
This is a huge problem for me as killer.  I'll be somewhere a ways across the map, hear the unhook and not have any track on anyone else, I go back to the hook, and the guy who just got unhooked is running in the open, into a fire barrel or some shit, and the dude who saved him just ghosted.  I can only chase what I see.  Generally, I'll down the guy I can see and go looking rather than put him back up on a hook that fast, but damn... Dudes need to take care of their potatoes at least a little bit.
---
So just use it to reach windows and pallets
---
Self Care, Mettle of Man, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time
---
it also makes gaining points from killing the other 3 much easier.
---
An add-on like that sounds so fun, but it'll be too strong if you don't give it a nerf.  
---
I've always wanted bouncing-hatchets for Huntress.
---
This. Adds another layer to her power against loops and cutting people off.
---
Pretty much if the killer hits you and leave you on the ground it allows you to fully recover and pick yourself back up, but you're stuck in the injured state.
---
Dude I'm gonna be honest some ppl are going to listen this community won't change plus this community is fine the way it is we wouldn't have many funny memes about the other side I'm just saying some people like it like this
---
That's what makes it a very good perk, not making the killer miss.
---

---
Pallets should stun Nurse if you miraculously time it to hit her mid-blink. A reward for skill and not a waste of a pallet.
---
All I know is that when I play as survivor I ‚Äúteabag‚Äù for maybe 20 different reasons and its usually not meant to be negative. We don‚Äôt exactly have the option to communicate with the killer otherwise - it‚Äôs not like we have sprays.
---
Well done
---
I would be okay with this ONLY if they replace irid heads with this lol
---
nope, cannibal would take that spot
---
How dare you compare ugly bastard to futanari, smh
---
oh no. what happened to your other BS account??? oh, it got deleted! 
---
http://archive.is/8rZ6Y
---
HAHAHAHAHAA
---
 I seriously don't understand people who think this will change if they complain about it?
---
Oh yeah, the Legion became the most universally hated killer in the games history because he was easy to deal with. Legion with Frank's Mixtape was actually broken and moonwalking made them mediocre, other than that they were terrible. Every one of these strats had one thing in common though: zero counter play. There is nothing you can do to outplay old Legion. You can't loop because of the vaulting mechanic and you can't 360 because missing doesn't do anything.
---
Maybe for the Halloween event this year??
---
BHVR please make it happen d(^_^o)
---
Honestly everything is fair game, if it‚Äôs doable in game then do it if you like, if it didn‚Äôt let you get the 4k or allow you to escape then maybe try something else, you got a killer who camped you untill you died well then tough luck suck it up and jump into a new game
---
I make killers really salty so they actually facecamp me lol. Ez win for everybody else ig.
---
But that 100 survival points just feels so gooooood
---
It's more about not being able to bloodlust at God pallet than shortening the loops through the window. It is often left until the end because killers would rather waste 45 sec getting bloodlust 3 than risk losing a kill once gates are open.
---
The original comment literally said he left to check gens and only returned when he saw scratches. That's playing the game. Wait till the killers gone or be sneaky about it but don't get upset because you got too thirsty for the save. 
---
If you looked at all the other comments in this thread you'd see this guy have it explained to him again and again. Just can't reach some people i guess.
---
Iridescent Head is such bullshit.  
---
I'd be good with Rubber Hatchets anyways; it just sounds so fun.
---
Lol i respect your persistence if nothing else
---
They also try to stop hacking people's account you spammer  posting scam warning post on other people's post. Now you may stop spamming/hacking people's account.
---
I fixed it! I just reverted my graphics drivers back to a previous version. My frames are back to normal now!
---
Rofl. Name something besides NOED that helps the killer actually win? Meanwhile, survivors have MoM, which rewards them for getting hit. Weird, huh? Something that rewards you for being bad at the game? That sounds like NOED, which survivors swear up and down is evil yet MoM can't be removed by the killer. Hmmm. Hypocritical much? Survivors ALSO have instaheals and Deliverance for their fuckups. Killers don't have shit on survivors. This game is in no way killer sided dipass.
---
I don't...understand what you mean/what your issue is? We're sharing stories here. I reported the person in-game but as far as I know nothing ever came of it. Do you behave the way that person did and feel attacked or something?
---
Spam them for teachable perks you already got, and get them again from the shrine for a lot of bloodpoints.
---
End game chat when a survivor is toxic: "whatever man I just pressed cntrl a few times, you need to get thicker skin" 
---
End game chat when killer is toxic in return and kills survivor : " uR SO BAd, WoW, carryIng A Mor√≠ aNd spAMing The ANimation , crutch, Why BM? NO WonDer Ur Bad."
---
That's incorrect, the act of standing up after unhooking or whatever will not set off a trap, not until you move. You can do the unhook, let the character finish, and then crouch after. You are not required to hold crouch the whole time.
---
"Yet". Key word. You'll find it.
---
People aren't playing killer because killers are more powerful, but because playing killer yield's more blood point, it has nothing to do with balance
---
from my experience my team is dead in the first 4 minutes if we don't cleanse so I just do it
---
hitboxes, constant perk nerfs for survivors and buffs for killers, BBQ and NC combined with billy and Nurse are unbeatable. and instas are an add-on... rare... all the crutches killers have are perks.
---
Some of y'all just can't have fun unless you're winning and it shows
---
No need to be rude. Also it's kinda hard to sense sarcasm on here.
---
I love when I step on a well placed hag trap and it makes me jump.  I just hate that most Hags use her power to essentially camp the hook.
---
I used to create a lobby in 5 secs, now I take 5 mins as killer, after this double BP event, i'll play some GhostFace, then i'll come back only after they solve it, I have really few hours to play daily, can't waste it looking for matches.
---
I got over 100 games on PS4, why should I waste them?
---
Camping is bad. You, however, have been a disingenuous clown from the word go, purposefully ignoring the original statements, twisting others words. Even here, you act like my reaction is to you claiming camping is bad. Camping IS bad. What YOU seem to think camping is, however, is DRASTICALLY different from what it actually is.
---
They fixed that awhile back
---
7 seconds to fall asleep and also getting out of dreamworld is RNG. He's just a M1 killer who is hindered by his ability. Although the dream transition allows a lot of mind games so if played properly it's a free first hit. It's not like people just walk all over freddy but he's the easiest killer to beat
---
Yea they already tried catering to cry baby killers and it killed the playerbase. So now they need to take all the instadowns, and op shit out the game so we can start playing it again.
---
There may be better loops but there is no single stronger pallet
---
This is happening even before the BP, taking forever to make a lobby.
---
You said it, it's because of the rank (no offense) In those ranks survivors complain a lot about the doctor for example, if only they knew what a pro nurse does
---
Well he's not you I don't think all that aplys that to one person
---
That's almost certainly not true lol. Not to mention that if you shock me and turn for the window, I'm just gonna run the other way around the shack
---
Because his counter is as simple as failing a skill check.
---
Against low ranked survivors who aren't very good at looping and play in a very immersed non aggressive way he can dominate the game.
---
Once you get higher in ranks with survivors who can decently loop, don't crouch behind a rock every time they get into the killer's terror radius, and put as much pressure on the gens as they can, he really struggles.
---
At the higher ranks it doesn't make a difference to survivors if you know where they are because they aren't hiding afraid of getting into a chase and they know you can only be on one of them at a time.
---
His two biggest problems are that he struggles at ending chases quickly and doesn't have a whole lot of map pressure. With his rework of having snares/ fake pallets and being able to teleport to gens it should make him better in both of these areas.
---
How much better is yet to be seen, but personally I think he'll be in a much better place.
---
Thank u biased Cowrus
---
&gt;trapper and hag hybrid 
---
Oh god please mo
---
I mean, people going out of their way to add you to a group chat and ask "Farm???"
---
DbD community in a nutshell I guess.
---
Sentinel on legion...
---
Since killer generally earns more bp it is likely that many players are playing killer during the event to stack up on bp for GF or just in general for their survivors. 
---
BBQ + this event is great and is likely why so many players are playing killer.
---
He gets dominated at better ranks mainly because:
---
-He has no chase ability and will get looped
---
-The dream transition means you can't get a reliable first hit on survivors, making chases potentially twice as long.
---
-Survivors can easily break the dream state with self care or a gen.
---
-He can't punish aggressive survivors doing stuff like risky unhooks, again due to the dream transition time.
---
If you read the thread, OP says he just picked up killer less than a week ago
---
Also this is dumb we don't need to change a rarity system for no reason at all it's just dumb
---
The guy im talking about is wrong about his personal experience? Lol.
---
I love it especially the perks but they aren't in the style of DbD as 2 of the perks should be completely useless and the third should be maybe viable or completely broken.
---
Corny
---
GREAT VIDEO mate!
---
Imagine caring about fake internet points because you have nothing else to live for in your life lmao
---
Freddy crushes low ranks cause they have no idea how to run the killer.
---
It's just a change I perk rareties that don't make sense. This wasn't supposed to be a game changing post, sorry I didn't give the step by step process to completely fix the game of whatever.
---
Play as a Killer and Survivor, you‚Äôll learn how Killers abilities work and how best to avoid them when Survivor and vice versa
---
THey want the rescue points for the unhook, seen plenty of assholes do it during the weekend, most of them once they feel they are losing the match so they just want some bloodpoints whatever the cost.
---
You would also have to be hit with a pallet 8 times
---
I think this is definitely a better way of thinking of how to design/balance this power, but I think there are still a lot of flaws in it that I can't imagine how to address.
---
&gt; then maybe have the shapeshifter turn into the last survivor he/she hooked or downed
---
If you see a Dwight get hooked then, you know you can avoid the killer as long as you don't go near any Dwights. This limits the killers power way too much.
---
&gt; again part of the perk is that they can pretend to be working on gens or sabotaging a hook or totem that lures survivors close because they want to help
---
I think this is the biggest flaw of thinking: Once survivors know you're playing as the shapeshifter killer (which will happen as soon as they see you attack someone while disguised, or if they see you transform, which is what I meant earlier about you being able to attack each survivor once before your power is worthless), they're not going to help each other anymore. They're going to split off to work on different gens and won't let anyone get close to them, so the killer will never be able to ambush a survivor more than once.
---
Love it when survivors act all toxic then they get hooked or moried and they dc.
---
What if you have borrowed and need to get some distance away so you can run the killer a bit more and buy everyone time? Isn‚Äôt running the killer the whole point while others do gens?
---
As you said, THAT is the real win
---
Its just surprising to learn this as I get grabs all the time on pig, and so the fact that survivors do have some warning to avoid getting pulled as I stand up is almost comical to hear.
---
BH doesn‚Äôt even need to have brainstorming sessions, they have a slew of great ideas like this one for free right here.
---
don‚Äôt talk like that to my girl
---
Forgot the white ward
---
What an amazing idea ! I have always thought that the keeper looks very cool and is very unique compared to other horrorgame characters. I really hope that this idea becomes reality! üòé
---
Thank u
---
I stay at the exit gate and refuse to leave unless smacked out.
---
If you don‚Äôt smack me out, I will heal and unhook/bodyblock my teammates.
---
I‚Äôll make you spend that extra time hitting me out to give my teammates more time to escape.
---
Yeah I don't know what is up with the bloodwebs this last weekend but they have been amazing. I wonder if BHVR turned up the rates for some items. I swear its been the same for me.  Spend one get one. Also I have been getting some great perks. My pig got all three BBQ tiers in a row.
---
I had three survivors all crouched around the basement where the 4th was hooked, waiting for me to leave, not doing anything else, for the entire two minutes.
---
And I was Freddy.
---
How many times you said this to someone? lmao you a lame. You just waiting around the corner of every post in hopes someone says something about upvotes. Idc about the points it just confuses me why people do this. Go find something else to do lil boy
---
Then I don't have a major issue with it. My issue is when players pull someone off the hook the second the killer turns around after hooking someone when that person doesn't have WGLF and is taking a protection hit, or BT to help prevent you from being tunnelled. Then it's just like "rly dude...ur gonna cost someone the game bc ur that greedy?"
---
How about the killer just open the gate themselves? You know killers are actually the ones abusing EGC, right? Leaving the final survivor slugged and waiting out the timer, which is a lot longer of a ‚Äúhostage situation‚Äù then the killer has to deal with. They can control their situation by opening the gate and /or chasing survivors out. The survivor on the ground literally can do nothing about it.
---
Thank you. It‚Äôs very true, and I wish more people would think this way. Negativity doesn‚Äôt fix negativity.
---
Are you referring to the Deathgarden mask?
---
What's sadder? The fact that this change occurred with their rushed pipping system, or the fact that BVHR seems completely unaware of it?
---
It will get rid of the bad killers that only rely on crutches and they'll get replaced by better killers. Powers can still be useful without instadowns they should be reworked and used to end chases like Billy and Nurses do.
---
Everyone knows claudette faces are the best
---
this will change after the 2x blood points
---
damn you need a rework
---
Well that's the fun part is when they're about to fall asleep and they think their safe but you're not where they think you are. add ons depends on play style tho. I mean obviously pill bottle is pretty much one of his best add ons. 
---
And yeah i can talk about dbd all day i love this game...plus i pretty much just sit on this sub all day at work anyway lol
---
Running BT and/or DS to counter your teammates farming each other üòçüòÇ
---
Yah I‚Äôve said it in another post, these events bring out the cockroaches!!!
---
What these incompetent players forget to think about is if some of these people are new players? If so they won‚Äôt be back to play this game because of how shitty the killers all have been and for what maybe a few extra blood points? When if they played the correct way they could get a shit load more points or even made it a farming event. I‚Äôve been able to play killer a little bit and I‚Äôve made sure to let everyone get points and have fun, some farming and some drawn out games where they all died.
---
&gt; To deny toxic killers from benefiting from the bonus BP.
---
Killer: "I would like to play the game like I'm supposed to"
---
Toxic survivors: "Wow what a toxic killer I'm going to sacrifice all my BP just so he doesn't get as much BP!"
---
I think you‚Äôre assuming way to much about how people play this game and I think that a character should be built and tested before you say it just won‚Äôt work. Also they are constantly shifting forms so it‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äúavoid the Dwight‚Äôs‚Äù because he‚Äôs still a killer, he can still catch you and down you without any powers the disguise just puts you on edge because you‚Äôll never know if it‚Äôs actually a survivor approaching or not. On top of that if they decide to just split up and work on gens then you could have the time to destroy their active generators by clicking back the progress basically forcing them to work together or their gems will just be dismantled if they add the generator regression perk I suggested.
---
Exactly and then it‚Äôs even dumber because then there‚Äôs no pallet there for the rest of the game so if you need it later you‚Äôre fucked because one douchebag on your team thought it would be funny to just slam it in front of you while you‚Äôre being chased
---
The plague has the hour glass figure and is super tall sign me up
---
Oof, rest in peppermint
---
Pretty fucking simple - camping is staying within 16 meters of the hook when someone is on it. Your average terror radius is twice that. At that distance, a Killer can easily grab you off if you attempt to unhook someone. 
---
Otherwise, if you could grab someone and get them off the hook, they are not fucking camping. They may be counting on you to have done that, in which case it's called a good play, because you took a risk, and now you are in a risky situation. It's almost like that's how the fucking game was designed or something.
---
Let me start by saying that my knowledge on programming is minimal at best so I have no idea how feasible any of these are. But I am dating a data scientist so I have a little intel lol. Just a few ideas come to mind just based on my experience and what the community often talks about. 
---
I think that a BP calculator would be neat. So often, people ask how many BP will it take to _____, whether it‚Äôs to P3 a person or get all the perks in the game on someone. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some way to approximate the average cost of a bloodweb. Maybe in 2 ways, the first being frugal and buying mostly brown/yellows, and the second being going for the best nodes. You could have just a checkbox system of ‚ÄúHow do you intend to spend your BP?‚Äù with the options of conservatively and liberally. 
---
If you were able to combine that with a checkbox system where people could mark what teachables they had, and the system could incorporate the finite number of general perks available to everyone, it could give an approximation. So if the system knew you had, say, 10 teachables unlocked and there are 20 (don‚Äôt know exact figure) general perks, and all have 3 tiers, it would take 90 bloodwebs to get everything. From there, it could calculate the average BP needed for that many webs based on how the user is spending them. It could even go farther and approximate how many games (killer and/or survivor) it would take to get that, based on average earnings. 
---
Another idea... people often want to preview various pieces of cosmetics together. There‚Äôs no way in-game to easily do that in a dynamic (viewed 360) way without owning some of the pieces. It would take some graphical knowledge but it‚Äôd be neat to be able to essentially choose a character and then a cosmetic piece from the 3 categories and preview them together on a model that can be rotated. I feel like it‚Äôs not a necessary thing but I have heard plenty of people wish that were implemented in-game so they can see how things look before purchasing.
---
My masculinity is too fragile for somebody that tall, I‚Äôm intimidated.
---
Ah maybe? I dunno what that is
---
It was more like a seizure than a t-bag, and he kinda deserved it. He was camping at the hooks. Why do you think 2 out three survivors disconnected in rage. I glad I tricked him, and it was nice he had a good sense of humor about it.
---
I've had an idea (not fully thought out), how funny would it be if survivors can run a mori? i mean not a mori but something similar. Like killers get the option to just end someones game if they've been hooked. 
---
something like this would be funny:
---
After 5 pallet stuns you have the ability to kill/remove the killer and end the trial. 
---
Idk, idk what the requirements would be and how the killer would be removed but i think that would be funny.
---
what rank do you usually play in? out of curiousity
---
Rofl. You just decide to say the equivalent of "Nu-uh, my side is right and you're wrong!" Add to that a lazy insult like "Bye baby boy" and we get what can only be a feeble minded infant trapped in the body of an overweight pedophile. You have no evidence to back up your claim and no social skills besides. I'd say good luck but clearly God decided that your life was gonna be fucked from the get-go. Sorry pal.
---
I'm ready for regular games again. I did so much farming over the weekend, my PS4 gave me a trophy for Stardew Valley.
---
I'm rank 7
---
Ah yes of course, teabagging, I totally forgot. 
---
Please forgive me, your oinkness.
---
I am just a piglet who loves to serve the almighty Amanda.
---
Life goes on..
---
This is opposite if you're on PS4 after double bp. Survivor lobbies take forever, killer lobbies are quick. Double bp just makes every one play killer for better gains
---
Yup, I play mostly killer I often avoid 2x bloodpoint events because of how unbalanced the wait times become.
---
What‚Äôs the point of P3 killers? Do you get anything special? I have Amanda, Myers, Legion, and Plague ready to go but I‚Äôm on the fence
---
She has multiple teachables tier 3, knows the best spirit build in the game, has a super powerful purple add-on combo and is running a mori. She's not new lmao
---
Sometimes... Bps get wasted
---
Love this song
---
GODDAMIT I MISS THE HASHBROWNS!
---
I would like it but all killers have to do is camp to win pretty much and there are a lot of campers
---
Gotta mori them all
---
Found the teabagging Laurie
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Wake the fuck up, dweet.
---
We have a trial to escape.
---
It just means to have to put some effort and skill into your end game build instead of just saving all your traps like portable hooks
---
You just reminded me Nurse had a red head skin that looks like she was definitely a head turner
---
Cosmetics only really, I just did it for completion‚Äôs sake but if you go for it I would recommend doing 1 at a time, as having multiple killers with no good perks or add-ons is a major pain.
---
Oh shit true. I've been bamboozled
---
You will be forgiven once you pass your test...
---
Hes a-sexual
---
Damn, i love talking about a serial killer's sexuality
---
Back in my day NOED wasn't a hex!
---
Skeleton key is the survivor version of a Mori imo. Thankfully there‚Äôs no daily for that damn key though.
---
They get knocked out for 30 seconds and you have to drag them to the hatch and throw them in, up to two people can drag the body a second person makes it faster. There‚Äôs some skill involved in that you have to find the hatch then lure the killer in.
---
The amount of times I've been hooked, the killer's within kissing distance, and the other three all run up for the save. Like, at least wait til the TR's gone if you're not gonna leave me on my first hook.
---
It feelsbad when people avoid you simply because you‚Äôre tall but I suppose I understand where you‚Äôre coming from in a way
---
HACKZ
---
I have a hard time getting friends to stick around too. There‚Äôs a steep learning curve to this game and most people don‚Äôt have the will or motivation to learn the game and improve their skill. 
---
They get slaughtered immediately and it permanently deters them.
---
I main pig too is it bannable to do that?
---
I mean I‚Äôm a fairly tall guy, but I‚Äôm pretty sure Plague is about a foot and a half taller. No disrespect to any tall guys and girls here though.
---
https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/editor/60/pqvx6cpmzjiw.png
---
I'd argue that it does both, to be honest. But moreso the killer failing.
---
Noed only procs when the exit gates are opened. If the exit gates are powered, the killer has failed at providing adequate map pressure and murder. Totems, yes, they can be cleansed; but it's not an actual objective to the gameplay.
---
Wait I‚Äôm confused what am i looking at?
---
He knows what it does, he meant it retrospectively. Like the devs say "it is supposed to be hard mode for survivors", which is fucking stupid.
---
No, since it doesn't hold the game hostage. It is however a dick move that should only be used against the most toxic people in the game.
---
My third favorite killer? Hmm. 
---
Maybe not a popular opinion here but I got to go with Hag. She‚Äôs got good perks, though they are risky, being all Hex perks. You don‚Äôt see a lot of Hags which is a shame but I‚Äôve encountered plenty of powerful ones in my time. Monitor + Abuse perk and Rusty Shackles add-on can lead to some pretty fun moments.
---
Also, imho, best Mori in the game.
---
Better than GhostFace. Fight me.
---
lmao that's pretty hilarious. Imagine a trapper getting dragged across the map by 1 leg. I mean i was thinking something more along the lines of that end game death animation but for the killer. Entities like "ya fckin suck you're coming with me" and then rips em under
---
Billy has instadowns though
---
ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Experienced this myself as well. I got one guy hooked so to speak, once he got his first killer stun it was all downhill from there.
---
Lol fair enough
---
That actually sounds fun lol
---
Like if someone burnes an offering then escapes they get an extra 500 bp and the killer gets punished for letting you go
---
J
---
As a Daddy Myers main. Can confirm, this is accreate.
---
Hamstring seems like it is literally just Clowns power with less effort.
---
Sentinel is easily OP, 10% gen regression is ridiculous per hit especially if it has no cooldown and there are ways of switching obsessions now. I can only imagine that on Legion where you can just spam hit the survivor an infinite number of times to basically regress all gens down with ease.
---
Amen, I down want anyone whining about egc... its literally easy af for killers now.. make a choice
---
It's beautiful
---
I mean if we're suggesting the ersatz Pyramid Head, why not go for the real deal? Konami executives would probably license him out to a themed male stripper club if it meant milking more money out of the Silent Hill franchise.
---
Bloodpoint Calc would be awesome
---
It just takes longer for achievements to update on console that's it
---
I cant seem to understand the whole getting triggered by someone spamming the crouch button or even comparing it to camping literally 2 different things. 1 doesnt effect the game whatsoever(tbaggin), the other effects the game tremendously(camping)..
---
I can tell you're a monkey by your horrible grammar. Stop worrying about internet points and go finish the 3rd grade.
---
Maybe an rng perk wheel/selection and or killer/survivor. If it's all on one website it'd be super helpful for people like me who sometimes can't decide.
---
How about no blood points for unhooking unless they get away safe, in know you get bonus for safe unhook but take away the initial unhook points add them to the safe unhook points and maybe people will be less of an asshole when unhooking
---
Being a dickhead.  Is the exact same as being a dickhead!!

---
Because if no one cleanses she‚Äôs weak
---
Shhhhhhh
---
Happy to help (:
---
On the other hand, if you have 2 people in the lobby really good at chases, and the first guy guys down using almost zero pallets after a minute or 2, that shit is actually really handy for the rest of the survivors
---
No early game hook pressure from the killer, everyone gets to finish gen they were working on, and the game becomes 2 gens left vs 3 survivors
---
But yeah- what you described, I'd rather have those types of players run in straight lines to the corners of the map and apply a perma Thana stack on us all than use up central pallets
---
He was but the other survivors wasn't. One of them even reported me for boosting
---
I guess if that's your definition, sure, but it doesn't seem that useful to me. Like if I move 1m to the right and change nothing else about how I'm playing, it's suddenly a completely different thing? That seems like an arbitrary distinction more than a meaningful one to me.
---
Call them whatever you want but this dude was like "if prefer it if you called her Amanda Young. " plus, Michael Myers is much more well known, you don't have to be a Halloween fan to know him, the same does not go for Amanda Young.
---
How do you wish to punish these non-believers my leader?
---
The point being made is that you're making a very simplified claim that they're the same because they both allow a match to end early.
---
I'm stating that they're 'not' the 'same' because one actually requires an endgame to use, the other can be used in the first 3 minutes of a match. That's a collosal difference.

TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY BHVR!!!
---
I remember that, it lasted forever, what a nightmare.
---
eh nothing is gonna happen probably. I mean if you get reported a bunch of times maybe but i doubt one report is gonna get you any issues
---
So brave.
---
New and dumb killer who might pick the game back up again soon, how do you lunge versus doing a normal hit?
---
and there goes the dude who had nothing interesting to say
---
Pretty sure that's basically the Freddy rework
---
&gt; Also they are constantly shifting forms so it‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äúavoid the Dwight‚Äôs‚Äù 
---
Ah, I only meant that if their power only turns them into the last survivor hooked/downed. Since a survivors can always see when someone is hooked or downed, they'll always know when the killers form changes, and who it will change to.
---
&gt; I think you‚Äôre assuming way to much about how people play this game and I think that a character should be built and tested before you say it just won‚Äôt work
---
That's fair, especially on the built-and-tested part. I just can't see how a killer like this could work, especially if it was designed to trick survivors and make them paranoid of each other. For SWF teams with mics that will never work, full stop. For non-SWF teams, the concept itself seems far too easy to counter, especially when you mix detection perks into it.
---
Do You Want me to tell you how I got these scars?
---
2 or 3 were t-bagging me at the exit gate thinking I was gonna try &amp; get them. I just stood there lol
---
How dare you disrespect my religious leader?
---
Ha ! Oh I have one. But yeah I hear ya
---
If I'm playing survivor, I always call out other survivors in post-game chat when they teabag for no reason.
---
Oh god imaging enduring teir 3 with iron skin teir 3 with 8 tokens 
---
You don't get stunned you just get head slammed and walk on through it like it's nothing
---
Maybe, but what if the killer could see in 3rd person? I feel like that would more than make up for the easy counter
---
I think it‚Äôs fine it rewards you for surviving
---
This literally happened to me today as Hag.
---
They didn't even hide they ran around me expecting me to leave and complained when they all died. If that's a problem then maybe someone should have had Borrowed time?
---
Not saying that purposefully camping us good but BT helps with stupid teammates
---
it's bugged. other windows are bugged too. Springwood was fcked for a little while. but yeah you can only slow/medium vault that window
---
Your religion is flawed
---
Can't you spend BP from survivors on killers? If so, they might have just been under the impression that they can't learn if they don't research and prepare a meta build in advance. Which feels accurate to my experience, playing killer is hard.
---
A lunge comes from holding down the attack button rather than just a tap or click
---
What the FUCK
---
It is 100% boosting but if everyone is fine with it and you dont do it every game, its usually fine.
---
I like laargness
---
You guys cant even organize an attack when your "leader" says too,cmon you gotta say that's a flaw
---
Just DC. Stop ruining things just because you don't like it.
---
Could be they were worried about their performance and over prepared? I see it a lot in MMOs, people can freak out about trying roles they don't play and do some crazy stuff to prep.
---
no because everyone is one shot
---
I dont think he is better then myers, but im willing to see changes if it makes both sides happy. Thats a win win. 
---
Persoanlly, i think they should nerf the stalking in a chase some how so he cant do it, but isntead maybe give him movespeed after marking
---
No shit it‚Äôs just a game little one. I‚Äôm saying if you look at the memes and comments from a lot of survivors they seem like they feel killers shouldn‚Äôt be playing the role their name signifies. I don‚Äôt expect them to literally be afraid of a computer avatar and if you think that‚Äôs the point I was making... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ, there‚Äôs no help for you.
---
Yea, also I've noticed it goes back to normal after around 10 o clock pm est. I find games in about a minute as killer then, and its clear I'm facing the usual survivor mains, based upon their skill
---
Plague who??? I haven‚Äôt seen or heard of her on PS4 I think BhVR released that killer, oh wait I remember now, 
---
NOBODY FUCKING PLAYS HER ON PS4 BECAUSE OF THE MANY PROBLEMS ON CONSOLE THAT SHE HAS!
---
I would be lying if I said there aren't any stupid survivors who do this... 
---
But I would also be lying if I said that camping doesn't exist either. I've had my fair share of being face/proximity camped as well as receiving hate mail for "camping" and catching someone who was trying to save in front of me. 
---
It goes both ways guys, get rid of your bias. No side is completely innocent.
---
It balances out though because each survivor doesn‚Äôt have to open the hatch, only one does. The killer has to down all the survivors a total of 8 times to Mori all of them.
---
No, still up to RNG mostly.
---
GlenOck can be unorganized at times. I will admit he should improve that
---
It's an Ultra Rare add-on. So it's not something he can do every match. 
---
Normal Myers has a Tier 3 that only lasts about a minute or so then resets to Tier 2.
---
Myers is actually the most balanced killer in the game. He can be extremely strong with certain rare addons but they come with a trade off.
---
And he is very versatile but he can also be countered.
---
Breaking line of sight can deny him his Tiers and hopping in a locker can force a hook if he's trying to kill you with a tombstone.
---
And Tier 1 spooky myers build can be looped for ages if you can predict his movements.
---
To be fair having a stunted growth doesn‚Äôt morally excuse her for killing people, she‚Äôs still a fully grown woman she just never learned how to act human, I be more scared or her biting a chuck out of me than I would be worried if she understands intercourse
---
Some people can‚Äôt be helped.
---
Agreed. I'm a survivor main and love playing against her, one of the smoothest and most fun killers to play against imo.
---
Iridescent gatekeeper and 5-6 chases won? I think she safetied at least
---
Clown is a similar experience that actually works well on console. Huntress is doable, but super hard on PS4.
---
Yeah, people rarely run with it but it‚Äôs quite useful. Get a teammate with a key and it‚Äôs even more handy. I can literally thank this add-on for getting me the ‚ÄúWhere did they go?‚Äù Trophy.
---
What would this "attack" even accomplish?why bother with one person's post about why they hate oinkers?
---
Don‚Äôt play him. Just get BBQ, it is extremely useful. Second option is piggy, because oink.
---
It‚Äôll be closer to noon than midnight
---
There‚Äôs a lesson to be had here, thanks for sharing!
---
thank you!
---
I have all the killers and survivors, I usually buy them with really money because they are inexpensive and support future Developement if the game :) the only other things are teachables, which i have most the good ones, and outfits, which i probably won't use
---
Please feel free to compare us to anything but that,
---
Appreciate it trying to figure who's perks will fit best with playstyle
---
Well the perks are still crap, but hopefully the character is good.
---
This way funny to watch, take my up vote.
---
But honestly what I hate when playing both survivor and killer is when a survivor teabags and acts as toxic as he can, but when the killer retaliates and is toxic back they dc. It's as if they can dish it out but not take it.
---
I'd imagine if they're going to do that they'd start with looking up what it is they need. But yeah, it could go either way.
---
I think they release at midnight UK time which is in 2 hours roughly
---
Sorry but can you say they're not similar in that way?
---
yea obviously your opinion seems very valuable and well constructed.
---
10/10 can relate
---
welp my advice is don't trap hooks. Trapping hooks is a waste of traps. The more loops and vaults you have covered the better.
---
Did it work?
---
America fucking sucks
---
Sorry? He chose it.
---
I‚Äôd rather hear screaming vegans than see kids do Fortnite dances. And yes I suppose there is a small similarity
---
I'm gonna murder you because i already knew it three weeks ago xD
---
You didn‚Äôt create that
---
The_Unhooker would be a cool PS4 name
---
Does she save you from the Entity‚Äôs grasp in DBD or does she solicit you to have sexual relations and then pay YOU afterwards? ‚ÄòTis a mystery
---
one of her outfits literally says shes a sophomore
---
It‚Äôs unreal. I still play but it‚Äôs frustrating as hell
---
"How dare you raise up your middle finger at me! I cannot believe you would do something so disgusting as using your fingers muscles to manipulate your skeletons middle finger independant of the rest!"

Tl;dr its the fucking intent, not the action.
---
Thanks, I needed to see others expirience this. People just save as mad men in the blood harvest, all with borrowed time, so of course I am going to stay near to catch them before they unhook
---
I got the game when it came out but i took a break from it after myers came out. But the last 3 months i have gotten hooked again
---
It only just started happening with Plague, which makes me think it's something on their end, rather than on the user end.
---
And all of that is fine, but not addressing it at all/pretending it's not even happening sucks.
---
I've had about 4 killers DC on me, and they all were doctors who only shocked for the first two minutes

Her leg seems to be facing the wrong way
---
√òink?
---
A huntress with insidious is useless anyway... you can still hear her lullaby
---
You just admitted you aren‚Äôt a good killer, if you can‚Äôt adapt to different play styles. Then you‚Äôll continue to decline in skill.
---
She might have a mind of a 6 year old but she could be like 24 or older

Scary at first, but quickly disappears

Not to mention you give the killer a few ending points as well, Something good for both sides as long as you dont find it bittersweet

What‚Äôs that on the finger?
---
Understand this: **I don't care that you don't like it**. Even if majority is on your side, the rules are clear: **you are the one displaying unsportsmanlike behavior.** What you try to impose on me is **not normal gameplay**. It will never qualify as such in the eyes of the developer or, indeed, in the eyes of anyone with a fucking shred of common sense. It doesn't even qualify as gameplay. There are no stakes. It's just farming. The versus aspect of this asymmetrical PVP game is done away with.
---
All I ask in this multiplayer PVP game is that you **play the fucking game** and yet you are dense or entitled enough to act like that's an unreasonable request.
---
My favorite build is to use add ons to shorten the time of the stun 
---
(I think I use those though tbh I don‚Äôt really use them a lot since it‚Äôs easy enough to track them)
---
And use whatever perks you want but have stbfl 
---
Hitting while in power counts towards stbfl even if you double hit and get that short stun
---
He‚Äôs a m1 killer and getting his hits to go as fast as possible is amazing 
---
Perks to consider: bambooz spirit fury enduring and ruin (to slow the game down just a little bit)
---
number one cuz he's the newest so the phunnest to use til he's not the newest, and since we gotta get his trophies, whatever they shall be. though its hard to beat the phun of vomiting on individuals. especially when u have one bodyblocked
---
Omae wa Hope!

YES, I've been having these insta saves happening very frequently lately. 
---
Of course I'm going to come back? There's a reason there's extra points for safe unhooking.
---
In the end your goal is to get kills on hooks
---
I don‚Äôt personally play hag but the countless plays I‚Äôve seen with her there‚Äôs always one trap near the hook.  
---
If you feel like you won‚Äôt get a down for a while or feel like you might not even get a kill without tunnel then do it 
---
Placing traps ain‚Äôt camping if your goin out looking for others
---
Survivors will complain about dying it‚Äôs just how it is and killers will complain about not getting kills
---
BIRD UP üê¶
---
But you said nobody really plays anymore, lobbies wouldn't instantly fill in the first place.
---
The Cult of the Hag would like to know your location.
---
Your job as killer is to kill survivors, not make them tea and crumpets and then do their laundry. kill em all.
---
Living up to the Bubba hype lol.
---
If I had to guess, 2 PM EST.
---
if im playing survivor, i teabag other survivors on hook before saving them. gotta assert dominance as an invisible claudette.
---
Or you could just git guud or quit and go play civilization 6
---
I wonder if the anniversary event will also start at that time.
---
I do the best with sensitivity at 25. Also, strafe into the shot with left stick rather than flick right stick, makes aiming much more predictable.
---
Man your a ripe cunt aren't ya. Two posts in a row and your just being a dick for no reason. Why not just take a break from the internet for the day and take some time to relax because your clearly not in a good mood. Is everything all right with you? You need someone to talk to?
---
That's when the Bloodhunts ends, so most likely.
---
Just play wraith with windstorm and the addon that makes you uncloak faster. Then run Ruin, sloppy butcher, bloodhound, and the ability that increases your fov, survivors will be too surprised by you uncloaking to not get away withought being smacked once, re-cloak and suddenly your a nascar that can see pools of blood with no effort, who can also see everything around them. Or just run coxcombed clapper red addon and "the ghost" grey addon. No noise when uncloaking, then no terror radius or red stain after uncloaking for 6 seconds, its disgusting, but I love every second of it. The perk with this though is that you CAN ALWAYS LEAVE PEOPLE WHEN YOU HOOK THEM. Regardless if they pull them off right away it doesn't matter. The amount of games I have won by hooking each and every survivor 3 times is insane, once you find them and smack them, they will never get away. So they can't complain about you camping, simply because you never need to be anywhere near the hooked person. You move so fast when cloaked and uncloak so fast no one can escape, i love this build and I use it all the time
---
I mean first off this thread is literally about someone being unhooked in front of you. If you can't find the unhooker there, you are fucking garbage frankly.
---
Second, I don't usually bother to return to the hook at high ranks because I'm going to win without tunneling, so to me the obvious answer is "I down and hook the new person I found in my patrol." More and more I think killers on this sub are just bad if they have to resort to tunneling before rank 7 or so, and even then it's still only against the swf teams that it's actually required.
---
one of them still could've started a party or saw eachother first and started farming
---
Killers function the same on PC and console. The difference is how optimized each platform is when playing this game. Nurse is used more on PC because the frames are better. As for kill rates, Nurse is probably used a lot but not very successful because people can't play her properly. It's very rare to find a skilled Nurse on console, let alone a Nurse at all.  Skill based Killers get lower kill rates because people don't know how to properly play them, thus Killers who require less skill to learn are more common and get more kills. Clown is the exception because hardly anyone plays Clown because people find him to be dull to play.

Om nom nom nom

It‚Äôs a crime the hag didn‚Äôt get one.
---
If someone yoinks my shit I'll let them die on hook so i can get it back.
---
Is joke
---
It's especially frustrating when the survivor that you hooked sticks around after being saved only to get downed and hooked again, which is then followed by the "stop tunneling" message... Am I suppose to turn a blind eye and let him carry on with his day?
---
You of all people should know what an honor it is to die by her hands.

Not America

Sure do love me some, ‚ÄúKillers are so bad, you suck at killer lol, uninstall, you, *insert expletive and racist remarks here!*‚Äù while I‚Äôm letting them win and trying my best to help them and I farm more points out, but the second you go, ‚ÄúAlright, play times over, time to end this like the last Chucky ended the entire franchise so now they have to do a remake.‚Äù

According to the reddit, the scheduled release time is 2pm EST (7pm BST).
---
Me right now basically. Want to play vigeo giem but Killer queues take 3 years and Survivor teammates are all mentally handicapped.
---
Clearly the messed up audio confused him, he couldn't tell if the guy was still running in a circle or not.
---
When I play survivor, I chill at the gate as long as there's other survivors out in the map. There's few things as disappointing as being the survivor getting chased when the gates open, getting caught and hooked, and then seeing the other survivors just leave without even attempting a rescue. If the killer wants me to leave before my teammates are safe then he's gotta chase me out.
---
When I'm playing killer I chase people out if I see them near open gates. 
---
It's never been something that requires any more thought to it than that for me.
---
Spirit, plague, legion although he‚Äôs weak as shit.
---
Hah, it's okay. Got a link to the source?
---
Sassygurl seriously sounds like one of the most toxic survivors on this sub based on her replies to this post
---
Iron Skin + Brutal Strength .....
---
ive never messaged someone before either, and i watched the match they did the same to every survivor and gave the meg the hatch
---
Survivors: *See an innocent meme talking about the Killer player experience.*
---
Survivors: ENTITLED KILLER MAIN MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP BITCHING ABOUT SURVIVORS BEING OP AND LEARN TO PLAY SO WE DON'T ALL QUIT THE GAME.
---
Right?   I feel like they tea bag a lot which ends with them getting camped a lot and they‚Äôre just salty about it.
---
Maybe im just missing why is it unbalanced?
---
yeah I get what he was going for with the post I just wanted to rant lmao
---
Lemme guess, it was one of the porn subreddits?
---
Where from me want mod
---
I find it funny that you're getting downvoted. Must be some of those complainers in here lurking.
---
They really don't, it take a few seconds to find 4 that's most likely a Survivor that just DC'd.
---
What if the next survivor you find runs you back to the hook, then runs you around the hook until you down them near the hook?
---
In that common scenario, were you camping?
---
After his buffs, I'm actually kind of excited to give him a go. Of course, if the update includes nerfs, I'll be holding off to make sure it's not another Plague situation but otherwise, he looks like a lot of fun currently.  
---
Got the 1 million BP ready, don't disappoint BHVR!
---
Not true. As killer everybody has a good time dying in my trial. If they don‚Äôt die they have even more fun. Fun on fun crime.
---
Why do people make that garbage?  And why do people visit them? Morbid curiosity?

Scarred Hand is really fun if you're goal is to hook people in the basement. I've had a lot of salty survivors with that play.
---
Personally I love the spirit and think she‚Äôs a great choice. Fun play style and she has some good perks. Other wise the pig is fun to play with and I enjoy legion.  The cannibal is eh but had some great teachable perks.
---
I submitted a ticket...haven't heard anything back. LOL!
---
You can still bloodlust.  They‚Äôre not going to leave the pallet. So just stick close by to the wall and follow them. I do it to them all the time. I suppose it only works better when you have the one hit down‚Äôs on your side.
---
When I play killer (which is rarely) I tunnel anyone that wastes pallets. I hate people that do that. I even watched one dude just throwing them down not in a chase so I face camped him on the hook
---
What good perks do plague and lesion have
---
She was like 14 when the Entity took her, I think they starved, flayed, and ate her while they had her captured which would explain why she looks the way she does.
---
It starts another chase that the survivor gets more points for escaping from. And if the killer is chasing that survivor through the exit, it gives other survivors still in the map a better chance at getting out themselves.
---
Sure some people do it just to troll, but there are legitimate reasons to force the killer to push survivors through the exit.
---
People have fetishes. The less you ask, the better you will be. So stay away from that stuff unless you want to see shit that will haunt you for as long as you play this game
---
I'm looking for both fun and good perks,I'll buy spirit with irdecent
---
At purple ranks I see a good amount of Bubbas who don't camp. Xbox doesn't totally go along with the same stereotypes. It does happen every now and then but not as much as you may think
---
iron skin shouldn't be a hex
---
This is so accurate!
---
I know how goddamn old this comment / post is, but thank you for the Actual advice, just saying "Run smAlL gAmE" isnt helpful enough, however using your strategy in a game i Just played stopped a noed myers, i saw the person on last gen as i was on the 4th totem and right as the gen pops, bam noed gone. Thank you for not being condescending
---
I have no clue. I just got the game last week. I'm just echoing what I've been reading for the last few days.
---
Don‚Äôt do that
---
Don‚Äôt give me hope
---
I love when one of my teammates taunts the killers at the exit and then they get smacked down and put on a hook for getting too cocky lol. I just leave them there, you deserve that at that point.
---
‚ÄúDude you camped all game‚Äù
---
Me: you were already at the hook when I hooked them
---
‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre supposed to give survivors another chance‚Äù
---
Even with Bamboozle a M1 killer won't be able to get the survivor without breaking god pallet.
---
When the survivors open exit gates and are all able to escape i just walk away and go do something else in the map (break any pallets that didnt get broken, if i'm playing plague i spray everything to get the contagion bp, etc) Either they leave before endgame collapse or they run after me and potentially end up getting downed/dying to EGC timer. If that happens, they have no one but themselves to blame.
---
We can only hope right? Also spirit would be badass
---
At least hills are still a thing.
---
Down him, grab him and hook him. The most important thing to not camp is following survivors. If they come back to the hook it's not ur fault.
---
I find people who use ds they get unhooked I try find the person who unhooked them but they run right at then I just look at them
---
What the fuck region are you playing in? Antarctica West? Outside of the Bloodhunt my Killer queue times are like 5 minutes at most. Usually way less or even flat out instant.
---
And as someone who considers himself a 50/50 player the reason I've stopped playing Survivor is because my teammates are trash. I think the reason you keep dying as Survivor is not because the filthy Killer mains keep demanding nerfs but simply because you're bad. And it's players like you who run around the entire map 8 times looking for Ruin and then complain about gens not being done that's killing the experience for other Survivors.
---
It's a two-way street. Killers need to stop demanding Survivor nerfs just because they lost but you need to stop demanding nerfs because you died with Mettle of Man, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, and SWF babysitting you on Haddonfield.
---
This is why devour soap is good
---
She should get something like the trappers with all the wooden spikes coming out of his back!
---
Umm, where have you been? People DC a lot against Billies and Nurses. Especially good ones
---
Yeah but you only need to see the aura for a second or two, they can't see you coming either.
---
I forgot, my bad.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been playing a lot of leatherface. So I forgot about almost every killer needing special requirement add ons or hex‚Äôs to get one hit downs.  FeelsBadMan
---
Don't ask me. I am team Pig all the way. Too biased to awnser.
---
Hmm yes I think I'd pay money to beat survivors to death with a fish as wraith
---
I consider it trap camping, to me camping is how long it takes to reach the hook. Since Hag teleports I consider it camping even though your nowhere near since in 1 second your back at the hook. I never trap the hook, I trap where I think the rescuer will go afterwards. That‚Äôs just me though, there is nothing wrong with trapping the hook. It‚Äôs easy enough to avoid hags trap with a flashlight or crouching, and every survivor expects a trap at the hook. Just don‚Äôt go after the person who was on the hook (that‚Äôs tunneling), get the rescuer. Once all gens are done all bets are off, do whatever you want. Nothin like giving Eskimo kisses with a hooked survivor that can see an open gate :)
---
You are welcome to play however you want. It‚Äôs a game after all. Have fun.
---
I've seen so many nooblet survivors that think that I don't know they're right next to the hooked guy. I'll fake moving 5 feet away, double back, and easily get two hits or more. 
---
Also, the classic "oh, if I'm getting chased by the killer, I better run past and unhook the survivor!" strat that survivors STILL think is anywhere a decent idea. Seriously.
---
I dont think it's worth it to buy 1 killer just for some little perk
---
Yeap i got pretty much on P3 and i don't know what to play -.-
---
You don't need a Survivior to run OoO to find them. With how prevalent anti stealth perks are and how strong she is with them, OoO is just an unnecessary piece. Besides if you run prayer beads it actually fucks you over even more bc they can OoO onto ur husk and if they see you holding still they'll know ur phasing and they can plan accordingly
---
20‚Ç¨ no wonder we're not getting it. I would take a loan and bankrupt myself for this skin
---
What if the Xenomorph's ability was a jump? Just one big leap that let him cut a loop in half by leaping over a low wall, maybe use it to catch up to survivors, etc. Landing directly on top of a survivor with a charged leap could be a one hit down, while if you miss then there is a fatigue cooldown to stop it from being OP. You can make it so the killer can't alter their course once they initiate the jump so that survivors can have some counterplay (just like vanilla nurse blinks). On smaller/ indoor maps it naturally struggles cause ceilings, but Maybe add a wall cling as well so the killer can wait above a hallway and drop down on unsuspecting megs.
---
I just want another mobile killer so we can run down survivors instead of lightly jogging after them.
---
I had a Meg drop shack pallet while I was looping it. We were both healthy with 4 gens left, she didn‚Äôt even get the stun...
---
I hear ya man, but you won‚Äôt see BBQ on the shrine for a very long time. If you plan on playing killer seriously at all, you‚Äôre really gonna want BBQ. It‚Äôs not so much for the aura reading, but for the BP bonus.
---
While reading this post I got facecamped on first hook with all the other survivors on the other side of the map (and I wasn't even toxic)
---
If I was playing dbd and saw this chasing me, I'd probably die laughing. It's so fucking cute
---
Oof
---
It wasn't before. It kind of is now.
---
Careful, he'll stab your ankles.
---
Some people don't understand how canon works.
---
The Jake *yeeeeea* wiggle noise would‚Äôve worked well too
---
counters NOED
---
I'd say stop feeling pressured to perform and get kills every single game and you'll be much more relaxed playing killer as a whole.
---
Same goes for Survivors trying to survive every game. Do stupid shit and have fun.
---
Ah, alright, thank you.
---
I‚Äôm a red ranked killer, so I think I‚Äôm perfectly fine skill wise. The issue is that fully decked out SWF teams are a pain to deal with and make a match exponentially harder. Why would I elect to play against a team that has an innate unfair advantage?
---
If you don't mind me asking what would you say your play style is. Jake's perks go good for more stealthy players so maybe distortion from Jeff would be a good fit or urban evasion from Nea
---
Yeah I never feel bad for those surviviors.
---
no
---
Prob still wouldn‚Äôt be that balanced cause most killers camp once the exit gates are opened
---
No, my point was more that Spirit is a good killer to have if someone is running OoO as you can beeline straight to them.
---
I'm not saying you NEED them to have it. I don't use Prayer Beads all that often as they make the game a bit too easy. I like using the Purple lunge addon (w/e the name is) with either +duration or +speed.
---
Best show on TV!
---
Hag higher than huntress.....you got a weird taste
---
you wanna get a kyf going to test these in game?
---
I just want an in depth lore/character section. Maybe something detailing the cosmetics of the killers and survivors.
---
Tbh they‚Äôre both in ‚ÄòNope‚Äô categories, just for different reasons.
---
Do you think people who gen rush will go away by then? I doubt it.
---
Haha don‚Äôt worry about it üòÇ hopefully they get back to us soon and I hope you get the compensation you deserve!
---
Like what? Tinkering with a reverse bear trap in her hand or something?
---
This is awful. From a survivor perspective they'd be better off just making NOED baseline for ALL killers. Not a perk. The issue with it at the moment is you've got no way of knowing if the killer has it. If all killers had it then everyone would go for totems, and it would actually delay the game a little bit and give a second objective, which the game is in need of I think. Personally I always go for totems because why wouldn't you?
---
I'd actually love to try them out. Everything is theoretical at the moment, so anything could happen.
---
Climbed my way to Sabertooth I.   I just want to say that if DbD killer mains think survivors are strong, they will appreciate it after the cancer that is IDV's serious survivor bias.
---
Just cleanse dull totems lmao
---
Let's hope!
---
I have yelled at the TV in pure frustration as I see my rando teammate get me off the hook before the heartbeat has even faded. Sometimes when the killer is starting to walk away. 
---
"No you dumbass!"
---
And then I'm either dropped there or I'm found quickly after the killer got the "rescuer. 
---
And then the DCs... Constant now (on Xbox)  I wish there was a bigger penalty for dropping out of trails.
---
It's flaired as a "Shitpost".
---
It really is a shame we can't  have 4 purples stack lmao
---
heres your downvote bro
---
Read the last part of my post :(
---
See I don‚Äôt know what that means
---
love the concept, but the traps and being able to teleport to set locations seems exactly like the new freddy rework
---
They were worried that people would use it to track survivors by watching their progression while they wandered around. This came at the same time they nerfed Legion, and they essentially wanted to just make deep wounds an inconvenience rather than an actual threat. Since BT uses the same effect, it was also buffed at the same time.
---
I think that Plague would look **godly** if she had hallowed blight cosmetics
---
Yea I read it, I wasn't mad or insulting you, sorry if it came across that way. I just think it's a bad idea generally. Just a difference of opinions and thought I'd add my thoughts on it :)
---
Oh that makes sense then.
---
But how else will survivors know true terror? Nothing is scarier than running for the exit gate only to teleport across the map, slam a pallet that you weren‚Äôt trying to interact with, and then get moried by Myers.
---
Jeff‚Äòs aftercare is pretty neat
---
remember that enduring and brutal strength exist. The only reason this perk can be stronger than those two is because its a hex.
---
so NOED is a survivor perk now?
---
A shitpost, is funny simply because it isn't a predictable repetition of an existing form of post and is within context of the current situation or event.
---
There shouldn't be any reason why getting it in kyf would be difficult right? We would only need one or two survivors and just coordinate. I'm down if you are after im off work
---
Looks like a normal post game chat tbh
---
Every successful hit on anyone who isn‚Äôt the obsession (frenzy or basic) shortens the successful hit animation      You get up to 8 stacks and loose 2 for every hit on the obsession. 
---
You don‚Äôt gain stacks once the obsession is dead.   But grabbing doesn‚Äôt count as a hit therefore none lost none Gained. 
---
Basically use normal and frenzy attacks to get 8 stacks and then ditch the frenzy unless you need to vault as you‚Äôll be hitting so fast they won‚Äôt be able to get away
---
This doesn‚Äôt count to missed hits and they will still get that speed boost but that doesn‚Äôt usually matter
---
Oh ok
---
I play both sides. This is 6000% true as killer and as survivor I really wish my team mates would do gens so the killer HAS to leave.
---
If you just unhook (without BT) near the killer, any camping or tunnelling is your fault.
---
Thanks, I hate that I love it
---
My brothers, share a word or 2 to prevent our down friend from joining the ranks of those despicable survivors 
---
Together we the HOOKERS shall sacrifice em all

I never said it was special. Just there for the one who decides that this is a good... decent read.

Oh I see. Carry on then
---
Maybe. It would be cool though.
---
Baby Claudette on the right
---
Lovely.
---
It was desync. The game thought he kept running towards Bubba when he was coming around the corner, and dragged him back there once it caught up.
---
new players dont even know what their perks do yet, let alone how to counter them..
---
One of the more interesting salt chats I've read thats for sure
---
Le "why don't you attempt to escape off hook?" has arrived.
---
I found these message are funny and I want to share since this is my first experience playing the game.
---
Thats not true at all.
---
these fucking morons who do this
---
You‚Äôre the MVP
---
the way you continued healing her after the missed hatchet got me XD
---
Maximum oof. Yeah, gotta love pubbies.
---
I‚Äôve become a killer main Over the weekend.  With BBQ it‚Äôs hard not to XD
---
I have not found a single farming lobby on xbox as survivor. Every game I get 3 survivors who just loop the killer while I do gens, or hide in lockers while I loop the killer, they usually all die then I either get the hatch or die. I'm rank 11 as survivor so idk if that has anything to do with it.
---
What rank are you at? One of the most important things I've learned as a spirit main is that her tactics vary drastically with rank; low rank players are much easier to catch (they'll generally just run bc they don't understand her mechanics as well) but ironically much harder to mind game for the exact same reason. After a reset, there'll be many situations where I feel like I'm gonna be a boss ass bitch and pretend to be phasing so they come toward me, but instead they just keep sprinting away bc they don't know spirit mechanics.

The other basic tip I'd give is that, esp while you're learning her, do NOT use your phasing to get a first hit. If you do, you'll have to wait for it to cool while they gain a lot of ground (which is extra horrible w no add-ons). Instead, try to sneak up and get the first hit manually. That way, their speed boost from taking damage will effectively be negated by your ability to immediately phase, and they'll be way easier to track while phasing due to their moaning. 
---
Good luck! Spirit is great.
---
As a Nurse main yes please run OoO :)
---
Then have a nice bitter and sad life full of hate. hopefully you will become a better person some day. :)
---
Filthy Frank would have been perfect

omfg i was late to notice the chair and the first thing that pop'd into my mind was 
---
***Damn  Pleakley  about to eat Lilos ASS***
---
Seeing them all grouped up together like that when you got the 3 saw made me think of the Mystery Machine gang trying to rescue Daphne only to get found by the bad guy
---
What is Bhvr
---
Jesus, I figured that a lot of the shard availability was going to be the simple common re-skins but holy hell, if you exclude them only *44 percent*? That seems low to me. I'm no numbers person though so I don't know. 
---
Really feels like I'm saving up shards for nothing, because there's either never anything good or it's just with cells.
---
This is true I main claudette I expect this every game i dont take it personally
---
&gt; but ironically much harder to mind game for the exact same reason.
---
That feeling when the survivor runs straight across the entire map and you just mind gamed yourself.
---
my issue is when i see it maxed i just need to spend it all
---
i'm glad i have enough strength to keep myself outta the casinos
---
...how much BP
---
Yes love the left outfit with the long hair and bangs for feng, been wanting hair like that .
---
Thanks, it was new to me.
---
chainsaw
---
hatchet
---
tombstone
---
Be like cool glove bruh
---
Double if you hook all 4 survivors at least once. So you can turn 32k points into 64k points if you had BBQ on. It‚Äôs why most killers religiously run it.
---
Plot twist: we get Joseph instead.
---
404 
---
be like
---
sorry this does not exist
---
It grants points and emblem, sounds like a objective to me
---
I thought it was the 19th?!
---
Big Brain Game
---
Making Iron Skin a Hex Perk dhows great balancing skills. Props.
---
If you can get Laurie strode she‚Äôs a good survivor
---
maybe if it were relegated to an add-on I could get behind that. But due to how easy it is to constantly have multiple people in exposed status, perhaps a debuff to the exposed survivor of some sort, like exhaustion or hindered.
---
That is great.
---
All of it looks incredible! I would actually love to see this in the game.
---
You dared to make a point about killers on Reddit. You are brave. Also aren't you a killer main?
---
If you‚Äôre going for stealth I‚Äôd trade ds for lightweight but otherwise it‚Äôs a good stealth loadout
---
There‚Äôs no point staying at 1mil to then keep playing. Otherwise you‚Äôre just losing out on BP
---
I too climbed to saber tooth and #8 geisha main, she‚Äôs the only one I can win with it I run end game perks and camp the first kill. It‚Äôs a cash grab game but fun in lower ranks
---
ye I was looking to do a stealth build/ being able to free myself if the chance comes
---
What a cutie
---
Claudette:  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll thank me when NOED doesn‚Äôt activate!‚Äù
---
(Everyone is killed before the third gen pops.)
---
Claudette:  ‚Äú...You‚Äôre welcome!‚Äù
---
A üëèüèª killer üëèüèª is üëèüèª not üëèüèª a üëèüèª scumbag üëèüèª for üëèüèª camping üëèüèª. This applies to any rank. Facecamping is a legitimate, albeit terrible strategy. If you tunnel/camp viciously the whole game, you deserve 1 kill. If a team of survivors cathes on or even plays normally (i.e 1 person go for save, others stay on gens) there will be *no map pressure* from the killer. 1 kill and 3 survive is a victory for survivors, even if the tunneled survivor doesn‚Äôt get much for it. If you play on a team, a victory for your team should feel rewarding.
---
Also, while getting tunneled/camped can be discouraging for new survivors, so too can teabagging discourage new killers.
---
I've already spent shards on all the cosmetics I'm interested in. Only maybe good one left for me is Macmillan Miner, and I've only bought 3 Very Rare sets for killers. To have just 4 sets of cosmetics available through shards that I'm interested in feels pretty lackluster.
---
I‚Äôm that case I‚Äôd trade calm spirit for something like deliverance but it‚Äôs still a good build
---
The detail is amazing, everyone would fit in game so well.
---
I only do that if they‚Äôre not toxic during the match, do more than hide while teammates are downed lol
---
Laurie has decisive strike which is really useful.
---
you had me at survivors complain
---
Different for each platform or not? Xbox always gets stuff like 2 weeks late.
---
I suggest u watch your attitude before I fucking hurt u
---
Except it's about to be worthless
---
Showed my friend the game he looped the poor perk less wraith his first game, granted hes watches play alot. Was a happy moment, he even got shirtless David cause he said he wants to get chased alot lol. What have I done
---
I deranked from 8 to 15 just so i don't have to sweat my fucking balls on with Ghost Face
---
If I could upvote twice I would.
---
When you're the killer and see a survivor cleansing a dull totem and you're not running NOED
---
At least your post won‚Äôt get taken down for ‚Äúannoying post game chat‚Äù. This is pretty funny
---
Yeah I really don‚Äôt understand why the devs are so adamant about Ghostface being a chapter instead of a paragraph, maybe they have a few surprises coming along with him?
---
LMAO
---
Who would eat rotten food?
---
Lightweight. Because a kilogram of steel is heavier than a kilogram of feathers.
---
Holy shit I never would've noticed it if you didn't say anything. I love that he's just breaking the 4th wall and just staring at you
---
I ALWAYS run distortion, Urban, and Spine chill. I switch out my fourth perk between Self Heal, Quick and Quiet, or Sole Survivor.
---
What killer were you? Seems to always happen to me when I‚Äôm spirit on PS4
---
No doge dont thats mean üò•
---
Legion
---
[**C A R L T H E C A S H I E R**](/intensifies)
---
Makes since actually. Legion still causes a lot of salt dcs even though he‚Äôs arguably as bad as Freddy.
---
&gt;Any t.tv people 
---
I'll admit I just flat out back out of a lobby if I see [T.TV](https://T.TV) in their name. But that's more of me not wanting to get made fun of on stream for being bad than being worried about a SWF group.
---
Fully BS. But obviously if you wanted to gain ranks, you'd go against better killers. /s
---
More seriously, it's stupid that the devs have completely detached win/loss from the ranking mechanic. It's a terrible idea, and produces situations like this where you "win", but are still told by the game that you did poorly.
---
I'm All Ears got a heckin buff actually. It now does its aura reveal if a surv fast vaults within 48 meters of your location, terror radius be fucked.

I‚Äôve had some okay luck with him. I need to level Freddy up for that rework but I‚Äôm saving for Ghostface

Literally no one cares what you think, you don't represent the opinion of skilled players

Sentinel and Hamstring seem god tier on legion

In the distance you hear a survivor getting moried "it's finger licken good"

---
I don't understand the joke
---
Ash was actually called a chapter but it didn't count for the roman numerals so I guess he was a chaptergraph
---
my nea is level 1
---
I get it though. Loads of survivors are toxic but loads of killers are too. I am a solo queue survivor and see it from both sides. My luck with killers has been pretty good lately though!
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
If you want to finish the game faster, then why are you playing it in the first place? It's worse even. You finish the game faster with less points, then you have to sit on a queue again, hope no one dc's and you get a nice killer that doesn't face camp (gl with that btw).  
---
So, why not take advantage of the 2x BP for only 3 days? Is that too much to ask? xD I dont get it.
---
Wait ghostface comes out tomorrow?
---
Damn. Now I really want to see stomp. It's been years since I've thought about them
---
I play both sides but my survivor game is absolute garbage, so I just mainly stick to what I'm good at
---
Honestly no other survivors are worth buying. Just get ghostface if you play killer. If not, save the money
---
I just spent ten to fifteen minutes waiting for a game to start, only for someone on MacDonalds wifi to disconnect and end the match...
---
THANKS BHVR!
---
Hopefully you will learn one day that nobody cares about your opinion me.
---
I'm on xbox and I play Hag.  I'm still new so obviously I have to defer to more experienced players on higher levels. 
---
Hag on all levels I've played (not great) is almost boring to play.  I read an advanced strategy guide on stream and it just seems no one that plays survivor can really deal with it.
---
I've played a little as Trapper and honestly I have no clue how people do it.   My experience with the Hag made Trappers trap placement easier to optimize but he's just no match for her in map control.   
---
As a survivor I've never played a Hag that knew what they were doing.  They'd spend massive amounts in time chasing and never catching anyone. 
---
Trapper has owned me because I always fall for the hook camping, always.  It's like I completely forget to just go do gens.
---
Doctor on xbox seems to be the best I've faced so far though.  His AOE is just plain mean and even if he doesnt kill everyone it feels like he just couldn't be bothered as opposed to not being able to catch us.  His score would be huge and all he did was mess with us the whole game.
---
Billy and Leatherface I've never seen on xbone.
---
I'm only good at playing Myers but when I do I just go to farm now. lol

Youre really upset over 8%?
---
Ruin at rank 15 LMAI
---
If the trap was placed after the last gen popped, the trap will not trigger when walking through the gate.
---
I play Wraith and Billy and I'm planning on picking up Spirit because I hear she's really good and I've been playing only two killers since like 2017 lol
---
Shut up and take my Auric Cells!
---
Doenst she have some like the others?
---
You can bring back survivors with the key?
---
I'm missing something
---
Probably not, but maybe it won't sting so much when you aren't pressuring yourself to get as many BPS as possible in as short a time as possible to deal with BHVR's absolute insane and unrealistic grind they expect of players.
---
Did anyone actually get in to this? Haven‚Äôt seen anything about it since the last sign-ups
---
Nah she just looks around.
---
If they didnt finish the gens I always give the last one hatch
---
as i said before camping can be a very good stratigy in some situations
---
Those three make me cry the saltiest tears. üòÇüòÇüòÇ they're really tough to counter and escape. If you see a Nea turn in a circle and surrender, that's probably me.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt go easier on them just because they‚Äôre newer in my opinion. After the game you should tell them little tips and trick on how to improve and better themselves on the game, and tell them what they did wrong and how to work on it, without being really rude about it.
---
What is this format called?
---
I like it. If you're using Distortion to strictly counter BBQ &amp; Chili then I'd swap it for something else since you can just hide in a locker/behind a gen to hide your aura.
---
My go to stealth build is Iron Will, Urban Evasion, Calm Spirit, and Premonition.
---
If you look around a lot to proc Premonition, they'll rarely be able to find you.
---
That sounds pretty cool.
---
You might want to consider purchasing a DLC pack. They can contain both a killer and a survivor, and come out at a lower cost than buying them separately.
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
The emblem system is really stupid. In that case if you want to pip you need to keep entering and leaving the Killer's terror radius. If you do it correctly you will be credited with many chase victories and can build up that emblem
---
You know you can dump points and get perks without actually playing the killer right?
---
Jesus...and I said damn...this community are pretty nice
---
Good build, controversial but if you really care about winning then swap calm spirit for mettle of man
---
i was farming :(
---
Agreed. Killers who just sit there and stare at you as soon as you're hooked and never leave are just bad killers. Killers who punish people who immediately unhook a survivor in their face are just normal killers, and the Survivor who decided to farm his teammate is a glutton for punishment.
---
Noooooook
---
A key can turn a 4K into a 1k easily. Just yesterday my team 3 genned ourselves against a Doc. There was no way all of us we escaping that match, but luckily someone was already dead and another guy brought a key. Turned an easy 3/4K into a 1k.
---
gotta go fast
---
Killer has no respect for the meme.
---
Is not any different on console I‚Äôve even looked up legit ways to derank fast recently. I mean you‚Äôll derank playing against a decent swf but you‚Äôll eventually hit limbo and be stuck doing good every other round ranking up and then de ranking
---
Thanks.
---
Thank you.
---
Except it's pretty easy to tell when Spirit is phasing with OoO and in a general sense if you know she's phasing you should always assume she's phasing after you. 
---
And if you run prayer beads, OoO hurts you more than it helps you. This is bc instead of the Survivior not knowing ur phasing until ur grabbing him off a gen, they know ur phasing the second you start phasing. This gives them more time to prepare for your arrival. 
---
And the purple lunge add on is the Wakizashi Saya
---
I‚Äôm sure it would work like noed/MoM and only apply to basic M1 attack‚Äôs
---
what's sandbagging?
---
I want a Dr Gordon with a limp
---
wooooosh noises gets louder
---
It makes knowing where to blink so much easier
---
This happened to me yesterday. A random disconnected during the loading screen the second the killer's offering didn't flip. Turns out it was just a shroud of separation XD
---
Idk, I just sorta knew of this pic a while ago and tried to search for it, than captioned it
---
Tomorrow
---
Ok then. Thanks anyways
---
Ah, you must have been the Claudette
---
Ash Williams came out as a survivor and has an op perk known mettle of man (its getting nerfed though)
---
Enduring is getting nerfed
---
Sounds are still broken
---
Freddy rework coming after a month and a half
---
Map reworks coming soon
---
Ghostface from screem coming tomorrow
---
3 year anniversary live stream
---
There's probably some stuff I missed but this is most of the important stuff
---
not trying to be an ass or something but why Spirit Fury when you're better off using Corrupt Intervention?
---
The male pig stands to reason (Zepp maybe), no idea where the red ghost face came from though. I don't remember that from the movies.
---
Simple. Don't be near it.
---
Yeah, it looks pretty cute.
---
I hear ya.  I was in that limbo at like rank 5-7 before recent reset.  I started reset to 16 from rank 1 both sides but that‚Äôs 3 resets.  Got to rank 8 survivor and rank 6 killer before the most resent rank reset.  I guess I missed an update where they changed pips again.
---
Ghost face is coming out today?!
---
Already been used
---
Official DBD forum, it can't be fake
---
The Steam store page for Ash doesn't explicitly say if he's a Paragraph or a Chapter, and official BHVR communication is notoriously inconsistent on these things.
---
I'm fairly certain teachables always show up at the level they are unlockable
---
I've escaped a fair share of games this way. Depending on hatch and exit gate placement it can become a 50/50 as to which gate a survivor goes to and most killers don't have the mobility to check both fast enough. Though I do agree that 9 times out of 10 your way is foolproof.
---
It sets a precedent that DLCs in the future could have less content.
---
Prisoner's dilemma. Look it up.
---
How were the gates powered while you did not touch a single gen?
---
Strider helps me plenty. 9/10 games result in a 4K minus hatch escapes here and there
---
Sir, are you recovering well from your 4 week coma?
---
Hoffman and Gordon skins for Pig when
---
dropping pallets on your teammates to try and get them killed
---
Hence why I said it looks legit, I don't throw that word around like most people. Still, since when? Haven't they kind of made it a point to not add cosmetics for the licensed killers? Is this maybe a sign of some more to come? I'd be pretty hyped to see the rest of the licensed characters get more cosmetics
---
I thought the game objective was babysitting?
---
Its because this ghostface isn't the one from the movies DBD just got his mask, not the license for scream hence why we didn't get Sydney.
---
That's a pretty trashy move
---
That‚Äôs... pretty gross...
---
I only saw the first one recently, and really only because this scream DLC got me thinking that I've never seen them before
---
Only if your under rank 13 lmao
---
i got you fam
---
Well, at least Myers didn't take my TV.
---
No, you gotta say gg then wait like 10 seconds and then say ez
---
Well - you would be wrong. It may be a SECONDARY objective, but a necessary objective it is not. Where as the killer literally has to fail his main objective for noed to even come into play. That being stop generators and kill survivors before the gates are opened. There's a reason killers get penalized in the emblem system the more gens are done.
---
Ghostface is still gonna be only 5 dollars, like any stand alone character.  I still don't see the issue.
---
It's almost as if rank reset was 4 days ago. It's also almost as if ruin is the most popular perk in the game and easily attainable.
---
I mean, I take extended breaks from this game pretty often. I came back when I saw the youtube videos for the Scream DLC. So yeah, the licensed character cosmetics are new to me, and you didnt answer my question; Since when is this a thing? I thought there was an issue with the fact that they didnt own the characters or something, that prevented them from adding cosmetics like they apparently are now. (I think I heard that from a friend, so dont spit on me if its not true)
---
Two weeks of PTB seems about par for most content.
---
Now imagine 
---
If they charge full 9.99 for less content later on 
---
or move on into charging for maps but nobody being able to play on em due to no one buying it
---
Here we go again.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c1t8r9/ghostface_release_18th_june_estimated_at_2pm/
---
That's an interesting loophole. I wonder if BHVR will add the tongue mask, or if they would need to obtain some kind of rights from Scary Movie
---
The point is that they're most likely new to the game and have no idea the uselessness of the perk in *most* situations. It's like a kid touching a stove not knowing it's hot you gotta feel bad for them because they don't know any better
---
Even without corrupt purge the broken effect plus their constant coughing makes it so much easier in my experience 
---
When they cleanse it can be a bit irritating mainly because im always worried they'll reset my pools
---
leatherface is the only other one with cosmetics iirc, so it's nice to see this change. maybe we can start holding out hope for shirtless myers now /s
---
Its not Godpallet when you have Bamboozle
---
My teammates were decent players apparently. By the time he caught me, game was over.
---
i dont bother with em till the last couple gens are left, even better if they are close by each other
---
That hasn't happened since the Clown released.
---
Lol
---
Mettle of man made me start playing billy, so... there‚Äôs that.
---
Honestly I'd take an outfit for Laurie where she doesn't look like she's from a PS2 game
---
I admit, my dumbass took a second to realize this was a joke
---
Honestly it should just make you unable to play another game till the one you DC‚Äôd from ended.
---
If you (as the killer) haven‚Äôt moved away from the hook for the past 3 gens and I have borrowed time. Fuck you, I‚Äôm saving him. When I get downed shortly after it‚Äôs not because i got ‚Äúoutsmarted‚Äù and  I‚Äôm ‚Äúselfish‚Äù it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a cunt.
---
Directed at someone, but you get the point
---
DEJA VU
---
Glass Bead add on for the map.
---
There are only two full chapters this year. The other two are paragraphs.
---
Created by another survivor's map. Lets them mark where important thing are. :D
---
Its from a map. Its a beam of light all the survivors can see.
---
Honestly the only "good" argument against shit like Alien and Predator comming to dead by Daylight is lore. The Entity has a considerable record of only choosing humans. But the thing is that doesn't matter. They're licensed DLC, they're not meant to be Canon or fit the lore. Their soul purpose is to bring in new people and make fans happier which = $$$$. I'm sure if they had the chance BHVR would 100% put some Alien/Predator stuff in DbD.
---
If a paragraph can now be called a chapter, what could a future paragraph contain? It could be as small as just adding a few generic perks or a new map, but we'd still have to pay for it.
---
Not a BM, and I have to say, as someone that primarily plays killer, I'd be mad grumpy if it kept happening the whole game, but the first time it happens I just have to accept it as a good play.
---
Doing it the whole game mostly just makes it feel like you're trying to make sure the killer can't play the game, sadly.
---
Or when I walk away from the hook to patrol gens. They get unhooked 15 seconds later, you walk back qnd the unhooked guy runs into you. Like, what the heck? You watched me walk this way when I hooked you!
---
I don‚Äôt get mad at gen rushing, but sometimes it honesty blows my mind how many gens can be done within the first 2 minutes of the game without ruin. It‚Äôs still exactly like you said though it‚Äôs just survivors doing their objective
---
I honestly feel like I'm stalking you at this point I seem to find every comment you make
---
Yeah I know it‚Äôs annoying. Thank you though
