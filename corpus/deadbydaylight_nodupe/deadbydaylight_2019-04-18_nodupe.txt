Are you pissing yourself yet, Ms. Morel?

Legion can no longer spam attack in frenzy like he was originally advertised as being able to do. Legion now has to wait till his power is fully recharged to even use it. If legion misses a frenzy attack he’s knocked out of frenzy. If he actually does manage to land a hit the deep wound is now useless because if the survivors in Legions terror radius the timers paused and oh look at that the terror radius was increased and the timer pauses if the survivor mends so now Legions double fucked because if he chases the survivor deep wounds useless and if he doesn’t they’ll mend instantly making deep wound useless. 
---

---
They literally made his power completely useless. Legion can pretty much just basic attack now.
---
“Huge fuss” is this gamebase’s middle name.
---
That's just the problem. They gave Legion "counterplay" at the complete and utter expense of Lethality.
---
*”I’m an Oxford man you are old sport.”*
---
I honestly didn’t consider this arguing but a normal conversation. If you’re referring to me responding sarcastically to comments that were purposely made to attack me or make me seem like a bad guy for throwing together a legion meme that I made at 5 am for a quick giggle with me and my group chat, I responded to them like that because I don’t care that they’re trying to make it seem like I’m the big bad ‘bully’. I know the community is divided on this issue, originally in the post not once did I ever state my opinion on the nerf/rework. Personally, I could care less because I liked playing against fair legions and had fun with him as a killer.
---
People then started coming in, assuming my position, and either attacking or criticizing me. While I responded to other comments who didn’t tell me to go fuck myself for a meme on the internet maturely, I responded to comments with the intention of antagonizing me sarcastically because I couldn’t give less of a shit what they think of my meme of a character from a video in which people will forget in 24 hours when it’s replaced by ( probably ) another legion meme and my 15 minutes of fame on this subreddit will be over.
---
So basically, yeah I can take criticism. What I don’t take is people shitting on me for no reason for a meme on the internet. And no, we were never arguing. Thanks for taking the time to read my whole ass paragraph if you did, and I hope you have a great one if you choose not to reply.
---
Many changes have been made because of killers complaining. Remember vacuum pallets? Remember instablind flashlights? Remember double and triple pallet placements? Remember no bloodlust or a game with no nurse? Remember how unfair old DS was? Remember old BNP that now got nerfed into uselessness? It's not just survivors complaining, they're responding to their customers.
---
You see, nerf bullets don’t hurt
---
I'm sorry.....positives?
---
Where?
---
BBQ AND CHILI IS IN THE SHRINE WHILE I WORKED AND PAID FOR MY BBQ, AND ALSO EVERY KILLER CAN FIND ME WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR NOW NO JOKE!
---
I HATE BEING FARMED LIKE THAT!
---
EVERY DAMN TIME
---
Using both blade addons causes each consecutive frenzy hit too increase the timer for mending.... It can literally reach up to seven minutes or so.
---
Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg... And my arm... even my fingers... The body I've lost... the comrades I've lost... won't stop hurting... It's like they're all still there. You feel it, too, don't you? I'm gonna make them give back our past!
---
Unce unce unce unce it think I lost the beat but unce unce unce unce
---
MY PC ISN'T TOP OF THE LINE BUT IT SHOULD RUN DBD LIKE BUTTER SO WHY DO I NEVER KNOW WHEN SKILL CHECKS ARE GOING TO STUTTER LIKE HELL AND MAKE ME MISS? THEN THEY SMOOTH OUT ONCE I'VE STARTED COMPENSATING FOR THE STUTTER, MAKING ME MISS AGAIN!
---
Literally people were screaming about deleting the whole character from the game. Big name youtubers talking about how legion itself is a factor making the game unfun and calling for either a total overhaul or deletion. People constantly bitching and bitching and bitching about legion and how uncounterable they are and other bullshit. Now an update comes out where they tried to work on the character a bit and people are screaming 'they went too far!!!! UwU my babies!!!' Jesus Christ
---
LMAO
---
Yeah me too
---
Don't ask me why
---
ARENT NURSES JUST PEACHY SOMETIMES WOW
---
Don't need to test trash to know that it's garbage. It's pretty obvious what it is just by seeing it near a dumpster.
---
Please can we take a moment to appreciate the "bitch" written above freds head?
---
Also - incredible art, you should draw more!
---
It was pretty clearly sarcasm..
---
Billy's new pants look great. 
---
If you combine them with the cowboy hat he looks really nice. Yeehaw c:
---
The stun is still there. The Legion update should make more sense once you get to try it on the PTB... it's not immediately apparent how this stuff all works together from just reading it. :)
---
I literally answered that part in my post?
---
Respond to what? To getting hit? You are already in a chase and have terror radius, you can turn your camera and look at the guy chasing you.
---
What does knowing that the guy is coming do for you in terms of not getting hit? He will just wait for a second so that they don't get spun and hit you.
---
And that just goes to show that even after explaining myself, you don’t care to read it and therefore your opinion doesn’t matter either since you don’t want to have a proper debate with me.
---
lol feelsbadman. happened to me once with 999 ms killer
---
I won't even engage in polite conversation until you follow my instructions.
---
Did that trigger you?
---
Thanks, I regret my purchase now when I bought him the week he came out
---
I forgot how toxic they were. I'm used to just playing in the average ranks but every now and again you boost to the lower ranks and get tunneled to death :/
---
I can't believe i'm having to say this. 
---
I think you've got too many salty tears in your eyes to see an obvious joke.
---
My eyes
---
S a m e
---
I doubt it's "random" at this point
---
Only Legion member I spent shards on
---
Thank you
---
I love it &lt;3
---
Daddy Dwight’s tbags are the best at the end.
---
BHVR probably expected something else than what the current reaction is...
---
It is bad because it takes survivors out of dream which is bad for freddy since survivors in dream will slow the game more than overcharge, and you can hit them
---
I got it like 7 times in a row but I always forget to check names after to see if it's the same killer so I wouldn't be surprised if it was xD
---
I hope it burns
---
Bait is obvious
---
They have loads of Susie art which I love
---
Piss off bad killers.
---
It's not really a strat (at least to my knowledge) it's just a way of being toxic, similar to how survivors will t-bag a killer at a pallet. It offers no strategical advantage and is just a way to be toxic (again, to my knowledge)
---
Probably isnt
---
Neckbeard is obvious
---
Yes god has arrived
---
PogChamp
---
I see no issue with that
---
Bait is now even more obvious
---
No off course there’s not an explanation it’s a glitch
---
i’m glad i’m not the only one who noticed that the doctor is the best killer on corn maps when he has discipline on
---
you ever shock them on that vault at the harvester too? aishhdjdjf free hit boys
---
Maybe
---
I ain't even warming up on them ass cheeks I'm going straight to moby dick
---
Wait so he's fast, has tracking, slows the game down, and can basically get one shot downs if people don't heal...and he's gonna be bottom tier? On paper this looks like if you're a good killer he's going to be better, and if you've been a trashbag moonwalking feral frenzy spammer with no skill...well I guess suck for you :(((((
---
Kinda sad, must be something going on with his life. I hope everything works out for him I really enjoyed his videos
---
Neckbeard is more obvious
---
I already explained why your meme elicited so much warranted criticism.
---
The devs' response is still up to them. It's their fault.
---
This isn't unpopular, nor should it be. It's legitimate. Legion needs 4 hits to down someone and doesn't deserve the 110% movement speed. Those factors alone give what you just said credence.
---
Alright you better shut up before I eat your ass
---
You missed the entire point.....
---
Are you forgetting his black suit? Combine that with the prestige head and boom, hidden.
---
I sometimes run Overcharge + Pop + Surveillance + Discordance on Freddy, works pretty well.
---
lmao nerd
---
And I explained as to why I made it the way I did and why somebody telling me to harm myself for an internet meme is wrong. I think we’re done here.
---
Come at me bubba! 
---
Professor hulk uses starks version of the infinity gauntlet to bring everyone back, captain America uses mjolnir to fight thanos, captain America finally says avengers assemble, and the combined avengers defeat thanos and his army. Also, Stark hugs Peter when he sees him alive for the first time and Peter says "huh, this is nice". We even get a scene During the time travel sequence where the future Captain America fights the past Captain America. The Captain America from the past says "I can do this all day" and the future Captain America says "I know".
---
I've gone against a few Freddy's with Overcharge. It plays against his abilities since it wakes you up but you can still take advantage of the perk. If a survivor tries to be cheeky and keeps blowing up a gen, you can sit there taking turns kicking and blowing it up to revert an almost done gen to zero progression.
---
There are not many confusing vaults tho, they make you know you can vault it. The other confusing one is the little boat in the Swamp and one of the corners in the big boat upstairs. Took me a while to realize it was vaultable. Still forget them from time to time.
---
You is the item
---
I got a huntress too. The first survivor DC'd on her then she went for me and she would run away from the hook to pretend like she's doing something then come back the instant someone pressed unhook and totally ignored the other survivor who was trying to get her to chase them instead and tunneled me 3 times in a row until I died like wow -.-
---
Rename NOED TO NOED (No one Escapes Diabetes)
---
Did mommy send you to your room again, neckbeard? Oh right, you never leave it anyway.
---
When what made him unique was his ability to exploit wins.....that's not really a good thing :/
---
Man, Bills are the best survivor. For me they are polite, good players, helpful.
---
I'm still waiting for a Violator skin for Clown.
---
No kidding. I hate it when people do that
---
Or ghost face skin for legion
---
The speed isn’t that much, and I don’t do a lot of altruism after the exit gates are open. Also, the bloodpoints bonus of NOLB is countered by the 8000 altruism bloodpoints max, whereas WGLF is a post game bonus, so your reward is more powerful. Also, even if you don’t get to endgame, WGLF has a purpose and can be used. You could even max out tokens before the game ends. NOLB however, will sit there doing nothing for you.
---
"What, do you think I'm blind or something?!"
---
Totally agree. People will argue that it is counterable, which it is, but only with a coordinated swf group. If you're getting face camped as a solo player... let's just say you better hope the next game is better.
---
I see allot of salty killer mains lol! But this definitely looks like a high ping issue, you kept slithering around super quick. Hope it gets better. Right after the Christmas update with legion I got fucked over twice on opening the hatch with a skeleton key so I feel your pain. Was going for the 4 man hatch achievement of where did they go?
---
it sucks for the hooked surv. but yeah you could have luck and kill two survivors or lose the on the hook, if you're really lucky you get teabagged at the gate and a friendly ez in the chat. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It was never acknowledged that i gave chance srsly, played the last 4 month with so that the last hooked had a chance to be rescued. It was always taken for granted or i got taunted in the chat. there were games where this brought a lot of fun, many more i was like should had camped.
---
If Ash got his hands on Billie's chainsaw I feel the entity wouldn't live much longer :/
---
Imma say it. Legion is getting buffed. Shitty killers won't be able to get free downs with 0 effort anymore, but decent killers will still be able to shred with him, probably even more so.
---
The bih guy is an idiot
---
Is this Kickass ?
---
Good job BHVR!! I mean it from the bottom of my heart ❤️ Please don't let the 1% of the community who likes Legion change your mind about these changes.
---
Tbh I’m glad that the killers that are the least fun to play against (legion and Freddy) are not S tier where you run into them every game
---
Yes because rank 1's all play a shit ton of legion because of how unhealthy and OP he is.  
---
You're gonna say that and keep a straight face bro really?:D
---
That's how i felt with Freddy when i got him.  He definitely needed some sort of rework. I can about that.  But after they nerfed him so hard it felt like i wasted money.  Very frustrating they didn't take the time to fix him before moving on to more content.  If you release something that doesn't work, you should fix it before trying to push the next chunk of content.
---
Yeah, exactly and even if ur in a SWF group sometimes it's impossible to get the player hooked considering ur swf group couple be just one other person (my case) and the killer could either have NoED or any other insta-downs that the other survivors are scared of like MM, Billy, LF or a insta-Huntress
---
What?
---
Wait are you a chick? Cuz if so that changes things.
---
Sloppy butcher, pop goes the weasel, nurses calling (maybe), thanataphobia, discordance, corrupt intervention, etc
---
Freddy, Dying Light, a pink or green mori, and the Black Box add-on is straight up nasty.
---
Go back to Canada for fuck sake
---
Racist
---
What
---
Eh I’m happy with him just dead on the floor the way he will be soon
---
Mhm.
---
Why sloppy?
---
Homophobe
---
I've had the same thing happen on gens. Also, trying to unhook players taking at least 3 seconds from the time I click to the start of the action.
---
As soon as they start to repair the gen it triggers.
---
&gt; Couple that with the penalties for using Feral Frenzy and it's almost like you'll be better off never using your ability at all.
---
You're not better off at all, the first hit on the survivor is basically free if you aren't swinging mindlessly, you can get multiple people injured way faster than you would by just going around with your basic M1.
---
If the survivors want to heal, they will be forced to mend. If you use perks and add ons that slow these processes, you will get a lot of pressure. Plus healing against you is less effective, as you can easily get them injured again. 
---
The survivor won't ever be able to instaheal or heal with adrenaline in a chase vs Legion, since you need to mend before you use an instaheal and adrenaline treats deep wound as a health state, so they don't heal to full. Instaheals and adrenaline are both meta, so being able to completely nullify them in most situations is definitely a plus.
---
You are basically a weaker Plague.
---
When you "main" both of two available sides, it's not really "maining" anymore
---
I’m happy with the 1 hit miss because he literally could swing 500000 times and there was just not counterplay to that
---
Didn't know that, I'll take it off.
---
More abuse. Sweaty killer main. I'll wipe my ass with your cereal
---
Mermaid man dies at the end
---
Just wondering, what rank are you? Because if you getting face camped then I’m assuming that you are rank 15 or lower. That usually is the place where all the face campers are
---
The only time I’m okay with camping Killers is once the gens are powered. It just makes sense for the Killer to secure his one kill instead of hunting for another survivor and risk losing his kill.
---
Increases healing times meaning survivors spend more time healing less time doing gens
---
An I'll nut on your Cheerios bitch, I know you like that shit salty
---
Too much salt but no pepper. Go back to Canada
---
Build your wall pussy
---
The perk is rendered obsolete just by having a rough timer in your head. It's natural and completely intuitive to keep track of how long someone has been on the ground for. And once they are fully recovered, they begin crawling anyway, cueing you in on as much. 
---
And even regardless of that, what use is it to know the recovery progress of a survivor? Either you go and try to pick them up, or you don't, potentially waiting to do so at a later point. "Oh, they are only 60% recovered instead of 80%, healing them up would take me 3 seconds too long because for some reason I know the killer will come back to pick them up exactly 3 seconds too early."? Either you go and try and heal someone up when you have the opportunity to, or you don't - their recovery status hardly plays into this decision at all, it's almost always based on other circumstances. I mean, I guess it can be used to identify non-players that don't even attempt to recover, not having to waste the couple of seconds to walk up to them to realize as much at that point, but then if you are having enough games with players like that to warrant taking this perk for it (and it would still be a low-impact, low-value choice), the least of your problems is your perk loadout. I know random survivors are pretty awful pretty often, but having people just refuse to recover is luckily still rather rare.
---
And the 6-second aura read on the killer is painfully meh.
---
It's another non-perk, among many such on both sides. It would be kind of good if it allowed you to heal downed survivors a lot faster, or made you heal them into healthy state, or gave them a sprint or hit immunity for a couple of seconds after doing so, or some comparable actually-impactful effect, alas, the majority of perks are not actually impactful.
---
This 100%.
---
Also, as an aside, even if Legion was nerfed into the ground and made worthless that is still better for the game than a killer that is so shit to play against that people insta dc when they see him.
---
I don’t give out gamer girl feet pics though unfortunately 😔
---
You killed everyone but the main character.
---
\*Entity Displeased\*
---
Tru but camping, and then DCing so nobody else can win? That's ridiculous. And to top it off, like I was saying in my post, if ur gonna end up camping in the end because u spent all game chasing one survivor common sense is to go hunt the other 1-3 survivors, right?
---
No
---
Damn you’re right. You got me.
---
It was about 10 games that actually got affected. All of which are very old (Stuff like MLB Show 15).
---
No other games are affected.
---
I don’t think he should’ve been nerfed into the ground just changed so that the survivors have counter play while the killer side is fun
---
Correction, the rework needs to be sent back to the drawing board, and BHVR needs to come up with a proper rework for this killer that benefits both sides
---
Exactly and now you've gotten it nerfed toi far dumbass
---
“I call this meeting to order. All in favor, slap.”
---
SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP
---
THE REWORK WILL BE REMOVING MY FOOT OUTTA YO ASS
---
Spine chill for iron will. Its great for quickly finishing a gen and alarm system for all killers.
---
I agree with this. You’re saying what everyone else is saying about the nerfing being bullshit, and yes he won’t be a new Freddy he’s still a typical M1 killer and he does fine with that. He was never OP and most people do put survivors into mending and then M1 them anyway which is how it will be played after the nerf. However the nerf like you said, is still overnerfing. Idk why you’re getting downvoted for agreeing with most people in the comment section but still giving a very valid opinion about how he is still playable to an extent.
---
No, then I'll be an illegal, you go back over it
---
I’ll have you know not only is Huntress wonky for me on PS4 but also she’s only level 40 by means of me wanting her perks and nothing else and I’m absolute dog ass on her, but thank you for that compelling piece of rebuttal, Huntress has been completely turned around and I’m ready to pull off cross map hatchets cause it’s “easy as shit”. 
---
Thank you reddit user captainscottland, you’re truly a saint among the common folk.
---
I’m not saying that I play both killer and  survivor his ability should’ve been reworked to be fair for both sides not nerfed like Freddy was when he first came out
---
I remember the first time I got biggined.  It hurt.

I love ass cereal

Apparently you haven't been playing video games in the past decade, then.  :p
---
I love playing against Doc but that’s mostly because he’s my main on Killer.  He also eliminates the aspect of Stealth, so bye bye urban evasion survivors that just crouch in the corners.
---
Not bad, but you forgot /s
---
And it'd be rng which one you got with a 99% chance of getting one you already have and a .000001% chance of getting the one you want.
---
See for me, the best skin in the game is my p3 Billy (never, ever, fall in love with the first killer you play, literally only play him to p3, then once you realize how the perks from other killers work, cry profusely. I'm now stuck in lvl 50 bloodweb hell)
---
I think it should be Mettle of Man now
---
As a player who was just starting to practice with Legion I cant really say much besides the "if you miss you automatically stop Ff". That's a bad call many players and I miss on the first swing. It sucks that bad Legion who uses cheat tactics and exploits to win fucks everything up for the wholesome legion players. I never once moonwalk because I didn't know how to on ps4
---
IT IS BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT.
---
Not enough responsible discussions about legion were happening. Not enough people said specifically what was wrong with legion or how it could be improved, but anyone can tell that delete legion is just a meme and the devs needed to get more feedback from the community about it. All they have to do is go and have a conversations with the youtubers, they all have very good ideas about the game and how they can improve/rework killers but they don’t. They just see people posting memes and think “wow this is an accurate representation of the majority of our community coz thousands of people liked this post that is definitely not a meme”.
---
So a killers entire power has the capability of the chainsaw add ons? Idk man
---
I WAS SURVIVOR, AND GOT TUNNELED BY LEGION FOR 4 FUCKING GENS, BUT THEN I DIED AND LEGION DIDN’T CAMP ME BUT MY FUCKING TEAMMATES DIDN’T SAVE ME FROM HOOK. LONG STORY SHORT I DIED ON FIRST HOOK WHEN THE KILLER DIDN’T EVEN CAMP ME
---
Can we have a face like that.
---
You forgot your caps lock. Calm down
---
Canadian
---
Mmmm when people play legion after the nerf I’m gonna have an easy (yet STILL UNFUN, WHICH WAS THE REAL PROBLEM) game.
---
I know this is a nine day old comment but I disagree
---
It’s not the best perk for him but it’s not as bad as people say. Combine it Huntress Lullaby and Survivors have an instant escape from the Dream World at the cost of massive gen regression.
---
I know this is a 9 day old comment but pig is not d tier
---
It was the plan all along.
---
I know this is nine days old but oinkers is not c tier
---
Ok you were just a bit harsh but it's alright now.
---
LEGION IS REALLY FUN TO PLAY AS, BECAUSE YOU GET TO RUIN PEOPLES LIVES
---
I straight up only played them when it was a ritual because I didn’t want to hear people complain about me playing the Killer. Even as survivor I found them annoying, but far from the worst killer to play against in terms of mechanics.
---
How could you say something so controvercial yet so brave?
---
I honestly like the Legion changes, I'm excited to play them when they come out. I've always wanted to do some zooming around, but the fact that it was so easy to get hits and downs since all you had to do was wait for cooldowns really turned me off. I'd like to have to do some thinking and have an actual chase instead of that.
---
I couldn't agree more with a post, take an upvote.
---
The only thing I'd change about the Legion update would be making it so you can use your power without it having to be charged to 100%. That way you can use it in a small burst after a pallet is thrown down or a survivors vaults a pallet. 
---
That way if they keep running forward instead of looping it, you can vault it and get some distance. Sure you still get stunned once you cancel the power, but you still get closer to them than you would by kicking the pallet. 
---
On some powerful windows like Ironwork's of Misery window that would add up a lot of distance while still being balanced, as you still need to go through the stun animation.
---
tldr?
---
lmao ups...
---
Yessss
---
F
---
I think it might be dependent on your region.  I’m in the Midwest of USA and the longest wait time I’ve ever had was @3am and even then it was only 15 minutes to go straight to a full lobby.
---
It's not about winning the match, it's about them not having any counterplay in a chase and being a miserable experience to go against them. There is nothing fun about going against Legion as it is right now, they just wait for cooldowns to get free hits on you.
---
Yes they are weak in terms of getting 4ks on teams reliably, but they are absolutely god awful to play against. That's why people hate them and why Legion causes the highest number of disconnects/people stopping to care about the match they're in.
---
Its my favorite perk.
---
1) Because apparently all survivors everywhere have 100% positional awareness of the Killer as soon as they enter terror radius. This is considered baseline skill for survivors and all Killers should be able to cope with it naturally. 
---
2) Again: *on console.* Yes, 2.6 did wonders for the game’s frame rate but it wasn’t absolute and you still feel the drops, particularly on Legion and Hag who are really close to the ground and have all of the survivor’s model on screen. It’s made worse on Legion due to his speed tanking the frames even further. Again, you have maybe a tenth of a second to decide if that shoulder jerk (assuming you see the shoulder jerk and not just the survivor’s leg leaving frame) was a fake or the real deal. Depends on the map, sure, fine.
---
Yes, technically, it goes faster. 100% with one, like 190% with 2. But there is greater risk when putting more people in the same gen. 
---
Remember Discordance (the legion one?) can have killers see auras of gens with multiple people, and BBQ, especially since BBQ is on the shrine this week, can lead the killer straight to you after a hook. A gen with more people is more enticing, right?
---
I like it
---
Joey looks weard in this pic
---
Most of the cosmetics suck though, so if I were to spend my money on something I’d rather get a whole character than some outfit I may settle on because it’s all that’s there or there may be something way better that comes out in the future.
---
I agree. Spending money on the legion is the worst purchase I’ve ever made on a video game and this is coming from someone who bought savini Jason for Friday the 13th the game and we all know how that went.
---
Ok. Bye
---
Not gonna lie, they had us there in the beginning
---
The one core thing you forgot is that he still gets the refresh on his power when hitting a player without deep wounds. You said:
---
&gt; U wot m9? So, this means the Legion is an M1 killer now? From my understanding, this means the Legion’s power is only going to be used for catching up to a survivor to get the first injuring hit, nothing else. Why would I use my power then? You buffed my speed up to 115%, I can just walk right up to them normally, hit them, not get stunned (oww my hands) and continue the chase for the second hit WITH scratch marks and blood pools, which help me a ton. Why would I gimp myself that much for a random first hit on a random survivor?&gt; 
---
In actuality you will want to feral frenzy and get the hit for an easy first hit (because you can vault, and are faster than 115 while in frenzy mode) then smack them which refreshes your power.
---
THEN you have a choice:
---
A. You go after the other players your new 32m heartbeat just detected
---
B. You continue after the same player.
---
If you chose option A you get a free hit on 2-4 players (most likely just two) then continue with option B on whichever player who's position you know (probably the last guy you hit).

IF you picked option B you gave them a speed boost from hitting them BUT unlike a normal m1 killer you do not have a wipe animation and are still moving faster than 115% due to the fresh on frenzy. Using this speed you catch up to the player faster than a normal m1 killer and deactivate frenzy (mechanically this is similar to a wraith uncloak, with the inability to hit and being slightly slowed).
---
Finally you finish the chase in 115 mode against an injured player. It is WITHOUT A DOUBT better to start a chase in feral frenzy against a full health player.
---
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
With this being said the biggest variable we don't know is the duration that feral frenzy lasts. If it does not last long enough to realistically chain multiple hits or catch up to a survivor you just hit then he will suck ass. Vice versa, if it lasts a decent bit longer you could realistically run past the survivor you just wounded and cut off a window etc.

---
Having the other three survivors turn into legion sounds like a game breaking idea.  How about instead when Feral Pact is active, the next obstacle that a survivor passes will have a Legion member lunge out with an attack.  The faux legion then immediately disappears after making the attack.
---
Tbh, that was what I initially imagined Legions power would be when he was first announced.
---
He's so boring, you just wait for a cooldown to use your power again and get a hit to down them.
---
No baiting, no mindgames, no nothing. Just wait for the cooldown or down them. Or admire the floor for a bit so that you can skip the whole process. That's not what I play killer for.
---
Just because you can't handle the game without nerfs
---
Nah. Legion is better now.
---
I know how you feel, almost every game I load into as survivor, there will be a dc, and whenever I play as killer I just get toxic survivors that message me after the game saying I was tunneling or camping
---
There is no counterplay to downing people with Feral Frenzy. You wait for a cooldown and get a free hit. There is nothing the survivor can do to avoid it.
---
THANK YOU!!! I could not translate that for the life of me
---
Yeah because you need nerfs
---
Sounds like he says camels every time
---
How did you even get here
---
&gt;The killer can't see the remaining timer. Why? Why would you deliberately hide information?
---
So that Legion doesn't have built-in whispers.
---
&gt;It was a bad idea for Pig
---
Why? Because the Pig can't camp boxes when she sees their timer getting lower so they can do literally nothing to take it off?
---
&gt;but for BT it's annoying as hell.
---
I agree, imo borrowed time shouldn't have been changed to deep wound. The original effect was good enough.
---
WHY DO I KEEP GETTING 3V1S LIKE IVE BEEN PLAYING KILLER FOR 2 DAYS AND IVE HAD LIKE 10% OF GAMES WHERE SOMEONE DOESNT DC LIKE I WANNA HOOK 4 PEOPLE SO I CAN TRYHARD THE ADEPT ACHIEVEMENT AND GET 4KS IN PEACE
---
(NOTE: IT WAS VERY SATISFYING TODAY TO PICK UP THE P3 CLAUDETE ONLY FOR HER TO DC BUT MY POINT STANDS)
---
*angry groovy*
---
As a killer: Punishes survivors for gen rushing and not taking the time to cleanse totems. The people who bitch about it being OP don’t take the time to cleanse totems and gen rush. I think the perk is fine as is and shouldn’t be change. 
---
As a survivor: Pretty much the same as killer. Punishes me for gen rushing and not taking the time to cleanse totems. 
---
Overall, it’s a fine perk. People who bitch about it being OP don’t take the time to cleanse totems and they deserve to be hit with NOED. Sue me for that opinion, I don’t care.
---
If I'm being completely honest it's a big letdown. I either never get to use it because I escape without being chased enough or die to quickly. I even jumped on with my friends and still got no use out of it. When I play killer it's a pain to play against and it's usually enough for me to stop chasing the survivor so I don't waste more time. Not to brag but maybe I just haven't played against any killers as good as me and won't get any use out of it until I hit the high purple or red ranks.
---
I guess that isn’t as well known, p3 Claud also has meme renown while tap lacks in that regard.
---
I like the legion update, cause honestly every legion i go against  moon walks/breaks chase and looks down cause they're too lazy to play properly
---
Lowering the frenzy speed so he can't just go ape shit and hit everyone isn't making it less annoying? What did you want them to do? Some magical changes where they make him less annoying without changing anything? Honestly, what did you want?
---
Bloodweb is pure rng. Just hope for the best, eventually even with awful luck you will get the things that you want, as you'll buy out every other possible perk.
---
Just the nature of RNG :c
---
Bruh
---
bruh
---
People on this sub being drama queens? That's so preposterous I think I may just kill myself now
---
Pretty weak bait
---
This would mess with bloodwarden. Cool concept but they basically already have something similar.
---
Sadly yes
---
*Groovy*
---
1. no
---
2. see above
---
Multiple voices in the community that have a ton of experience and thousands of hours in the game have all agreed that Legion needed more changes than just moonwalk fix.
---
Pretty good JOB so far.
---
Looking through bricc’s profile
---
“fAcE CaMpInG Is A lEGitE StRaT”
---
Yep lol first time I’ve ever actually read what he said
---
Git gud you scrub survivor. No salt without pepper
---
Pig/Plague main but go off ig
---
Riri, but then Adam has a bit more hair for $5.
---
You admit most of the cosmetics suck, but you give someone shit for using shards on a character instead of cosmetics. Haha pick a lane bro.
---
What's your opinion on lithe? Is it worth it?
---
Rank 20’s get a free pass on a lot. I played killer on my friends account when I was at his house once, and I definitely felt bad killing them all, so I’ve started being the super encouraging survivor if I’m at high ranks
---
.....you missed the literally thousands of comments about 'no counterplay' and how he's annoying because his ability to hit you is OP? That is the part they nerfed.
---
&gt;1) Because apparently all survivors everywhere have 100% positional awareness of the Killer as soon as they enter terror radius. This is considered baseline skill for survivors and all Killers should be able to cope with it naturally. 
---
You are saying that counterplay to that would be not getting found at all in the first place. That is not counterplay to the ability.
---
&gt;2) Again: on console.
---
Ok so in some specific situations it might be a little bit harder to hit a base attack on someone. That doesn't change the fact that the ability itself doesn't have counterplay, and the fact that on pc you'll never have that problem so even that tiny bit of a chance the survivor has to avoid it gets removed there.
---
You don't see any problems with this?
---
So much over compensation. We know you're a survivor main
---
Don’t rage at the game over a ps plus problem, you can just get it on pc and you don’t need any subscription. But you should contact Sony or amazon with your problem.
---
Coming from someone who thinks facecmaping is a legit strat, your opinion is already invalid lmaoooo
---
I agree, but I entirely despise you for face-camping, since no-one wins, you don’t move and lose almost an entire medal from being near hooked survivor, and survivors are then not having fun since some jackass isn’t letting them play because bp is for some reason more important than having fun.
---
I despise those traps with a passion. They never get me on the way into somewhere but when I go to run away from her and they pop up and change my direction. Ooooooh.
---
that locker juke/adrenaline combo  😍😍😍
---
He could have in game voice lines complaining about the broken saw
---
No, because sloppy butcher doesn’t effect repair speed. The penalty would have to be a very intense penalty. Somewhere along the lines of like -100% penalty to all actions (except mending)
---
He has no counterplay, but that doesn't mean he's op....
---
&gt;Also, the way he used the word is not in a derogative way towards that group.
---
Any use of the word is derogatory unless you yourself are part of the affected group.
---
An entire character and their perks &gt; cosmetics. But go off.
---
The original has become the knockoff
---
No, both killers and survivors dislike him.  
---
He isn’t that great at killing and has a pretty linear play style that ignores all chase mechanics so he isn’t that satisfying to play as.
---
Survivors hate him because he ignores all chase mechanics and so has no counter, and people can be really scummy with him.
---
I always get the 4ks. You can't beat me when I face camp.
---
The Doctor has a bat that looks very Lucille-esque.
---
Now if its rank 10 to 1 being potato in a locker then I sincerely want to shank them
---
I always get a 4k. Like I said you're just a scrub. I'm not apologising again
---
Oh yea, perfect!!
---
No, they didn't. His power will now be used to Deep Wound one survivor and look around to see if there's another target so Legion can apply pressure through multiple chases, as has been his theme. And depending on his add-ons, he may be able to Frenzy through a window and cancel it quickly after to mind-game a survivor and land a normal M1 after the fact.
---
Regardless, no matter what you say, his being 115% movement speed automatically makes him a better killer than he was, period. Whether or not it's boring is another argument. But this is by no means any kind of nerf.
---
Deep wound isn’t nothing still. It is basically a free hit, and it’s time the survivor has to waste outside of the chase later. It’s definitely not *good*, but it still does something
---
It's totally fair. But I still don't do it as a killer.
---
I see a lot of people saying this with no ideas as to how to do it. I've seen people just say ban the exploits but that doesn't make the tons of people who found the lack of counterplay to legions power any happier on that front. I'm curious as to what exactly people want? I'm not trying to be rude, I just read it and was like "wow they responded pretty quickly and it sounds like there's counter play now! This should make people happy." And then I log on to see a lot of upset people. I'm just curious as to the specifics of what people think would work instead of this patch?
---
It’s also a quick first hit, meaning he’s a 4.6 m/s killer who doesn’t have to hit twice. Technically he’s better at chases than doctor still
---
Even knowing the translation, all I ever hear is “you get the occasional cone to the tune tay”
---
True lmao, no killer is broken if you’re good enough tbh
---
How could you be so insensitive. People died you son of an asshole
---
Whoops thought it was the green one. My mistake.
---
Legion doesn't need a nerf, he needed a more interesting rework.
---
Any exhaustu9n perk is good. Especially because lithe got buffed now you can control when you use it. I would say get and combine it with quick and quiet and dance with me.
---
Nurse says hello
---
when I’m playing plague and this happens, I get a little giddy inside 😂😂
---
Lmao okay then riddle me this camp man.
---
If you are camping in red ranks then tell me how you can pip if you don't get another survivor?  We will have all 5 gens done before they are dead on hook while you sit there and camp making it an EZ game for us.
---
I’m starting to believe you’re, well, an idiot. You didn’t even say anything about what I said. You just flaunt what a terrible killer you are, since face camping is essentially a, “ I can’t chase survivors and can’t have fun,” type of deal.
---
Obviously neckbeard is obvious
---
exactly. where on earth does this lie on the community lolll
---
Oooh yeah, many, many hours collectively put into these. I like SFM memes, so I wanted to try and push this sub to using them more frequently by making them myself. :D
---
Who the fuck worships peewee herman
---
Did this go on for the rest of the match?
---
Also applicable
---
As a survivor main I completely agree it’s your last chip
---
I get 4ks every time because your stupid and tyr to rescue your friend. It's not my fault you're a scrub
---
Yeah. Couldn’t swing, throw hatchets, vault or kick pallets/generators
---
4ks is winning. I flaunt that I win, what is there to say to you? I'll wipe your ass with my toast if we play each other thays how far apart it is
---
You look like that one Viner lol
---
Alot can happen in 1 minute. Including nothing.
---
It can also be 100% ineffective. 
---
I felt like 55s is fair at rank 1. Haunted ground rank 1 is what? 30s? If you are not in a chase when that activates then its basically pointless.
---
This is also the end game. 55s are usually used to hide anyway. If you dont see the gate icons then you know whats up anyway.
---
Imo 55s is nothing at end game.
---
We don't rescue camped survivors in red ranks, ever. So I want to challenge this.
---
I am on ps4. I will play kill your friends with you and my friends or any randoms on reddit. You might get one of us but you won't get more than that.
---
You were both being dicks in different ways. They were indicating since you don't agree you must not play killer and that their opinion is fact. You were dismissing their opinion as nothing to fuss about because you personally find it to be nothing to fuss about. While you did explain your reasoning quite well and thoroughly, technically the opinion on if something is good or bad is for each individual to decide. 
---
So as an impartial bystander, there's my 2 cents on it.
---
&gt; LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE 
---
He was and will remain *literally* playable. Nothing is stopping you in-game from playing Legion.
---
what. I never said anything about winning, and also, I keep my ass clean thank you very much.
---
That's a dumb reason to facecamp.
---
No. You weren't helping him find other survivors, you should be fine.
---
Well, you're not *wrong*.
---
I get 4ks every time. I also don't use scrub technology. Giving a console to me is like giving a biro to mozart. Get on pc and I'll 4k you and all your friends
---
It’s the law of equivalent exchange
---
Ahhh, I didn’t know the BP cap affected the perk.  That makes sense!
---
Naw, happens to me a bunch of times
---
A developer posted on the Legion change thread that now you don't need to down people while using frenzy for the achievement (as it is impossible to do it now).
---
All you need to do is down the survivor while they are in deep wound. You just need to down them with your m1 swing.
---
Yeah because you've not played me yet
---
Lmao you can pick all of our perks. I think you are full of shit and I will play PC if you like
---
You'll be fine. The other guy's just a shithead.
---
They just needed to fix his broken add-ons.
---
Just because 2 perks are similar doesnt mean its bad. 
---
People run Hope and Adrenaline all the time. Its whatever though. Thanks for your thoughts on it.
---
They really aren't as bad as people are making him out to be. He's a weaker Plague if anything.
---
I've done this a lot before its pretty fun as pig
---
Why is that?
---
It will be streamed and posted on this sub
---
Ah yes I love never getting kills and de-piping all the way back down to rank 20
---
Didnt say its bad though. Just said it was a cool concept. 
---
No problem! 😃
---
You cant get 5 gens done in one hook camp believe me we've tried. Lol
---
Good because I like to humiliate the scrubs
---
Were you a Leatherface on swamp, by any chance?
---
"The ability to hit is OP" was worded unclearly, I apologize. I meant the ability to perform the action (quickly, with ease and no penalties for missing, etc.) was OP. I did not mean the action of hitting them or his hitting power is OP. 
---
My apologies on the unclear wording
---
No I wasn’t
---
Include the time the killer is looped
---
Go buy a pc and let's go then. I'll wipe my ass with your toast
---
Thanks, friend!
---
Y’know what? I see your point. Alright, this is a pretty good perk idea, gp
---
You can’t just be an ass to people who want to play with friends, blame BHVR for not having a swf toggle.
---
I just prestiged Freddy a few days ago so I don't have Monitor but I will get it ASAP. Thanks for the advice. I still need to unlock Lullaby though.
---
Pretty much. It's always the dumbass shit talkers that get merked and pussy out.
---
That's what is seems like. Thanks for the advice!
---
I already have a PC and the game on steam. Would you like to play tonight? Let's find some "scrubs" on here to play with me. I will loop you to eternity and beyond I guarantee it
---
Holy shit. I changed someones mind in this sub. Idk how to feel.
---
YEAH. A WRAITH ASKED WHY I BULLIED HIM AND THE IRONIC THING WAS I WAS THE SACRIFICAL MEAT ON THE HOOK HALF THE GAME WHILE THE OTHERS BODYBLOCKED AND HE TRIED TO CAMP FOR A KILL. I'M NOT THE ORCHESTRATOR I'M A BYSTANDER MY DUDE.
---
I still don't think that's op, though unless it's a tunneling killer and even then, that's only op to one guy
---
Well there’s nothing I can do to get BHVR to add the toggle so I’m going to punish the people who are constantly making the game unenjoyable for me
---
Post a pic of your rank atm. With a pic of today's date written on a paper in the pic as well
---
yea im scared to do shit like this on EU cuz like 80% of people cant comprehend anything
---
You won't even be welcome on the sub after I beat you. People keep asking me "how do you get 4ks all the time" and this is how. Because I beat the scrubs who get too confidence
---
Thank you!
---
I’m pretty sure some killers have addons that effect repair speed?
---
4 charges of Deep Wounds and each Frenzy hit removes 1 charge?
---
SAME? IT'S SO WEIRD PEOPLE ASSUME STUFF LIKE THAT AT THE START, IF PEOPLE ARE MAKING BOLD SAVES OR DOING SILLY STUFF TOGETHER ETC I COULD UNDERSTAND THE ASSUMPTION THEY MAY BE SWF TOGETHER BUT STRAIGHT UP SEEMS KINDA ODD. PEOPLE ARE A BIT TOO PARANOID. 
---
I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING A FAIRLY LONER JEFF/QUENTIN MAIN, I JUST WANT TO DO SOME GENS IN PEACE AND GET OUT. NOT SURE HOW PLAYING THE GAME NORMALLY IS SUDDENLY TOXIC.
---
your thoughts on the shit heart on the toilet?
---
Man, I always thought he said I get leakage. I don't know what I would have been leaking from exactly but I liked it!
---
0/10, missed the part where Nea comes to flashlight you out of cloak just before you hit Claudette
---
In all seriousness good drawing take my upvote
---
Or with Clown when he has the puppet. Fucking killed the puppet man....
---
its not the same at all. one is a haha slammed ya and the other is im going to stand here until you are DEAD, give no opportunity for salvation.  both toxic but not similar. teabagging drives me crazy but i still cant bring myself to face camp someone. its boring and you usually get only 1K or 2K unless youre a chainsaw boi.
---
I mean a lot of people, including the people who think these changes aren’t ideal seem to care. But okay.
---
dub
---
Its because they wanted him to be balanced and fun to play against not the next freddy
---
I just report anyone that dc's and hope it actually has meaning down the road, a functional player feedback system would be nice to have to deal with those losers
---
Save the Best for Last and BBQ is two that I would always reccomend. Others are Monitor and Abuse, Sloppy, Pop goes the Weasel, Enduring and Rancor.
---
No, I’m saying 360. I’m telling you from both sides — as someone who isn’t particularly good at survivor or Legion — they work. Point of order, I might have only ever gotten my 360s to work on Legion. Either way, we’re now talking about an attack that has nearly twice the stun time of any other missed attack. It’s a Leatherface tantrum that triggers every single time you use your ability whether it hits or not. The difference is that it will *never* down you. Whether you admit it or not, there’s counter play there.
---
No I think legion nerfs are fine so far. He was a bitch ass killer that no on enjoyed playing against. The only people who liked legion was people who played legion everyone else fucking hated him. Nerf that bitch into the ground lol
---
So essentially the power that was meant to spread around survivors and hit multiple people now ends after one stab. Is it just a normal attack now or does it still apply deep wounds and require 4 stabs? What else did they take and or give?
---
You obviously have not seen a good pig if you think hes got more potential than a pig.
---
You are entirely taking what I said and turning it on it's head.
---
I am not saying they did it for that reason, because that is stupid. I am saying that they listen to what their fans are shouting, and when an entire subreddit is saying "Delete legion, nerf legion, fix legion" , and turned the killer into a meme for being insanely broken and DC'ing against them, they most definitely thought 
---
"Wow, the community HATES legion. We need to fix it". 
---
I am saying that we should have asked for a change, not upvoted every mean comment about legion and having hoards of memes about him being broken. 
---
My point was, I thought , very clear. I can see, apparently, this is not the case.
---
Why do I have to let the game be unfun for me but fun for them?
---
I thought it was "you get the camels and the li- that you for tuning into the stream today and shaloom"
---
That is, literally, my exact point.
---
But when you have the same post titled “my opinion on the legion changes” all saying the same thing like “oh they should’ve reworked not nerfed him” or “ now he’s a useless killer” or “ bvhr needs to fix this!” ( which they won’t lol) it just gets boring and repetitive. I do get what your saying though.
---
Is there usually Easter cosmetics or nah? I'd be really nice to see some light pastels
---
If the people you chased were SO bad that you destroyed them with 5 gens left then YOU dont deserve to pip just because they were complete trash.
---
At the same time you should not derank either. You just kept your rank.
---
What I said is what it is. It still applies deep wound but that’s all they have going for them now.
---
It's from 2017 lol.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I'll get the champagne &lt;3
---
1. That's what I figured.
---
2. Huh. So regular Feral Frenzy hits won't decrease the timer but with Frank's mix tape they will?
---
3. Too bad. Combining IB with Coulrophobia would really slow survivors down.
---
4. Extra question Does the DW timer only stop in Terror radius or Terror radius and chase? For example if I used a perk that drops my terror radius to zero(Tinkerer or Dark Devotion) in chase would the DW timer start going down even though I'm still in chase?
---
I mean we can't laugh at toxic idiots being idiotic? 
---
Can you explain you're point?
---
While it would be great, I know McD's will never sign off on it. They don't want anything resembling their mascot in a game that will scare children.   
---
Otherwise children may stop eating their food, and grow up healthy.
---
I wasnt going to buy Feng since lithe is on the shrine this week but if bunny Feng comes out Ill buy her.
---
Had that happen twice today, not fucking helped by the fact that I run Save the Best For Last.
---
I am just a random Redditor, but I know BHVR people read this stuff. If its important to you post on their forum in the link.
---
You chose to play killer. You chose to run the risk to end up against a SWF. It’s not their fault they wanted to play together and maybe just hang out in call together. For starters, you don’t know they were definitely in a call together and the only person who seems salty here is you.
---
Oh! Hey, thanks!
---
I guess I didn't make the title clear.   
---
The problem is that a good majority of survivors I was playing with took that salt and threw nasty insults around in post-chat. Even if the killer has the option to close the chat, that lack of sportsmanship really reflects on the survivor, and not the killer.  
---
The other problem is that's a common misperception that survivors deserve to win once the generators are done. Like most people here have said, the killer has no further objective, the killer needs to kill you so when survivors throw around the terms, "camper, noob, cheater", other teammates take notice, newer players take notice, and assume that killers are those things.  
---
I hope the new end-game collapse fixes this issue because it seems really stupid for the killer to look the other way while everyone else escapes when their objective is to still kill you.  
---
I would recommend most killers just end the post-game chat, of course. But if they're willing to offer good sportsmanship, survivors should too unless they're CLEARLY being ridiculous.  
---
Just remember, the killer's job is to make sure you die and I would even argue that camping before gens or tunneling is warranted in some situations. None of it's bannable. BHVR don't want you to report it.  
---
In fact, reporting anyone for camping or tunneling could be a reason why real issues are being addressed less and less in reports. I love how someone was able to call me a f\*ggot when I first started playing this game and that person is still not banned from this game. /s  
---
It's probably because salty people are flooding their inboxes with USELESS reports and WASTING *everyone's* time.
---
Rip legion spent 15 bucks on him now he gets big mf nerf never playing him again
---
Yeah but that’s like $8 for content, $5 for leatherface. 
---
You aren’t paying for a cosmetic stuff you are paying for something that gives you new perks and killer abilities to play around with and it continues to show support for a game you enjoy.
---
If you wanted to say that about cosmetics sure but anyone not paying for the dlc characters is a fool.
---
GOOD JOB ON THE FOLLOW THROUGH MAN
---
Agreed.
---
&gt; of them is porn.
---
Why? Embrace Susie. Susie is love. Susie is life.
---
It's always a damn Nea...
---
Says the person who should have witnessed the legion bad posts automatically get 3x more upvotes than anything you just listed.
---
I find it funny. You spend so much time on posts that you really must have a lot of disposable time to be arguing with people on the internet about a game. But please do feel free to enlighten me.
---
even worse if they  already equipped a flashlight on their swapped character .
---
You must be some hunter if you're often successful in pulling that off.
---
&gt; this is just a giant nerf across the board
---
Fail to see how he's nerfed if you don't count gutting essential parts of the deep wound cheese.
---
That or you constantly re-enter frenzy or miss swings. In that case just git gud.
---
115% for any killer is a game changer. Even if frenzy changed nothing but allowed you to deep wound someone this is a pretty solid killer in terms of pressure.
---
It should be bubba that he's asking for since you get BBQ and chili and he's $5 unlike billy
---
Gr8 b8 m8
---
Which they always do. Believe it or not there's a correlation between that happening and me playing Wraith, so it's about as annoying as it could possibly be. I've started running Franklin's out of paranoia, almost.
---
read the changes, then ask, how will frank's work?
---
"Stick that perk where the sun don't shine!"
---
I honestly thought he said "You get the cat emotes and lickage" thought he was fucking weird as after that..

You don't need cross map hatchets you just need to hit the hatchets. As soon as you know a survivor is gonna drop a pallet on you charge it up back step to avoid stun and let her fly. Same with windows. Or just straight up melee range
---
End game camping is fine, as long as it isn't toxic (hitting the survivor, nodding [kind of a stretch, but ot can be seen as toxic], or face camping). That's my opinion. Still sucks when it happens to me tho :/
---
Right. They're so focused on running loops that they end up lost and devoid of purpose if I break chases. They also don't ever seem to catch on to the fact that I will take a fucking pallet stun if it means being rid of the damn thing. The mask doubles as a Helmet!
---
It's his reason to face camp. He felt that in the moment that's what he wanted to do. If someone runs the fun then ruin their fun. What's your reasons to facecamp?
---
I wish Legion was a dead horse before, but BHVR definitely nuked the Legion horse dead now
---
This subreddit is ridiculous. lol.  
---
I'm gonna main Legion now just cause he's going to be a decent killer.  That base speed increase is nice.  Free hit, M1, hook.  Got a built in radar.  
---
Sorry you can't exploit by walking backwards now or mend bar exploits. So sad.
---
Wrong use of the meme
---
I love Tru, and this is part of his bit but man does it get me every time lol.
---
&gt; Shock Therapy does a good job of wasting time
---
This is bad. Doctor wasting time while survivors he isn't shocking are doing gens is a bad thing.
---
&gt; If you practice, you can prevent pallet looping with it
---
Against bad survivors sure, but good survivors know that it takes you a second to switch to treatment, a second to switch back, and you're a 110 killer while in treatment. The actual case to catch someone with shock therapy is rare (e.g.: a very specific distance and angle to lock someone out of Ironworks window). Otherwise, the counterplay to a doctor switching to treatment on a safe pallet is to just keep running.
---
So basically the perks that 90% of rank 1 already uses.
---
If the are face camping whats the point? You get grabbed too and then everyones dead?
---
I remember a match where two survivors are left and last man finishes gen while I carry back the other. I see him following behind me as I hook with a lot of walls around me. I camp in my little wall area but try to get at him as he runs around. I wait a little longer until the other sacrifices and I sprint down last man (wraith). I in cloaca before he can open the gate and I nab him. Full hooks for me. He gets pissed at me and sends some colorful messages. What do you want me to do, not win?
---
No ma'am unless you got BT, otherwise pressure the gens.
---
I dont remember seeing the word viable in the patch notes. He still can be played well. People ate acting like they took a blink away from the nurse or something.  It honestly makes me laugh that people are reacting like this before the PTB is even live.  Lots of fortune tellers in this community...
---
No Deliverance?
---
I will still try... pray for my soulq
---
How is this a discussion?
---
Oh well we can both agree there. I'm absolutely against that kind of behavior. The verbal abuse that happens during endgame chat can be disgusting at times.
---
And you're probably right. I could only imagine the kind of complaints they receive. 
---
I was just acknowledging that being camped, regardless of when it happens, is a bummer.
---
Legion was a shit tier killer just above Freddy.
---
1. Fucked over the killer by having a power that solely relies on tunneling because deep wounds is terrible for targeting multiple survivors in its self. 
---
2. Isn’t fun to play against the because the legion HAS to tunnel if they want to effectively use their power.
---
He needed a rework from the start, but now he’s getting the Freddy treatment. He’s going to be on the back burner for a year or two and then they’ll rework him. For now he’s just a meme.
---
It’s just you. If you hit someone and just stand still, it doesn’t matter cause you can’t see their Mend bar, can’t decrease it with FF hits and can’t even really make them bleed out unless you constantly had 0 TR.
---
Hillbilly has a shotgun + barbed wire bat combo weapon
---
Idk what the point is. I guess if it was me I'd want some to try for me. Really I just wanted insight. I can't get pasted rank 11-12 currently and it seems like you may get better ranks?
---
I'm a sir!
---
I was hoping he'd down you all.
---
thanks &lt;3
---
'Tis also the motto of Marth88's depip squad.
---
Completely agree. Legion was changed to be played as intended. He applies pressure with deep wounds and by doing so can focus on chasing other survivors. If they choose not to heal they're essentially exposed for the rest of the game. The whole "frenzy ends if you whiff" thing is dealt with by not whiffing. I think a lot of killers keep acting like missing is a common occurrence when it shouldn't be. 360 jukes can 100% of the time be countered by not being careless.
---
Most streamers are. At least he seems aware of it.
---
Right, Iridescent button is gonna be able to really slow down the match for survivors.
---
You can put 3m BP into anyone but that doesn’t mean you know anything lol.
---
is that what he says?
---
BHVR is better than 99/100 companies out there. Don’t be a prick over one single change you don’t like.
---
Pig is pretty weak as she has no chase power.
---
But I won, I won as much as a killer can win. I got punished for chasing too fast and that’s the problem. Killers and survivors are punished for doing too well and it feels bad because you did too good to pip. That doesn’t make any sense to me.
---
Read my comment again.
---
Last time I saw BPS used, I CTD'd before loading in.
---
*dabs on the haters*
---
spoken like a survivor that's been killing the game for years
---
False. You merely have to hook someone to activate blood warden I use it often on freddy. Often.
---
Cry me a river. There are better sources of DBD information on YouTube. Stop being so dramatic.
---
probably latency
---
To be fair, the legion rework was rushed. The freddy rework is years in the making.

I feel insanely shamed and apprehensively withdrawn.
---
That may be true but it almost never happens like that. It hasn't happened to me once because generally no one ever expects you to run it so they open the doors anyways so they can run to the gate after they pull you. If they did wait to open the gates that's still good for you too. Your hex idea would just negate the hooking part right? I think they should just rework blood warden to do it your way because it almost never last long enough. If it did it would be a A list killer perk.
---
To injure the survivor. Feral frenzy was never meant to be a downing tool. It was simply used to apply deep wound and injure survivors in the vicinity therefore slowing the game down and buying you time to chase. A killer should not be rewarded with a free down by using their ability to ignore the game's mechanics.
---
Ruin was on the shrine a few weeks ago
---
It's okay, I'm sure there's a locker to withdraw in.
---
It’s not only legion mains who have an issue with this “rework”
---
Legion isn’t a good killer. They’re quite shit actually. This is just a massive fucking nerf to an already bad killer, but guess what, the community wanted this so I guess the devs won’t revert it. We’ll have to wait another year or 2 to get a full legion rework and not this garbage. Hell, the Lion rework in Rainbow Six Siege is better than this, and he’s much more broken than legion.
---
Ugh. Fine.
---
Just because gens are done, the game isn't over. How is it that when killers use perks for endgame its "taboo" and wrong? But when a survivor does its ok?
---
My perk idea is easily countered and has potential to not even work. It would be far too strong as a non hex therefore I made it counterable easily.
---
did you even mori the bastard? do not feel bad or sympathetic to the wretched youtuber &amp; streamer scum. smite them with divine fury, for they are a blight upon the entity's holy land!
---
Holy shit you're the guy from the other thread being a dick to OP for defending the legion changes! Throwing out immature insults because your argument has no substance is like your signature move haha
---
 [2 hours ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/beeoyx/there_are_too_many_people_saying_the_community_is/el5ccwt/)
---
Clearly they didn’t learn from their mistakes with Freddy...
---
Do you know how useless it is as a member of game design to hear “this killer is awful to play against reeeeee” as your only feedback?
---
This is what happened, survivors cried, the devs panicked and implemented way too many nerfs. He needed three changes, that’s it.
---
**It's genuinely hilarious how obvious it is that you're a butthurt legion main.**
---
Happens like that at high ranks. Problem is that Blood warden doesn't last long enough to be worth a damn.
---
James is such a sweetheart though and he’s new to the game I wouldn’t do that to him!
---
Yeah no. He is as bad as freddy now.
---
They're changing legion?...
---
Maybe I'll pick up the game again... See how it goes...
---
I'm just waiting for the free 2 play switch, they have the costmetics and the dlc and soon servers.
---
You forgot about doctor and the clown.
---
I love watching Deadmeat. Its a very good Horror channel on YT.
---
The way I play it doesn't matter. I go after one person so even if they wake up I sleep them again. It's a dangerous game either it works good or it will screw you over.
---
Yeah I had that too

We have such sites to show you.....once the game loa- it crashed.
---
His entire power is un fun and some kinda change (not NERF) is better than nothing.
---
I love his streams, but that's understandable.
---
it matters not foul witch! banish the fiend to the pits of hell from whence(wence?) he came!
---
End task. Restart dbd.
---
close it in task manager
---
Exactly what I thought the first time I heard him say it! Lmao
---
Imagine going back in my comment history to find a specific set of information to fit your agenda
---
while also skipping over the fact that I said legion needed a change. Couldn’t be me dude. Your life will get better eventually. 
---
L O L.
---
It doesn't last no. Even if you can catch up to two people and down them both one will get out. I'd like to think that when his rework happens his perks could be reworked to? I doubt it though.
---
Just about to comment that. Sucks to browse the internet sometimes.
---
*Laughs in Susie*
---
I stopped the gens by making sure no one was alive to do them. That’s good enough for me
---
Is this for real?
---
What? He always gets downs with his chainsaw. I don't understand your logic
---
HOLY SHIT THATS SO COOL, WTF!!!
---
Perks will most likely stay the same because they are not tied to him specifically. 
---
But yeah, 60s is basically running from 1 gate from hook, to the other and back to hook lol. No time to accomplish a damn thing.
---
It's entirely the communities fault. The dev's said the have seen mixed feed back on them since chapter 11 came out. It's not hard to go back a month and see all the posts every other day. I bet I can link more than 50 post since he was released complaining about him. We all did this now we are all whining. Like can we not take a minute to think with logic?
---
What comment
---
I mean... I definitely feel like I lost if I don't escape as a survivor.
---
FACECAMP AND CHILI MY FAVE
---
It was? How did I miss that lol
---
By ending it with the matter of fact statement that you did, you implied heavily that it was factual. Just how I see it
---
Honestly I think he’s under powered but imo he’s on the same level as a lot of m1 killers. If you’re out of dream state he’s almost always going to get a guaranteed hit if he knows what he’s doing. The only big issue is the end game hook rescues if Freddy is dumb enough to hook someone near the gate. Also he’s got some serious lunge range which makes up for a lot
---
Most of the theorycrafting for changes from most of them was nonsense that either made shit OP or actually made him even worse.
---
That's indeed the problem with most people. They like to THINK they know what they want and how to 'fix' stuff but don't comprehend the fact they really don't know what they want or what they're talking about most of the time.
---
Opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one but they think they HAVE to be treated as the authority on the subject just because they do....
---
Because survivor endgame perks are nowhere NEAR on the same power level as what you’re suggesting, and what already exists. 
---
Oh wow, Wake Up shaves off a whole 3 second of gate opening time, other perks give you extra bloodpoints for doing specific actions after the gate opens, or a ‘slight” speed boost to perform certain actions. We’re talking “parts of a second” here. 
---
The only post gen perk survivors have the killers whine about is Adrenaline, which can still be stomped out completely by NOED and this silly hex you’re suggesting. 
---
Or how about this. Maybe survivors SHOULD be rewarded for doing all the work that gets you to the endgame in the first place. All that work, and running, and healing, just to get spat in the face because you managed to miss one hex totem? 
---
No. Thank. You. 
---
Survivors already gotta deal with that shit in one form. Let’s not create another.
---
Gotcha. So I basically can't be the hero all the time.
---
Perhaps the entity has underestimated just what these killers are capable of and should be wary of trying to keep monsters in cages
---
Aww bro he doesn’t know the game all that well. Can’t loop worth shit but he’s cute when he tries🤣
---
He mained legion pre nerf, he's given up his rights to kneecaps /s
---
THE ONE FUCKING TIME I GO IN WITH BPS AND TWO OTHER PEOPLE GO WITH BPS AND WE GET A TRY HARD TWAT WAFFLE OF A HUNTRESS WHO'S RUNNING FUCKING NOED AND EBONY MORI IN A FUCKING 3V1. OH AND THEY'RE A TWITCH STREAMER TOO BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY FUCKING ARE.
---
MAYBE FUCKING RELAX WHEN IT'S A FUCKING 3V1
---
OH AND BONUS ROUND GOT THE FUCKER AGAIN AND HE WAS USING IRIDESCENT HATCHET.
---
FUCKING DICKBAG SHITLICKER.
---
I can hear them moving, i can hear them breathing! Stop dicking around!
---
I think OP was trying to say he regrets spending 9k Shards on buying Leatherface and a boatload of Bloodpoints to get BBQ instead of waiting a week and only having to spend ~4500 Shards.
---
I think he's mid tier right now, he's fine imo. Two small buffs is all he'd need to be perfect, no action progress in the dream transition and longer base range. I'm super scared that the rework will change him drastically, I've fallen in love with how Freddy is now, I dont want a new power.
---
High risk high reward my but they get cleansed 100% of the time unless it's a bad team. By no means are hexes useful against a good team. My idea to fix that? They only activate when you cast a hex.
---
Same here, I do this thing where no matter what I try hard against the first person I see and I always let the last person live. When they message me wether in thanks or hate I send them this
---
"The first to find is sure to die, but the last alive always survive."
---
It's asinine how many friends I've made from this gimmick alone lol.
---
Til the days of the Phoenix man, see you in the fog
---
Against good survivors, he really doesnt. Only time that he gets down is he's created a deadzone with no windows, or the survivor fucks up.
---
I know I usually just leave loopers but he wasn’t very good at it so that’s part of the reason I stuck on him ;w;
---
That's a pretty good point. They get to prey on newer players and those new players probably get discouraged to play. I suppose letting them rank up would prevent that
---
You missed the opinion flair my guy.
---
Oh wow i think i was the killer from that game. That or this guy is a serial dc'er.
---
These changes suck.
---
Bull crap. Connor will just free run his ass away. No way am I chasing that.
---
I'm extremely happy he was nerfed.
---
&gt;Putting Cannibal in F-tier. What even...
---
For one those killers aren't great either below rank 10, but they have stealth whereas legion doesn't. Legion will have a much harder time getting his first hit if they just run when they hear the terror radius.
---
Yeah Trapper is American, blackwashing is getting way out of hand
---
Because they're the two Killers so far who can enter the Spirit World (hence their Lightburn effects) or just because they'd make a fitting couple? Speaking of which, I saw a picture recently when I was looking up guitar tabs for Bayushki Bayu and it was a fanart of the Huntress and Myers with their masks lifted slightly, kissing. I think I actually prefer that ship to Trapper x Huntress tbh, which is always what I personally felt was most fitting (since trapping and hunting are both so closely related). In fact, I'll go as far as to dub it Myeress; I think it's pretty slick. Anything to see more appreciation and fanart of my dear Axey Girl!
---
Had this happen in my game just before and the killer had Dying Light...  
---
Fortunately the Michael was nice enough to let us farm &lt;3
---
Ur first sentence I only agree if it's a very toxic, t-bagging, flashlight clicking, cocky survivor.
---
2nd part, uh I mean if they never leave it and they all get downed I guess they kinda deserve it but I find basement camping leatherfaces the most unskilled group of killers. Anyone can camp a basement with a chainsaw that can mow down more than one survivor in just 3 seconds. That's one reason I tend to keep away from basement as a survivor unless I'm going for a save AFTER the killer leaves the basement. 
---
Not gonna lie the cat part confused me.
---
As for that last part, personally I think face camping should only be for punishing cocky/toxic survivors and to secure a kill after gates are powered. As for punishment, I honestly think emblem punishment isn't enough considering most ppl couldn't care less about their emblems and do it anyway. There should be some system of punishment for camping within a certain amount of distance from the hook for so long before the last gen is done. That way it's fair for the survivors who don't get to play and just spend 10 minutes staring down the killer from a hook before they die.
---
I thought is was a salt/rant or shitpost until I saw the flair
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shrines_of_Secrets_of_2019
---
Actually it was week 6-7 of 2019, so a few months ago :/
---
Hmm I don’t seem 2 ever have trouble, I have fast internet I’m guessing that’s why
---
Squidward new killer?
---
*skill it requires no skill. You are just taking advantage of someone usually after they get hooked it's a fast down. If they get away from the hook heal and are dumb enough to stay around where you first found them then that's on them though and not the killer. A lot of times I have down someone in the same spot I got them last time.
---
Das sum BULLSHITT
---
You can’t read and it shows. I never said it could be stacked with NOED. I said Survivors don’t need another end game broken perk to deal with. 
---
If the Killer struggles for two solid minutes at the end game, it’s on YOU!
---
See how your sentence is complete bullshit?
---
The existence of a counter does not make it balanced. Even in an asymmetric game, that perk is stupid OP, and as someone else already stated, there’s already a perk that does basically the same thing. A perk you actually have to WORK to use. 
---
I get the feeling that you like to bail when you sense your arguments are crumbling due to the introduction of logic. But since I know you’re going to read this, whether you reply or not, I’ll add in that I’m happy your idea will never come to exist in this game :)
---
Good luck with that.
---
I did this for the meme
---
This post pretty much sums up why Rank Reset is one of the worst things about this game.
---
Sorry stopped reading once I figured you're a legionmain, stay braindead monkeyboy.
---
Savini is one of the best Jason's though.
---
You leave my beautiful boy Leatherface alone you big meanie :(
---
It be like that sometimes
---
Well that's one way to make him completely useless instead of addressing the core issue with his kit.
---
Yep. I myself havent bought legion so it doesnt matter to me
---
Yes it is,  I'm only a rank 15 because of reset and the fact that I've barely played. I have been playing other games more. 
---
I just don't understand how he did all of that without any perks? I dc'd because we couldn't even get a gen to progress,  with no lag or anything,  and he even tried to taunt me? When I called him out he just said "Easyyyy" then once I said I was sending in clips,  he hasn't replied.
---
Selfie with the homies
---
I’m a survivor main fam
---
Also imagine taking this post seriously
---
&gt; So overall he'll be fine. I don't get what the huge fuss is over. 
---
Kneejerk reacting and also looking at everything that's a nerf while comparing it to what he gets as 'buffs'.  He'll probably be fine/potentially better than he is right now due to the MS buff, just now with Feral Frenzy you can't be a total Pepega and spam M1 without consequence.
---
First off, everyone complained about legion, that's not all on survivors. The 180 this sub has done is absurd. I used to just hate the shit posting, but now everything is shit.
---
Secondly, it's only PTB, they could very well scrap a few things for live. 
---
Also, there is a massive difference between update and reworking. Reworking the whole perk requires time and a lot of testing different possibilities/ideas and it is an indie company. Not exactly 1000s of people on hand.
---
I haven't been around long, but long enough to know that a lot of these "issues" were when they had 20 people working on the game. Since they got their freedom, updates happen pretty well imo.
---
You can use it while she is after you once and then what? Dodge one attack and then get downed?
---
I think this is a known issue. I've seen some Fog Whispers mention it on stream, warning to be careful about using them because you might not make it in.
---
From old videos I've seen, it's the opposite. Pallets used to be everywhere. You seem to pick and choose your points
---
Mettle is changing?
---
Agreed. They'll whine until every killer is made useless because they can't seem to grasp the point of games being sometimes you lose.
---
Theres literally no point arguing with you lol. Survivors like you feel like this game is just sooo against them that there is no reasoning or meaningful discussion to be had. 
---
Ill help inflate your ego and I wont reply to your next comment so you can have the last word. Cheers.
---
how come killers aren't allowed to have fun? only fucking survivors?
---
Uhhh no
---
Fuck that sub. Annoying af.
---
I'm so glad to see that this community is full of such reasonable and mature human beings.
---
Hex: FakeBlock
---
Jesus christ. Please play both sides.

No one plays Legion, nope. That's why out of 9 matches last night i played, 7 of them were Legion and tonights 7 matches had 7 Legion's ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Same can be said about killers.

How about stop being a massive cunt and try to get good

the way BT works now leads to that exact same situation
---
This is also the second time since Leathface’s release it’s been in the shrine, so people are really excited.
---
I love this
---
It doesn’t sound like he even says that. Lmao, I have friends with his accent and even they can’t understand what he says sometimes.
---
Don't get me wrong, my legiin is p3 lvl 50. I'm going to play doc out of spite.
---
Can you imagine thana, sloppy, and deep wounds though? That just sounds like nothing but pain.
---
Your 1000 means nothing.
---
Haha, thanks :&gt;
---
Nooo, James is so nice! He only want to count the kills, not cause them!
---
I mean Bubba isn't named Leatherface either
---
This doesn't seem solid enough. Need to try it in KYF
---
I get dodging if they brought extra blinks but why nurse in general?
---
I like it.
---
It's amazing how many ways people can say the same thing
---
That makes sense to me now
---
Its to prevent the Plague from keeping everyone sick, which many high rank players do anyways.
---
Balance wise, camping at any time is a fair tactic, it's just an incredibly boring one for both the killer and the victim.  
---
  
---
But ya, when people complain that I camp after gens are done, I ask them: "What should I have done instead? Let you escape?"  
---
They never have a good answer...
---
You should rank up by beating people as good, or better, than you.
---
I’m not going to ask about that flair 😂
---
Dude is a fuckin retard.
---
Look in the game?
---
It’s a bit more difficult now since the recent emblem changes requiring more emblem points to double pip, so the first thing is actually making sure you’re as close to level 15 as possible so you can get adept with 14/16 emblem points.
---
The first thing to worry about is gens. Now you only get points for the first 9 minutes, so it’s probably smarter to only injure survivors and kick generators unless you can end a chase quickly. This will also help with chaser points as injuring counts as a won chase I believe. Once 9 minutes passes, you can start looking for kills and do what you can to protect three close gens. Don’t abuse insta kill abilities too much since you need 36 out of 40 possible points from unhealed injuries and hook states. Four insta kills max, but should try to only use 2 early on in case a survivor doesn’t get saved. Tunneling a survivor can also help but will lead to DC’s. I’d suggest hooking one person, than another, then once you get someone to a second hook state, finish them after save so you can farm the last three easier.
---
At that point, it’s just about locking down the three closest gens, paying attention to hook states so you don’t end the game too fast, and then the hardest part, trying to deny hatch if you lost two gens. You’ll most likely have to slug and hope you can find both people again or set up a trap, but I have no other advice.
---
Also, don’t forget to bring good add ons that don’t take away from emblem score and maybe even a map offering if you can. And apologies if you find this too lengthy.
---

---
He can’t down with his power anymore anyway. Has to finish them with an m1.
---
Lol
---
This nerf hasn't even happened and still has to go through testing. 
---
Live legion could be different from ptb legion. No one knows, everyone just assumes.
---
There's testing for a reason.
---
thankyouforparticipay the tunetay
---
Because this community fucking sucks dude. They thrive off of outrage. Honestly, these Legion changes seem perfectly fine, and we won't know for sure until we get a chance to play them. Either way, it wouldn't be DBD if people weren't flying off the fucking handle at every little thing. It's insane.
---
Lullaby for the dark is free on all platforms
---
OoO is fine wym
---
I agree, but your shit is just adding to their shit. It's not much better
---
I meant it does a good job of wasting *survivor's* time. Because when they're snapping out of it, they aren't doing objectives. Paired with addons, it's pretty difficult to get anything done as Survivor if you're facing a Doc who can hit shock therapy.
---
I laughed harder than I should have.

---
I mean instead of a deep wounds timer which doesn't make a lot of logical sense the hit should just be ignored all together like Mettle of Man. Either way you'll still have to chase them down.
---
ANNOYED THAT ALL I SEE IS PLAGUES AND I HATE GOING AGAINST THEM BECAUSE ITS SUCH A BORING KILLER!
---
I don't care much for how the addons affect things, I've always hated spending them. And I'm not particularly worried about legion being weak, I'm sure they'll come out fine, I just hope for them to be more interesting than just another m1 killer with an easy first-hit.
---
They only stack up to 100%. One violet offering and then a yellow or a brown one is enough to reach max. All the others become waste

We all know that 99% of the changes that go on the PTB make it to live. We asked for legion to be nerfed into the ground and that’s what we got. Devs are too busy for a full legion rework because they have Freddy’s rework to work on, so we have to deal with this shitty legion until they can rework them.
---
I'm not reading all that.. Tl;Dr?
---
Einstein said "if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"
---
Why are you a baby who can’t adapt?
---
Show me these 99% stats you speak of, cause from my experience, each ptb is more fun than the live variant.
---
It costs the doctor a nontrivial amount of time to use shock therapy though. You waste more survivor time by just hitting them.
---
Like doc he makes the survivors scream in pain and mess up skill checks
---
So’s hot sauce to the dick hole. Both hurt just as much
---
the perk does nothing out of SWF. leave it be
---
Then allow me to explain it simply. It's a game, it's meant to be fun for everyone. Being toxic is not fun, makes people go bye bye, game dies. simple enough?
---
Sheep block should be much higher. A good freddy knows how to use dream transition to mindgame survivors. After freddies last invisibility period he is visible for 0.7 seconds before becomeing visible. Sheep block reduces this to 0.2 seconds. This is huge and is debateibly better than pill bottle due to the shorter transition time, the ability to give false information to the survivor, and the fact its a grey addon!
---
I don’t think anyone has the actual stats of what changes make it to live, except the devs. I’m actually using something called a “hyperbole”. Point is, the majority of changes from PTB make it to the live servers. This legion “rework” isn’t gonna be healthy for them. It only nerfs an already shit killer.
---
Finally! A Tru3 meme not dissing tru3. Tru3ly great.
---
Someone sauce me up on the image in bottom right.
---
i’m not sure what you mean
---
Ironic. You post a list, that doesn't even look like a list, but a massive mess of text about toxicity (?)
---
And then respond like that. 
---
Obviously don't want a discussion, carry on.
---
I'm bringing attention to your use of the word "literally," mate. Legion *is* literally playable. Speaking of which... 
---
Unless you're rank 16 or less, de-ranking to rank 20 is (actually) literally impossible.
---
I’m so proud of this community
---
the entire thing is, yes I failed to format properly, you came in with your comment instead of saying hey.. can you fix the format? Came off as being toxic and sarcastic to me.
---
lol how is anyone suprised at what they did? with the amount of tears everyone cried pre-nerf you could supply Flint with clean water for a few weeks. they’re literally giving the whiners what they ask for.
---
Yes, it's like sticking a Carolina Reapers in your ass while inserting Hot sauce into your own urethra by sticking a straw in it and pouring hot sauce down the straw. Also while Hulk Hogan proceeds to slap your nutsack continuously.
---
It was a joke, but still. The devour hope takes 5 hooks to kill one person. Where the mori only takes 1 and devour hope can be destroyed.
---
And the comment of the month award goes to
---
You didn’t really address the other two points at all. 110ms was something many many complained about since his launch, and we’ll have to see what his speed is in ptb to truly see if the extended duration is a waste of a change. My bad about the TR, I don’t have the character as I really don’t like his design but I should have read into it more.
---
Yes
---
how do I protect enough gens for iridescent without being able to use ruin for an entire 9 minutes? how do I drank without getting banned?
---
i am someone who sucks at looping &amp; winning chases; i barely ever get hit by nurses. sure she ignores pallet mindgames, but her chases are just one long pallet loop.
---
if you want to learn to play against nurse, either start playing her or play matches against her
---
Okay good to know :)

Of course

Thanks for letting me know man lol

It's a coward behind a new account. Kiddo must be mad about something
---
Lil Thor!
---
I mean.... BBQ is amazing, lithe is one of the best exhaustion perks in the game and bamboozle is pretty good..... The only perk I'd say isn't good is boil over
---
Actually, according to the lore, you don't die, you run back to the campfire and start another obstacle. I believe it's the same for those who are killed, and those who escape.
---
I agree,  no one wants to get face camped a entire match. Tonight I've played 7 matches,  and have only escaped ONE time. Due to camping,  and tunneling. It's super annoying,  then everyone says "JuSt LeAvE tHeM tO dIe" not everyone wants to watch their friends and team mates die on their first hook. 
---
I've been playing other games a lot more,  and this less and less. It's tiring not getting to have ANY fun.
---
Who dates insultes mes *huffs and puffs
---
In two months
---
That is indeed what they did.
---
What do you mean. I play in SWF and we all experienced this. Literally in a locker prior to the hook and the killer goes right to the hook. 
---
Wondering if a Killer Main has noticed this or maybe they don’t want to say anything.
---
Awe yea, I’m loving this meme format
---
Hmp hmp hmm hmm!
---
Lmao my dude.
---
The basic idea of this killer was cool but honestly it ended up being a colossal failure in practice. They can’t just completely take out a killer so this was the result.
---
M j o l n i r
---
"Enjoy being the poster child for contraception" is my new favorite burn. Thank you good sir.
---
-BBQ is good
---
-Lithe is the worst exhaustion perk in the game (2nd worst if we count Head On)
---
-Bamboozle is not worth a perk-slot
---
*FBI grabs battering ram*
---
How can you track the first person down after hitting the second with no scratch marks and being turned around and also no heart beat?
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT, EVERY GAME WHERE NOTHING HAPPENS IN THE LOADING SCREEN, EVERYONE LOADS IN, IT'S JUST FINE. BUT WHEN I TALK TO EVERYONE LIKE "HEY LET'S STACK STREAMERS/LUCK OFFERINGS/SABO SQUAD" THE GAME CRASHES!!!!
---
They know if you dc on purpose and they specifically say reporting it is a waste of your time.
---
I WAS A KILLER MAIN A FEW SEASONS AGO, AND IF SOMEONE GOT FARMED I WOULD DOWN THEM AGAIN RIGHT AWAY SO THEY FARMER WOULD LOVE BENEVOLENT POINTS, THEN I WOULD JUST SLUG THEM THERE AND NEVER GO BACK, LETTING SOMEONE GET THEM BACK UP. BUT I WOULD TUNNEL THE FUCK OUT OF THE FARMER.
---
Yeah he needed a rework because of his near nessesity to tunnel to down a survivor, and how he destroyed any counterplay due to moonwalking and vaulting shenanigans. This is a hard nerf to his ability while still allowing both of those things to happen, and it makes tunneling even more of a nessecity I would say.
---
so you can decide wether to run away or crouch up to us. its all about making your choice
---
Decisive is still very good with the 5 second stun. It seems to be mettle of man, adrenaline, decisive and maybe deliverance
---
Bubba is a great killer, but it’s just the timing of having to spend five dollars for one of the three great perks when only for a little while later for it to come up in the shrine of secrets, where you could purchase one of the great perks without spending actual money. It’s still cool to help the devs out for the great game and what not. It’s just timing lol
---
The light didn’t just die, it was aborted

KILLERS LIKE FREDDY AND WRAITH ARE LOWER-TIER DUE TO THEM BEING 'FIRST HIT KILLERS' WHICH LEGION IS ABOUT TO BE. THE BASE DESIGN OF HIS ABILITY IS INDEED FLAWED AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE DISCOURSE AND WHATNOT AS LONG AS IT REMAINS THAT WAY DUE TO IT'S INHERENT DIFFICULTY TO BALANCE.
---
No, I dislike mount Ormond because it causes frame drops and lag spikes. It can also spawn an infinite and scratch marks are hard to see. It's also gigantic as fuck like mothers dwelling and yamaokas estate, so if my teammates are hooked on the other side of the map I'm going to have to run a mile to get to them. Auras are just a part of the list.
---
Oops sorry, was too lazy to read the whole thing.
---
the plague: "am i a joke to you"
---
Nooooo, I didn’t want it translated to normal speak,I just like the gibberish
---
Because there’s not much allocation in this game unless you’re gonna one trick one killer. In any case being p3 doesn’t add value to any argument to your stance. It’s like talking about your rank in terms of balance. Anyone who can see these changes and knows how legion plays can understand these proposals are stripping what makes them unique and at all interesting to even pick up. This version we are looking at is the one thing I hoped we’d never get, and that’s just homogenization. The doesn’t feel like some murder happy knife flailing maniac, this is just the Sprinting Borrowed Time Giver.
---
Lets be honest, in rank 20 they cant even hit skill checks so i dont have to worry.
---
what if i dc so someone can get hatch
---
Those of us with integrity approach this game more like OP.  I'm a killer main and think the killer in question was babykiller trash for camping and hard tunneling off hook into mori.  That's basically bumper bowling for your kills and is completely devoid of skill.  Not all of us killers approach the game like pieces of shit.  Some of us would rather flex by beating our opponents in fair competitive matches and asserting our dominance over them in a fun well fought game for both sides.
---
Big Disgrace

Killers have been receiving the overwhelming majority of the balance love the past 8 months what rock have you been hiding under?  Everything the Pallet Vacuum update on has been to buff killer and nerf survivor.  Your post is both incredibly outdated and completely tone deaf when objectively looking at the state of the games balance for killer at present.
---
I've been completely bamboozled by someone before as Legion. They're definitely hard to counter but not impossible.
---
Tru3 was one of the first strictly DBD content creators i ever watched and i had to unsubscribe from his YouTube because he was so consistently negative. that man is incredibly good at what he does but it seemed like every time i'd pull up one of his videos he'd found yet another thing to complain about, and it feels like he doesn't think anyone else's opinion on the game are that valid unless it aligns with his.
---
like, props to him for having the viewership he does, he's obviously doing *something* right, but i couldn't keep that attitude with my main game all the time, i'd be burnt out in two seconds flat.
---
The Dev's say to not do it as their system tracks it, but I think I'll start reporting people too.
---
Holy shit yo
---
80% of my entertainment in this game comes from the shit people pull in the middle of matches, it's gold sometimes i swear.
---
People are going to do what they want, a lot of people play scummy not much to be done. 
---
Until they change them accept mori=death
---
Been posted many times lol
---
About 90% of my entertainment from this game comes in the form of the shit people pull inside matches and immediately following the post game chat logs. Gold sometimes man
---
Probably the same guy as those other LegionTears accounts.
---
"minus?"
---
That comment was a joke
---
Legit the main, if not only reason, why i hate versing her, really wish they'd change it but maybe it's intentional idk kev
---
If he’s literally turning his power into the plague then just make him the plague
---
And dead ‘ard
---
Most people are going to be happy with the changes.
---
Legion/killer mains are just mad that they have to learn something new, or put in some more effort to get a 4k.
---
they should get on this
---
I dont understand the issue
---
MoM, adrenaline, BL/lithe &amp; DS/WGLF(for farming hooked survs).
---
Pretty cringeworthy
---
IDK IF IM ALLOWED TO POST TWICE BUT I AM: I JUST PLAYED /5/ GAMES BACK TO BACK WHERE THE KILLERS DID NOTHING BUT TUNNEL AND FACECAMP. LITERALLY IGNORING ANYONE ELSE RUNNING NEAR THEM TO GO TOWARDS THE ALREADY HURT/DOWNED PERSON. PLEASE GET BETTER AT PLAYING THE GAME. THIS IS WHY YOU ONLY EVER GET 2KS MAX PER MATCH. YOUD HAVE MORE FUN IF YOU THOUGHT FOR A SECOND WHILE PLAYING KILLER.
---
So you are telling other killers to stop using Ruin because that makes it so the survivors you face when you use ruin can hit great skill checks like nothing? An entitled bitch is what you are.
---
You’re roleplaying some like pirate witch hunter, it’s a lil weird
---
Then buff him, I'm not complaining.
---
Lmao I love how I know where that legion mask pic is from since I'm considering making a legion cosplay
---
And this is my point. Many people are leaving the game, because it is no longer fun. Not asking for killers to be super nice, far from it. I want to be kept on my toes, given a hard game. Not an easy game for the killer. 
---
Killers lose out on points, and rank now, but mori off the first hook. Camping cost you emblem points. I have been playing other games now as well, but do not plan on quitting dbd.
---
Template by /u/zombiehuggerr
---
Apply deep wound status effect but knee will not start if your in the killers terror radius in a chase or NOT in a chase. That is basically borrowed time but even worse for the killer.
---
BRING STREAMERS THEY SAID. WE'LL FARM THEY SAID. YEAH YOU'LL FARM AFTER YOU LET ME DIE AND POINT AT ME.
---
It's a weird effect of the way that hits work. 
---
When you swing, the game checks an area in-front of you for any survivors, then it zooms you onto the closest one in range. If you touch them, you deal damage. Sprint burst lets the survivor outrun the zoom and escape the area after already being locked onto, but before the hit is confirmed.
---
*cues Immigrant*
---
Agreed
---
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO LEGION ?IDK IF ITS GOOD, BAD , SHIT OR WHATEVER IT WAS JUST SUDDEN TO READ THOSE "CHANGES"
---
I’m pretty sure this isn’t true. I haven’t noticed anyone in lockers in any of my recent killer matches using BBQ, unless they step into it too late or out of it too early.
---
I'm guilty of enjoying Legion's design and character. Sorry.
---
I thought i was about how they blame everyone of cheating
---
And you sir, are the ones I enjoy getting beaten by. I am not asking for an easy game, nor am I asking to "win" the game. I have been beaten by many amazingly good killers, who have outplayed me so hard and so fast, without camping or tunneling. Game was over super fast, but I still said GG, because it was. 
---
Never said he is wrong. His goal is to kill, but he won't get much emblem chase, nor will he get much in devout. This means he will not pip. He had just over 200 hours in the game, could be a new account, or could just be newer to the game. 
---
Point being, as a killer main myself, I expect a good, hard earning of my winning, or theirs. Easy games should be saved for kyf, real games, even competitive games, should be saved for live. Having been in red ranks for most of the seasons until now as survivor, and purple to red as killer, I know how rough the game can be at higher ranks. I also know that "quick" games are not rewarding to long enjoyment of the game, nor is it rewarding to your rank.
---
I've yet to hear one person be happy about the change. It may not be everyone but it's a loud portion that could cause the changes to be reverted leaving the same issue as before
---
welcome to the Tru3munity
---
Ok? How often does deep wounds down people when you aren't abusing the moonwalk?
---
To be honest a lot of legion mains hate him now because he wasn’t as op as he once was, ie franks mixtape, his original movement speed it’s really dumb and childish because like you said, his power now wastes time.
---
and your THAT kind of killer main(the killer equivalant of what everyone thinks when they hear the words, survivor main).
---
ruin is just a bad perk for slowing down gens. yes we have few options but why use the one that forces survs to hit greats. just use curropt intervention. not only can it not be disabled within 2s of the match starting, but it flat out stops gens from being done.
---
i play both surv and killer, but lean towards the latter. every time ive gone against ruin i find myself hitting more and more greats, making the perk do nothing &amp; give me an advantage without it. And when i have used ruin, nothing has changed. 3 gens still pop while im in my first chase.
---
and yes, this is based on my experience. i dont know how your games go, but i can still look at the perk from the middle ground. it hurts killers as much as it hurts new survs.
---
Try to save bloodpoints by learning how to make the entity eat chuncks of the web.  If you arn't allready that will at least make the grind easier.  If you play killer priorities perks that give you more bp,  you more or less want a farming build, may be out of date but i use doctor with bbq, and distressing.  When you play just play for the blood points kick the gens, breack pallets and shock the kids even in a game that you just get sacked you should earn a ton of bp.
---
Sounds like he's just a good billy player. Maybe he switched from xbox or pc to PS4 or made a smurf account for whatever reason.
---
Sprinting to the gen on the other side of the map is a typical billy start. Sprinting back to the other hook after hooking someone new is also normal, as most survivors will try to rescue while the killer hooks someone else.
---
Did you try to heal near the hook? He probably heard one of your characters.
---
Did your friend heal you completly? Otherwise he probably found the blood trail and found you that way.
---
Even if you were healed, if someone was unhooked and healed up and as a killer you find someone else near the hook it's pretty clear that your hook escaper cannot have gotten far, so checking the area is pretty common.
---
Without seeing the match and only from your description i'd say he's just an experienced killer that had luck on his side, rather than a hacker.
---
My teammates are gonna trigger it when they go unhook me :)
---
WHY THE FUCK IS DOING BLOODWEBS  ABSOLUTE EAR RAPE AT THE VOLUME THAT THE REST OF THE GAME IS FINE??? LITERALLY HAVE TO TAKE OFF MY HEADPHONES TO BUY
---
She hasn’t left the nut
---
bABy iM yOURs iNT3Ns1fIEs
---
They could've just had the deep wound timer pause when in the terror radius and nerfed Frank's and left it at that. Instead they nerfed basically everything about their power including how fast it is (it might not be much of a distance closer now, especially with the stun at the end that no longer body blocks).
---
I mean if you played how you say you did, then the nerfs probably won't affect you very much. They can still Frenzy from one survivor to the next, they just have better move-speed for securing the kill without Frenzy now. They can't down with Frenzy but if you say you didn't tunnel with their power then I'm not sure what you could be talking about other than chasing in normal to secure, which they'll be better at after the update.
---
It’s useless. U miss ONE TIME and your stunned why take that gamble for a deep wound that won’t work 99% of the time instead of doing a regular hit and not getting a huge penalty?
---
Im with you on this, i definitely like having longer power range, i use the green add on for it and when searching just hold M2 and drag it across grass like sonar except shitter.
---
How often does Legion miss a feral frenzy lunge? That lunge is wider than clown himself. Sure you miss it deactivated but it's punishing you for a bad play
---
I fucking hate this sub
---
everyone acts like legion is the most op character in any game ever and then everyone fucking whines when he gets nerved, fucking decide what you want or stfu
---
You forgot that the Plague takes some Pepto Bismol and and Ranitidine before the fucking match. Also gets plastic surgery to fix the right side of her face and resume life as Nea Karlsson.
---
well riperoni
---
The lunge range is true yeah and as for end game i really like Rancor/Remember me combo, and then its all about baits, but as the last gen approaches i prioritise getting them to sleep, once that gen pops and none of them are wounded they have 0 ways of waking up so hooks are safe.
---
WHERE IS SHE!
---
I don't think all that is true about BHVR. I think they have a very difficult game to balance and they put too many difficult ideas into Legion, and ended up with something that didn't really do any of it right.
---
Legion nerf = use mori every game
---
or maybe they get in the locker to late, ive seen people do it
---
Then complain about that. That single thing. The speed. Then his power allows him to be a distance closer, a power with a reward of being a easy speedy boi but with a few risks to counter its strength. When the ptb comes out and we all get to see, if the speed isn't good for distance closing anymore then say that change needs to be reverted. Also his stun hasn't body blocked for awhile.
---
I've had two games where the killer (both billies) went straight to the locker after hook.
---
Wow, of all the times i watched him i never understood that until now. So much thanks!
---
It’s way easier to dodge an LF chainsaw. Good luck running billy around a small structure, his increased speed while charging it almost ensures that you’re going down.
---
I guess so! I’ve always heard people saying it works against a DC then says it doesn’t. It was like I was almostttt finished with the Mori animation and they DCd.  Keep trying!
---
Are you kidding me? Spirit with prayer beads and thrill is the easiest way to do this achievement. Nothing to be proud of.
---
Decisive isn’t toxic at all anymore. It only punishes killers who try and play scummy. It’s still viable so I’d use it in the build the other comments mentioned, but it’s not toxic at all.
---
there is a post around on the subreddit with patch notes but as far as I remember the changes are
---
* 110% movespeed increased to 115%
---
* Terror radius increased to 32m
---
* rebalanced addons
---
* survivors with deep wound timer don't lose progress bar when they are within terror radius of the killer or when mending (as opposed to not losing it only while being in chase or mending like before)
---
* legion can't see how close to bleeding out survivors are, only if they are deep wounded or not, the progress bar is visible only to survivors
---
* his power's movement speed is to be significantly reduced, with power duration increased
---
* legion can activate his power only with full power bar now (like spirit)
---
* if he misses a hit during frenzy his power is instantly cancelled 
---
* additional hits during feral frenzy do not lower the bleed out timer, basically if you hit someone in feral frenzy  more than one time the additional hits do nothing.
---
basically while reading it many people thought 'stop hitting him, he's already dead' halfway through the list only to realize that the list goes on for another 5 nerfs
---
God I hate doing item builds and bringing the coin to get 2 extra chests and having my team scavenge all the chests. Ffs I will give you something good just lemme open it
---
I don't think that Flint would want salty water tho
---
Thank you!!  I might want to mess around with it a little more. I just got really lucky.  I want to see how well I can do it without prayer beads and having just a random ol map.
---
This made my day LOL
---
This is exactly how I play. If I have 2 people hooked and I see a 3rd person running, I'll usually just hit them once and then let them go and then destroy gens or something like that. There are times as well when there are 2 people left with one gen remaining where one person is hooked. I'll just stand in a corner or something and either let them complete the gen or try to go for the save. Once one of those actions happen then I'll start chasing. Another time I go pretty chill is once I know I achieved ruthless killer, I'll take the rest of the game slowly
---
'aight just ignore 90% of what I've said and respond to the thing at the very end. Nice talk.
---
Upvote for Ginosaji :)
---
Ok...whats your point?
---
If you paired OoO with Distortion, does it just suck up all your tokens every time you look at the killer until you run out?
---
Thats the strat dude, long range is very underrated.
---
Ty, but I have 100%, just curious about this particular mechanic, didn't know it is possible
---
I mean the first two things you said are coming. But you only get one hit if you miss.
---
Deep wounds has the power it has because people really don't like the idea of their life hanging by a timer. Plus if it really isn't that much of a threat they can always reduce the amount of time the timer is until it is a threat. Hence why they ask for community feedback and do ptb's.
---
And eh, I never liked blood hound on my legion so the blood change doesn't really bother me.
---
What of it?  It may be the easiest way for the achievement but I went in not even thinking this would give me a trophy.  I don’t trophy hunt. But I did something Monto and other really great killers have suggested and didn’t fail first time around- so yes I CAN BE PROUD OF IT.   
---
Take your negative shit somewhere else. People like you literally feed on taking enjoyment out of others lives. I don’t get it.  I cannot relate. But please, go away... you wouldn’t be this ballsy to someone’s face so don’t do it on the internet.
---
Yes, me neither. I can’t see why that worked. I feel like because there was a sliver left and it counted it.
---
Which is why I keep going back to the theory that this is somehow a regional difference. I don't see the potatoes that often, and when they do show up It shows. They start throwing down pallets like there's no tomorrow, they sometimes straight up run into nothing, and just in general lose a loop on the second rotation every time. And winning against these guys feels like a cheat, slaughtering babies is not fun at all.
---
Those little shits in red ranks for Monto - almost never.
---
Those hardcore "swfs" for Tru3 -  bruh, they probably aren't even "swf".
---
It will down you, you dumbass. You proposed that the attack counts as a normal hit to "balance it". 
---
You are literally arguing in defense of a power that is just an unavoidable normal attack. 
---
&gt;Either way, we’re now talking about an attack that has nearly twice the stun time of any other missed attack.
---
So if you are not utterly shit at the game and manage to do the ungodly feat of hitting someone by pressing mouse 1 with aim assist that this game has, you won't miss the attack and won't be punished with the stun.
---
Range addons should not stack. Her addons should bring her no higher than 3 blinks.
---
Any sensible person would know that old legion wasnt that good as it was. Almost nobody asked for a nerf, but a rework. Idk who you are talking to saying lesson is OP (op is not the same as broken due to exploits). We wanted a rework, not another goddamn freddy.
---
I felt it was the principle. It takes forever for killer sided things to get reworked, while survivor sided things get fixed within a few months and not a minor fix a very obvious nerf takes place. It just seems that if survivors complain enough they can get their way unlike killers( survivor main btw).
---
Krieg isn't a normal psycho though, he still has a voice of reason in his mind
---
THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING?!
---
Funnily enough, even when I go against red ranks, I STILL usually kick their asses.
---
I am on PS4, so maybe most PS4 players just can't play well?
---
This has happened a few times for me as well on PS4
---
Is it funny? How much are you laughing?  Tell me the joke! I want to laugh, too.   It’s not like I did something no one has ever done before. I’m not gloating tremendously-  ... I play my spirit once a week MAYBE. First time ever using devour.  
---
Tell me, how long have you been getting on peoples cases for things that have nothing remotely to do with you personally? Do you just dog people out to make yourself feel better?  Go away from me kid.
---
🤣!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yeah not a killer main but play a good amount of killer. Im not gonna listen to some reddit rando where i dont know your skill level or rank you play at.
---
You keep telling me to “go away” and keep responding to my comments? Is that some twitch thot wannabe logic that I don’t understand?)
---
Happened to me on ps4 on multiple different occasions and I've tried different things but nothing seems to fix it other than starting another match. It's still playable like that but just extremely difficult.
---
Why do you want a toxic build?
---
Not saying remove the hatch, I'm saying allow the killer to close the hatch. Why am I punished for finding it first? That's stupid.
---
never seen that Jake top
---
he always looks a fucking mess, if you have to use a cam at least dress nice or fix your face :/
---
Okay google, how do I delete someone's Reddit-post?
---
^(fuck you us Ace-gamers dont deserve this)
---
Well considering the fact that it says right there that feral frenzies speed will be "Considerably reduced" sounds like it won't be anywhere as good as it was to catch up to survivors.
---
I used to play an online fighting game. It was easy to gauge new/ weaker players. Often i would go easy on them and let them win a few times so they wouldn’t be completely discouraged from ever playing again, which is why i eventually stopped playing that game as well. Too many people would use animation stuns to chain attacks that would instantly kill you to the point where playing felt pointless. The point is i’m not alway gonna play my hardest against noobs who run in a straight line or get farmed off the hook because getting tunneled/ camped gives you that same hopeless feeling of not wanting to play again. Even though survivors are all assholes who Tbag me when i give them a free escape i think it’s still something to keep in mind... unless your a douche the entire match then i reserve the right to be a dick right back.
---
How many of us thought he was speaking Gaelic?
---
Toxic 🙃
---
Actually Hag approved Feng, watch it again :D
---
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE FREDDY A LITTLE BIT (LIKE WRAITH) OR SOME SORT OF SHADOW OR WIND. DREAM WORLD IS COOL - COMPLETELY INVISIBLE SUCKS.
---
Abusing game mechanics
---
I mean.... why are y'all complainin? yeah he can be a fair killer depending on the person but, but the odds of that are almost 50/50, I dont want 50 percent of my matches against a legion thats a tunneling douche. I'm honestly so happy he is nerfed.
---
Welcome to the tru3mmunity, a pun on community.

Huh

That was fekkin weird

She is worthy. It claudette was there oh man shed be screwed. Or flashlight nea

*Cackles in Joey*
---
Yeah happened to me on PS4. Can’t turn left or right without getting locked in place. Only reason why I would dc is because of this glitch. Very annoying.

---
Kate has 2 climbing axes on her winter pants
---
Those are for climbing, but I get your point.
---
As a survivor I just want to live. I'm not great at looping but I'm practicing. With killer though I'm nice as crap when survivors aren't winning. I'll usually will turn around on people I dont want tunneled but I will tunnel toxic survivors. I'll camp them too because if they want toxic that's what they will get. Other wise I'm decent. I let people go sometimes even if I can get them because I'm running noed or something. I at least get 1 pip with these practices most of the time. It feels good to not treat survivors how killers treat me.
---
Yeah I've always heard camelots
---
Lmao
---
I on the other hand do have all the dlc. The thing is I dont want to level all my killers to 40.
---
Well chainsaws are for cutting trees but you can still kill a motherfucker
---
Well that’s the metal of man
---
Where'd you go
---
Everyone hates a good trapper
---
Problem with devour hope(or pretty much any hex perk) is that they get cleansed instantly because totem spawns are awesome. But when devour hope survives, oh boy you have a lot of fun!
---
Just die then.
---
Tell that to me in rank 15.
---
Cosmetic cash grabs are supported by the DBD community smh
---
There is another great thing you can do. You can disappear into the fog and she can't see you. I forgot what the perk was called. I think it started with a D and ended with a C
---
Some players do that so killers don't prepare and take lightborn/franklin desmise
---
I want to disarm it
---
"If I sound pleased about this, it's only cause my programers made this my default tone of voice. I'm actually quite depressed!"
---
Lmao I love how the screen exists on a different plane of reality
---
Oh wow yup
---
STOP CROUCHING ALL THE TIME TO "SAVE" YOUR. SPRINT BURST!!!!!!!!!!!
---
IF USING THIS PERK MAKES YOU GO ON BASE SPEED EVERYWHERE. THEN THE TIME YOU WASTE WHILE NOT RUNNING. IS IN NO WAY MADE UP FOR BY THE TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE OF DODGING THE KILLER'S FIRST HIT
---
Still won lol
---
No. I haven't noticed this. I dont run a killer unless I have bbq. What I do notice is people getting in too late. I have had the game glitch before though and I see them standing straight like a locker but it's a rare event. Like its happened once or twice.
---
Yep i can tell
---
This is written poorly. It's a wall of text. I can say that atleast 40% of the people that would have read it otherwise will choose not to after their initial reaction that this post shares the shape of a loaf of bread.
---
Take some breaks, space out what you want to say. I'm sure the message you want us to understand can be more concise. 
---
3 man games aren't how the game was designed, you shouldn't expect that game to go well if the killer isn't nice. Some people just want to move on to their next game.
---
Nice insult. You’re so well mannered! You’re mother raised you well... didn’t she?  Enjoy the block.   Why are you the way that you are?
---
I’m sorry I don’t follow. What does that mean?
---
Yeah, i won with it by doing 2 gens then hiding behind a tree next to the gates, opened it and ran away, the nurse had NoeD so i was lucky, so its 100% possible to win
---
Yea no i’m not going thru that. Instant out for me
---
That happened to other people too so i guess its not that rare
---
BING BONG BINGBONG
---
Still responding and no even “go away” line? I’m disappointed. So it’s okay for you to throw out “negative shit”, “kid”, etc but I can’t point out that you show off your tits on the internet? Nice :)
---
I know, I want to try it without thrill and without ruin. I want the challenge!

---
Lmao I need to fix that, 😂
---
What you should do: Buy each lvl one perk, when it's a shitty perk after you have it on lvl 3 it never appear again. So better a shit perk than no perk.
---
Lol I see r34 photo over here
---
he's a great killer and he's made some enjoyable content but his mentality is so obnoxious to me imo
---
it's like i can't tune into a stream for longer than two seconds without seeing him complaining about how the enemy survivors are toxic and have "big egos" or "god complexes" because one of them t-bagged for 0.5 seconds
---
The bloodweb is a load of shit sometimes. A killer can become useless without the right perks, in higher ranks at least
---
I kid you not, I had this in 6 games one after the other yesterday. Fortunately in 2 games we had nice killers, didn't tunnel, didn't camp, we didn't escape but they were good games
---
When you dc your teammate is almost guaranteed the hatch.
---
lmao
---
I only enjoy his content when I'm in a very specific mood, but I agree with this 100%
---
&gt; just rational and sure of what he says
---
hmmmm he's quite emotional in my opinion even if he likes to say of himself being "rational". 
---
For exemple his view on balance is focus on the fact he should be able to compete with good swf with any killer. Which is far from being rational since obviously it would kill the other half of the player base that don't play in swf.
---
It depends on how early. You could just eat the hook anyways and keep the BP.
---
Welcome to the ... What?
---
Serious question, how often do people dc against you? How do you react when it happens?
---
_He's not Elise from Hell's Kitchen_
---
Even if this was a bannable offense, do you really think he was actually recording you?
---
I feel like many people don't realise that this is a nerf to the playstile that the community hated and a buff to the intended playstile. Legion becomming 4.6m/s movement speed is a big deal.
---
They will now be viable without their power. Also, think about this: is it worth healing up for legion after the rework?
---
I honestly wouldn't know. He will still get a free hit, but you don't want to be injured with a 115% killer.
---
It's definitely a buff to the way I used to play legion. I didn't hit people with Frenzy when they already had deep wounds and now this will become the best way to play legion.
---
I understand that it seems like a huge nerf, this is what I tought at first too. But thinking about it more, I really think this is going to work and the devs really reacted well to the legion feedback:
---
Moonwalking no longer works, survivors are no longer on a timer when in a chase and I think legion will still be viable.
---
Of course, only time will tell is this actually works out or not
---
I'd say 50%, but he is on a live platform, make yourself more presentable or remove the cam haha :')

Most people rejected His message. They hated Jesus because He told them the truth.
---
I don't think deep wounds has all that much power without the exploits. It's just an annoyance and a small delay but ruin is still better for that. 
---
I guess the real plus side is that exposure perks are going to be more effective because you'll be using regular attacks far more often and the movespeed increase but still. We'll have to wait and see, maybe the reworked add-ons will make Legion threatening.
---
to me its bad because I ran distressing because it meant I could find more survivors, and free blood points. now it punishes me for following my objective, which is to attack more survivors?
---
The traps would be a lot worse without the camera swing. It makes the survivors run into it briefly which is what allows for the instant teleport hits, since she can't lunge after tp. 
---
It's definitely intended, in the tool tips for the Hag it mentions that the traps disorient the survivors. It's needed on a non-mechanical level too, because otherwise you could run past a trap and have it go off without even seeing it, and continue running as the BWAH fades into the distance- not a very scary interaction.
---
Ok good talk.
---
LOL I’m being serious wahhhh
---
I like how people say it without actually playing changed legion. The same was when people theorized The Spirit would be shit just by looking at her description.
---
i think 1/3 of the frenzy would be perfect.
---
It's okay, I've played for a year, main Jeff and are a metal fan, and I only just noticed the other week his perk names and how they relate - *breakdown* and *distortion.* 
---
Felt pretty silly.
---
I hadn't noticed the Trapper face, but I often end up squinting at everything on my tv. I'm keeping an eye out for it now.
---
Shallub
---
well i was with my rank 4 buddy(i'm 6 atm) yesterday in swf, we were getting rank 18 killers and yellow rank survivors several matches in a row. that was disgusting.
---
Amanda players are by far the most vocal of any killer main. Not saying it's bad though.
---
Sono chi no sadame!!!!
---
Well as a freddy main all I will say is use the Chinese grade tools that are given and still get called a hacker after 4k 5gen game.
---
It's not the size of the wepon but how you use it
---
r/UnexpectedThanos
---
You already move at 110% of survivors and with feral frenzy it only went up to 132%. It may say considerably, but they dont have much room for change on that.
---
How the fuck did he get mjölnir
---
7 seconds fedora man bad dude. He's F tier, Tyde said so
---
No dude youve gotta tunnel with double blocks and get one kill at the end with NOED then complain he's trash thats how you play Freddy
---
&gt;Well it’s not a competition, fact is, this matchmaking is dumb and whether it’s a big level gap or not this is something that should be fixed.
---
Well, it is not a competition and this isn't something new. Live with it or quit.
---
Having every Adept achievement and every killer related achievement does actually require some modicum of skill? Like the Nurse and Freddy achievements aren’t easy, Legion can be difficult.
---
Killing all 4 survivors with T3 Evil Within? Not an easy feat at all as it’s so easy to get the hatch; that requires skill too.
---
So while what you say may be true to you the achievements a person has ARE directly indicative of their skill as if they have some much harder achievements than you it’s extremely likely they’re also a better player.
---
Now begone, thot
---
I feel the same way. He seems like one of those really unintelligent guys who think they know everything. He constantly blames the sound when he fucks up and he's so fucking scared to rank up because he's terrified of good survivors. Cringe fest
---
&gt;Lol just because it isn’t new doesn’t mean it isn’t a problem. If you have the mentality of deal with it or leave then nothing will ever get fixed.
---
The thing is, from what we can tell, recently devs have been tirelessly working on the matchmaking. This is a known "issue". People making multiple daily reposts with screenshots is just annoying. 
---
Even more annoying when the MM is not that bad, like yours.
---
This is pretty cool. Has a nice feeling of dread to it.
---
So should SWF just mean a killer might as well go afk because he should have no chance against them ? 
---
In my opinion they should buff killer and solo survivor by making something like empathy a base ability of survivors as SWF groups know where everyone else is anyway.
---
Thank you for the 2-month, you get to keep the camels and linkage welcome to the tunetay. Shalub guys.
---
Almost 9 months you mean?
---
I'm pretty sure he'll be viable 4.6m/s is a very decent buff. They got rid of the uncounterable bullshit and I think they mamaged to keep him viable. Just think about this:
---
Is it worth healing up with Legion now? I honestly wouldn't know the answer. He still gets a free first hit, but you don't want to be injured with a 115% movementspeed killer.
---
I think legion will be around the powerlevel of leatherface and the plague.
---
Tru3munity
---
Seriously it's been so long I need this in my life BHVR

You need to know it, though.
---
What's wrong with lery's as a huntress?
---
So many windows, or as i call them, free hatchet hits.
---
Okay, I'm gonna say it: The trap looks like vagina.  
---
Keep on dude!
---
Try Haddonfield next ,what a nice map.

You can see your ping before the match.
---
You do know that right?
---
didn't people figure out a way to reset your rank without affecting any other progress. That was possible, and would have happened regardless of in-game depip limits.
---
Who is the killer?
---
Do you think it’s huntress?
---
Who is it?
---
Who do you think it is?
---
* 1 minute passes and still running around no clip edits OOF*
---
Do you think it’s Freddy?
---
Every video and this guy doesn’t even have the man parts to edit it, the guy is on fucking PC and I can do better edits on my ps4. True literally will show  beginning gameplay/commentary with nothing happening and him sounding like he has Tourette’s in almost all his videos because it’s PAINFULLY obvious he is trying to multi-task streaming/talking/playing which turns him into a broken record when talking.
---
It’s literally a statistic that the more multi-tasking the more likely you will suffer in other areas, not working out for you bro! Leave it to the ADHD kids that can actually juggle without breaking a sweat for the love of god and edit out your beginning commentary.
---
As killer if I had a crushing victory I’ll give hatch unless I’m playing Legion. If I get outplayed I know when I’m beaten and I don’t chase into exit gates or do hatchoffs. I at least try not to intentionally tunnel but sometimes 60 seconds is a little longer than it feels. When I go to survivor I at least make hard decisions. I will sacrifice myself 7/10 if I can get 1-2 WGLF stacks out of it, I’ll bodyblock and go out into danger so others can feel safe to exist. 
---
This is huge after rank reset too. People in mid green are hella scared to do the first thing. They’re still clinging to stealth and hate chases so I start the game, get on a gen and get it in. Also I think killers in that rank bracket like it too because patrolling in the early game is kinda unnerving cause you don’t want to lose a gen cause you didn’t have a decent tracking perk.
---
I prefer Huntress, love girls who are twice larger than me and probably have a cock
---
Remember guys.
---
SHAAAALOOOOOOM.
---
OMG thank you!
---
For like news and stuff the forums are really good bc that’s directly where the devs post upcoming updates but stickied tabs at the top of the subreddit will have the same info a couple minutes after any forum post is up
---
Or chasing a survivor close to the hooked survivor, and that chased survivor never thinks to, you know, lead the killer away from the hooked survivor so they can be freed.
---
Change, not rape and toss aside.
---
I couldn't care less that he got over-nerfed. He was broken and not fun to play against. I don't understand the sub reaction - I can only put it down to the whiny legion mains who just assisted in inflating the problem by denying all problems.
---
People would d/c like mad with legion. Or they would have a really boring game.
---
It is better to balance someone bottom up and being able to have fun than top down.
---
These legion-ites will calm down eventually and realise that to be good with a killer you should need skill.
---
Because its something that affects survivors, not killers
---
This is me but usually as survivor if I played like enough of an arse enough during the game then I just do it to the point of me getting sacrificed in the end. Usually sooner in the match than later. Something about screwing with the killer and then getting sacrificed for it gets me lol
---
He’s would definitely have aimed for the head.
---
Yes, in this anaology, even people like you can 'try' to make a donut out of shit.
---
IMO legion already was a piece of shit. You can't polish a turd.
---
Its Wretched Shop
---
Well he is a lot better than legion after the patch that's for sure
---
Honestly? i was thinking of coming back to DbD cuz i liked legion (NOT THE CHEESE SHIT AKA MOONWALK/BLADE) but now...i already struggled to even do freddy rituals with how bad he is....legion will be hell to play
---
thanks :)
---
Shalom
---
Dont think for a second that the bigger terror radius helps Legion. People already tried it with Distressing. That few extra seconds due to the smaller radius for the surprise hit MADE Legion work. Youre not zooming, youre even slower then before.
---
Implying most Cannibal players don't already do that.
---
But wasn't that always the point of his power to begin with? To pressure survivors and keep them off gens?
---
Thus why i compared him to pig.
---
I get that some people 'want' a killer with chase winning powers but his power is more akin to Doctor and Pig in that he simply adds pressure on Survivors to keep them off of gens.
---
Having diversity in killers and what they excel at isn't inherently a bad thing. It may not be what you personally would like if you prefer chase power focus, but it's not inherently bad. And doesn't make them useless. It just means their playstyle is different.
---
And that's why i always hover over my huntress with iridescent hatchets and a mori equipped,ruin and BBQ too btw,can't flashlight if you are dead
---
Arggh! DC when you're a Billy on Lerys? No! Fuck that shit, be a fucking grownup and play out the goddamn match.
---
Everyone is like you. Everyone is like "well I only have two or three very specific reasons I DC, I'm not like those other animals". So thenyou get in a match with one guy who *only ever* DCs if he gets downed in the first 3 seconds, one guy that *only ever* DCs versus nurse, and one guy that *only ever* DC's when it's The Game, and then the one survivor who ISN'T a fucking trash person winds up playing alone.
---
This mentality you are pushing is toxic, and it's what makes the game shit. Stop.
---
This same thing happened to me lol. I bought his DLC last weekend when it was on sale... Oh well, seems like it is a fun killer and I am loving Franklin's Demise more than I thought, so it was worth it for me.
---
I don't get why people are complaining. They did not like the moonwalking and that you were on a timer during a chase. BHVR removed these strategies and made other strategies more viable by giving him an 4.6m/s movement speed.
---
Yes there were a lot of nerfs, but they were all to the aspects of legion that the community disliked. I don't see legion becomming freddy tier. I think he will be at the powerlevel of leatherface and plague
---
Cute!
---
I dont like it
---
I love it
---
when you are the bubba who doesnt facecamp, you get rewarded with godly powers
---
Absolute blasphemy
---
How do you know he is obliderated. I'm not the biggest fan of BHVR, but I think they did a pretty good job this time. Most aspects of legion that were hated were removed and they give him a 4.6m/s movement speed. He got a buff to the non-cheese strategies
---
It’s should be both similar to Plague. You get hit and a timer starts, as the timer ticks down, your healing and repair speed go down and you get louder for doing things while Deeply Wounded. 
---
Like imagine a 45 second timer that every 8 seconds you lose 10% healing and repairing speed and get that much louder until you mend and it lingers after mending until you heal to full.
---
Is that what the fuck it is? "Aye you get the bits and keys to the shagoon and the bjjftkgsgkkfdukodsikbfsaf thanks man"
---
Dock it with a sock.
---
Idk dont judge me.
---
Nice joke.
---
I feel like I remember him saying he has a mild form of tourretes, idk tho
---
Damn, you really formatted that with a bullet point and everything
---
This is just dumb. Plenty of us wanted him nerfed, reworked or just fixed, that didn't mean we wanted them completely removed and turned into an M1 killer with no power. We wanted a BALANCED, FUN killer, and they shot way too far from broken one way to broken another.
---
Anyone here saw the Michael Myres "Wish" mask?
---
Ooh yeah I think that's it. I forgot Tinkerer removed their terror radius.
---
10/10 would stand in and fail escape attempts several times
---
Thanks that's what I was looking for, I should have made it more clear, appreciate your help
---
If u ask me I think legion was fine. I play on console so he couldn’t really moonwalk on me. I think spirits the one who needs rework.
---
90% of the player base don't play against good nurses. Because they take skill and generally will be very high ranked. You are also still able to escape the nurse - it is based on survivor and killer movements not just killer.
---
Legion did not take skill.
---
Again.. It is not about going against a 'hard' killer- it is that legion removed any feeling that you had a chance in the whole game, making it not fun. That is based on the mechanics - not just how good a killer is, or how nice the killer is being to you.
---
Thanks appreciate it
---
If you have Thrill of The Hunt and your mori still gets destroyed.
---
You’re probably hungry.
---
Video proof?
---
The main issue is that he's worse than Plague in literally every way. Easier time getting rid of the game stall that's much harder to hit, and no OP ranged attack afterwards. ~~To be fair Plague honestly needs some nerfing.~~
---
IS THAT WHAT HE FUCKING SAYS?!
---
Thank you, very cool.
---
You lost your credibility when you said Leatherface and Plague were at a similiar tier.
---
See the thing is they could've easily removed the moonwalking exploit *without* yeeting Legion into the stratosphere.
---
I can pretty much agree with everything here, though I could definitely see some disagreements on the visual aspect.
---
I will say that Legion's idea was really cool.  I love the idea of just going crazy and stabbing a bunch of Survivors to slow the generators and get your downs in the short period of carnage afterwards.  It's a shame that their stall has always been laughable tbh.
---
Also, I trust this Subreddit's opinion on balance about as much as trust BHVRs.  I know I'm not an all-knowing god of balance or anything like that, but when someone says Clown is good I generally have a feeling they only read the power description.
---
The intended playstyle was to frenzy hit someone, look where other survivors are and run there, with your frenzy. With your decreased frenzy speed, why bother running there now? Just do the safe play, down that one survivor and then keep looking for the rest.
---
As far as i know, no. You need to use either a mori or a tombstone if youre playing myers.
---
I believe it has to be by your hand, a reverse bear trap kill does not count as a kill by your hand. I hope this answers your question.
---
What I recommend for getting this achievement is using devour hope together with thrill of the hunt. No ruin is in the game so no one will bother getting your totems. You get a notification every time someone does touch one of them and if you already have 3 stacks you get to instadown them. 
---
Good luck!
---
“Chapter 12 teaser”
---
The official forum has some important things being discussed but at the same time, I've move on from there cause it feels like 70% more toxic than here.
---
Who am I joking, I'm here for the memes lol
---
To be honest this is literally what happened. Too many people going "waaaaaaaaaaan Legion OP waaaaaaaaan" without providing any constructive feedback beyond "Legion OP waaaaaaaaan."
---
I honestly blame myself for not taking the time to create a writeup of what I'd like to see for Legion. Legion needs a reason to break pallets but that reason *shouldn't* be "they're a default Killer."
---
What other strategies? Please, elaborate, because right now it's literally just another M1 killer.
---
Because the killer Freddy puts a survivor to sleep :)
---
Noice dead ard
---
In my opinion if you have the right perks on Freddy he’s not that bad. Have to be honest I’m a Freddy main and I find him easier to get a 4K with then anyone else
---
yikes, what if they go through my data, see that i play legion occasionally, and see that back in christmas I used to use the combo all the time and then I thought "hm today i will go back to my old roots and use my old legion set up" and then hit with that ban hammer
---
It doesn't matter who the killer is if you disconnect you're worse than said killer especially if they aren't playing toxic and are just being smart and you just aren't good enough to win
---
Trapper had an addons update, it was ...alright but damn  does the character ever need some love.
---
you could preview that in the shop... but i see why it would be more handy in-game.
---
WOULD YOU ENJOY SOME CHEESE, WITH THAT WHINE.
---
Mori + Mixtape. Easiest DC ever.
---
Its always annoying seeing someone get the hatch for free, even if its yourself and thats probably why he was mad

not really, the deep wound effect is basically useless in its current form, you run slower, can't miss even 1 time so its extremely easy to juke and after you get the first hit with deep wound you can't use your power at all because the only thing that will happen after hitting deep wounded survivor with your power will be stunning yourself. He's just a trapper without traps right now, sure you might sometimes get easier first hit on a survivor, but thats all. Deep wound is useless and frenzy works only for 1 hit and is much much weaker than it used to be to the point it might as well be removed.
---
Oh and I forgot to mention that you will no longer be able to see blood pools during frenzy, but it doesn't matter because there is literally no reason to chase in frenzy after an injured survivor
---
They shut down the game, take our money, change their names and live a life of lavish. Constantly on the run.
---
I was gunna say do you see your load out? You wanted them to DC lmao
---
Aw rip
---
It ended up being on Lerys against a Legion. Everyone escaped.
---
Haters will say its photoshop.
---
He’s got normal movement speed now and so people will have to think about staying injured against him. 
---
But oh wait, people playing him actually have to think when chasing now instead of just getting free hits even when you missed several swings, or exploiting the mend bullshit, or using Franks for even more braindead hits.
---
Will you just leave Freddy alone.
---
You may be sending the wrong vibe but your last sentence of, “...especially since he messaged ME attempting to taunt me for disconnecting.” Is fishy af. It sounds like you are trying to play the victim card. I’ll just pretend like that isn’t a possibility and just continue. Prior experience as killer wont help you knowing exactly what he saw. Urban doesn’t make you harder to see, alls it does is make you faster. I’m almost hundred percent sure that he heard you or saw you in his peripheral vision. PS4 hackers are far and few between. He was probably just a Smurf.
---
Corrupt Purge also completely denies unhooks because she will down both survivors with a single puke stream. 
---
I always try to play the entire match without cleansing but, if I see other survivors cleansing as soon as they can, I start doing it as well because there is no point staying injured when other people gave her Corrupt Purge. Might as well heal and try to make her waste a little time hitting me twice with her puke.
---
I agree. I thought he needed to be nerfed, but not literally into the ground. Hopefully they see they went a little too far and make him stronger

Haters gotta hate am I right?
---
Franks + Dirt and you’re actually wondering why?
---
Has to be a Mori.
---
IMAGINE BEING MAD BECAUSE A KILLER KILLED YOU
---
SALTY SURVIVOR MAIN KEEP RANTING
---
Ye
---
So you are saying this achievement is much better to do with tombstone Myers because it's harder for the survivors to tell what's happening?
---
wait what, there's a stream today?
---
I don’t get it. 5 people now understand what you mean when you said that but they didn’t take off their downvotes.
---
Happened to me twice on xbox
---
I’m a Freddy main. I love him, and I’ll play him and adapt despite whatever happens. He’s my favorite
---
Is huntress thicc tho?
---
This isn’t how this term is supposed to be used.
---
Playing against Freddy is a bitch
---
fastest dc in the west
---
"Blog post and video". Doesn't sound like a live stream. Next week is a live stream planned (Q&amp;A).
---
Only noobs use that button, so I wouldn’t know it
---
Do it
---
Cutcoin is toxic af. Most pointless offering
---
Well, with shadowplay and relive it's a given that you're constantly recorded.
---
I JUST BOUGHT MY LEGION A LOVELY NEW OUTFIT AND BHVR HAD TO COME ALONG AND BEAT THEM TO DEATH.
---
Killer is host so if he unplugs he can make it as if the match never happened. I haven't had it happened but ive heard here that if a killer disconnects his internet during the match you only get like 5000 points
---
You are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of killer.
---
Yea true, solo seems the way to go
---
People forget BHVR is just a bunch of people making a fun game. They're doing their best, but even if the do everything perfect, they will still be bombarded for some random shit. If you're reading this BHVR, we love you and all the hate stems from a passionate love of your game.
---
I’m very curious as to what this will mean.  It’s a huge issue that survivors just wait around for nothing in particular.
---
Cool clip but you gotta shorten that down that was like a whole game
---
lol wat
---
i waited for a match as a rank 11 killer for 30 minutes today
---
She wasn't really buffed that much, and I actually remember people saying that she should have 115% or she will be worthless
---
I play without mori but if you manage to down them fast enough they still dc in rank 5+
---
DO YA THINK SO?
---
That's not a bad idea actually I think I'll try making some hard candy.
---
Space Coconut is a hag main with tutorials on how to trap maps
---
Before that they would release shirtless Myers, take in the millions they make off of it and then dip before they get slapped with that fat lawsuit.
---
*god damnit BHVR*
---
You’re the kind of person who complains about “gen rushing” when you refuse to put any pressure on gens or survivors because you just tunnel the one dude blindly all game, aren’t you?
---
That would be unbelievably broken and unfair,not mentioning it would get spammed by killers and ruin the survivors experience.
---
The only time I run a cut coin is when I'm doing something gimmicky and protecting the chests, no items for ANYONE
---
hi, i made account because i had same error in my last game, there is a screenshot:

And they're running Object of Obsession so they know where everything is.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I enjoy his content, commentary and discussions immensely. He has very valid reasons and always explanations for things he says or how he feels. I may not always agree with him, but that's individualism. 
---
I'm perplexed by how many people in these comments act entitled and egotistical. It's ironic that you say "he has a god complex", "complains a lot" etc, yet you're hiding behind a device trying to belittle and dehumanise someone for just being an individual with their own opinions and thoughts, who has a job WHERE HE SHARES IT WITH PEOPLE!
---
We weren't born to like or agree with everyone and everything, but that doesn't give you a right to be the exact thing you're claiming someone else is...

She's an absolute unit
---
Keep us posted
---
They all have adrenaline, MoM, dead hard, and ds.
---
Mcote gets 2 ds though. Make him extra wiggly when he gets caught.
---
THIS GAME IS AS SHITTY AS THE COMMUNITY, FUCK ALL OF YOU CUCKS!
---
I'm pretty sure he's saying "pop" as in, "up you pop."
---
fuck i just realized i could have added shadow dance into the title as well
---
ah well, too late
---
Use your *imagination.*
---
Only people who have tru3 tal3nt
---
I love how he called you toxic and your response upped the level of condescension and toxicity. Well done. Also you definitely did support DCing in your post, so maybe you should make sure you comprehend what you yourself wrote before posting.
---
Man that would be actually really cool
---
Yeah, i thought so too
---
Again just a regular wiff cooldown would work
---
Its people who don’t play Freddy and have no idea how his kit works. Legion can hit people at any time, Freddy has to wait 7 seconds at base, and people can easily wake up via self care or gen popping forcing him put them back under. If someone gets downed and other survivors start healing Freddy can’t pick up the slug. Nobody else is Freddytier.
---
This may have been too soon for some.
---
He’s not wrong though, is he? If it’s ok to DC cos you’re a billy on Lerys then it’s ok to DC when you’re against a iridescent head Huntress, or a silent phase walking Spirit? Justification solves literally nothing.
---
No? Then how far appart are they?
---
What if it’s a literal collapse? Like the Trial collapses around you? That would be awesome and would make sense lore-wise.
---
Yep as soon as you downed them They were able to be killed
---
How small are your hands?
---
Honestly don't think they will do anything.
---
You can just lightly turn it. Faster mashing doesn’t make you wiggle faster.
---
Right? Like, the map start to dissolve only to create a new random and final objective with a new random map
---
&gt; line? I’m disappointed. So 
---
Tbh, still don't understand for what reason you want to annoy him but oh well.
---
+1 to Space Coconut on YouTube. The man is a Hag God and makes actual tutorial videos.
---
You just fully shut down your device.
---
I didn't say anything about dying
---
Thanks. :( It felt pretty cruel, PS4 has been brutal lately.
---
That’s half of his shards would be a waste no matter what he did
---
*Wraith standing invisible watching you very slowly die on the hook while everyone just does gens and leaves* 
---
"Holy fuck, this is the most fun I've ever had in my life."
---
Faced a Legion with ebony mori + franks mixtape + dirt with ruin and noed.
---
The 4 of us escaped and we were solo lol . This is why I enjoy being against them so much: guarantee of escape on mostly games
---
Beatable =! Fun to play against. I play the game to have fun, if a killers ability removes the fun, why am I playing?
---
It's not because he needs to land his first attack and because he is slower that he no loger gets a free hit. Afterwards, you chase the survivor in frenzy and bodyblock them. This is a strategy that already worked on 110% legion and I think it will work better with his new version.
---
Also, survivors will have an even harder choice now. With previous legion, you didn't heal since it was just a waste of time, but now, he still has that free hit and in addition has a 115% movement speed. I honestly don't know if you should heal up or not.
---
I just get annoyed at the community losing their shit over this before playing legion. I can't guarentee that he will still be viable, but he still has a decent amount of things going for him and I'd like people to wait for the PTB before getting this angry at the devs. (Not that you sounded angry, but I really think it won't be as bad as people make it out to be)
---
I feel like we should get the stack if someone DCs since it happens so much.
---
Those templates are amazing, good job
---
I always hear 'Camazots and flickish' and then everything else is just gibberish to me

Man i never even knew that was the console control for wiggling. Is it tough to do?

Isn't Sloppy Butcher just a ticket out of dream world with Self Care?

Fookin' Quentan.
---
It’s so true
---
Freddy is defiantly way more fun than leatherface, but 0 times has someone been unhooked disrespectfully in my face as bubba. I see Freddy and I think awesome I'm gonna have to fail a bunch of skill checks because of this shitty version of doctor and I rarely know where he is until he gives me his shitty version of madness. I see leatherface and it's pallets are half as effective unless I get the stun, if I or someone else gets hooked in the basement hes the absolute worst killer to put you there, and being 1 shot as part of his base kit is icing on the cake. If you look at perks all Freddy perks are long game/open gates perks compared to leatherface more so extending the gen process by applying pressure and removing items.
---
It is painful
---
You do realise that he just becomes an m1 killer that gets a free hit at the start of the chase?
---
I loved this dude from back in his Injustice days. One of my top three streamers, along with Destiny and Aris. He's just a really genuine guy. I don't really understand where is detractors are coming from.
---
She can dash at loops, making unsafe pallets impossible and safe pallets unsafe
---
I’ve noticed doctors do it a lot
---
This, once the update goes through I'll actually level him up. Plus, personally, I like player killers who aren't "meta". Which sounds like he won't be from this subs reactions.
---
I'm curious what changes you want. OoO does its job
---
They get the report but it usually doesn’t do anything
---
And it’s a leatherface with insidious in the basement
---
"The show's over"
---
Not sure what you mean by the chases are one long pallet loop. If you are talking about looping smaller pallets, that only works until the Nurse does a double Blink. Maybe you aren’t playing against good Nurses. Either that, or I don’t understand what you are describing.
---
Looks traced :/
---
Got blamed for cheating yesterday. Badham preschool and the hatch was in the building. I was billy, meaning they had literally no way to get to it unless they juked my chainsaw. They did what I expected them to, and finished a generator. Walked over in the general direction of it, spotted and downed her, and was called a cheater
---
Like boii, if I was cheating, why would I waste 5 minutes waiting for you to finish the generator?
---
They look more like drugs
---
It ensured that if legion wasn't a bucket of fucks to play against already, the exploits ensured it would be
---
Was necessary for context. Just fast forward
---
You can't use 's for plurals like that.
---
That black hole is the ultimate God pallie.
---
I just dc as killer when this happen. I ain't gonna spend time to find 1 people who could be literally anywhere. And I'm sure the surv doesn't wants to do 2 gens all by them self
---
Platform: PC  
---
Type: Bugged Terror Radius + Animations  
---
TR was loud and broken (from the start of the game + next game). Restarting the game resolved the issue, but not the pain caused by such ear rape ;)  
---
Wasnt able to heal a survivor, somehow everyone was connected and if the killer did any action to one survivor, it applied to multiple survivors (one said he couldnt move for 2s once the other survivor got hooked).  
---
[Clip](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/beji9i/would_you_be_able_to_play_like_this_if_that_would/)
---
Well, all survivors mains want Legion deleted, so I hope you are happy now. But Legion might not be the worst, probably the blocking pallets in Frenzy will be a much commom strategy now, because he will have 115% speed.
---
Freddy can be very strong in the right hands and with the right perks. End game is very dangerous with a good freddy. I just wish Adrenaline wouldn't wake survivors up. I be preparing for the end game by putting all survivors asleep and suddenly they all wake up as the last generator gets completed
---
You know how a lot of people who are mediocre tend to think they’re exceptional? A lifetime of arguments on video game forums has revealed to me that the opposite is also quite true: that people who are exceptional have a tendency to think they are just average. Consequently, they also tend to think that any player who can’t meet their standards are “garbage tier” even though they’re just average. So when you say that every Legion will be able to hit every survivor 100% of the time while in Frenzy, I mean it when I say you’re just wrong. What you are describing is a very exceptional Legion who has put in a lot of practice hitting those “simple M1s.” Same with a Nurse (though maybe not as hard). If I were wrong,
---
Legions will miss. Legions will grind to a halt. Survivors who know how to juke will have a huge window of escape. If I were wrong, Leatherface would be top tier because no one would ever bump into anything.
---
What sucks the most, really, is that whoever ends up being camped, was the person that allowed the rest to get the gens done, meaning they'd be better off dying early in the chase in the hopes that the killer won't sit on their face. It's especially infurating if said person ran the killer around for 3-4 gens, and then gets downed by noed 
---
You're basically a sacrificial pawn if you get found with only one generator remaining, and that's what sucks the most - Knowing that if you go down during the last chase, you may very well die on your first hook
---
don't know what to tell you, Suvivors are doing what they're suppose to do when you get an idiot who will camp and they win killers are punished for camping by losing and not getting any points. 
---
Maybe an Single player game is more your speed or you shouldn't be playing a PvP game that requires teamwork and stick to games that you can do solo or will let you respawn.
---
If she crouches, you just run away to a different pallet, easy counter.
---
As a killer main, I understand your point and I don't disagree.  I don't facecamp at all.  When I play I tend to patrol the area of the hook before I go look for other survivors, then I do a quick check back at the hook to make sure nobody went back to unhook.  Most of the time, they'll be unhooked by then and I go after the first survivor I see.  If that's the unhooked survivor, tough luck buddy, you're getting hooked again.  You can call it tunneling if you want, I call it hunting.  I hope you're not advocating me ignoring the obviously already hurt survivor who I found first mind you, just to "have fun"?  That's not something I will ever do, sorry that's not tactically sound.  If I find you, I'mma kill ya.
---
Lets be honest no one said that they should make him viable and fun(at least on the subreddit) everyone said that they should delete him
---
I mean yeah, they’re winning this way. But this shit happens way more than it should. Obviously these people don’t care about points or rank, and everyone else in the game gets punished in the process. The new ranking system makes it very hard to pip without getting chased and doing saves, and if it’s a camping invisible wraith like the above example, you can’t even try and farm chase points. It’s just another additional shitty game in a sea of forced 3 man games.
---
Even with proof the devs wont do anything, could you imagine if everyone who ever lost an offering due to the loading screen bug submitted a ticket with proof wanting there offering back? They would need a team of hundreds to go through all the tickets, find the specific user profile and manually add-in a single offering. It wouldn't be worth it.
---
I haven't burnt an offering of any kind in weeks, as I know as soon as I burn a BPS, or pudding i'll be crashing.
---
Borrowed Time has been significantly Buffed to the point where it is a low-priority, mindless time sink and no longer meets the spirit of a frantic, small time limit to escape until you go down.  Most of the changes to Legion have involved changing Borrowed Time / Deep Wound to address Legion issues. Is there any thought to separate Borrowed Time and Deep Wound into different Statuses?
---
I appreciate this
---
THIS IS THE RAGE THREAD. RANTING IS WHAT IT’S FOR!
---
Yes, you are right, i think i'll just spend more bp on that web
---
Literally half of the Reddit community does nothing but complain. It's what Reddit is for, to have conversations. Why do u think there is flairs for different subjects. I love the game however the things ppl do in the game can be stupid and annoying. And how do u know? I'm sure the devs look at their communities to see what their fans think and feel.
---
Is this real? How often does it happen?
---
Maybe that's the problem. Because it happened so often, nobody had any faith in it. All it took was a single person believing in it!
---
PERKS LIKE RANCOR SHOULDN'T WORK ON SURVIVORS WHO DON'T HAVE OBSESSION PERKS THEMSELVES. EVEN BACK WHEN DS WAS STILL BUSTED AND I NEVER RAN IT, FUCKING RANCOR ALWAYS SHOWS UP AND RUINS THE FUN OF THE GAME. CHEAP. 0 SKILL PERK. REWARDS THE KILLER FOR DOING BADLY. MAKES THE KILLER BEE LINE FOR 1 PERSON AFTER ALL THE GENS ARE DONE. BAD PERK.
---
To be fair, you could play any killer and put the points into leatherface. You're not forced to play him
---
RNG and the ease of waking up. That's really it. Freddy is powerless when survivors are awake and it's easy to wake up. People point to the 7 second transition, but it's just a free hit to start chases most of the time. He lacks built in chase potential, but you really shouldn't be chasing when 4 are up anyway.
---
Second time in a year and a half, I think(And basically ever) - Never rely on the shrine to get the stuff you want
---
Took me over 150 levels to get BBQ in my P3’ed Hag. I had almost every perk level 3 (4 pages) before it showed up.
---
I don't usually camp either, just because I know how it feels, but I completely understand why people do it. I don't care so much about winning in this game, since there's not really a defined "win" for the killer. When I play killer I think of it as me being the host, and I'm there to give everyone a good time while also casually murdering them on the side.
---
If I get to end game and I've killed a few people already I just chase and try to kill them like normal rather than camping, just because it's more fun gameplay for both parties.
---
If I make it to end game and I haven't killed anyone yet, I only chase and even on downing someone I don't usually hook unless I feel I am guaranteed to get multiple people, because I don't want to single anyone out.
---
Of course most survivors don't understand any of this and I get a lot of post game chat hate for being "bad" and whatnot, but I usually just leave if the survivors aren't going to show respect for me and my gameplay choices.
---
I bet legion could've vaulted that *cries*
---
Maybe it was you who disconnect

Not anymore folks! Now the effects will activate as soon as you enter Feral Frenzy.

Freddy is way more than wraith is. He is way more than trapper and leatherface. Cause his power matter while being simular to wraiths he gains something extra out of it. The absolute most consistent tool in the game to prevent the genrush shit ton of information which if you are good is a game ender for survivors at times.
---
Ace is already neglected enough we dont more things that hurt ace mains
---
I just hope when it comes to the ptb ppl will leave very detailed reasons why this and that are good or bad and not something in all caps saying HE SUCKS FIX HIM NOW OR ME WANT REFUND type of shit lol. I’m looking forward to the ptb cause aren’t they testing the dedicated servers in the ptb? As you can see by this link https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57097/developer-update-april-2019 it says first on the PTB, and then, to a segmented percentage of the population on the live environment. This gradual roll out will allow our team to gather data and feedback to ensure the smoothest transition. The first public tests should happen in the next few weeks.
---
*chuckles* I'm sorry, you have me confused with someone that cares about how people view me
---
No. I mean there’s two things I can do at a loop.
---
1. Dash. This works better on the pallet but you can do it outside too
---
2. Bait. If the survivor runs when you crouch, simply crouch and they’ll start to run, then you stand up and catch them off-guard
---
To these claims i always reply with "salt salt salt salt". They usually blame me if having wallhacks because i see them in the distance and guess where they will go. Like gg genious, you played yourself.
---
He wastes too, too much time taking traps and placing them, when survivors have a easily time disarming them. Hag get all her 10 traps at the start of the match, but Trapper get just 1 trap and he needs to waste considerably time to collect the others, while survivors have no problems gen rushing him ? Sometimes, the games go too fast for you to actually bother with your traps, survivors can just Dead Hard through your traps or just walk through them ( because traps hitboxes can be really shitty ) and even if a survivor step in your traps, they can free themselves at the first try if they are lucky enough and after that, they can just loop you like a M1 killer. Because Trapper becomes a M1 killer against good survivors, same with Cannibal.
---
BILLEEEHHHHHH
---
That makes sense
---
We'll see with the ptb but I'm betting on him performing really bad.
---
It's hard to do it with tombstone Myers because you need a lot of stalking to get to tier 3, if you kill someone you haven't fully stalked that means all that stalk goes to waste. You might come short with that. Devour hope is a perk so you can use that every game over and over until you get lucky and it works.
---
Chuck Norris versus the entity
---

---
Space coconut all the way!
---
He is performing decently right now, the real issue with freddy is people dont get the potential of his kit and has therefore fucking refused to learn to use his best things. Its so few people who actually play him in an efficient way (spoiler no tunneling is why people call him bad yet they claim its the only thing he can). Here is how you should play freddy use his aura reading to the max to keep people asleep and use it to find other people. The ganes become slugs while you slowly chip away at the survivors chance of escaping
---
Sorry, must have hit the wrong button or something.
---
First seen survivor is understandable. To go out of your way to search for the unhooked survivor is what I consider tunneling. I have had many killers lately actually slug another survivor to get them out of the way, just to come after me. They had a downed survivor, a free hook, but chose me instead, even though I was fully healed by this point. When a survivor has crap luck of keeping on popping up in front of the killer, I don't expect a killer to go, oh, I hooked you.. you may go. I will let them go, if I feel like it, but I don't avoid hooking someone, unless they have a trap.  
---
Hooking a trapped survivor a second time is pointless to me, as while they are trapped and beeping, they aren't working gens, they want to get the party hat off. I will avoid those at all cost, unless I catch them working on gens rather than removing their hat. I want those who are busy doing objectives, not running around in a panic.   
---
I am not saying don't kill people, nor am I saying let them work on gens, keep them off gens, hook them, but you don't have to be a total toxic person about it either. (not saying you are, just in general). This killer I am referring to right now, in this post, left a chase he was in with an injured survivor, just to come back and camp and tunnel me off first hook for a mori. That is not playing to have fun, that is playing to ruin other peoples game play.
---
Heeeey, i'm the guy who made a "We Will Rock You" joke that spiralled into whatever the fuck this is. bvby, you started this great, staying formal and refrained, &amp; now your acting like a child. Cozy, stop picking fights with strangers &amp; trying to make them feel unaccomplished, because you either aren't great at the game, or just hate spirits. Both of you shut up &amp; focus on better things you can do with your time.
---
THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO SEARCH FOR ONLY GREEN AND YELLOW PING LOBBIES. I'M SICK OF JOINING AND LEAVING RED LOBBIES. I DON'T CARE IF IT FUCKING TAKES LONGER EITHER.
---
This is a civil discussion. I noted that lack of knowledge of why a character is the way it is leads to an ignorance of how hard or soft a nerf is.
---
Now he is just a worse wraith because he has no stealth. 115 movement speed isnt a godlike change that automatically makes characters broken or strong. It's really a baseline set by the game where if they have any speed lower than that they need to have an exceedingly good power. As it stands the changes seem to indicate he has essentially been neutered which is unfortunate because the changes should have been focused on making him viable with counterplay. But they took a few steps in the wrong direction.
---
Arguing for statistical info is silly since the way I see it...they only changed it because survivors dont play against legion. And when I played survivor it was annoying watching teammates drop out, that was on them. I can tell you the devs would not go out of their way to balance against a swf well communicating squad even though many killers refuse to play against that.
---
In fact they made it so you cant tell anymore and cant dodge. Not to mention the recent pallet change seems to have buffed loops again and ruined sounds.
---
Unfortunately game balance as a whole is important as I play both sides so I cant see any reason to continue playing when the freddy rework is also likely to be just as bad as this. He will probably end up about as good as pig at best.
---
We can't let the NSFW die, lads. You know what you must do.
---
I’m so happy to finally know what he’s saying. I only watch his stream once in a while and didn’t want to seem rude by asking what the heck he was saying.
---
Rename it to "Plunderers Demise (or Downfall)."
---
Terrified of good survivors? The fuck youre saying?
---
Damn you pissed
---
Literally whenever he gets outplayed he cries that playing vs good survivors is too hard, and he tries to pip as little as possible to avoid higher ranked survivors
---
At first I thought you meant EndGame collapse and not the Avengers.
---
Omae wa now, shindeiru.
---
I was gonna call it "Dead mans chest" but Avarice sounded way cooler lol.

Name it what you think sounds cool. I dont mind :)

&gt; What do you consider fair though?

Essentially as long as there is meaningful competition involved, it's fair.  And to me, I think fair and fun kind of go hand in hand anyway.  By and large, if something isn't fair then it probably isn't fun.  When you say you would feel cheated if something was done to you, I think that's a good barometer for it being something unfair.
---
I don't like camping or tunnelling off the hook because the survivor you're targeting can't do anything to stop you.  But if you find two survivors later in the game, there's nothing wrong with focusing on the one who has been hooked before because they have a genuine chance of escaping.
---
On the survivor side, I'm opposed to things like BNP squads (as rare as they are) or running whatever pseudo-infinites still exist, because the killer normally doesn't have the chance to do anything about it, at least in a reasonable amount of time.  But looping in general is fine, because there's mechanical and psychological counterplay involved.
---
Is he saying welcome to the community at the end?
---
Then BHVR comes out and announces the point of the Freddy rework was to make him worse for balancing reasons.
---
Only when the killer uses NOED.
---
&gt; Not that rough sex is exactly metal related...
---
If it was, I've been going to the wrong concerts!
---
He avoids piping to avoid longer queue times
---
idk why this is strange?
---
I suppose it’s matter of opinion. The only killer I dislike facing is legion. Every other killer I find it to be a fair and challenging match. 
---
As far as your changes... I’m not sure how I feel about nurses blinks causing deep wounds. I feel like I should dislike that idea but I’m just not sure lmao.
---
It just looks really unnatural in my mind, idk
---
As a survivor main, I seldom run into bad Freddy's. I see nothing wrong with him.
---
I've only gone against two "bad" Freddy players (compared to the others 🤷🏿‍♂️), and even then the trial was some work.
---
I noticed that literally on my first game
---
Do not see him that often. To me he’s just a normal survivor I do prefer Kate though. Never really cared much for him
---
i've seen a few. definitely rare, though. don't really have an opinion, since i've not experienced a lot of matches with Quentins.
---
He played horribly but I'm sure some will watch that and say survivors are broken.
---
Syringe tech?
---
I've seen Quentin as killer only, he's usually toxic to me if not always escapes somehow. But I catch him off hooks quite easily
---
This is the reason I never run save the best for last anymore. That DC must completely ruins it.
---
If I see one he is always p3 and a body blocker.
---
That being said, not really common for me either.
---
I cleans after say like 3 gens get done with my team cause it’s pretty easy to just hide for a couple mins if she takes her power
---
r/shrimpmemes
---
Right!
---
So do a lot of people, including me if they turn out as bad as it seems. But I'm not giving up on Frank yet
---
Or ten dollars for a paid survivor skin that you already had to pay five bucks just to play as.
---
yeah ill check that out and currently im using adobe photoshop :D
---
Last night I played a few fred games and at one point a survivor kept getting skill checks before they even got into the dream state :(
---
I see this being a hilarious and cute web comic
---
Yeah on second thought stay on photoshop if you understand it lol it’s better but usually for people who’ve grown to understand their tablet
---
did a gen pop?
---
WHY ARE THERE PERKS THAT SHOW MY EXACT LOCATION AS A SURVIVOR?! WHY CANT THIS BE A STEALTH GAME AND VICTORY RELY SOLELY ON YOUR ABILITY TO BE SNEAKY/CAMOUFLAGE?! THESE STUPID PERKS ARE RUINING ALL OF THE FUN. ALSO, STOP CAMPING HOOKS KILLERS! FAAAHHHHHHH!!!
---
Remember folks, NSFW doesn't always mean sexy
---
Razzmatazz
---
The speed is insane. I've run it with Double Shadow Dance before.
---
I never see DC's often either, the only times I usually get them is if a survivor decides to tbag the gate but I end up downing them before they can escape.
---
DC'ing is not a bannable offence.
---
Lol I wish other sites had a bunch of subs like Reddit. This play is a cesspool for pussies.
---
Good survivors won't go for the window to give you those free shots. They'll weave in and out of the doors behind walls and high barriers to break LOS. The place is full of walls to hop behind to dodge a hatchet.
---
They look like they’re filled with determination
---
You’re not gonna have a good time
---
N'aw, this looks kinda cute
---
Okay have a great day! 😉
---
Just trying to blend in with the community
---
*Mori's you on top of hatch*
---
"jk ggez"
---
I'm gonna be honest with you pal. You're a huge dick for even saying that.
---
Looks like that's when the PTB comes out, but still good to know!
---
" THE MID-CHAPTER PLAYER TEST BUILD WILL BE LIVE ON APRIL 23RD AND WILL INCLUDE AN UPDATE TO THE LEGION "
---
I tend to disagree cause all in all the killer will usually always find the hatch before you do as they are faster and do not need to worry about getting killed, unlike the survivor.
---
Ultimate Pig buff!
---
Dude this thread is not about freddy though it's about legion 🤦‍♂️
---
My blood pressure won’t be able to handle this.
---
I mean... if they did no gens and still get a hatch chance, they've already got a buff in possible escape. Getting gates powered for free is more o a chance than survivors who did no gens before ever had.
---
that is AWESOME
---
Plague gonna kneel down to reach it
---
Dude I just made a post for this aswell!
---
HELLO THERE I'M NEW PLAYER HERE AND WHY THE FUCK I GET DEPIPED COZ KILLER DC IN FIRST 3 MINUTES OF THE GAME
---
This makes Blood Warden even more dangerous now.
---
It is relevant for the thread 🤦‍♂️
---
By forcing the collapse, you put yourself at a disadvantage (opening an exit gate) while also putting yourself at an advantage (you can score a kill or 2 if you have the right perks). In the YouTube vid, it shows that 4 generators skips to the end game collapse, so I believe that this means killer can choose to start the end game whenever they want during the trial. This would be insanely good for freddy for example (I know he's getting a rework but I'm talking about his current state) where he can force a collapse with all 4 survivor sleeping, bloodwarden to prevent the others from escaping, and use noed to knock them down one by one. This could also be beneficial for pig, where they can't leave if they wanted to anyway if they have a trap on them.
---
Immidiatly going for the guy of the hook when the other survivors give you free hits.
---
that is also true but as I said I hope the devs put the exits pretty far away from each other just my opinion on it anyway. this will be very good for the game and I am looking forward to it
---
Finally. Wish it didnt power exit gates though. Seems like survivors who accomplished nothing all game are getting two potential escapes by hatch or gate now, when before it was nothing.
---
If it works anything like when they toyed with the idea of closing the hatch on the PTB months ago, closing it powers all remaining gens. No idea if it automatically opens the gate. (since normally endgame collapse only starts once a gate is opened)
---
Hate to break the news to you bud but the community as a whole has contributed to "killing" the game over the years not just one side. Theres killers and survivors that are both "killers"
---
Then the gates are powered. It's easier to just slug and take a peak around the map.
---
Tunneling is when the killer goes after the person that just got saved from the hook instead of the person who saved.. giving them little to no chance to plod anything else other than be chased and sit on the hook.
---
I believe as soon as the hatch is closed, the gates can now be opened. At least that’s the way it seemed.
---
Some interesting implications here. Not sure how it'll affect normal gameplay, but the rare endgame hostage situations that can happen will be over, which is good.
---
I'd like to know just how much downing/hooking people during this phase slows down the timer. 3 minutes is already a lot of time.
---
He made sure you...*remembered him*...lel.
---
fair enough I guess
---
still i don't understand what's the benefit if the killer is opening the gate
---
This looks better than what we have, but still pretty bad.
---
1. We can close the hatch, but there's nothing to stop Survivors jumping in before we get there. Plus closing it seems to power the exits, meaning two places they can escape from rather than one.
---
2. The hatch now spawns regardless of how many gens are done. NO. Simply, NO. 3 kills before 2 gens are done is quite difficult at high ranks and should be rewarded. Plus it gives Survivors a goal; get at least 2 gens done ASAP. Now, why bother?
---
3. This lasts way too long. It takes 20 *CUMULATIVE* seconds to open a door, yet Survivors have 3 MINUTES?! That timer should be 90 seconds - 2 minutes. MAX.
---
I was seriously hoping this would REPLACE the hatch, and takes keys with it. But fuck Killers, I guess...
---
With this update (for the people who haven't seen the patch notes) the killer can open the gates (wtf) and close the hatch. But wait, I'm not done yet, when the hatch is closed or the exit gates are opened the game will start a 3 minutes timer where all the gens are blocked and if you don't escape you instantly die
---
Not really an issue when their power is useless now.
---
I can imagine the Freddy Rework now! Think if bloodwarden not only blocks the gate but increases the countdown timer! He would be the ultimate late game killer!
---
Wasn't this posted here like a week ago?
---
If a survivor is slugged in the end game, I know time slows down, but is it still possible for the entity to take them in time while they’re slugged?
---
This looks amazing. 😍
---
That fuck you to the last survivor by blocking off gens and having the killer close hatch is a little weird but other than that, very cool mechanic.
---
Remember Me Trapper makes entity penetrate 4 survivors
---
SO WE JUST GOING to ignore that Hooked survivors slow down the timer? So that means camping is the strategy to have that Unfortunate survivor died. And Killers Have no consequence for The Endgame happening Besides the survivors Escaping. Now survivors are just going look out for themselves n leave each other besides Survive with Friends. BECAUSE NOW u are going Have to re look at No One Escapes Death &amp; Blood Warden to accommodate the endgame coming. Survivors will be helpless for a short time and it's unfair.
---
How is it broken
---
I think it's the update, the ptb way drop a few days before that date.
---
You can find the date on the forums.
---
it seems to happen when the hatch closes, rather than a killer walking to the exit gate and manually doing so.
---
so just depends on if you want to close the hatch or not
---
Oh, I might have misread it then. Thanks b.
---
I'm gonna say the N word....Jk. Fr though DC sucks but that doesnt mean they are faggots.
---
Well I mean, all killers can't be A tier. What would be the point of making a list if you just wanna be nice to everyone? Freddy is absolutely one of the worst killers in the game, along with Wraith and LF. There's really not much to argue there
---
lol blood warden is the meta now.
---
So kinda like when someone farms the person on the hook?
---
"Toxic"
---
the original is 100 times better
---
If survivors are just hiding and stalling out the game opening the gate will activate the timer
---
They've mentioned they're reworking perks, so I imagine that NOED and Rancor for example will proc in endgame, however you happened to get to endgame. Fewer perks made useless by dependence on gens.
---
Who cares that the gens are blocked at the end right ?
---
It looks cool, and it’s an interesting concept. But all it takes is an asshole killer trying to make everyone stay the full 3 minutes for free sacrifices they didn’t earn. Left behind survivors in End Game should NOT count as sacrifices for the killer. Those are Entity kills. It would be the same as when a survivor bleeds out. This paved the way for more potential toxic gameplay and behavior. And 3 minutes is not NEARLY enough time when a killer is face camping a hooked survivor. Which some will still do! And we already found out in PtB that hatch closing was an issue. So why bring it back. Also the fact that the killer can open the gate and activate End Game is pretty unfair too. 
---
Unpopular opinion, downvote me now!
---
Didn't bother to look at the new posts, was too hyped about the idea.
---
Immersed survivors just hiding?
---
All the tea baggers will pay. Bringing in Blood Warden and Remember Me after this.
---
Ahhh that makes sense. Good idea to force the game to end.
---
Yea actually this is the only part I don't like. It will become a camp fest. Doors very often spawn close to each other. A nurse can easl camp both and if she have noed that just happen to be neary the doors there is no way you can escape. Or even without it you still may not be let doing it - she can just hit ppl away and wait for 3 minutes and kill everyone. I really don't like. Now the killers can hold survivors hostage with the doors geez
---
No worries! Honestly I dont think it will be that bad, but I'm confused why additional stabs on the same target dont lower the timer.
---
Also confused why legion cant see the timer now. Makes it way harder for you to prioritize or know if they're hiding in your radius.  Confusing.
---
He didn't say it did, no?
---
Gates should be powered up even if gens are inaccessible, so survivor has 3 minutes to open a gate
---
Killing chasing you, the collapse, and NOED??
---
i’m concerned about noed
---
Indirect noed buff. No time to chill and look for totem, just pray and rip the hooked survivor or everybody dies to try and save him
---
I guess you will need to either open the gates or get a key and re-open the hatch.
---
It’s not but ok
---
It nullifies all the attempts of unhooking a survivor in the endgame, if you try to escape using a key the things get worse because if the killer manages to close the hatch the game is finished, all the gens get blocked and the timer starts
---
Ooooh so THAT'S what he said! I never understood what he was trying to say.
---
I'm not sure all gens have to be done for killer to open the gates, because one of the clips in the video shows 4 generators left turning into the collapse, killer might be able to activate end game whenever they want or that was just a test thing
---
I mean any killer can be strong with the right perks and addons. But if Freddy doesn't work unless you use the best of the best then the general consensus should be that he needs a buff, not people defending him with that kind of reasoning.
---
Closing the hatch powers the gates automatically so you can escape that way
---
I always imagined they're kinda like cookies or M&amp;M's. A small item easy to eat by the handful that the characters monch on to get items.
---
Now how Nurse can monch anything with that pillowcase strapped to her by the neck is a mystery I don't even want to start trying to solve.
---
As someone who enjoys playing as Freddy this makes me excited!
---
The exit gates are powered, I believe
---
My friend and I call them Hams because they kinda look like a slab of meat (at least they do when they are small and pixelated on the PS4)
---
Except calling someone out for having an inferiority complex or being obnoxious, toxic, etc. is not the same thing as having an inferiority complex or being obnoxious, toxic, etc.  
---
As someone who watches his content, you can't honestly sit there and deny that this is the person he is, because that's the person he is. I would know, because I also used to watch him.  
---
Also, unpopular opinion:  
---
Saying "unpopular opinion" is just a way for people to safety-net their own views, so that if they're met with counter-arguments and/or disagreement, they can just fall back into their neatly made crib and learn nothing in the end, because they weren't willing to listen to other people's views in the first place.
---
Killer can manually open a gate.
---
So whats the point of a key now? Is it still possible to get all 4 survivors through the hatch if all 5 gens are done?
---
you know what i meant.
---
the timer slows down if a survivor is hooked or in the dying state
---
Agreed. We love you Behavior.
---
The entity kills the survivor i’m assuming.
---
So if the killer 3ks before the 4th gen can be finished. can they close the hatch? And then as survivor you’re just stuck till you die or is the option to close hatch not available for killer in this scenario?
---
As a doctor main, if you versed me you'd be wishing you were playing against Legion instead. I honestly don't get how Legion can be more annoying than doctor to play against.
---
Didnt they say when one survivor is alive all the gens are blocked off and the hatch spawns no matter the amount of gens completed. Where does the game break part come in?
---
1st ash and now this?! Congrats devs....I’m coming back!
---
It's probably for those scenarios where something like the following happens:
---
Swamp map, thick mist, everyone else has left except for one person who is just urban evading around the map. And unfortunately you don't have whispers equipped. For whatever reason you can't find the hatch. Now you can at least open a gate which are super easy to find and finally hurry that last person out until waiting until they are bored of drawing out the game.
---
Kind of yes, proxy camping is a sign of a tunneler aswell. When I play I kust like to leave or go for the unhooker, no need to be tunneling unless it is the only way left to win, like when the gates are open.
---
As a survivor player...
---
Good. These are good changes, they fix a lot of the endgame issues currently abundant in the game, including dickheads hiding forever and hatch standoffs. it also looks HELLA COOL.
---
I'll have to play around with it in action before forming a proper opinion but 3 minutes seems to be a fair amount of time to escape.
---
On the Legion Update forum post. 
---
PTB goes live on the 23rd. This will likely come to the main game 2 weeks later.
---
I'm a Quentin main, PS4 tho! I liked the character in the Nightmare remake because it was nice to see a helpful character in a horror movie, which inspired me to buy the DLC.
---
He's fairly rare, I live in aus and a lot of japanese players seem to like playing as him, so I see twins every now and again. Lately I've been using his base perks, but I really like Distraction and Empathy on top, usually with Pharmacy and Wake Up. Love my pebble throw Quentin build. 
---
He also has the best P3 cosmetic by far! And a neat beanie.
---
I'm guessing the dream transition will be drastically changed. They're saying it going to be a rework, not a numbers buff. I wish it would be a numbers buff because I enjoy playing him right now, and I don't want the money I spent on him to be wasted after they turn him into another form of trash.
---
It’s a lot more now but it’s not broken, don’t forget the timer slows down when a survivor is hooked.
---
If killer shuts hatch all gens are completed and gates powered. That might be what you saw.
---
It's really not.
---
We must get it right? I mean I will love BHVR until I die for this.
---
For a lad in data, plz explain what this is
---
Killers might just have to hit the gate lever, rather than use it like a survivor would.
---
i wish they would have showed a killer manually doing so then
---
The gates are powered and your only escape is by opening the gates. Unless you have a key, in which case you can just open it right back up.
---
Wait what? I must have missed the part about closing the hatch opening the doors?....uh...tf
---
3 minutes minimum is still a long ass time. If you havnt saved in time gg
---
well, the timer only starts if the killer closes the hatch or if a door is already open. iso that tends to ease the pressure a little
---
That screen shake needs to go though.
---
and you have to really bad if you can't leave an open gate for 2minutes.
---
Also having your whole team escape through the hatch since it only spawns with 1 survivor left alive.
---
Also keys are kinda useless now, lol.
---
its not broken lol, learn what broken means
---
I feel like you're damn near guaranteed a skill check with self care anyways. Increasing the time increases the amount of skill checks sure, but it won't matter as they've already woken up. 
---
Sloppy Butcher helps out after you ditch them, they think they're safe and run to a corner to heal and then you catch up to them without any pallets.
---
Both are good, don't get me wrong.
---
Those animations look great!
---
Very concerned.
---
&gt; We can close the hatch, but there's nothing to stop Survivors jumping in before we get there.
---
Well, that is the point of the hatch.
---
&gt;But fuck Killers, I guess...
---
I was joking that it just baffles me why killers would want to do that, not survivors.
---
He's one of the upcoming DLC fighters.
---
You can't unhook while in madness 3 so it's easy to be a pile of shit with this character.
---
I didn’t even hear about not being able to see the meter. That seems kind of unnecessary to remove, but whatever.
---
Depends on where you live. My area has nothing but awful weather and enough litter to fill the grand canyon.
---
are we a battle royale now, bois?
---
This will make doing totems during the match more of a priority, is all.
---
Great, now we have to deal with noed while gens are still up.
---
I'll have you know I think shes pretty neat.
---
I think the idea is to force survivors to run around to look for the hatch, drastically increasing the chance of a chase instead of having literally as long as they want to immerse around looking for the hatch and leaving the killer bored out of their mind.  
---
I've literally afk'd for like 8+ minutes before the survivor finds the hatch. It's super irritating. Guaranteeing the search only lasts for 3 minutes and the survivor is a bit more likely to be less stealthy due to time limit is worth the tradeoff imo.
---
Nurse is kind of her own issue and will probably need to be addressed at some point. I'm a killer main but I can't do more than one or two games with Nurse, she's a bit too rote.
---
Ooh. Idk, might have been forced in the coding for the video. Very curious if they let the killer open a gate at any time to force the end game. Could lead to some interesting builds and play styles!!
---
Holy crap. I just realized this could be a massive buff for NOED. 
---
Killer downs someone with NOED, hooks them, add Blood Warden for extra pressure.  Killer opens gate themselve to start Collapse. Survivors are probably now both franctically trying to save their teammate and find the NOED totem all while the timer is ticking.
---
The pressure increases majorly.
---
Take Blood Warden. You down a survivor and other survivors 99% the gates. You open the gates, hook the downed one - BW active, end game collapse begins.  
---
And you're playing Pig who left 2 traps for the end.
---
 Have fun!
---
It is way easier for the killer to find the hatch though just to force that timer and camp the doors esp on small maps
---
&gt; This lasts way too long. It takes 20 CUMULATIVE seconds to open a door, yet Survivors have 3 MINUTES?! That timer should be 90 seconds - 2 minutes. MAX.
---
Now think about this, only one survivor remaining, killer found the hatch before survivor but doesn't close it just yet, wait for the survivor to find the hatch to close it, now the last survivor has 3 (2 in your case) minute to lose the killer in a chase, open the gate and exit.
---
Also some map (coldwind for exemple) have exit door that can spawn really close to each other, sometime on the same wall of the map, the killer just have to patrol both while the collapse is going on and it's free real estate
---
You can open the gates to force the survivors out if they refuse to leave. Alternatively, you can open the gates to apply pressure with perks like Bloodwarden. For instance, you down somebody, open a gate to start the Eng Game Collapse, and then hook the Survivor you downed to block the gates for a minute.
---
I thought all the fountains reset once all of them are used
---
Bob3
---
I also missed that too. It's a bit confusing.
---
I like big bellys, i love it. Give me more
---
He said ace in the hole, which increases luck and the Devs said luck had nothing to do with loot
---
I am very excited for this.
---
I mean the hatch would not be open if the survivors did get the gens done. for the 1v1 I do agree
---
Technically no since they all get finished
---
Is that an Entity claw at the end of the match or are you excited to see this change like me? SCHWING!
---
What I want to know is if the killer closes the hatch are survivors able to re open it if they have a key?
---
You pretty much nailed it.
---
I would guess to hit it the once, otherwise time is wasted and the survivor can easily use that time to open the other gate or look for and escape through the hatch (if it isn't closed).
---
I can't wait for all the toxic shit this will bring to solo survivors. I guess I haven't suffered enough already..?
---
i mean that's how you have to play to 2 pip and it's logical since it actually reflect your skill contrary to proxy camping and tunneling.
---
Definitely overkill. Attaching link to the post if you want to check the changes in their entirety. 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57702/the-legion-update
---
I would DC aswell, agreed on the annoying part
---
1. Boohoo survivor found hatch first give me my kill.
---
2. To be honest I kind of agree and disagree at the same time, since the killer can now close the hatch, but you do have a point.
---
3. Why would they want to remove the endgame unhooks and intense chases? With only 90 seconds there's no way you'd be able to make any saves.
---
Seems so.
---
Please give killers daily rituals for opening gates :D
---
Yeah, my guess is the delaying builds from Trapper or Pig or certain perks are the main reason for the gate needing to be opened.
---
How could a killer keep everyone hostage? Survivors would have the same options as they do now.
---
If they're face camping everyone else gets a free escape.
---
I very much doubt they'll give killers kill credit for it. Even a mori gives you less than a normal kill.
---
Equip blood warden and ha survivor in dying state until the last minute before hooking = Altruistic survivors shall die
---
So....TIL
---
Ace in the hole doesn't increase luck. It gives you an addon on your found item.
---
Bloodwarden for one.
---
Aaand closing the hatch makes a reappearance! Also, WOW! That animation when the timer runs out and they get grabbed by the Entity... terribly good!
---
Yeah cause he looks like a fuckin gremlin
---
I didnt have to do that though, either DC or leave the game.
---
A key can re-open the hatch, yes. The hatch will still spawn under normal circumstances when there are multiple Survivors in the trial. The only change to hatch spawning is that it will *always* appear when there is only one Survivor remaining, regardless of how many generators have been completed.
---
Nah, they aren't clueless.  They are just deaf to the minority of their playerbase.  Gotta appeal to the survivor mains and SWF darlings who make up the majority of their user base.
---
Gotta keep selling those cosmetics.
---
I believe it still spawns with the same rules as before + whenever there's only one survivor regardless of gens
---
Correct.
---
Oof
---
Playing Killers gonna be so easy now. All you have to do is stay away from gates, survivors won't be able to leave til they are able teabag you at the gate and they'll die waiting for the killer. EZ PZ
---
in which country ?
---
Isn't that up the ante? Or am I mixing the two
---
time to actually plan ahead of the game to deal with noed and have like 2 people work on gens, 1 searching for totems while another one is being chased or also looking for totems.  
---
noed has never rly been an issue for decendly skilled survs cuz at the time the gate is open most (if not all) totems are already cleansed. ;)
---
Well for a start you can lose the doctor in a chase.. And this isn't me saying that you aren't a good chaser, it is just that it is physically possible to lose the doctor. Sure you can let out a random scream - but if you a quick to find a safe spot to snap out of it then this isn't a problem. 
---
If you are talking about walking around shocking the floor looking for people then you are just wrong. This is not the same to me. There lots of abilities and perks that can help killers locate survivors.
---
Legion is a special case scenario for me. It isn't just an OP to NERF issue. He wasn't technically OP. Chase and stealth were removed from the game if you play against him. Once he is on you, you know there is nothing you can do. It is surprising how fast this sucks the fun from the game.
---
The devs made a bold move but they made the right one. Freezing 1/15th of the game to sort this out is completely justified in my opinion.
---
Eh, I've gone against a few docs with the addon and I'm pretty sure it does technically "transfer". (Doc's stain goes out when it is on you)
---
I mean, does it really hurt when the killer dcs at the start of a match? At this point the match is over unlike survs who only fuck their team over
---
I think it's when the gates are powered, which is when the last gen is done.
---
ive seen a few quentins. in my experience the rarest survivor is tapp
---
Highly likely, that's the literal function of that item.
---
Replying to come back later
---
Seems to happen on all platforms.
---
Ahh, got it. Thanks for the quick response.
---
They probably would taste like blood though. Blood that was turned into triangular stones.
---
Either that or they would taste like cherry.
---
Honestly I have good games with freddy I dont think hes in as bad a place as people say. That being said, I'll be really happy if the freddy rework makes him stronger overall.
---
Yes....**YESSS!** Finally being a toxic dweeb and holding the game hostage or refusing to leave even when the killer has stopped actively pursuing you has consequences.
---
I just like playing freddy in his current state. I'm not saying he is in a good spot, but I sure as hell will miss the guy
---
I think you are mixing them up, I am pretty sure.
---
Gg ez
---
Now this perk that gives u gen repair speed when everyone is dead will be useless I guess cause all the gens will be blocked anyway. /if the killer finds the hatch
---
The endgame collapse triggers only when the gates are opened, not when powered if I understood correctly.
---
Timer stopping is the only thing that will make others come back for you. 
---
So ignore camping, if it didn't stop, everyone basically has to leave you else they all die
---
As he should be.
---
You come into #MY# house, insult #MY# red triangles
---
5 minutes? for me lately it takes 15 lmao
---
If all the gens are done who tf just stands around and not open the exit gates ? This is very unbelievable I've been playing this game for a while now and have never seen this happen... the whole point is to escape.
---
They sure can. If you've ever had a group of Survivors who stick around and refuse to leave, you can now force them out.
---
This is beautiful
---
Well apparently gens are blocked so if the hatch is closed, there's nothing left. The idea of the rework is to change the onus of action from killer to survivor. This means within the next 3 minutes they HAVE to try and open an exit gate meaning you can find them and then force them off. 
---
And since you closed the hatch, they're dead at that point. The usual survivor tactic of "stall, stall, stall" is not going to work. They can't loop you while also looking for a hatch that gives them an instant escape. They would need to actually legit juke you so they can interact with the gate and they are the ones feeling the pressure of a time limit for once.
---
true guess they will need to rework it

First of all I didn’t downvote you, secondly, that got one upvote  and you can’t refresh posts. I wanted to show the bs but literally no one saw it. So there.
---
nah someone named elisa joy
---
Agreed !
---
Isn’t going to matter, a 3 minute doomsday clock with exit gates spawned next to each other going up against trapper/hag  is a fat RIP.
---
Essentially the end game meta will become “ whoever finds the hatch first” otherwise survival rate dramatically decreases if closed.
---
Really love how BE pretends perks like Left Behind don’t exist and then slap us in the face with a bad Bloodweb system for gaining the perks I WANT.

---
Not what I expected to see today but, I am not disappointed in the slightest.
---
If the killers don’t open the door the same way they close the door at then end of the original saw I’m gonna be disappointed but overall I love this
---
Maybe the animation for it isn't finished yet. They had the hatch closing animation in the game since Clown's PTB update.
---
Ds really wasn't that bad imo
---
I've ran into alot of killers dc yesterday, but maybe because rank reset is still relatively new? I feel like normal it's the survivors that DC but yesterday on PS4 it was the killers
---
Oh my bad then
---
I hope noed will be reworked.
---
Exactly I'm telling her she is really good at drawing but she has very low confidence for  her art
---
So, if theres only one survivor left:
---
\-Killer closes the hatch -&gt; -All generators are blocked (endgame) -&gt; Game over for survivor?
---
Peanuts answered, hatch still spawns with normal rules. 
---
It just will ALWAYS open for the last survivor regardless of completed generators. So opening it with a key is still an option.
---
You mean the standard price of $20, and then 10 DLCs that range from $5 to $8 each totaling almost $100 for the "main portions of the game?" That's $100 per person just to get the characters, nothing to do with cosmetics. That's a lot of income.  
---
The whole reason I've bought tons of stash tabs and other crap in PoE is because their game is free and I feel like I'm contributing to extending the game's life by doing so. If I had to purchase the game, I would not be inclined to buy near as many (if at all) of the microtransactions.  
---
You cannot ignore this fact.
---
But the gates are powered, so it's still the same scenario.
---
Plus, in this case, one gate is already opened.
---
Lithe, adrenaline, iron will, urban, get heals from teammates or when the gens are finished.
---
When I play with adrenaline I only worry about healing if the killer is def going to go after me otherwise I just work on gens till I find someone to heal me. I started doing that as a challenge because I was going through a period of not escaping ever and I felt like it actually kinda helped me escape more.
---
I can see the good guy killer memes already...
---
all gens get powered up when hatch is closed, gives you the chance to get a door open
---
Slug racing
---
This whole thing just feels like a huge killer buff in many regards. The constant nerfing of the survivors meta is getting annoying.
---
ptb is out next week
---
I think they just mean open the gate by closing the hatch
---
This actually seems awesome, fuck everything about hatch standoffs.
---
I really like how this is set to express the Entity's presence in trials a little more. It was really only evident in the sacrifices, chase mechanics, some perks and the exit-gate, but not much anywhere else. Having the entire realm shake and burst at the seems to reveal the Entity's reign over the trials is a really neat thematic change I fully welcome. 
---
Cautiously optimistic of the end of trial changes, but the Killer being able to close the hatch still concerns me, particularly in 1 versus 1 scenarios. If two Exit Gates spawn fairly close to one another as they sometimes do, there'll be simply no way the Survivor can get out at all. If the Survivor arrives at an open hatch first with the Killer right behind them, the entire interaction is now entirely in the Killer's favor - the Survivor can't jump into it without risk of being grabbed, but the Killer can close the hatch right in-front of them, lose almost no ground on the Survivor, and guarantee a scenario where the Survivor absolutely has no chance to sneak away and open an exit-gate.
---
It's impossible to tell how exactly this will work and the entire dynamic that will evolve from these changes - but I honestly feel like this is giving too much security and advantage to the Killer, and not enough opportunity or hope to the Survivors.
---
Makes Small Game that much more useful.
---
"Even those hiding in lockers" Then of course it was a Dwight

Does her art need a lot of praise for her to enjoy it and keep doing it? Is she doing art for the wrong reason? Art is more about expression than people’s opinions, no? Her art is lovely. She sounds like she’s got the wrong motives. Art should be for her, for the soul - as dumb as that sounds.
---
So 3 perks now in the occasion you might get tunneled and slugged?
---
Not to mention the huge nerf DS got from enduring. It seems a little impractical.
---
The only thing that sucks is that if there are no gens repaired and only 1 survivor left they can still escape...
---
Its not the greatest TO ME. But its still pretty good. 
---
I have no talent so its all good lol.
---
Entity: Fine, I'll do it myself
---
Hatch spawns exactly as before, except itll spawn for the last guy no matter how many gens.
---
I am shaking and crying why is Michael here guys is this real omg
---
I didn't have to if less than 2 gens were done
---
I will never leave you. I am one with you.
---
u/peanits are any changes planned in regards to noed? It might become very powerful now.
---
You trollin’ tho right?
---
Why I have a feeling Pig traps may get a nerf cause of this.
---
Please stop, I can only get so erect.
---
Endgame collapse allows killers to trigger the endgame whenever they want to. If it looks like you might not get your NOED, trigger the collapse and it'll activate. This definitely works in favor of NOED.
---
When a survivor is hooked the timer slows dramatically to give survivors more time.
---
I’m just waiting for a David king tru3 cap accessory.
---
Thanks! I hate it. Why is this a thing, it only punishes survivor as if the game wasn’t already hard enough for my terrible ass. Is this a new game mode or a permanent change?
---
Bit confused how the new emblem system will play out if the killer starts the endgame ASAP and barely anyone has any points.
---
"Game time started"
---
This is a godsend. I’ve been in so many hatch standoff games where we are both stubbornly wasting time. This is a great addition.
---
If a play-style troubled me enough, I'd slot all 4 perks to deal with it. Problem solved.
---
why does the one in the bottom right look like Belle Delphine
---
If they even think about my OinkGoddess I will be sad.
---
I'm feeling a bit like if the killer manages to close the hatch on you, you're more or less hooped unless you have the key. Opening a full gate without them noticing is going to be very difficult.
---
As long as there's a NOED change I'm happy. I think BW is largely fine.
---
Keep in mind that it’s an ultra rare, and if Legion *does* end up being trash, then this add-on should help a lot. They have reworked his other add-ons as well.
---
My hope is it will allow the devs to help enforce a stronger disconnect policy in the future. Before all the killer could do to end the game within any time is DC. Now they can trigger the exit gate if they have to go or if they are being stomped. Thus allowing the devs to enforce a stronger penalty for disconnecting. My hope is that you receive 0 shards 0 bloodpoints for your next X games after a dc for the first couple offenses and more severe penalties on subsequent DCs (cooldowns, bans).
---
I don't chase them because then I give them what they want, I just wait I don't care if it takes 10 minutes.
---
Once every quarter of time.
---
If it would mean skins were 5-10 bucks, I’d pay 20 bucks for basic poe and 5 for an extension/dlc every 3 months, easily. 
---
How can you even compare this with a straight face. A game having a fairly small standard price doesn’t mean it’s skins have to be 10 times cheaper than a free2play game’s skins. 
---
As a customer, I’d take DbD’s model over PoE’s every day of the week
---
Ok well if it works for you and you have fun with it then keep it up!
---
So could you make a game 3 mins long by just immediatly starting endgame?
---
Downing survivors slows the end game down dramatically tho.
---
Idk like, kinda takes away the threat of being the killer when 3 survivors are hovering around the one other survivor you hooked. There's no pressure. This will actually make it so that survivors don't have a significant control over end game, and have something to be afraid of.
---
Fuck you urban evasion Claudettes!
---
technically thats intentionally disconnecting
---
This wouldn't change much if a Survivor is hooked. The timer is three minutes by default and it is slowed whenever someone is dying or hooked. Each hook stage is sixty seconds, so at most they would only be hooked for two minutes. Even before you take the slowed timer into consideration, that would still leave you with an extra minute to leave. The limiting factor here is still the time they can be on the hook, not so much the End Game timer.
---
Ohhhh buddy the fire on the ground is going to fuck the killer up trying to follow the scratch marks.
---
&gt;"but not when they are dehumanising, belittling and mocking other people, all while not bothering to realize they are being the very thing they are trying to make someone else out to be"  
---
So, you're shunning people for calling others out, and here you are, calling them out. That must mean you're exactly the same kind of person, right? See how stupid that sounds? Or is it, dare I say it, **not the same thing**?
---
not harsh at all, now survivors wont hold the game hostage, or when you get 3 people with 5 gens still up you wont need to look for some immersed survivor
---
Getting the most out of that stomp animation.
---
They said the are reworking certain end game perks. NOED will stay the same. It's safe to say perks like blood warden will probably be changed to prevent a scenario where everyone is forced to die. They'll probably slow down or stop the timer altogether when blood warden is active.
---
I believe it would be easier to get the theme from the most recent movie considering that’s what the chapter is mainly based on (when looking at tapps outfit)
---
Not even the official SAW games could get the license for “Hello Zep” so I’d be impressed if BHVR could have gotten it.
---
Yeah I feel like the basement is going to need to be adressed.
---
:(
---
Never wanted to taste blood more in my life
---
Call me a horrible person, but I'm really looking forward to that. From a Killer perspective, of course.
---
Technically, by waiting, you are giving them exactly what they want too. You are wasting your own time - that is their straight intent.
---
That’s pretty shitty, she should give up. *jk lol xd uwu*
---
I read M&amp;A’s...
---
Ignoring everyone else for one person, even when said other people are right in front of you, not giving the tunnelee the chance to escape.
---
We shall oink them together.
---
If it get abused so much it will be just another Legion case.
---
Guess it depends on the system you’re playing on. Almost every Wraith on PS4 camps.
---
But he isn’t what we asked for, that’s why people are freaking out. Yes there were many problems that needed to be addressed and damn if this need didn’t do that, but they didn’t even try to keep legion where he was in terms of strength or viability. 
---
They didn’t rework the character, they threw his ass in the trash and told us to shut up about him. That’s not very promising for future solutions to issues the game has or will have, especially since the legion was paid content for a lot of people.
---
You think they want you to hit them?
---
You know you get points for that right?
---
i think it happens after a certain number of survivors have been sacrificed
---
Once the killer closes the hatch the gates are powered, so you might have some wiggle room there.
---
But yeah, you are in a pretty bad spot when that happens. I feel like the killer shouldn't be able to grab the survivor out of the hatch to compensate for the fact that they can close it if they get to it first.
---
I'm willing to bet he's referring to things like Bitter Murmur.  If the Killer finds the hatch first and closes it, it will trigger the 10 second aura reveal for Bitter Murmur, which will basically give the survivor no chance.
---
Closing hatch powers doors (aka 5 gens done equivalent), they still need to open them to get out
---
Yeah, with collapse they might need to rebalance those perks. And as someone pointed out elsewhere in the thread, The Pig and her Reverse Bear traps are also getting buffed with this since survivors cant leave the exit gates with them on. Hopefully, they take the time to rebalance a lot of stuff around the collapse since I can see how this could be frustrating for survivors.
---
The gates will be powered (*not opened*) and the End Game Collapse will start. You then have three minutes to open a gate and leave.
---
I don't understand the point in allowing the gates to be opened by the killer with 4 survivors at full health and 4 gens still left to do.
---
Why would this ever be needed? Means killers can do some crazy as builds where they open gates at the start and force survivors to get basically no points and de pip?
---
Finally, the buff we have been waiting for
---
It powers the gates, it doesn't open them.
---
So Killer can close the hatch.  So no hatch sand off but they just stroll out the two now open gates?
---
Did you guys keep in mind some killers powers and perks can abuse this, since the killer can active the Collapse?
---
what this guy right here said
---
It’s balanced because:
---
A,) survivors failed the trial, escape isn’t something that should be guaranteed. You can still get the hatch, but the killer can close the hatch. THIS is balance, not a free escape the way it has been.
---
B.) the game automatically completes the remaining generators. You just need to power one of the two exit gates
---
And
---
C.) it eliminates hatch stand offs and ridiculously long end game while 1 survivor sneaks around 20 minutes
---
Entity kill counts as a sacrifice for killer.
---
I believe there was 1 survivor left which made the hatch appear. The killer closed the hatch and it started the endgame.
---
Myers stalked and ate the clown 😮
---
The pips he was giving up were because red ranked killers had like 30+min wait times
---
In the video all survivors are alive, 4 gens remaining and end game was triggered. Let me find time stamp.
---
Bodyblocking survivors in the basement has just become even more problematic. When will it finally be addressed?
---
While you can bodyblock a survivor in any corner and wait for the timer to run out, it's a pretty rare chance-occurrence. In the basement however, not only can you more reliably create situations in which you get to hold survivors prisoners, but you can do it to multiple survivors simultaneously, securing they all get swallowed by the Entity.
---
That's the biggest problem I see with the End Game Collapse, for now.
---
END GAME PIGGY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
So... If you have a key and the killer has closed the hatch, can you re-open it and escape?
---
It will screw over survivor BP boosters such as Escape! Cakes, how about that?
---
Its one thing when you piss off killers. Its another thing when you PISS OFF THEIR BOSS.
---
nah don't worry about it. Youre probably right. thats my b
---
All the LeatherFace and Legion mains are playing him now.
---
Aw upset you can't get free kills that the survivors can't counter? :( Cry more
---
It looks really similar to the Deathgarden one
---
The gens have to be powered to just open the exit gates as killer, right?
---
33 seconds in, all survivors alive, 4 gens remaining, end game triggered.
---
The killer can tap the door if they 99 it. Plus the real purpose of collapse is to finish games not kill survivors
---
What do you do if the killer block you in a corner or in the basement?
---
If there is a surv that gets saved in the basement and the killer blocks it thats an automatic 2 kills.
---
Or what if you get stuck in a corner by killer or god forbid a tree then there is also no chance to escape.
---
Maybe I'm just being a whiney survivor main :0
---
what do mean by 99% doors? to counter blood warden?
---
I'd wait to see if the perks get changed first:  [https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1118900948510871552](https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1118900948510871552)
---
*its
---
I don't care about them wasting my time, I just don't want them to T-bag in front of me.
---
Don't worry, we've kept that in mind. There could potentially be some changes coming to specific perks/powers.
---
It spawns as normal, except for when theres one guy left, then itll spawn no matter how many gens
---
 I really don't like this. It would be better and make more sense if the entity took both the killer and survivor for taking a long time so it encourages them both to move around the map and not just punish the survivor for understandably not running to a hatch that's being camped on when there's too many gens left to not get caught. Also giving the killer points for a timer running out like really? They could practically be doing nothing and get points. 3 minutes? wtf? Some of us actually enjoy long intense games -.-
---
Exit gates are powered and survivor can open to escape. 
---
Still feels like this favors the killer. A huge rework to nerf survivor meta because ppl tbag. Seems like overkill.
---
I mean leftbehind is used by no one it needs changing anyway
---
Calm down brother
---
I can’t respond to everyone in this comment thread. 
---
But the devs said something about changing some perks around for the collapse phase. 
---
There’s no way they wouldn’t change NoED to at least be made active only on after all gens are repaired rather than whenever the killer wants, right?
---
Not gonna lie, I'm liking what I see! Thanks for everyone's hard work. You guys really are committed to this game.
---
This update will change the very face of the game.
---
Gates duh
---
You could use it to force perks like blood warden
---
He's also wasting their time.
---
Oh wow I didn’t notice that part. I thought it was for the clip with 1 survivor left.
---
It’s been a little over 4 months since legion came out. I understand not impulse buying but there’s a difference between waiting a week or two to see if he gets changed, even a month for people who are really concerned, but I’d say at 4 months that advice is super pointless. 
---
No one is gonna wait unless the next killer comes out to buy the last one “in case they are shit or get changed.”
---
Is it *opening* or *powering* the gates? The video and voice-over give mixed information, would be nice to know which one is meant.
---
From what I picked up, it's probably only doable when either all gens are done, or 1 survivor is left.
---
When the killer closed the hatch, the game immediately says "FIND THE EXIT". The narrator doesn't say anything about it though.
---
A broken iredescent isnt uncommon in this gamd
---
If someone unhooks during blood warden, will the timer be paused or will it keep going?
---
I think it's safe to say that Pig and Freddy are getting indirect buffs from all of this. They can take their sweet time trapping/sleeping survivors while panic ensues lol
---
They have to open the gates still.
---
Which will almost never happen.
---
So if there's a hatch standoff, can killer just close the hatch and immediately start the chase with both gates still locked? If so, there's no way survivors escape.
---
So their only solution would be to sneak to the hatch without being noticedvor do gens? 
---
As a killer, I certainly like this scenario. Would save ton of time for everybody.
---
Logistically, it's going to be pretty hard to pull off consistently. Depends on the timer slow-down for dying/hooked survivors. 
---
But still, I guarantee within 48 hours of these changes on either the PTB or live, we'll have a clip of all 4 people dying in the blocked exit gate thanks to Bloodwarden, and it will be glorious.
---
It’s done intentionally, not a random bug. It’s possible to switch to killer and then join SWF.
---
Haha. See more disconnects coming
---
THE BOX YOU OPENED IT WE CAME
---
So exits are powered when the hatch closes? Why block the gens then? Shouldn’t they just all be done?
---
Don’t worry. The next update they’re gonna implement something where survivors can’t move and just constantly make noise so killer can 4K every time no problem.
---
Yes it's really weird, gonna need some extra explanation for that specific clip to fully understand if Killers can truly open the gate and start the end game whenever they want.
---
1. Nope. Timer starts when a door is opened or the hatch is closed, meaning they have no fixed time limit on finding the hatch.
---
2. You're trading the hatch standoff for immediately powering the doors. This better, but not great, mainly because of the overly-generous time limit. The simple fix to hatch standoffs was: make jumping through the hatch take slightly longer than it does for the Killer to wipe their weapon. As for the Survivors hanging around too long? After x amount of time, their aura is revealed to the Killer, even inside lockers.
---
3. Agreed.
---
\*Insert scottish woman screaming DISGUSTANG\*
---
Fastest disconnect in the west
---
Forget about the gens it’s the end game they don’t matter anymore
---
Sounds like it powers up the gates, allowing survivors to open them.
---
Nowhere did it say if you close the hatch the exit gates automatically open. The collapse starts if you close the hatch or if you or a survivor open an exit gate. That’s all they said. So you can kick the hatch closed and then freely patrol both gates as that’s the only way they’ll have to escape (assuming keys don’t work on a hatch you’ve closed).
---
The gens still have to be completed before they can open the gate
---
This confused me too but you can see it in the video that when the killer closes the hatch, the exit gates become powered.
---
Damn bro you got the shotgun cosmetic for billy?
---
As hilarious as this could be with certain builds, I don't think the gates can be opened until they've actually been powered, either through repairing the required amount of generators or by the Killer closing the hatch.
---
Whats that, Whispers 4 ?
---
I wanna ask, how does the game run on switch?
---
Permanent change and you’re right. Everything lately seems to be nerfing survivor meta. And for solo players this sucks.
---
how old is your friend? this is what my art used to look like when i was in middle school/ early high school and now i’m 20 and my art has greatly improved. either way i’m still impressed by your friend please tell them that!
---
This is actually unnerving. It actually restores the horror aspect of the game by putting the survivors in much dire situations regarding altruism and self-preservation; they can either take the risk and sacrifice themselves to save someone, or GTFO.  However, endgame killers/builds are probably living.
---
However, this is basically the Entity grabbing their Infinity Gauntlet and saying, "Fine, I'll do it myself."
---
You're misunderstanding, the killer, like survivors can open the gate after gens are done to start the collapse.
---
Yep, much stronger position for the killer. Survivor has to go do gets as before.
---
I watched the video a couple times and am sure they say once the gates are powered either the survivor or killer can open the gate. So the match can’t just start and killer can open the gate, 5 gens still gotta get done or if someone opens the hatch and then once the killer closes the hatch the gates power..l think. Then with the final survivor the hatch can’t be closed but assuming the endgame will still be going so no hatch standoffs I’m guessing.
---
How is he gonna get the perk then, if he doesn't even own the Killer?
---
I heard it just fine, i was talking about seeing it. thank you tho. the only thing you see is the gates powering up when the hatch closes.
---
and if we take everything from this video as gospel, then the killer can open the gate at any point now (36 second mark - 4 gens, 4 survivors remaining)
---
You could always be a little cautious and cleanse totems ahead of time, but worst case scenario the timer is slowed once someone is downed or hooked. The End Game Collapse only starts once a gate is opened as well, so the time between the generators being completed and opening a gate is also an option. You should still have plenty of time to deal with it.
---
Giving up is a hundred% guarantee to never be good.
---
also keep in mind that when in the Terror Radius your Deep Wound timer doesn't go down. So literally if Legion uses this and stays in feral frenzy, no matter how far they run from you, you don't need to mend.
---
Well in the video it mentions all gens get disabled so that would mean they normally still can be done. That's why I thought maybe you could start endgame sooner.
---
keep the doors at 99% for a minute, blood warden duration ends if activated. That’s what I’m guessing is meant
---
She is 15
---
It’s tunneling if the killer is intentionally singling out one person. It’s not tunneling if you got downed again because of bad plays. I would say most players think the latter and that’s just not accurate and encourages bad plays.
---
It’s that simple.
---
So I can close the hatch and force the survivor stay in the tier 3 madness as doc so they can't open the gate and I can just watch the show? Now that's interesting.
---
big fart shit pants
---
Nervously hee hees
---
Just making sure there was still a way to get out...
---
The video didn't say this explicitly (I think) but you can see the bubble of the exit gate powering up after the killer closed the hatch
---
I'm curious if this counts for when a survivor opens the hatch with the key and there are still gens left.. are the other survivors just fucked?
---
ikr, pigs are always the sweatiest
---
&gt;The only thing that sucks is that killers will rely even more on endgame builds/perks like NOED, Blood Warden
---
Honestly, it will be fun to see more variety in perks. Bloodwarden isn't used much and this might help it. I just don't want the same perks every game.
---
It would prob be really unbalanced I just wanted to speed through games by starting endgame as soon as everyone gets in.
---
Isn't the trollface copyrighted by the original artist? I remember hearing something about them going after people who use it in a commercial product but don't care about people just making memes and shit with it.
---
Yeah this was my first thought. I'm worried it will be so bad I have to quit playing again.
---
Seems more like a random design choice than having any actual gameplay value.
---
Slug who exactly? The hatch will open no matter how many gens are completed if their is only 1 survivor left. You’re going to slug the last survivor and take a peek at the scenery?
---
Yeah this endgame collapse is amazing IMO. Maybe now my fellow survivors will just leave when they have the chance.
---
I mean, theres still crows. And now with the new endgame you can close the hatch and force them to move
---
In the video there was 4 gens not done and the Collaps started. Check 0:36.
---
Looks like they're another console player who doesn't understand the logistics of the PTB and how it could never work on their platform.
---
It starts the collapse time, if I understand correctly.
---
this is... blood. likely your own blood, as well as the killer's blood. this is blood.
---
Or two survivors fighting over who gets the hatch
---
That I do agree with. I've tried body blocking before and even if I make it to where they can't vault a window or go through a pallet area they will go around just to reach the unhooked person. That's pretty awful for the other person.
---
The best thing the unhooked person can do is loop as long as possible and hope their teammates can progress while you distract the killer.
---
Again.
---
Wow I couldn't imagine wasting 10 minutes of my time just because I'm so deeply affected by tbagging.
---
It's petty on both parts but you can easily chase them out if not for your e-pride .
---
Umm git gud? I see plenty of people dominate with camperface..
---
The original Andy when he dropped out of college
---
**laughs in blood warden**
---
I just watched Paulie Esther's short stream and he brought up a good question. What will happen if the killer hooks a survivor in the basement and then simply decides to block the stairs, preventing survivors from leaving the basement?
---
Interesting. Thanks for hard work! Looking forward to it and waiting for the 2vs8 mode ; )
---
Id like to see this with Unnerving Presence. Must be fun
---
It does. Thanks!
---
Literally everyone would disconnect.
---
Tf is a linkage
---
Is opening the gate an immediate action for the killer like closing the hatch?
---
The video shows it being opened with 4 gens left and 4 survivors left.
---
It doesn't stop though, just slows down
---
This has me worried too. If a nurse is destroying your team with you as the last one standing, closes the hatch, and both exit gates spawn within 40 yards of each other - there is absolutely ***ZERO*** chance you're getting out alive. If the nurse notices one gate has more progress than the other, she's just going to blink over there and search until she finds you - even discounting that, she just has to keep both exit switches in view, and wait you out for 3 minutes for the collapse, and then boom she wins because of map RNG. There's literally no fucking way to get out.
---
The whole point of the hatch is that it offers an alternative escape. This looks set to just rob a last surviving survivors of any chance of actually making it out without a miracle of factors. So they've basically turned the end-game into the thing they swore they never would: it's a free extra kill for Killers, and an impossible situation for survivors to succeed. 
---
I hope everyone likes lengthy Killer queues and only facing SWFs - because I can state with 100% clarity that fewer people than ever before will be playing survivor with this shit.
---
Blood Warden persists if they get unhooked.
---
It's simply if you hook someone while a gate is open, the entity closes the exit for however long your Bloodwarden is one time.
---
Perhaps the preview would be blurred, in order to remove blur you must buy.
---
that’s awesome for 15. the biggest thing about art is to keep practicing. i always found my biggest periods of improvement were when i got really into something new (a show, band, book) and would draw it nonstop. it’s easy to lose your ability to draw if you stop for a long time so she just has to stick with it
---
Linkage means you're allowed to post links in the chat
---
1 i dont think thats true
---
2 when the killer closes the hatch the exit gates are automatically powered
---
I feel like the survivor just might camp one of the doors until the killer finds the hatch,and open it as soon as the hatch closes.
---
Just because people succeed with the killer at times doesnt mean they're good. I dominate with Freddy, in fact I dominate way more often with freddy than I do hillbilly and nurse, must mean he's op. /s
---
He could buy it.
---
Leatherface is the cheapest one, and most people I imagine didn’t pay full price for this game.
---
Killers aren’t $20 they are $8-$5 if people can’t buy the ones they want I don’t pity them they are probably children..
---
But if killer opens the gate, then the survivors can easily escape, or at the very best only 1 suvivors gets downed, while the rest of them run away as the killer is distracted on one.
---
its going to be amazing.
---
stoked that the killers can now force people into the collapse by opening the exit gate.
---
Yeah the main point is not to just give her the power over and over again. Often times I get into games with survivors who will get puked on and go to the fountain and use it right away and do it every time they do. As long as you show some restraint with your fountain usage so that she cant constantly have her purge up youre good. Obviously depending on how the killer plays this means in some games it's reasonable to use the fountain more than in others.
---
The artist of the original trollface would never go after BHVR over this because the artist would most definitely loose if BHVR decided to go to court because what BHVR did to the original trollface is considered transformative art.
---
1. I imagine it’ll have its own animation or might be an instant thing.  
---
2. As soon as the killer closes the hatch, the gates are powered and can be opened.
---
But you have Tombstone and Tuft of hair
---
They have 3 minutes to walk 10m, once the exit gates are open. Wow.
---
Think on this; why even go for the hatch? Just stand by a door, wait for the Killer to close the hatch and open the door before they can get there.
---
Others already did.
---
If only you could spam it like the mori. We can dream.
---
This is a thing to prevent people from holding a game hostage. Its going to the public test realm next week so we won't know until the testing is finished. Provide good feedback by playing it.
---
Just seeing the gate open by nothing because you're awake.
---
In the video there are 4 gens left when the endgame suddenly starts at about 36 seconds in.
---
"try their best"
---
Motherfucker have you played the game recently? It's currently nearing the worst state it's ever been in since launch. BHVR doesn't give a fuck.
---
I’m 90% sure it wasn’t trappers mask till recently... or am I trippin?
---
Gonna need a time machine to answer this one.
---
If a killer closes the hatch it powers the exit gates so the last survivor still has a shot
---
You will force the timer to start, be able to utilize blood warden effectively, etc. It's gonna most likely be situational but there will be plenty reasons to do it.
---
1 &gt; More than likely they'll just use their M1 animation  to "attack" the gate switch to activate it, maybe with a slight channel time to prevent accidental openings.  Kind of like during the last lunar event the way killers interacted with the lanterns was to swipe at them and destroy them.
---
2 &gt; Gens are locked off when the End Game Collapse starts. Gates also become powered at this point. So if the killer closes the hatch you still have the option of opening one of the two gates.
---
Thanks
---
You’re fucking blind and dumb if you think legion is not the worst killer now. The deep wound nerfs have made deep wound affect USELESS. Legion is now a boring standard killer with nothing to help him in chase. Okay he gets a slightly easier than normal hit at the start, but then what? Hitting survivors with deep wounds again does NOTHING now. There’s no benefit to playing this killer, he’s a waste of space
---
You’re not wrong, but not everyone plays SWF nor has ways to communicate with their teammates.
---
Since opening a door starts Collapse, then 99% it until everyone can escape is safer than just opening it and having to risk saving someone while the timer is ticking down.
---
Yeah which will allow both parties to finish a game instead of dragging it out farming points
---
Me too bud! Am glad others see the potential.
---
I'm wondering if the visual timer would just get trolls waiting to leave till the last second?
---
What if the game didn't show how much time you had left?
---
Not like there's much you can do when piggy tunnels your trapped butt even now.
---
Yeah, I didn't recognised the 2nd point while watching the video. Thanks for the advice
---
Okay.
---
Yes but now he’s probably the most useless (after Freddy update) killer now, I’m a legion main (oh nuuuu.... *sarcasm*) and I’m completely fine with a rework or nerf, or what ever but it’s just too much now, he was at least decent to play as before, but now again, he’s dead
---
Hmmmm
---
With the way they’ve been nerfing survivors lately would you be surprised?
---
All according to plan
---
I'm talking about countering the hatch. If they are outside of quick slash range, you can't stop them jumping in.
---
They haven't fixed this biggest problem with the hatch.
---
Which it honestly needed.
---
You lived to see the age of NOED and hatch stand off bullshit come to an end.
---
Thank you jesus.
---
Yeah but using the fountains too much can still fuck over your team. Stealth isn't reliable, between tracking perks, logic, plain luck, and gen patrolling you're bound to find someone regardless of how stealthy they're being and if you go crouching in a corner instead of working on gens when she goes corrupt you're allowing her to pressure you into not doing gens.
---
N o dont dew it
---
Oh sorry, I though it was already out for Switch. My bad.
---
This is the only mp game I play that uses PtB’s and it still somehow has more bugs than the other games I play so I’d rather just not have them lol
---
I think you mean 10 times lmao
---
Real talk tho, do you guys realize they made killers like pig and Freddy with remember me even more powerful at the endgame, honestly I'm hyped.
---
So this is just a massive survivor nerfs but no nerfa to killers? Amazin
---
Oh stop. 
---
They’ve been balancing the game for the better.
---
Okay, that sounds logically. Thanks
---
buying the item in-game also gave you model files for use in blender and SFM.
---
dont like the map as killer? instead of DC'ing, just open the gate
---
You've debunked all his half-constructed arguments with well thought out rebuttals, so now he's resulted to anecdotal evidence that bears no weight and stopped responding.
---
People like this is why this community is incapable of discussion. They don't want a discussion - they just want to be right regardless of reality.
---
They didn’t really specify if when it’s final survivor if the hatch can be closed. But the way it’s all worded it sounds like the hatch can always be closed. I thought at first when it was the final survivor the hatch would open and Endgame would begin then you got 3 minutes to find the hatch before the killer. Then if there is a stand-off well it’ll end once the endgame timer from niches so no standoffs, but some of it needs a little more explanation which I’m sure will happen in the coming weeks.
---
Those are pretty legit concerns. Also, if the killer opens one gate, will the other one also open or will the survivors need to open it? I think it'll be cool for trap killers, like the trapper and hag, if the other gate doesn't open.
---
"No matter how many gernernernators have been repaired."
---
I was thinking about making one that was less susceptible to breaking tlbut then I thought I might as well buy a real beartrap at that point haha but I'm not sure if I'll paint it yet
---
All my huntress mains know that’s a phat f in that chat when you see those🤣
---
Oh well?  If the killer did well I don't see why the hatch situation needs to be in favor of the survivor.
---
Well don't take it personally, it needed to happen. It will be easier to build him up rather than skin him down.
---
I mean we already get punished for the killer quitting right away, no reason to think they are going to think through how to fix it when someone rushes the end game.
---
Endgame is honestly better for survivors. I usually leave by 3 minutes of the doors being powered. Also the hatch opens when there is one survivor left regardless of gen progress which is a major help to my immersive playstyle
---
Thanks for the encouragement. Apologies if I came off as curt or salty, it's just that I get testy when people use these buzzwords like "tunneling," "camping," "genrushing," "unfun," etc.
---
But yeah, if a survivor gets focused hard right off the hook every time and they don't have the perks/skill/knowledge to deal with it, then I understand it can get frustrating really fast. Likewise, green killers can get wrung out by a super efficient survivor team, and it can feel like a futile exercise in frustration if he/she lacks the tools to deal with it. The advice I'd give is to keep grinding, get better perks, learn the ins and outs of the game the hard way, and don't make excuses for a loss, regardless of how cheesy or unfair it may seem at first.
---
To address the opening post: A killer aiming to win as efficiently as possible might decide to focus on the weak link to quickly turn a 1v4 into a 1v3. The survivors are responsible for implementing proper counter-play to that in any way they can. It's no different than when survivors go especially hard on generators and the killer has to counter-play that with their perks/skills. Whether something is "toxic" or not isn't a concern to me, because if I want to get better at the game, I am ultimately responsible for my win or my loss. Any other outlook takes that control away from me, and I will never get improve.
---
I hope that gives a bit of insight into my outlook on the matter. Good luck in the fog!
---
Ill just 100 % and leave if its pig ... end of story
---
\^ that
---
Yup, blatant repost.
---
Last patch got a huge fix update on the PTB before it went to live. A.k.a. it would've been way worse.
---
Nothing has changed about NOED?
---
There’s a big difference between powering the gates and opening them. With gates often spawning on the same wall of the map and high mobility killers like billy, hag, spirit, nurse etc. it’s basically GG if the killer finds hatch first and you’re the only one left. 
---
At least based on this very short promo video. I’m sure there are tons of details we’re not aware of yet.
---
He did play horribly but you can’t look at that and say that those perks are fair. Killers get no EASY second chances like that. Survivors have easy no brained second chances that have 0 counter play. Kettle of man is fucking broken
---
I can see people abusing the hatch mechanic. Let's say the killer finds the hatch first, they can just stand on it until they see a survivor, then close it in their face and they essentially cannot lose, because they won't give the survivor a chance to open the gates.
---
The only way the survivor can win the encounter is if they find the hatch first, or the find the killer standing on the hatch, goes and does generators instead, baits the killer out and bum rushes back to the hatch in hopes the killer doesn't catch them mid animation.
---
Wew, imagine being an asshole like you that trash talks people avoiding situations that make them upset so they can enjoy their video game more.
---
Okay, I forgot about the blocked gens at this point of the game. Thanks for the hint
---
To force the timer to begin, if survivors are being idiots and running around and not opening. It could massively help a killer if the two entrances are rather close together and he's camping them. No one can get to one, but he opens one, and can still watch the other, while forcing the survivors to either get by him, or try to open the nearby gate.
---
It's still ticking however. It's not that much slower as far as we know.
---
If they didn’t give a fuck they wouldn’t listen to the fucking player base when they ask for things like dedicated servers or killer/perk reworks. If they didn’t give a fuck they wouldn’t come out with new DLC every few months
---
Why would there be a NOED change? NOED already encourages survivors to get out ASAP. The fact that downing a player stops the timer is only to the survivors’ benefit.
---
From what I can tell, both gates have to be opened by either a survivor or a killer so I don't think they both open. 
---
Yeah as trapper can dely them going through with the right add ons or the hag can slow down people without UE or flashlights.
---
Finally those guys get some semi buffs!
---
Remember me will only slow down the gate timer. so since the endgame happens after 1 gate is opened the timer isnt up for the first gate. second the timer goes slower while someone is downed and on hook so by that the timer will go slower during blood warden. Pig yeah but she can slow the game down at any point. so it doesnt seem that big to me
---
What about killers who refuse to close the hatch for the sake of stand offs just to be annoying? Might as well remove hatch grabs bc these people will be annoying
---
Freddy getting remake....
---
Yes. It's a risky play and chances are it won't be beneficial to the Killer, but it will force out any Survivors who refuse to leave and instead stick around to waste the Killer's time.
---
All I heard was "you get to become us, and thank you for the 'tunity"
---
Yea I don't think its supposed to be something the killer does often, its just for the rare scenario where you want to get the game done and the survivors are stalling.
---
Highest effort meme I ever saw on this sub, see you on the front page!
---
Doesn't stop mid-chase escapes, is what I should have said.
---
Also, good luck seeing scratchmarks with all that red on the ground.
---
Wait.. so endgame collapse can happen if there is one survivor remaining regardless of generators.. so there can be 5 gens remaining, killer can close the hatch and collapse starts.. but at that point the last survivor has no ability to do generators meaning they cant progress and open the hatch or the gate.. the fuck?
---
I wonder if you can reopen hatch with a key after killer shuts it
---
I love the idea because i have came across people refuse to leave when i have a bad killer. but killers also have a lot toxic killers which is why i am not happy for this.
---
Please factor in Left Behind (Bill perk) in this review. It's currently borderline useless and now will be even more so.
---
Yeah I was puzzled by that. I guess it takes away the main effect of his power completely in exchange for using it to always find survivor locations. You could also combine it with unnerving presence.
---
Btw, my autocorrect tried to change "power" to "pussy" in my first draft. I giggled.
---
Im a p3 nea main and i never DC because regardless of everything i need the bloodpoints
---
"Buchi'"?
---
Not really.
---
The big issue is the time limit being pretty damn generous.
---
Blood Warden should be reviewed, seeing as the killer can force activation of this now (opening the gates themselves) and guarantee a 3rd of the timer to go down if they hook someone. Not to mention all the other end game perks both killer and survivor ones.
---
Right, his post doesnt fit the title.
---
Because the supposed 'counterplay' to NOED, i.e. cleansing the totem, becomes pretty much impossible during the collapse. The collapse seems to pretty much replace NOEdD's purpose, which is forcing the survivors to leave after a certain time. Coupling NOED with the collapse leaves close to no room for counterplay or any end game at all.
---
It still has the heartbeat location effect though. Could be useful with this add on.
---
This 100% summarizes my assessment based on the promo video. But we’ll see once people play it.
---
His comment really flew over your head huh
---
Yuuuuup.
---
All they had to was make it so jumping through the hatch takes longer than it does for the Killer to wipe their weapon.
---
I mean, the endgame collapse only happens if you open a gate or the killer closes the hatch, right? So as long as there's more than one of you left, killer can't close the hatch, and you're only on a timer if you've opened a gate.
---
I also think that they will give us some more information during the next weeks.
---
And I like the idea that the endgame will start automatically when three of the survivors died.
---
We will see how it works
---
Your mend meter doesn't go down in the terror radius
---
Would you rather there be no time limit?
---
it will encourage fuck your teammates  and GTFO
---
Imagine killer pulling a basement build and end game in effect blocking the basement, leave  or your dead when the timer runs out
---
I’ve never thought of this but you’re totally right.
---
Wdym by “holding a game hostage?” No animosity or anything, I’m genuinely interested idk what it means.
---
Ah I see
---
They should probably buff left behind for gens and exit gates (iirc then it’s just gens rn)
---
Killer will be able to open the gates like a Survivor, probably to help start the Collapse.
---
The Killer can still close hatch when only one guy is left, but it will automatically power up the gates.
---
Muh f i n g e r g u n s
---
I never said to nerf the fuck outa him.. but any nerf was in the best interest in the game as a whole. I just explained why it was neccessary. Vent your anger somewhere else.
---
I think this is an incredibly cool change. The only thing that I worry about is when the killer manages to close the hatch on you.
---
As a solo survivor, getting away with the 30 seconds of gate opening without them noticing you is going to be \*HARD.\* Literally all they have to do at that point is patrol the gates.
---
It might be more interesting if opening one gate would establish progress on both gates.
---
Regular cool down would promote garbage players still tbh
---
Wonder if the killer can still grab hatch jumps now that the killer can close the hatch. 
---
I think it'd be fair if a survivor can't be grabbed during the jump since the killer has the advantage in finding the hatch the survivor will win that "draw" where they both find it at the same time.
---
&gt;Play pig
---
&gt;Put RBT on every survivor
---
&gt;Activate end-game phase by closing
---
&gt;Patrol jigsaw traps
---
&gt;Kill all survivors
---
Am i getting this right?
---
All gens are powered when hatch is closed so you can get an exit gate
---
Never play by your enemy's rules.
---
i dont really understand the point of this other than to force survivors to leave once they have opened the exit gate. 
---
opening the gate as killer seems to give no advantage, and as a survivor i just leave the second i open the gate anyway so wont affect my gameplay
---
Omg I forgot about the basement lol your right on that 🤣🤣
---
Instant power on for gates if hatch is closed.
---
Havent seen anything yet about the endgame collapse or other killer changes aside from legion but bloodwarden has always been strong as hell on endgame trap piggy
---
I'm thinking more of Left Behind, which only activates when you're the last Survivor and boosts gen repair speeds. It's completely worthless with EGC as gens are blocked and the hatch spawns instantly as soon as 1 person is left.
---
Trying to camp 2 doors is better than a hatch standoff. Survivors can now get hatch when no gens are done. Seems fair to me.
---
Neat concept that they probably should have saved for the sequel game.
---
Can the key reopen the hatch?
---
Left Behind is pretty much guaranteed to be getting a rework now.
---
I’m 70% confident they threw the Dwight in a locker joke in there on purpose
---
Why would they even have to mention it? They say any survivor left behind will die, and then show Claudette get brutally Mori’d... but they have to specify “even those hiding in lockers” ? Seems suspicious specific and unnnecessary to mention that
---
Detlift Shrimpf
---
The three minute timer starts. So the survivors either die or are forced to leave the map.
---
Opening

---
thats in the case of the collapse starting as a result of the hatch being closed
---
I pretty much have everything for that laying around, even the yellow apron, I'd just need a mask
---
Do what you gotta do.
---
If you don't think standoffs are the biggest issue then I don't know what to tell you...
---
He replied to a tweet asking about what happens to Left Behind with the End Game Collapse, so I'm positive it got a rework. :)
---
I know this community throws these words around like nothing. That's why I was hoping this minor post would help clarify some stuff. Nbd, I know you weren't being mean or salty.
---
Learning the game is important regardless of a tunneling killer so that's some good advice in general. Plus with the ranking system still a semi issue, a survivor who isn't too great at the game yet are an easy target for an average killer (swf don't help at times)
---
That's why I refrain from getting too angry at the killer. They aren't obligated to give you fun, they are there to kill. Survivors are the same, do gens. While I think tunneling and camping do not improve skill, it is sometimes a must in certain situations (if I die to a camp at the end then sometimes there is nothing you can do)
---
Overall I do agree with a lot of your point of view, and until they so something about camping (I don't think they can or even should fix tunneling) then it's just take it.
---
But you too as well my friend!
---
yeah but terror radius perks will be supreme
---
And keys won't be nigh useless after the hatch has spawned for that one sole survivor who happens to have one.
---
... then don't start the collapse as a killer. If the survivor is camping the door then that is one less doing gens. Thus giving the killer an easier game.
---
Should killer really have the kills from this count as sacrifices? They didn’t really have to do anything to get those kills. I get wanting to sowed the end game up but why should killer get more points for something they seemingly will have to do very little for?
---
People don’t give a shit about teammates in pubs anyway. This changes nothing. You’re lucky to get one survivor on your team that’s not a selfish rat.
---
This means that every match is now a hatch game and every 4k relied on the killer being lucky enough to find hatch before survivor if the killer doesn't slug the second to last survivor.
---
You can't stop a survivor from finding hatch by killing everyone before 2 gens are done.
---
I'd rather a shorter time limit or have the doors take longer/require 20 *continuous*, not *cumulative*, seconds to open.
---
LMAO.
---
Calling an automatic hatch spawn at 5 gens "massive Survivor nerfs." This sub, I swear. 🤦‍♂️
---
We can finally escape from the killers!
---
No.
---
No, it isn’t. If all they fixed were the exploits or the really bad things, the only change would’ve been the no tick in terror radius and they would’ve changed franks mixtape. 
---
Those were actually changes to his kit. Everything else was a shit value adjustment that nerfed him or a straight up deletion of his power, the only two that “helped” being a slight increase to duration and base movement speed. 
---
Some things needed to be fixed, but instead of implementing good changes alongside the bad ones, they nerfed him hard even after they fixed the exploits. His power now lets him be just every other first hit killer, and even his first hit is still close to stock killers with the exception of being able to vault pallets.
---
Deleting a massive portion of a killers kit in exchange for a bit of movement speed isn’t a rework, it’s a massive nerf and quite embarrassing considering it took the devs 4 months to come up with this.
---
So even if I kill 3 survivors and they don’t finish any gems, I still have to worry about the hatch? Even if I get there first and close it, I still have to patrol 2 exit gates, which could be difficult with a big map and slow killer
---
They are, but there others to consider.
---
Yeah how dare they get rid of my favorite crutch perk
---
This means that keys will have even more value in endgame now. Thank you!
---
Bro when tf do 3 survivors die with 5 gens up dunno what plastic rank you are in but I have never seen that happen in 200hours
---
Unless I'm missing something, this 3 minute timer isn't gonna have a big effect on like 90% of the games unless they also make exit gates take longer to open.
---
Scenario 1: 5 gens are done and survivors open the gate; survivors just have to get out of the game in 3 minutes (longer if there's someone hooked), almost never a problem
---
Scenario 2: gens not done, last survivor left, killer closes the hatch; the survivor has 3 minutes to open a gate, and i don't think the time is ever gonna be the problem for him. In three minutes he's either dead cause he got caught our escaped through the gate; either way 3 minutes is plenty of time to do either.
---
I don’t like the hatch spawning regardless. Gives people a reason to not save me if we’re the only two left
---
I hate mettle of man
---
I’ll bite. What was wrong before that is more balanced now that isn’t directly in the killer’s favor?
---
Hatch won't be open to close at that point. Will have to open the gates, but yes.
---
I don’t use any perks or add-ons when playing killer at lower ranks because they are DUMB easy. You really don’t have to try at all.
---
Billys gonna be god of endgame. close the hatch and zip back and forth to gates until he find the survivor or timer runs out. Guaranteed 4k if he gets 3k
---
I like the idea of the powered gates when the killer closes the hatch.
---
I'm curious about how it looks when killers are open the gates. It could be funny and interesting I guess. Maybe they thought about some cool animations.
---
This would punish the killer as well. Immediately starting the end game would give the killer no emblem in stopping gens and would basically guarantee no/low emblems in everything else.
---
When will this  be implemented?
---
Let’s not pretend like slugging at end game isn’t already a thing.
---
Good. Those of you with that kind of integrity can stay in the mid-lower ranks and get t-bagged by survivors who you've spared.
---
Those of us who are red ranks and understand that it's a 4v1 game with the other side having several advantages over us will continue to hook and kill as possible to ensure a snowball effect. We also understand that 3v1 is much better so if you're injured and have been hooked before you are prime target #1.
---
He didn't stand in front of her and camp, he left then came back and searched for her and found her. That's what he was suppose to do. And mori's are a part of the game which she was at the mercy of. He derives his fun from killing her as do most killers otherwise we'd be playing as survivor; her idea of fun was something else. He shouldn't put his fun at risk to better hers. 
---
What she calls tunneling is nothing more than kill-rushing and there is nothing wrong with it. Gen rushing and kill rushing is not against the rules at all.
---
I especially love it how Survivors are killed by what looks like an Entity's middle finger.
---
It's a YouTube video called Michael Myers during October where he gets bullied by Fortnite kids.
---
I'm gunna
---
&gt; Calling an automatic hatch spawn at 5 gens
---
That's not true?
---
In my knowledge of how it's usually done, there's a scenario for voiceover and a scenario for video, and those most likely are done by different people and then glued together by another different person. It's probably just a wrong clip chosen for specifically that part of a video
---
When you forced your disgusting legiondick down our throats for 4 months and then go pikachuface "toxic?" stfu.
---
Then don't close the hatch
---
Isn't dbd team and bhvr completely two different teams?
---
Right, but if he hits someone, it shows the location of everyone in the entire level.
---
Not really. In his current state Freddy struggles against even mildly coordinated survivors and relys on people not getting skill checks. Even with yellow dress you still have a pretty reasonable chance to get a skillcheck. (Assuming that considerably means a 3% decrease in skill check chances you have a 5% chance for gens and 7.5% chance for self care.) Even then you still have moments where you are unable to do anything to stop survivors when they are completing actions that are very important. Doing a gen, opening a gate, doing a heal, saboing hooks, cleansing a totem, and exiting out a hatch. Something that every other killer can stop but Freddy cannot unless the person is already in dream state. 
---
While I understand how a total rework seems a little overkill, as simply making it so survivors would have 100% action speed penalty when falling into dream, making his power range a bit longer, and/or shortening his dream transition would work just fine I look forward to seeing what he is reworked into. 
---
TLDR: Freddy suffers from lack of reactionary ability, ease to escape from dream, and being a M1 killer at the core. While the aura reading, being unable to bodyblock/flashlight save, and the invis and smaller terror radius is nice his downsides are pretty damming.
---
Do you think it's fair to have to spend 2 perks to slightly combat what takes survivors 0 perks to do?
---
The only reason is because noed and hit boxes are a more pressing matter at the moment
---
You really think he can get around the map quick enough to make it worth it?
---
ruin and noed both been buffed in favor of killers.
---
How on earth does Spirit Fury reward the killer for not playing well?
---
These changes to end game really are ” a pretty good job so far!”
---
I agree.
---
just wait for rank reset. ezpz
---
achievements require more luck than skill most of the time.
---
&gt;not using the word thot in the right context
---
I think he is. I think I heard him hum *Hava Nagila* one or twice in his streams.
---
Bloodwarden is probably gonna block the gates until the survivor is rescue, which could go up to 2 minutes
---
rip
---
It's probably only during frenzy or something like that.
---
Emblem system is gonna be a mess.
---
Came here to ask this. Thanks bro
---
As someone who mostly plays survivor, this looks fun as heck. I'm psyched.
---
NANI ??!!?
---
I saw it happen frequently, irregardless of rank. Nurse on The Game. Distressing/Unnerving Presence Doc on The Game. Mint Rag Hag on nearly any map. Billy on Rotten Fields. Infinite T3 Myers with a couple of blind Survivors. You see all kinds of shit when you don't DC when things go south.
---
First: That's not pikachu face, that's air quotes "toxic". 
---
Second: who pissed in your cornflakes
---
Third: who pissed in your lucky charms.
---
Without even thinking, Exhaustion.
---
this is how blood warden becomes meta
---
You know, you can counter spirit fury by dropping pallets a little bit early.
---
Survivors have three minutes to escape, more if someone goes down. I’ve had NOED go down in about 30 seconds. And it still only takes 20 seconds to open a door. What more counter play do you want?
---
If they refuse to close the hatch, the survivor can leave and do gens. This forces the killer to either close hatch or leave with it open.
---
If the survivors don’t leave for three minutes, that’s literally their fault. Like I don’t see what killer could stall all four survivors for three minutes once the gates are powered and truthfully if you meander around with two gates and a hatch, you deserve to get killed for negligence.
---
Doesnt mean we cant slug
---
Or the two gates could be right next to each other and then the survivor is screwed.
---
This is going to be extremely abused, I’m calling it.
---
It’s harsh in the sense that it’s now incredibly unlikely you will ever get a teammate who’s been hooked out. Specifically if it’s down near the halfway point or further in the endgame timer. Camping kinda got buffed actually.
---
Imagine camping the hatch as wraith, uncloaking when they find it and starting the endgame collapse. The biggest "oh shit" moment in the game.
---
I must be the only one that stays at the exit gate to give the killer some free extra points. Especially if the game was fun and intense. I guess trying to be a good sport is rare in this game.
---
Awesomeness
---
no no no, THIS is me :)
---
It’ll stop t bag at exit gates or people meandering to wait for the killer to look at them leave.
---
I hope it's identical to the survivor animation. Just picturing trapper in that pose makes me laugh.
---
Are slugged players immediately killed by the endgame collapse as well? Sounds like it would buff slugging a tad if so
---
Then you run to the gates and leave?
---
Agreed. It brings back that survival horror feel that the game has been missing for a while. I would love to see more features like this in the future. Make Dead By Daylight actually Dead By Daylight and not "Looping/T bag simulator"!
---
Well they still can, just now theres a 3 minute time limit.
---
Maybe a survivor is glitched somewhere as well
---
I always see the Hex:Ruin perk as a troll face
---
what? spirit fury does not reward a killer for doing bad. the only perk that really does that in my opinion is NOED just like how the old DS was
---
the only major one will be unnerving presence, and I guess you can count overwhelming presence..as underwhelming as that perk actually is, and coulrophobia.
---
Of those 3 only unnerving seems decent, especially since coulrophobia won't affect mending.
---
Waiting for 3 minutes is still better than say waiting for 10.
---
The entity kill looks brutal.
---
Some people have the mentality of not wanting to pay money for stuff they could get for free though, gotta also take into account if OP even cares about cosmetics in the first place, as they don't really improve gameplay.
---
[THE KILLER CAN CLOSE THE HATCH](/intensifies)
---
Dude calm down
---
I did it twice in 5 games yesterday. Once as Freddy once as Leatherface.
---
You missed something, when the hatch closes the gates are powered.  
---
Also the killer end game does move around the map but have 0 chance of finding an immersed survivor without perks.  
---
Also also 3 minutes is enough time AND it slows down when there are injured and dying state survivors.  
---
Also SOME of you like long intense games but most dont make them long and intense they make them long and boring and waste other peoples time to troll. Legion got killed immediately because survivors hated them, the end game has sucked for killers since release.
---
i think hes a lot better than freddy now since he has an ability to deal with pallets and freddy cant hit people during the 7 second duration
---
&gt;g hatch powers doors (aka 5 gens do
---
Why would the hatch be opened in the first place?
---
Imagine how this will work with Blood Warden
---
I'm hyped!
---
I *love* this imagery, thank you.
---
Freddy with remember me.
---
You leave that guy on the hook cause he’s dead lmao. Or just stay and get impaled too.
---
Personally, I still prefer that survivors don't do this unless I'm already at the exit gate. I don't really care to go all the way across the map to the other exit gate when the game is over just to get 300 more points.
---
It looks like the timer slows down pretty significantly when it does, like it looks to take almost twice as long. Is that about right?
---
This is ridiculous from every view i look at it from.
---
That's if the killer chooses to go there. Now he doesn't have to, and can just stay inside the trial waiting for all of the survivors to leave.
---
I don't think the helmets get a timer, when you open the gates as killer. Only when a gen is popped by survivors
---
It is my blood yes
---
How... does that even make sense?
---
Yeah
---
i mean it’s a legitimate thing. you have to realize that they have the combo really quick to adjust the way you play against them
---
It really is dude, trust me. I stay there so the killer wastes just a few seconds with me that could be crucial to another survivor that's stuck inside the trial.
---
Sooo, Left Behind is officially useless now?
---
And what if it’s one or two survivors and hatch is closed? They played perfectly all game but can’t get a gate open cuz they’re right next to each other and billy is patrolling like crazy?
---
Escape Cake just gives 100% BP in all catagories. You don’t have to escape for it to work, lmaooooooo
---
That relies on luck. You lose half you 4ks doing that.
---
It acts as a concede button
---
Legit never happend to me yet but good on you i guess, i rarely play killer tho so
---
What will happen to hatch standoffs? 
---
Of course it's a moot point if the killer closes the hatch. But what if the killer decides to be a douche and just sits on the hatch without closing it?
---
Same as before? Lone survivor condemned to do gens until killer leaves?
---
I doubt that. Look at 36 seconds in the video. There are 4 survivors, 4 gens, and the end game starts
---
Blood Warden is a one-and-done perk, once its activated, it stays that way for 60 seconds
---
&lt;a href = "https://i.imgur.com/y9dq0xB.jpg" target = "blank"&gt;late hook rescue?&lt;/a&gt;
---
I'm so excited.
---
0 counterplay?
---
He knew it was an ash, so that perk was expected. Chainsaw him - Perk will never activate.
---
Please let me know your definition of counterplay in case you disagree
---
^ this
---
Yeah, it's always rough when the matching system puts a seasoned killer against a group of baby survivors, and vice-versa.
---
Regarding the challenges survivors face in particular, I feel like it would really help if the devs added more perks that help survivors counter some of the more frustrating tactics killers employ like hook-guarding, slugging, etc. More importantly, speaking generally now, combining said perk additions with a new way for players to unlock specific perks quickly and more easily would be instrumental in lessening that perk gap between established players and new players, making DBD more of a level playing field. Skill gap should be the determining factor in who wins and who loses, not the perk grind.
---
That’s not in the killer’s favor?
---
honestly agree, with the new game cancellation on dc in pregame theres no longer an excuse to leave in the middle of the game
---
So do all killers get an animation when they open the gates now and do they have to take time to open them like survivors or can killers open them instantly?
---
They just need to remove the ability to hatch grab and this is perfect
---
Why not leave the game how it is now ? :(
---
Question, and sorry if i'm directly replying to your post to ask but I'm curious
---
"When end game activates, all generators will be blocked by the entity"
---
So this means if 1 survivor is left, the killer closes the hatch and the exit gates are powered, how does this affect the achievement "Left behind"?
---
https://i.imgur.com/y9dq0xB.jpg late hook rescue?
---
That's an interesting angle but okay.
---
Looks badass
---
I dont LOLOL if its 2x BP and a bunch of Streamers go off i just get farmed by an Ace
---
Check the dev post in this thread, he says it can do apparently
---
they hated eladmada because he told them the truth
---
Imagine watermarking such a bad meme
---
I am fully in support of this, I had one annoying straggler that held the game hostage for ten minutes last night before I found them. I then wasted their time by making the bleed to death.
---
By far, the most interesting aspect of this is the fact the killer can open the gates now. There's gonna be some serious strategy behind doing it though.
---
I’m excited most to see how endgame perks are gonna change to accommodate for this new endgame. Especially Blood Warden Left Behind and possibly NOED or Remember Me.
---
100% this.
---
The entity should do this to people that have Stage 3 crows for 5+ minutes
---
Not going to go far without the alien blaster.
---
If you care so much about the 4k, use Whispers or Bitter Murmur.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
No matter HOW MANY gens are left the hatch WILL spawn
---
Getting stunned, it rewards them for getting stunned
---
&gt; I’m also wondering why anytime a survivor complains about killer buffs it’s killers saying “you’re just not good” but when killers complain about survivor buffs the game is “unbalanced”?
---
Simple. The game is survivor-favored, so if you find yourself consistently struggling as a survivor main you're not a very good survivor, but things that make the game more survivor-favored make the game more imbalanced.
---
Can they do this before all the generators complete? The fact that once the collapse starts all the gens get locked implies this
---
No, it can be uncounterable, if you have to flip the pallet
---
That will be pretty strong, I’ll definitely say at first glance. An extra thirty seconds at 50% speed will be rough to counter but also remember Freddy is getting a rework soon and may totally change him and how he interacts with the game so we need to keep radar on that.
---
yeah, you're right, that is pretty weird. That has to be left over from some previous testing since it contradicts some statements made on twitter by devs today.
---
Hahahaha
---
What about multiple keys? If the killer closes it once from when it was opened with a key, it powers the exit gates, could then a different survivor who has a key open the hatch again? Could make for some interesting scenarios.
---
I thought this is gonna be some game changing mechanics or something that will change the end game.
---
From my understanding as a noob, the only good thing is that you can close the hatch as a killer, and the survivors won't wait 10 minutes for teabags in front of the gates. 
---
But..otherwise the timer doesn't help in anyway if they open the gate and if they're at the gate.
---
It rewards them for getting stunned, also takes 0 skill  just gives a free hit for by doing bad
---
He also wears a red string around his wrist.
---
I think a cool way to re-balance it is tie the perk directly to the end game collapse. NOED activates when gates are powered, for every totem still up the EGC timer goes down at a faster rate, maybe ~3% per totem allowing for nearly a fifth of the timer to be taken if no totems were broken, but on top of that give the killer the old buffs of NOED as well of slightly faster movement and built in unrelenting to the perk. As for the exposed affect I would prefer it either stays at level 3, or just make the other 2 buffs more prominent and actually get rid of the exposed effect, having faster movement, faster swings, and a shorter EGC timer seems powerful enough for end game.
---
I love the idea, but I'm still annoyed knowing it will do nothing to stop asshole survivors from taunting, spamming vaults and wasting time at the exit gates before the timer runs out.
---
Same, now I can let survivors teabag the gate and not even show up, so they get sacrificed by the Entity.
---
I don't think it changes much about toxicity. 3 minutes is a long time to stick around spamming vault booms.
---
Bodyblock gamer hours
---
It also gives tie survivor points so not sure what the big deal is also it’s super easy to fight against
---
There have been numerous issues with Exit Gates spawning too close to one another on certain maps. If the killer can close the hatch and force the countdown, what can a single survivor do if the exit gates are within line of sight of each other?
---
They have to change it now. The only time it can be used is when you're the only one left and the hatch hasn't been closed. And if you choose doing gens over trying to find the hatch before the killer, you're a mad lad.
---
Maybe something like noed is deactivated if a hooked survivor is within x/y/z radius? Or within your terror radius?
---
Eh. Doesn't even need mic. I do it for randoms if it's down to just the two of us. It's the smart play. If there's no chance of survival, why not give the other survivor a chance? If anything it sounds like the killer is the sore loser if he/she gets upset at that.
---
The devs said they would be rebalancing some perks for the end game collapse and I imagine this will be one of them.
---
No, the only reason they wont change it is because reddit will cry, in their killer circle jerk
---
The only meme that has ever made me laugh, love it!
---
If the two gates are on the same long wall like on Yamoka or MacMillan, then that will be harder to open normally, yes but even billy needs to actually travel that distance and can’t be in two places at once. If these survivors are playing perfect they’ll know to apply pressure on both sides because the killer is only one person and if survivors are in two places he has to travel still. Even billy or nurse has to still take time.
---
Pig for sure does that 😂
---
Her and Myers always scare my soul out of my body LOL
---
Don't worry, they'll still use those 3 minutes to be as toxic as they can before leaving.
---
Like the other comment mentioned, it isnt really something thats supposed to happen every game or at all if all players are playing normally. Its for groups that grief the killer and never leave
---
I'm pretty sure it's cause most people didn't buy the DLC. Quentin has nothing really visually appealing going for him and his perks aren't useful in most cases.
---
Also, the fact that Freddy was never a really good killer that people enjoyed, and his perks aren't the great either, so not much reason to buy the DLC at all.
---
Yeah. So if the killer chooses to it'll spawn. What's the problem?
---
I'm confused. So the killer can close the hatch to start the timer but why is the hatch open to begin with when more than one survivor remains
---
it does...
---
You’re right but not everyone plays SWF or can coordinate like this.
---
I’m totally down for that. It may be overkill but also considering how much stronger an endgame build can become (implying NOED or bloodwarden doesn’t change) it may not even happen.
---
Good catch. If a pig gets lucky and has 3-4 traps on survivors, they can open the gate and nab some kills.
---
I’ve had killer dailies where the last survivor would hide in a locker and AFK hoping I’d DC, so it honestly made me LOL. And agreed, there’s no way they didn’t specifically choose Dwight on purpose because we constantly dunk on him for hiding!

Thanks!
---
Downvoted in first 45 seconds of being up. I guess it’s always been this way and I’m just noticing.
---
No, but it has always been full of survivors who have complained since release, because they started in a world where they got free wins through infinites and now they have to get their free wins through skill (and still *some* infinites) :)
---
This is a buff to NOED if anything
---
The killer can also open the gate at any point to force you out
---
How long is this for??
---
Just powered, survivor still needs to pull the lever.
---
I think Blood Warden is now a must-run for Pig. Amanda got a huge buff with this new mechanic.
---
Lol you stalking me now?
---
Really? I see alot more survivor bs than killer.
---
Looks cool but wow, some many unforeseen meta changes. Bloodwarden, pig, jeese
---
That's what I'm saying
---
And? If someone does something stupid and gets punished for it, that's how things should work. If someone does something stupid or shitty and someone else gets punished for it, that's bad design.
---
Welcum2plebbit
---
do gens have to be done in order for killer to open the gates? also in case when killer closes the hatch with only 1 person left, does that power the exit gates automatically?
---
The big deal is that having it on strong killers makes it way to op, it gives the killer free hits and if you think survivors getting 1000 points makes up for the killer winning the game through a perk that is op then i dont know what youre thinking
---
Tell me wvery detai!
---
Lol freaking facts. Same with hag especially if u don't know it's her yet and she has her traps set up in random spots, like alley ways in Halloween Town.
---
The second it got sick of listening to all cry-hard survivor mains.
---
Adrenaline is crazy good sometimes. When it helps it really helps
---
I WISH THEY WOULD ADD A PERK THAT WOULD LET YOU MORI A FELLOW SURVIVOR FOR BEING A DIP SHIT.
---
It already is tbh
---
That attempt at correcting you tho lol
---
SICK
---
This is excellent. *Finally* the devs are adding a mechanic that lights a fire under the asses of the survivors, as opposed to just letting them run around without a care in the world at the end of the match.
---
It's so jarring the difference between killer and survivor. You can't waste a single second as killer while a survivor can literally crouch around fully immersed all match and still make it out the hatch if their teammates do the work.
---
If the survivors arent coordinated then they will need to bring perks to assist with that. I can already see things like Wake Up or aura sharing being much more desireable to keep everyone on task. 
---
Hell with someone like Empathy or Kindred or even Bond, the survivors can have more room to share that knowledge in solo. Survivors have many tools, you just have to utilize them.
---
WAKE UP! Buff?
---
Just powered. You could briefly see from the survivors POV the gate aura appearing, but the door still closed.
---
I dont get end game collapse, from the trailer it said entity will block generators?  Does that mean the killer can just open the gate and start the count down?
---
"End Game Collaps" ....you mean the ultimate "fuck you killer, no fun allowed" patch ?
---
They have to be by a gen for murmur im pretty sure
---
Pig with Make Your Choice in the End Game would be quite fun. Hooked survivor is trapped, saving them exposes their savior, and they have to get their trap off, all while quickly approaching the Collapse. There’s some true SAW style tension there.
---
I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed people like this exist it’s a video game unless someone is literally going out of their way to piss you off there’s no reason to be mad , also bhvr balances the game to be mostly 2 dead 2 escaped.
---
Getting stunned doesn’t equal to play poorly. I get stunned when I play killer fairly often because I don’t respect pallets and get them gone as fast as possible. That’s not playing bad.
---
If you know a killer has the perk, just drop the pallet earlier.
---
Pretty much all big multiplayer games have test servers. They're not used to fix *everything*, just to make sure nothing gamebreaking happens (and any other changes they can squeeze in).
---
Right now the hatch requires 2 gens completed and 3 survivors gone/3 gens and 2 survivors gone/4 gens and 1 survivor gone/ 5 gens before spowning. Making it spawn no matter how many gens are left is a buff
---
r/dbdbgonewild
---
Want to end teabagging? Walk backwards into the exit gate. You never see it and they aren’t satisfied because you had your backed turned.
---
I think a lot of killers just want a fair game as well. The toxic shit heads among us don’t speak for us and I think that’s part of the problem.
---
It would be creepy AF if the spike pulled survivors into the ground instead their body just dissolving on it.
---
it happened to me only once but luckily the killer wanted to farm so i didn't get my cheeks completely clapped in game
---
Game is a shit map for HillBilly/Huntress, they thrive on outdoor maps. Besides, The Game was given a few more safe pallets and it's a much better map if you run Balanced Landing.
---
Calling Left Behind a crutch is like calling a Tombstone Myers a ranged killer.
---
Legion died for this
---
It is just collapse started early.
---
What's interesting about that? Sounds boring af
---
Its good that you hide the score, because those fanatics will mori your karma for sure !
---
Apparently I'm not a killer main and have never dealt with old decisive strike. Thanks for educating me.
---
Practically no counter play? It's one of the perks that have quite a bit of counter play to it. There was only 1 way that COMPLETELY countered decisive strike, but the rest of the things you could do made it much easier to deal with. Annoying when used 4 times on you maybe if they get lucky and they get downed in a no hook zone, but still not op. Of course there's the common "run enduring" but you could do things to impact it's effects, like dribbling, angling them so when they get off your shoulder they fall off a ledge, and my favorite: angle them so when they get off your shoulder they go into a "corner" where they can't move anywhere until the ds stun timer runs out so you can immediately down them again. People who had no idea how to deal with ds were the only ones who complained
---
Lol don’t know what to really tell ya I don’t think the perk OP at all and do not have a problem with it as I just counter it but hey opinions opinions
---
you dont need SWF for that... you have some time to talk to ur teammates each time before a match starts, guess what people in the upper ranks actually do. ;)
---
Tbagging, flashing a light on and off to get my attention, doing doughnuts to make movement to lure me away, etc. If you bait and do a good job of it GG...if you're obviously trying to lure me away from someone, then I'm going for them.
---
Gen rushing isn't real lol
---
Duh
---
Is the mori me having a stroke trying to read this post?
---
DBD + Persona. Okay now I've seen everything.
---
it actually is just that easy. ;)
---
Bugs Bunny   
---
"no"
---
Well I guess our humour is different
---
You never saw it coming.
---
Dbd is definitely killer sided vs solo queue but swf its easily survivor sided unless nurse
---
That trapper bag was great! Haha.
---
If the Killer finds the hatch first they can just close it, so doing gens instead is pointless.
---
Cultivating mass bro
---
Do you think the hatch will still spawn when the desired amount of gens is done? Or will it only spawn with 1 survivor left?
---
If the killer closes the hatch a survivor could open it back up with a key.
---
Might finally start playing the game again after a year absense. This is basic crap that I have been begging for a year and a half to add to the game (and Reddit downvoted and flamed me for daring to suggest there should be a forced end to a match after a couple minutes to eliminate end game BM...or that the hatch should always spawn if there is one survivor left so leavers don't instantly screw over the entire team).
---
Why though? They are additive, not multiplicative
---
Both of those were shown in the video
---
OR a friendly farming killer politely releases his harvest :D ...i mean suvivor who got a lot of bp !
---
Yes once hatch is closed gates will be powered. And no I doubt killers can open the gate lol they prob just fucked up on the wording
---
It could be, but most devs don't like having 2 separate versions of the games for PC and Console (unless they're a huge company like Blizzard Activision)
---
I already enjoy playing against the pig for 'oh shit' end game scenarios. This will turn it up to 11 😂
---
I still find it piss easy to win on the game as killer. Other than those two killers that you named most will benefit from it.
---
Then neither is tunnelling ;)
---
So Sprint burst...?
---
And what will happen to the ability killers to catch survivors when they jump into the hatch - will that stay ? Cause it will create some serious imbalance when they both see the hatch. The survivor has to run away regadless because he will either be caught while jumping or  the killer will close it under him
---
He mentioned it in a streamer's chat. Didn't say what the changes were though. I've been trying to find proof in the VOD but I don't know exactly when he said it. I'll edit if I find it.
---
Me looking for immersed Claudette
---
Never thought I would think of Legion as a hero, I’m literally crying and shaking. #RIPMYBOI.
---
The difference is, both parties now have the ability to act. Killers are no longer helpless against the hatch, and as a killer main, I WILL be closing it the moment I find it.
---
Yeah I was gonna fix it but it was pretty funny so I let it stay.
---
The trap timer starts automatically if the exit gates are powered, so as soon as the hatch is closed it will start ticking.
---
I'm not that into Mortal Kombat, can someone please explain?
---
That’s fine too though, if you get hooked after the gates are open it should be worse right? Like you should be playing more cautious to survive?
---
Apologies that 90% of the people that go "DS was not op lul" are survivor mains.
---
There was literally hardly any counter play to the perk at all - you don't always have corners or ledges, hell it's quite rare that i've found (And Balanced Landing exists). Being forced to run a perk to counter a get out of jail free card that takes zero effort is just dumb and should not be a thing. It was shitty, and there's no argument against that.
---
Yeah but you cant guarantee to put thw pallet fown early, the killer can be to near,  and if you just run through it the killer will just hit you after since they dont respect pallets
---
I had no expectations and I'm still let down.
---
Good.
---
Actually that’s not true. Madness 3 doesn’t stop the unhooking action, it’s specifically the shock animation (from getting hit by shock therapy) that will cancel the unhook action for 2-3 seconds.
---
They've already said on the forums NOED is remaining as is, other perks are getting looked at/changed however.
---
Literally not comparable.
---
Not necessarily, if the killer is actually trying to camp the hatch to trap the survivor then it would be useful for the survivor to do gens. I mean, if you it's obviously a massive nerf, making it basically useless but not completely.
---
It isn't an event...
---
I legit never noticed this...about 1200 hours here.
---
I play a lot of solo survivors and honestly, the hatch spawning even with 0 gens completed sounds amazing. I no longer have to die if my team is braindead and doesn't do gens. As for escaping, it starts working when the gates are opened, and at that point there is no reason for waiting 3 minutes. The hatch closing could be hard to deal with, but EVERYTHING is better than what we had before. 30 minutes of looking the killer in the eyes is not fun
---
Agreed. Even better, this is a significant buff to Trapper and Hag, since they can trap the exit gates, allowing them to "hedge their bets", so to speak.
---
If you run up to a gate, and it's almost opened, and you don't want to leave it, and you haven't found the hatch, you can open the gate, camp the exit, and force survivors to find and open the other exit/hatch in 3 minutes.
---
You'd need a 1hit down effect, and preferably whispers or something so you know when you can ditch the camping.
---
It's pretty much made to make Krueger perks viable. Remember me cuts 30 seconds off their escape, Blood warden cuts at worst 60 seconds at half speed, so another 30 seconds, and at best if the survivor is unhooked in one second, a full 59 seconds. Chuck in no one escapes death and watch them weep.
---
I'm sorry tbagging upsets you so much snowflake.
---
That’s a shame. I keep getting NOED but I refuse to use it out of dignity. Guess I’ll keep doing that.
---
IM A TERRIBLE KILLER SO I SURVIVOR MAIN, BUT I HAD TO MORI SOMEONE FOR A DAILY AND GOT BULLIED 3 MATCHES IN A ROW SO I BROUGHT AN EBONY MORI, ONLY WAS ABLE TO KILL ONE PERSON (AGAIN IM BAD) AND AFTER THEY TOLD ME TO GET GOOD. I WAS PLAYING AGAINST A RANK 5, 8, 10, AND 16. I'M RANK 17 AS KILLER FIX MATCHMAKING
---
No, I mean like is this a permanent game mode of limited
---
No you need to use both pretty sure.
---
In any case they're manually reviewing reports, so the odds of a ban for playing normally are low.
---
Counter it since you prob dont verse it like every game, but ive degbunked all your arguments about it, and mine are all true, theres no way to counter them because they arent opinions buy they are facts
---
As far as I'm aware, that remains unchanged. So in that scenario the Survivor would have to jump in before the Killer gets close enough to grab them otherwise the Killer can:  
---
A) Close the hatch before the Survivor can attempt to escape.  
---
B) Catch the Survivor if they do attempt to escape.
---
Gotta use it smart tho,  i run mettle with dead hard and adrenaline, so i’ll get hit twice, 99 myself with self car, loop the killer until imm forced to use dead hard and then run more and waste a lil more time until you use a pallet. THEN heal and get that 3rd hit stack and hope adrenaline kicks in, more points if you bring a syringe so you can take yet another hit lol.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Can you explain what happened I don't get it?
---
In other competitive, multiplayer games like Overwatch, it’s always balanced for the top tier of play. So it should be balanced for SWF vs a rank 1 killer. But also SWF is kind of OP even tho I’ve only seen it on YouTube never played in one.
---
what an idiot
---
I assume if I went "yea toxic" you'd go "what's toxic about playing a killer that I like yadayada paid money for it yadayada entitled survivors" y'know? So I just skipped ahead of that. And it was legionplayers who pissed all over my house for 4 months.
---
They released a trailer today and someone appeared wearing that mask, I thought it looked similar to one of Huntresses masks lol
---
That's literally just haddonfield
---
Sounds like Bitter Murmur might have a shot at the meta now, and they didn't even have to buff it, nice.
---
This already encourages the killer to move around the map.

---
If a SFW is insisting on going for saves/jukes/etc, forcing the gate open is shunning them out and making it so that you don't waste your own time as a killer. 
---
Plus, if you can still somehow keep them down long enough (if they're the kind to always go for altruism and saves) after the collapse starts, then they'll either have to save their SWF or get out, which is neat. No longer is it a chore to get a kill. Either they wise up and get out, or they cut their losses.
---
Honestly, it feels like it’s full of die hard legion mains.
---
Wait why would that be a bad thing for that pig gameplay? If the pig is going to pitch her early game completely for an endgame strat, that’s fine imo. You better capitalize on that and rush and get out. Just like a card game like magic or hearthstone. If you give a late game deck too much time you lose.
---
The only difference is when there is 1 survivor left. The only diff is that two gens don't have to be done first, ensuring there will always be an endgame. It's a small buff.

Just had a game last night where killer was running ruin and haunted ground and NOED. Both hexes got cleansed and we had been proactive about cleansing dulls but gates opened and NOED activated. It was swamp. There was no way we were finding 1 remaining totem in that map, especially since the most obvious locations had already been checked. If NOED pops and you have three minutes to get out and you know there's only one totem possibly left, you're gonna cut your losses and bolt. It would probably take you longer than 3 minutes to find it at that point.
---
I made Bloodshard lollipops last Halloween.
---
aight man sure
---
Damn, is posting something obvious how you farm upvotes or something.
---
So whats stopping a killer from just opening the gates, staring at a corner and forcing everyone to depip?
---
Or open the gates, run into someone, down them with NOED and then facecamp them.
---
When the gens are done and the gates open, there are no more objectives on the map, which means that the killer has no way of knowing where the survivors are if they aren't at the exit gates and if the killer doesn't have wispers. This could lead to the survivor just hiding for half an hour untill the killer is forced to DC to end the match. There are other cases of holding the game hostage, like bodyblocking a survivor in a corner and then going afk as the killer, but this patch will fix the first type I described

---
So what exactly happens if you are the last survivor alive and hatch will be closed by a killer? Killer then knows exactly that you are gonna try to open either of the gates, making you easy target, impossible to escape unless timed perfectly.
---
Or maybe I'm just missing something.
---
If it actually worked half the time 😑
---
Finally, no more time wasting and needless griefing at eng game.
---
Yeah this. It’s not like he was high tier anyways...
---
Whats more interesting than see that p3 claudette absolutely mad that she can't open the gate while see her deaths come slowly. Souns really funny tho
---
Yeah, still works more often than dead hard though haha.
---
yea my only concern is I don't think it's fair if the killer can literally force a survivor to die from the EGC with no way to play around on the survivor side. Overall though I'm excited if this is implemented correctly.
---
As a 50/50 survivor killer, I can say with certainty that this sub leans towards killers, but not by a huge margin. If I had to guess, I'd say it is 60% killers.
---
Umm... huhhh?
---
I just edited it. But I'll put it here again so you don't have to go back to the other post. https://puu.sh/Dgxt1/aff035acc0.png
---
can't wait for noob3 and demi to check this shit out
---
Ok glad we straightened that out lul
---
Permanent change to the end game. It's also not a mode.
---
You can hardly do it in live, not to mention they're making feral speed slower.
---
ok but then when the killer slug, dont cry to him
---
Besides the realife stuff, how about " NEVER DC YOU SCUM" ?!? How about not being a dick once ? Idc wich role, this goes to everyone !
---
Are you that afraid of tbagging
---
Blood warden will probably be adjusted with this new system.
---
Ooo I'm loving this. Could be super tense. I wonder if the Hatch still follows the current spawn rules while also being able to spawn at 4 or 5 gens left. Like if there's one person dead and 1 gen left if it will still spawn by these rules and remain closed, and I wonder if keys can still be used on the hatch if the killer closes it. I ASSUME both will be the case, just curious and excited.
---
Closing the hatch “powers up the gates” as in letting survivors perform the “open exit gates” action as if the gens were all powered.
---
200IQ post right here
---
Too late.
---
1. Everyone hated legion
---
2. Legion gets nerfed into Oblivion
---
3. Everyone loves legion
---
Idk man
---
Knowing where everyone is good information even if you can't reach them right away.
---
That new entity sacrifice animation looks awesome!! And the red particle effects on the ground o.o
---
Both are simply one side completing their objective.
---
Ayy thanks dude
---
best girl
---
So basically it's going to become more of a crutch perk than it already was. Great.
---
Killers can open the gate as long as gens are powered or the hatch is open. It's worded very clearly, and used as a way to ensure survivors can't linger. Killer opens the gate to start the timer, which could be useful if you've got people hooked to prevent altruistic saves.
---
Sounds like a lying survivor main to me.
---
I just described that there was counter play. You have to realize that running ds was a risk. They waste a perk slot in hopes that they even have the chance to use it in a good place.
---
 Balanced landing does exist but that requires them to have it equipped which is another perk slot just so they don't get staggered and downed when you basically threw them off an edge. I hate the mentality of "get out of jail free card" because it was only a get out of jail free card if it was used right next to an open exit gate, otherwise, it was a chase extender most of the time, it didnt get much use if there were no good pallets/vaults around too.
---
 It was a whole perk slot that a survivor didn't even guarentee they'd get to use. Obsession gets dribbled and non-obsession has to pray/coordinate with their teammates just to get the chance to use it since hooks tend to be all over the place. Also enduring is a solid perk, if you don't respect pallets you probably should run enduring, it helping against ds was just a pleasant addition to an already good perk.
---
If you are chasing a Survivor and they run to the hatch, they WILL get out unless you are in quick-attack range. Remeber, lunges don't result in grabs.
---
Same
---
If your teammate was dumb enough to unhook you in my TR, and you were dumb enough to run away leaving tracks and blood all over the place, it would be irresponsible of me NOT to go after you. However when I return to an unhook notification, I don't usually go out of my way to find the unhooked guy, it's all about who I see first.
---
I got it last night. Do you have to reach a certain level with blood points to use it?
---
sounds kinda op
---
ah, I see interesting. although remember timer slows down when survivors are on the floor or on the hook so survivors will still have time to make saves
---
In what possible way am I doing that?
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/412637846?t=6670s
---
Care to elaborate?
---
It definitely fits the lore much better. The Entity likes to give hope then rip it away at the last minute. Old hatch neutered killers, this new one feels perfect to what the Entity does
---
Thanks everyone 😊
---
Yep. Both are. One ruins the game for a player.
---
Oh I wasn't playing the game when he dropped that's why I didn't get it like I stopped when the clown came out. Thank you
---
Nope, it’ll appear randomly like any other perk.
---
REAL SUFFERING IS NOT KNOWN
---
it is confirmed to be coming in the mid-chapter patch https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57097/developer-update-april-2019
---
AND FUCK ME, DEATH IS NO ESCAPE
---
Big facts, play games to have fun. I have some fun against prayer beads. I don't against heads.
---
I hope that they add something that punishes survivors that sit in the exit gate area. Hopefully something for whenever a survivor sits idle in that area the timer has time taken off or it ticks faster and when multiple survivors are sitting there healing each other the timer ticks even faster. They should also add that when a survivor loots a crate during the end game 15 seconds or so is taken off the timer (it being applied when the box is fully looted).
---
This isn't how that meme format works.
---
As does an SWF group bashing out the gens in 3 minutes with Prove Thyself and purple toolboxes...
---
You guys realize that this only effects the pallet breaking when you vault? Previously, you had to have hit someone and apply Deep Wound to them and THEN any pallet you vaulted would be broken.
---
Happens to me often.
---
4 gens left and the last guy is not even finish a gen but just hiding.
---
So anti fun
---
Yes, but the survivor still has to open the gates. What I'm saying is that it's up to the killer to decide when they want the standoff to end, since they alone can close the hatch. 
---
Ex. Trapper standing on hatch, sees survivor hiding, closes hatch and goes in for the kill. What can the survivor do at that point? 
---
The survivor could just 99% gens, yes that's true, however once they power the gens, the killer can freely close the hatch and patrol the gates, which basically makes it so endgame kills the survivor at that point.
---
Ex. I 99% all 5 gens to power gates, and set them off. Exit gates are powered, but because I'm the only survivor, endgame begins. Killer closes hatch, because they have zero penalty for doing so and proceeds to patrol gates. This is always in the killers advantage.
---
The survivor in the second case does have the ability to run to hatch if the killer sees what they're up to, but the killer can also bait and close hatch.
---
I feel like this is certainly one step closer to ending the standoffs, but perhaps if the hatch has been spawned for too long with nothing happening, it teleport to another location? Could make things more interesting.
---
In the gameplay it shows entity blocking gens while collapse has started and 4 survivors are running around, does anyone get the point of entity blocking gens here?
---
its a really good perk it always allows you to know where the killer is and i think thats pretty good its a good perk for people who are good at looping
---
this one legit made me laugh
---
You arnt around her for long are you ? Because people like echo chambers and cirlejerks, they love being the anonymous dick on the internet and in video-games.
---
Question!! It was mentioned that if it's one person left, the hatch will spawn and survivors can't work on gens, so will it be closed forever unless you have a key, or is it only closed for a set period of time?
---
Running a loop once or twice and dropping a pallet also takes no skill.  Whats your point?
---
The problem here is that you equate 'getting stunned' with playing bad. 
---
Not respecting pallets is the best thing you can do as a killer. Especially if you're just running Enduring alone. Every killer should eventually just learn to swing through and force the pallet drop rather than letting the survivor milk it for another loop or two. 
---
It's interesting that you think making the correct play in 90% of loop scenarios is 'doing bad'
---
serious question, why is it common on this sub to be so adversarial? Why is everyone a "salty survivor" or "butthurt killer" ?
---
We've all seen them
---
What's a meme
---
doot
---
If you said yeah toxic i probably wouldnt even have responded at all
---
S A T I R E
---
I hope there's a time limit or something so people don't troll and start it as soon as the game starts
---
Cringe fanyboy, jesus this is so freaking cringey...
---
Awesome
---
Left behind is now more useless then before, which I thought was impossible
---
You’re 100% right. I see A LOT of killers running NOED and abusing this end game. All you would have to do is immediately open a gate and camp it and hope that the other gate is near.
---
Nah man. Just apply pressure. Git gud.  Don't know why you care if 3 guys do a gen with prove thyself, means you literally know where 3 of them are at once with only 1 gen. What an odd complaint. 
---
Im not even arsed about tunnelling, it usually goes hand in hand with campers tho. Luckily bhvr know its shitty and so have introduced perks to counter it.
---
that would cause a pretty big problem if that was the case. talk about making survivors lose so much damn points unless all survivors get the points of the 5 gens getting done
---
If you're running an endgame build you can rush the game into endgame and get more out of your build.
---
You can open gates in tier 3 madness. You scream but you can still open it.
---
Huh? The end game collapse will finish all of the gens
---
Don't forget that he probably has noed.
---
I mean, he looks a little depressed. But in terms of proportions and identifiable characteristics, it's pretty damn good !
---
Isnt the word "Fuck" the most used word in America for a reason ? You can express so many emotions with it XD
---
Well, time to start saying goodbye to solo queue survivor and hello to a swf group.
---
I just hate he gains stacks for breaking with his chainsaw.
---
Am I missing something?
---
Why would the killer want to start end game?
---
Even better
---
wait
---
&gt; Both survivors and killers(?) can open the gate
---
finna down ya ass open ya gate and blood warden ya ass
---
Ah okay - didn't recall that. Thanks.
---
I rarely play against piggy - mostly billys.
---
I hope the endgame change shakes the meta up a little bit :)
---
I mean that’s kind of the point. The killer is supposed to be faster otherwise they’d be totally destroyed by survivors. That’s why you learn how to loop and use pallets and stuff
---
ik what I am saying is if the killer could do it at any time the survivors would not be getting much points if the killer say did it at the start of the game
---
Right— meaning the survivors won’t get those gen objective points
---
I guess they'll have to change the left behind achievement then
---
If you’re the last one then the killer has 9/10 demolished you and your last possibly grim Hope is to either open that gate quickly or accept your fate.
---
If that's the case I imagine we'll see the following happen to all the survivor-main streamers at some point:
---
* Load into game
---
* 10-15 seconds later End Game Collapse activates
---
* Regardless of what happens, game ends and probably everyone de-pips/safety pips due to the completely lack of a game happening
---
* Complaints start how it's impossible to make content now
---
* Commence twitter bitching and BHVR tweaking the gate opening to only occur under more stringent circumstances
---
How so?
---
To speed the game up or if they have to leave or something, to get out of an irritating game quicker, etc.
---
As a survivor main I ma really excited. At least it will make my decision easier when it comes to saving others on hooks in the endgame. Oh, and of course t-bagging at gates and camping the hatch will be punished. Good times.
---
Some survivors enjoy sneaking around the map long after the gates are opened, wasting the killers time and preventing the game from ending. 'holding the game hostage'
---
Imagine thinking a something that only works after kicking 2 pallets has no counterplay.
---
Hmmm I see
---
Spirit's ultra rares are pretty dang good. Everyone else's you mentioned ARE absolute trash though haha.
---
I immediately thought of pig and how much she can do with this. Oh they opened the hatch let’s close that shit up and start the end game. Oh looks like you can’t leave you have a trap on your head!
---
Why does it suck for solo survivors?
---
On 23rd there will be PTB. Then it will be live in a week or two after that.
---
Well I’m guessing if this was the case it would give you points to compensate otherwise that would be an extremely large oversight
---
Well technically it will still be possible, since End Game Collapse activates on a gate being opened, not the gens being completed. The gates just become powered/gens locked off in a situation where the killer closes the hatch. 
---
I imagine that anyone who wants to get the achievement
---
also I doubt the killer could do it at the start that would prob make it so a lot of ppl would just stop playing
---
I'd find starting another match more interested to be honest lol
---
Legion was hated
---
Legion Update announced 
---
Killer Mains assumed it would be a rebalance to make him fun and fair
---
BHVR instead nerfs him to the ground
---
Day after BHVR announces a fun and balanced endgame
---
Oooooh shit
---
Both sides say the same thing about each other. I hear a lot of survivors complaining the game is too 'killer orientated' and you will hear same from killers in discussions over things like MoM etc.   
---
If you main one side or the other you lack perspective so you will complain that the other side is too good, why its good to play both so you understand the good and bad of being both.
---
Oh, okay.
---
I can see the resemblance between that mask and Huntress' Hound Mask.
---
Devs in this thread have indirectly confirmed that blood warden will stay the same, blocking the exit gates for 60 seconds when a survivor is hooked.
---
That wouldn't really benefit the killer any. If the killer closes the hatch then he only needs to patrol both doors. One survivor opening a door up without the killer stopping them is pretty unlikely.
---
I legit went into a laughing fit - highest quality meme in the west
---
A killer made for tunnelling. This sounds fun!
---
Well, that is exactly what they did to Legion. Make the stabs unrewarding.
---
Dunno about PC, but in console it is a placebo.
---
Or *my perks are best during endgame and I want to use them now thank you.*
---
I really hope this works out it well. I play both survivor and killer and this just gives me so much hype and worry on both ends. 
---
Worry 1: Can the killer immediately collapse the game at anytime? If so, I get the feeling we’ll get a few that will collapse at the start and NOED will need to be changed. (Not complaining about the NOED part though...)
---
Worry 2: Will immersed survivors try and force the killer to collapse by not touching gens?
---
Thoughts?
---
Here's an upboat back. You are entirely correct in everything that you've said. I love your unpopular opinion but it's more of a fact. ;)
---
broke: to play around perks like blood warden and prevent further stalls
---
woke: deny survivors 1500 objective points
---
I thought this was a neat little unintended effect. It looked like Mettle of Man was giving him a visual shield.
---

---
Will I be able to open the hatch again with a key if the killer closes it? 🥺
---
Ah fuck just realized that, wanted a killer who had really good tracking.
---
i would agree but i think in terms of what best solution i think it would be completely changing their power
---
One of my biggest complaints when playing killer is when you have 1 immersed survivor who holds the game hostage for 20 minutes when the other 3 have died/escaped. 
---
This is amazing.
---
Legit one dude was just running into me and playing stupidly. I hooked all of them at one point because I was just playing the game but when I killed the dude who I had chased for a good while, I got called a tunneler by one of the other survivors. 
---
What? Was I supposed to just not chase someone?
---
I guess it depends on the killer and what state the game is in. If you're a killer who has speed and map presence (like billy or nurse) you can afford an immediate collapse no matter what as it's fairly easy to control the gates. If not, you may want to hatch camp until they get close enough to see or a gen pops, and then initiate a chase after closing it.
---
As a survivor you're now encouraged to actively run and search for the hatch **before** the killer can find it/get to it instead of cautiously sneaking around until you come upon it, which in turn makes it more likely for a chase to happen. The hatch is no longer a guaranteed escape, but rather a glimmer of hope as someone else put it.
---
Basically: There is nothing stopping killers from hatch camping. You're now playing the killer's game and your best hope when a killer gets to the hatch before you is to do gens and apply pressure to the killer to either see if you can lure them away without closing it or having them activate the collapse and hoping you're good enough to avoid detection long enough to open a gate or find a key.
---
lmfao
---
Keys can reopen hatches. And why are you acting like you deserve to escape? You don't deserve to escape just because you're the last one alive. Earn that shit. Trick the nurse. Lose her, then go to the other door. Survivors still very much have a chance to escape as the last one in a trial. It's just not gifted to you now like it used to be
---
Rip dbd, rip survivor main, rip teamwork. Devs, I hope you are looking forward to step back on that decision because it's killing the game. No more time to have slow but really brutal game, it's only a rush to the end and ez pez lemon squeezy for all the killers.
---
I'm not a main anything I like to play both but it's ruining the game, just looking like this Last Year bitch. Nobody is doing a good teamwork on 13-20 rank and now that we can't rank properly, people are going to be stuck rank 20 with noobs and newbies forever.
---
At least leave the choice to player and introduce this mode only for talented players, like after rank 10 because before that it will be impossible
---
Lol yeah honestly though I’d play the detective. There should be a character who’s all about tracking
---
Killer can’t close the hatch if it’s the last survivor
---
At the 35 second mark end game starts with 4 gens left and everyone alive, howd it get triggered there?
---
Correct. They could close it and patrol but they can also wait for the survivor to reveal where they are before closing it by either waiting for the surv to approach the hatch or completing a gen. So they basically made it really hard to escape as the final survivor.
---
Will this mean killers won't be able to interrupt the hatch jump? Because if not, I don't see the downside to camping the hatch as killer and just slapping it closed if the survivor comes over, even activating end game perks like NOED.
---
Yeah, the solution to that is doing the remaining X gens if you're alone, but that really draws out the game instead of immediately activating the double exit gate duel.
---
Well they did good by legion then gave us this. Can’t wait to be the only one to do anything all match, have all my teammates die, and then have the hatch shut on me. Whooo!
---
If the killer can open an exit, this just sounds like an easy way to let killers de-pip.  instead of standing there and letting the survivors turn on generators, you just open the gate for them.
---
If the hatch still follows normal spawn rules, it can't be closed until a reasonable point, but opening gates for the killer seems like a bad idea.
---
Survivor main here, I absolutely love this. Gives the game more depth and also gives more power to the killer (which is very much needed, and the hatch spawning always once all other survivors are dead is so nice because it felt like such an impossible task to escape on your own otherwise.
---
That's because Rancor is not an aura-reading perk. Lockers only block auras
---
It is clear on who is the better Myers here.
---
Come on, not even a Myers profile pic? They're not even trying.
---
That's just an example. They would've shown the killer opening it if that is the intention.
---
No, once the hatch closes the gens are blank cked off. You can't work on generators even if you wanted to.
---
I've never been so erect.
---
I remember one time I hooked a survivor 3 times in a row. Then, after the survivor got rescued, she LITERALLY ran straight towards me, FACING me. Then I downed her, and she disconnected.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
You got that backwards, they fucked up with Legion, but then redeemed themselves with this!
---
Or would it be cool to see Myer's pry the door open with them beefy arms
---
Adrenaline, a perk that lets you heal one state if you've made it to the end game, and MoM, a perk that only activates if you let a survivor heal 3 times, then injure them again without downing them? So it's countered by T3 Myers, either chainsaw boy, devour hope, NOED, various killer add-ons, and just hooking them each time they're injured instead of letting them get away and heal?
---
You're absolutely right, zero counterplay on two abilities that are just completely shut down by playing well as killer.
---
Nah. They really didn’t.
---
I‘ll probably let myself die everytime just to see the sacrifice animation. Dayumn
---
You lost me at wraith can be as dangerous as a nurse.
---
Oh no, whatever will the Left Behind users do?
---
L2 Loop
---
Still pretty good.
---
&gt; Put RBT on every survivor
---
lol all you whining about this but it's near impossible to do that
---
Yeah this wasn’t really thought through.
---
Hopefully they balance the perks better. It's kind of boring starting a game already knowing 3 of the killers perks.
---
...If BBQ is on the shrine when I check tonight I might kms. I literally spent Sunday-Tuesday leveling him up to 35...
---
Yeah, yeah they did.
---
Before this thread, I've always thought I was the only one. Lmao. Love ya Tru3!
---
Tool would be correct.
---
Are you Tru3's alt? ;) But seriously, there's hardly anyone insulting his (tremendous) ego in this thread. The unpopular opinions are honestly the opinions of those who recognize his douchiness as he is seen as a god in the DBD community.
---
It's more being in love with *spite*.
---
Ive been banned for "griefing" before so Its a legit thing, but never seen the ban longer than 7 days
---
AHHHH. That makes a ton more sense. Thank you!
---
IF YOU ALREADY HAD LF ITS A BETTER DEAL THAN USING IRI SHARDS ON IT YOU SHOULD SAVE THEM FOR SHIRTLESS MYERS
---
But when Myers is at tier I, you never see it coming!
---
*^^feets ^^don't ^^fail ^^me ^^now*
---
lol survivors out here trying to be victims already
---
The entity grabs the gens so you have to find hatch.
---
that's true almost always. If you're the last person alive and there's more than 1 gen left, find the hatch.
---
entity when the doors are opened 
---
“Now... Sashay Away.”
---
I imagine they’re going to make it so that bloodwarden pauses the timer. I thought this might be a stealth buff to the pig but then I saw they added features that would stop the clock and instantly that hope was dashed.
---
They’ll probably add the last survivor being able to open the hatch back up to that perk
---
I love it.
---
Hopefully this is just for the PTB and they realize it isn’t the most well thought out change.
---
Ok, I can definitely see that perspective. If they want to force a chase, then let's run it. It's more fun for sure. However, forcing a survivor to sit at a gen while the killer camps the hatch isn't forcing a chase either. I think a solution would have been to eliminate hatch grabs when a survivor jumps in. This forces the killer to close the hatch and begin the endgame rather than wait for the survivor to show up or complete gens revealing their location.
---
"Is this an out of season April fools joke?"
---
Becouse it makes it easy to """"win"""" conversations when you have no actual facts to support what you are saying or to attack someone else opinion without having to think about something smart to say
---
This looks great! In all honesty, I think this is gonna change the very way the game plays. Imagine watching older DBD videos and noticing the DRASTIC difference between the end-games. Plus, being able to open exit gates, the blocking factor, new animations...this looks like a new game mode, not the game itself, but it's here! Devs are outdoing themselves.
---
fucking lol you all are bending over backwards to be victims
---
^We ^can't ^pallet ^vacuum ^anymore, ^killers ^get ^*all* ^the ^breaks ^;-;
---
You'll wish they hadn't fucked with Legion when you meet my Hillbilly.
---
It's not so much about "salty survivor" and more about, in my eyes, if you complain about NOED then you are dumb. If I have to explain to someone why, then they are already not worth my time. Like when someone asks you to explain to them why the earth is not flat. You just walk away from that conversation.
---
After a post like this I either assume that OP is either a salty survivor, or has so little game knowledge that he actualyl thinks NOED needs to be changed because there is something wrong with it. Out of those two options, the "salty survivor" is the more respectful conclusion.
---
Also, OP goes on to say that "FINALLY" NOED might get changed(as if there was anything wrong with it for a long time), goes on to claim that "it has been a dissapointment", implying how this game is so strong that it ruins games, then goes on to say that he "refuses to use it out of dignity". Ye, sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
---
Guess what, I'm a killer main and I'm never using NOED? Why? Cause it's actually a bad perk. If you have to ask why, maybe think about it a little bit.
---
Yikes
---
I think that's kind of the point though. This isn't meant to screw over the normal player. This is meant to help killers when they get matched with that SWF group that refuses to leave and just urban immersions around the map, as well as finally fix the damn hatch standoff that just wastes everyone's time
---
Sorry not everyone’s salty they lost and reports for griefing daily
---
A very cool change. Maybe now people will actually leave instead of holding me hostage because I was outplayed and they want to teabag.

---
Yes, if you hit someone with the Endurance effect they now shine. The same happens for BT.
---
Actually, what I was thinking instead of reworking noed doing something like the timer progresses x% slower the more downed survivors. If three people are hooked due to noed you still have enough time to make some (risky) decisions but still at least make an attempt at saving.
---
Yeah depending on how the game goes, killers kinda just wanna go next already. But no, the 3 browntown Claudettes wanna teabag the gate and click their flashlights furiously..
---
Whoa, is there a glitch to get 5 survivors in a game instead of 4 survivors 1 killer?
---
don't act like anyone ran it anyway lmfao
---
This shit is dumb as fuck.
---
Yep. I can’t seem to join any games.
---
Just DC /s
---
I hadn't considered that... friendly auntie Nursie opening the door for her dear new survivor friends to be on their way ~~before revealing she has NOED, LET'S SEE WHO GETS TO LIVE CHILDREN~~
---
No one escapes Thor.
---
The greatest redemption arc of all time
---
Time to invest in Wake Up.
---
Yeah this isn't meant to apply to every game. In games where the endgame isn't problematic of course it won't have a big impact.
---
This, to me, is going to mostly apply to games where people stick around for no reason other than because they want to or are busy being immersed instead of trying to escape.
---
Oh, great, so people now have another reason to let survs die on the hook at the end of the game? I meant okay, it's interesting, but as far as I can see, if I'm chased and the last gen is done and the exit opened (thanks to me keeping the killer busy), if I get downed no one will ever come to rescue me knowing he has to do everything in 3min (+the time the timer slows)
---
https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1118910098267672576?s=09
---
Looks like they can't be grabbed mid jump
---
Why can’t you just let people enjoy things? Do you think you’re cool for belittling others?
---
Don't play with my heart like that
---
Favorite game of all time
---
Errrrgh I think you’ll find it’s the other way around dude.
---
He’s still crazy stabby stabby,  he just can’t rely solely on his ability to down people now.
---
Look for an IRL Claudette and make one, then.
---
Difference is legion didn’t take skill. Nurse does.  Regardless of that people seem to think he’ll never be tweaked again and that this is how he’ll be. Legion was so badly designed he’ll need many changes fix it not just these ones. These are most likely just a starting point.
---
The thing is: there's a rumour Pig is gonna be nerfed endgame-wisely
---
...that is between both these doors so you can't cleanse it !
---
I read this in a stern and but caring voice, like someone getting into trouble for stealing lol
---
yeah I was confused about that too. the timer starts right as the last gen pops in one clip which is confusing/wrong.
---
 Maybe that clip is old from when they were testing what the best point for the timer to start would be.
---
I mean hes a typical toxic survivor main what do you expect?
---
What about the “playing Freddy at rank 1” meme?
---
Agreed, though I sometimes run it on low-tier killers because they honestly need the leg up. I laugh really hard when an entitled crybaby survivor main cries foul that I used NOED on Freddy/Trapper/Wraith. They just outed themselves admitting they want ezmode.
---
yeah and all the brush tips etc that you have to draw with 😍
---
As a Pig main, I am STOKED. My RBTs are on a new level.
---
Yes, and i queried why would they ever allow that to happen. Did you actually read my inital comment?
---
Looks like survivors can't be grabbed mid jump
---
Could you please just stop annoying my joke? It's trying to do its best
---
i'm not sure i completely agree with everything you said, but i absolutely respect the manner in which you communicated it.
---
Cheers!
---
Well, that's depressing
---
Remember that perks like Poised exist now. Doing a gen as the last survivor isn't really a death sentence like it used to be.
---
Timer slows when downed or hooked, so it's likely longer than 3 minutes so it wouldn't actually line up perfectly. Still would be cool though
---
woo as a killer main idk why I’m happy but I am
---
Not gonna lie, that made me laugh. However, for every killer that gets nerfed into oblivion, you're going to get more Nurses/Billys.
---
Because how it is now is complete ass for killers
---
RACIST GAMERS ARE GARBAGE PEOPLE
---
If he's been playing for 1,5k hours, he'd have been playing since the days where just clicking on someone's profile opened that menu up, or at least would have played during one of the numerous hacker spikes where the menu was available, it takes some improbable coincidence or willing ignoring of the report function to an extreme extent to not notice the image.
---
As for your very \*spicy\* comment, I'll mark it down as mild.
---
Lmfao. Good shit man. Take my upvote.
---
Plus they don’t get their chase points
---
If all four survivors are in the basement that’s a huge misplay on their part. 
---
If one guy is on the hook at EGC, and the killer is blocking the stairs, leave that guy behind and run.
---
Noted.
---
Thank you for your honesty.
---
Wut
---
Killers can close the hatch
---
Then why are they're releasing killers along with new perks that are intended to slow down the game?
---
It can be based on placement. 
---
But there are already instances in the current game where you would have to hide from the killer while still attempting to open the gates. 
---
I'm really interested to see how the overall gameplay changes with the timer. For me, once the gates are powered I feel safer. And once the gates are open, I feel invincible. I'm excited.
---
Forever.
---
Good memories...
---
It's counter is not being greedy for stuns and dropping the pallet a half second early.
---
Like what?
---
Yes. The hatch still spawns if there are more gens done than survivors remaining, but it also spawns if there is only one survivor remaining, even if there are 0-1 gens done.
---
Pretty much this. So many people consider the hatch a free escape that they "deserve," and so many players are salty that they might have to actually earn the escape as the last one left.
---
That's just boring.
---
I really like the idea of being able to walk on any surface in the trial. I just feel that this killer could be easily gen rushed and lacks an overall ability to apply pressure.
---
I think you got brain rot bro 
---
Get well soon 😓👊
---
That's called knowing your game mechanics.  Any survivor that's been playing a while should know how much more time they have in a loop at all times.  You just need to start paying more attention to timings.
---
What perk is this? And where can I get it?
---
Digging everything except hatch closures.
---
How can an offering be toxic? Or do we just use that word for everything we don't like?
---
the good thing about running overcharge on freddy is going through the dream transition the thing about the dream transition is its good for mindgames you just need the proper timing in order to properly use it to mindgame when you fade in and out of invisibility.
---
about 17 childishness
---
And you can probably use it in a 1v1 if the killer closes it
---
Pretty sure that's why the killer can open the exit gate at ANY TIME. at least that's how it looks in the video 36 seconds in.
---
ikr
---
Has anyone told you “JuST UsE wHiSPerS!”, because I keep getting recommended that garbage perk. Apparently some killers use it just in case they come across a griefer. 
---
I am glad these changes are coming, it will allow us to fight back against toxic survivors.
---
I wonder how that endgame timer compares to the length of blood warden
---
FAIR ENOUGH!
---
How does this change hatch stand offs if the killer didn't get to the hatch first?
---
If a survivor finds the hatch while being chased by the killer, the survivor cannot just jump without risking being grabbed. The killer meanwhile cannot hit the survivor without almost guaranteeing the survivor will then slip into the hatch.
---
If the killer can close the hatch immediately the survivor is doomed. If the survivor standing on the hatch blocks it from being closed the hatch standoff still occurs.
---
Is this a alternative game mode or part of the ranked one? (Can't watch the video due to wi-fi!)
---
My ping is always good, I’m not talking about my internet I’m talking about when the killer lags. Like I said, the killer will always respond with “I know my internet is bad”
---
Twas my pleasure good sir.
---
Killers aren't any better than survivors as far as wanting "fair" games.
---
*Screams out of fear of the unknown*
---
LEGION CAN SUCK MY BROKEN KEY.
---
breaking news: blood warden become top tier perk
---
Hey now, there's no room for logic on this sub!
---
It's been a running joke of the internet since the 7th generation's console war, I can't hold it against you though, you have a running theme of missing shit that's in plain sight.
---
I'm so ready for this PTB! This is a real PTB in my opinion. A lot of changes with Legion, a new mechanic, collapse, gets introduced and a lot of perk reviews!
---
Oh no, you have to actually do the objective what a shame
---
ITS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO HEAL AGAINST SOME KILLERS LIKE LEGION. IT ENDS UP BEING A WASTE OF TIME
---
I only do so if the killer is nearby as I’m opening s gate or running out. If I don’t hear a terror radius I GTFO
---
edgy
---
I remember being able to close hatch on the Clown PTB.
---
Stomping the hatch in a Claudette's face was the best feeling I've ever had in this game.
---
Oh wow good call
---
Seems fitting that they buff at least 1 Quentin perk with the Freddy rework
---
this is the coolest thing
---
Maybe a hook rescue after the gates are powered? Like it gives more points for that since it's more bold to get someone instead of leaving.
---
I'm excited. Now, about them hitboxes.
---
Probably a dev command to make the clip.
---
I see, what would you do though? I tried to add some add ons to help apply a little pressure, theres also a lot of things that can reveal survivors auras, making them always scared lol, and eyes of the entity is what i think really helps apply pressure from saving your teamates.
---
Both of those are really good suggestions, both as strategy and something the devs could do if there is abuse of it.
---
I'm also thinking this scenario probably won't happen a lot. Most killers will close it and take their chances at the exit gates but it'd be nice if there are options if it does happen.
---
By playing well as one of a few killers.
---
If you just want to play Spirit and don't want to run NoED you're just boned.
---
&gt;Open the gate
---
&gt;Activate NOED
---
&gt;Run fast, eat ass.
---
Collapse only triggers once the gate is opened. Just leave. “What if the Killer opens the gate?” Why would the Killer ever open the gate when they’re already running NOED? Unless it’s been five minutes and he legit can’t find you. In which case just slowly make your way to the door and leave. He’s already proven he can’t find you.
---
Have you looked at any of the wraiths perks? Lol
---
Yeah but if the killer is ending the game at 4 gens, now nobody is getting any points or pips and the game is a basically a complete waste of time. Being able to end the game before the gens are done makes no sense to me.
---
Also i forgot about this one, the Shock applies heavy pressure into saving your teamates in a much faster way if you think about it, like lets say you shock someone and they are right next to a hook, thats a garuntee struggle state within 15 seconds, thats some high quality presure lmao
---
This basically sounds awful.  Another remedy that is likely worse that the disease....
---
When will BHVR learn to stop pandering their game and vision to a demographic that wants DbD to not be DbD......
---
Keep making all these awful changes for people who won't even play the game for long anyway.
---
I forgot about him lol
---
Does it? I wasn’t aware of this, didn’t hear it in the video I guess.
---
Oh really ? Didnt know that, I thought they didnt come only if you touched a gen
---
Can you please give everyone at the studio a huge thanks for this awesome change to the end game, it is literally everything I've wanted for a race to escape the end. Keep up the great work!
---
Legion being loopable outside of FF was a major complaint, don’t pretend like it wasn’t. 
---
“Statistics are silly because I think this” yeah not a stellar argument or one I can respond to. The fact of the matter is they have information that you don’t whether that be about disconnects or in-game stats.
---
Wait for the ptb. You don’t know how it is, and that’s what frustrates me about these ridiculous outraged comments. No one has played with this stuff yet. If it turns out to be mega bad, you can count me in on the discussion on how to help Legion, but I’m tired of bandwagon outrage, both sides. There are ways to be helpful about it and they certainly aren’t “well looks like there’s no reason to play anymore, idiot devs” then proceeding to not give any kind of constructive feedback on what should be better and what could be fair to both sides.
---
Overreact and overrexaggerate much?
---
We can atleast make it 3.5min: 2,5min from the trap and 1min from bloodwarden. So we may atleast aply pressure to them to the point where they need to leave people to die or die themselves, you know like Saw.
---
You can get it for free now but you couldn’t in the past.
---
Really only 3 killers and 3 survivors could be purchased with shards if you played from the beginning.
---
Like I guess there are new players who just don’t wanna spend anymore money on the game.
---
The way I see it is I played since Freddy was added I got the game to play as Freddy, I bought all the other killers that came out before him and I enjoyed the game and everytime a killer was added I paid for it.
---
The new system just means for me that I won’t buy anything off the shrine again and I won’t buy characters cause they are overpriced for how much shards you can earn.
---
So the only thing left is cosmetics if I care for them or not.
---
Maybe if the shrine and such were cheaper I’d understand but as it is now it’s just a waste when you can just spend money and actually use the cosmetics to buy the stupid shit in game (cosmetics)
---
So you’re saying I can get more points. K thanks
---
r/fridaythe13ththegame will have a field day
---
lmfao yeah because the killer is going to just know where everyone is and immersed players will be helpless :((((((((((((((
---
I remember them talking about a closing the hatch feature, but they said they never really figured it out.
---
 
---
Guess the madlads actually did it.
---
the biggest counter to her is stealth a good build against her would be spine chill, urban evasion, iron will, self care
---
Meh, it’s not a one way thing by any means. There’s idiots on both ends of the spectrum.
---
powered
---
I'm more curious about how Blood Warden and whether or not it forestalls this timer.
---
Imagine playing Piggy with Blood Warden now. Absolutely delightful.
---
Easily the better smash though
---
&gt; I don't want to run a meta build but I want to be able to effortlessly counter meta builds with any old playstyle
---
Fucking lol
---
Time to run blood warden on trapper/pig
---
Play another game.
---
The endgame is addressed. How 'bout bodyblocking toxic killers bodyblocking survivors and holding the game hostage? Granted the game can't be held hostage now if another survivor triggers the collapse, but I've seen instances where the remaining survivors are trapped by a basement bodyblock.
---
I have a suggestion for BHVR to take into consideration. Delayed hitboxes. They won't initially be able to just go through the killer, but if they kept trying to move in that general direction for, say, 3 seconds, they phase through. The only thing it'd disrupt is the Shape feeding off of trapped survivors.
---
"fixed a bug where the killer was able to win"
---
I'd like to see #1 be like a Halo animation where they punch the switch to force it open.
---
In trappers case it’s more or less a guaranteed win, especially with certain addons.
---
I mean that goes both ways though doesn't it? The killer didn't really earn the kill he just found the hatch first and closed it, also now the killer can just wait at the hatch for a survivor to either repair a gen or try to take hatch, close it, then know exactly where they are and kill them.
---
He can only hit one of you, time to pull straws. :)
---
Hold on, what's this end game collapse?
---
I’m all for this except the part where the killer csn open the gates. That seems like really bad design.
---
Trapper does a backflip then tombstones the survivor into a bear trap cutting decapitating them in the process
---
Let's get a Ru Ru Ru spam in the comments, please.
---
 You bringing up Trapper made me think, what's stopping him from closing the hatch and trapping the gates? It would be over at that point especially if he has bloody coil and/or iridescent stone
---
I'm absolutely horrified to think how long healing and Mending will take with Iridescent Button + Dirty Blade + Coulrophobia + Sloppy Butcher + Thanataphobia if it indeed applied the Terrir Radius map wide the whole game. 
---
Iridescent Button + Unnerving Presence + Hex: Ruin is going to destroy low ranks though.
---
Legionairres disease.
---
I mean its literally just denying items, its pointless and petty from the killer honestly, it doesnt give them anything
---
Can legion trade addons to other killer? Doc wants it
---
Anything from a chest is generally shit, stuff brought in is what you worry about
---
Yall really think survivors aren't gonna wait until just before the timer ends? They'll just run around the gates, leaping over shit until you eventually whack their asses out.
---
The only things that gonna really change in this update is the hatch stand off.
---
idk why you’d ask a question and then get pissed at me dude. yeah, it’s cheap, but what HASNT been cheap in this game
---
I want more entity. It would be nice if he plagued the sides of some structures to let everyone know he’s watching. If they ever make another legacy I’d also like the killers to have the entity latched onto them.
---
Care to make a friendly wager on that?   I do ever so love getting to tell people "I told you so."
---
All killers are loopable even at 115 movement speed. This doesnt change that. M
---
You're giving the devs the benefit of the doubt but I dont think they deserve it at this point since they pushed out the ash update without clearly testing whether or not mettle of man would be OP. And guess what? I wouldnt run survivor without it because it's a free health state that has won me games easily because it's not rare to get hit 3 times.
---
Even had a silly moment where the perk activated o  plague corrupt purge even though it really shouldnt have. 
---
It's clear they dont know what they are doing for survivor and killer balance so why would you just trust them based on statistics that they will not release? Why defend bad decisions? The sounds are messed up again at the moment and they seem to have buffed pallet spawns again for some reason as there are crazy good defensive setups that have been showing up.
---
Shape has no collision while stalking.
---
But no, as this would make the intentionally blockable basement pointless. Body blocking active RBTs and BT timers are both valid tactics that require more than 3 seconds.
---
So dedicating 2 perks means the killer Should get free hits when they get stunned, wow you are smart
---
Mind expanding on that? I can't really see the utility of his power now besides just getting a single hit if he's slower, his power takes longer to activate, he can't use it in chases, he can't use it to pressure survivors, and he'll lose a chase if he uses it for vaults. Once again, if there's something obvious I'm missing, I'd love to be made aware of it.
---
I'm imagining NOED, Speedy Carry, Iron Grasp, and Insidious. Go open a gate, smap a survivor, carry them all the way to the basement, then wait.
---
Well that takes care of toxic survivors T baggin the exit gate or hatch 
---
Now what will they do about the face camping killers
---
no no no no, THIS is me :)
---
Do gens.
---
Down a survivor &gt; open gate &gt; hook him &gt; bloodwarden prok &gt; survivors confused sreamimg
---
It could be beneficial for certain endgame killer builds. For instance, Piggy would benefit from doing this if she’s put some RBTs on survivors, as they can’t leave through the exit gate with the RBT on but they only have 3 minutes to search through Jigsaw Boxes. Piggy just patrols the boxes and secures some fairly easy kills this way.
---
Additionally, perks like Blood Warden and NOED could allow the killer to apply serious pressure this way. Killer opens the gate, NOED activates, killer downs one survivor and hooks them, Blood Warden activates, now the killer can find the other survivors to down them with NOED without needing to worry about the survivors escaping.
---
And of course insta-down killers could use it for cheese, camping at the open gate for cheeky kills (I see some exit gate Bubba builds coming in the future).
---
See you just said if you can, but if its not possible to flip it early the killer gets the underserved hit
---
Entity is spider confirmed
---
What? End game collapse happens when a gate is open. Why would you go for the hatch if you have a clear path to the gate?
---
So hatch will now only spawn when 1 survivor is left? So keys are now pretty much only useful during the collapse?
---
I dont give a shit what you think
---
Yep, I never go to the gates Ill just wander around breaking pallets, wait for them to leave.
---
I agree with this statement. I understand the need to Nerf legion but they went to far and way too many at once. I hope that they really read feedback on the next ptb. It wad funny still lol
---
Its uncounterable and cheap and just op
---
Na, that's tombstone
---
This is really really great and helps solves one of the worst problems with this game. As killer, I've had too many games where I spent too much time looking for that last survivor. It's made me not want to play.
---
But what I'd love is for this to potentially be implemented at the start of the game: The end game collapse triggers if for five minutes if a gen was not done. (Or something like that.)
---
I feel like this would force survivors to be much more active and create this tension from the beginning. Yes, five minutes would almost never make it trigger, but the "worst" part of Dead By Daylight is that the game doesn't come to a conclusion without player momentum. If survivors are forced to do stuff otherwise they die, I think that just fixes and helps much of the game design.
---
It worked that way with the addon before
---
Only difference is now the terror radius will affect the entire map whether you hit someone or not
---
And people wonder why all the survivor mains have quit, this place is such a killer circle jerk its hilarious.
---
No release date. Is this already on the PTR? I just looked, and I couldn't find it in the Steam options. :/
---
It'll start the end game collapse and force the survivors out of hiding. Additionally, depending on how they implement it, it may also trigger perks like Rancor and NOED...
---
It also happens when the hatch gets closed
---
unnerving isn't even really an issue unless its combo'd with overcharge or a high stack huntress' lullaby
---
So the gates would be powered.
---
Not gonna bother arguing with a guy who puts my entire opinion into my mouth before I even had the chance to say what I think about the perk. But next time you do that, please don't spread misinformation like that. DS does not make you the obsession anymore until after you use it.
---
I merely said there was some clear counterplay to the perk in that given situation, and I stand by that point. Nothing I said in my previous comment was about whether MoM was fair or not
---
To quote Dr. Strange: "We're in the end game now."
---
Let's cross out the obvious: woo boy no more cunt Claudettes holding my game hostage for half a fucking hour just to BM me in the post game chat!
---
The ability to close the hatch is very, *very* nice I will admit. I'm happy that you've finally returned to that concept. I do think that it might be a bit too oppressive to force Survivors to open the gates during that time though.
---
This suddenly makes a lot of Killers a lot stronger, as well as a lot of perks. The most notable perk is Bloodwarden which you can now use knowing that the gates are in-fact open, and can potentially get a lot more Kills with.
---
This is also a HUGE buff for Pig. If anyone has a trap on their head they're going to have two ticking timers to escape. Now you can actually chase the Survivor with a bear trap and still have them die when the end game happens. Add in the fact that you can close the hatch and suddenly Pig goes from B tier to at least a solid B+.
---
I think this is a very good idea that fits thematically and also helps fix the more boring parts of the game. Overall I'm just overjoyed that we won't have to deal with fucking hatch standoffs anymore.
---
Be Oink Mistress.
---
Open the gates and set 2 people’s helmets to beeping.
---
Blood Warden someone and lock the beepers inside.
---
Close the hatch.
---
fuck.jpg
---
You just made me tear up with that picture, fucking nostalgia 😭
---
Well if you look at the video they look about the same color so we'll see.
---
People roleplay their characters outside of the game, even if not consciously. What we see here is teabagging or whacking a hooked survivor, but hours after the last match was actually played and with shittier graphics.
---
Well, Stab wound study could stay the exact same
---
Even get a buff
---
Frank's might just allow stabs to hurt the bar to begin with instead of increasing the amount it does
---
Not if you have to open one of them while the killer is camping both gates.
---
It doesn't invalidate anything. The question was how to invalidate MoM, for which there are several options. 
---
The simplest solution available to every killer: don't let them heal 3 times. Down them when you hit them, don't let them run off and spend half a minute sitting in one spot healing. If you down and hook them each time, they're dead before they ever get a third heal.
---
Alternatively, run a killer capable of a one shot and lean on that late game, or just accept that a perk cost you 4 whole seconds of chase and hit them again. Implying that every survivor perk should be easily countered by every killer playstyle makes you sound ignorant.
---
If it's the last survivor the hatch spawns regardless of the gens done in the new update
---
Sometimes when I'm watching someone play dbd I just sit back and listen to the in game music, the chase, terror radius, every song in DBD is amazing, the end game isn't different
---
Dude,there's a lot of undeserved things in this game. A pallet not stunning a killer is by far not the most serious.
---
Actually they change it depending on feedback so for all you know a lot of people might not like it either so don't assume things like that. I said block whoever is trolling you if you don't like what they're doing and think they're toxic players it's really simple and takes 5 seconds would you like an instruction manual? I'm on xbox blocking does wonders because then you don't have to play with them again instead of trying to change the way the game works. Of course I'm gonna disagree with an update where the killer can get free sacrifice points for doing nothing at all because a timer ran out on top of having the bigger benefit in the last 3 minutes.
---
Honestly all killers should get more mori’s. I don’t understand how they don’t understand that this community would be more then willing to pay for more mori’s
---
Been playing the game for a month and a half or so and have only ever disconnected 3 times total, all as survivor.  Not proud of them, but I try not to as much as possible because I know it ruins the game.  
---
Occasionally if I’m already in a bad mood my frustrations will get the best of me, but usually I try to think of the fact that I’ll be dead soon anyways and will move on to the next game.  
---
On the other hand, my girlfriend just disconnects whenever she’s mildly inconvenienced sometimes and it really annoys me.  One game she left right away after I used my only purple flashlight and blood party streamers and she didn’t realize.
---
Clearly, people who can’t give concise points and instead insult other people when given a challenge tend to not have the mental capacity to   give a shit.
---
All I’ll say is this... Watch killer mains still find a reason to bitch about something in the months to come. No killer main will upvote this
---
I main survivor almost exclusively, lol
---
Theyve actually predicted survivors 99ing the exit gates and not starting the timer. the killer can open the gate mostly for that reason  think
---
Then you go to the hatch. The example given was a single survivor.
---
You can just hit them out the door.
---
Instead of facecamping a hook, killers can guarantee a kill by camping a corner with a survivor. 
---
See: Hag with Scarred Hand, Trapper with Stitched Bag, Wraith period, Clown with Girth
---
I can’t wait to get penetrated by the entity.
---
The killer can close the hatch and then camp the exit gates.
---
Why the hell would you stay on that side of the pallet instead of looping it from the long side?
---
Not really
---
Might've been just a presentation trailer video thing.
---
NOED activates before a gate is open, collapse only starts *after* so you have, ostensibly, infinite time to cleanse NOED unless someone opens a gate.
---
&gt; If you could just pop them whenever then you could just use noed and potentially bitter murmur on a high mobility killer and go for it.
---
gens don't get completed, they get blocked
---
Dedicating two perks means you should get punished if you don't adjust your play style accordingly.
---
You're the only one complaining about it being "a free hit". From the killer's side they've had to deal with 2 pallets already and get lucky that the idiot survivor went for the stun on the 3rd. 
---
It's no more of a free hit than Bamboozling a window and catching a survivor trying to go back through it, or downing someone at a Bloodwarden'd exit gate they couldn't go through.  In all scenarios the killer had to devote either time and resources to making it happen.
---
And if you want to get technical and fling insults, you're getting hit after they recover from the stun you brainlet. Unless you're referring to getting hit mid-pallet drop in which case Spirit Fury wouldn't matter anyway. 
---
This entire thread is a shrine to the whining of a survivor who refuses to adapt to a killer's perks, instead wishing the game never surprised them with anything new because it's too hard to change.
---
It will very rarely kill survivors. Like reverse beartraps its just a threat of what can happen. 
---
Survivors will still sit at the exits until right before the timer, this will punish immersed players though
---
I don't think this is a bad thing. Some killers (Fredberg, Amanda) are more geared towards the endgame currently, and are really REALLY bad because of it. This will definitely make them more viable, and maybe even top tier (as far as m1 killers go). Keep in mind, Amanda has to actually catch everyone to put rbts on them. The odds of having a 4 stack all trapped is very low. 
---
It will also diversify builds on other m1 killers. They can either choose to apply early/mid game pressure with the current standard enduring fury build, or prepare for the late/endgame. 3 gen builds, blood warden builds, and basement builds all suddenly become viable options for killing. For pipping, I'm not so sure. 
---
I am worried about noed though, but what else is new?
---
What if they pulling a negotiation tactic with the community. Where they ask for too much so that we refuse then the present something they actually want and it seems more reasonable.
---
Damn you are right. 
---
It's for the "When you start a game as a killer and your mom calls for dinner" situation haha
---
DS doesn't make *you* the obsession, but if somebody in the trial is running DS then *somebody* will become the obsession.
---
oh right. well at least it works with unnerving presence now I guess.
---
How are people getting two killers? I don't understand.
---
fear not the fat, it embraces all
---
then why ask reddit?
---
2.6 was a huge buff to survivors with the added pallets, and now mettle of man.
---
I mean its  kinda establishing that if the killer closes the hatch they pretty much win, I think they should definitely remove hatch grabs as they are glitchy enough as is but killer winning 99% of the time they close the hatch is fine
---
Don’t be what guy?
---
HAHA I live for this
---
Which is completely irrelevant to your point because for that to happen it would require no one to have MoM
---
Only if you're nurse is that true. Half or more of the killers aren't even viable in high ranks, a fact the devs have openly admitted they're OK with
---
Specifically ignoring everything to chase one survivor to death, constantly going back to the hook/proxy camping and chasing off hook also
---
So many pebbles will be thrown!
---
Hatch still spawns normally. So you can only close it if there is only 1 guy left alive, or someone used a key and escaped through the hatch (if you grab them out of the key escape then the hatch closes down again and it doesn't consume the key).
---
The hatch doesn't just stay open all game.
---
The pig with her reverse bear trap would be deadly on the right map and entity collapse.
---
i don't get it. what changed?
---
This also stops bullshit like survivors being able to 99% the gate to deny Blood Warden. The killer can fix that now.
---
I don't think you thought this through. If the Killer closes the hatch you now have less than 3 minutes to open the exit gates. If you played passive until there was no one left then you would HAVE to find the hatch before the killer does OR after the Killer closes the hatch you now must open the exit gates since there is no other way to leave.  
---
It is a survivor nerf through and through. The logical gymnastics you'd have to participate in to believe otherwise is incredible.
---
This looks brutal.
---
I feel you guys are forgetting about the part where pallets get broken just by vaulting them. Without the Deep Wound condition this could prove to be insane.
---
Bubba is worthy
---
Za Warudo
---
Wait you can open the exit gates before the gens are done? i don't think it's going to work like that. and what do you mean  you can see all survivors? is there  boosted aura reading during end game?
---
Ooooh, I like the idea of tying NOED to the collapse.
---
Yeah but surely you’d still want to do all the damage you could before endgame. It’s not like opening the gates makes endgame longer
---
Why don't they get their points?
---
Imagine playing spookie and hooking someone down the basement and then waiting above invisible till they go downstairs for the save and then bodyblock the exit for 3 mins.
---
Congrats: Legion requires an Ultra Rare to be a worse Billy.
---
I will admit the ability to be Doctor on steroids (with Unnerving and Down2ClownPhobia and the likes) is... interesting.
---
The part where it twists them and snaps their spine sent chills down mine.
---
Yeah, looks like the entity giving survivors the finger.
---
Well since one of the Dev's confirmed on Twitter grabbing survivors mid hatch jump won't be an option anymore I imagine we'll see more hatch t-bags
---
Very true okay that makes a lot of sense. and it's not really op because hooked and downed survivors slow the timer. BUT what would work really good is if that guy is dead on hook lol
---
Hes been getting reworked since he was released.
---
Idk my current 4k strike is pretty fun ngl
---
A gate takes 20 seconds to open. You have from the moment the last Survivor dies until the Killer closes the hatch to find a gate. If you *can't* get a gate open in 3 minutes stop playing, you suck.
---
Yeah pig is getting a serious buff by being able to open the exit gates. very interesting we'll see how this turns out
---
Same here buddy
---
You could just as easily basement hook someone and then block the doorway into the basement. I do it when I'm feeling toxic.
---
Thing is, the devs intended this change, so it needs a nerf
---
I dont think it will impact as much as people think in terms of survivors powering the gates, it definitely shakes up the hatch though
---
Unless the hatch also spawns right next to the two exit gates, the lone survivor opens the gates while the killer is off closing the hatch.
---
Everyone gets sacrificed by the entity
---
Yeah that makes sense. Good thing end game piggy is one of the builds i use most on killer side :-)
---
Nope, i dont give a shkt because i dont care about you
---
Regardless of whether its a smart idea as the killer or not (I can definitely see insidious camping still being a thing here)  it is still a thing, and doing gens is the best way to force the killers hand.
---
Im not trying to suggest that the perk is remotely good, just that it isn't entirely useless.
---
Not gonna lie, I was not into the Legion "rework" but the end game colapse looks cool af. The entity now can show that it's in fact there and it looks spooky when it impales.
---
I hope you are right. Maybe the PTB will fix some issues. 
---
I understand what you are saying about the skill level required to be OP, but OP is still OP. (I would also say practice more than skill) The only reason she isn’t getting nurfed is because there are not a bunch of people playing her in the key demographic. I guarantee you if massive amounts of killers in the 8-15 ranks started to main her, there would be a massive amount of complaints and she would be the next one to get the deep wound treatment. Not saying I want that, just saying Legion’s OP-ness was more of an annoyance because more people used her. 
---
No one wants to go against Nurse after Nurse. That is one of the big complaints survivors in red ranks have.
---
This video is a perfect example of when you should stop mind-gaming or break off and go after someone else. 
---
If the killer had just committed to and eaten the pallet, he would have needed up with at least 1 sacrifice. 
---
If he had broken off the chase, or chased the survivor to other areas, it would have been a completely different game.
---
That being said, I felt the anger this killer must have had for you. Ggwp.
---
Even as a survivor main I love the Endgame Collapse. Matches turning into a "who can find the hatch first" was never very fun. This looks like it could change up how games play out significantly.
---
Good question. In the video it seems they went from 4 gens left to find the exit. I was under the impression the idea was once all gens are done, the killer could manually open the gate to start the countdown, so NOED would have been active anyways. 
---
Then I thought "maybe he closed the hatch" but all survivors were alive, so maybe it IS actually possible to open the gate right off the bat. I mean the devs did say a while back they wanted to add a way for the killer to "surrender" or concede, (and I think in a way that fit in-universe, compared to the round instantly ending with a "KILLER HAS FORFEIT MATCH" message) if a match isn't going so well, and opening the gate to manually skip to endgame and end the round in a minimum of 3 minutes sounds like a decent way to do that and just get things over with. 
---
I do agree though about the pipping concern. I never even thought about it until now. There should be a compensation for anything not done so if a killer decides to end the match really early for whatever reason survivors won't depip because no gens could have been done. 
---
Maybe it was just for demonstration purposes. I imagine it will be tweaked and looked at.
---
To see how dumb these killer mains are, LMAO
---
Oh look, it's the map that made me stop playing cod zombies. I should go play it to see if it's as bad as I remember
---
&gt;automatic hatch spawn at 5 gens
---
Every killer slugs at purple ranks and below so it's not like that means anything
---
*Shrimp lift noises*
---
First, what's this "less" stuff? You get 3 minutes after the hatch closes to GTFO. That's 9x longer than it takes to open a gate. Seriously, if you can't do that, quit. You're trash at the game.
---
As nice as the new entity animation looks, this is just another way to give killers free sacrifices they didn’t earn. If the kill didn’t count as a sacrifice this could be fine, but they’re not putting the person on the hook. The entity had to come and do it on their own. 🤦🏿‍♀️
---
"You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist." \~ Friedrich Nietzsche - Thus Spoke Zarathustra
---
Especially now that the hatch spawns regardless of completed gens. Anyone that hides the entire game until their 3 teammates are dead reaches the end game, yet that’s the player that “deserves” an escape the least.
---
I was wondering when someone would post it.
---
I don’t get how it works when only one survivor is left ?
---
I mean that makes sense it's just the only reason a killer will open it is to say "Gtfo of here" like if they 99 it, the killer can open it and theyll just run out. I guess it's more of a fail-safe rather than something to cause actual pressure in the end game (except for pig)
---
After the mid chapter update killers can close the hatch. And once they do a timer starts and if the survivor doesn’t get out in time the entity kills them.
---
You can't just make a funny post AND beat me to making that comment. Stop tunneling all the karma man
---
Unfortunately yes it is right now. There are matchmaking issues being worked on. Good news is that you cannot drop in rank until you get to 17. Just try to push through.
---
I don't really like the red veins effect on the ground.
---
 I feel like it will mess up with reading scratch marks too much.
---
Coolest than yours
---
Well we don't know how endgame perks will work yet.
---
1. Yeah, it does. Every survivor having an extra health means you're all but guaranteed to lose.
---
2. That doesn't work unless you have an instadown or they go full potato and let you grab them. Even if you don't let them heal a single time they'd get MoM to proc before they died (assuming they didn't get put into struggle on their first hook) since it takes two hits to down the first time, then a third to down them the second time, so it'd be ready the moment they came off the hook for the third time.
---
3. "Play a better killer" isn't a valid argument. We shouldn't be forced into playing Nurse/Billy/Huntress every game when we paid for a game that has 15 killlers and counting.
---
4. If you honestly think that an extra health state only buys a survivor 4 seconds, I find it hard to believe you have DBD installed. Even if you just hold shift and W you'll buy yourself 20 seconds. The only time MoM would buy you "4 seconds" is if you're either AFK or going full potato against Huntress (who gave you MoM for some reason).
---
MoM is just as bad as DS was.
---
I do have to admit that it looks very visually impressive. I'm really excited to try out some late game builds with Pig and have a really cinematic "Game Over" with a bunch of people deseprately searching for Bear Trap keys just to get stabbed by the entity.
---
I'm excited to see fan art of the End Game collapse.
---
Pick your poison
---
You can still grab a survivor if they jump into the hatch, unless they are in the dying state (just like before).
---
They just mad they didnt get to farm. . .
---
I think the a simple change of making it so that it  only activates if a survivor powers up the last gen, that way the killer has to choose between noed or a stronger position depending on the situation.
---
I'll try, lol. Thanks.
---
Okay but then survivors have 3 minutes (or whatever determinable time they use for the stand off) to open the gates as theyre being monitored by the killer... but opening the gates is supposed to trigger the collapse.. so would it reset the collapse or can the killer just keep going back and forth to force the timer to run out in maps where the gates spawn inconveniently close to each other?
---
As a killer I now see incentive to slug someone once collapse begins - people will try to make a save. If I do as some do to counter BT or the new DS - I wait until near the 2 minute mark to hook someone (with blood warden) and then the opened exits are useless - I can force them back into the map, slug those users as well and force a loss.  
---
Frankly this should count as death but not a successful sacrifice for the killer
---
A dev has said on twitter that you won't be able to grab the survivor from the hatch escape anymore.
---
I guess it's equal now, whoever gets there first wins. Doesn't matter if you are in a chase, you got to the hatch first, so you win. Either side.
---
r/boneappletea
---
Dude some gates are right by each other and with a killer like Billy you can go back and forth to them and down someone super easily. I know, I’ve done it before...
---
No it doesn't? If they intended this change then it is how it should be in their eyes? If we take away any perk that gives a killer an extra edge we need to take away survivor perks as well, not that there's a lot. Just because something *for the other side* works against you doesn't mean it NEEDS to change. Get better at not relying on pallets exclusively during chase. Use walls, Windows better. Use lerys memorial offering for that, it's a really good map to learn how to utilize that kind of thing.
---
No. It is opened.
---
Except there's no forcing by doing gens anymore. As a Survivor you get *no* benefit from popping gens in this situation. Under the old system the Killer could be drawn away from the hatch, giving you the chance to escape. Under collapse they just get a notification of your location before closing the hatch and giving you 3 minutes to GTFO and no place to go but the gates. I *have* thought this through, doing gens as the last Survivor is only detrimental to your chances.
---
r/grammarfail
---
14 15 and 16 are easy. I'm currently still stuck in green ranks on killer. I think I got into purple once. You just need to try and watch some guides and practice one killer at a time. Find one you are good with. I honestly can reccomend a few. If you have trouble keeping up play hillbilly. If you keep losing people play freddy in low ranks.
---
I like it on both sides, I like how it’ll be more intense but instead of slow like usual, coming from a survivor 60% killer 40% player
---
Can you still use a key?
---
Except it isn't, because *there is no way to tell the difference*.
---
From the killer POV there is no way of telling on game start whether the obsession is being caused by a DS or by MoM.
---
My suggestion is if you think youll be the final survivor then begin looking for the hatch pre-emptivly, or start practicing your chase/ hiding skills
---
Bodyblocking active Reverse Bear Traps? Valid?
---
That's absolutely horrible, rotten, and incredibly unfun. This is not slugging we're talking about where the game is built around it, bodyblocking the basement absolutely needs to go, Borrowed Time be damned.
---
Just drop the pallet early, once you know they have it you know to drop it before the stun. That's the counter, not to mention getting stunned isn't rewarding "bad play". Swinging through the pallet is the smart play, because if you respect the pallet, you're giving them another loop or two around it if they don't drop it. 
---
Respect women, not pallets.
---
In the video, the exit gates open while four generators still need to be finished (it’s roughly 34 seconds into the video), indicating that the killer can open the gates at any point in the match.
---
I've had hatches spawn right under me, or within a few feet. It's rare, but it happens.
---
if they address that then they need to also fix other map problems like the wretched shop and ironworks loops
---
But really why does that matter?
---
Its probably the only way they could stop the exploit. I mean im ok with it i just hope it isnt too annoying.
---
Most of my purple flashlights were found in chests, so I'm inclined to disagree. 
---
Also, a lucky flashlight find or toolbox in the late game that you didn't get a chance to run perks against can be backbreaking. It's not often, but cut coin is useful for those corner cases.
---
That is assuming you have all the gens done before the Collapse starts. 
---
And it is always going to be less than 3 minutes with only one survivor left because no one can get hooked to slow down the timer. Time always moves forward so you have less than 3 minutes to leave before you instantly lose.
---
If you cannot open an exit gate unmolested for 20 seconds then, yes, you DO suck. But that is NEVER going to be the case unless the Killer is de-pipping. 
---
They will patrol one gate then the other after the Collapse starts and if you can handle a Killer solo when they can just camp the gates for less than 3 minutes then more power to ya but it isn't going to be the norm.
---
Again, it is a Survivor nerf. Case closed.
---
Am I wrong or did they optimize in the last chapter? I haven’t played since the last chapter but I played a few games and they seemed better. If console hasn’t been optimized yet then BHVR once again lied to us.
---
You can still do the gens if he doesnt close the hatch but yea they make it basically the killer can do whatever he wants
---
This makes me think Remember Me plus dreamworld seem pretty strong. Now I'm wondering if the Freddy rework will change the perks and power accordingly. Can't wait for the reveal after this.
---
Trappers mori is super lazy looking. People say dbd is better by friday the 13th and it is content wise but the kills in that game are all unique and look nice.
---
That's some high deviousness scores on their part then lol
---
If you are the last remaining Survivor, the hatch will spawn. You can still work on generators when that happens. If the killer closes the hatch, then all the remaining generators will be powered, allowing you to open the exit gates.
---
The hatch will not re-open on its own, but you can re-open it with a key.
---
And if you're a smart Survivor you'll be at the gate when it powers. Unless you're either against a Nurse or got screwed by RNGesus putting the hatch by the gates, you can get it open. I know, I've done it before...
---
I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DEPIP BECAUSE THE KILLER DISCONNECTS.
---
Why would a killer main upvote you randomly bitching about them without any real reason?
---
6 am me is on drugs I swear
---
All quick movement killers like Nurse, Billy, and maybe spirit will generally just shut the hatch if they have line of sight on both exits. 
---
Slower killers will still hatch camp, at least until the survivor takes too long. Then they force the collapse.
---
This update isn’t to help survivors at all, let’s be real, but maybe I’ll play killer now. Especially since all I have to do is stand around and wait for the entity to just get all the kills for me. 🙃
---
Killers could just run blood warden and noed. That would suck though.
---
When two gens get done in the time it takes to do one pallet loop. 😞
---
It says the timer slows down if people are downed or hooked so it won't be as OMG powerful as it sounds.
---
I support certain reasons. Wasn’t toxic at all. Leave because the ping is terrible when you were convinced otherwise! How is that toxic? Some agree with me, some don’t. And like I stated, I knew everyone wasn’t going to be happy.  Have a good day ;)
---
Those be the devs words, not more. The basement was intentionally designed to be blockable. Period. Don't like it, don't play.
---
Me: Pleasse entity t,,he ;mean sUrvvivors  keep bullying me; i n;;eed heelp   pls  s
---
Entity: say less lmao
---
If the Survivor gets there first, they can jump in.  
---
If the Killer gets there first, they can kick it.
---
If the Survivor AND Killer get there at the same time, the Survivor can try to jump in, but the Killer can also grab them like before. Alternatively, the Killer can close the hatch before the Survivor jumps in.
---
But if the survivor is at the hatch, they won. Grabs wont be a thing anymore. Killer still loses in this situation.
---
Steal those idiots bloodpoints. Duh
---
I love the idea of the entity just feeling so bad for a killer not getting any kills that they feel the need to help out XD 
---
This comes from a bad Huntress main, I know I'm bad, this will help a bit
---
Maybe the Entity should have thought of that when he puts the fucking hatch in to begin with!
---
Spoilers: The Hatch is the Entity's booty hole.
---
I really like this. I think I actually like this to much. Kinda feels like the devs should work on big changes like this often.
---
(I really don't want end games to happen scarcly. Wonder if they would consider lowering gen times and increasing escape difficulty).
---
Probably a reward for rescuing someone on the endgame phase, I like it.
---
Yes my friend last night got disconnected 2 times mid match! From the game, not even the internet connection. I haven’t (yet) but it’s unfortunate.
---
Yeah most people figured out bloodwarden I think so I went with a different scenario.
---
not really. there's now no purpose to chasing a wounded survivor, so pallet looping with them offers no advantage. hopping a pallet in frenzy to break it is only useful to save time later on, or if the pallet happens to be on your way to another survivor.
---
&gt; what do you mean you can see all survivors? is there boosted aura reading during end game?
---
Bitter murmur shows the aura of all survivors when the last gen is done. Depending how the game handles this, it could count as them being done and show you the aura of everyone for 10 seconds.
---
YOU. I LIKE YOU.

---
And Franklin's demise. Ouch.
---
So survivors are screwed either way, they find the hatch while the killer is on their tail and they can't jump in without being grabbed, and if the killer finds it first they can just camp/bodyblock it.
---
I guess that's one way of making Left Behind viable.
---
Omfg READ THE OTHER "ARGUMENTS" everyone says just flip it early, but they know sure as shit thats not always possible, and no, getting stunned and getting a free hit isnt fair
---
The hatch closes by itself after enough time passes if opened with a key. I wonder if that would also start endgame. IMHO a killer closing the hatch opened via key (1 gen left, 3 survivors, etc.) should just close the hatch without starting endgame. Only a "Last Survivor Standing" hatch close should start endgame.
---
Well, it's not supposed to help if they're at the gate, it's just meant to keep them from staying too long, forcing them to leave is part of the point.
---
You are likely taking the turns too wide. Hug the corners and edges. Around smaller turns, survivors are just about as fast.
---
If the survivor gets to the hatch first there is no standoff if they're outside of grab distance.  If the survivor stands on it presumably the killer can kick it anyways.

---
*turns on noed*
---
I thought mending wasn't affected by coulrophobia? I'm sure they mentioned it at the same time they changed snap out of it to do the same.
---
hi this game is only horror for the first few hours you play it, get the "this game needs to be scary!" mentality out of your fucking brain, playing something for hundreds of hours is gonna lose the scare factor.
---
I would be down with this, speeding up the collapse sounds terrifying in its own right.
---
Well their eyes are right, since THEY DONT PLAY THEIR OWN GAME just look at mettle of man, so op,
---
thats not it chief
---
Honestly they would probably make a mountain of cash if they implemented a Mori shop with all sorts of cool moris.
---
&gt;And it is always going to be less than 3 minutes with only one survivor left because no one can get hooked to slow down the timer. Time always moves forward so you have less than 3 minutes to leave before you instantly lose.
---
....
---
That makes it **3 minutes.** Not less. The timer only starts if the hatch is closed or a gate is opened. It's a 3 minute timer, meaning you have **3 minutes.** This isn't complicated. Fuck, it isn't even *math* so I don't know what your comprehension problem is.
---
Are you on ps4? I might be able to help you better understand killer in a kyf lobby sometime if interested
---
this literally does nothing it just makes survivors leave the gates faster no one will ever be sacrificed unless they troll fuck this game and company they are survivor biased lying trash
---
*9K bp from deviousness category.*
---
No because I can play a game on my phone, watch a video on YouTube, pet my cat, do some dishes etc.
---
Meanwhile they waste twenty plus minutes of their time trying to waste mine.
---
So, how will keys work if the hatch only spawns with the last survivor? And how will the achievements for escaping with the hatch work if it can be just permanently removed?  This really seems to completely fuck over a bunch of core gameplay elements, lol.  Fuuck this.
---
Theres 52 comments here already. You posed a question I gave an answer. I'm sorry you didn't like it.
---
Perhaps next time don't ask if people think something is fair if you can't handle the answers they have. Have a great day!
---
Why did this make me laugh?
---
2 things
---
1 I would love to clap those hag cheeks. 
---
2 when’s this mid chap taking affect
---
Another idea, after running continuously for 10/9/8 seconds, the perk activates. When you stop running your scratch marks will continue 5/6/7 meters ahead. Tier 3 of the perk will bend the scratch marks towards the nearest interactable object.
---
This is definitely going to need a rework. Hopefully, they'll get this shit working right on the ptb.
---
Tier 3 can do this. Pretty cool, I like it.
---
3 minutes by default, slows down when someone is downed or hooked. BW blocks the exits for, at most, 1 minute. Since BW requires that someone be hooked, the effective block time will be lower.
---
Holding the game hostage is already a reportable offense
---
No :( PC
---
I don't think it's reasonable that you should have to plan your build around the chance that a survivor will have MoM. And the issue with MoM isn't in midgame chases, typically the MoM user will have it up by the time the last gen is done, which isn't that hard to force as a user of the perk, just stand in front of killers going for hooks. If you're playing a killer without an instadown, or the survivors took away your totem based instadown perks, there's no way that you will down that survivor, especially if they have adrenaline. I can't tell you how many games I've watched or played in where that's the case. 
---
True, there are options to invalidate the perk, but should killers really have to rely on ultra rare addons, perks that can be outright taken out of the game, or play hillbilly/myers every game (leatherface isn't an option c'mon lol) in order to kill one person? In what is supposed to be an asymmetric game, the answer is no in my opinion.
---
What sounds awful about it to you?
---
You just said the devs were right in their making of the perk. 
---
Look dude, you're sweaty. Stop playing if one perk gets to you that badly. There's a lot of things going wrong in this game, more that will go wrong in the future, and some amazing fixes coming as well. You aren't obligated to play if this one perk tilts you so severely. You are free to leave. 
---
Otherwise, as much as I hate saying this, get good. Get better at running killers. Learn new loop strategies. Use perks you haven't used before like lightweight or quick and quiet. Learn to play around or just don't play.
---
Seems intentional IMO. Chances of a survivor actually avoiding the killer &amp; making it to the exit gates without being tracked in the 3 minutes seems really low.  Not being able to see blood/scratch marks balances that a bit and actually gives survivors a chance to juke/lose the killer during the end game.
---
Devs: Killers have a higher winrate and lower ranks than survivors, and near equal at higher ranks.
---
Also Devs: Lets make an update that buffs killers and gives survivors a time limit to end the game.
---
He looks like the movie poster of human centipede part 2
---
That can still happen. Most of us don't want to drag out games, but you bet you'll see some killers who instead of closing the hatch will leave it open and camp it since they can now both grab and close it.
---
So you'll sometimes be stuck doing generators instead of going for the 2-exit endgame immediately.
---
It was weirdly my first thought.
---
since Freddy is getting a rework we really have no way of knowing if blood warden will even be the same anymore.
---
like freddy's black box amirite /s
---
This is after nerf so it won’t be oppressive 
---
Legion going to join Freddy until Freddy is reworked
---
They change the rules and game play way too much and dramatically. It's hard to enjoy a game when it changes to benefit whiny people every few weeks especially when there was nothing worth changing in the first place. First Legion was ruined now the gameplay and killer get free sacrifice points that technically they didn't kill. If they're gonna make it so people don't drag the game on then it should punish the killer too if they don't get them in the 3 mins not give them free points. The survivor didn't escape they get killed but the killer didn't catch them ''Here free points.''..
---
It's not always possible. Know what we do? 
---
Suck it up
---
Eat it  
---
Move on
---
Basement blocking is just one of those things that I don't think can be properly addressed without fucking up something else badly. The basement is supposed to be super dangerous to save from, and the one thing that truly punishes those saves (especially with bt) is bodyblocking the stairs. 
---
One thing they can do is make it so that the end game timer is halted while an unhooked survivor is in the basement. It certainly wouldn't prevent trapping them there, but it wouldn't encourage them like the end game timer would. It would be the exact same situation as it is now. 
---
I think the best fix for infinite basement bodyblocking is a report system that actually works, sadly.
---
wtf how
---
Hatch will still spawn the way it does now, as confirmed by devs, so keys can still be used.
---
How did she do that?!
---
uh sorry to be that person but where can I get a screenshot of the jeff render being used as a thumbnail 👀
---
And The Doctor, you know, the killer who's all about tracking?
---
I LOVE ALL OF THE NEW CONTENT BHVR ADDS TO THE GAME BUT CAN YOU PLEASE ALLOCATE ALL RESOURCES TO FIXING THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF THE GAME WITH DCS AND 3V1S??? I GUARANTEE THAT IS PREVENTING POTENTIAL BUYERS MUCH MORE THAN A LACK OF ANOTHER KILLER OR ENDGAME MODIFICATIONS
---
Can’t hatch grab anymore
---
I mean this is only an issue for the last survivor right? Since an exit gate has to be openend for the end game to start.
---
Entity is Soul Weaver confirmed
---
They get their points, just not the last extra escape/chase ones they wait for sometimes
---
What does it even mean to respect a pallet?
---
No no, this is the Michael Myers "Make-A-Wish" mask
---
you monster.....
---
*laughs in stake out*
---
I give them the benefit of the doubt because the team has been more responsible and communicates with us more than any other developer at the moment. I give them my faith because I’ve followed the game since it’s release. Dev streams, creating forums, consistent content. There have been flukes but there have been moments where they have done us good. I know there is a consistent effort and to say there isn’t is pure delusion. 
---
I’d love some evidence of these god like pallet buffs and sound changes as I haven’t experienced anything out of the ordinary on my huntress.
---
Ability: the survivors are deafened like the beginning of a match on haddonfield last patch. "YEAAAAAAHHHH" from "won't get fooled again" by "the who" plays across the map every time the killer puts on his sunglasses (which he can do infinitely). This makes the survivors unable to hear the heartbeat.
---
I don't understand your logic, even if it was your first hook, you'd be on the hook for at most 2 minutes till sacrifice is complete right? So already in the game there's a more strict timer in place than the 3 minute collapse. 
---
It seems ridiculous to think no one will ever come to rescue during the collapse..though I will say I really would like to see a point modifier during that time like 50% bonus
---
No different than getting beat with 4 gens left, and you could have a key. Also, wow at the extreme hypothetical. If I’m facing this one killer who’s completely won against my team, and she finds hatch before I do, and the gates are within blinking distance, then I lose.
---
Someone message me the template the bot keeps deleting it :,(
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/news  That should have most of what you asked for.
---
When killer fears the stun and instead of following survior through the pallet they stop and wait before it. This allows good survivors to loop killer like that again and again.
---
I guess I would suggest watching youtube videos and things to get better (I personally like watching monto and ohtofu) and don't get discouraged it's hard at first but eventually I'm sure it will all start to click!
---
hold up, so killers can open the gate as soon as the match starts?  isn't that gonna lead to killers throwing the game the moment they rage a little bit? seems like this is opening the opportunity for killers to ruin games and make them suck for survivors. no?
---
Yeah, that's definitely correct. I guess the time it takes to do the gens doesn't actually matter if the killer is stationary at the hatch. I concede this debate unto you, good sir.
---
Nice! 😄👍
---
It’ll get added to PTB for testing first.
---
I’m not trapped in here with you... you’re not trapped in here with me either... erm... erm... *exposed*
---
You can thank all the assholes who Urban Evade around the map after the gates are open just to waste the killer's time.
---
This is such an intense way to end a game. And i love it.
---
Your colleague claims the oppisite https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1118910098267672576?s=09
---
There aren't many rank 20 or 19 people
---
That just makes me think that they used a dev command to spawn the hatch open.
---
It also makes me think if someone brings a key to a match and uses it to open the hatch when it spawns while survivors are alive (like at 1 gen needed/3 survivors alive) the killer can immediately trigger the Collapse if he closes the hatch after it's been opened.
---
Why not just have it be a ruin skill check and decrease skill check frequency by 300%
---
- That way they can't just spam the action button until a skill check is failed
---
- It's hard to hit the skill check (RIP my low console frames)
---
- It takes a while to actually get a skill check to appear instead of one popping up after 2 seconds
---
- Makes finding team mates to wake you up more appealing
---
At Rank 1 on console they are really nice if i run in a straight line.. god forbid i blind them or pass the same pallet more than once tho
---
for the killer the only benefit will be save time and not see survivors teabagging
---
for a survivor the benefit will be major as the chance escape even with no gen repaired
---
Does that mean there’s new animation for when the timer is up? Does the entity just go whoop! Just kidding! *gobble gobble* after the timer is up?
---
Yeah, I know that if you compare the time, you could save someone.
---
The problem is that already *now* people will run away if you get (first) hooked when the gens are done, I've died so many times for this reason. 
---
Try to guess if you put *another* timer, now not only on the hooked but also on the "unhooker". The hook timer put pressure only on the hooked, the collapse on the unhooker.
---
Almost no one will risk to save someone and maybe be chased by the killer until the timer runs out and then die.
---
I PLAY ON PS4 AND I'M A FREDDY MAIN.
---
You're the survivor I explicitly tunnel and camp. I don't even care if I get a 1k. If you're gonna be a douche and tbag me because you happened to hit me with a pallet and flashlight me when I wasn't doing anything other than just playing killer as normal, I will make the rest of your game literally miserable and end it so you wind up with the least amount of possible bloodpoints for time spent. You are nothing more than the literal personification of everything that is wrong with this game.
---
Where did they say that?
---
You would only need to report someone for “greifing” if your a cry baby who needs to get carried
---
There are actually quite a few ways to kill survivors without activating it, so I'll try to list them all here.  
---
Trapper traps, Hillbilly chainsaw, Nurse blink attacks, Huntress hatchets, Cannibal chainsaw, Pig ambush attacks, Legion feral frenzy attacks, and both versions of the plague vomit counter it since none of these things add a stack to metal of man.  
---
You can counter it by killing the survivor without hitting them a fourth time as well. Myers can insta-down with his power or kill outright with addons, and clown can instadown with an addon. Pig can also kill with head-traps sometimes. Using a Mori, Devour Hope, or Rancor will allow you to kill the survivor by your own hand in fewer hits than are required for MoM. Finally you can use perks that expose the survivors to down them in fewer hits. Perks that add the Exposed effect: Devour Hope, NOED, Rancor, Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground, Iron Maiden.  
---
Since only m1 attacks stack MoM you can also avoid it by grabbing survivors out of lockers, and off of pallets or windows. You can let them try to vault and pull them off, assuming you have already injured them. This also saves time compared to an attack cooldown and pickup animation as well. Even while MoM is active you should be able to grab a survivor off of something, since that doesn't put them into the dying state.  
---
You can also proxy the hook to allow for at least one hook stage progression. As long as the survivors is prevented from healing after that, they won't be able to activate MoM.  
---
These are all the ways I've found that MoM can be countered. Honestly it's a bit messed up that it's disproportionately powerful against the weaker killers, and countered by Nurse and Hillbilly.
---
All those kegel exercises paid off
---
Summons small flesh dolls of the survivors that are in the trial, if a survivor sees themselves they will scream? Maybe?
---
I'd just like not to play against greens. I've even gotten purples.
---
But you don’t see the weird man in the white mask standing behind you.
---
A perk that hides the hatch from survivors sight would be amazing!
---
Then they wouldn't be able sit and let the others die on hook as they teabag waiting for it to open
---
IDK. I think the devs said bodyblocking is ok as killer as long as it's not putting survivors in a state where they're forced to DC and it's to gain an advantage of some sort.
---
I.E. I think they deemed bodyblocking to rack up madness in the basement as doctor or wait out borrowed time is fine. It's possible even bodyblocking the basement as a Pig in stealth mode to prevent a chase from starting and the timer on a RBT from freezing so they die from the RBT is allowed. (No idea about the last one. Technically they're not being held hostage as they'll die from the trap)
---
black box is annoying tbf
---
Damn so the game changed well imma play it again later
---
I had someone do this before. It was Badham preschool and I was playing Leatherface. It was a Nea and Ash left. I was on the Nea but kept losing her (cause I'm actually bad but besides the point) and I'd find her at gens and do it over again. I wanna say it was a solid 15-20 minute match at that point with 4 gens left and just the 2 people. Eventually I see the visual cue and roll over to a Nea continuously opening the locker and the Ash pulling it closed. Killed them both just to get onto the next match. 
---
Post game chat was everyone swearing at the Ash for doing literally nothing but sitting in a locker all game. I actively felt bad for killing the Nea but hatch wasn't even on the map yet.
---
Rank reset is a useless mechanism to force engagement.
---
your answer is the most logical from every answer i've got
---
Lol try again brosef this integrity killer is rank 1 every month since all the way back when the pip system was based on kills and hooks only and survivors had instablinds, pallet vacuum, my wraith couldn't so much as open a locker or kick a gen while cloaked lol etc....At this point in the games balance where killers have never had it easier there is plenty of room to play with sportsmanship and still win consistently at rank 1.  I main primarily Trapper, Wraith and Freddy No NOED by the way so I'm not exactly Nursing it up to hit rank either lol.  I love you players that think it's a requirement to play like rank 20 trash and camp and hard tunnel into moris to win our games.  That tells me you're simply a weak killer that doesn't know how to make intelligent decisions midgame to play efficiently in chases and pressure gens.  It always cracks me up when I see your type of reply though when you assume the only way to approach killer is to crutch out your kills in the least skillful way possible.
---
I just saw the clip at 33 sec where 4 survivors are alive, with 4 gens still active and endgame initiated. If this is actually possible, I imagine purposely deranking is going to be even faster than before.
---
Leave noed and bw the fuck alone. They're mediocre at best as it stands.
---
**C R O N C H**
---
Dude, Friendship is Magic.
---
obviously the video information is the right one. you can see that the timer starts when the gate is fully open
---
Cool
---
Deathdarden? Is that a new game?
---
C R O N C H
---
Atleast now if a killer hatch camps you can call him out on it.
---
Yes you can, quoting /u/Peanits:
---
&gt; You can still grab a survivor if they jump into the hatch, unless they are in the dying state (just like before).
---
Possibly.  I’ve been toying with the idea of a summoner-style killer for a while now, but I’m not 100% sure if there’s any way to do that while not being overpowered or stupidly underpowered.
---
Anyone have a link to the end game changes
---
Survivors can no longer be interrupted when jumping in though.
---
Pretty cool idea.
---
Honestly, it's refreshing to have such a major change when everything has been more or less the same for a long time. This has the potential to be a big change in how the games turn out and I'm excited to see what happens with it. Especially with perk changes, too.
---
Just what I was looking for. Thanks!
---
How the fuck did she get up there?
---
spider bro....SPIDER BRO....\*\*SPIDER BRO\*\*
---
So far, he’d be the only killer with actual in game friends...
---
How is it a huge killer buff though?
---
Just last night I was in a game and all three of my teammates bum rushed the killer as soon as  one of them got hooked. He just rotated between them for a bit until I just said screw it because I didn't want to get in the middle of their nonsense/depipping party. It would be nice if the hatch opens in these circumstances.
---
Example: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/412648053?t=02h09m34s
---
the plot thickens  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/uWVRZBv](https://imgur.com/a/uWVRZBv)
---
I like the changes in theory, since it keeps the game interesting. It might be quite a bit more challenging for survivors. 3 minutes seems a tad short, but we’ll see. I get that there are toxic survivors and the game needs to end at some point and not in a hatch stand off, or survivors messing with the killer.
---
The timer slows by half for the duration of a hooking/dying Survivor, so in theory you can make the three minute timer last six minutes if you keep hooking survivors/slugging them from the very first second until the end.
---
&gt;Hatch can be closed by the killer
---
Thats a revenge from Legion mains.
---
keys can counter a killer closing the hatch on you at least
---
One of the devs said on Twitter the killer can no longer grab survivors out of the hatch, which is a beneficial change here.
---
Basically in a 1v1 scenario, whoever finds the hatch first wins
---
That's the same thing though man.  Killer finds hatch closes it then creates a guaranteed 4K because only the most potato of killers allows a survivor to solo repair gens as last one left to open a door.  You'd create an unwinnable match for survivor every time you closed it.  That isn't balance it's entitlement.  I'm not saying the system is perfect because it isn't.  I'm saying the system most likely cannot be properly balanced without gifting killers a gimme 4K.
---
idk how i feel about this, will have to try it out first. if there is not enough time to save a hooked survivor then it sucks.
---
Wtf is that second pic
---
I'll be honest, I usually hook somebody before I realize there was a DC. I've had this happen before, and had to apologize to the person in after-match chat. Whenever anyone DCs, I decide it's a farming match, though if it's only one DC, I'll have fun by slugging everyone and piling them up before I start letting them go. I wish there was some way to unhook a survivor, though I understand there's not really any reason to in normal gameplay.
---
They mentioned something about perks being looked at and revised based on this timer, that’s probably one of them
---
Considering the amount of bitching about the legion changes its hardly one side that does this
---
They did say the killer can active it anytime so guess will wait for PTB and see.
---
&gt; and near equal at higher ranks.
---
near equal? awful. it should be 100 percent survivor success
---
Man, NOED already makes people abandon an end-game hook. Add Collapse on top? Haha, nope. Your survivor buddies will be gone so fast you'll see a Loony Toons style dust cloud in the shape of their body.
---
Personally I would like them to allow double points for searching chests and breaking hooks/totems during the countdown, to give incentive to taking that risk.
---
GIB THE BOONEY
---
Hopefully, it will open the gates faster
---
Maybe everybody has a pig trap on their head and you want to put more pressure on them. Only use I can think of outside of bloodwarden and pray.
---
Victis as dbd characters plz devs

the legion changes have genuine concerns. this does not

On a Q&amp;A on the forum, devs confirmed what happened at 0:36 was triggered manually for testing purposes and we won't be seeing it happen in a normal game. (I.E. gates have to be powered first. Killer can't just open the gate at match-start)
---
I just like Saw...
---
They are gonna restrict killers opening the gates
---
Look at the past week and how people whine at rankings and pops, how do you wanna pop from a 3 min need game?
---
It would be the new DC to derank as killer
---
Devs said killer powers and perks will be changed for the end game. Lets wait and see what changes it will bring.
---
Then the killer just closes the hatch an chases from where the gen popped. I wish the hatch would reopen after like 2 minutes or something, just to prevent door camping
---

---
Watching the endgame trailer I randomly thought up of these designs, figured there would be a religion to the entity, not sure what it'd be called haha. 
---
I also wanted a survivor with a male/female interchangeable skin similar to legion.
---
Also thought maybe one of the survivor perks could be; Desperate Prayer- After getting hit once, you have 40/50/60seconds to stand still and pray for 3/4/5 seconds to the entity for protection, granting you momentary invisibility from the killer while standing still. Cool down 60/50/40seconds. 
---
Feel free to come up with perk ideas for both survivors and killer, just thought I'd share.
---
ENDGAME SPOILERS
---
Coolio.
---
put a trap on a teabagging claudette as the pig. open the gate and then tunnel that claudette until the entity kills her while all her friends abandon her
---
Timer is slower when people are hooked
---
So basically making the game harder for survivors than it already was. Thanks BHVR! and I don’t understand it even. It blocks generators and it makes the exit gate go slower? How the hell are you supposed to win?
---
Do what I do and hide so they don't get the satisfaction. They just stand there seeing nothing.
---
Just spirit studying real hard at school.
---
End game collapse
---
Dev on Twitter said that hatch grabs are no longer a thing
---
It's from the end game collapse video.
---
I'm pretty sure some actions give double or at least just more points once the gates are opened already, so that won't surprise me.
---
It is a chase extender most of the time, if people scape out of killers sight its mostly because they're bad killers. Only mediocre killers heavily complained about the DS. As Mediocre survivors crie for a nerf to NOED.

Soon, killers will also be able to do gens and heal.
---
Its normal you are being matched with the ranks you are
---
You'll never see it cominnnnnnnnnnnng
---
I can imagine the end game pig builds now. I feel like this will make her more stronger. Now you really have to waste time trying to get a trap off and if the killer already closed hatch the exit gate is your only escape.
---
Is it fair
---
Devs confirmed you can't open the gate until they are powered as killer. Bit of a shame because the idea of a "Instant Endgame" build sounds hilarious but I can understand why they prevented people from doing it.
---
Change Kate to Nea and it is ON!
---
Okay but when will we get the ability to stop a survivor from rescuing off of the hook?
---
3 minutes is still a bit long but understandable. I'm glad they finally did something to stop the god damn hatch stand off though.
---
Platform?
---
Cherry flavored toblerone?
---
One dev was live-streaming was played against a hacking killer, she quit, reported him, then said “I’ll verify the report when I go in tomorrow” so apparently they do get reports, maybe they just normally don’t care
---
If your teammates are all potatos, you have lost the game already. Still, you have the option to get the hatch and you don't even need to do gens anymore if your potatos teammates died before 2 gens are fixed, like it was before.
---
The assumption is when you close the hatch you see that last survivors aura bc it powers the gens
---
Y'know, in hindsight, I should have used Feng instead. Because smol survivor
---
20% cooler - Would probably give the killer some sort of boost after every sacrifice.
---
Sonic Rainboom - killer’s base speed is greatly increased while not in a chase.
---
Two Dictionaries and a Tree - Two hex totems are spawned.  The generator repair speed is reduced if both totems are active or both totems are destroyed.
---
I literally just came up with these and I didn’t check to see if something like them already exists.
---
You're so mad.
---
Ahhhhhahahahahhhh! Gets me every time! xD
---
Dude. I have a lot of games where survivors stay behind just to taunt and I love this
---
Thanks for the info, a lot of fair points!
---
Feng is cool
---
I mean it was against a freddy but I managed to kobe off a hook, run over to a gate, and open it then escape before he got to me, or even put my in dream state, so it is possible.
---
does closing the hatch power the gens? or the gates? ill watch the video again real fast because i don't recall closing the hatch powering gens, just the gates
---
A man of culture
---
Mate this is good. Nó idea if you are a fellow brony but awesome job.
---
I see. So this would force the last survivor to "speedrun" gate opening. But if he wants to "risk it" he can play the hatch and in the worst case scenario he loses if Killer finds it first.
---
I think I understand now.
---
See naw man, you’re falsely equivocating a killer intentionally using 2 perks that he chose before the game even started, previously breaking 2 pallets, then choosing intentionally to get stunned when it hurts the survivor most with getting stunned on accident lmao. Those couldn’t be further opposed and that’s what everyone is telling you. If you hate spirit fury + enduring so much, try running perks that would assist in a chase not centered around pallets such as balanced landing or lithe.
---
PC
---
Not really most people will be better than you but thats true for the game at any rank
---
Wasn't aware of that but it's a good thing. That really doesn't sound fun from a survivor perspective.
---
I swear to god 90% of the killers today are playing hillbilly... Including myself
---
I've just realized you can probably trick the survivors into the basement when the end game begins and be an ultimate toxic bastard and just stand at the top of the stairs so they can't get out.
---
I feel more pressure with RBT.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGzYaiiMlY
---
Once gens are done and a gate is opened (Killer can also open it manually if survivors are hiding and trying to drag the game out after gens are done) a 3 minute timer starts. (Timer slows when survivors are on the hook or downed) Once it ends any survivors still in the trial get killed by the entity. 
---
Killer can now close the hatch, which now ALWAYS spawns for the last survivor, even if no gens were done. Closing it instantly completes all gens and seemingly begins the 3 minute countdown, even though the door technically wasn't opened yet.
---
They said that this scene was a mistake to include, and they had triggered it through the use of dev commands. This will not be possible in a normal game.
---
We should have this as a cosmetic mask for Trapper.
---
Usually the PTB lasts 1 week, then they take a week to tweak things, then the update comes out. So 2 weeks total.
---
If I remember correctly it powers the gens? If you go check can u come back and reply bc honestly now that I saw this comment I’m hella curious. 
---
Whispers will still be pretty powerful tho, you can check for them as you look for hatch and easily check which gate they’re at once you close it.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
We were expecting a rework and all we got was depression
---
thats just another way of getting on top of your grades
---
okay i watched again and closing hatch will not proc bitter murmur because the killer closing hatch while gens are still up powers the gates and blocks off gens. it does not complete the gens
---
I like constructive critism but i want you to know that i suck at looping, im a gen jocke and my other friends is the looper but thanks
---
So indirect Blood Warden buff
---
I absolutely love this idea. One perk for the survivors could be called like, prayers to the entity and it could be something like when you get hooked for the second time instead of the entity being summoned you have one extra chance to get off the hook, or just completely add an extra hook, so instead of dying on the third hook you would get hooked for a fourth time to be sacrificed.
---
Dang, but still likely for the best. That would be super OP.
---
Still got whispers tho
---
Then this image is for you. 💁🏻‍♀️
---
About time BHVR
---
Also for the locker kill can it rip the survivor out of the locker for cool effects.
---
Well that's just rude literally made this meme yesterday and got half the upvotes :(
---
Or name him Scott Levy
---
I swear someone on Twitter said differently, though I don't know if that was bhvr official. 
---
If you can, that's honestly so dumb. Just camp hatch until you see the survivor, grab them if they go for it, or close it if they leave and do a gen, and pursue where they just popped it. I love the idea, but it feels like the devs just made it so closing hatch gives even more incentive to camping.
---
If you're using Spine Chill, is say drop dark sense for something else.
---
When you see Spine Chill light up, look around (always be looking around), and see if you can spot the killer. Avoid their line of sight if you can.
---
Oof, well there goes me thinking I was original, lol
---
Don't plan on watching the movie, so I'll keep a vigilant eye out for spoilers and do my duty by downvoting.

Hook survivor in basement after gates are opened. Wait for someone to come rescue, body block. PS4 Killers WILL find a way. But we’ll see.

---
That is how life works, yes
---
If you end up getting one, let me know what you think! I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with Design By Humans, but I actually really like how it came out.
---
extra pallets don't mean that much if we get hit through most of them anyways
---
Remember me would work well in the scenario where there's one survivor left and killer closes the hatch. This powers the gates and starts the timer, so as long as the obsession isn't the last alive then that survivor is likely screwed
---
If you end up getting one, let me know what you think! Want to get feedback on their QC.

⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆   
---
**This applies to mugs/posters/etc...**
---
This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.  
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print. 
---
Be careful, friends!
---
Did the devs say this somewhere? Because the video says otherwise unless it was done specifically for a test which would be weird
---
⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆
---
**This is OP's shill account to try and make this look ledgit. Its not, its a fake account. check the historys!**
---
I wish.  You just know that BHVR is going to nip that possibility in the bud.
---
Oh yeah it most definitely is ;)
---
If the Killer closes the hatch, that also starts the collapse before the doors are opened.
---
For me on some version of Android Mobile, I click the on community, (r/deadbydaylight) and then the ellipsis in the upper-right.
---
Sounds fucking stupid
---
I love flashlight gangs for the same reason. They get nothing done, throw in a few fake pickups and you can quickly injure the whole team.
---
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
It's too bad you can't see what killer you're facing otherwise this is good feedback. I'm not going to run that build every game on the offchance I face a Nurse.
---
Oh well I don’t report often lol.
---
rlly small :(
---
XD
---
If killers could simply close the hatch and completely deny an escape, it'd be OP as fuck.
---
The entire reason the hatch even exists is because if there's only one survivor left and 3 gens to go still, there is NO way that survivor can win. And if he had 3 shitty teammates who did nothing but die while he did 2 of the 5 gens by himself and unhooked them all, why should he be forced to die with NO chance at all over it?
---
Closing the hatch puts that scenario into full swing. That's not a good thing.
---
So end game collapse gives the killer a TOOL to use.
---
He doesn't HAVE to use it. But if he closes hatch to deny it, it powers the gates.
---
Survivors still have to open them. So he can now patrol gates and still stop them.
---
It's equally fair for both sides. That's the entire point.
---
And if Survivor tries to fuck around for too long and is too scared to actually make an escape attempt, they get killed by the entity.
---
So the timer FORCES them to make a play for the exit gate and thus killers can still have the upperhand in stoppping them.
---
There's literaly no reason the KILLER mains should be upset about end game collapse. It's in your favor....
---
Eh, I suppose looking back at my message, all the years of slugging for the 4k have made me feel that if you kill 3, you're entitled to kill 4. Maybe it's better if the survivor is able to jump in mid-chase. 
---
I feel that when it comes to how the end-game state is structured, it doesn't matter whether it's killer-sided or survivor-sided, what matters is that both players play a part and it takes skill from the killer to get the 4th kill, and also takes skill from the survivor to escape if they're the last alive.
---
Also this is mostly unrelated, but if the last survivor alive isn't the obsession, and the killer has Remember Me with several tokens and closes the hatch, that makes it pretty hard for the last survivor to get away. Maybe that's a neat new use for Remember Me, or maybe they'll rework the perk to be something different as they said they'll do with some endgame-related perks.
---
Adrenaline dead hard mettle of man and decisive strike
---
I’m very excited they finally added something like this, I think it’ll make gameplay on both side better
---
I think you've only faced bad nurses, because a good nurse will always get you, period.
---
I agree we need more objectives. 
---
I think the timer thing is mainly aimed to stop toxic survivors from hiding and *refusing to leave* after generators are done. Like going in a random locker, cycling between lockers and just hiding around the map on the move so there's no crows. It's not common, but when it happens it can be extremely frustrating because they can be impossible to find sometimes since they don't have any objectives to do, they can just hide anywhere.
---
With the timer, after enough time passes they'll die if they don't leave, so one form of arguably holding a match hostage is eliminated from the game.
---
I'd just delete her from the game honestly. She's not fun to play against.
---
I think you're missing the point.
---
Until the change, you can stop hatch escapes by relying on skill instead of luck by killing everyone before 2 gens are done. The change is making 4ks luck based instead of skill based.
---
“In Montos discord” - your first mistake
---
That’s a matter of opinion I suppose. I have fun against her, personally
---
I feel like it's already very situational, you have to take in the fact that the person you're chasing has been hooked twice already, the End Game Collapse timer is almost over, and there are still survivors bold enough to sit at the exit gate with that amount of time left.
---
It was so weird because I went to the hatch, the survivor stood in front of me, and I let her take it without any contest. I didn't face camp or nothing :/
---
Maybe when the crow you’re looking through is alerted the survivor’s aura will be visible for a few seconds, I think that could work.
---
Yes, you can. A hatch opened with a key can also be closed again by the Killer.
---
Sure but at least they fixed it. They fuck up but they clean their messes unlike most devs. These are humans and they make mistakes. It doesn’t help them that you feed them misinformation constantly and berate them for listening to you.
---
Thought so, that would be nuts if you could start ending the game immediately as killer.
---
Let's see: stalling - worse than Ruin at stalling, if you put me to sleep and then leave it's one skillcheck until back to normal. Good m1 mindgames how? Maybe for the 7 or so seconds during transition, but even then I can just see you lol. Stealth and tracking, sure he's a bit better at those than Leatherface for example, but stealth and tracking don't really matter at high ranks. Survivors will just loop the fuck out of you while nobody else cares if you're stealthy
---
Just trying to explain the meme for you.
---
NOED exists for a reason. If Survivors wanna bang out gens that quickly then it is their own damn fault for letting NOED activate.
---
That’s insensitive but really funny.
---
&gt;I feel like it's already very situational, you have to take in the fact that the person you're chasing has been hooked twice already, the End Game Collapse timer is almost over, and there are still survivors ~~bold~~ dumb enough to sit at the exit gate with that amount of time left.
---
That's considered a bannable version of body blocking.
---
I'M SO HAPPY WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO LEGION! THANK GOD!
---
Licensed character.
---
Adam would probably be the best bet, but I choose Claudette because she's apart of the O4 survivors.
---
and it would be funny seeing her wearing a dirty, oversized jacket.
---
And people that make fun of someone for something they have no control over have a micro penis.
---
Oh shit, I played myself.
---
I already do this as a survivor. Once had a game with 3 gens left and the other survivors were dead or dc'd. I saw him hatch camping. Instead of playing the whole hatch game I just went and did gens super immersed and strategically. I just 99% them as he wasnt leaving hatch area. Then I popped them one at a time, starting with a gen not too far away, then a close one to the hatch, then one farthest from hatch, forcing him to make a choice to leave hatch. This then gives me the choice of 3 exits. Which is why I never understood there being a standoff anyway. The killer should never win a standoff if you are clever. Obviously you won't be able to do this when the patch releases.
---
Sometimes it just be like that
---
Wow, the douchebaggery in this set
---
Freddy can do it in the Dream World :O
---
Which is almost always the killer because they can move around a map faster without fear of being detected and killed. I guess it’s cool they can’t grab you out the 1 out of 10 times you happen to beat them to the hatch though..
---
Can we get an Entity skin for her it all makes sense now
---
Key has other applications besides opening a hatch, so I'm doubtful it'll be removed.
---
Nah hatch spawns are still normal until there's only one guy left, it's just guaranteed to spawn for the last guy.
---
Rather get outplayed by hillbilly 20 times in a row than go down bc killer gets free hits the whole time
---
I don't know if you are new to the game, basically most of the people consider Legion the most unfun character to verse bcoz there is no counterplay, is he chase and tunnel you, you are practically dead
---
I didn't actually understand how this new thing works, like, does the hatch opens asap all gens are done even if there are still 4 survivors alive in the trial? Or does it open even if there are 5 gens left and there's only one survivor?
---
Okay, from my perspective as well as most high level players (read: those content creators you disagree with), the only thing that really matters is how fast can a killer end chases. Mobility is extremely nice as well, but nothing matters as much as being able to quickly end chases/loops. Freddy can't do that better than any other m1 killer, and his power doesn't provide enough utility on the whole to justify his weaknesses. You're right though, EVERYONE ELSE is wrong and you're the only person who can see just how good Freddy is
---
I've heard it still spawns and you can still use the key as usual, but the killer can close it if he finds it.
---
If you go to the Q&amp;A thread for this update on the DBD forums, the devs say that they were using console commands and that the gate can’t just be opened by the killer at anytime.
---
It's a combination of Tru3 and community.  
---
"Welcome to the Tru3-munity. Chat love guys."
---
you can't heal, repair, unhook, open chest, use secondary action while in madness III
---
Ikr. Idk why they punished us all but they did. We cant even share opinions on it 😂😂😂
---
I don't think the hatch spawns anymore until there's one person left, regardless of gen completion. So survivors can't try to find the hatch before one another.
---
No 'cause you lose the gatekeeper iridescent emblem doing so.
---
I just wish they'd get rid of the hatch at this point. Guaranteed 4k once the killer closes it
---
*wryyyyyyyyyy
---
It makes the obsession immediately visible to freddy, people tend to use it with dying light to tunnel a guy from the second the game starts
---
Entity’s husband wakes up at 6 am and mows the lawn, no survivors are awake asleep right?
---
Oh, I thought they could only trigger it once the gates are open.
---
Overall I like this a lot, but a little worried that there is no longer a way to escape if there is a killer that wipes the team. I get hatch standoffs suck a lot but now they are 100% killer sided since the gates get blocked off and the last survivor has 3 minutes before they die
---
i'm curious as to why reddit reports that there is one comment, but i don't see any
---
Two, the hill and the monument thing.
---
I would be furious if I was him, just livid. The perfect storm of perks to completely fuck me over at the last second.
---
Well, I mostly play survivor, but my legion is brand new. I've been putting BP into him, but I'm still very low level on killer
---
I can't wait to see the first round of VFX bugs that come with this!  
---
That's not a snipe at the devs, I promise! All games have bugs and stuff when new things are implemented. With all the crazy entity stuff flowing on the ground, I'm wondering what kinds of funny/freaky glitches and things we'll see along the way!
---
Exactly! If survivors fuck up, they get punished. If they don’t, they escape. That’s how it should work.
---
Can we talk about the possibility of how broken The Pig will be at the end game if more then 1 person has a RBT on?
---
I once made a Pig build that was all about trapping survivors in the basement with active RBT's on their heads. It rarely worked, but one game it worked fantastically with all 4 stuck in the basement and 3 with RBT's ticking down. I secured 3 head pops and let the last guy go because as effective as it turned out, it made me feel dirty. I see this scenario as being similar, at least all the survivors still got full basement points, so it wasn't all bad for everyone.
---
A dev confirmed that the hatch still spawns as it does now, but will also spawn when there is one person left, regardless of gens completed.
---
Guess it's for the best cause it will end up being abused by many.
---
If you have Nvidia Freestyle enabled you can throw on colorblind filters to help see red and what not. Personally I find it very infuriating that the game has been out for more than 2 years and they haven't done anything about it, limiting a portion of players to play survivor or handicap themselves.
---
Your submission has been removed from /r/deadbydaylight for the following reason(s);
---
* **Rule 8** - Oversaturated Content. Oversatured posts are common &amp; uninteresting posts that do not add anything of value to the subreddit.
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.
---
Haha i feel like an extra life would be OP but maybe instead have a chance to call on the entity to break the hook upon a skill check much like DS, can only be preformed once per match and if you miss it then you can't try again.
---
It's like 2 min in dream with remember me maxed out.
---
It's apart of the main mode.
---
If your friend has a nvidia card tell them to press alt+F3 in game (that opens freestyle which has colorblind settings).
---
no, they're unplayable for a number of killers.
---
As a red/green color blind person myself, I sadly don't see this happening. You'd have to correct the color res by making it a near florescent, and I don't see BHVR doing that because non-killer blind Killers would abuse it to see them easier.
---
It would be *frosty eyed huntress. 
---
Maybe, like, open a book or something instead of being a twat on reddit
---
i know you're asking about perks, but the best advice i can give you is to play a few games as killer. This will allow you to see the challenges that killers face, as well as what strategies survivors use against the killer.
---
good luck out there!
---
In other words, get f*ked by calm spirit, the killer. And also, there are WAAAAAY to many crows to be channeling from one to the other at random
---
Honestly would love to have an event where certain buildings and tiles were lit up in different colors like this picture. It would look so cool.
---
As a pig main, that map is actually pretty geared towards her. U can hide in the grass/ bamboo near gens for ambushes. Gens are also pretty well positioned for Surveillance. A bad map for Pig would be Lampkin Lane in my opinion, as most of the gens are in empty buildings or in areas of limited mobility like near fences or in backyards. There is also nowhere to really hide as her due to the lack of cover...
---
An interesting alternative to this could be that the killer can just wrench the door partially open to start the collapse, so the survivors can get out, but it might be dangerous because the opening is basically single-file. Then they could still use the lever to open it fully if they wanted a safer exit, but that would be time spent during the collapse.
---
lol that was intended, wanted him to have slight abnormal humanoid features, big hands big feet but maybe should have designed his body to be more primal to match
---
Everyone else has to die for it to be used
---
Who in their right minds would do this? Half the time I just leave the hatch because I'm so freaking bored during hatch stand offs.
---
Someone who doesn’t wanna patrol two exit gates when the hatch is right  in front of them
---
\*worlds smallest violin plays\*
---
The meta is to close out the game hopefully before all the gens are done. It’s about as NOED would be in a situation where the survivors are even capable of finishing all the gens.
---
Damn
---
Because, Brad, gay people play this game too.
---
yes, thank you, i fully realize that survivor mains do not give a shit whether or not the game is playable. thank you for illustrating
---
There is a perk that does that already -_-
---
Oh my god I am so sorry Mr. Myers
---
oh ok thanks!
---
Bad wording I meant appreciate your humor despite the situation, I get your point totally
---
WOW! thanks devs allow the killer to activate end game whenever he feels like it even with 4 gens remaining. 
---
I think we did a pretty good..job so far..pretty good job so far! ;)
---
It's Daddy Myers.
---
Mr. Myers would be Nick Castle.
---
We can’t say if it was intentional or not. Unless you happen to be part of the development team. 
---
I’m gonna give them the benefit of the doubt since I like the change. 
---
BHVR needs some wins.
---
Well go ahead. I'd love to hear it. I'm curious what perks he was using if he wasn't using NOED.
---
It's not playing around though. Doing totems is usually a good thing.
---
Well... they’re not really tentacles.
---
 The Entity's Realm itself is collapsing. The Entity hungers, it loses control over itself. Like a starving stomach it begins to constrict without conscious thought. Iridescent blood runs through the ground like hellish digestive fluid. You will leave, or you will die.
---
It absolutely is Freddy. Only killer that you can unhook someone in front of and they can’t do anything
---
**Developer Request:** Can we get a unique entity kill animation if a survivor is in a locker?
---
I think it would be wicked to see the entity crush a locker.
---
The more I play survivor the more I like Feng.
---
Considering he's about to be a 115 Killer, everyone will want to be healed you dunbass.
---
I love this!
---
At first I thought it was stupid, but now it makes sense, kinda.. I actually don't get it.. Can someone explain this to me?
---
that's tough chief, only thing I can suggest is messing around with TV settings and see if you can alter the color
---
If they start the endgame, the exit doors are immediately powered. If they facecamp, that sucks, but the remaining survivors should have no problem escaping just like they do now. Not to mention, the timer progress slows significantly if someone is hooked/downed, so it ought to still be possible to rescue. It shouldn't make facecamping much worse than it is now.
---
NO - hatch spawn in thew same manner OR when 1 survivors left up even if u dont do any gens
---
I guess that makes more sense, but that isn't how I understood it from the video.
---
The biggest flaw is the fact dream transition doesn't freeze action progress. (IDK if it slows it, but it definitely doesn't freeze it.)
---
Freddy ends up having gens near completion popped or totems cleansed because the survivor has time to finish it up before Freddy can do anything about it. Any other killer the survivor has to abort and run away because you can engage in combat immediately. 7 seconds doesn't seem that long but when your hex totem is being cleansed in front of you it is infuriating.
---
It isn't - but since Legion is becoming a 115% movement speed Killer, forgoing healing is going to be too risky for most people. In that sense, making it harder for people to heal is going to force survivors to waste so much time.
---
Woah! Just how I envisioned it!
---
I mean specifically what about this makes you say 'this sounds basically awful'?
---
This picture of Jeff stirs feelings in me.
---
This is so funny and ridiculous at the same time - the fact that you can steal the survivor points
---
well killers are faster than survivors and dont have to worry about a killer looking for them who wants to kill them so killer mains always had the advantage in searching for the hatch yet they still found a way to complain about that
---
The latter, hatch will open for one survivor regardless of gens done.
---
At last.
---
Yep, it's a sound effect similar to light gleaming or a sword unsheathing.
---
But the game is still going on a timer, so because things in the game are still happening, it is not bannable. Same for pig bodyblocking someone with a trap in the basement. Its clearly bullshit, but do you tgink the devs care?
---
Everything I just said? How much more can I spell it out...
---
I'm skeptical about all the changes and personally dont think they'll be as great as people think.
---
Pretty straight forward bud.
---
It's too wacky as concept for me ... I will shut that hatch down so fast, you have no idea. But realistically speaking, all the gens will be blocked off and won't need to be repaired, so if the killer camps the hatch then one just needs to go power the exit gates.
---
2 Kills with us standing right there with no camping penalties... LF are going to creme themselves
---
Lowkey gonna call monto out for being what he is... a negative nelly. I noticed once monto got popular, he’d only reply to comments he assumed were attacking him, and the rest of his fans would shit on the person. I see it happen a lot, not surprising his discord is the same.
---
Then don't go rescue the person who got hooked in the basement after the gates are opened?
---
When has any survivor even been too afraid to go for the exit gates? And it only takes about 20 seconds to open the gate so if you picked the wrong one to go for or RNG fucks you over with the spawns you loose.
---
The fuck was that wry?
---
~shook~
---
Well legion wasn’t OP just very unfun to play against because there was no counter-play.Now I do think nurse should get changes as well, for example I personally think she shouldn’t be able to have more than 2 blinks. Yes nobody wants to face nurse after nurse but nobody would that with any of the killers.
---
Even if it’s okay it makes for a terrible game for the survivor. I get that every round shouldn’t be SUPER FUN but what a waste of time if someone just body blocks you in the basement. Considering how long it can take to load into games sometimes this is especially problematic.
---
I dont mind monto but really it was his mod. None of us can do anything now so thats why i went to reddit. It really sucks tho :/
---
...or if someone’s doing something like helping the killer.
---
It’s because the developers only listen to the loudest community members and, from what I’ve seen, those tend to be killer players. It’s not that they don’t have valid points but when all your input is one sided obviously you get issues like this.
---
Right? Haha, Thanks
---
Its not currently in the game but has been tested before on Ptb. As killer you’ll just walk up to it and hold M1 or whatever and you stomp it closed.
---
I feel like if the 4 survivors can't get a measly two generators done, the last survivor shouldn't be graced with the hatch, but that's just me.
---
Didnt it say when there is only 1 survivor left all gens are blocked so the only option is hatch? So basically the killer can just stand at the hatch for 3 mins and win. If your with a shitty team you rely on the hatch and if its how i think it is honestly they should just take it out
---
Guess survivors gotta start bringing keys.
---
Oh good. I questioned just how bad a truly was to not have realized this if it was doable today.
---
Honestly, I would be disappointed if the Entity did not end up being a Drag Queen.
---
The thing is the jags put traps in walk ways and loop spots I guess because they know your screen will get hijacked and it will mess up the loop. It's always worse because they usually aren't around a objective. They are in random spots so you dont think to crouch nor do you have time in a chase to crouch past all these traps.
---
Because they are totally unable to be mind gamed and the placement of the windows means that the survivor can just loop it until the window gets blocked off. I actually think the wretched shop one might be the right length to prevent the entity blocking the window though.
---
Samsung qled tvs have a color blind app called see colors.
---
Just my experience with monto. Who chooses the mods, think about it. I commented once making a joke about how he said in game “my new billy skin is pay to win” and he got SO MAD and sooo many people jumped in.
---
I did it a few more times to gauge the people watching his stuff/him and I was weirded out. That’s dumb when people can’t talk about their own opinions. But some people want everyone and everything around them like them so they can be comfortable lol..
---
Because:
---
- Immersed survivors crouching around the map for 10 minutes isn't fun for killers.
---
- Being the only survivor left with 4 gens remaining isn't fun for the survivor.
---
- Hatch standoffs are not fun for either party.
---
This solves all of these issues.
---
But who was phone?
---
All I did was hook the guy ;-;
---
The implication from what they say seems to be that only survivors will see these effects, so fingers crossed.
---
He did nothing wrong.

---
Hillbilly, Pig
---
**A**-  Killers who only skip leg day when they’re REALLY sick.
---
Wraith, Clown, Plague, Nightmare, Trapper
---
**B**-  Killers who either skip leg day somewhat regularly, or don’t do enough cardio training
---
Legion, Myers, Cannibal, Spirit
---
**C**-  Killers who who only do leg day when they feel like it.
---
Doctor
---
**D**-  Killers who never do leg day.
---
Huntress, Hag
---
**F-  Killers who literally don’t know what leg day is.
---
Nurse
---
lol what a fucking stupid thing to do. why not just have an actual scenario in the vid.
---
This is top notch material
---
lol that would be the most broken shit. oh hello survivors no pip for you because i opened the gate in 2 min.
---
This update also stops:
---
- Immersed survivors crouching around the map for 10 minutes instead of doing objectives, which isn't fun for killers.
---
- Being the only survivor left with 4 gens remaining, which isn't fun for the survivor.
---
- Hatch standoffs, which are not fun for either party.
---
I think a Lawyer skin would fit him more, but Orpheus is the head of the game.
---
Im talking about How healing after using the extra hit will give the killer a "basically" constant aura on you, even if you lose them they will be right back up on you.
---
I typically run Distressing, Unnerving, Overcharge, and BBQ (Just got Ruin so I might start using that instead of BBQ) 
---
Distressing and Unnerving makes your terror radius bigger, and makes skill checks harder in your terror radius + more points. Overcharge for stalling gens (The overcharge skill check is affected by Unnerving making it even harder to hit). BBQ for more points and tracking (especially with railgun doc)
---
For addons I love the Calm addons for an even larger terror radius, IDK how much the fake heartbeat helps, but you can stack a purple and a yellow for an even larger radius. Interview Tape and High Stim Electrode gives you a railgun build. 
---
I might try replacing BBQ with something like Ruin or Huntress's lullaby for more stalling and harder skill checks, but to be honest I hate hex perks because they can often get cleansed early on you.
---
Seriously though 🙄 The RNG of the trap unlock things is already dumb enough
---
I’m not very experienced with color blindness, but is there a color that would be more visible, without being a super-buff for regular-visioned nerds? I would assume that blue or green scratch marks wouldn’t be too different but still work to not give an advantage to normies.
---
I’d be down to contact BHVR en masse to make the change happen sooner than later. Exclusivity where it can be prevented sucks.
---
Its a global meme, around for several years mate :/
---
The video seems to say that closing the hatch immediately triggers Endgame Collapse, which is synonymous (and simultaneous) with the doors opening, so it's just exchanging one race for another.
---
I've played a lot of leatherface, it's plague that I've played less
---
A fair point, but i still wouldn't say the perk is overpowered, since by that logic you could do the same with no mither
---
we just gonna draw triangles under the lever till it decides to open lol
---
 i dont see his perks getting reworked as they arent a part of his powers
---
Freddy nerf? Huh? Also totally different situations tbh.
---
I was disappointed that the entity didn't pop out of the locker with him impaled only to drag him back inside the locker and close it.
---
i agree. this update destroys the possibility of hatch camping
---
Body blocking concerns me a lot. Any bad killer can just trap survivors in the basement if they know they'll all die within the time limit.
---
MOOOM! THE SURVIVORS AREN'T LEAVING!
---
If their team is so incompetent that instead of sifting through reports they just throw them away, then there shouldn't be a reporting system in the first place
---
It just depends on the map layout. If the hatch is semi close to a door then you will likely be able to patrol both gates if it is not one of the huge maps.
---
Bitter Murmur will pretty much guarantuee a kill after closing the hatch so the perk might get more usage after the change.
---
If you play it smart as a killer you will see if closing the hatch is a good decision before closing it depending on the exit gate positioning. You don't have to close it. There will be situations where it might be better to leave it open.
---
Can a killer choose to open one exit gate or would they open both?
---
It's clear to see that I'm the one that's excited for the upcoming patch. No more survivors dancing around at the open gate, hopefully no more pointless  hatch standoffs
---
Lol just wanted to you go into more detail, I'm not gonna try to convince you of anything. If you didn't want to talk about what you said why bother saying it in the first place?
---
Its no where near Freddy lmao. The hate for him is way overblown on here, hes mid tier. 
---
I'd say its LF personally, his chainsaw is so hard to land against good survivors, 99% of the time hes an m1 killer.
---
Well if the Killer has more power for as pong as the survivors did then it would be balanced
---
They won't be able to do it right away. It's only after the gates are powered up after the gens are done/the hatch gets closed. Same conditions as the survivors. :D
---
IT WAS RU! RUPAUL!
---
Well done sir, died at the horrible computer voice "totttemm"
---
how the fuck is the killer supposed to even get anyone if they do that? Survivors will just hide then dart out the open gate or open the other one after the killer passes by
---
You can lose the match faster.
---
The timer doesn't start until the hatch is closed. So survivor is free to do gens for as long as they want to draw killer away from hatch.
---
Please make a post about it for visibility, it might happen !
---
Well, nothing happens without some kinda action. I’ll fill out a form, and however many people wanna join in, that’ll make the devs see it as a more pressing matter to deal with. 
---
[Colorblind Option Request Form](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=228563) 
---
I hope I’m making some kinda difference 😯
---
Wise up? Nobody is saying he didnt need work. Our issue is they didnt try reworking him they just went and did what they did best and nerf it to the ground instead of putting any effort.
---
just restarted PS4 and seems 2 have fixed it 4 me
---
That's fair. All I'm saying is that the community could be partially responsible for this for abusing the report system for any little thing.
---
BHVR definitely needs to step up their game with reports and bans, but people also need to not abuse a report system for whatever reason because that makes it harder for the ban team to know what's real and what's just someone reporting for tunneling as abusing an exploit.
---
But no mither is a one hit down with almost nothing good about it and mettle of man can help you tank almost 5 hits with only a tiny downside
---
Myers and Billy can directly counter MoM and nurse is strong enough that you just play through it. Trapper's traps work regardless of MoM, but he's not competitive. 
---
So of the top four, nurse and spirit are hurt by MoM, the other two have a built in counter to it. Below that, frankly, either you're not doing well and you're playing against survivors that are equally bad, or you've made it to lower ranks where weaker killers just don't cut it. BHVR will literally never balance the game well enough that all killers are equally good, and the answer to that isn't to remove every good perk survivors have so players can have fun playing Freddy at R1.
---
Having just bought SW today, I approve this.  Shes as fast at flying through the map as the entity is fast at killing
---
Kage Bushin no Jutsu! narutoActionMusic.mp3
---
why would you want to shorten the game like that it makes no sense.  This seems heavily killer sided.  Not a good change all around.
---
Yeah, I just checked it out. I wonder what opening the gates looks like from the Killer's perspective.
---
I'm a console player you moron.
---
I'm not talking about gameplay or rank mechanics. I'm referring to the performance and all the hiccups that accompany it.
---
I like this a lot better than the Legion nonsense. A timer was the essence of my End-Game suggestion thread, though mine was 2 minutes. I'm a bit wary of 3 minutes, especially since the timer seems to slow down to a crawl when a survivor is downed or hooked. That could extend the game by minutes more. Just how slow does the timer slow down? I also would like to know about keys and how they factor in this this, and whether or not the hatch is visible before the last survivor dies.
---
I have some suggestions/ideas to tweak this.
---
1. Pick one, either the timer should slow down when someone is downed or slows when someone is on hook. Not both.
---
2. Just in case this is the case - it shouldn't be affected by how many people are hooked/slugged (ie it shouldn't double in it's slowing down if you hook/slug two people).
---
3. The hatch must not be visible at all before the third to last person has been sacrificed. Otherwise survivors will just camp it while a killer is chasing/carrying the third survivor. Give both sides a chance to get to the hatch first by not revealing it's location until the third survivor has died.
---
4. The end game must affect keys obviously, and this is how: Keys should re-open the hatch for a one-time use if a killer finds it first and closes it.
---
5. I think 5 gens being powered should trigger the end game for survivors - not when an exit is opened. The game is over already once an exit is opened, and there's no pressure. End game collapse should trigger when all gens are completed as survivor, or when a killer starts it early by opening a gate.
---
Honestly what a mood
---
I guess that is true but at least it is something and there is always the chance someone mends too long in radius and he catches them. Maybe even combo with M&amp;A which is actually better on him now with these changes. At this point it is throwing a bone to what will be a very awkward change to this killer.
---
It's just his power
---
Even I didn't realize that until now lol
---
If killers can close the hatch, last remaining survivor should be able to open it whether they have a key or not, otherwise that's a gigantic advantage to the killer, even if closing the hatch powers the gates.
---
It looks more like I'm the only one complaining. But I think it will be really really hard to play as survivor... I really like killer too so it's fine but I don't want to play hard as survivor and so easily as a killer...
---
I'm not attached to ranking but honestly I can't stand most of the 15+ survivors. They never help, and when they do they are not doing gens at all... It's already hard to rank now but what now with this update? Impossible to win AND to help.. Especially with bloodwarden and noed.
---
If the killer is really dedicated to this, the survivor can still do gens until the killer closes the hatch. The killer can no longer do hatch grabs, so a really sneaky survivor could try to risk it.
---
I think because her model is already there, just in the transition animation
---
I hope they release it soon
---
Maybe I counted wrong
---
That would require completely redoing every landmark and the Killer shack. They only know nerfs not redesigning
---
Right but my point stands even if they have their hands tied on console they can release a different patch for pc if it is so simple. Other games have had separate patches on pc than console so it is not a new concept.
---
TIL?
---
Actually, that's what they are NOW which I think is a welcome change. They weren't "who finds hatch first" because when a killer finds hatch first, it becomes a hatch standoff that a survivor can still easily win, granted they are patient/competent. When surv finds it first, they win (rightfully bc they found it first and beat the killer). Its just been balanced so the killer, which is the power role in an asymetric competitive game, can actually do their job of being an obstacle that must be overcome, not a toy that gets played with. (I play both surv and killer, and have been in red ranks w/ both)
---
"*bing bong, your opinion is wrong"*
---
Prolly trippin.
---
&gt; Killer can open a gate, triggering the end game any time.
---
Don't survivors have to finish the gens first or be the last one standing for killers to be able to do that?
---
This is true. And the community is definitely to blame. But there's not much you can do. This kind of game attracts and creates toxic immature players
---
I don't care about karma.
---
You wanted to be asinine and argue.... my feelings are stated clearly and concisely in my first post and in my first reply to you.
---
It was straight forward and simple.  You're transparent and where trying to complicate the matter to start an argument or gain some kind of leverage.
---
... otherwise, you would have just disagreed or stated your own opinion. But you didn't. Like a greasy politician you just focused on dismantling my opinion versus providing your own.  
---
Thanks I guess. I'll be ignoring the rest of your responses though. Not into wasting my energy on trolls
---
Only the veterans remember
---
Awesome thanks for your help
---
Today I Learned
---
Pure degeneracy
---
that's not accurate. op's concern is stupid, but not for this reason. killer can start end game at any point
---
Also unfortunately there will be hatch standoff as well. If not more...
---
Killer waiting at the hatch, mostly with insidious on &gt; seeing survivor &gt; either grabbing him or closing it in front of them &gt; death is actually the only escape...
---
Who is this guy? He looks stoic af
---
I agree.. still a lot for us to understand. Hopefully when the PTB comes out we'll get a better idea of what's going to happen.
---
I swear, billy is so overpowered with a low skill ceilling/cap compared to nurse. I feel like they should make his job harder somehow, but while conserving his identity as M.Map pressure
---
Well, Trapper could block it, Billy and Bubba would love to block the gate that way and Amanda would force rushing for trapped survivors. About the rest it may be hard
---
I'm not saying it should be implemented, I'm not even saying I want It, I'm just saying it would've been unique, and wouldve caused for a more intense match
---
Take it as a challenge. Don't let them discourage you. When they wait to drag their nuts — just suck it up and find them. Give them their requisite slap on the ass. You get points for doing so.
---
Don't disconnect — and never surrender till they're dead or out the match. I've turned 0K into 4K with both exits open.
---
Look back and think about the mistakes you made. Don't give a shit about the stupid ranking system. Just play to win.
---
You'll get there, homie. Don't sweat the insults you get after the match. They do that when you kill them 'cause they gotta justify it.
---
You're allowed to tunnel and you're allowed to camp.
---
Their altruism will be their undoing.
---
Also, don't be afraid to leave one or two slugged while you secure the 4K. Just remember that it only takes a second for them to get healed. They also have perks that'll give them the ability to do weird shit from time to time. You'll learn to recognize that shit over time.
---
It all comes down to constant practice and correcting your mistakes.
---
He isn’t wrong. Even with this update those preaching about how it brings in the horror again are going to get used to it and it’s going to lose its initial scare factor. Then they’ll whine about the next thing.
---
As evil  as that is I would have laughed so hard if a pig did that to my friends and I. If all of you are stuck in the basement with traps the killer can't really pass up on that opportunity!
---

---
If the survivors die from collapse, then it's because the killer pressured them to stay for saves and defended the gates long enough to get those sacrifices. If it's really just from a survivor being stupid and not leaving, that's just the survivor giving the killer a kill.
---
1.3k upvotes... Yup, you're definitely the one I. The right here.
---
Thanks for utterly unwarranted insults.
---
3 minutes is a decently long time in this game and the timer can be slowed down. how is it "more challenging" exactly?
---
When they still need to finish a gen to get the gates open instead of just going for hatch?
---
Or when gates are within 100 feet of each other and killer can literaly stand in the middle and camp both and rush any survivor that attempts to open one?
---
And as to your last part. That's kinda the point? If it's 50/50 if the survivor gets lucky or not, that's a EVENLY BALANCED chance in favor of both survivor and killer......
---
How is that BAD for killers and favoring survivors if it's an equal chance it could end up in eithers favor......?
---
That's like saying a coin toss is unfair because the other person could get lucky and have the coin land on the side they called.....
---
I personally run away to find the totem not because I think the killer is coming my way.
---
What is this endgame update I’ve been hearing about? Haven’t played the game since October.
---
Idk why this has downvotes. People did this
---
Thanks! I managed to jump on tonight and grab it xD
---
what the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
I wonder if Whisper will be deactivated when i close the hatch. I it isn't, it's pretty much a gg for me.
---
*Bloodwarden* okay ***now*** you're trapped in here with me.
---
And noed/remember me. Oh boy
---
Yes because waiting thirty minutes for the nurse to give up and leave, only for you to escape, is the preferable option to a set timer.
---
You literally described the problem this is aiming to fix when you described why you think it's broken holy fucking shit dude
---
They will make like bigfoot and continue to not exist.
---
It's funny because they even used trollface. No one looked at it and said "Trollface is so funny!", No people said "They used trollface? That's funny."
---
That's what you're not getting. Honestly sad I even need to explain it.
---
You can prevent Noed ? Use "Small Game" or "Detective's Hunch" to locate the totems.
---
This is the only meme that has made me laugh fron this subreddit.
---
You need to fall off the right spot on the monument for it to trigger. The gap is so small if you don't fall off the correct part, the fall is too short and it doesn't activate. So it's still a bitch.
---
But you are correct.
---
Still a bad map for balanced landing.
---
I thought the wording on bitter murmur states something like “once the exit gates are powered...”
---
Imo the pig crouching is an exploitation of game mechanics just like what the legion did but it's not getting banned. Not sure what they would do with it anyway.
---
I guess anything could be an expolitation if you tried hard enough.
---
Maybe after the killer stays in a certain area for too long, they lose their collision and the survivors can slip through. The killer can still hit them though so they'd still have to time it right.
---
Locking the survivors is putting them at a disadvantage and the killer the advantage. If the killer can get a survivor in the basement and block it it's an absolute 100% kill and they can do literally nothing about it. Now it completely discourages end game basement saves.
---
That is unfair to survivors.
---
It would be the same if they made all survivors kobe on their 1st try which would screw over the killer.
---
Either way it seems like a bigger issue.
---
Shelter woods is probably worse tho, only one.
---
Don't be toxic and you'll be fine. Plus honestly bloke other people have said, I don't thing it actually does anything anyways.
---
How does one have to do with the other ?
---
You’d think, but not promising knowing BHVR.
---
I thought it was only for when the hatch is already open due to being the last one alive/someone else escaping via key.
---
That's a nice buff to key then, if you can open the hatch and escape in the killer's face.
---
I'm just trying to explain what that dude up there was thinking, I think the use of the troll icon is justified in it's existence as a symbol these days for, well, trolls.
---
Way to tasty. I’d eat at least too, two.
---
Is that like something you put on posts to make it easier to read. Been using Reddit for less than a year and I'm still learning new stuff.
---
And of course I can only picture Dwight saying this.
---
This is really dumb if you think about it. If exit gates spawn close together, it's game over for the survivor. The new hatch mechanic would also heavily favor the killer.
---
Idk man, after every chase? That seems a bit too strong. Maybe you could do every 3/3/2 or 3/2/2 because it doesn't even cause exhaustion, so it's really strong. Maybe just ever 3/3/2 chases
---
Guilty as charged.
---
YES
---
**YES**
---
[***YES***](/intensifies)
---
*If you know.*  
---
Otherwise, camera flick is killing you instantly.  
---
That's why I don't like rusty shackles, they remove camera flick.
---
Nope. Gens only.
---
Not enough dark colored hunks to complete the meme. BHVR please.
---
All I needed to see was that hatch closing for me to say "helllll yesss"
---
My bad, thought you were the original person.
---
Ignoring the rest of your points, since we're clearly both wasting our time here;
---
&gt;3. In other words, if you had the AUDACITY to want to play Hag, Spirit, Doctor, Wraith, Freddy, or Clown.
---
 &gt;4. Trapper has to get lucky to get around MoM, and playing him is putting yourself in a hole.
---
These two points literally contradict each other. Either MoM is a problem because it makes specific killers unplayable, or certain killers are unplayable despite their ability to counter MoM (in this case, trapper). Ergo, MoM isn't the thing holding these killers back. Nurse and spirit are good despite having low counterplay, leatherface counters MoM hard and never needs to M1, but is unplayable.
---
For that hypothetical situation, the hatch would have to be close to the gates too, which are also close to each other? And the killer has to find it near instantly to prevent at least one gate being opened. All that seems pretty unlikely, but even assuming that it'd happen, your other matches would be improved by this change.
---
It's amazing how much money they'd make off this thing though. It's such a good skin
---
Dude get your head out of your survivor ass. Seriously. I wanna see the shitpost full of tears the moment something happens to "self care" and the other clutch survivor perks. I bet you broke a keyboard with the DS nerf didn't you two-face?
---
This x10
---
I'll be disappointed if they never add a drag queen killer.
---
Stop worrying about the nonexistent controversy. I want to slaaaaaay!
---
Yeah I guess. It’s like “lol” ,etc.  easier to type sometimes. Plus I am on mobile so.
---
Interesting, i didn't thought about that. Yeah, a Claw attack could apply a quick hindered effect or maybe disorient the Survivor similar to the Hag's trap activation.
---
It sounds fun, but why start using up your Bloodwarden almost immediately? Unless you mean a scenario where you know others are close to the hook.
---
Bloodwarden and Remember me are solid and will probably not be reworked, maybe tweaked a bit at most. Fire Up on the other hand.
---
I mean. Fire up is barely used and remember me might be even less useful now. So eh
---
I miss transit.
---
What did I say that made me seem like an entitled survivor? Honestly I wanna know. Look through my post history, I’m a PS4 Trapper main with a 60-70% killer play time. I don’t play survivor often because of the atrocious wait times.
---
Same. TIL something new I guess.
---
You cant predict every chase.
---
there is one clip in the video where all 4 survivors are alive with 4 gens still up, and the endgame collapse suddenly begins.  how does that work?  can the killer open the gate whenever they feel like it?  
---
if so, are there any concerns of how this could be abused by the killer to make games very short so nobody will pip?
---
The Plagg ❤️
---

---
I love how, in these memes, the Entity is always played by RuPaul.
---
She's the perfect fit, really.
---
I can see going for an obsession, if the obsession is part of a perk build. It doesn't make it fun for the survivor, but.. I can see it. I am not saying don't kill, don't work your build. I have seen clips of many mtg rages too, so I know it happens. I guess it's more about the toxicity I see in end game chat from killers that bother me more than anything. Even when I play killer, I still see it. Over the last few weeks I have seen so many players telling people to go kts, and have had it said to me. It's not a fun experience to have a rough game, then see the toxic chat in the end.
---
IMO survivors shouldn't feel secure which is why noed is fine where it's at. Survivors should leave when they can and not stick around. Noed is the perfect counter to cocky survivors. Especially if you get get the run around from 1 or 2 solid survivors while the other 2 knock out generators. SWF only makes noed even more viable to inexperienced killers and less to more skilled killers. I personally don't use it ingame because I strive to get better because honestly I'm pretty trash at 12-15 in rank killer and survivor. I'm a casual player so that probably invalidates everything I just said. Again just my opinion.
---
So is mine, lol.
---
Survivors have faster vaulting. In the case where multiple windows spawn next to each other, ACTUAL infinite loops can exist where a 115 killer cannot catch up, either due to slower vaulting or due to needing to go around the window (negating the faster speed). In some cases like the swamp, 4 windows can spawn next to each other, making it immune to even Bamboozle. 
---
Fair is outsmarting and outplaying. Infinite loops are an exploit where a survivor is 100% safe.
---
Hopefully they make a larger minimum distance between the gates

After the nurse there gonna become the worst killers in the game so there is not much point. I would just save up shards its not worth 4 quid.
---
It’s not themed off anything. My username is I_Fap_To_Murder. I played killer a lot, and my background image on my profile is Bill Cosby busting a fat nut.
---
Quality profile
---
i run to find it..coz it really is easy to find especially if u have small game
---
Pretty sure I've seen you as a survivor in my killer game
---
Love that
---
Wait, the killer can't hatch grab anymore? Where was that said because I totally missed that.
---
Also, it is good for setting up traps as Hag or Trapper. Allows you to set ups traps in the tucked away areas that survivors take cover in.
---
With Legion getting nerfed and the Collapse is happening, looks around time to become a pig main.
---
good. deep wound got nerfed due to the terror radius thing
---
Sorry, do you want to face a Omega Blink Nurse ? Or a Prayer Beads Spirit ? Or a Iridescent Head Huntress ?
---
Sincerely, I see more Spirits than Billies at rank 1. Maybe because a good Billy still can be looped, unlike Spirit. Or because Spirit is more THICC than Billy ? In high ranks, all I hear are Nurse's screams and "wooooosh". And sometimes you don't hear anything. Then, suddenly, a Spirit comes at your back and grab your ass. She get a free hook ( and she will get free hooks all the game ) and you can't gen rush her, because she got Surveillance most likely.
---
You saying nurse is a bad killer ?
---
You can open gates and unhook in Madness 3. I assume the unhooking one was made as an exception so the Doctor can't just camp the person to death while sitting around building Madness.
---
Oooo small world. What killer were you? And was i playing Jeff, David, or Jane?
---
Damn that sucks, I wad legitimately excited to try them. Thank you for the heads up though!
---
In Friday the 13th Jason is slower than survivors and he has to use abilities to catch them or wait for them to lose stamina, he gets bullied a lot :((
---
I just have a question. So if ur the last survivor and the killer closes the hatch, wut then? Does it reopen after a certain amount of time? Do we have to reopen it similar to the 20 second gates? Does all gens instantly power up and let us open exit gates instead? Or are we just dead since we can't do gens to power exit gates? I am the confusion
---
Lower ranks I usually get placed with either stay after a good skill check or run away and hide in a locker. Pretty common for me at least.
---
You looking for real advice? Or the, “get gud” advice?
---
Linkage
---
When did it say they van open gate?
---
I want this as an actual thing now.
---
You need to watch the video again.
---
Yeah, they're giving killer counterplays to survivor end game and indirectly buffing all of their end game perks like bloodwarden and noed. Everyone asked for game mechanics to be changed so that survivors weren't holding m1 on gens as their main objective, but this doesn't address that.
---
I meant to safe nurf sorry
---
Not really a contradiction. The killers under point 1 have absolutely no way of dealing with it innatelyl, while Trapper usually can't but can if he's lucky.
---
Trapper can get around MoM if he's able to grab them out of a trap, since that will save Trapper two hits.
---
Theoretically, he counters MoM.
---
In practice, it's fairly uncommon for a survivor to actually step into a trap at high ranks, so he's countered by MoM unless he gets lucky and the survivor doesn't look down.
---
The obvious solution would be to make Blood Warden freeze the Collapse timer.
---
More likely that Dwight's mortal shell wouldn't hold such power.
---
ffs say\*
---
The actual end game can only be triggered by either survivors powering the gens, or 3 survivors getting murdered. Watch it again. The early end game was forced to demonstrate it.
---
No more balance or neat gameplay ideas added on perks, please BHVR no. Really though, the bad gate distance rng and ease of patrolling on speedy killer has to be addressed for the end game collapse.
---
Mami Myers can get it
---
True, but most of the time survivors start together and they are quickly snapped out of it. I have only ever gotten a hit out of it once. In my experience, it becomes a 10 second Object or Obsession for locating someone.
---
I would like it if they vaulted over it in normal conditions, but it doesn't, so its just terror radius and no deep wound decay on its own
---
Wondering why all three lights on the gate where on when patrolling them when I get completely rushed as killer it's to counter BW. Wow.
---
I know some of you run to find the totem. This is directed at those who think the killer is coming for them. Thanks for the feedback though.
---
Probably kicking.
---
Sorry to hear about that
---
To camp the chest down just a little bit.
---
How is that name even allowed lol
---
If killer doesn't see it, the teabag doesn't count
---
Are scratch marks covered up by all the floor lava?
---
I’m sure it’ll get reported eventually :( but until then &gt;:)
---
I could see it happening if they see the overlap of DbD communities and Drag communities. Also, "Came To Slay" as the chapter name would be a fucking mood.
---
do you know how many red ranks I go against that actually play to have fun in the game? It's about sportsmanship, not about you killing someone. It's how you do it that makes the game fun or not fun for a survivor. It doesn't require real skill to tunnel someone to death. What requires skill is actually keeping them off the gens while you hunt them all down, one by one. 
---
There are 2 ways to play this game. 
---
1. Everyone has to die as soon as the game starts, there is no room for fun, fun does not exist.
---
2. Having fun while chasing people, showing the skills you have learned about your killer.
---
I watch many top tier killer streamers who still make the games fun for everyone, even if they do it in a lethal way. You do not have to play like a D-bag just to win the game. There is more to this game than just get in, kill, and on to the next game. Why anyone thinks the only objectives in the game is either do gens or kill is beyond me. Even the emblem systems requires you to chase people, and the less time you spend near a hook, the more points you get on it. Yet, killers still do that, then complain that it's the survivors fault that all the gens got done while they focused on one survivor.
---
The mechanism could be like the R6 Siege's cameras, and, even with Calm Spirit, you would be able to see the survivor and at least have an ideia of where he is (not everytime, i know, because the map have corners etc).
---
true 3 minutes seems short, but you gotta figure gens only take 80 seconds to complete. What makes them seem longer is when the killer is constantly applying pressure. People going down pausing the timer will significantly slow down the game, but on the other hand, if noone is going down, why isn't anyone leaving. It's just one of those things we'll have to play out and see how it feels. And they can always tweak numbers later. Can't fret over the small variables of it.
---
The downfall with this is that you only see a splay and not an aura. You cannot easily tell if someone is nearby or far away. Someone could be across the building or 50 meters away on the other side of the map. 
---
This becomes more useful when one or two people are sacrificed or on hooks.
---
Survivors did use to be OP and a lot of the nerfs they received were removal of bullshit that attracted a lot of legitimate complaints (infinite windows, pallet towns, gen 99ing, DS...), but this seems like going too far in the other direction - and in fact favouring still remaining bullshit elements such as the mentioned NOED and impossibly close exit gate spawns. There's also still that issue where the winrates are notably tilted with survivors continuing to dominate the lower ranks, and killers thrashing them in the higher ones (numerically). Meanwhile, survivor BP generation still *sucks*, and it's *not* the perma-top-tier players that have the greatest need for BP, but are more likely to have a lot of good stuff already.
---
Addressing killer bullying definitely is a good intention, but at the cost of making them the OP side now?
---
You have a small hope of escaping instead of the guaranteed hatch escape that survivors have now. I'm very happy about this.
---
Ruin is excellent for survivors that need objective points. All the regression makes the gen not get completed as fast, giving y’all more time to amass more points, leaving less people with bronze objective at best
---
The problem here, and it's not just this thread but a very common sentiment: Having the 5th generator completed doesn't mean you've "lost" as a killer. It just means the game has entered its final stages.
---
Especially with the end game changes announced, it's very obvious BHVR considers the post-5th Generator time frame as its own unique part of the match. 
---
The game isn't over and the killer hasn't won or lost until all the survivors are dead or have escaped. They've gone the whole match using less power in their kit in return for the trade off of being stronger in this end game scenario that is now being more fleshed out by BHVR
---
What I like to do is pretend I respect pallets, until they try and punish me for it and boom free hit
---
Console is much better. More work to be done, sure. But it's noticeably nicer and my PS4 is like five years old.
---
Legion has built in anti-immersion...
---
The knew hatch mechanic is supposed to favor whoever finds it first.
---
And close exit gate spawns only happen on small levels like the game. Like people were telling me about the Legion nerf: play it before your criticize.
---
Fuck no.
---
Doing dull totems plays around 1 perk that you don't know if your opponent has.
---
It's bad but the other maps are amazing
---
I saw that the killer could close the hatch and I got SUPER angry because they should never be able to do that. Then I saw that if they close the hatch then the exit gates get powered. That seems balanced, good trade off IMO.
---
Yeah my PS4 is a day 1 PS4 and I logged in today and I noticed it’s wayyyy better. It’s not a smooth as PC, but it’s better.
---
I would absolutely flip my shit if a DbD character showed up in MK11.
---
Lol. Can’t wait for dedicated servers.
---
Ok so I'm kind of confused on the whole hatch mechanic now. When does the hatch spawn? Is it always open now? If that's the case, what's stopping survivors from just running around looking for it, then escaping?
---
Then shouts his signature catchphrase: “You just got Trapped!”
---
I heard that "A hatch will spawn regardless of how many gens have been powered up if only one survivor is remaining".
---
90% sure Jane. I don't remember what killer I was because I play all killers equally. Psn is black hippie though.
---
I don’t understand
---
Completely agree. Also if you cant necessarily see survivors you can still make guesses from how loud they are when they are hurt or working on generators.
---
Bruh. You can't be serious.
---
Ya know I think I did run into you. I dont think I survived that game.
---
Except you don’t get good skill check points when ruin is up. But I get what you’re saying
---
If the collapse has like 1 minute left they’re fucked
---
It starts when the hatch is closed or when a gate is opened.
---
I know its lame to ask a game dev for QOL stuff.  But could we have a change for Small Game that shows the aura of what it highlights?  Versus the hag or trapper, it becomes nigh impossible to determine what you're pinging, so it would be nice if it briefly flashed the aura to show us what we detected.  It also sorta sucks when you swing your camera over a multi-level area and it pings, and you cant determine which floor the trap/totem is on.
---
That, and/or a totem counter...?
---
you know you could just run BBQ and go *find* the survivor instead of camping, right? you'll get more points and probably actually pip, too.
---
All of them are running unbreakable
---
easy enough for the killer to move side to side or forward or back a bit and dodge your timer idea though
---
and even if the devs programmed it perfectly so it couldnt be tricked
---
30 seconds is 1/6 of time a survivor has before they die thats still alot
---
At least recruit on attack can use frag grenades.
---
In terms of chases he is a bit better than a standart m1 killer due to the obvious instadown and almost instant pallet break if you happened to charge the chainsaw
---
There's so much to love about these new changes. I can't wait to see them in action for myself.
---
they all try very hard on ps4
---
(Pre nerf decisive btw)
---
Killers: can i counter your decisive?
---
Surviors: i have to use it 
---
NoED
---
Survivors: can i counter you Noed?
---
Killers: destroy totems
---
Survivors: no thanks
---
The only reason to buy Legion at this point would be for their perks, if you want them. They aren't worth real money anymore, buy Legion with shards.
---
I have the deepest sympathy for your parents. Those poor lads.
---
That perk sucks even if you don't memorize the totem locations. 12m is way too short
---
it has been 100% survivor sided for hatch standoffs. now i don't have a problem if it's killer sided.
---
With them fucking up sounds,emblems,the DC issues and so on. This game isn't ready for that.
---
And everyone is asleep.
---
Summer
---
Check the pinned post on this sub
---
Ohh I’ve played against you before! Didn’t know you changed your name
---
yes i heard pig was getting reworked a bit though other wise she could just patrol jigsaw boxes for 3 minutes to win ez ( they havent said what the rework is though yet)
---
my solution is to get rid bodyblocking  as a strategy on healthy survivors during end game, it would be a silly cheese if it made it into the game as it is now
---
and you got dress add-ons
---
My bad I thought he said somewhere in there that it couldn’t be closed I watched it again and was wrong. After all why wouldn’t he be able to close it after there’s only one survivor that’s the whole point of this duhhh. Brain fart
---
I can agree with you if you're talking about the 62FPS cap and Frame Drops etc. They should have been the first thing to focus on when they launched the game. Not to mention not having dedicated servers yet.
---
However, if it helps, there is an easy fix for the optimization tho.
---
You can manually modify the in-game settings from a config file, which does nothing else than lowers the game settings more than you are normally able to.
---
This does not give the user any advantage in-game, since the graphics will simply be lower resolution at long distance, and they will fully render once you're a bit closer to them. It makes a huge difference tho.
---
People talk about how they can get banned by EasyAntiCheat, but this is not the case. You're only unlocking your FPS and changing the default values of the In-game settings below minimal. Not directly modifying the game files.
---
If I remember correctly, a dev even commented that they do not actively seek users using these settings, but they won't help if you modify the wrong files and EAC bans you.
---
Tl;dr: don't fuck up and you're fine. It's really easy, so messing it up is hard.
---
[Here is a tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LFGTQYlGL8)
---
The optimization update (which is coming with the Dedicated servers later this year) should also fix performance issues so manual tweaking of the settings **SHOULD** no longer needed by then.
---
-----
---
My GPU is 1060 6GB @2100MHz and CPU Ryzen 7 1700 @3.8GHz. I get about 120-180 FPS on average and it has never dropped below 80FPS. It rarely drops under 100FPS.
---
If you're playing on console, then wait for a few months and it should be fixed.
---
Holy shit this is game changing. I might have to come back after over a year absence.
---
BHVR wants that Marvel hype.
---
This is fine. It's just like being blocked into the basement to wait out BT, RBT, DS, etc. In fact, this is good for survivors as well, since there's no more being blocked into a corner and having to wait for one of you to DC to end the game.
---
If I get another Legion today...
---
IDC.  Spank me daddy trapper!
---
Personally I don't like the change of it. I mean yeah games will end a bit faster but it's just promoting camping some poor guy at the end and force his friends to leave him. Hopefully it doesn't go through but I get this feeling it will.
---
This is a shit post right? Killers are tired of seeing adrenaline, self care, MoM every game but it’s whatever
---
I literally am playing really bad if I ever need to heal more than twice, and if you want you can run ace in the hole, and probably get 3 or 4 heals out of it, I just run it with botany knowledge because if I were healing more than twice with self care, I am completely screwing over my team, when I could've just been doing generators
---
I see where you’re coming from but honestly you should try distortion. Also try to learn how to bamboozle the killer that’s using bbq without having to waste time hiding in a locker. Also practice the hex skill checks. I used to waste time trying to find the hex and when you don’t play swf, literally everyones running around trying to find it instead of doing gens. I’ve learned to just carry a toolbox and practice them hex skill checks and hopefully one person is on the look out for the hex while you’re working on the gens. Hopefully this helps
---
Bloddwarden.
---
I personally love going to all the maps, except the swamp, fuck the swamp.
---
You can jump it one extra time? Or it is an infinite. What if you jump it injured do you go into the dying state.
---
Be honest, did you get face camped within 10 games of posting this?
---
Entity: I got you fam

3 vaults and its blocked. should just be happy it gets blocked at all tbh

Gotta keep my BloodPressure low.. :)

---
&gt;CAN THE KILLER OPEN THE EXIT GATES AT ANY POINT IN THE TRIAL, OR ONLY ONCE THE GENERATORS ARE POWERED?
---
The Killer can only open the gates when the generators have been powered.
---
If I hit a good while ruin is active and my teammate is on the gen with me, o get off the gen in an act of shame and proceed to look for the totem. I know it doesn't give the killer a notification
---
I watched it like 4 times lol. Must've just slipped my mind
---
I FUCKING CAN'T STAND CLOWNING S AND BILLYS, EVERY DAMN TIME THEY'RE EITHER TUNNELING ME OR FACECAMPING THE ENTIRE ROUND, EVEN THEN, THEY SEEM WAY TO FAST WITHOUT BLOODLUST
---
Timer needs to be shortened to 2 minutes, 3 minutes is long, and with someone down/hooked that changes it to 6 minutes. That is WAY too long.
---
Best explanation I've seen till now 🤷‍♀️
---
I don't get this sub sometimes man
---
Let me just ruin this shit real fast
---
Survivors don’t like dying, Killers don’t like not killing. The hatch is an unhealthy mechanic because you can’t balance it to make both sides happy. I think this is by far the healthiest way to handle it that has come up so far though

Probably yes. From my site i can only say thats screenshot is not fake.
---
They said only "Remember me" will be changed.  Hooking someone with 45 s left will be a GG, and amazing to watch as killer.
---
Maple#9977
---
A bunch of boosted ass killermains not wanting to do anything that takes skill.
---
If she looks away and is in stealth mode it doesn't count as a chase. People sometimes do it to get the pig RBT kills daily done.
---
Fuck does that even mean?
---
I'm saying how funny it will be when this does happen.
---
Ew
---
My problem with this is that altruism at the end is just gone. No one is going to save because they want to gtfo instantly. The good part to this is that it makes way more intense if you get caught in a chase and everyone is gone, I feel like this update is going to have lots of problems and mixed feelings but it could be fun depending on how they pull it off
---
Finally some good duking food
---
Why do survivors get health state perks but not killers again?
---
Why did you do this?
---
Yes, having diversity in killers and what they excel at is a good thing. We don't that here. What we have here is yet another killer that can't end chases.
---
Oh, I’d test but I don’t want to get ban for glitching the game.
---
I love when killers face camp that’s a free 2 gens. If he camps me I just chill and hope my team does their gens and escapes.
---
BAN SURVIVORS FOR USING PALLETS
---
I’m so tired of the DS is equal to NOED cause it’s really really really not. You know what is equal to NOED? Adrenaline, both completely ignore a health state, I don’t have a problem with either I use both. But I’m really fucking tired of survivors blaming killers for NOED because they didn’t do the totems.
---
Uh why?
---
I think they should make it to where you have to complete one more gen and then the hatch appears.
---
for killers confused on how unlocking the gates by closing the hatch is good, think of it like this i find hatch first with like 5 gens done, i wait for survivor to find it, close it, and chase them, now the survivor has to escape me AND open a gate so now hatch standoffs have been nulled out
---
Added you :)
---
going into stealth mode get rid her hit box for a few seconds she would have to corner them while crouched
---
and lets say it is possible to bear trap them kill them while blocking them in she has to down them first and use a limited power on them, your saying it would be fair to give the ability unique to pig to all killers? 
---
just because the pig can do it a great cost all killer should get it for free? yea no thank you
---
What if someone they knew died or had a really bad accident? Are you just going to be like "yeah, one sec! I know Grandma died, but it's not nice to DC in this game, I'll he there in a bit".
---
Thanks for the link!! Weird how they left that sort of unclear in the big announcement.
---
Dude, if a face camper gets more than two kills, most of the time only 1 tbh, it’s the survivor’s fault. Do gens while they camp so they get punished for it. Besides, the sec d they make it a bannable offense people are going to report meme’ing Leatherface players in the basement and people who camp hooks once the exit gates are powered.
---
Maybe I’m a masochist but that sounds pretty fun feomma survivor standpoint. Very frantic
---
Good change. The only things I may be worried about is the red Marks everywhere obscuring scratch Marks and I'm not so sure the timer needs to be slower based on downs and hooks if it is 3 minutes long. 3 minutes is a really long time.
---
Still the overall idea seems ok. Now if the survivors wont go they will be forced to leave. Also it makes endgame builds more viable because if you run blood warden that is 1/3rd of the time for collapse. Imagine what could you do with remember me and closing the hatch?
---
Reddit isn’t any better tbh
---
No. Deal with it. The ends justify the means. It's not as though killers aren't punished for it anyway--ever heard of the Chaser Emblem?
---
Not necessarily that scenario exactly, but I have seen situations where 2 players both want the hatch and they stall the game
---
cause being able to loop killer shack window and jungle gyms 5 times is exactly what we need /s
---
Because survivors get rewarded for completing their objectives. Killer get rewarded for failing to do their objective.
---
at 0:26
---
I agree with all of that. They’re just not good at balancing this game and they always over correct.
---
I honestly hope they can find away around it.  
---
The effects look awesome as all hell but god not being able to see the scratch marks at all is gonna be rough.
---
Killers can now open an exit gate once they're powered. So a killer can initiate the collapse if, let's say, two survivors remain and none of them are attempting to touch a door.
---
Hopefully I explained that ok.
---
And there are no pallets
---
Pig: *Crouches*
---
Wraith: *moans*
---
Down someone close to gates. 
---
Open gate and start the collapse. 
---
Hook the downed survivor and trigger bloodwarden.
---
Laugh.
---
Yeah but I don’t really want to hear that shit in my ear all game
---
Somewhere in the entity's realm the nurse is crying
---
You should really watch the video lol it explains everything, there's a post on this subreddit with the video. Around 0:29 into the video it says this
---
Can you still open the Hatch with a key after the Killer closes it?
---
Yeah, I thought the same thing until the post, it would've been interesting.
---
Please, somebody help the man... He's already suffered enough with the incominf Legion nerf!
---
Also NOED can be cleansed
---
I am just hoping his rework will bring him back from the dead honestly.
---
I recommend Class Photo if you're doing a Endgame build, at the very least if they had addie you'll know where everyone is so you can re-sleep em.
---
The problem is that when you're being "Gen Rushed" how do you stop it? Here's a little bit of education for you: If you are in an SWF, you split up and do 1 Generator Each, one of you will be found, the rest do gens, I guarantee that 3 Gens will be done before or just as The Killer catches you. Ruin makes this less likely to happen, BBQ helps you pick your next target.
---
There are builds you can do without these, but these mostly likely require specific killer Addons or a specific map. These are pretty much Jack of All trades perks.
---
I am not discussing this, but I am telling you: Spirit with Prayer Beads, Billy with most of his Addons and Nurse is almost any capacity, are the only effective killers who can even think to stand a chance against a full Gen Rush, SWF or not, without these Perks. With them? It makes it a hell of a lot more able to do so, some killers outright require these perks to be given a chance at higher ranks, and let's not forget about that most M1 Killers (Not Nurse or Legion) I play against run either Enduring/Bamboozle or Enduring/Spirit Fury, because they need to end chases quick to be given even a *chance* against this shit. You clearly do not play Killer and have no idea how bad it is for Killers to do their job, especially against good Survivors.
---
You see the perks because inherently, games are too quick and can be completed too quick. BHVR simply cannot extend the time it takes to heal or gen repair time any longer before it becomes unbearable for The Survivors.
---
I can't change your mind, it is really good
---
There's even those DOOOOONG noises that intensify the "FORGET ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS THEY ARE LEFT FOR DEAD, JUST RUN!!!" thing
---
Its actually both good for survivor and killer if the gates are open so killer should open them yea :D I will be running hope a lot more now.
---
Sounds like the bih guy needs to stay away from the spray paint.
---
WAIT THEY DID?
---
So you still have one minute to leave not to mention implying current Freddy is t the same as his rework, you can still manage that and if Freddy downs or hooks someone, you get more time. Plus he can still only chase one person so everyone else needs to pressure that door open or try to force themselves awake.
---
I had Sidney Prescott name but there i will have Dwight Fairfield
---
Face camping is a legitimate tactic. We all use it and get those 4ks and now with endgame we will get the 4ks forever. Deal with it scrub.
---
No salt without pepper man
---
I dont want to hear about blood warden being op after this. I've always ran it on freddy and I will always run it on everyone now.
---
adam already looks so sweaty...
---
Daddy Myer's succulent body can not be beat
---
You know you can just... look away... or crouch, right?
---
So pretty much 3 survivors can DC immediately for the hatch to spawn for the last survivor!!!!!!
---
My favorite part of the update is how you can absolutely deny survivor toxicity if you get stomped as killer. Just open a gate yourself and retreat to the basement or wherever the hell and the survs are forced out in 3 minutes. Plenty of time to heat up a hot pocket or smth
---
WHATS GOING ON HERE
---
Indeed and you know what? I think that's fair. If End Game Collapse has started and you choose to go into the basement save someone who got hooked...that's on you. You are "agreeing" to take the risk that you might get blocked in and killed. The basement is the killer's domain.
---
Survivors will just have to realize that with this new setup, you cannot necessarily save everyone anymore.
---
From what I can tell, if you still have 3 generators to complete but the hatch is open and the killer closes it, that's what starts it.
---
This looks good, looks like something i thought a while ago
---
You can jump windows and avoid all damage, will cause exaustion, and will block that window for you until the chase ends
---
(It's like dead hard but you jump the window kinda rool dodging)
---
Except the emergency thing because real life &gt; a video game.
---
At least we can respect noot noot recruit
---
Most end game perks are so obnoxious on killers, save Remember Me. Unlike survivor end game perks killer always gets to endgame even when they play poorly, and their perks are super strong with most of them requiring little to nothing to activate. I hope they rework NOED with this massive killer buff.
---
Holy shit the end cracked me up
---
Freddy isn't really geared towards end game, his perks are.
---
The bih guy sounds like fun
---
Its fucking brutal, it stabs you everywhere including in the head.
---
Exactly
---
RIP recruit barbwire spam strats.  But really, power rangers is the real way to exert your dominance on the enemy team
---
I want to be sacrificed after seeing this
---
Remember me probably wont matter that much because an exit has to be opened for the collapse to start.
---
I mean to be fair...complaining that you cant get an escape when you've clearly lost the game with 3 people dead and the hatch being closed isnt exactly a compelling argument.
---
That's like if I were to argue that "well all the gens got powered and there are 4 survivors alive, they are all too good to get a hit on but I still deserve to get one person sacrificed"
---
That would be unfair yes?
---
If you dont find the hatch first, the gates are powered, and the gates are close enough for a high mobility killer to get to before you can make significant progress I would honestly just say take your loss because you could have looked for the hatch before the last person besides you got sacrificed. She cant even grab you out of the animation.
---
This. People need to learn that they can't, nor should they be able to, save everyone all the time.
---
You are not done till you get 69420
---
Yeah I will re-watch it, thanks for the explaining tho
---
Especially if paired with the length increasing add-ons, coupled with the fact deep wound is going to get a duration increase...
---
Well, the ban likely won't be permanent so the reward outweighs the risk .
---
People who play legion don't care about other people's fun so it's expected.
---
Wait what?
---
as much as i like both games, i don't like this really much. perhaps a pd logo shirt for some survivor
---
If you miss your ds, it doesn't immediately go away
---
Also an accurate representation of rank 20s vs. Bloodwarden
---
Once again making it so killer barely have to play the game. Everything the last couple patches have been to buff killers why should it count as a kill for them?
---
Michael Myers is always cute.
---
Saltier than the Dead Sea. I love it. You can't throw enough pepper at this manchild.
---
ooh thats actually a good idea to work with. Within a 10/20/30 (subject to change ofc) of a hooked survivor, Noed does not affect survivors
---
Just had this happen...
---
It may be useable if you see two+ items.
---
Exactly. I'd rather lose a game where I actually play and try to improve my mindgames, than lose a game where I stare at a guy on a hook forever. This game is built around getting things done faster than the other side, one dictates the other. Survivors want gens done fast, in turn Killers want survivors hooked fast. My favorite games as Killer are when I can hook everyone 3 times, because those are the ones where some crazy shit goes down. Also survivor games where all I do is gens and some other guy gets chased all game sucks... *I* wanna get chased :'(
---
I'm excited to try it all out myself. It's a shame so many people blindly hate on changes simply for bring changes. Without trying out different ideas the game will stagnate and die off, change and evolution keeps it fresh and exciting!
---
But legion doesn’t have any fans...
---
Only self care from that list. Occasionally balanced landing.
---
This is well made. Good job!
---
How is it pointless? It lets you accurately know what the survivors are bringing sans one item unless they also burn a coin offering. The value of this varies, but it significantly lowers the chances of getting surprise flashlighted or keyed, so you can't say that it does nothing for the killer.
---
See also: Having one survivor hooked in the basement while you're being looped in the shack by another.
---
Apparently that's camping.
---
Maybe it should be a feature, no scratch marks after the collapse.
---
HYPER POWERED LEVEL PULLING
---
Ty been getting into drawing chibi recently.
---
This is actually my preferred body type
---
Might stalk some survivors later, idk yet.
---
I think you should still get them, even though they will suck, they take a lot more skill to use now, and some more practice if you like the grind more than the endgame. However they'll still be viable, with their location awareness and game slowing ability
---
This is brilliant. Also plus points for goth Jeff.
---
Best Jeff.
---
Goth jeff is love
---
We already have too many daddy killers smh
---
I know the bbq counter and how to work through ruin. All I am saying is it would be nice to see some variety. Yes I mostly play survivor but I use all of the non-licensed characters and I switch up my perks often. The only constant is self-care if I have it.
---
I watched tru3talent YouTube spirit videos.  
---
Helped me a lot
---
What you wanna start doing is getting used to the timing on guaranteed blinds like when they break a pallet then once comfortable with that uou can try and work the flashlight into other situations
---
But then the survivors could just run out the gate.
---
Exactly. So wouldn't you want to see a wider variety of perks?
---
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me, they could care less as long as someone will bleed
---
Mitty?
---
Well I'm guessing keys are going to be crutch/ALOT more useful now. Especially for those situations such as the one you mentioned. Hatch is close to a gate, gates are on the same wall side by side, and killer has noed. Killer closes hatch to force end game. Only viable way is escape via hatch using key I guess?:/
---
That means anyone who gets hooked in the basement when endgame starts is going to be impossible to save. Secure two kills at the end instead of one thats hooked. 
---
People already complain about being bodyblock locked in the end game cause of salty killers to force survivors disconnect. Now the greifers win.
---
I feel like the reason Freddy hasn't been reworked in so long is due to the awkward position he is in. For one,he is a literal God tier in rank 20s against extremely new survivors that don't understand his power. A butt would make him op in that rank. 
---
Secondly,much like Legion, there really isn't much they can do to buff him without making him the most annoying killer in the game.
---
I mean I guess that could be part of it, but it just seems like it’s crazy hard to land a bit with the flashlight. Maybe I’ll try taping a cross hair to my screen to see if that helps, I don’t really know what else to do. I don’t really care for the flashlight anyway since I’m pretty decent at losing the killer
---
I DEADASS DIDNT HEAR THE GENS POP WHILE IN CHASE. I ALSO HATE HOW THE CHASE MUSIC STARTS WHEN A PEICE OF SURVIVOR MEAT IS ON THE CORNER OF YOUR SCREEN
---
The Dead by Daylight official video at 0:33 - 0:38. All four survivors, four gens left.
---
The new mechanical only work if the exit gates are powered.
---
If someone is stuck in basement with a camping killer after the exit gates are open just leave.
---
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE GET TOO IMMERSED AND MAKES ME SAD. I HAD A MATCH AGAINST SOME CLAUDETTE MEAT AND I LEGIT DIDNT FIND HER THE WHOLE GAME AND SHE GOT TRAP DOOR. I WANT TO DIE.
---
This is exactly why I play how I like and don't follow silly survivor benefiting rules.
---
Ooooh, dude, that is developer's commands to show the countdown and stuff, it doesn't mean it is coming for the game, and the part I was referring to is the killer closing the hatch
---
Oooh My
---
Thanks buddy
---
How did you gather that OP was an entitled survivor main from their simple consideration? I swear to god this subreddit is filled so much with entitled, salty killer mains that like to antagonize survivors and make them seem overpowered even though they’ve been receiving gradual nerfs in favor of killers.
---
RIGHT IN THE ASS! LOL
---
not if Feral Frenzy is active. if the planned changes go through, stabbing a wounded survivor with it active now does nothing except stun Legion while giving the survivor a short speed boost. It doesnt even reduce the bleed out timer. and pallets can only be jumped by using feral frenzy.
---
:) no problemo
---
Oh, okay. Wasn't sure if it was just a thing for the vid or if killers would be able to just initiate the end game. Would have enjoyed that actually!
---
Then the others can open the gates and gtfo. Not much different from facecamping a hooked survivor.
---
“No wonder why Amanda loves this stuff...”
---
Had no idea this game was actually kind of popular.
---
I TRY MY BEST NOT TO TUNNEL OFF HOOK (MAYBE ONCE EVERY 50 GAMES, IF THAT) BUT WHEN I DO IT OUT OF FRUSTRATION FOR HOW SHITTY THE FRAMES ARE ON CONSOLE (RED FOREST), I GET THE MOST VILE HATEMAIL I'VE SEEN.
---
SO FUCK IT. GET TUNNELED. I CAN BE PART OF THE PROBLEM TOO. LET'S KILL THE GAME TOGETHER WITH OUR TOXICITY.
---
FUCK CONSOLE DBD.
---
In this case make hitting a survivor with a Power or M1 bannable! /s

B R U H  that's actually an amazing idea 
---
So many SWF groups will be torn apart by their own altruism (metaphorically, if they lack it, literally if they have it)... Sign me up ;)
---
Well, it could be a good mechanic, but killers would abuse :/, but I understood your point of view, and I agree:I would have enjoyed that too!
---
Orange. Dorito!
---
And this is what I'm talking about. The system I suggested would only allow for a Meg with adrenaline and self-care, but no mettle of man. Or a Nea with balanced landing and MoM but no self-care.
---
:/ Yeah usually that would be the case but in this case it is pretty safe to say that Legion is dead.
---
I WISH KILLER BM WAS AS FUCKING RECOGNIZED AS SURVIVOR BM. I FUCKING HATE IT WHEN KILLERS SMACK ME ON THE HOOK AND BULLY ME. YOU WON, I GET IT ASSHOLE.
---
Gotta be fake cuz ash would come next
---
I see 2 main issues.
---
1: Technically the killer can just camp the hatch and wait til they see the survivor, then kick it down and chase em as normal.  It is possible there can still be a hatch standoff just...  Much differently then it is now.
---
2: I feel like it being 3 minutes AND slows down on dying and hook AND starts after an exit gate is powered makes it too slow and only really stops teams from BM'n the killer more then anything, after enough time.  Considering how quick games tend to be on average 3 minutes feels like a long time with all of those other conditions.  I feel like either A: Lowering the time, B: Making it so it doesn't slow down, or C: It starts after the final gen.  One of those 3 things I think would change it to be perfect and extremely tense and really make people more run for their life instead of doing 24/7 altruism.
---
Of course I'll try it and this is definitely better then the previous system we had, it's nothing but an improvement, I just want to see a feeewwww tweaks to really make it perfect in my eyes.
---
Yeah, they mentioned before the endgame collapse video release that they were looking into it, and that what you said could be implemented to prevent 3 or less-man games.
---
The game's asymmetrical nature makes shit difficult enough to balance as it is.
---
Imagine the time and effort that'd be wasted reworking the entire perk system — only for both sides to screech in stunned horror.
---
I see what your saying and I get the frustration especially a dungeon camp. But If face camping is bannable than they should actually ban people who body block hooks... again it’s a strategy that’s used and it gives the survivors a chance to finish gens while he’s guaranteeing his one kill and losing out on the chance at 3 more. Also it helps in the game to know where a basement is early on and just avoid that part of the area and strategize which gens to get.
---
I could see it being a problem too. It'd screw survivors out of a ton of points which they get very little of anyway.
---
Have you considered stabbing then normally though? Like I said?
---
Just walking up and M1ing them like killers are supposed to do when not using their power? Killers with 115% movespeed are supposed to do that from time to time.
---
I'm really glad they're being responsive. Nothing devastates a community's trust more than silence. 
---
Thanks BHVR for everything lately!
---
just leave lol
---
I think you might have over skimmed the point of that post. When you just hear 3 minutes to leave, you might feel like it's not a lot of time. But the game gets drawn out from killer pressure. So it's not as short as it seems.
---
Yeah that's what this game needs as it takes longer and longer to find a match: less killers
---
Can someone translate the texts?
---
Can we have loading screens like this. It would be neat
---

---
Maybe it works
---
Which would make it balanced, killer can slug until near bleedout, proc BW and everyone dies
---
He's speaking the language of the gods
---
OOOOOOO KILL EM !
---
The only ones they can efficiently listen to are the ones that also submit a ticket.
---
Pig is going to be an endgame menace and I’m all for it.
---
Both. The Entity is getting stronger (and probably killed Benedict) and the since the Entity loves a good Trial it would get bored at the Claudette holding the game hostage.
---
Care to explain why? I'm rather curious about this, I do believe this could show the Entity is growing ever stronger/tired of survivors japing killers
---
weeb.
---
Beat me to it, lmao I thought the same thing
---
Why? Obviously body blocking to stop the game indefinitely is bannable, but body blocking to wait out a timer is perfectly valid. In this case, body blocking someone so wraith can decloak and get a hit is bannable
---
Stock up on your keys girls.
---
True.
---
"Nerf"
---
So darken your prose, I'll strike a violent pose, they better leave you alone but not me.
---
Mermaid man dies in endgame
---
Why is pig scarier?
---
It's the Entity getting tired of the survivors' shenanigans. It doesn't want them to continue doing the shit they've been doing, like teabagging in the killer's face for 10+ minutes during the endgame.
---
Well we aren’t gonna get this lol. I expect the Collapse to use the same instruments and theme used in the dying and injured state. Maybe even the killer theme song in the menu. That guitar would be awesome for the whole impending doom thing.
---
So is this a permanent new feature? or just a temp fun new gamemode?
---
You know, I really like this. I play survivor mostly but play killer when load times are ridiculous (aka all the time lol). They thought outside the box here and I really think this solves a ton of issues. Just the other day I sacrificed three with one survivor still left and looked for them for 15 minutes. They didn’t do any gens. Finally downed them and they DC’ed.
---
not true, the killer can still get them in those situations. You clearly just aren't good enough. Im sure faster vaulting has nothing to do with anything considering the killer can just loop around and get them.
---
The Bih guy is an idiot
---
Goddang the funniest memes ever are dbd memes 😂
---
And you're a racist
---
Man, this is impressive. Do we really need to do this shit? I'm here trying to have a discussion about a thing that annoys me every day, and I'm getting either a troll or a super salty killer who's assuming shit. I just want to play the game, and do so in a way that's fun for everyone. I don't play 4 man swf because it is op as all hell and not fun to play against, and it's not always feasible to run those perks. Dead hard is buggy as hell on console and us casual players haven't had time to unlock MOM yet. I can't exactly get randoms to bring borrowed time and even if they do it doesn't do much against a killer that doesn't give up. I don't really care about escaping, I just want to play a round where I actually get to play the game and don't get punished for not having the chance to gain emblem points. Let's not turn this into a "SURVIVORS ARE ALL TOXIC ASSHOLES WITH OVERPOWERED CRUTCH PERKS WHO GET ALL SALTY IF THEY LOSE" thread.
---
This actually sounds super killer sided and it hurts a little. Yes I’m glad they can put an end to the long games that don’t end because survivors don’t leave. But there are legitimate games where I need more than 3 minutes to figure things out without stalling. I don’t know how much it slows down the timer but endgame hooks sound like you might as well be dead. Pig sounds even stronger now because of traps and following people around so they can’t play any objective and will lose (situational of course).   
---
I feel like there should be more time on the clock depending on the length of the match. A shorter match would equal more than 3 minutes on the timer. And after a certain point only 3 minutes can be gained.   
---
Also Remember me, blood warden and NOED get hidden buffs. I’m glad killers are getting more and more power but this timer seems pretty bad
---
Ah but see here's the kicker.
---
He was born in 1972.
---
He's 47
---
Homophone, go back to Canada
---
I love this.
---
Should reduce some toxic behaviors.
---
So basically a discount Doc and a bunch of spelling errors?
---
I have this issue too, been searching for a fix do a while. No clue what causes it.
---
Then they die.
---
They really can’t do anything about dc when a lot of time the game it’s self disconnects you
---
There's always someone lying in wait in order to cry "toxic" now-a-day. Right up there with hate trains, review bombs, racists, sexists, etc...
---
At least people respect recruit mains.
---
I'd like to see Candyman, ghostface, or the creeper.
---
I dunno the survivors don't have to mend the entire game because of the terror radius.
---
I mean that sounds like shit :(
---
It's detective TrappGod from here on out
---
Ghostface and Sidney please
---
