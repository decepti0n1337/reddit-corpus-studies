Plz no I.have those survivor perks QnQ
---

---
Also Landing was in Shrine this week, I don't think it'll be there again
---
---
---
Well, then that's okay. I have no sympathy for toxic survivors. I'm glad you did that. Its just from only the video, you seemed to be the toxic one.
---
Just change collision in phase and put beads at ultra rare
---
Mad Grit and Iron Grasp. If they still break free you just got the whole team wounded. Fair trade IMO.
---

---
That doesn’t mean he has power. It means he doesn’t give a shit about what the Entity wants him to do.
---
Like a 3D auric cell would look cool , or any of the items like a medkit would be sick , imagine a little medkit for your desk and you could put a little LED switch light in it
---
You generally don’t but the trade off is you have four injured survivors and all in general close proximity.  Thats a huge win for a killer if they play it right and can lead the game to snowball. 
---
Nine times out of ten survivors bodyblocking just generally lead to one member of the team switching places with the original person who was on killers shoulders.
---
Best cosplay of my favorite killer in the game, well done!!
---
I wouldn't touch it, but if I had to nerf it, I would make it so it randomly chooses a totem at the beginning of the game (that isnt already taken) and will only light that one once the exits are powered if it is still up. That way, it stays hidden, but if you get most of the totems, you will likely not get NOED.
---
Perk: Here's Johnny! - pallet breakspeed is 100% faster
---
Ubi$oft
---
i hear this suggestion all the time. that will fix almost nothing.
---
I am interested in the game, any news of how the beta was?
---
Just wait until you lose 3 gens within a minute with ruin up and playing properly.
---
NOED is a safety net, Adrenaline is a reward. You did the objective optimally (or allowed other players to do the objective by looping) and you get a heal and a boost for it. I suppose you do fall back on it for the heal, but thats just because nobody heals you since youre expected to have adrenaline, if it didnt exist, youd just get healed by them
---
Also,if adrenaline didnt exist, thered just be way more self care (which is already the most used perk in the game), which is worse for both killers and survivors imo
---
The only nerf I could possibly imagine to it is not applying to people who are hooked when it activates, but it certainly isnt a weird baby perk
---
It’s almost as if someone like, say, Vigo did it. Seriously, though, look up the Hollowed Blight animation from BHVR. You’ll understand.
---
Thank you. If I have to be frank, the Dwight with the flashlight was a pain in my ass. I was Rank 8-9 before my two week hiatus and rank reset. Also, with new Decisive, I refrain from tunneling.
---
I spent cash on Hag but on PS4, her torso freezes the game for us everytime she lays a trap.
---
Swf, was trying to hook somebody and other three teammates blocked the hook. So is that an intended feature? I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get off six hits before the guy I'm carrying Wiggles free.
---
Prepare for the people that are like “jUsT dO bOnEs”
---
i really like the swamp map with the big boat what is that one called
---
How does a good killer get off six hits before somebody can wiggle free? Swf with three teammates blocking hook while I was carrying somebody. They didn't care about taking one hit.
---
Lmao. It literally keeps telling me I don’t have an internet connection while PS4 is doing perfectly fine on everything else and modem is stable.
---
Still waiting for the stackable add-on that makes your bell 300% and 200% louder.
---
What's the counter when three people are blocking a hook and I'm carrying someone?
---
Then drop the guy and people will most likely run and you can hook the guy
---
If you don't 3 gen that map as a killer you are fucked
---
its basicly a mix of violent coughing and laughing, kinda like he just got told a joke whilst sipping cheap scotch
---
Spirit is fine 
---
She is strong and should stay strong, just as every killer should aim to be...  she’s not op but a strong killer
---
Prayer beads I could understand a tweak. But leave her base alone...
---
ESO is patiently waiting right beside y'all
---
Can’t tell if you are memeing or not
---
Fine then, not balanced landing, urban evasion instead.
---
I believe they said the length of the event won't be altered it's just pushed back (thankfully).
---
I'm talking about three survivors blocking a hook when I'm the killer carrying someone.
---
Not at all?
---
Three survivors blocking the hook as I'm carrying someone who don't care about taking one hit each. Not sure how I'm supposed to get off six hits before the person Wiggles free.
---
I disagree with Myers.  I don’t think he would care at all and just continue to stalk you as he would
---
I just love how Ghostface sounds like "This fucking shit again."
---
I feel like its just his personality. Literally everyone is toxic. Otz can joke around sometimes but he often admits it when his opponents make a good play and generally accepts it when he gets outplayed instead of instantly getting salty which is quite appealing surprisingly.
---
hit your console a couple times and say ‘bad’ over and over again. Worked when my headset was being ass, then I just pulled a Chris Brown and slammed it against the stand my tv sits on. Works perfectly now
---
Actually tried that but didn't work for some reason. Not sure if everybody being so close didn't leave them place to drop so wouldn't let me or something.
---
What counter?
---
Edit: oh you meant like how to deal with it, not a ticking down counter. Just stab them like the person who replied to me said
---
I mean....   you probably should lol
---
Fuck man it's such a shame that you can't get these every game :(
---
Fuck I forgot about him
---
Honestly this is just disappointing. Why did they wait until the last minute to let everyone know about the delay?
---
the ones where chases arent reduced to 50/50 coinflip mindgames when they use their ability
---
Part of me really likes killer specific chase music, another part of me likes the surprise of not knowing the killer until I see it, and then a final part of me realizes part 2 only exists for like a minute at most lol.
---
* sarcastic *" BHVR... "*laugh track plays *
---
I usually just have a wank  when I’m  trying to load into a game.
---
I would love to see how Pyramid head would work, along with Jack since he doesn't really have many powers but he could be interesting.
---
F
---
New Survivor: Nohbdy
---
I don’t mind it either. Someone gets stabbed, sometimes I get a hook. It makes the game more fun. As long I’m not getting butt danced and flashlight spammed by Neas, I won’t be mad.
---
yup
---
Everyone, you say? How about the licensed ones (excluding the ones who died on-screen). None of them died (except for, again, the ones whose pries explicitly say that they did die). Nobody knows what happened to them. They’re just... taken. Nobody knows how or why. They just simply cease to exist in their respective realms and re-exist in the Entity’s. It’s not unreasonable to think they’d have to die, though.
---
A comment I made somewhere else:
---
"Throughout all of the discussions that I have seen about Spirit, I think it's kind of hilarious that pretty much the entire DBD community has unified against Prayer Beads - like every time whenever I see someone discussing how to "balance" her (whether they are for/against nerfing her) they always say Prayer Beads are very unfair. They're that bullshit lol."
---
The beads wont do anything
---
Well they could do a couple different things if they wanted to he could be a straight up m1 killer with no terror radius and no red stain they could incorporate the ghosts of the hotel if they wanted  or do something like legion he dont have any powers aside from running fast and vaulting he is nothing or I should be saying they are nothing but normal ppl hell let Jack break walls with his axe lol
---
Stab them.
---
BHVR on drugs lately
---
Same, I got him a few weeks ago so I’m not too mad.
---
Creepy and accurate.
---
NOED is the weakest it's ever been in this game.  When it first came out it was just permanently on when an Exit Gate opened.  Now if you do 5 bones and earn 5k points you can prevent it from coming into play.
---
NOED is such an overrated perk: you can easily counter it as survivor if you take time to not focus only on a gen and break some bones.  And with a perk as powerful as Inner Strength out now, I really can't take any NOED talk seriously.
---
legion is practically the definition of m1 killer. they can use their ability to guarantee an injure and slow down the game with mending, and that's it. they have no other abilities to help them patrol, rotate and get downs. when you look at really good killers like billy and nurse, they both have abilities that help them patrol, rotate and end chases very well. nurse can blink and ignore most map tiles, and billy can instadown survivors. legion on the otherhand, gets first hits with little effort only to be genrushed and looped to hell because he has no other abilities to throw survivors off or end chases.
---
legion has very little and what he does have is very easy to play against. most players simply choose not to heal against legion as it wastes too much time, and this works very well, similarly to not cleansing against the plague. survivors basically deprive legion of their only ability and turn them into an easy to loop m1 killer. good killers like the aforementioned billy and nurse cant have their abilities deprived by how survivors play. you could argue that you shouldnt heal aginst billy as well so he doesnt get use out of his instadown, but that only makes chases quicker and removes opportunity for jukes and mind games. if a billy is trying to backrev you, getting into a locker is a great way to avoid it, as the cooldown post chainsaw will let you make distance and continue running him, as where if you didnt heal, billy would just m1 you.
---
i can see legion being very good at lower ranks because survivors cant loop well and being able to get a free first hit sounds great at first, but when you get into the purple and red ranks, they really start to lag behind
---
this.
---
Their post is wrong. I just got Pop from the Shrine.
---
Wrong.
---
We got Dark Devotion, Pop Goes The Weasel, Solidarity, And Sprint Burst.
---
Every post about spirit being broken is met with "u jUst dONt lIKe heR bc ShE iS sTROng" she is broken, nerf her and her addons.
---
I would pay more than I care to admit just for this to be added to the game.
---
Are we ignoring the other suggestion? I acknowledge the beads thing isn't big, it's why I also brought up collision.
---
Same here
---
Well, at least it has league of legends left as a friend.
---
How about no
---
What the hell is with ghost face versus Myers? I was nailing Myers, but GF, I’m knocked out of stealth constantly and can’t even sacrifice. How do I play him right? Aggressive? Hang back?
---
I don't see why that's something to shun him for, he lost something he earned, that also doesn't affect gameplay, cheated to get it back, and still got punished, what's the big deal?
---
There's been no confirmation of that one way or the other.
---
Haha!!! Yessss!!!
---
plague just doesn't agree eith the pipping system. she's perfectly serviceable otherwise.
---
Low effort troll, nobody bother responding
---
Billy
---
What if Jack's Prestige outfit wouldn't be him covered in blood but he would be covered in snow and ice
---
Yeah. I feel he is more annoyed than in pain
---
I mean the guy has had much much worse things happen with less of a groan
---
That's tomorrow. They posted event on Xbox
---
Yikes
---
This gave me a laugh thanks
---
Otz laughing hard is actually the best
---
Wait, the other offerings don't? The common ones that give +50% to objectives for example?
---
Meg’s got three great perks. She’s worth leveling to 40 anyway.
---
A perk that allows you to get out of a grab if you hit a semi-difficult skill check. It only activates if you were hooked in the last 60 seconds. 
---
____
---
Killers who suspect you or running it will sometimes leave you on the ground for 60 seconds so you can’t hit it. The act of leaving people on the ground and going for others can be referred to as slugging. 
---
Once you hit it you can’t use it again.
---
Lee would be so cool imo. I don’t get why people like shitting on what everyone wants as if doing that is going to make it possible/impossible.
---
Lol. Zak bagans next survivor.
---
Tfw you have Level 33 Meg and Sprint Burst is on Shrine :(

I'd just settle for the game telling me noed has activated as soon as the gen has been finished, rather than when my ass has been slapped. At least it'd mean I can prepare for it.

Semi-right. We got sprint burst.

What the fuck is legion?
---
Probably is no best. Depends what you want to do. Play stealth? Pig/Myers/Ghosty/Wraith. Play fast? Billy/Spirit. Slow the game down? Freddy/Plague/Pig/Hag. Mess with people in chases? Clown/Doctor/Trapper. 
---
The one I would say to avoid *as a killer to learn on* is Nurse. She’s great...in the right hands. She takes a long time to get used to though, and getting experience with her wouldn’t translate to other killers as much as Ghost-Pig or Hag-Demo for instance. Huntress is another one that is good/can be quite fun, but the great Huntresses are great more because of how they are with the hatchets than them just being great killers overall. 
---
I learned on Billy and haven’t looked back. Highly mobile with an insta-down. Pretty basic in chases/loops, so he’ll translate in that respect. I’d admit he isn’t the most fun overall though. His ability is great for playing the actual game but it’s not as fun as sniping someone with Huntress or sneaking up on people with Myers.
---
Basically yeah why the fuck all yall been starting this shit, they ain't touched her in moooooonnnntthhhssss, like since her fucking release. Just stop being so fucking shit, actually fucking annoying now
---
Exactly. Adrenaline is one of the best survivor perks in the game.
---
Those increase the "speed" (you get 50% more doing the same amount of work on a gen) at which you gain those specific points during the trial. So if youre expecting to be chased a lot, youd put on an objective one so you get more of those points in compensation. 
---
The only other offerings that grant post game points are the envelopes and event offerings
---
Hands down!
---
I will sing it if I've been playing for awhile and it freaks out my boyfriend so bad hah
---
Please tell me how to counter this killer, please enlighten me
---
Wow, I wrote that a long-ass time ago.  It would definitely need some changes due to game mechanics added after I wrote that (for instance **Little Pigs, Let Me Come In!** +  **Spirit Fury** + **Enduring** would be an utterly ridiculous combo that didn't exist when I made that because it was pre-Spirit and pre-Enduring tweak).  Thanks for the approval and the trip down memory lane!
---
I had a nea teabag a noed clown at the front of the exit. If you're gonna be an ass then dont be stupid and sit at the actual exit. Long story short the dumbass got downed and killed, karma's a bitch

---
ThAt is really cool I didn't think It would turn out good and I actually thought it was a real nurse keep up the good work
---
trapper
---
What about killer mains constantly getting their mains nerfed? Nurse didn’t need a nerf, just her add one. But because of entitled whiny survivors, we lost one of the best killers in the game. 
---
(this is coming from someone that plays killer and survivor almost equally by the way, and let me just say it helps a TON when playing to know both sides)
---
Why wouldn't they?
---
So if the last gen is powered and they break you out of stalk, you do the honorable thing and just walk the opposite direction right?
---
Cue the survivor mains bitching
---
I do, too. And Hawkins. The ironic part is, Ghostface is my favorite killer.
---
In any scenario this is still 1 less person on a gen being worthless and myers/gf will still find someone eventually anyway, not like he cant see the worked on gen. That and the game is balanced around no voice coms so it's not gonna happen
---
Impossible because I alway stalk ppl till 99% then when I'm on top of them I pop it.
---
Just no
---
Aight first things first use spine chill one of the easiest perks to get. Once you have that just get an understanding of it, when it clicks on and off, once you understand that if you see a spirit standing still and the the perk flicker, that means she's using the ability that's when you walk away from wherever you are. The park itself is good against anyone, not just spirit but is very handy against her. That's just point 1. Next Iron will, if you dont want to get that play Ace he is hella quite when injured, and if you dont want to do that look above.👍👍👍👍👍
---
I thought I was so damn clever as I started typing that, but then there you were
---
I know Both sides also. But spirit is just so strong. I don’t know how to counter it. And when I’m killer I don’t find myself getting mad at any survivor perks. All of the survivor perks seem okay to me but I’m only a rank 12 killer so I don’t see it all the way so forgive my ignorance. My survivor is rank 8 so j have a decent idea on how most of the game works but I honestly have no clue how to counter spirit
---
I can get behind this. If you’re gonna nerf insta heal then nerf mori too. I’ll agree with that idea
---
Almost bought the Clown just now for this perk: checked DbD twitter to see what the shrine is and it had Dying Light instead of Pop, dissapointingly went on DbD to buy clown and saw Pop there instead. Of course they messed up their own post lol
---
Yup. Because it's good.
---
I’m planning on maxing out jake next, and my Ace has no perks and I’m not interested in his perks but I’ll try jake
---
That sexy sigh Ghostface does? Mmm something’s not right. But Doctor is spot on!
---
All the competition DBD could have had was its own worst enemy.  DBD never actually had to step up and improve  to show it's  the better game, everything else was just a sloppily put together mess with its own myriad of issues.
---
F13, Soul At Stake, Last Year, Hide or Die, Gold Express, all these games were basically shot in the foot by their own devs and become just huge clown fiestas. 
---
You want to know the only game that could be a contender? Identity V, and it's because BHVR actually helped them with that game and they only just now released an easier way to play it on PC. It still feels a little janky to play but out of all these assymetrical horror games, it's probably the best.
---
I don't know what it is about this genre but developers really shit the bed and pump out subpar products. It's why I was hoping Capcom could do at least something half-way decent with their version.
---
The moment BHVR actually has to break a sweat at someone stealing their customers, is the moment they'll buckle down and try to improve the game.
---
$10 and 70 days to get to 70.
---
If you buy the tiers its $1 per tier after buying access for $10.
---
I'll go after Adrenaline after I get Iron Will to close out my stealth build
---
I legit just had that.
---
A lot of countering her is the mindgame.
---
Throwing pallets early, walking when she’s phasing, using iron will, basically anything to help break line of sight and make it hard for her to track you. Watch true talent on YT or Twitch cause he talks about spirit a ton
---
As killer I get these random orange bubbles around the map that's not a gen exploding, what causes this? Thanks! Sorry, I'm new :)
---
No problem. I really like it, but yeah a quick and easy perk change can be done. Just keep the name :)
---
Iron Will is fucking amazing. Especially at tier 3.
---
It says "Sell your soul to the devil. Join us N-word" (not literally N-word, I'm just not going to type that)
---
So yeah, yikes. :/
---
TRAPPA!!!!!!!
---
Spine chill or premonition
---
why are your servers so shit bhvr? why are you unable to produce a decent netcode to make your servers work bhvr? why are do incompetent motherfuckers find it acceptable to go on group vacations when your game is still running like dogshit on each and every platform? how do you find the audacity to charge people 50 dollars for the shittest version of the game on switch?
---
So if you stalk them to 99% and they break your stealth before you can hit them, you wait the full reset time and finish the stalk before you attack right?
---
Even if you suck with the saw, you can still get across most maps faster than any other killer.
---
I had this on my Spotify playlist and I don't regret it a bit
---
Mind games and playing more stealthy from the beginning to end
---
People scream she is broken, but that’s not true at all
---
If she was, nobody would ever escape or do remotely well against her.  She is just top tier killer who punished the way survivors have been playing for most of their dbd lives...  you don’t loop her like normal, you don’t play bold against her, just play immersed.  Not every killer is the same, we must adapt. For example, I’ve always hated doctor and do worse against them because it punishes my play style, but I’ve learned to live with it and change my game up. 
---
I’ve survived against many spirits and I’ve also died to them.  We as a community have to stop immediately crying for everything we don’t like to get nerfed or changed.  Learn the character, get better at facing them, and move on.  
---
Try playing some games as spirit.  It may help you understand her more.  Thats what I do with killers I have a hard time going against, I play them a lot to understand the mindset and such. 
---
Good luck
---
What do you mean "sorry if this is a repost" when you know that you did it? It was in the sub like yesterday lmao get out of here
---
How?
---
Get killer to red ranks before making final judgments...  it becomes so much more rough on average lol
---
Lol. I mean it happens like once every ten or so games to me and many other killers. Watch any killer stream and it happens at least twice when they down some guy and get DS'D by someone they don't even remember hooking.
---
Yessss, after Iron Will, I can wrap up Meg and do Feng for Lithe so I can have all the perks I need to be a successful stealthy Kate main
---
I just rip it up. And eat it. I don't care about rules.
---
Yeah, no. In the past the updates they have delayed have been full of bugs anyways. And even if they do catch all the bugs (which they won't) I don't buy that they suddenly figured out there were things to fix the day before when they've had months to work on this. I figure they knew it for some time and yesterday someone went ''oh yeah we have to tell them the update isn't coming tomorrow.''
---
Standard m1 killers like Wraith, Trapper, Legion or Clown are nice to learn the basics.
---
Ayyy, good to see another one repping the flagship beauty of the game :D
---
On the same tier? Its like Devotion if it capped at 70 you just play and it goes up. You don't have tiers in tiers just 70 levels to grind out.
---
Holy crap! This is amazing! Great Work!
---
Better performance? They haven't done it yet so don't get hopes up
---
Remember she was like 14 years old before taken by the entity, when she entered the entity’s realm she was put in a 30 year old body.
---
Ya welcome
---
Wow killer perks have been on a roll lately. Discordance, Spirit Fury, and Pop all in a row.
---
Oh, yea that’s a yikes from me.
---
Back then, he cheated regardless, so they hated him. Now it’s not such a big deal. I’m a fan of him, tbh.
---
End game chat: "You toxic trash baby killer 👺👺👺"
---
Oh, yes
---
Dude I looked at some and that’s just wrong
---
I agree, but I don't think Behaviour gives a shit about overpowered  survivor perks unless killer mains start dropping their game
---
So its 100 tiers but you can only get to 70?
---
[removed]
---
Bruh ima be honest with you.... if you find it impossible to beat a spirit, them YOUR the one fucking up... let me teach you a little lesson in trickery-
---
If you are at a pallet or window the spirit CANNOT play around it... if her power isnt up shes the weakest killer to ever exist and you basically are uncatchable, if its up then it's a mindgame of if shes phasing, or not... it's her place to guess what your going to do afterwards... slow vault the pallet, fast vault last second, just leave the loop, fake leaving the loop to bait an over commit.
---
Shes perfectly balanced if you have the understanding and brain cells to take advantage of her lack of information at loops and force to guess.
---
Dont be nerfing killers just because their capable of catching survivors, since almost every killer is not able to do this and it's the biggest reason every pro player, and every patch note demands survivor nerfs. 
---
Not killer nerfs.
---
At least they got one perk right
---
Anything is scarier than legion tbh
---
Embrace the dark side
---
This is true. Killers never really get shit that benefits us
---
I’m afraid of the dark
---
Killer perks have been on a roll. Discordance, Spirit Fury, and Pop all in a row.
---
Phenomenal!
---
Cant wait to steal it in a few weeks
---
No its only 70. Do the 70 and its done until the next one releases in the next mid chapter patch.

Happend to me 2 times today as a killer look extra weird coz surv tp behind me after pallet breaks. And i play like 4 games only. One time it was actually this exact pallet and from same side but second time it was some random pallet on game.
---
It's ok Daddy Clown will illuminate your life
---
I’m sure the flashlight clicker reported you also.
---
No
---
Oh makes more sense to me. So basically in other words you dont get your ten bucks worth back like people said you did
---
I have my opinion and you have yours :) we are having a blast with Identity V
---
Show some love for Susie? I mean okay but what does that have to do with the rest of the post?
---
Bruh nurse is still the best killer in the game by far... TRU himself the dumb ass who started this whine bit his own pride cause he was dead ass wrong when he played nurse realizing HE WAS WRONG and 3 seconds minus the 2 for fatigue is NOTHING.
---
That’s who I use though... lol
---
And I stay stealthy as hell
---
thank you
---
No idea.. But you can download it on their site

Please don't abuse your power.

I have broken a headset cuz I died on 1st hook with a swf

I notice a trend where people, such as you, with terrible opinions for this particular game tend to be far left types. It's a weird thing I've noticed but not too unexpected when you really think about it because ultimately you're using mental gymnastics to believe whatever nonsense you believe. 
---
But I'll break down your bullshit bit by bit.

&gt; The fact that you don't think killers are the same is part of the problem.
---
The definition of a "toxic killer" according to survivors are killers that don't play by the rules. Sorry breh, a guy camping to make sure a guy dies in the 3rd phase, or camp till they get to 2nd phase, or camp because the guy acted like an ass, or (the majority of the time) camping because the team is mindlessly hook rushing or hovering around that hook trying to bait the killer isn't being "toxic" . 
---
Let's get this out of the way: the killer isn't being "toxic" when they don't play by survivor rules. Okay? Do you understand that? Let's get that out of the way. 
---
&gt;Survivors complaining about spirit being in every game in high ranks is a problem but apparently it's completely fine to complain about how many use DS.
---
It's a problem that people are using a strong killer? The way I see it it's like fighting games and people who are proficient will use top tier characters because they want to win. Do you know what other people do? They learn the matchup and learn how to beat that character. In other words: stop crying and git gud. 
---
&gt;I play both, i see this bullshit everywhere
---
No one. Absolutely no one with a brain believes you. Because the assholes, like you, throw up this little shield "I play both sides." But have one-sided opinions. I would bet the farm that you believe that killers are OP and need nerfs. Kiss my ass. Seriously. Kiss. My. Ass. 
---
How about killers not being FORCED to use perks to slow the game down?
---
How about there being more than 3-4 killers that stand a chance against red rank and especially a SWF with mics?
---
How about ALL killers standing a chance?
---
How about horrendous loop spots and pallet lands being flat out removed? I'm not talking about the shack or double t-walls. I'm talking about garbage like the loop in the warehouse in Ironworks Of Misery. There is no reason for that loop to exist and it could be fixed in a heartbeat. Survivors have plenty of areas to run to in that building. That window has no right to exist. Not to mention the pallet lands in Blood Lodge or the Thompson House or Gas Heaven. That shit should have been addressed years ago and yet we still wait. 
---
So cut the bullshit. Just admit that you main survivor and want to remain in the power role and you hate anything that threatens survivors no longer having that power role.
---
Just to clarify, the comment above it makes a random survivor the obsession at the start of the game. Hitting a survivor won't make them the obsession.
---
Just to clear up for any newer players.
---
OMEGALUL
---
There was also infectious fright 2 weeks before discordance
---
Bruh just learn, watch vids, dont bitch about a killer just cause you dont know how to beat it. 
---
Survivors are by all literal raw math the dominant force in the game. If anyone needs a nerf I think survivor potential is a good place to start.
---
Because everything's hard for everyone and it's a video gamw
---
I didn’t have an issue with object with solo survivors, but with SWF’s it was obnoxious
---
You do you get auric cells in 20 of the 70 tiers that give 50 each. You get the 1000 cells back by the 70th tier.
---
I think OoO is balanced for solo play but only busted with Survivor Team Six SWF who have the OoO guy relaying your position to the other 3.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dlridd/every_bug_has_a_silver_lining/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Killers have numerous insta downs and powerful addons.
---
Any time a survivor gets something decent, you lot whine until it's nerfed.
---
Seriously, killer used to be hard in 2016. Now it's a breeze. If you're still complaining about playing killer, you're not good at the game.
---
I think it gets weaker when you kill other survivors, because you won't get more stacks from the dead
---
Bc you are.
---
It's hard
---
For everyone
---
Sorry the obsession kills your basement billy
---
lol
---
I usually run Feng min with 1 of 3 outfits I like.
---
The red dress Feng
---
The blue hair and mask, with the coffee shirt and shorts with black stockings 
---
The violet hair with the game over sweater and shorts with black stockings 
---
Not very stealthy, but it all depends how good you are at angles and timing.  I also like to run urban evasion lol (highly underrated perk)
---
The one time I had this opportunity, I was magically smacked down before i could open the hatch
---
&lt;3
---
He's such a cutie! I really like his videos and his accent is adorable. He's probably my favorite streamer right now.
---
I'm a spirit main and I agree with you.  But there are ways to counter her.
---
1. If you're in comms you can have your friends let you know if she has started phasing.  Really if you're survive with friends vs spirit this should be habit.  something like "in phasing".  This stops her from pretending to phase and allows you to get some really sneaky escapes.
---
2. Spirit is a bit like nurse where a lot of times the best action to take is to change direction when she fazes.  I generally run back the way I came, however, don't ever use the exact same path as her collision will get you killed. (Also this really only works if you have iron will)
---
3. If you're being chased and she phases and you're at a pallet, slam the pallet so that the pallet is in front of you and not behind you then walk away from the pallet.
---
4.  If the killer is phasing and you are running you want to run towards an intersection of some kind.  Her scratch marks or blood marks are delayed.  Meaning that she will need to guess which direction you went.  Do not give any clues as to which path you took.
---
Best of luck
---
I would say Self Care is more of a meme now. It might heal you when you need it but you're doing more harm to your team than you realize. At least no mither has clear bonuses whereas Self Care is a newb trap.
---
There's good camping and bad camping.
---
Last week I had a Huntress running the one hit hatchet + bonus hatchet add ons. One shot me at the start of the game, dragged me to basement and then camped me from 100% to dead.
---
(inb4 'your friends should have escaped because of that' as if literally being one shot at range easily gave them nearly enough time to do so xd)
---
 It if the last gen is done. And someone was then downed. You would know about the noed. So why wouldn’t you spend haunted grounds cool down looking for it? Thank you fo listening to my meme dissect segment.
---
You okay, buddy?
---
Ive been getting SO many survivors t bagging me at the gate...and then, just dying. I stab them and take them away. hahaha
---
so many fresh fish in the water, i guess
---
Just play them all and see what clicks. People say Billy, Nurse, Spirit are top tier. However I find the most fun/success with Pig, Legion, and Demogorgon
---
If OoO is such a big deal to you, there are counters to it, anything that adds the blindness effect to survivor will do, if addons don't last long enough for you run third seal and if you want to protect it run thrill of the hunt
---
Is there no counterplay to that? Played a game yesterday where someone started recovering someone who got downed at the door like this and I couldn’t pick them up and had to smack the guy recovering and during my swing recovery they both left
---
No but you can just go ahead and start up a kill your friends with one other person. My suggestion is their is a guy on YouTube who does a series called entity education and teaches people how to play killer, I watch him every time I buy a new killer because I love how well he can teach these. I also suggest watching rank 1 people play the game and analyze how they play the game. My suggestion though is level up nurse for her nurses calling but don’t play her because she sucks.
---
And you’re being downvoted... for some reason. I love Otz, he’s my favourite DBD content creator, but this is your opinion and it ain’t like you’re being aggressive about it or anything.
---
I run Spine Chill so I still know when you Wraith boys are hanging around :p
---
Iri head is dumb but I dont see how to nerf it anymore, clowns pinky finger is easily countered, spirits anal beads are broken and need nerfed. 
---
Meanwhile survivors have a addons that can reset a entire chase in 1 button (I know they are changing it), A item that let's them leave the game and cant be countered and perks that let them get off the killer's shoulder for a full minute after hook because "tunneling"
---
Be careful when breaking line of sight.  I wait for line of sight to be broken to phase to avoid people mindgaming me during the phase.  If you break line of sight expect that she's phasing and you need to be trying to mindgame right then and there.
---
I’ll take it
---
Bonus???????
---
It can shine in coordinated teams and Fixated can be ran to speed up walking uninjured.
---
And a solo que environment, no I wouldn't want everyone to be running it and walking to hooks but at Tier 3 it can be a solid choice. You can either restrict yourself walking around the map and saving it for the killer or use it to get across fast and have it ready or almost ready when you next see the killer.
---
It is just more a gamble using it. That's said, you're not wrong in your assessment. I never run it. Lol. I just wanted to add some more nuance to it.
---
Thank you for having a productive comment

Halloween Kills [2020]- LEAKED IMAGES
---
A lot of info like this is from dev strea.s when they talk about lore. This is why its great they are adding the archives to explain them more lime they do in The streams
---
bloons td 6 is currently my favorite halloween event i've been playing
---
This genuinely scares me and I’m not sure why.
---
Okay. But this argument applies no better to huntress than to anyone else. You could argue Myers was born incapable of empathy and therefore exonerated from wrongdoing. You could say Bubba was only protecting his family as he was raised. All the killers have somewhat sympathetic backgrounds, that doesn’t make them any less evil.
---
The difference that makes “victimhood” here is that spirit kills out of and endless fury for her murder by the man she trusted most, whereas huntress murders “because fuck it it’s fun lmaoo”
---
I don't get it
---
How do you get to play with leatherface one time if you own him?
---
Yeah, I agree. Billy teaches you how they bee-line towards pallets/windows. 
---
Watch killer streamers like Tru3ta1et and Otz Darva to see how they handle loop spots and jungle gyms. I would say neither of them are good at Billy however. But in general they're good to watch to understand how looping works, how to hide the red glow, how to bait a pallet break and etc.
---
My team seems to die pretty fast too
---
Lmao I think I saw that one, was it yamaoka estate?
---
If you consider sprint, solidarity, dark devotion, or pop good perks
---
Can we get a link off of Reddit? Won't load for me :(
---
Freddy sounds like he’s been kicked in the balls tbh
---
Yes it still has a fan base! And it’s quite fun where it stands atm. Killers are a bit underwhelming compared to survivors in Ranked mode but other than that it’s a fun game with its own competitive scene in China and EU (Haven’t heard of any US tournaments though)
---
1 shot huntress is not balanced no
---
Yes, you will
---
They were all normal looking in life...once....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I would say Jack Torrance stopped looking so normal when he destroyed his head using a croquet mallet and let the hotel take over completely
---
p.s. besides, yknow. Legion
---
I assume it’s easier to optimize the game with better hardware as with most PC’s, but i can’t say for certain cuz i really don’t know if it’s very much different to develop their game on consoles.
---
The only change for prayer beads I’ve liked is that  her phase sound should be able to be heard in terror radius base, and that prayer beads removes it in her terror radius
---
dedicated servers op plz nerf
---
Because of your ping situation, I'd go with balanced landing
---
&gt;spirits anal beads are broken and need nerfed.
---
No wonder she changes emotion every few seconds, broken and can't get them out.
---
I just bought him for barbecue and chili. I didn't even level him up in the blood web. I have no idea how an offering that lets you play as paid killers even appeared in my inventory. Especially one for the killer that it's in the inventory for.
---
Yeah, strange. I havnt even leveled up leatherface though. It just appeared there when I bought him.
---
hehe no worries (:
---
God what I wouldn’t give for a Silent Hill chapter
---
next shrine leaked /s
---
Yup, that's a valid matchmaking complaint.  Rough man.  Must be broken again because it was pretty solid for a bit there.  Maybe it'll fix itself with upcoming patch?
---
I’m rank 8 on survivor so I know the basics but I don’t know anything that’s crazy in depth, I so far can only loop really well on the dead cow tree on coldwind and I have a decent shack loop but that’s about it, I’m starting to get good on the ormand ski-lodge too
---
Mmmm salt
---
There are still nine other non-stealth killers in the game. OoO will continue to be a big problem.
---
1. She has jagged glass sticking out of her body
---
2.her limbs are chopped up
---
3. The expression on her face
---
I live near that region and we did so dont be a moron and make false claims
---
I’ll be trying to remix a song while playing bing bong man
---
I'm decent with spirit but I went against a SWF who immensely clapped my cheeks with their looping, gen rushing, coordination and trolling. Completely made me feel inferior as a killer.
---
how old are u
---
So the safest pallets in the game. Doesn’t show much skill involved as there is no mind game to those loops. Plus if you try loop a good spirit on basic runs of loops then it’s to predictable
---
DBD never had a Halloween event before in the past? This will be my first Halloween with the game. I started playing in the beginning of September. Still fresh with the game. 😋 loving it, too. 🤙
---
Run prayer beads and then hit them once and then you get your second hit for free
---
Tough to prove that wasn't a glitch. This game is far from bug free. I reported a guy who was unhookable with permanent dead hard speed, with video. They didn't ban him. They said it was a glitch in the game.
---
18 F
---
God I always think of the untapped licensing potential from video game horror franchises, since all we got so far in that department is Bill. SH2 is one of the better choices I think for potential video game chapters in dbd, I feel like Red Pyramid and James would be a really cool pair, though personally I think Lakeview Hotel would be a better map choice, splice in the otherworld and the outside area in there and you have a nice trippy disjointed map.
---
I bet they don't give us a damn thing, and assuming it doesn't start that day the event still ends on the original end date, no extra time
---
Well if spirit isn’t strong then are there any killers in the game that are strong becuase people make it seem like very killer is utter garbage and doesn’t need to be changed
---
Legion is GARBAGE dude
---
Thank you for making this
---
Yeah, with how smug and knowledgeable they were about running through vaultables, its hard to say it was just a glitch or only 1 guy. The Laurie was the only one that seemed legitimately confused.
---
you've saved yourself a ton of trouble
---
He should just be there when you log in, buying it works as a key you don't need to download it since that's done in a patch
---
Just reload the game.
---
This is why I use Bamboozle and Butcher. If you’re not going to heal, I’ll make looping just a bit harder for you. If y’all decide to heal, I’ll make it take forever then, just to hurt you easily again.
---
close game and restart it. if that does not work make sure it is bought and if so restore licenses then open game
---
I have multiple times already.
---
I think spirit is strong, same with a few other killers.  But I don’t think they need nerfs as even when playing against them many of the times survivors still win.
---
I completely hate survivors like that. They just make you feel worse about yourself and makes me want to stop playing. If you're good at the game, show it in good sport.
---
Could never live up to the hype.  They know this.
---
Making Half Life 3 would basically be signing a warrant for themselves.
---
Alright, I'll try restoring my licenses
---
OoO is often a boon to non-stealth killers, as it tends to give more information to the killer at the start. Just kill the obsession, and be done with it.
---
And also what survivor perks are game breakingly overpowered Becuase lots of killer mains complain about those but never once have I complained about a survivor perk being overpowered
---
Holy fuck that is bad

I talked about insta downs, iri head, pinky finger. Unless your talking about noed and myc and shit like that. In which case those perks all have pretty reqs to get the insta down, insta heals have no requirement to use them.
---
I respect the post game chat from these players! Good to see some good people in the DBD community!
---
Why can't a real game company just buy out the game and fix all the bullshit?
---
I don't disagree that it's fishy. But you need demonstrable consistent blatant behavior to get someone banned.
---
This thread is kinda old but here's a faster solution where you don't have to restart the application found by me
---
When the NAT Type error occurs and you can't press anything nor cancel the queing then just go to customization&gt;store&gt;back out(circle) and ready up again. 
---
If everyone does this then you can just continue looking for a lobby and don't have to restart the game

You need to progress through the free Rift to get the vials for the sets. Nurse's set is only available in the paid Rift. The only thing the offerings give you are bonus bloodpoints during the event; essentially the event and the cosmetics aren't tied together.

I’ve experienced the same issue. Playing the game normally and **bam** “You have been disconnected from the host” whether I’m killer or survivor. Add-ons/Items/Offerings gone and 0 BP earned for the match. Had a full killer game and as I went to hook the last person... **dc**
---
I don’t think any perks are game breakingly overpowered, but there are certain perks which are strongest out there
---
So that’s why his face is so wrinkly and gross. It was all just an elaborate eyelid!
---
Some of them are pretty good. Pig’s ultra rare is good, Myers is pretty good(if i remember right), and Wraith’s ultra rares are very strong.
---
Thats fucking funny, I know it should be fixed but that also sounds it would be an amazing option if you could also do it on purpose
---
Fair enough.
---
I might just be a cynical asshole so I might not get there are massive appeal but he has a really good personality and I could at least admit he's really attractive.
---
However I barely know him so my pants will remain on
---
Hey man what’s your problem with Legion? Freddy wears a hat and he’s a killer
---
I had a meg boop my snoot this very night!  It was precious.  It never fails to make me laugh when survivors get all up in my grill.
---
Sorry I meant ultra rare add ons for survivors
---
I’m planning on dropping self care for iron will Because usually a teammate can heal me and self care doesn’t come into play every game but I don’t have many other good perks to swap it with at the momment aside from spine chill
---
Yeah that’s fair but when you think about it that makes noed not a crutch perk because it counters adren
---
People think they no everything but we know nothing
---
Take em off it’ll be worth it
---
LMAO
---
He does break down a door.  Maybe some special axe move called heres Johnny, where he winds up a swing, and if he swings while a pallet drops he is unaffected by the stun and breaks the pallet.  Idk how to balance it without making it super strong, but thats my first idea
---
Nah those are still very strong. Brand New Part, Syringe(even post-nerf it’s gonna be decent, not horrible), and Odd Bulb are pretty strong.
---
I'm on PS4 and get messages pretty often and it's possible to get them that often
---
Lmao. Each time a gen gets done, whoever’s dicking around in the basement randomly gets locked down there for 15 seconds, but the survivor with the perk does actions 15% faster
---
And surveilance the week before discordance too
---
You can stack 2 addons plus you ain't hindering yourself, like what you can't win without addons?
---
That’s completely false but ok
---
Kek
---
Bruv why was it 18+?
---
Time to look him up
---
Not trying to be picky here, but the correct play by Feng would be to heal you. No body blocking needed. Billy would need to hit her, and while he's in hit recovery you crawl out.
---
You can't pick up someone who's being healed. And if he chainsawed her, you both crawl out while he's in hit recovery.
---
Went from a guaranteed escape to an extremely lucky one.
---
PC or Console?
---
Not because they were Nazis, but because they were warm blooded
---
I wreck with Demogorgon. I use Bamboozled with him, only Killer I use it in, Pop and BBQ. The fourth slot is open but often taken by NOED. With his insane map pressure it can be really hard for survivors, even SWFs. And when all gens are done NOED does it's Job and the portals by telling me if someone is close to the doors
---
Console PS4

Idk why you are getting downvoted for a joke lol

If you say anything negative about this guy or ask a general question or state a opinion, they downvote you.
---
After like 10 minutes just got error code 8018
---
No clue. I didn’t mark it as such, but Imgur put that tag on it anyway.
---
🤣
---
My internet is fine the only thing not working is DBD
---
Otz I want you to dead hard into my tree
---
Brand new part is trash. It isn’t worth an ultra rare and it’s the best of all three. Odd bulb reduces the usage of the flashlight by so much it isn’t worth it to run it instead of counter batteries. And the post nerf syringe completely guts it. There’s a reason so many people are complaining about it, it’s extremely situational. 
---
These range from giving you a slight edge in time to complete gen (which if you’re high ranked like me you hit most every great so it’s extremely negligible) to simply being worthless with better things to run. 
---
Meanwhile killer can legit remove an entire player 30 seconds in, there’s a reason the game is 4v1. Removing a player to make it a 3v1 as soon as one gets unhooked and tunneled makes the game extremely unbalanced. At that point it’s who can survive long enough to get hatch
---
Anytime I poop the snoot I get hook camped...
---
I completely agree with you :) my advice for those who do use it though is to try the other exhaustion perks and get good with those. You'll see very quickly why they are better and will wonder why you ever bothered with sprint burst. Thats how i went when noob me changed from sprint burst to lithe then to dead hard. Now i cant help but run dead hard, its just so much more superior.
---
I guess uninstall and reinstall, unfortunately on console you can’t verify files to do with the game, and this is a common glitch on PC where you need to verify the files thru steam. After some basic research it seems like you can’t do this on PS4, so the only thing I’ve got is uninstall/reinstall, or restart the PS4
---
130-250 usually but because I'm high rank and I wait forever I don't dodge lobbies up to 350.
---
Balanced can be situational (rng) but it's good. The game is one of the best maps for it, hospital might only have one spot you can use it but it's a very strong loop. If you get bad rng you may play in maps with no hills but it's not common enough to make the perk not worth using. Lithe is good but BL is better, even when exhausted you benefit.
---
Boss you killed a child

---
Can I ask why everyone wants to have crossover characters? I personally would much rather have BHVR make new killers instead. I love the design direction for pretty much all of their unique killers. They get better with every one they make. Can someone enlighten me as to why everyone would rather have licensed killers?
---
Well they can't say "Hey everyone, due to our constant and utter failure as a game dev, we fucked up something SUPER simple (again) and need to wait a week or two to fix it. Of course, something else will probably also go wrong, and since we're really, REALLY cheap our 1-3 people fixing these problems are REALLY bad at their job, so expect everything to be broken regardless! But don't worry, more $10+ outfits are coming soon!"

Go play granny and granny chapter 2 and get back to me
---
Im not a killer main, i would say im a survivor main but i can name a few toxic perks, Object Of Obsession, Dead Hard ( i run this one ) Decisive Strike [i guess] i honestly hate Urban i dont run this perk but when i get survivors being immersed as hell with Urban i get so annoyed LOL
---
Stupid Killer trying to kill the Survivors smh you're supposed to let them all escape it's in the name 😤
---
That is because we do not poop snoots. We boop them
---
when did I say or imply that?
---
I don’t think Dstrike is that OP anymore but I’m a survivor player so I wouldn’t know and I feel like deadhard is a really easy to bait out perk
---
OoO, that is all
---
Lol I cant stand playing without urban
---
When the NAT Type error occurs or you have an unlimited lobby search going on and you can't press anything nor cancel the queing then just go to customization&gt;store&gt;back out(circle) and ready up again. 
---
It was honestly already kind of absurd that a horror game was waiting 'til the ass end of horror month to launch its event to begin with instead of milking the alignment in theme for all it's worth.
---
I used to think that perk was horrible until I realized hay the odds of the killer looking directly at you at the exact moment is incredibly low,I can see why that would be overpowered
---
That's just how reddit is. I've been a user for over 5 years and used to be a mod on multiple subs. I've come to accept that people do not use the vote system properly and instead treat it as a disagree button. Saying you dislike or criticize any large content creator always upsets people even if your reason is justified or logical. That is just how people are.
---
I won't hold it against them even if I don't like it. I shared my opinion and others are free to disagree with it. I just wish they would go about it better even if I cannot force them too
---
Loosely implied: it's up to interpretation whether you were disagreeing the comment as a whole or just correcting a small mistake in it. I'm just reinforcing the point that, regardless, she's still on the "victim" roster.
---
I made this meme after an obvious 3 man all swarmed the hook and I just slugged them all around it with Save the Best for Last.
---
Camping a hooked survivor before the gens are done is not only frustrating for the survivor, but a bad strategy that yields less points for the killer and leaves the gens open for repairs.
---
When the exit is open, though, camping a hooked survivor sometimes is the best option. At that point in the match it's not like the survivor on the hook didn't get a chance to play.
---
And this is why I have r/entitledsurvivors
---
I know I am a day late, but is there any perk I should buy from the new Shrine?
---
Pop goes the weasel, Dark Devotion, Sprint Burst, and Solidarity.
---
I couldn’t find a survivor tier list with stranger things in it and I haven’t watched the show so I don’t think my judgment would be fair.
---
The killers aren’t in the game at all but the perks are as teachables for nonexistent killers, so you can only use them in KYF or if they’re in the shrine.
---
Bruh-havior

As ghostface it makes me want to cry :(

You underestimate the power of Black Metal.....
---
Balaced really shines because it is 2 perks in one. You get the speed boost which is very useful but you also negate the slowdown from falls allowing you to move at full speed straight away from the fall.

Lol so true, but if they at least came out and said .

“Hey we found a major bug, where every survivor has infinite DS, that they could use like the old version and also use it like the new version and the timer doesn’t stop” 
---
Then I would be like okay fix this and then release it, but how they are going about it just seems like a slap to the face and act like they are not responsible even though they hyped it up and put the dates out!
---
downvoted for the shitty medkit meme
---
It’s not that bad. Ghost main here. When we see each other we lock on and tbag together. Then I charge at them
---
Shit my phone changed that
---
Amazing. Mission complete.
---
now its the whole boring gargoyle thing .-. just not the same man, I miss old tf2
---
This. Literally everything else has decent counter-play. At least its finally getting nerfed.
---
i was given that by my friend, i asked for a purple medkit and he gave me that. notice how i never used it during the whole game lmao
---
Nah he was talking about the flashlight bm that got her killed not her leaving
---
Gets hit multiple times by gun shots and sharp objects: I sleep
---
Has a wooden pallet dropped over: I SCREAM
---
What
---
Pop 100%, currently one of the best killer perks, Dark Devotion and Solidarity are pretty niche and Sprint Burst is probably the worst exhustion perk as well as being avaliable from a free character anyways
---
Hindered addons arnt the great either...
---
Yeah, Ive been handed one of those before. Made me wanna slap my friend.
---
The Sqadettes will decide your fate!
---
I haven't played in a few weeks, but I hate keys. Cowards way out, and an unearned victory.
---
Unforeseen circumstances.
---
Honestly I might have to agree with that. 2 survivors alive and they have 3 gens done they are able to key escape. Not to mention blood amber is a very powerful key add-on
---
What icons you using?
---
Yup like dedicated servers and those are a mess
---
Remember this is a killer main thread... Honestly if u get DSed u were def tunneling lol i never worry about DS when i play killer tbh i dont think ive ever been DSed. Dead Hard is an advanced perk and once you know how to use it it can be very annoying for killers and the person who wrote this said he is mid rank so yea Dead Hard can be OP against mid ranked killers (some high ranked killers as well)
---
You forget the 4 killers with insta downs built into their kit?
---
You toucha mah devour, I toucha da you!
---
Dude just makes em quick, that doesn't mean spamming. People give him good feedback and he keeps going. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
---
As for someone that has spend too many hours on spirit, she is broken as hell. I played her too much even before people claimed her to be good etc. She received unneeded buffs and slowly became meta. What helps balance her is to change the way she can track sound. No sound tracking or it's not directional. that'll give survivors a chance to outplay spirit instead of running stridor all the time and being completely dominated.
---
Iron will is completely useless if a spirit runs stridor
---
Edit: grammar/spelling
---
The thing is legion is an original character they made him  they can't change jack that much
---
Idk it just feels like free pressure. For me if there are two survivors and one is injured I usually just go for the injured one because I can end a chase quicker.
---
Huh weird
---
I don't know, maybe I'm just not good enough or enough of an asshole to receive messages often but I rarely ever do. I have only been playing for like 6 weeks though.
---
Clearly you haven't played against spirits that have mastered her with a headset then.
---
Nurse is getting a change in PTB as they are working on her, i never implied that spirit is the only broken one. Hill billy is fine to me, he is one of the stronger killers but you are capable of outplaying a billy.
---
Sorry but, she needs a change asap. And that's coming from someone that enjoys playing spirit too much.
---
Not to forget: It's super rare for me to lose games as spirit, even on rank 1 games where survivors are completely focusing on generators because the chases end so quickly.
---
Edit: It's not even prayer beads you should be worrying about, it's this build:  [https://i.gyazo.com/d1489ed852d7d5c0ec4eb48cdfa15829.jpg](https://i.gyazo.com/d1489ed852d7d5c0ec4eb48cdfa15829.jpg) 
---
Reason: The charge speed into phasing and with the katana, coming out of phase retains some of the speed for a small second. that small second will make your lunge MASSIVE and fast. You'd have no time to react at any pallet or whatsoever. The more stacks on save the best for last, the faster the survivors go down. Honestly, this is something you should be afraid of. Not beads.
---
That's true tho, or at least from my experience
---
He laughs so hard that he goes into a fit of coughs. It’s as if Kenneth enjoys the survivors fighting back in the same way that Herman (Doctor) does
---
Your part of the problem
---
We should get a blood hunt until they release it
---
yes let me run 2 perks to help me counter this one killer. she needs to be nerfed in a few different ways
---
If plot armor isn't a thing then those 2 are dead, I would also drop Jane down to "Dies" as she's just a stressed out show host
---
That's what I thought until dedi servers hit. In BHVR's case, it's both.
---
Not really. If you don't cleanse then the plague becomes an M1 killer if you can loop and effectively run a killer then she becomes a pushover more or less.
---
The plague biggest strength is capitalizing off of survivor mess up since you don't cleanse you are always 1h away from being downed so those big mess up really play to her.
---
The big strategy for her is don't cleanse and loop her then when the last gen is popped everyone go cleanse in a corner and that basically beats her most times.
---
Her ultra rare add-ons tho aren't anything to scroff at 
---
One makes your aura visible to her every time you vomit forcing you to clean
---
The other let's her start with vile purge Which can really get the match moving.
---
You can play five or six games... or just one
---
That’s DBD in a nutshell.
---
in high ranks it s almost the only way to win
---
its r/deadbydaylight this place is 90% hate
---
That'd be a pretty fucking weird thing for the Entity to do...
---
Nice
---
And this is why I run Unbreakable and DS together. You can never go wrong with that combo
---
Hideously broken.
---
Tienes que dormir, homie. Thanks for your last stream; always learn a lot from seeing you play.
---
Like all they really gotta do is make it to where survivors can't see the auras of the boxes for her and Bam she's 10x scarier
---
Dude... I play spirit a ton as well. Also Myers, plague (most stealth killers)
---
And I also play in red rank survivors versus many different people.  Many spirits, many other killers as well.  But I can say 100%. She is NOT broken
---
Broken would make her unstoppable and rarely ever a chance...  she can be mindgamed and if you have competent people on your team (solo or swf) they can do gens separated where spirit won’t be able to get everyone.  
---
You win some, you lose some
---
Most of the time if I lose, it’s because prayer beads are more difficult, or because our team got too bold against her...  
---
So sorry, but as someone who plays a ton of killer and a ton of survivor both at red rank, I disagree
---
Steve would be at put up a fight
---
Love how innocent and out of place Bing Bong looks
---
Hey, I like legion!
---
and that
---
That’s how it works, but dunno if the color updates with movement or is set when the trap is triggered
---
Yep. It is easy to lose Legion with perk combos like Sprint Burst + Spine Chill + Lightweight to discourage Legions from chasing you. 
---
I play Legion decently often, but I am not even butthurt about it, the power is near useless. If you can fake windows, get lucky with circle chases and hitboxes, or have ANY exhaustion perk, and you have good teammates who do gens efficietly and can be okay runners, you will live 8/10 games. Just vaulting one infinite window will discourage Legion from chasing you too. 
---
And the power barely gives any extra movement speed, nor does it barely last. The 4-second stun allows survivors to do literally anything they want, reaching the next pallet or window, which just shows how bad a killer Legion is. Also, he/she cannot see any auras, scratch marks, or blood, so it's even easier to lose Legion. Deep Wound isn't even a problem unless you are a potato. I miss seeing blood as Legion :(
---
On top of that, the addons are the worst out of all the killers. Only ones that are good are the Stolen Green Notebook and the Yellow Etch Ruler, both just to make the power last 2 more seconds. Power punishes Legion if you miss or the survivors are too spread out, so you might as well play Bubba or Wraith, as those two have much ore viability. 
---
Because the power barely lasts too, you can just just loop a pallet until Legion stuns him or herself, then loop it more then drop the pallet on them. 
---
Remember, Legion is the weakest killer. I find him useful only for Blood points (if I don't get gen rushed in 5 minutes) and against potato survivors that crouch in the corners of the map. 
---
I really question anyone that thinks Legion is good or needs to be nerfed, as they can be countered by even the most basic green rank survivor. I ***personally***, find Legion to be most efficient to just M1. 
---
Devs overdid the nerf, as all they had to do was change deep wounds to be affected by terror radius then fix Frank's Mixtape and Cold Dirt. Everything else was fine.
---
Steve would die. He didn’t even really take down the Russian guy lol.
---
Oh how awful in a game that literally has Michael Myers in it and Laurie strode, I guess they're only going to release it on Halloween under contractual agreement, all the while apex legends event started 2 weeks ago and is running for 2 more.../s?
---
Implying what they specifically said. When they say they used to sing that song, they're implying to me that they specifically became those things later.
---
How can we become friends lol? Keep it up and have fun in the fog!
---
When I was white rank I didn’t know what a green rank was. Now I can’t go 3 games without getting one.
---
I’m at rank 12 rn but by the end of the month I’m usually rank 9
---
I get nothin but survivor daily and im a killer main
---
Right agree to disagree.
---
You have your point of view and I have mine. And in this case and my opinion: She needs a nerf.
---
Runescape isn't even getting a Halloween event this year. :(
---
Before they said sorry they probably teabagged the baby wraith
---
What.. what the hell was that ?
---
The event is happening?
---
Fast
---
What are the best perks for killers in general?
---
I love these concepts!
---
Everyone was pretty respectful throughout the match. The most toxic thing anyone did was sabo hooks for daily
---
*cries in pig*
---
What a stretch, I was correcting him because nowhere in the lore it's stated she is a kid.
---
*happy killer noises*
---
This is... not the right attitude.
---
Yep, in the forums I read it
---
Frank is a twink. Ain't anything jock about that boy.
---
honestly its a good combo but it's such a braindead crutch
---
That seems to be bulk of people’s issue with her.
---
She becomes mega speed tier 1 Myers without a visible body
---
Her base kit is fine and not broken/op at all
---
If they started punishing people for dcing, I’ll just find another way. My next go-to would be dropping all of the pallets until I get hooked and then killing myself
---
It’s more like 11.05% because the 4% chances aren’t additive.  Like if you flip a coin twice, you aren’t guaranteed one heads and one tails.
---
This. I recently got back into the game and am trying to learn demogorgon it dosent help that I get matched with green and purple ranks mixed with yellow ranks almost every time or a full swf
---
Either they cleanse and go up against a machine gun or it takes 15 years to do anything
---
I would just enjoy for her to move faster while crouched. So hard to keep map pressure while staying stealthed with how slow you move.
---
Besides the fact he used to play for a sports team and has his own varsity jacket.
---
You know you don't have to be a muscle tower to be a jock right..
---
Nurse is still higher than spirit.   Both s tier
---
Trapper was beating the crap out of the doc.
---
Meta/Strong perks = Pop Goes The Weasel, Ruin, Enduring, Discordance, Spirit's Fury, BBQ and Chili, Nurse's Calling, Save the Best for Last, and Sloppy Butcher.
---
(Enduring + Spirit's Fury) and (Save the Best for Last) are mainly for M1 killers to use so they dont have as hard of a time, the rest are pretty much useful on anybody. Someone else may go into more depth but those are the perks most killers use as they rank up
---
Hey they got dark devotion right give them some credit for that
---
If Steve has the bat, he'll put up a fight. If he's unarmed, just toss him into "Dies". What's one more beatdown for him?
---
As for Nancy, she'd probably have a brief advantage but that's about it; gun or no.

QNC allows for the mindgame jukes when they try to go around for the window but dont hear the noise so they double back.
---
Uhhhhh /s???
---
Kay, you've made your point. You've failed to change my mind as those people are not complaining about the real issue.
---
Paging:
---
u/Mystical__flame and u/icemoo
---
Where's your fake outrage in a political meme now? All I'm hearing from the preachers choir is crickets right now.
---
Ah, silly me. It doesn't align with your views so you'll say nothing when an actual political figure is in the picture vs some bat shit crazy child with no political affiliation.
---
I’m well aware. In fact, I have literally made that same point myself.
---
This literally must happened to me lol, exit gates get powered and I run to find them, find Michael camping it along with a teabagging Nea, I run past him only to get tombstones because she let him build up enough power to 99 it
---
When I finally get a Survivor oriented daily, it’s “escape with 1 new item” which is the hardest in the game in my opinion.
---
why does everyone wanna download this shit tier post so bad lol, not that i care though
---
Well, I’m not trying to change your mind...
---
I thought we just agreed to agree to disagree? 
---
This topic will always be up for debate with both sides. The best we can do is discuss it and end it with a smile and a nod
---
It’s a sign of affection it means she likes you
---
looks like ur vibes were off
---
In world of Warcraft in China they replace all bones and skeletons with bits of bread. I’m just imagining the Spirit’s hacked up limbs as baguettes now.
---
Helps optimize solo so much because only one person needs to go for the save. And if they’re found by the killer someone else knows immediately and can come in their place.
---
Maybe they were updating shrine and forgot which perks they announced and felt bad about unforeseen circumstances and just rolled again
---
Yup 😔
---
Literally just hide post game chat after a game like that. You made the right call. He got caught. Plain and simple. If he didn’t want to die he shouldn’t have gotten caught.
---
Bill should be with ash considering he’s killed lots of worse things than some dudes with knives..
---
Well yeah it makes sense
---
There is no point to discuss things with you if 1. None of the parties are willing to get their mind changed about said subject. 2. Agree to disagree. I'll leave it at that.
---
There is something seriously wrong with Tyler1...
---
ahah seeing this again reminded me how rough it was
---
Sounds like a fire truck siren
---
“Ah ding ding, ding ding”
---
Press LB if you’re on Xbox
---
rip, i hope ur next vibecheck goes better than this one
---
i guess that’s a good idea, i don’t really do many loops/mind games so maybe that’s why i don’t like the perk.
---
A little late on the news, thanks for trying though.
---
China has their shit together. Overwatch even has new skins
---
“No Network Connection”, anybody else? F*ck this bug
---
Conceptually these are all neat, but none of these hastes have any exhaustion tied to them, so they are all busted. Not to mention that any unavoidable and untelegraphed stuns to the killer are also broken. 
---
TLDR cool stuff way, too overpowered.
---
Make spirits footsteps louder and rework prayer beads?
---
PT 2 plz
---
Did the other downed person have unbreakable?
---
hold the run button and they cant heal you
---
If your running into spirit in collision your not a good survivor
---
Yeah I really hope she doesn’t get her basekit ruined
---
No excuse pray to the entity ten times this night
---
Yeah but I don't want to be constantly running. It happens anytime like I could stop to do a gen, boom I'm instahealed, stop to open a chest, boom instahealed, just annoying but I can't fault anyone for it, how are they supposed to know
---
Prayer beads are a problem too, but if she got the other changes she needs then prayer beads wouldn’t be broken like it is rn lol.
---
Yes but in chrismast
---
I've been having a hard time against ghostface.
---
Said here that to break his Stalking u need to look at him, but with 360 vision it's rather vague that i'm not sure if i need to have him on my Camera or directly at my face. Both dont seem to work for me.
---
Hope someone can enlighten me.
---
But it last until December.
---
This is very true
---
Me in a bush wanting a weindgo killer.
---
Expecting these developers to put out content in a timely matter?
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaa
---
Yes, if you have all your survivors at level 50, then they more than likely have the same perks. So it probably wouldn’t make much difference. Just have some spare blood points for putting them back up through levels.
---
Exactly. It's not as strong as an exhaustion perk and you have to be injured too. No one ever goes out of their way to get injured. Maybe when MoM works or if you're  securing WGLF stacks. 
---
Just let it be strong dammit!
---
Yooooo this is great!
---
I don’t really care for downvote just wanted to share my opinion
---
I agree, However I think everyone's definition of a victim may vary (maybe even subjective?)
---
Bubba was the product of at least two generations of inbreeding, it's pretty clear he's got a mental and physical conditions, and like you said he's being manipulated and abused into doing evil things, in my book he's a victim of our cruel world, being born with a disability and then grew along a vile and inhumane family, if he had grown with a completely different family I'm sure he wouldn't have grown to be Leatherface.   
---
Same for Billy, he wasn't a wanted child and he was extremely wrathful at his parents for locking him up and same as Ana, he doesn't know what right or wrong is and hes the first thing his animal instict tells him to do, maim and kill the anger away.  
---
 Are they innocent? Absolutely not. Victims? Maybe so, depends on your perspective of tragedy. 
---
  
---
As for Amanda I'm not fully aware of her lore so I can't say much about her.
---
I think it's worth it during bloodhunts when hitting the 1m cap is much faster. I originally P3'd Tapp because he had no outfits available due to be licensed but now he does. Ultimately it's up to you as the supposed increased chance at rarer bloodweb items doesn't seem to make much of a difference.
---
New Legion cosmetic looking nice.
---
I got on today super happy, to find out my game wasnt working and the event wasnt out. Rip
---
Holy fuck can someone with money give this man gold
---
I'm going to take a guess and say he's talking about save the world. Fortnitemares originally started on save the world.
---
Huh? I’m in China now and there are plenty of shows/games that involve supernatural things, including skeletons. DBD has a simplified Chinese version, and at least a small community here. It’s fine to criticize the Chinese government for doing shitty things, but you shouldn’t spread false information like that just because “lol China bad”.
---
If you don’t know that it’s spirit then yeah you can’t avoid detection in that scenario if you knew it’s spirit and heard the whooshing sound or heartbeat you should not be moving very much as that’s how people die to spirit. You can’t loop spirit so you need to immerse when shes nearby because if she injured you your kinda beyond help, also if your having trouble against spirit you should probably run perks like spine chill to help.
---
I’m mad I can’t get pop because my PlayStation account was suspended edit: this truly be a bruh moment
---
You don't give any examples of how to adapt and go against her tho... 
---
I'd say use iron will, quick and quiet, dance with me, and lightweight. Maybe that's gonna give you a chance to escape a chase idk. 
---
If they are good and you don't lose line of sight, or don't see them phase, or if you are at a pallet loop you are still kinda screwed.
---
They ran me for one gen, and I didn't mean they failed, I'm saying they got caught. That's just the cost of running a killer.
---
Samination is best animation
---
Whispers functions as an on/off switch for the question "Are survivors within 36 meters of me?"
---
While it's "**Active**" it will be lit, and occasionally you'll hear unconscionable eldritch grumbling. When it's **Inactive**, the perk will be dark and you won't hear those SFX.
---
Remember this and the fact that killers are faster than survivors. Imagine you're playing as a Killer with Whispers equipped and you walk in a straight line, and while doing so you see Whispers become **Active**. You now know that there is *at least* one survivor within a 180-degree radius in front of your path of movement, (and they are exactly on the edge of Whispers' radius at the instant it becomes toggled, which is 32 meters away from the Killer at tier 3).
---
Killers can use some tricks to narrow this wide radius down further, such as sidestepping after Whispers has just become active. If they step Left and Whispers remains active, then that 180-degree radius can be narrowed down to a 90-degree radius from their front around to their Left. If stepping Left causes Whispers to become **inactive** and go dark, then the survivor must be in a 90-degree radius from their front and to the Right. In cases where you happen upon multiple survivors, Whispers will remain **Active** as long as there is *at least* one survivor in its radius. (It's important to note here that most Killers have a Terror Radius of 32 meters, in which case means Whispers will toggle **at the same time** as the survivors begin hearing the Heartbeat audio cue, and this might cause them to start moving.)
---
Patroling the perimeter is one other way to reduce the possible locations around you that the survivor could possibly be. Again, if you're walking forward and Whispers becomes active, they *must* be in front of you. If there's a wall on your Right, then you know for a fact that there is absolutely a survivor somewhere to your front-left.
---
As a final note, the one hard-and-fast rule to Whispers is this: *If it's* ***inactive***, *there are* ***zero*** *survivors near you.* This can help save you time by reminding you to start searching again as soon as someone gets away.
---
Keep in mind that while I know all of this in theory, I still personally can't make Whispers useful in practice. That said, Whispers is very strong if you can ***git gud***, as it were.
---
Sorry if I didn’t mention but the thing people already know but don’t want them in their meta
---
I hate Spirit, don’t get me wrong. But I don’t want the beads changed. I have other frustrations with the killer that I think need to be addressed. I think everyone agrees on the beads is because they’re a strong addon she has thats an easy thing to point to for criticism.
---
Freddy: 😍
---
What do you mean?
---
Similar to what I said to derr you can’t loop spirit you need to hide in places she wouldn’t check as if your injured it’s game over so if a survivor circles a pallet they are bad as pallets don’t affect spirit as much as they affect the survivor,
---
China has banned movies like Ghostbusters *for having ghosts in it.* Not only that, Ubisoft tried to censor R6 Siege by removing art of a skull in one map. Maybe the ban isn't equally enforced but, unironically, lol China bad.
---
But that be how it is
---
Honestly I’m mostly fine with spirit, just nerf/remove prayer beads and give her a window animation, and maybe passive phasing
---
FYI it does not get wasted if they quit on the loading screen.
---
yes triggering/bm-ing the killer like in the video is wasting time.
---
but not if you just letting the killer get free hit. it benefit both the killer &amp; surv
---
I was upvote 69 (sorry I'm just trying to have a good mood around all this negativity)
---
A lot of my issue with Spirit is the fact that she maintains collision while in phase.
---
I try to mind game and slow walk backwards to trick her and then she bumps into me and gets a free hit.
---
It would also make gen grabbing harder if it was fixed.
---
...that can’t defend them against a plank of wood...
---
Stranger things was not delayed the summer event happened and dedicated server needed the work so what are you talking about.
---
They did it across the board. _Any_ art or design depicting a skull was changed. Operator icons, gadget names, even one operators literal face (paint.) It was met with such backlash because rather than make a separate client version for China specific users they decided to change the game worldwide.

---
We can already see the unprepared gens, we have iron maiden, and the killers power is useless in chase because who plans on letting a survivor get to a pallet and throw it down, not only is it luck based the killers power can be fabricated and bested  with brutal strength and you don't need to see the aura of an unhooked survivor just bring make your choice to get the exposed status effect on the unhooker ,this killer is a bad idea all around except for the Mori.You need to think of a killer that is viable in chase not a luck based killer that is completely useless, even more useless than legion.
---
Edit: Perk 3 is too strong. Also having a perma aura reveal is unfair and unbalanced
---
He needs to be in the center of your screen for you to reveal him. Like exactly in the center. Even then it barely works. Ghostface's reveal is stupid broken and the devs know this but they dont care. Cuz why give a shit about survivors when the killers are the ones creating lobbies.
---
It would fall off if it screams tho.
---
just 1 more day? says where? :-*
---
cuz he likes the survivors to get hope before they lose it? he controls the world, if he wanted the killers to just murder everyone they would move at 500% speed and walk through walls. wait that’s ku at nurse nvm
---
Yeah... If you use a proper gaming mouse you use a wire to charge it
---
Contact devs they will fix it
---
Death calls: seems stupid broke unless it has a short vision time or a long cool down. 
---
Old habits would be broken with brutal strength, unrelenting, and/or spirit fury. 
---
First perk seems okay, a little under powered in my opinion.
---
Second perk: I think killers can already do this.
---
Third perk: stupidly broke, killers need map information and this gives them all the information they would ever need. It would be taken on 100% of killers 100% of the time.
---
haha! Nice to see a toxic survivor get what they deserve!
---
One time, this spirit lost me and gave up but she happened to go through the same doorway while phasing that I was walking though.
---
I remember thinking “oh fuck”, because she downed me.
---
Jeff would probably go Varg Vikernes mode on the killer lol
---
Wow, I like this so much!
---
Honestly one of the best formats for memery around, and it came from god damn despicable me.
---
"Withered Turkey"
---
I found out about him like two weeks ago and i'm ready to die for him.
---
wish he uploaded more hag videos though
---
It's more of a lack of big streamers. WoW is still one of the top games on twitch despite the boycott and Hearthstone is usually up there too. OW does get near the top during events (OWL, Contenders, OWWC) but if there's nothing going on or there aren't a few bigger streamers on then it's down at the low 10ks
---
Balanced
---
I mean you’re not wrong how are you supposed to be running from a girl in bandages or school uniform
---
You didnt read it properly, it says survivor is hooked after last gen is powered, doesnt say downed.
---
In the remake. It was more ambiguous in the originals, although he definitely murdered kids.
---
Yeah, I’d make Beads a pink addon, which won’t do much, but thats the point. Killers should have a strong addon to go to at times. Just a few tweaks to her base and she’ll be fine
---
True but for probably one of the first times in dbd history survivors need to change their playstyle you can loop every killer but 2 and for those 2 you dont loop or play normally you change your strategies if you hear the heartbeat and know its a spirit you shouldnt be taking normal paths you should be immersing and waiting for her to pass by then continuing to do gens, and spine chill would completely remove this scenario.
---
Thank you. Its been happening alot as of late when I play the killer. At least 1 DC every other game.
---
Put Kate up to puts up a fight.  She’s a lot stronger than she looks.  For instance, after being brutally stabbed by a 6’ tall 300+ pound man, TWICE mind you, she still has the ability to fight back and nearly knock him off his feet all because she wrote a song like a year ago.  She is also described as a “Strike of Lightning” rather than a “Ray of Sunshine” by Benedict Baker.  She’s not going to give up hope, and she’ll fight back against all odds.
---
...there was no summer event. Seriously. It was cancelled. They decided to not do one. I mean this was only a couple of months ago so just simply check for yourself if you like but it 100% did not happen. Stranger Things was delayed only slightly.
---
However it’s really odd you acknowledged my point about dedicated servers being delayed with a kind of “oh well”. You asked the question about when are BHVR ever late with stuff, I answered. Dedicated servers were expected by the community. In fact BHVR’s exact words were “latest Summer 2019”.
---
I also don’t agree with all the hate on here btw, but blindly defending a company you pay money to for a product can be a bit naive. They ARE bad with communication and sticking to schedules and it could be improved. Doesn’t mean I hate them, or the game by pointing it out.
---
Pop for all those Freddy Mains!
---
I feel like that’s too out of the way of the horror/thriller kinda thing they were going for, but I feel like another AAA franchise would be cool
---
you dont have to be running, you can just hold down the button to run and still stand in place
---
Fat repost
---
i want this feeling of satisfaction
---
tell me how
---
He's the leader of the bunch
---
Garbage argument. Yes. Those 2 perks not only hard counter spirit, but they are good vs all killers in the game. Grow up and adapt or dont bitch. Plain and simple.
---
Its fucking annoying as shit to be tunneled. Tunneling is slightly toxic and you will get annoyed and angry survivors messaging you saying ur trash.  But if survivors really hate tunneling that much they can equip DS. I main survivor snd i hate tunneling but as killer i do it sometimes anyway cuz sometimes thats the only way to win against a toxic SWF
---
If survivors bump into you their not good survivors
---
Heyo Otzypoo! I’ve said otzypoo so much that it’s in my Autocorrect bar now!
---
Ahhh a man with culture &lt;3
---
Not really , there are many ways and perks to juke her but people refuse to try or use them
---
It's okay as a man of culture who runs a no mither shirtless David squad with his friends after a losing streak I know what you mean....it never loses
---
any locating perks and terror radius perks fuck this playstyle for survivors because you just have permanent noed anyway.
---
The thing would be such an interesting killer but would be absolutely useless against SWF. Imagine repairing a generator with a Nea, but let’s say when the thing “repairs” it actually regresses the gen. all of a sudden you realize the bar isn’t really moving then BAM it morphs into its form and slaps you.
---
Would scare the shit out of me.
---
But again, would be useless against SWF.
---
the game should be fun an more balanced in my opinion and also sub reddits are nothing but questions and bitching."grow up" lol
---
Teabag when gates are open and all 4 survivors still up? You just earned yourself a facecamp I'll tell you hwat
---
I had the same situation when playing with freinds we had 5 game against ghostface lol.
---
Not even worse billy just indoor billy. Billy is great in outdoors and open spaces. Bubba stomps at indoor maps and jungle gyms
---
She trapped the door.
---
SWF? 
---
Seen it a lot and haven't wanted to ask. But it's time I know. Lol
---
Just finished playing ghostface, got fucked up lmao
---
Groovy
---
ive had so many slow matches against spirits i cant even be bothered half the time man. especially at higher ranks where its just watching the spirit look for hiding survivors while youre siting on a hook or vice versa
---
Maybe you toxic survivors should just leave.  Ever cross your mind?
---
Most of the time its the spirit bumping into the survivors, not the other way around.
---
Tone down your ego a little bit.
---
You had to do my boy Herman dirty like that... But in all seriousness, I loved reading this, all the detail was amazing and I’m excited for what you come up with! Keep up the fantastic work!
---
Teaching a Rank 20 friend all the ins and outs of the game is probably more difficult than teaching an orangutan with no hands sign language.
---
Borderlands hasn’t started it yet :(
---
Lost the trapper mask but devs have acknowledged it's an issue. Still got the others for now
---
I ran off from the gate because the pig was chasing me.
---
It has nothing to do with playstyle, it's just Spirit can randomly trip over you and get the hit.
---
you can bully a bad spirit just as you can any other killer. at rank 15 its really easy to outsmart most shitty spirits but when you get to the purple ranks theres no fucking hope
---
Survive with friends
---
Yeah shes busted, i have 1405 hours lol, easy to deadass say straight when something needs nerfing, seen it all and spirit is no different,
---
it means survivor with friends. Party
---
Theres nothing wrong with questions and discussions but when I see constant complaints about nerfs to things that dont need nerfs, especially by people who aren't even high rank or are fairly new, it annoys the shit out of me. The game is quite balanced right now. Some things are a bit to strong like instant heals, and prayer beads but jesus man, literally every day there is 5+ posts about "omg nerf spirit." How about you just learn to play vs it.
---
Haha look sex number so funny
---
the issue is likely game breaking bugs. when i tested the ptb not only did demogorgon addons consistently spawn in other killers bloodwebs, but tinkerer was bugged so that when it activated the heartbeat permanently sounded like the killer was right next to you. I even said in a post a few weeks back that i would be surprised if they got it fixed in time. seems like the devs don't read our posts that much
---
Swf isn’t in the game anymore
---
It hurts...
---
Like u/Crysense basically said, no perk is toxic, but when you're going against a SWF (or anyone who wants to be toxic even if solo-queueing) you get some really ridiculous combinations, like they unhook 1\~ second after you hooked someone and "abuse" the fact that Borrowed Time works even if the Killer is not camping, throw DS/insta-heals, basically immediately undo everything the Killer does in the 3\~ minute match times at high ranks just to frustrate them.
---
I love this man so much you have no idea. Bad day? Otz. Good day? Otz. Whatever kind of day, Otz is there and he’s funny and talents and just fucking awesome. Also a cutie. Thank you Otz!
---
Yes it does
---
If I did this again, I'd change 'Mostly Annoyed' to 'Aggravated' and put Meyers there, and change 'Loves It' to 'Hilarious' and move Clown there
---
there are many problems with this, the main one being that the powers of the killer are more like perks.
---
the first one actually promotes tunneling, which is something devs try to dissuade.
---
Second one might synergize with brutal strenght, but then again would that be his power? breaking down pallets fast?
---
perk1: you already have the legion's one, altough it's less useful in finding, it is better at downing.
---
2.- Outsmart: already default skill of the killers.
---
3.-All ears: the name is already taken by ghostface, and there is already 2 very similar perks: legions: discordance and Pigs: surveillance.
---
Leave
---
You can still play with friends in public lobbies. Its just not called Survive With Friends anymore. They changed it so you have to invite friends into the normal survivor lobby.
---
I thought it's said that the accessory was put by the entity though . Either on a dev stream or on description
---
The Chapper: Trapter 1
---
Most underrated comment so far
---
Doctor’s new outfit confirms he’s not really amused.  The electrodes connected to his brain are raising the presence of neurochemicals thst make him happier.
---
Looks dope my guy
---
I’ve only ever used object during solo play.It’s hell when survivors are in a swf though.
---
No.  Myers is completely uneffected.  He’s inconvenienced, but not annoyed.  He has all the patience in the world, hence he walks to his prey.
---
Just ignore the noise man. I don't get very much time to play games. So I just try to enjoy it as much as possible. Win or lose
---
Dead by Delaylight
---
&gt;Ranking system is completely fine
---
I'm an average player, and I've risen to rank 9 in Killer. If I sandbag a couple of games, I do not lose ranks in any meaningful way. Maybe this is intentional. But I'm tired of playing against people in ranks 1-3. I shouldn't have to worry about playing outside of my ability, just like the very occasional rank 20-15 survivors shouldn't have to worry about me ruining their good time. If they're going to have ranks, the ranks should matter. If the ranks don't matter, let me queue up in an unranked system.
---
What you deserve
---
Don’t get found in the first place
---
Sprint burst sucks
---
Well how about surviviors are just lit up the entire fucking game. Lolololol.
---
That’s not how math works.  4/100 x 3 = 12/300 which is equal to 4/100.
---
WOW!! This awesome!! Please continue! I love how this amazing game has become from a cult game to popular nowadays! :D
---
Yeah I've noticed it as well, maybe they're tired of all the survivor DC's so now they just gonna DC when shit doesn't go they're way too
---
Bets on how stable it'll be
---
I wonder what the killer saw on his end.
---
gen speed is dummy fast in an optimal team. thing is this game isnt a competitive game. asymmetrical games can never be balanced. i dont dedicate much time to dbd every month so right now im rank 9 killer and survivor
---
play with thine food
---
That's an easy opinion to have when you're not a rank-20 survivor.  
---
I'm here to say hello.
---
They hated him because he told the truth
---
2 party streamers
---
You act like those came out on time? They’ve been talking about dedicated servers for over a year, and that’s something this game should’ve started with.
---
Uhh.... You mean Byers?
---
Oh no you have to turn your face to him. Your entire body has to face him and he has to be in the center of your screen
---
Alert, urban evasion, empathy, self-care
---
I either get got first or sole survivor.
---
Had a spirit hook me first in the game. Get unhooked, get hit, activate Borrowed Time. Run her for about 45 seconds, jump in a locker, activate DS. Run her for another minute or so. Rinse repeat until i die. All gens get powered (what do you expect) and she has NOED (what a surprise). Somehow this type of player is in red ranks.
---
Sir, do you have a license for that horny on main?
---
You must be new here
---
This was seriously so good! I loved the recasting of Doctor into a survivor. Oh and I was worried for a second in the middle that Trappy Boy was gonna actually choke the Doctor to death
---
Saboing hooks, IMO, isn't toxic necessarily. It would only get like that if all a team did was 99 every hook and then follow the killer around and ensure they never manage to hook anyone.
---
Yeah he posts to not otzdarva pretty regularly
---
You know him well
---
For me personally, Huntress, Ghostface, Pig, Myers, Nurse. Huntress because of the reads at loops. Ghostface, Pig, and Myers because... I don't know. Nurse because you can either outplay her, or you die in 5 minutes, which is better than a 20 minute slog against Freddy.
---
Sorry, I don't speak coward
---
Exactly

Yes, why wouldn't it?

Dark sense, Self care, Lightweight, We’re gonna live forever

Solid cosplay. Love the way you used a LED to make it look like a blink. happy early All hallow’s eve
---
Out of the loop here... what is the Rift and Archives?
---
I did buy Ash, I have Tapp but haven’t leveled him up at all
---
Why the fuck do you wanna buff a top tier killer?
---
In the book in pretty sure he gets pretty roughed up by the end of it. And he starts smashing his face in with a mallet. The croquet mallet could be a different weapon for him. And maybe if his appearance was bloodied up. Could be cool! But yeah otherwise he looks like a normal dude. 
---
Dick Halloran for survivor??
---
Ok, you can either hope for tenacity in shrine or get saw chapter
---
Volvo, ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ Give DIRETIDE
---
I’d get the chapter tbh
---
I can hear this image
---
Battle pass is the Rift. Archives are a set of challenges that will unlock lore.
---
I only get killer dailies and I decided to do one today and got a SWF group that destroyed me :(
---
Arrrrrr.
---
I have the chapter, just need to put some points in him. Why is tenacity a crucial part though? I’m curious now.
---
While it isn't called survive with friends anymore, it is still the exact same thing, just with a different, simpler ui
---
"But... how did you do that?!"  
---
"....it's a pallet, dum-dum, not a wall of fire."
---
I hate the face so much
---
You can crawl faster and recover at the same time. So you can be downed for a bit and get some wiggle time with flip flop. Otherwise you have to stop moving to recover
---
For example, Spine Chill is a great way to counter her.
---
Tysm!
---
Sure.  I wasn't trying to be cute or anything.  I literally could not remember the name because **Cruel Confinement** is so much catchier.
---
1 great perk, 2 mediocre, and 1 bad.
---
The great perk and one of the mediocre perks are DLC perks so you can get them if you’re F2P.
---
I think Solidarity needs a change or a buff, it’s too niche and even then I find the effect underwhelming.
---
I think he’s French
---
One trick I've figured out is once you get the Dailey close out the Dailey menu and then reopen it. So far that's helped me not go in with fake daileys
---
Not being combative. Why don't you like him? Usually I can't get into streamers, but Otz instantly clicked with me.
---
Tru3 is a much better player, otz is a much better streamer. I love both of them
---
It was his second ban. He mentioned it on stream once.
---
Hey man sent you a dm !
---
I've seen a lot of people use Borrowed Time to save someone of the hook immediately after they are hooked, so it's definitely a problem for Killers then.
---

I just don’t like face camping. How is that fun for anyone ?

I love when survivors don't cleanse. It's like playing with sonar.
---
Nope
---
bottom text
---
Right? I feel like most of the killer proposals on this sub have way too op perks
---
Like imagine it’s ability is to turn into one of the random survivors. You’re fixing a generator and it’s all good, there’s no heartbeat, a teammate comes out of nowhere and approaches you and you’re just like “hell yeah let’s get this gen” but like all of the sudden the character starts morphing and opening up (in a similar manner that the wraith uncloaks) and then it starts chasing you. I would have trust issues.
---
It's 2019 my friend so you mustn't concern yourself with such things. Everything is the same and nothing is different. Halloween is a social construct they'll construct another way.
---
Ah I see
---
Right, I am never regretting bringing the combo on Wraith. Especially when maps like Blood Lodge exist, now those pallets are the real braindead crutches.
---
“Sell your soul to the devil”
---
I literally typed this in the comment above yours and literally just saw yours. This would be dope as fuck
---
It really feels kinda like weebs are hype ones spending their money on that doe
---
That makes sense, it could be the opposite of training wheels.
---
Well, he already replied to a comment further up
---
No lol
---
For me it’s the last 2 panels swapped
---
I'm not saying the spirit is balanced. I'm just saying that a post like this is primed for people complaining.
---
Why wouldn’t they be able to use it again lol
---
Oh you may be inclined! You hear that guys? Put the team on overtime, scrap the plans. David wants his halloween event now, and he MAY BE INCLINED to buy cosmetics! 
---
What fools we were! Betting on proven revenue generation techniques, contractual obligations, and an honest appraisal of our capabilities! Row boys row! Break your backs and crack your oars men! /u/davidjzuniga1 may be inclined to make it all worth our while! Its soup tonight boys! All soup, and crackers for the children!
---
I actually hate that they made him so loud. It makes no sense for his character.
---
There wouldn't be fancy plants like last years. Only gens and hooks
---
Hmm, I wonder why people dislike the second strongest killer in the game that relies on 50/50 mindgames to win matches
---
We already play a broken buggy infested game. Just give it to us and fix it along the way like they always do. It's like how Mathieu Cote said on a stream right before a new chapter released (I believe it might have been the clown chapter) in which he said that the QA team told him, "you can't ship the new chapter because it has this bug or this bug" and Mathieu Cote just said, "meh we can just fix it in a patch update"
---
**Face obscured to protect identity**
---
Wtf am I seeing lol
---
The real question is why the fuck do you call him Ashley?
---
Well now that I think about it, they are all crucial. Beside boil over. You can swap that for no mither to always get up
---
have some goddamn faith ARTHUR
---
I don't think people are complaining that we're not getting the free event right away. It's more that this is like the 50th time this year something got delayed.
---
Yup that's an urban immersion self care gamer for you.  Crawls outskirts of map...My teamates all dead yet?  Hatch time!
---
Ok not gonna lie that was funny 😂 u got me there. Ill shut up now.
---
Eh, Bill should be with Ash
---
I play on PS4, anything higher than what I have now will throw me off, lol
---
Ty ty all in good fun
---
Take a look at his perks.
---
&gt;I can't speak for other players but my matchmaking has never been so broken...
---
Same for me. My matchmaking has always been fine.
---
No but if you only farm with one team mate and kill the others, yes. Just saw this happen today the Claudette the Hillbilly was farming with was body blocking survivors so he could get a chainsaw hit on them. The excuse as to why he didn’t farm with everyone is because “you didn’t join my party”
---
Small Game for insta broke hexes and just being the bane of every NOED gamers existence and Decisive to make the act of camping or tunneling me off of hook as fun as pulling teeth.
---
What is the current Shrine?

You can only use DS once per match
---
Top 10 Anime Crossovers
---
Alright cool thanks. Honestly just want my Huntress mask and David jacket. The other two I'm not too worried about
---
How was the term controversial?
---
Same here, over a week ago I lost mine and made a ticket and have just got the same "looking into it" message, haven't checked the Ornate mask, still have my Chuckles mask and Daddy Jake top, hoping they come back with the upcoming patch
---
You can actually pair this with tombstone. Imma say survivors shat themselves.
---
Oof
---
Thank you!!
---
Just wondering. How long have u been playing dead by daylight for?
---
In a sitcom you sure do.
---
Eh.. I stopped playing after they decided to make weapons 10 bucks a pop. Sucks cuz I used to be super close with the devs. :/
---
Dark devotion, solidarity, pop goes the weasel, sprint burst
---
Hope so. Hope you get your shite back
---
Honestly I could totally see all of these as real Chapters. Maybe not the Killers (those things are really hard to make) but the Survivors as well as the maps would be awesome. I'd honestly love a hotel / apartment complex or an abandoned science facility (that isn't Hawkins National Laboratory.) And while I think a "maze" map would be rather annoying to deal with and kinda invades Lery's territory the idea is cool.
---
Just eat the fucking ds and stop complaining
---
What a weird mindset. By default you should be getting 2k and having 2 escape. Not 4k.
---
You missed the point. Just like you said, they could leave. But they just have to stay at the gate exit line and try to make you feel bad for losing.
---
I see this a lot in the game, so I usually just walk towards them without really trying to hit or win. Just to make them go away. 
---
But then again, why is this necessary? Just go away.
---
Last I heard they’re being tested on and off on PC only.
---
I'd kill for Jack in this game.
---
He's right you know. Am too from both sides.
---
&gt;Difference of ranks should have a hard cap of 6. You might be able to send this to the devs cause something clearly went wrong here
---
I thought this as well but re-reading the change it says:
---
&gt;New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there’s no other new players queuing.
---
Kindred works for any killer tho.
---
What’s solidarity do?
---
it really doesnt. i can play legion and still mindgame just fine. it just takes practice. using spirit fury enduring disables you from learning cause you dont HAVE to
---
Not the long dark
---
&gt;I lost my David/Huntress cosmetic from the Lunar Event as well as my Kate/Hillbilly cosmetics from the Summer BBQ event. All purchased items and Legacy are intact, though.
---
Happened to me as well a few weeks ago. I sent a ticket and 36 hours later they gave it back.
---
Apparently it references poor living conditions in solitary confinement in prisons and psych hospitals or something?  I dunno, it had some incredibly tangental link to a phrase that is super uncommon but is just common enough for it to maybe offend someone somewhere.
---
It was dumb and so is the new name.
---
Not yet unfortunately. The lag switchers are still alive on console smh
---
Otz is what got me into this game. I loved his Dark Souls content and was really sad to see his channel stop uploading. Suddenly I find a channel called NotOrzdarva and there’s the golden boy playing some spook game.
---
All I’m saying is that if gens are popping I’ve got to get a pair of hands of the gens, and if you just so happen to always be injured I’m going to make the most of that
---
yeah i kinda thought that the update was now interwoven with the basic background of the game, so not modular at all...and it likely means all or nothing..
---
Because swf
---
15 years/never, since The Plague will always know where you are.
---
LOL
---
Did they confirm that?
---
Quentin tapped into the void.

Kirsty Cotton's gameplay should be shady, she will throw a bitch under the bus to get out. 
---
Perk - Hex: Bargain: A soul for a soul- you've made a bargain with the entity. Once/Twice/Three times per game, you can instaheal one health level at the expense of another team mate taking that injury for you. This perk persists until used or until the hex totem is cleansed.
---
Jesus this build seems like fucking hell lmao. If i ever get Plague I know what I'm doing

* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.

Well not sure how well the doctor would work for that

What I gathered from your explanation is you are just really bad at insults.
---
I cleanse to make them walk across the map when generators are too close together.
---
Well said
---
I should get it, yeah. Thanks
---
eat my ass
---
Real game?
---
That’s fine as long as it’s not the same guy every time, is my point.
---
Rise and shine BHVR, rise and shine. Not that I imply you've been sleeping on the job...
---
That would completely depend on the context. Nice assumption there. And in this case, I've got valid experience and my own evidence that she needs a nerf. Surely you can discuss your ways but it's a fact that she's just too strong. Surely the mindgame is all fun and game I can go along with that but aslong the sound tracking gets looked at. Stridor is just too meta/strong on Spirit (Or sound tracking in general). That's the only issue I have with her. Beads? Ehh sure it's annoying but eventually you can start predicting on where she fades to.
---
yup! public too, msged the guy afterwards and they had no idea how it happened
---
Letherface could also be confused, its just like a "ggreaaaurgh???"
---
Yep on ps4
---
How do I upvote this MORE than once????
---
How do you do it
---
Oh. So are we getting it back, or just...no, your mask is revoked?
---
That was the name, though.
---
I would definitely recommend you play around with everything until you find what you like best. I like to know a lot about where the survivors are at all times, but you may like more perks that help with slowdown or to end chases. A lot of perks come down to preference unless your running the basic spirit furry enduring build. One more thing, discordance is exceptionally good because it can be used for information and to help you slow down the game. (Btw idk if you’ll like pop goes on ghosty but just get it anyways because it’s amazing and you might like it on another killer)
---
No.
---
That’s what she is though, a mind game machine XD
---
On PS4, it's getting more and more frequent. I thought most of them were newbies but no, they're just toxic.
---
Probably definitely hacking but it could also be a glitch that they're aware of happening to them so they exploited it somehow and decided to be assholes.
---
Wraith when pallet stunned: *Demonic screeching*

...pretty much, yeah. Devs shouldn't announce anything they aren't willing to be held accountable for. But DbD is the ONLY slasher asym on the market. There's a monopoly, and when that happens, standards plummet to Earth's core.
---
resilience gang
---
Lol nice. 
---
And you must be the brain dead survivor main?  Of course you assume I’m a spirit main based on? I play about 5 survivor matches to every 1 killer match.  
---
And with those killer matches, I switch between half of the cast.  
---
So yes, I MUST be a brain dead spirit main, because I’m not completely brain dead at the game and can adapt to different playstyles...
---
Idk I think it’s fair against players at lower ranks (who actually have adrenaline) because it’s a complete counter to adren
---
White haired doctor girl delivers more good art.
---
I honestly love his pallet stun laugh. He sounds like he's going through a midlife crisis and is trying to find joy in his life. He laughs like "ha ha ohhh boy this fucking shit *again* I fucking love life ha ha!"
---
Lol “fact”
---
Ok.
---
i wonder what a 6v2 (6 survivors, 6 gens, 2 killers) would look like
---
The key phrase being "people like Otz." It takes an EXCEPTIONAL player to make anyone but Spirit work at that level, with even Billy and Freddy falling noticably short. So you can train for hundreds of hours and sweat every game, or you can play Spirit. All I'm saying is that I understand why we see her so much, and the fact that SOME other Killers CAN, theoretically, be playable at top ranks, doesn't do anything to change Spirit's much greater appeal.
---
Ima be honest... I wouldn't have if I was that Feng. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.

Feng min is bae

It's just my internet is horrible so I cant play killer without being accused of lag switching
---
The one true answer. I'd be forced to eat my words if Behavior actually released quality bug-free content. But my guess is that it'll be the normal dumpster fire that we're used to, even with the delay.
---
Instagram filters be like
---
The thing would be super cool as a killer too - give it the ability to shift into the shape of a survivor after an active observation period like Myers and Ghostface - survivors are warned when it has shifted but not who it changed into! Maybe can reveal the Thing by shining a flashlight on it, and to use attacks the killer has a short shifting period like Wraith’s deinvis. Mad mind games there and only the person who it shifted into knows they are the real one! Plus once you start to see it shift you’ll shit bricks!
---
Damn these tiers get crazy towards the end lol.
---
Sir this is a Wendy’s
---
&gt;Because its harder to loop when she has a ranged ability that can injure you
---
Plus it also multi hits which makes saves nearly impossible because she will hit both players with a single puke.
---
Because that's some gold shit tier post bro
---
gotta love how a lot of the lore gets blown out of proportion on this sub
---
hopefully
---
Had this happen tonight, actually. I was playing Basement Trapper with Iridescent Stone and Bloody Coil, and every single survivor died on their first hook in the basement. In that time, they finished all of 2 generators (I wasn't running ruin, thanatophobia or Pgtw) and nobody attempted to save their friend. 
---
Baffles me that a bunch of rank 7's were that afraid of going near the basement.
---
Plague died to natural causes, as opposed to Spirit who was flat out murdered. In a way that makes Spirit more tragic than Plague, but on the other than Aderis died trying to save people while Rin kinda just fell to an unjust society.
---
Look I'm not casting votes for either of them. Their lives both sucked and to be stuck in the Entity's realm is a pretty shitty end to a pretty shitty story.
---
it seems our lives as killers and survivors are slowly becoming the same thank you BHVR
---
Jesus, that Bill popped out of nowhere. Actual blendette.
---
It's BHVR, what were you guys seriously expecting? Competence? Logic? Lmao
---
He's Spanish, he's mentioned it before
---
Just commented this on another thread - this would be the coolest killer in the game for sure and would actually be scary since you can’t even trust your fellow survivors! Power would be much like I originally imagined the Legion to have
---
The "Waiting 40 minutes just to get shit on Gang"
---
Well, you're both right and wrong. On the one hand, DbD must be THE horror game because there are no others. At least not if you want asym, not a F2P, and over 500 players online.
---
On the other, Dead by Daylight isn't a horror game. I've seen slashers; nobody ever teabagged Michael Myers in the films. Not even the Rob Zombie ones, and I wouldn't put it past him.
---
remember that enough of his body needs to be exposed and that you need to be in range and some addons will lower that range where he can be broken out of night shroud.
---
Multiple threads now - this should now be a priority for BHVR
---
You can get banned in public match, but if you want to fuck around in custom games, here’s how: 
---
Host a lobby with five people (standard match). 
---
Have two killers and three survivors. One of the killers must be the host. 
---
Have all players set up their perks and whatnot. The second killer must also set up his preferred perks and killer load out. 
---
When the second killer is done, he must switch to survivor. 
---
Everyone readies up except the host (who is set as the killer). 
---
Now the host readies up, and the person who was second killer must quickly switch back to killer before the countdown is finished. I believe “spectator” comes before killer, so they have to press the button to switch twice, and there’s a slight delay. The timing of the switch is much easier if you have a mic. 
---
The load time will take a little longer, but you’ll now load in with two killers and three survivors. Not sure if you can possibly have a 4v2, but I’d like to know.
---
Why not tru3 or Demi???
---
I hope so lmao
---
Peace was never an option.

Omg I love these haha. I want to get into nail art. But I'm not talented enough haha 😅. Have you done any other designs? :)
---
If you’re in scrub ranks it is a god forsaken place.
---
Don't worry dude I'll give you karma
---
Yeah, being toxic doesn't help the game at all just discourages people from trying new things. Luckily I was playing for a daily, planned to hit her with the first shot and let her crawl away until she clicked the flashlight lol
---
Thank you very much
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo

I exactly have the same problem. I love DBD, it's one of my favorite game but, as time goes by, I'm really getting sick of it. I play solo and just for fun, not trying to farm or anything, but it's really hard to find an enjoyable game. As a survivor, you have to pray for the killer to not be a camper or anything else but you also have to pray for your teammates not being waiting on a corner of the map or dc after one hit. I really don't see what pleasure you take with these kind of gameplay if you're mentally stable or not a bully. I stopped for a while a few weeks ago because I played to many toxic games at once. I restarted a week ago and, in the like 20/25 games I played, only two were with fair/nontoxic players. I just don't get why most players are playing like that and why the dev never did anything about camp (like adding a timer that pause if the killer is camping too close) or slug. I think my next burn out will be soon. 
---
Also, I thought they worked on matchmaking but today I've been 3 times in a row against the same Myers using the same instakill add-on who wouldn't let the game end until the four of us were killed by the add-on (and it took an eternity because one survivor on the ground was always going back to a locker after Myers intentionally taking him to let him stand again so he could use the kill...) One time is enough, so when it's three... As killer or suvivor, it's been a while since I played a game where other players had approximatively the same level/skills as me. Either they are way better, either they're the opposite... And the rank reset is dumb. How can I be back to rank 13/14 when I was rank 5/6 the day before ? It's quite a big gap (and what's the point of ranking if you loose everything thing every month ?)

But you don't have engineering skills-

The mid chapter patch is broken, the Halloween event is postponed, and they don’t even know what perks they are giving this week. What is wrong with them?

Nice art, text could use a little work though, I just can't imagine the doctor saying "gosh"

It's a joke. Nothing against people who have Asperger's. I don't see why we should stop joking about stuff. Any stuff. So no, we should not.

They were playing Bill so I'm assuming they had it equipped.

Disadvantaging survivors who split up to rush gens. Less warning of the killer and can't get as much use from Alert, Bond, Kindred, OoO, Hunch, etc. Hunch might last longer than it actually I don't know. Timing after letting go of gen might have to be upped.

Im talking about how these 2 goons that I tagged were trying to get a decent post that someone made shut down on the basis of politics when politics weren't even ever brought up. They're making false claim that it was politically motivated based on only the image of the angry little girl.
---
However, here's a meme that has a real political figure in it but they stay silent in their little crusade in "No PoLiTiCAl mEmEs duuuuuur." They're full blown hypocrites.
---
Dunno what to say man just try ur best and hope ur team is going to help break him out of it
---
lmao an ass clencher
---
The first one
---
I’d go with dead hard. It saved me many times especially when I know I can’t reach a pallet in a loop. I would go with dead hard if you love to loop killers. If you want to get away and play stealthy go with lithe and quick and quiet.
---
“Graphically dated” 
---
I play this game at 1920x1080 with HD resolution at Ultra Settings. You can see the individual coat-fibers and blood reflecting objects off of Bill’s back and clothing. I get 60fps easy with zero stuttering. 
---
Why the hell do people constantly complain about this games graphics/framerate? I’ve literally never ran into a snag with it, unless I’m playing my older Graphics Card Laptop.
---
I feel like I’m being hunted can confirm
---
Love how the animation budget went on this meme.
---
Wait...
---
You just hear an ominous skill warning before *BOOM*
---
Not sure if this is the same thing but yesterday I got sabo 2 hooks ritual, closed the ritual tab, opened it a few secs later again and it changed into sacrifice 2 survs as Doc
---
Good, lmao. Don’t fake sick days from School for a videogame.
---
How did he lose you?
---
That't also not how math works. You don't have the same chance of escaping with 1 try or with 3 tries. But you are correct, it's not 12%
---
I really like the 2nd one
---
I think this is a cool killer idea great job
---
Thank you! Once I unlock another emote slot I would like to get a DBD killer emote :)
---
Not sure why you’re being downvoted lmao.
---
I understand we’re all upset and disappointed, but holy shit. *”I regret buying this game/I’m done playing for good./I’m going to play other games for Halloween.”* you guys are just acting like kids who just got told “no”. I guarantee almost 90% of you will come back when the update finally pushes out.
---
*Dont stalk to me or my ever ever again*
---
Wait are you saying he looped you for 5 gens? If you're the one who stayed on him for 5 gens, that's on you for only getting a 1k.
---
Pretty accurate I'd say.
---
You should get it if you can, it’s so fun to play with. Especially if you pair it with nurses calling or any aura reading perk/ add ons
---
How dare I discuss DS in this thread made to discuss DS.
---
She wasn’t “put into a 30 year old body” lmao.
---
She’s just basically been raised in the forest as a child, with zero mental development or adult maturation, so she’s basically just a big kid who knows how to hunt animals really well. 
---
She kidnaps young girls to “take care of” and act “motherly” to, because that’s all her childish-brain knows how to do.
---
She’s not literally a child stuck into an adult body, she’s more like an adult who never grew up mentally.
---
I like him as well and watch all his streams/videos but he most definitely complains when he dies. It's fine, I do it, a lot of us probably do it. But he will make a few excuses such as tunneling and talk shit about the killer. Like I said, I like him so I don't really care. But be real, he's not perfect.
---
You can’t blame all survivors. I’m just trying to encourage other survivors to move to another if so and so happens. Camping and tunnelling is for killers who are new to the game, or get salty very easily.
---
Or maybe they’re up against a toxic t-bagging SWF, then it’s probably fine. 
---
It’s situational, dude.

They didn't say it was fine they said it was fucking weird which it would be. Why bother going to the trouble? Just grab an adult.
---
My girlfriend laughs at him and calls him the dog of the fog. She says it's funny how he sounds really excited when he hits a survivor. Me and her now believe he gets excited because the entity gives him scraps after the match proportional to how many survivors he killed.
---
We don't need another killer nerf
---
Becuase survivoes are skin and make little difference whereas killers are all unique with their powers
---
 when he played with Puppers and sattleizer, he seemed really chill. He always moves on to the next game, didn’t bother to chat with killers. 
---
When I saw that stream, I started to do the same for my self. He does complain sometimes, but not all the time. He doesn’t go on to message the killer though .
---
Boop the snoot
---
And why's that? Even daily rituals are killer sided
---
Yeah most of the time, he's cool. But he talks shit about the killer also which sometimes gets on my nerves a bit. He has a toxic series ffs, starts to become a tad hypocritical imo.
---
Killers are underpowered enough as it is
---
Girl, we really going there?
---
Yes i am.
---
The toxic series a year ago? 
---
I just thought it was cool how he didn’t trash talk killers, even if they had tunnelled or camped him. He seemed like the kind of player who likes to have fun rather than try hard or take it seriously. 
---
I could be wrong about him though.
---
Otz I want you to know that you have to 0lay THAT Legion build
---
No, I agree. But what good is it going to do waiting around in the lobby to have a go at them or being toxic in reply?
---
As I said, either they want you to react or they don't have a clue. 
---
If anything, people should educate others rather than being aggressive so that, on the off chance they didn't intend to be toxic, they can potentially learn.
---
I'm in tears this is hilarious
---
Rarely seen BHVR release things in a broken state? Are you new here? 
---
First, the game was broken at launch with questionable decisions that SHOULD HAVE rung the death knell for the game (Infinites, Exhaustion recovering during a chase, permasabo hooks, to name a few). Then, they completely botched the actual danger of being the Obsession (DS being the biggest offender and undeniably overpowered as shit on release, even if Enduring did allow you to eat it), since not only are there no downsides to being the Obsession unless the Killer is running Rancor or Remember Me, the Killer is far more likely to leave the Obsession alone. Then came Freddy, and I don’t think I have to explain what the issue with him was (Worst Killer until he got a full rework around 2 years later). The Howling Grounds Event was a clusterfuck, combining pallet vacuum with effectively instant flashlight blinds, making actually picking up a Survivor result in a high likelihood of getting either stabbed in the spine, getting the full “Now you can eat sunlight!” experience, or getting bonked by a pallet 3 feet away from you. Around this time, I took a break so I kind of stopped hearing about BHVR’s fuckups, the rejoined just in time for the absolute atrocity that was Legion’s release. I’m gonna need another section for this.
---
Legion’s release has got to be the single worst series of failures that I’ve seen since I left High School. First, the advertisements portrayed Legion as a Killer that would potentially be a mimic, when in reality, they were a group of generic stabbers with a power that is a bigger joke than they are. Next, the map that they were intended to ship with? It made everyone’s computers lag the Hell out during the PTB. Do you want to know WHY? Rhetorical question, I’m gonna tell you anyway- It had a fucking memory leak! And it made it to live, before being disabled for a few weeks until they got their shit together long enough to fix it. As for Feral Frenzy, it came with a bug that made Mending able to take minutes at a time, as well as Legion being able to moonwalk to either force a down, because the timer would only stop ticking down in a chase, which wouldn’t happen if they were doing their best Michael Jackson impersonation. Legion HAS NEVER been a mechanically solid killer- The only things that made them good made them completely uncounterable and were the results of BHVR’s code having more spaghetti in it than the entirety of Italy. 
---
Then came the Dedicated Servers being a complete disaster, and now this shit. And these are just the events that I can remember. They’ve probably done even more than this.
---
I know I'll get downvotes for this but sometimes it's good for the killer to tunnel. 3 survivors is a hell of a lot easier to manage than 4 and if they get unhooked right by the killer,  it'd be smarter to go for the injured one with less hooks to death than the full health survivor with 3 hooks left.
---
It's a bullying simulator where you can choose to be the nerd or one of the Tanners/Chads
---
Ok that was epic
---
They made decisive strike 2 😱😱😱
---
That’s ridiculous. You can definitely be smart and be in a place she can’t easily bump in, but she just needs a bit of luck. Survivors can’t tell if she’s coming from the left or right, but if u bump into her, she gets an easy hit that she did nothing to work for
---
He updates the toxic series whenever something else comes out. He also comes up with builds which are so irritating to play against. 
---
And yeah you're right, he's fun and I love watching him, I'm by no means a hater or anything. He's my go-to when it comes to DBD. I just wish he'd tone it down sometimes. He's still a legend though.
---
&gt; Also show me where this summer event was cancelled because it wasn't.
---
https://i.redd.it/9sst7zk7kbc31.jpg
---
Ghostface is getting buffed to have the Undetectable status during his sneak mode, which means OoO will not see him.
---
Wait you have to buy feng
---
Damn where's your nurse when you need her lol
---
This post is saying that survivors shouldn't take the game so seriously and you reply with 
---
&gt;  it's literally the Killer's job to finish you off by any means necessary.
---
Now I agree that a killer can play however they want and survivors shouldn't be toxic in the post game chat over it, but this thread feels very one sided.. Like the killer can be super serious and play in a way that doesn't take other peoples enjoyment into consideration at all, but if the survivors complain then its "wow stop taking the game so seriously."
---
If they could just make Moris require another hook action so that if you hooked the survivor they'd be dead anyway then it'd be perfectly fine.
---
I kind of think he shouldn't make a noise at all. Iirc, the newest Halloween movie, he gets slammed by a car and gets shot multiple times and never makes a noise. Maybe he does grunt in the older ones though? Not sure.
---
Unless their office spontaneously exploded or something similar, they must have known they won't make the deadline well in advance.
---
Them not stating a reason doesn't paint a positive picture at all.
---
It's too bad Killing Floor 2 is really not a good game, though.
---
*ALLOW US TO INTRODUCE OURSE*
---
Was there announcment for when it’s gonna be live? I was hopi g it’s like 1-2 days of delay, not 2 weeks.
---
I remember faceless Otz back in the Dark Souls 2 days
---
Then when he revealed a single picture of that handsome Spanish face
---
Kreygasm
---
I love the thing but I dont think the actual creature could work as a dbd killer. First off his power obviously has to be shape shifting but the problem is SWF completely ruins that aspect. What made him look amazing as well was the VFX, it can very easily  be ruined by making him a video game character.
---
I think RJ Macready would be an incredible solo survivor though, with a snow station map!
---
—AAAAAAAAAAA—
---
"Seismic booty clap" holy shit, that's a good one
---
Well atleast the mid season patch was released today, unlike dbd...
---
Exactly haha like I can't imagine getting THAT much satisfaction unless it's a toxic killer or something.
---
Exactly. People would switch perks to suit each killer even items sometimes. For some this would be horrible...
---
Clown/Doctor... calm spirit
---
Ghostface... object of obsession
---
Spirit... iron will
---
Hag... urban
---
Sure there are a lot more examples and some may be worse.
---
It be boring as survivor to always have the perfect perks and for killer we see little variety as it is now people would start using even less variety.
---
I completely disagree. David would kill the killer but die in the process and nea would perform a mori on anyone she fought
---
Jesus the thought of Myers getting truly pissed is terrifying
---
But then they did the 3 year special event and they didn't delay this event they changed/ canceled it.
---
I love Ghostface to death but Doctor was the easiest killer to learn the game with, primarily because his power made finding survivors easier.
---
The picture is a r/foundthemobileuser moment
---
This but without context
---
I can hear the heavy breathing of running survivors without stridor
---
Ghostface either listens to classic or relaxed country music.
---
Well I think OP meant as in don't take your losses to heart. You can play the game seriously all you want. If that isn't what he meant than I see what you mean.
---
I'm not saying for myself that survivors can't PLAY seriously. If nobody was trying to win, the game wouldn't be fun. Doesn't mean you cry and bitch about the killer's tactics. You as a survivor do whatever you feel is necessary to survive, same as the killer does whatever he feels to make sure the survivors don't survive.
---
You know what I mean?
---
Just level clown, bamboozle is good too
---
Not the division 2 :(
---
Yes, I think that daily rituals for survivors and killers should be separate. It would make things so much less frustrating lol
---
I got so tired of guarding my Hex. Not going to use them for a while
---
Sometimes it's only just one week instead of two.  This Halloween event was originally only going to be from the 22nd to November 1st, so slightly over a week.  But who knows how long it'll go since it's now been delayed.
---
2 prayer beads in a row yesterday, shes very common. Also, not once did I say she was op although now I've started playing her she does seem a little unfair. Yes weak killers need a buff but if you get ran for 5 gens then you just aren't good at killer, once the first gen they run you for goes just break chase and go for someone else
---
&gt;already injured
---
Thanks for the speed boost nerd
---
Yup. Decisive Strike 2: The Secret of the Ooze
---
It could depend on which license they get the rights to. Like how Ghost Face isn't the same Ghost Face from Scream, they've just licensed the mask.
---
I'd say it's a safe bet they'd go for the movie rights though, so that they can use Jack Nicholson's likeness.
---
No Mither sucks. It’s literally the worst perk in the game. The only perk that has some kind of synergy with it is Resilience. 
---
 But it’s really not even remotely worth it. Trust me
---
holy shit that's awesome
---
Fucking love you Otz, you have no idea. You have made me so happy so many times, and showed that this community is more than just toxicity &lt;3
---
Sorry, but it simply sounds like you haven't figured out how to play around it. You use it against the obsession to find them. You don't camp them or focus on them alone. You just use the perk against them.
---
Yes, I cant think of all of them off the top of my head but a few are balanced Landing, windows of opportunity, empathy
---
I guess you're right! I should try to patrol in the areas near the hook instead of staying in front of it. I assume it would be better, thank you!
---
I mean if youve been hooked twice and i have to choose between Freshly unhooked you and the full health Dwight im going for you
---
Thanks you saved me from wasting more bloodpoints.
---
You clearly havent been rank 1 killer then. To win at that level its avout map pressure and slowing down generator progress while hooking if an oppertunity arises.
---
Dropping a chase because it takes too long is often the smart thing to do. If you tunnel someone you will very quickely see gens popping one after the other then you get a 0k
---
No problem :)
---
Its not a good perk at all but fun to play.
---
Sometimes its used to get perks like "this is not happening" to work or for personal challenges.
---
But actually not a good perk at all.
---
Try the worst build in the world if you want:
---
No mither + object of obsession
---
I get it now and thats bullshit, what were they thinking?
---
A 4 man swf with no mither, sabo, unbreakable, and tenacity is genuinly fun and difficult to win against as killer, but its def not something youd do very often
---
Thank you very much for your answer! &lt;3 Yes, i guess i did what my guts told me to do, i'm gonna try to leave the comfort zone and take more risks to learn better :D
---
Yes. right away.
---
I would argue that the correct word is effective, not good. Judging by the amount of toxicity in the sub that play style isn’t good for the game. It obviously creates a lot of bad feels and division between players. However, it is a play style that can lead to easy wins.
---
Thank you for the answer, is there a way to deactivate the endgame chat as well ?
---
Noooooooo
---
Amusing
---
Just leave the match as soon as it's over. I dont really know if you can completely disable it as I play console
---
Ideally I understand that it would be nice if everyone played like you, and I commend you for maintaining such a positive play style so everyone can enjoy the game.
---
I don't advocate being a douche, but I understand that in a competitive game, anything goes (besides obviously hacking or a big exploit). 
---
And to add on to your bottom statement. I think that's the problem, too many people expect people to play a certain way just because they deem it fair. As soon as that goes out the window, or they aren't playing the way that's generally accepted in this community as "fair', they lose their shit. This goes for both parties as well just so that's clear.
---
When spirit is phase walking can she kick gens and close the hatch?
---
Look at the pips on top of the perks. If there are 3 of them, they're maxed.
---
Is there to see how to turn it on or if it’s off?
---
At least we're gonna get something. TF2 hasn't had any good Halloween content for a while
---
I swear to god , I just bought clown for pop and now this....
---
That's gonna help me a lot.
---
I thought this was something pure at first, like you were playing with your brother in a 1v1 and teaching him how to play. I couldn't figure out why there was the meme tag.
---
then I saw.
---
*him.*
---
It sounded better in my head
---
That person that never touched the gen if they are at full health already then please tell me what benefit it provides?
---
It's
---
1. A dick move
---
2. Not a good idea because it reduces points
---
3. You'll waste your time doing so
---
No, you have to be in normal form to perform any actions
---
I agree, they both deserve to be on the game
---
Are you high? He didn't say that, I did.
---
Console
---
Thanks fam
---
Aw well thanks so much ✌️✌️
---
I'm not complaining, I was explaining the reasoning of the people who do. And why wouldn't they be allowed to complain? Just because "BHVR is a small studio" / "The event is free and just an icing on the cake", noone should criticise them, when every patch always has problems?
---
Nah, most killers don't have 1 s tier and 1 A tier perk
---
It's usually 1 A or b tier and the rest C
---
Ye it's pathetic just about every other online game has a Halloween event going no delays or anything but a horror game can't even get it to work right
---
Ah yes, Freddy is on the same tier as an insta down killer and a ranged killer. Hot take there, bud.
---
You’re using Iron Will
---
I got my clown to 40 and now pops here ahahah
---
It's buggy when server lagging

it says that and something

There's nothing wrong with defending a hook if they're obviously lurking about or trying to lure you off.  Survivors are assholes; they'll bitch and moan regardless of what they do, while being blatant twats themselves and thinking nothing of it.

Everyone else was surprised and didn't understand what happened even though I told them. Everyone else also made it out alive

Low players in your region probably. Dedicated servers would fix this but BHVR can't seem to even do that right. I'll play 2-3 matches in a day with the same people/killer/survivors and there's no other conclusion I can come up with other than being in a region where there are few players, like I said, having dedicated servers and not making the killer's Internet the primary source would fix this bs.
---
Just bought the clown. Fug
---
I am saying that all the bitching is very annoying and makes this sub look like a bunch of entitled morons. It's fine to have informed complaints and it's fine to suggest fixes but too many people complain without understanding that they delay these events so we can have a better time when it does come out.
---
Well, there are 2 things survivors find unfair, toxic about killers. One is camping and the other one tunneling. New killers do this a lot, cause it is the only strat they know. 
---
Those survivors should’t act like that in chat. They can see your rank 20 and should just explain to you the problem. 
---
Also: 
---
1. The game shouldn’t be played by camping. Some people claim it to be a strat. But the devs made it so you lose points when staying near a hook. 
---
2. You will face killers and survivors like this until rank 10ish. 
---
Good luck and Have fun!
---
We'll probably get 1 automatically and can unlock 1 more through a challenge for free...  
---
But yeah, you're right. At least you can't get duplicates of event items and you can dump cash for the full set. So technically a lootbox but also not really.
---
I would love to play survivor as well if the queue seeking **ever ends!!!**

It was bbq and ruin back to back too. I was hoping the week after to get nurses calling
---
Dude 4 Jake Park's would fuck any killer in the game.
---
It's not wrong but as you unlock more and more perks Noed on Myers can be substituted by others. 
---
One of the flaws of Myers is obviously map pressure because he hasn't high mobility. A Ruin or Pop goes the Weasel to slow the game down just a little bit could be more useful.
---
I have a 2 minute and 40 second sound clip of the clown breathing and coughing and laughing, it makes me laugh so fucking hard when I listen to it
---
that's right. ghostface is hot as hell
---
Sprint burst is really good people just don't use it properly
---
the doctor's laughs are really satisfying to me for some reason
---
You must be getting Leatherface and Ghostface mixed up
---
&gt; all the bitching is very annoying
---
It absolutely is and people should be handling it better, no doubt about that.
---
In my opinion, people are passionate about this game, man. It's the only game of its kind on the market right now and if someone gets proper hooked on this particular type of game, if something bad happens (delays, lots of bugs, etc.), they don't just go play an another game because there is no other game like it out there. So all the suddenly unhappy people stay with the game and they complain, creating situations like this one.
---
This isn't the fault of BHVR or the players, it's just an unfortunate thing that we have to understand, or at least try to tolerate.
---
At least black holes still look better than the monstrosity that is Quentin's face.
---
I've seen a couple god tier loopers use it to bait the killer as "low hanging fruit" into throwing the game away chasing them as their friends crush the gens.  That's a pretty niche example though and isn't too common but I've seen it.
---
Good shit as always, Mika!
---
Alright 2 things to add to this! 
---
1. He is a streamer? Youtuber? He would lose al his followers real quick if he just keeps waisting time trash talking the killer post game chat. Nobody want’s to see that! 
---
2. Sometimes a killer has to camp a bit, or tunnel a player out. (After a gen rush or some toxic plays) But a lot of time there is no need for this. If you still have 5/4 gens left don’t camp and tunnel a player. You are literaly holding someone hostage and ruining the game for them. The game shouldn’t be played like that. Otherwise the devs wouldn’t take points away from killers who camp. The game is 1vs4 not 1vs1!
---
If you ruin someone’s game, I think they have the right to at least complaign about it. It is not that hard to play the better KILLER or SURVIVOR. Just don’t do the toxic plays and both sides have an GOOD GAME with a lot of bloodpoints or even a rank up.
---
That I can agree with.
---
Dead hard is the best
---
You answered your own question.  Survivors are assholes.
---
Sprint Burst is underrated. It's strong if you know how to use it.
---
But yeah, don't buy perks you can obtain for free.
---
When everyone stands out, no-one does.
---
Oh, I misunderstood. I bought all of the chapters right before the Stranger Things one came out but I've still never tried Myers (Myers, Pig, and Ghostface are still on the shelf for me). I never enjoy playing against Myers and to this day I don't understand exactly how he works. :-/
---
I feel like dead hard, but if you know you're going to a map like meat plant / haddon field then I would vote balanced landing.
---
They haven't given us a date yet
---
Doc: Zaps Trapper
---
Also Doc: You really need to stop this madness
---
You put him in tier 3 you moron!
---
Its not worth using over literally any other exhaustion other than Head On. Forces you to walk if you actually want to use it and the "fixated fix" isnt a fix since youre now using two perks just so you can use a perk without its drawbacks being so bad
---
بيع روحك للشيطان والانضمام إلينا الزنجي
---
You’ll need to be in range in order to fully reveal him. If you’re already exposed, try to look at him while in chased for removing his stealth. Otherwise, you’d fucked up..
---
I'd give gold but I'm poor. Go ask Midas, he might give you a hand.
---
I was the killer
---
Tell that to coal tower vro
---
Lol he definitely plays some gross gross builds sometimes.  Definitely the same builds he would not want to face in his survivor games.
---
Are you using calm spirit?
---
Knowing who the killer is pre-game would ruin the game. 
---
High rank survivors would customize their load-out to counter every killer.
---
Thank you!
---
Lithe
---
I don't use it too much, but I don't think it's that bad if you have no medkits IMO.
---
The way I see it, if it takes you 16secs to find a teammate and 16 for for them to heal you it's about the same amount of time.
---
SWF would absolutely ruin the ability though :(
---
I can appreciate some good Otz, although i'm more of a /u/DamNoHtmL guy myself
---
Nah this is steve when he gets hooked
---
Looks like she’s deciding if she should DC on her first down or not
---
Your welcome
---
I'm still waiting for Solidarity to be buffed to 100%. It has potential just like Fixated but the restriction makes it useless.
---
2016 flashbacks intensified
---
but most toxic swf use it.
---
that's kinda the point.
---
i think that's what OP mean, not necessarily the item and perk itself
---
A filthy heretic can't stand the true light from the heaven
---
&gt; Streetwise's numbers weren't changed since version 1.1.0 when the perk was added. (Excluding the 2.3.0 patch where all area of effect perks were buffed to linger for a few seconds) It took Behavior three years to change an (admittedly usable, but still) very weak perk that saw little to no use outside of niche builds into one that sees a decent amount of usage. 
---
No Mither is in the game since end of July 2017 and they still haven't found the time to remove the injured music if you equip the perk. Let's hope they'll give it some attention next year for it's 3rd birthday!
---
Hell yeah thats good too
---
XD
---
No but its boring, dont be surpised if people just leave if you start hitting gens

sprint burst

dark devotion

solidarity
---
I’ve encountered this a few times as well on ps4. It resolves for me after I close the game and reopen. But yeah, I don’t know what causes it initially and it is mildly inconvenient.

You can actually pull off good strategies with sprint burst. You make sure you have a sliver of exhaustion left and keep running around, then when you need it you walk for a millisecond and then suddenly you are gone.
---
Dead hard is definitely the strongest, it allows you to do so many things. Get distance, go through a killer and it is the perk that allows you to recover from fatal mistakes. Currently it's a bit harder to do so, since the dedicated servers can sometimes give you the exhausted debuff but not actually give you the invincibility frames.
---
Adrenaline is also amazing, since it ignores other exhaustion perks. So you get a speed boost AND a heal. So at the end game, you don't need to heal during the last gen. Additionally, you can get off the hook with full health, stand up when downed by the killer or even just get another free health state so you can continue running from the killer.
---
Balanced landing is great for the reasons you described.
---
Lithe is aight, but requires a vault. Easier to pull off if windows are available but you can also not loop windows as freely as it activated your perk.
---
Head on is a meme perk but it can be situationally good.

So instead of he update releasing during the half term break it will release during my year 11 PEE mock exams for fucks sake behaviour.
---
Yo is that the sun from dark souls III
---
Spine chill all you want all you can see is me moonwalking towards you with ghostface and having whispers.
---
Happy cake day! 🥳
---
I hope veteran players start denouncing this kind of behavior...
---
I've been playing just under a month and there's so much toxicity, but so much of it is downplayed.
---
If you're getting looped as Spirit you're doing it wrong
---
The irony is that most of the players don’t get a pip out of this because the killer can’t follow, you don’t get enough point from gens and escaping so basically everyone lose their time ...
---
Iam the oposite lol my mocks start Nov 1 and I have my holidays this week, big sad. I will literally never get a single game of the event
---
I fkin love NOED, not only it wins me the game sometimes, it also pisses off so many survivors it's unreal. I live from the salt.
---
The best way to deal with campers is hoping your team is skilled enough yo save you tbh but not killing yourself on hook helps. You might depip but so will the killer, he'll just waste the game away there. In the end DBD is a team based game so even if you know you're losing you should take an L for the team, it's the best way to go down and still fuck the killer up.
---
Ghostface is super easy tbh, his stalk is cancelled if you look at him long enough, and you can do this on hook and on the ground, so just help your teammates and be alert, SPINE CHILL can help a lot.
---
As for The Shape just remembered that on tier 3 he can't stalk so don't get paranoid while doing gens if there's no heartbeat, and when running try to cut his line of sight to waste time.
---
Oh Yes, now i dont need to level Clown
---
They’re memeing my dude. Those are the type of big brain plays you do when it’s 2 am and the whole squad is calling each other fucking idiots but can’t stop laughing
---
create another account, family share it.  
---
leveling up the char again is going to be a pain tho
---
Are you actually telling me No Mither is worse than Slippery Meat.
---
I think you are about 8 hours late.
---
What does solidarity do?
---
I love being an european
---
That's a seriously high quality homemade Billy the Poh on that third panel there.
---
Just wanted you to know real recognise real, I commend your artwork.
---
&gt;Sprint Burst: \[...\] you can’t strategize with it.  
---
Wrong. I'm no longer using it, but keeping your exhaustion at 1s till end was the most fun bigbrain thing I've done in a while
---
Lithe is just worthless. Has the most combos, but it's still the worst exhaustion perk out there. Most of the time when you vault windows you DON'T want to waste your boost of speed, as you want to wait and see what the killer is up to and mind-game accordingly.
---
Head On is a different thing altogether
---
The fight is only between Dead Hard and Balanced Landing
---
Dead Hard - Always there when you need it. Brings pallet vacuum back once per chase. Sucks when it's laggy.
---
Balanced Landing - Next to worthless on some maps, godlike on others. Still has use when exhausted. Turns otherwise worthless dead-zones into reusable safest parts of the map.
---
heals you partially while healing others
---
I love when killers go straight for their ruin, they just told me exactly where it was
---
Yes
---
Its the worst perk in the game, its literally just a debuff
---
Your flair scares me. Genital touture is one of my fears, not so oddly enough.
---
This is a bit messed up dont u think,i mean that the release on time surely means tons of bugs. I just cant understand why cant they give us dates when they are fkn ready with it...
---
Yeah adrenaline is fantastic. It’s just not really a perk you have any control over. That’s a valid point with the sprint burst strat, but imo it’s still kind of limiting. I mean for like running across the map it’s good but I can’t really think of any other setting in which you can just keep running. 
---
It’s not god awful it’s just kind meh imo.  I will say it’s a little better since they added fixated but I just feel like it’s kinda basic overall.
---
It's a challenge mode with no reward
---
Balanced landing for the win
---
NANI!?
---
At first i was like wtf is that  then realised i was looking at it sideways lol. It looks awesome though (now that my brain has started to function)
---
It feels like people are either all asking their girlfriends to do art shit for them, or just adding "gf made dis" to have more likes, these days
---
Thanks!
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
exactly ! i don't understand how people can be so mad, forgetting it's not machines behind the game but people, that can make mistakes or have random problem like the power outage of last week.
---
People are just entitled and even more when they are promised FREE stuff.
---
i wonder as well XD
---
It’s neither. She voluntarily made it because she also plays DBD but nice try.
---
People who make these tier lists should consider Joey, Julie, and Susie, cuz Susie would 100% be there with ghostface.
---
No one force them to do event that get us FREE stuff, but they decide to do it. People should be thankful instead of bitchy.
---
Im thinking about developing a Discord-Bot. A Killer/Surviver Randomizer with Perks and everything.. mainly for Survive with Friends.  
---
I know there is an alternative Website for that, but i'd think that most people playing SWF are already in a Discord Chat 
---
Is there a demand for something like that or would it be a waste of time?
---
Thx for your feedback
---
I mean, camping is camping, it's kinda in the word. But I'll never blame a killer for camping a hook after the exit gates are open, because at that point there is no other viable play.
---
(Unless you got Bloodwarden or NOED, which is exactly why I'll run the fuck off when a killer actually does NOT camp a hook with the gates opening.)
---
Huh, from Dark Souls 2 no hit chalange to DbD no tilt chalange
---
Every exhaustion perk has a certain use case.
---
Happy Birthday ! I was counting the days too, but problems can happen at any time and we just have to be patient, the event will happen weither it's next week or in two weeks.
---
Sigh, suicide and try to get a better group next time. :P
---
Don't worry, I do the same thing quite a lot
---
left
---
you know that it's not the same teams working on cosmetics and bug fixing right ?
---
If you have a character, leveling him to unlock his teachables is always a better choice than spending shards. This is why you should never "shrine buy" teachables that belong to free characters.
---
It takes considerably less time to grind 1.000.000 bloodpoints than to grind 2.000 shards.
---
If there's quad stacked Objects, then not really.
---
FEELS
---
Know this word?
---
I only referred to the recurring theme on this sub lately. There have never been posts like this, but in the last 3 months those posts are everywhere, and it's always "my gf drew" or "my gf made" 
---
It's also harder to criticize those posts. If those girlfriends made their own reddit accounts and posted those, they most likely wouldn't get as many karma points and positive comments
---
He just did the Prayer Beads one the other day lol.  I love him but god dammit Monto lol.
---
But usually in a swf there’s only one OoO, I’m just wondering if it would counter that one player
---
Ouch
---
yes, but with delay we don't know how long we'll wait for the patch. Toxic people are burning through instaheals. In my high rank killer lobbies 2 instaheals is average number
---
Sounds like Legion Doc Plague hybrid with extra steps
---
I like it tho
---
Run across the map to a gen, do the gen and let sprint burst reload while on the gen.
---
But yeah, I agree it's takes way more planning than other exhaustion perks
---
Cool. You do you.
---
Maybe only one thing is bugged, but the thing is Archives / Rift and event are all linked to each other, this is why they can't release on without the others
---
It's for the luls
---
I never bought anything off shrine of secrets,i always bought the character with the perk so i dont just skip a whole killers fun! as a survivor idk im a rank 20 survivor and a rank 3 killer xd
---
Just UE everywhere til Sprint is needed?
---
Hey guys, so I played this game about a year ago, got Claudette up to 40 because I was told self care was OP and needed to get it teachable ASAP. I recently started playing again, and have loved being killer, it's a blast even when I dont get a single hook. 
---
So I leveled Hag to get Hex: Ruin, and now I'm working on Cannibal for BBQ and Chili(just bought him on sale). I also just bought  Pop from the shrine, as I keep hearing good things about it. Would these 3 perks + No One Escapes Death be a good loadout for Demogorgon? I'm a huge Stranger Things fan and loved the Hags mobility, and Demogorgon seems to be a more proactive version of that. 
---
Also, any tips for utilizing Demogorgons power? I would assume I should set nost of my portals and keep one or two handy so that I can actually jump between them, right?
---
Hope you're hourly. But still the suck is coming.
---
A cracker of a comic well done
---
The boys and I were all so sad about this one. I hope it doesn't take long...
---
and won't work on Wraith (and other stealth dudes) once he (they) gets (get) undetectable
---
Not only Survivors. It‘s just unchallenging, boring, easy and since everyone‘s leaving not even rewarding playing as Spirit.
---
This doesn’t make any sense, Halloween happens on the 31st it’s not “just a date”.  You don’t see people going out trick or treating on the 26th because they want to. If BHVR actually cared about the community they would keep us updated on the matter but instead they told us on the day of the event that there were, “unforeseen circumstances”, and then go ghost. Free items or not, this is a game that people paid for and put in time to support not only the game but the Devs. They need to get they shit together, period.
---
Better value to level them up anyways.  Save your shards for DLC perks from characters you don't own or cosmetics.
---
Also bonus you got Object of Obsession out of it too and that perk is fun as hell.
---
I dont know all the totem spawns either but the more you play the easier itll get. Just gotta keep playing and putting hours into the game.
---
I tend to cleanse because as a killer I see what happens when nobody does (spoiler: I 4k everytime). The trick is to use the most uncomfortable fountains first and then go stealth mode when she powers up, which is easy since she had go in remote corners of the map to do it.
---
So glad I quit this game. Can't imagine how disappointing it must be for you guys to not get the biggest DBD event of the year during Halloween. BHVR once again showing their incompetency. The saddest thing is, people will forget about this and continue to support them which leads to them continuing to be incompetent.
---
Yeah but a boost when the killer finds you isn’t that useful. You don’t need the boost really if you’re paying attention. You need it to fight the bloodlust.
---
I can see that working but personally I find myself stopping often when I’m looping pallets so I think I’d find that limiting.
---
honestly, the lore is more interesting to me than playing the game, so I'm super hyped about the archives
---
Maybe as a very rare addon.
---
When all gens are powered, Myers loses his terror radius and this music starts playing.
---
Lol, have you read spirit's lore? His dad did that to her, by cutting her and throwing her through the window. The entity didn't do nothing to her.
---
This is me with Wraith dailies
---
cant belive i had to scroll to find this
---
I found myself upvoting the comment claiming Balanced to be best and the one claiming Dead Hard to be best.  They're both right lol.  Honestly those two are pretty much top dog and it's a matter of personal preference as to which someone prefers.
---
Lithe is solid but window hitboxes are dogshit.
---
I like Head On but it requires Quick and Quiet in order to be effective midchase.  So that's 2 perks down.  Still solid though.
---
Sprint Burst I agree is for the newer players.  Having to walk to preserve the cooldown just seems wasteful to me in a game that is essentially time management.
---
“Communitu”
---
I disagree. she was a drug addict, a self-harmer and showed symptoms of depression and BPD. I'd say she's another victim of a cruel world that oriented her in the wrong direction. she was already really fucked up, her life went downhill long before Jigsaw. he was like a light in the dark for her, so she learned to embrace the sick games and torture.
---
damn you didn’t even spare the one unlucky bastard brave enough to stick around.  you deserve the bp losses
---
something normal, it happened to me so much times against streamers i check their POV, somoething normal is hapening there , while im getting hit 10 feet away on my end
---
Tbh you are being rude, not him.
---
Nice assumption based on absolutely no evidence. I think the game is pretty balanced tbf. Sometimes you get stomped and sometimes you do the stomping. Its a competitive geme of course people are going to try to win. And ill refer you back to my first comment, cya.
---
By adapt he means be forced to run Iron Will or die lol.  I finally caved and replaced my Small Game with it out of literal necessity as she has ZERO counterplay once injured without it.  If she can hear your groans of pain it's over.  You can "adapt" your playstyle and "mindgame" your scratch marks all you want.  She will simply follow the sound in their headset and either clean phase hit you outright or worst case end phase 2-3 steps behind you.  It's not balanced but it's necessary guys.  Just bite the bullet and run Iron Will.
---
Amazing work !
---
Ace: *wins through pure luck and bullshittery*
---
"You're awful BHVR."  
---
"How am I awful?"  
---
"Delaying the event."
---
Survivor main here, she got exactly what she deserved. If the exit gates are powered, get out. Simple.
---
Describe in detail how you are juking a Spirit with a headset without Iron Will.  Go on we'll wait.
---
Dont play then, angrey. No one is forcing you. Wait for the update release, take a break in a while and do something else, whats the problem.
---
still better than losing the game. 1 cleanse is enough to kill your entire team.
---
Are you sure about that? Test it again maybe? Cuz thats how it used to be in the PTB. You could turn your cam and reveal him and that was to easy. Cuz it never works if i try it. I have to literally stop and turn my entire body towards him to reveal him
---
My friends tend to be toxic pieces of shit to killers.
---
Usually I can cool them down, convince them not to be toxic, however, this one time...
---
We were playing against a leatherface, the guy played well, he didn't camp, didn't tunnel, he didn't have ruin and he didn't have NOED, all of us made it out alive and yet my friends decided to click their flashlights and T-bag at the exit gate as well as giving the killer shit in end game chat. I was desperately trying to defend the killer in end game chat, but my words of killer encouragement drowned in a sea of toxic messages.
---
I was honestly pissed at my friends, saying they "just created yet another omega spirit".
---
Next match, we got our ass handed to us by an omega spirit, I was never so glad to be pulled off of a gen, my friends deserved every minute of that match.
---
I agree with this change but it won't do much against her.  She'll still require Iron Will to have counterplay.  There's really no balancing that with her kit unfortunately she just kind of is what she is.  
---
Along with collision though Prayer Beads absutely needs a rework.  Most broken addon in the game.
---
Consider whether your brain has your best interests in mind?
---
Basically, youre causing somebody to die because youre doing something that makes them easier to hit or gives away their position
---
More in depth verion from the sidebar dictionary: 
---
Used to describe survivors targeting their teammates and playing to the killer's advantage by bodyblocking another survivor in a chase to get them hit, throwing down pallets in front of the chased survivor to block their path, making noise by fast vaulting windows or pallets near teammates to let the killer know their location etc
---
Oh yes, this would be great
---
The ds costs you pressure though, if you leave her underground someone has to get off a gen to get her up.
---
How is it supposed to counter ooo? It only passes your terror radius to obsession, doesnt blind them.
---
Do you mean not closing hatch to prevent EGC from starting in a 1v1? If there's a 3-5 gens left and the person is standing in the hatch without closing it, that kind of feels like holding the game hostage if the survivor doesn't decide they just want to die
---
Gets stunned by pallet 
---
Continues screaming about it for 5 minutes
---
Because OoO is based on the terror radius, if you’re inside the radius you can’t use OoO to see the killer, so passing on the terror radius to them would counter then in theory
---
The Thing dlc would make me reinstall the game tbh
---
Iron will* the other is for crows
---
Gifs that you can hear
---
I think killers also need to understand it’s literally the survivors job to escape by any means necessary.
---
that means they can use insta heals and OoO and keys and whatever else is in the game to do so lol
---
Agreed.  They're broken cheese.  But to be fair and consistent we should be willing to acknowledge that moris are the exact same thing for killer side.  Both should be part of a joint rework down the road.
---
HEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY... I just finished leveling my clown 40 yesterday to unlock it.
---
Made me chuckle
---
How to identify a potential murderer. 
---
Step 1: Present this gen to the suspect 
---
Step 2: Observe
---
If they fix it they are good to go. 
---
If the kick it send them to the Crotus Prenn Asylum.
---
Calm spirit prevents you from screaming
---
i guess it depends on the country. Here, in France, there are almost no one trick or treating, and Halloween isn't just one date or day but more the spirit of Halloween through the month of October. 
---
The date ISN'T important, the way to celebrate it before or after the 31th is.
---
I've got to say I'm kind of proud of the responses on this thread.  People commenting seem to be pretty fair and sensible about their answers.

So far it's pretty much all keys which are basically survivor moris so super cheesy, Object which while a fun perk for me to run sometimes in survivor games I can totally understand it being referenced here as the sheer amount of information provided can be insane especially in a swf, insta heals which even the devs acknowledge were broken and are reworking as we speak and certain map offerings like Coldwind.  I can't really argue with any of these responses.
---
For a post asking for responses from killer mains about what survivor mechanics are OP you guys seem to have handled this one very sensibly and level-headed.  That's pretty impressive for this sub.

I’d honestly love for a killer with an actual human face
---
We have human killers but they all wear masks
---
Just a normal looking guy.. but when they get a lil entity in them.. they get a little cookoo!
---
Must be a bug I guess
---
Oh, I never played it on survivor, I didnt know it is disabled within tr. I usually play freddy so Im used to be helpless whener I face it, you know. I forgot it is different on ther killers. You should test it in private match with your friend to find out, I suppose if nobody knows. You come across ooo as killer quite often I presume if you want to counter it?
---
Seems like it's only a bug with the event items that are exclusive to the event, the Feng dress you can get in the store so it's not really exclusive
---
Frankie boy kinda quirky doh 🤪
---
epicccccccccc!omfg!
---
This guy's so nice and altruistic he deserves a good car, a good house, a wife and a dog.
---
Its way too big to keep pressure as killer unless you're billy.
---
Nah I’m actually pretty new to the game only been playing a couple of months since ghost face was still in PTB, I rarely ever get OoO at my rank (green to purple) but saw dark devotion in the shrine and wondered if it countered OoO
---
I would have The Thing be able to attack while cloaked, immediately uncloaking. I think since you can only sprint at 100% movement speed it would be balanced, so survivors could just run if they think you're the killer. It would also tie into The Thing's theme of distrust.
---
Also, it could morph into the last person hit.
---
Seems about right! Thank you!
---
Take my upvote
---
And i assume they should actually try to do gens if they see a killer "camping" an hooked survivor
---
"OoO is the lowest skilled perk in the game"......
---
*NOED sitting silently in the corner "Am I a joke to you?"
---
Do people actually expect a “middle of the road” level dev team who constantly make mistakes and lies to their community to suddenly do a 180 and be a regular, well-managed, good dev group? To be honest I’m shocked we even are getting new killers regularly. With their continuing track record it makes more sense to expect delays then content
---
I want the thiiiiiiing
---
Otzdarva can Barbeque my chili anytime, anywhere.
---
That's exactly what they should do
---
If they see the killer camping and they go for the save anyway, they are playing into what the killer wants and they will end up trading hook states instead.
---
The only correct play (and one that makes the camper quit camping) is doing gens and escaping.
---
joooooooooob soooooooo faaaaaarrrrrrrrr
---
Dont mind toxic comments. Its your game, you can play it like you want
---
Thicc boi
---
then it does help for those who dont know how to loop or handle themselves? see it has its niche
---
I would main the shit out of MacReady
---
Read that as "fancy pants"
---
Tbh I'd put Plague in Huntress tier
---
A lot of players can't judging by the loadouts I routinely go up against.  I've always made a point to play with weaker addons to not grow dependent on them but a lot of players go the hard opposite way on that front.
---
&gt; I do play sometimes, but if someone criticizes what perks I use or something I did in endgame chat...
---
Hide endgame chat, disable profile comments. You don't have to listen to some internet randoms.
---
not remotely fresh bait
---
If you know how to hide, and have a good build with it, it can be rly good, definitely not the worst perk
---
The thing with Rj is not getting enough love on this thread
---
You are able to heal yourself while healing someone else by 50 %. Not that great of a perk you rather go for sprintburst. For killer perks take PGTW.
---
Michael should have his own tier. He got shot like, 97112 times and still did not moan once, but is able to OOF when stunned
---
Indeed, at some point they attempted to rescue the survivor right in front of my eyes, that was a big mistake :/
---
How are you boosted if you’re rank 20 lol
---
Just wait until they give the Legion a gun 8]
---
Here comes the traper
---
You just got outplayed
---
# I think we did a pretty good job so far

You're right \^\^ I felt pretty much excluded seeing people talking me down since i am a noob.. but now i recognize my mistake and i decided to better myself instead of listening to insults

Nancy?

Destiny 2 is on the same exact boat
---
Here is the math for anyone interested:
---
To gain 2.000 Iridescent Shards from level 1 to 17, you need 31.020 XP. Considering you gain an average of 400 XP per match, you'd have to play **77 matches.**
---
To gain 2.000 Iridescent Shards from level 50 to 57, you need 29.400 XP. Considering you gain an average of 400 XP per match, you'd have to play **74 matches.**
---
If you start at any level, the total XP to get 2.000 Iridescent Shards is always between 28k to 30k [Player level rewards
---
](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1411397835).
---
Now, playing killer with nothing but BBQ and averaging 25k bloodpoints per match, you get to 1.000.000 bloodpoints in roughly 20 matches. Even less if you start using 100% bonus offerings or come across survivors using party streamers.
---
Holy jesus i forgot i was on reddit pls make more i beg you
---
Wow they’re the same games I played before and it was my gf who persuaded me to get it, what a coincidence. Welcome to the community.
---
I would switch out NOED. It’s quite a weak one perk when compared to the new ones. A few tricks for demo is to use your shred ability to make the survivor try and dodge it thus slowing them down and allowing you to get an easy hit. There are good demigorgon tips on YouTube too!
---
Fungoose provides much better content at actually teaching new players I think.
---
Nightmare Before Christmas style!
---
Dead Hard
---
Cool
---
This is now a meme
---
Well done for stopping to work on the gen after failing the skill check! You're on your way buddy.
---
this comment will get downvote to hell i know but i'm still saying this. imagine calling people thrash, boosted, stupid because of perks or items yet people still call you wholesome. got nothing aganist this guy, he can play or say whatever he wants but this weird circle jerk cult try to market him something he is not is really annoying.
---
I think I need a repost
---
See I've heard that about noed, but just I'm the last 3 or 4 days of playing again, I've secured 4k games like 3 times with it. I rarely get no kills because of it, I usually managed to snag at least 1 or 2 extra

He didn’t said he quit because of a delayed event.
---
oh, I didn't actually know you could hide the endgame chat! though also I wouldn't wanna hide it permanently cause sometimes after nice in-game interactions I wanna talk to the people I played with
---
unless you haven't played in months and you got to brown ranks
---
It's impossible to pip without farming with them a bit or making intentional misplays
---
League players too
---
Amazing!  I'm hoping issue two has the doctor's patience wear thin, and we get to see his true power.
---
The thing is they want you to tunnel them so they can be salty in an attempt to make you salty. Just ignore them and let them follow you around like a lost puppy lmao
---
Due to unforeseen circumstances we have messed up the shrine of secrets, its all insidious.
---
oh hey, that's really cool!! I also main Nea and that does fit with her
---
and that ties in with me liking the characters and lore, I kinda get to roleplay internally then
---
thank you &lt;3
---
during special events are bloodhunts always came with it?
---
If all 5 players agree to it, then BHVR would let it go...
---
"See all of your Killer friends"
---
Old school cool
---
I read that in his voice
---
Honestly this is a super let down.
---
honestly all they need to do is remove her ability to hear while phase walking she'd be balanced. her speed while haunting combined with the ability to hear makes tracking survivors who have already been injured incredibly easy. 
---
the big issue i have is that most of the mindgames that come from the phasewalking  mechanic are 50/50 coinflips. either the spirit tracks you down and gets the hit, or you got lucky and you punish her by gaining a tiny bit of distance.
---
that's not even considering pallets against spirit. her mechanic essentially elminiates 99% of safe pallets in the game because of the uncertainty of not being able to see who youre trying to avoid. and at higher ranks pretending to phase is another 50/50 mindgame where the worst case for the spirit is to phasewalk and get right up the survivors ass again
---
she doesn't get punished enough for not predicting where survivors are going to go, unlike nurse who after using her blinks gets a hefty cooldown.
---
when the best counterplay to a character is to equip perks in the case you run into one specific killer, you know theres a problem.
---
Came here to say this. Kate's definitely a fighter
---
It doesnt necessarily need to shape shift it can transform into a more powerful Thing the more it hits all it needs is contact. In the movie it shapeshifts to get to the rest of the world and survive the temperature. In this game it wouldnt need to but if it did yeah swf would ruin that.
---
Noed on Mike isn't a bad idea. He's not always insta down. If you is use infinite t3 and NOED then yeah thatd be dumb
---
Sometimes I just point at them when they’re on the hook when I play survivor. I haven’t played killer too much to see toxic survivors during that gameplay
---
Only on consoles. 
---
Pc player have to buy a spark of madness.
---
thats every game ever tho
---
The hooks just call his name lol
---
Can confirm
---
Make Your Choice is terrible for Demogorgon unless you're running a basement build, in which case, it's OP.
---
I prefer a pallet shredding build for Demo. Ruin/Spirit Fury/Enduring/1 free slot Franklins, Sloppy, Pop, STBFL, BBQ and (Bamboozle?) all work well. I'm honestly still experimenting myself but so far Sloppy has been a favorite of mine. I haven't really been sold on Bamboozle with Demo, his power sort of beats the need for it, but it also shuts down jungle gyms &amp; killer shack instantly.
---
For your power, just place it next to gens and try to get them activated ASAP. If you're running BBQ, try hiding some of the portals near a gen so you can get surprise hits. You can honestly 3 gen pretty well with Demo if you're struggling with chases.
---
Same!
---
haha shirtless myers is so funny and relevant haha
---
Head on = meme, rarely actually useful, needs other perks to be used better.
---
Sprint burst = good to avoid first hit when the killer suddenly  appears, often used in the wrong situation and wasted for the chase not usefull.
---
Lithe =  great for gaining distance in a chase. Can be used whenever you want.
---
Dead hard = needs right timing to avoid hits, can be used to catch pallets before getting hit or avoid traps. Sadly almost useless when the killer knows you useing dead hard. Many good killers expect dead hard and wait until you waste it, when they got the time for.
---
Balance landing: you need a higher area to use it. Buffs landing slowness even when exhausted. Great to gain distance. Opens a window for new loops you cant do without balance landing. Can be used whenever you want.
---
Adrenalin: only 1 use per match, sometimes you cant get to endgame, you are not always able to trigger the perk when you want.
---
I would say balance landing is prob the best exhaustion perk but you gotta be a lucky with the map. Because its the only exhaustion perk thats still useful when you exhausted and makes you able to use certain areas to your advantage.
---
Sometimes i use lithe balance landing and dead hard together. Very cool combo that gives you a lot of different options in a chase. Also as a killer i never except survivors to have more then 1 exhaustion perks except adrenalin.
---
Thanks man, nice to hear some positive reinforcement for spirit mains such as myself
---
im more worried about the fact that after you physically saw the killer running after you, you kept walking instead of immediately running, like the killer is just going to stop and not hit you
---
Does that also apply to lullaby for the dark, the last breath and of flesh and mud?
---
&gt; Keep in mind Ghostface has no counter to looping whatsoever
---
Except hiding your red glow can turn a lot of loops into 50/50s
---
Here comes the Trapper
---
i do think there needs to be a few arcade modes that branch away from the main game like this just to mix things up
---
YOUR FASER AND YOUR FASER TONAIT TONAI HAHAHA YOUR FASER AND YOUR FASER TONAIT
---
I want to know where people are finding these 40-50 lb pallets. Every one I've ever come in Co tact with was like..20 lbs at most.
---
Last breath was a
---
Ways free, same with lullaby in the dark. But yes consoles also get of flesh and mud for free.
---
*inhales*
---
*sigh*
---
Funny thing is, we've heard from Valve that more people are working on **Artifact** now than TF2.
---
*Fucking Artifact*.
---
I think that in a lot of ways, that's due to circumstance and her connection to Michael that only strengthened as time went on. and the fact that Michael wasn't powered by the entity then.
---
the mans was slow as fuck, let's be honest. without the entity he was just tier 1 all the time
---
Per u/McLean_BHVR, paraphrased from [here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/43653/aim-assist) - 
---
Auto-aim isn't really auto-aim. What actually happens is that there's a "detection zone" in front of the killer, and if the survivor is in it when the attack happens then the game will move players to make it look more like a hit just happened.
---
It logically follows that it can get funky when latency is involved, and may get *super* funky if there's something between you and the survivor.
---
Yes to make up for it being overpriced you got hag+doc for free
---
12 hooks. I wish they didn't die on their first.
---
What's more terrifying is that Myers doesn't have the capacity to be pissed, only to overcome and kill.
---
Ay keep at it man hopefully bhvr wont touch our blueberry gal.
---
Ebony mori? Yes, it's an Albany expression.

I love the strategy behind the game. On the surface, it’s a simple cat and mouse game. But as you climb the ranks, you learn the meta and more advanced strategies. 
---
I love the skill and knowledge you can develop playing this game.
---
It is possible because of sleep doctor which is a continuation of the shining so there is a chance
---
by that logic nurse must be one of the worst killers in the game
---
He’s having internet issues at the moment, but I believe Monto said that he’s in the process of moving and will be back in the next few weeks.
---
once the game stops being scary you just want to have funny cosmetics. i support this idea 100%.
---
Sadly, that's how scammers work. They profit from people like that. How these scammers can sleep at night is a mystery to me.
---
so... im a myers main  what should i get. that or pop
---
shoudlve called it "trapter 1"
---
you go far away and they still dont get saved? maybe you're in a 5 killer lobby
---
They screw up every event, DLC, anniversary, and have multiple leaks. And when confronted about this they shrug it off and never answer a question. People have every right to be upset and have no reason to be thankful. The dev's room peoples hard earned money and release a glitchy game and show no remorse about it. More people should be bitchy
---
Nah not really play however just you don’t get any better by camping
---
Youbdont seem to understand how things work so yiu probably should stop talking. You really believe that their office suddenly exploding is the only possible unforseen circumstance?
---
The problem there is that while you may be ranking up another survivor who is doing their best looping and doing gens while you are off in a corner self careing doing the bare minimum to pip is de-pipping because they end up being 1 or 2 hooked. Everyone playing as optimal as possible means everyone gets to rank up not just you.
---
I really like detail in the Stranger things map. The hooks have rats on them, there's that rattling cage, there's 11's isolation room (Complete with a broken wall from where she killed those men) , and of course that room with the portal to the upside down, and the elevator that leads farther down to even more growth. And the Exit Gates that open in a unique way, just like the first episode of Stranger Things. They really did it justice.
---
Don't bother trying to expose Ghostface if you aren't competent to win the chase against him.  I see so many survivors who are more interested in revealing me than trying to escape me and they end up taking a bunch of free hits.  On that note if you hear Ghostface use his power while you're in a chase watch out behind you because he'll most likely try to outwit you at the pallet.  Again spend less time trying to expose Ghostface and more time getting the fuck out if you see him stalking you.
---
yeah, exactly
---
he's acting like he's a bigshot villain cause he camped in a video game and people are downvoting him
---
I love that moment of despair when they look at you after fucking up that bad
---
Played back in the closed beta and played for a good amount on release. Took a long break until Doc came out and have been playing on and off since.
---
Fair enough on the broken promises point. I was more thinking that by "broken promises" you meant something they said would happen and then just... never did. I didn't really consider delays past due dates to be a part of the umbrella.
---
But on the point about the game still having alpha issues, that is indeed misleading. While this is only an anecdotal point I have not ran into a single bug in my time of playing in the last month. In fact I could name the amount of bugs I've ran into while playing the game for well over 1000 hours on my two hands. That is far from broken as it's easily on par with the bugs I encounter in other games and not at all representative of the statement "issues like an alpha."
---
If you are talking about issues in the game design that's a different conversation. But the game is definitely not any more buggy than the average game on the market today.
---
It’s Laurie for me. She’s so loud
---
Don't you shame her.
---
well at least tru3 is a bit more direct with his anger, which i can respect that, whilst otz being passive aggresive. trying to justify his toxic moves as "because you have this, because you have that". i know this game is not easy to be chill but still, people shouldn't praise you for not being any different than other toxic people.
---
Bond/Iron Will/Balanced Landing/WGTLF
---
I'm so used to Bond at this point I feel blind without it, one of the best survivor perks in the game if used to it's full potential.
---
Iron Will I could live without but it's great when you're not running SC or bringing in a Medkit.
---
Balanced Landing is IMO the best exhaust perk in the game. It's the only perk that's still useful even while exhausted. 
---
WGTLF is what it is, get them blood points! If they ever buff it up to BBQ comparisons it'll be 99% used.
---
Different is one takes some amount of skill to use unlike hitting a skill check button without a skill check and insta downs take a heavier hit on a killer *sure u can run infantry belt + insta hatchets* but besides that it is still more fair than *boop*
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave? I completely agree with you.
---
We've all been having a blast in Identity V the last few days. It's crazy fun 0
---
It'd be a start, although No One Escapes Death is a perk that does nothing until the end of the game - you would be better served by picking something that will give you a stronger advantage for the duration.
---
Otz has a basement setup worth exploring [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-qix4OYfzU).

Give them a break all right. It wasn't an easy decision and i can see significant amount of releases within the few months of joining
---
She left after two kills, then scratch marks stopped appearing so i still lost 2 vs 3
---
I like standing there and waiting for them to check and see if you sneaked past them and just staring at them lmao
---
Now all i can imagine is Myers saying something and an entity spider-arm thing covering his mouth.
---
Ghostface would sing *DK rap but every noun is replaced with coconut gun.*
---
Don’t give a damn about escaping but it’s garbage if the killer doesn’t farm if someone leaves immediately as it screws over the other survivors. At least let people farm first. I’m fine with being killed after farming but it’s asinine to berate survivors for wanting fair compensation due to a shitty teammate. I do this myself as killer as what the fuck is the point in playing against 3 survivors off the bat?
---
That disappointed sigh ghostface does when he gets stunned
---
Most realistic.
---
Of you have a video proof, you can report him on the website and get him banned
---
Which is precisely why I believe Bill can defeat Suzie.  The entity will let them get the hope of surviving the fight, and hell, maybe he’ll just Kill Bill at the end to help out the killer, but Legion ingame isn’t too much of a huge issue.  They’re weak compared to the others.  Now compare that to Bill.  I think it’d be a pretty close matchup to see them fighting.  Maybe the Entity wouldn’t let Bill win, but without any Entity Intervention, as this tier list suggests would happen, Bill’d definitely win.
---
For April fools they should make her scream and curse in russian
---
Why did I hear the chase music when he said « Oh I love to chase you »
---
simply she is a low IQ killer who has a huge advantage than any other killer in the game which is beyond broken.

are you really saying the spirit is balanced LOL. she is not and ill bitch about it like the nurse till she gets nerfed. mark my words slut.

---
Lol I wasn’t talking about iron will it’s garbage against spirit I meant spine chill or premonition, and if your complaining this much about spirit you should probably run it because you’ll need it. You can loop every killer other then spirit except nurse so you don’t really need perks to counter those because there’s no perks that help in looping. FYI you can run a build to counter spirit AND nurse because their the strongest killers in the game
---
While I reckon this is a *little* far fetched, I want to say that perhaps Ace would be one higher on this list. While his lore doesn't specifically say that Ace got into any fights or won them, there are some implications that Ace got tangled up in the Mob. For instance, when his lore says "he racked up too many debts with the wrong kind of people", I want to say that would be Mobsters or Loan Sharks. 
---
Not to mention how the map he shipped with was a Swamp map, and it could be inferred that Ace had an encounter with The Hag. Mostly, from the wounds on his legs, and the claw-mark on the back of the Grey Tux Jacket. 
---
Whether or not Ace won that fight, we don't know, but I think Ace clearly put up a fight, if his wounds are any indication. 
---
Iunno, though, that's just my thought and theory.
---
I get most of my 4k with her. not in every other killer since I don't play killer a lot which makes me think. I'm good ? or the killer? I'll let you answer this one.
---
why doesn’t he fight back? oh right the entity would probably subject him to endless torture
---
I would disagree, she did receive a nerf but her core ability is still to ignore walls and pallets. A good nurse can still shut down a swf lobby better imo than spirit
---
UwU whats this
---
*The Legend*
---
What is the point in playing with 2 teammates off the bat? Kill me quickly so I can go to the next game. I have no interest in farming.
---
*cries in Trapper*
---
I stand by what I said. If your moving in a way that predictable you are not a good survivor.
---
Too loud :(
---
lmao chill
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
I wanna wape spiwit
---
I wanna get her weally dwunk and wape her
---
If a survivor intentionally working with the killer and it shows, then it is considered sabotaging the game and in theory it is a bannable offence. Not sure if any proof except for video recording would be accepted though.
---
If there is... let's say... 5 streamers or an event or someone wants a specific achievement and both sides fully consent to what is happening.... I mean... never heard of anyone getting banned for it. Had these games myself in double BP days, had speed limiter Billy's, Huntresses who asked us to help with achievements - nothing wrong in that. Everyone got points, everyone maxed out, everyone are happy. 250-300K points in one go is no joke, I tell you that.
---
Usually if people don't want to take part in farming games, they just rush gens and escape, others stay for extra chases/altruism points.
---
Pop is a big gen regression perk, so if you are having problems with gens, get that. If your good with gens, get dark devotion for the Immersed experience.
---
As a new player who only bought the game because of the youtubers and Stranger Things DLC, wow.
---
The official wiki, it had a list of all the splinters and which ones were retired. I might be wrong I haven't checked it in a while.
---
As a survivor main I can confirm instaheals were stupid and didn’t belong in the game, keys however are still VERY powerful and I think might need some tweaking
---
Bing bong I now call this meeting to order

Sauce?

Somethings , at least on ps4, I dont think are even worth the time. I see 'bug fixes' and it be like "fixed action where legion jumped over pallet .5 seconds too fast" and I be like who even found that?
---
Oh wait never mind, I rechecked the wiki and I was totally wrong.

In the context of this tier list, the entity wouldn’t stand in until the end of the fight.  Bill probably would be fine with getting tortured if it saved someone he knew.  He was fine with getting brutally ripped apart in The Sacrifice.
---
Please. Devs have to make money. Having played an sload of MTG, poker, actual P2W games...yall are on one.
---
Don't get me wrong, this is excellent work right here, but, there's a few things I'd like to point out that makes this story... Incorrect.
---
First, Erman Carter... Is an asshole. Literally. He is portrayed as your typical nice Doctor that just want to help but that guy is a lunatic that (even tho he perfectly understand how the human mind work) just wouldn't have an appointement with anyone like, not as his current state or anything. Which makes this whole situation VERY unlikely to happen.
---
Second, during their fight, The Trapper is shown as the powerhouse that is stronger than Doctor. Once again, the Doctor is no normal doctor. He is actually taller and bigger than the Trapper. The weapon he use is a blunt weapon that require more strenght to deal dammages than Trapper's cutting weapon.
---
The Doctor is actually just as physically gifted as Evan AND he has his electricity to assist him on top of that, which, gives a huge disadvantage to Evan given the amount of metallic stuff Evan has on and in his body that makes him a living lightning rod.
---
Also The Doctor is pretty insane himself and would fight back rather than flee.
---
Don't get me wrong, this is awesome... But, knowing the fact that The Doctor is your favourite killer, I'm actually quite surprised you didn't portrayed him better.
---
Are we gonna sit here all day
---
Lol one time I was playing trapper for no reason and then in the middle of the match or something I get a trapper daily and I’m just sitting there with my lvl 1 trapper like what? Then I took the daily cuz it was 30k
---
I think it’s goal was to be a similar perk to flip flop, it just has a bad perk to bad it’s
---
Self on.
---
That’s something I’ve never heard before Droms killer
---
With him chasing the car, I do believe it is.
---
It's like cell division.
---
I agree on the hard skill check, but only if it eats the add on, not the whole med kit
---
You can slug a DS though very easily
---
anyway i think it talks about any killer
---
Still waiting on dauntless event and this 1 -.-
---
I guess
---
really? i have seen franks mostly
---
Okay, they need to delay the event. Fine. But why not turn on a bloodhunt in the meantime!? If they cared about their community of players, they would do this. At least it would calm down all the upset people who took time off to play. Really poor decision making by the people in charge.
---
Incredible
---
why does a botanist know how to repair a generator
---
1. Yea, especially in the end-game with an open gate
---
2. Do you even read? Or have you never seen someone with DS enter a locker next to you? if you take them out, they'll stab you. You can't do anything other than eating the DS or leaving the area
---
turns everyone on the match deaf while youre bing-bonging
---
I stopped watching his killer gameplay after he claimed he only did certain builds to “collect salt to bathe in.”  After a while a lot more of his videos were like that, and I don’t condone salt chasing.  It ruins their day, not funny, in my opinion.
---
You know what’s funny? One of the challenges for the archives will be sacrifice all four survivors in the basement. Now, what are the odds this will happen again? 
---
Cool, nonetheless.
---
goddamn the killer perks on these shrines have been tasty recently.  
---
after i just finished levelling them all too :(
---
He's literally the polar opposite of a graceful opponent. If you destroy him, he's gonna get shook and complain about how he's not having fun, say something about strong items in post-game chat, complain about how strong perks are, etc.
---
If he beats you, he's gonna post a 36 minute youtube analysis of it. 
---
Highly enjoyed that stream from a week ago where he got totally annihilated for like five hours straight. Culminated in him being the most emotionally affected person I've ever seen in a video game and then he proceeded to play omegablink Nurse with an ebony mori to "prove a point" just because people brought a couple insta-heals to his games LOL.
---
Sorry guys, not allowed to bring items anymore apparently. Otz needs to impress his army of rank 20s.
---
Or you just have a different opinion then the other person
---
Why are people downvoting you?  Oh right, “He said something I don’t like so now I’m downvoting AAALLL his comments!”
---
swf memeing
---
No it doesn’t, you have to get a new item during a match whether it’s from chest or from other survivors
---
Very cool
---
If iron will is doing it that’s a new bug. It was always calm spirit that did it once the removal of screams with the perk was added. Outside of the perks if it’s still happening it’s a bug
---
Can legion, hag and the other short killers reach that one?
---
But you pretty much mentioned the changes. Pain pills is the new syringe.
---
Nurse and Spirit. The top tiers.
---
Claudette would just hide &amp; watch the fight from afar
---
Yaaaaaa, buddddyyy!
---
Give him antlers and a Rudolph nose
---
Are you drunk or under a substance sir?
---
What?
---
*Laughs in Iridescent Pin*
---
Ghostface can though so in the end who's REALLY the best stalk killer
---
T posing Pigs are not bugs
---
This. Simply turning on a double BP in the meantime would've been fine.
---
Where is this from?
---
The closest term in your native French would be "sabotage". L'action de désorganiser et de compromettre le succès d'un autre survivant.
---
Also, in some cases, une pratique malhonnête qui consiste à jouer intentionnellement au-dessous de son calibre réel.
---
I don't know, but they do it 2 times faster with a toolbox.
---
well if you had Laurie anyway it’s pointless wasting shards on DS. Save your shards for licensed killer and survivor perks. Other than that save up for the unlicensed characters themselves as wasting iridescent shards is pointless
---
Allow us to show you the butt-dancing passed down the generations.
---
Swfs destroy every semblance of balance this game has anyway. It'd still be super fucking cool, even if not very viable.
---
It should definitely have a really good secondary ability to make up for it though
---
Sorry, I corrected my comment.
---
I'll be honest, a large portion of DBD content creators are just outright awful. If it's not negativity/whining, it's being a dick or just involving themselves in petty drama. Otz is one of the bigger ones that isn't really like that
---
Holy shit that'd be awesome
---
Its like they want to fix the bugs they know exist in the event and archive update before they release it and worry about the ones they dont know after
---
You are the Keanu Reeves of Dead by Daylight and we love you.
---
Thank you! I really love that pic; I imagine that’s what a survivor sees a second before they’re Mori’d.
---
Dead by Daylight AND Destiny
---
I'd concede getting rid of ebonies, bit the rest need to stay. They give the game a sense of urgency for the survivors when one of their teammates is suddenly gone.
---
Devs, its their fuckin job
---
i mean i literally cant argue with that, ghostface now officially best boi
---
Thanks 😊
---
Ghostface would definitely be plenty coherent, he masqueraded as a writer for several publications, you gotta have an idea of how to do words properly to do that
---
i did about as much testing as BHVR usually does so im not sure c:
---
Funny enough your post history has you literally roasting him out (in bullet point form) like.. a week and a half ago "he was a whiney 11 year old Indian voice" and now you're here just stirring the pot again.. if you don't like the dude,  you don't like him, but my god you talk about him a lot.
---
Yup as I recognized three comments ago thanks guys lol
---
He's Spanish and he says he learned english through some of his Irish friends iirc.
---
Yes it should have and no I’m saying it didn’t come out on time for dedicated servers and I know they have been talking about them since last year damn dude Ive been around here for more than a min, BhVR Interactive doesn’t deliver anything on time and if they do it don’t work!
---
No, there was a pretty common bug that would delete your save. He asked the devs for his legacies back, and he never got them, so he just gave them back to himself. Then he got the ban.
---
Fortnite’s black hole still following me man
---
This meme is gold
---
It might be the different platforms we play on, but the amount of Myers definitely exceeds ghostface lol
---
He was complaining about otz not dressing properly for his streams (?) and mostly for once playing hag with noed and putting like 5 traps around him. I actually saw a match like that on otz' stream (it wasn't going well) and the meg being trapped was some russian dude who had a total meltdown in the post-game chat, listing off a series of mostly  incest-themed insults. From his comment history guy who commented was a) russian b) perma-angry so that checks out
---
Nope, it puts the required perks in the shrine.
---
I can't wait for chapter two
---
ITT: thirsty boys and thirsty girls
---
i’d say your lucky in my opinion as when i close app it doesn’t work i’d have to probably do it for a good 30mins before getting any luck then after that game, back to the same process and that just kills the fun. i’ve deleted the game and redownloaded  it, hopping on now to see if it fixed anything i also sent a ticket to their support team, so maybe things might be fixed before the event.
---
Did you play in the Summer at all???? I'm actually going mental here. You can check for yourself or use your memory. It was literally two months ago. They. Did. Not. Do. A. Summer. Event. They cancelled it. There were some skins released, maybe you're thinking about that? There was also an anniversary event. But there was literally no Summer event. How can you even have it in your head there was one?

They also DID give a release date for dedicated servers. Look dude, you are just blindly defending them if you ignore both of these things so I'm gonna move on from this conversation.

---
Dark Devotion is LEGIT. First game with it got first hit of game on obsession near 2 gens, chased a smidge, looped back to one of the gens, OHAIYOINK! Mm mm mmmmmmmmmmm.
---
This is gonna be fuuuuuuun
---
You're totally fine! Sounds like a pretty good build and I'm glad to hear it's working out for you.
---
IMO Spies is a pretty good tracking perk, but I wouldn't swap it into your current build if you're having fun and getting use out of all your perks.
---
I hope you have fun as Huntress! &lt;3
---
My least favourite bug on dedicated servers is the gen grabs. I go to grab someone off a gen and it doesn't register. I save up my map offerings and addons to play scratched mirror Myers and it happens way too frequently :(.
---
are the dedicated servers even out yet? i honestly don’t know
---
DWIGHT FUCKING D I E S (NOT CLICKBAIT)
---
Would be a bit OP tbh. The only way I'd see this working if it was within the terror radius (or smaller) of a killer or if they specifically trap a specific locker somehow.
---
Also, once people know you have iron maiden they stop touching lockers altogether usually
---
Best I can do is Freddy
---
While we are at it let’s make it so if a survivor goes near a locker they get sucked in and instantly killed
---
Devs release anything -&gt; \*autistic screeching\*
---
Should have at least 100 T-Bags lol
---
Him and true are the man in dbd love watching gotta show some love !!
---
So now we have to go to the main menu to switch between killer and survivor, *and* the bug is still here. God fucking damnit.
---
The keyword their being sometimes
---
The high ranks aren't any better, but don't let the toxic players bring you down there are some wholesome nice people as well
---
It's all good. I get that sentiment, it would be great if the perks were more rounded and balanced like a moba, so we have more "viable" options to play with
---
no. shirtless clown &lt;3
---
Pretty much.
---
*Boyers
---
We love you otz :)
---
So... you've just killed Head On and that Nancy perk, nerfed Quick'n'Quiet, buffed BBQ (which is already "controversial")...
---
"Just don't go in lockers", right.
---
It would regress to 0
---
Bold of you to assume claud would even be seen by the killer
---
Ez clap
---
4Head
---
If After 10 sec you don't have the survivor, chase another one. You Can take thiq one later
---
25% every time
---
Yeah she belongs in a "Survives but so does the killer" category right above where she is now
---
I def think you should try it I think practice should do the trick but ty 🙂if your interested in seeing my other designs I post them all on my Instagram @gamingxgoddess_nails. I been doing nails for 2 years and it’s such a fun hobby.
---
Yeah I feel the same way about killer perks.
---
I picked up a few from the shrine when I first started playing because having them all at 50 seemed like a loooong way away (and still kinda is) but I don't any more.
---
For survivors though, I will pick up a shrine perk if it's pretty much the survivors only good perk and I have no interest in playing them.
---
Ty
---
Will do sir 😁
---
Which side is the nerds?
---
Well, it is a regional dialect.
---
Mostly this one 
---
Due to then getting new devs so fast their coders did things differently so dbd ended up with "spaghetti coding". Its honestly a miracle this game even functions
---
And like every new thing added somehow messes with the audio levels
---
I wouldn't call that a counter. It only works for 30 seconds and you have to hit the obsession, which means that player is in your terrior radius anyway.
---
The two possible outcomes is you keep chasing the obsessions, then dark devotion does nothing at all, 
---
Or the obsession runs off while you do something else.
---
The obsession will go heal some way or another and after that the 30s are most likely done and you are back to square one.
---
Ty 🤩
---
If you pop a gen it always regresses to 0.
---
Well, if its a random object with no pallet near, keep following them and hug the object to maximize distance, and only swing when you get close, as they will try to make you hit the car. If there is a pallet, then there are multiple options. You can go straight through to close as much distance, and risk the stun. You can also stop just before the pallet to avoid the stun. As huntress, you need to practice on predicting what they would do. If you wind up a hatchet, and they throw down a pallet, they are still long enough to hit them. The same goes for vaulting. If it is a difficult pallet to position at, let it drop, try to get the normal hit, break it and move on. As huntress, while chasing survivors, try to steer then towards vaultable areas, wind up a hatchet in preparation, and sometimes they will fall for it. At higher levels, survivors will avoid vaulting while you are near, and try to juke. The best option during this, or any situation, is patience. They can’t keep spinning without you getting closer, where they will need to run straight. I hope this helps
---
Satisfaction
---
Spine chills pretty decent and underrated. Resilience can make for some good gen speeds. Iron will can be useful with resilience too. Quick and Quiet can be great for breaking chases if done right, but if done wrong it can harm you a lot. Inner Strength (you might actually count this as semi meta but it's a really fun perk) can get you some quick heals when you need them, provided you broke a totem.
---
I used to be a big tru3 sub but gave up on him. If he could find a way to drop his ego, he would be such a more enjoyable streamer. He's the reason I started playing the game, and where I learned everything that I now know.
---
So perks, specifically for Demo, I feel: 
---
NOED is generally seen as a bad perk because it’s cheap/dirty and teaches you to be lazy. You don’t have to work hard at the end game, etc. I think it’s fine until you get a better one, and it is fine as an In Case EGC And I Have No Downs situation, but in general a stronger perk is better. 
---
Make Your Choice isn’t bad for Demo b/c he can port back easily, but it’s not consistent, it hinges on being far away and then finding the unhooked rather than focus down those doing gens.  It’s riskier. 
---
Save the Best for Last: Decent perk but This can be better on Demo b/c the idea is to hit someone normal, recover very fast, and quickly shred for down. It has the benefit that sheedding the obsession doesn’t cost  stacks. So it does benefit Demo a bit more. 
---
Nurses: Great perk but better for Demi because when you use your TP you can see healing auras that are in range. (Unless they changed this recently). Nurses pairs with sloppy nicely.
---
BBQ good for demo because he can cross the map. 
---
Enduring+Spirit Fury? Enduring maybe IMO spirit fury is wasted. You should almost always just shred at a survivor running at a pallet. You’ll most likely either hit them or shred the pallet unless they get it perfectly timed and you get hit first, the enduring saves you. But you will imo get the hit or killed pallet more often so even enduring may not be necessary, ymmv. 
---
Pop: Good but great on Demo since he can get to any gen fast with portals. 
---
Monitor: I like this perk a lot and I think Demi benefits because his lunge gets him closer and also his music isn’t as obvious how close he is. But coming out of a portal shortly drops his TR briefly and this is a Ymmv case, you could lose this perk. 
---
So in general I’d run Ruin/Corupt, Pop, BBQ, and either Enduring, Nurses, or STBFL. That last perk depends on if you want more aggressive at pallets, faster downs, or want to hunt injured.
---
Oof, I'm surprised the survivors didn't leave if you guys were seriously trying to kill them and not memeing. 2v3 with Nurse and Spirit - I can't think of a more enjoyable experience lmao.
---
Wait, do you *not* know what “A daa mi kaa din gia, asa po meer” means?
---
So if the gen is 99% and u pop it it would go down to 74%?
---
Just me playing DBD 😏
---
Personal experience.
---
I can respect that.
---
Not true. The Thing could spawn apparitions similar to how doctor madness does, but not apparitions of the killer, apparitions of other survivors in the trial. Getting to close to them could cause them to "trigger" and reveal that they're a thing clone where they act like a hag or trapper trap.
---
A SWF trying to confirm and communicate their clones and their locations all the time would be a lot of talking. 
---
Then there's also the possibility that the Thing killer could infect survivors in some way, such that the survivor becomes a Thing carrier without realizing it. Get too close to another survivor and the trap springs.
---
I bet he has a really deep, sexy voice.
---
*GHOSTFACE BIAS INTENSIFIES*
---
This sounds more like a tru3 video, do you have a link?
---
Yep.
---
It's impressive that you pretty much replicated his art style on your fingernails
---
..... Ok.... 😳
---
Dont go there then
---
Your secret desire that you never knew you wanted
---
Ghostface sorta can I think- it’s not great, but it kinda works if I’m not mistaken. If he crouches, however, he fits perfectly into the other hole (and I’d imagine Pig will as well then).
---
Pale rose, and it is nearly everyone's goal to fire up the gen on the boat first just to hear the horn
---
I think he’s high on OwO Beer.
---
And if it was at 25 it would go down to 0?
---
Survivor body block me all game and blocked a window freddy got me and I died so I messege freddy where he was and he died instantly which felt amazing
---
this could have all been avoided if they didn't announce they were going to change instas way before it happened and survivors started using 2 or 3 a game before they get nerfed
---
Ok ty
---
I see the delay as a sign that they really, truly care about their community. They’d rather polish their content, risking things like this, instead of releasing buggy piles of shit. God, I love Canadians...
---
Not sure whether they have this sentiment.
---
But yeah, it's accurate at the core. Then again they buffed Freddy a little while ago and now he's a god tier killer and people are done with him too, so either way people complain ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Touchè
---
We can bring broken add ons to a game but the killer cant. Surv Cry baby logic
---
I’m a survivor main but I feel like you had every right and I find this hilarious. Some survivors can be toxic. I usually wait at the gate if I’m escaping so the killer can get at least one more hit before I leave but I don’t tea bag for anything. They had it coming. 👌🏼
---
Np, I'm not camping if that's what camping is considered in this game
---
Isn’t unbreakable kind of a waste since No Mither has it built in?
---
The moment I saw this on Netflix I knew someone had to make this.
---
Iron maiden is good where it is. A good perk which can cause survivors to panic and make mistakes.
---
The spirits were "helping" Jack throughout the later half of the movie. They were the spirits of people who stayed in the hotel in the early 20th century, so it wouldn't be possible for him to have killed them. I never read the book, so I don't really know what their motivation was for manipulating Jack. 
---
Also, I would argue that SAW was a psychological horror film (in addition to being a gore fest).

I agree, it would be very strong on Killers like Freddy too (Surge +  Surveillance is already very good on him). But still, the current Surge is very sad. Too many conditions to work. I think they could remove or rework at least one of them still.

I played 2 games yesterday. First one I decided I want to try a different perk than Ruin. 3 gens lit up 2 minutes into the game when I was still chasing the first survivor.
---
Second game I put on Ruin. Was clensed literally in the first 20 seconds of the game because a survivor spawned right on top of it.
---
Fun times.
---
**+7000 Common Fruits - Otz will reply to your Reddit comment.**
---
Lol no.
---
Dbd would if BHvR wasnt just EA lite. Most of this game is dlc, the shrine is a shit system (seriously bbq has only been on there 4 times) so people feel forced to buy the DLC, the grind is so fucking long I basically quit playing because causally playing this game just doesnt work. You either grind for hours and hours a day or you make little progress.
---
The devotion system sucks because it auto prestiges resetting the rate you earn shards and you dont even get a bonus for grinding out 100 devotion which is definitely not a afternoon activity
---
All of this in a PAID game, if it was f2p then fine sure put all the $10 skins you want in but it's not. You buy 3 skins and you've already matched the cost of the game, now count in the other 30 skins, DLC and now archives
---
Corrupt is pretty good
---
I know what happened.
---
They pressed the reroll button but it changed again without showing them, just like daily rituals.
---
I love Corrupt Intervention as much as anyone else, but that perk only buys you space rather than a lot of time. If survivors stack up on generators and get early gens done very fast (which can totally happen) you might be forced to defend a VERY awkward 3-gen strat near the end of the game since the more distant gens did not get completed at the start. Certainly not a flawless perk that you can just run and forget about.
---
Menu music, chase music, killers and survivors screams, the creepy feel of the maps, that sound when a match starts while you’re spinning in a circle, anything that gives me a boost in bloodpoints, grinding to a million BP before an event/new chapter.
---
if that was the case more people would do that and your queue times would be really long which is already the case majority of the time..
---
If you down you might as well hook anyway, so Pop is great. Surge mostly just hits 1 gen, and the survivors can easily tap it before you even hook the dude. And Pop is not reliant on having to use a basic attack,and you can choose which gen to kick, and it regresses more 
---
Pop is so much better.
---
True. But seeing them nerfing pig instead of doing something with the prayer beads on The Spirit doesn't seem like a reasonable idea. 
---
Freddy indeed is a lot stronger but nothing broken. I guess there are always those entitled survivor mains complaining about every little thing.
---
"It's not a bug, it's a feature." -Our Lord and Savior, Todd Howard.
---
Guess you're right. i just feel bad for the devs at this point lol
---
Demi strats:
---
Addons: the strongest are rat’s liver and Mew’s guts. One recovers you faster from a missed shred, letting you close distance more. The other lets you move faster when holding M2. Why this is good is that it gives you more momentum so your shred goes further, and if you let M2 go without shredding you are closer than you would be without. Beyond these, Upside down travel speed is the strongest addons.
---
Shred
---
You can use it to hit people as they are turning a corner, so good for longer loos. Demi destroys the shack loop. 
---
As I said, shred at survivors close to pallets, you should likely either hit or kil the pallet. 
---
Shred covers distance fast, you can use it to close in after a hit. You can also go far by shredding off a high place but you can’t hit anyone lower than you if you do. 
---
Portals
---
You have a limited number and only get them back if cleansed. If you put a portal next to a gen, that portal is useless when the gen pops. So don’t drop them too casually, at least at first, except maybe to cross maps, or strategic gens (a gen on an upper floor/hard to get to place like inside a building). Don’t put them by hooks imo, it’s wasting a portal and when they unhook, they’ll be gone by the time you pop out. 
---
Portal use: putting it next to a gen will tell you if someone is on the gen when you M2 but they’ll see you emerging as you TP. If you put the portal around a corner/behind a wall, they won’t see you and the TP mutes your heartbeat briefly so you can surprise them on gens. 
---
When Demo starts to TP, hiding survivors near you will feel safe and run right to a hook/gen/gate, since you’re leaving. A nasty trick is to TP to a very close portal and double back. 
---
Demi is great when gates are powered but no one’s opened a door, b/c he can quickly TP between them. If you think a survivor is close, use the trick right above.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel is an amazing perk and will reward you for doing well. But Ruin rewards you even more for doing absolutely nothing which is the thing that really baffles me.
---

"Shhh... you are not allowed"
---
well you need to fully heal someone. which means you will have to find someone else in the first place, that is also injured.
---
You choose, DS or slug
---
I think it might be better if overcharge applies to it. It is definitely in a position like no mither, though, as it requires the use of other perks to fully utilize it.
---
How long had you been chasing that survivor when the generators popped ?
---
It’s better to invest points into a character than spend shards on one perk.  The exception is if you can’t afford that character.  
---
I prefer spending shards for BP when a new chapter releases.
---
Don't forget it stacks and every person you hit (besides your obsession) increases it even more. Especially on some M1 killers it is amazing, because your slowdown in a chase is cut down a bunch.
---
Especially in a game as DBD where 30 seconds can mean a completed gen, cutting down on downtime and ending chasers sooner is massive.
---
That’s Becuase in solo q you need to be able to have self-sustain Becuase people don’t like helping you

Yeah , true I’ve seen many streams that plod a person supports spirit people aren’t much talking about it but in streams who don’t like her I start seeing many comments yeah nerf spirit , she’s op yada yada , if they are gonna nerf spirit they first need to fix those infinites and BL on haddon field , almost every time I play killer there is a abusable infinites with almost no mind game and you have to wait for that window to be block , they really need to remove those infinite’s plus give killer a kind of buff to have better map pressure on very huge maps , spirit can easily move very far distance with her phasing while it takes other killer a long time if they really want spirit to be removed from the a game they need start to balancing stuff for other  killers .and their kits aka BUFFS
---
That literally nullifies inner strength
---
I'd think I'd rather have reskinned generators and hooks than people throwing games...
---
Thanatophobia and dying light are very weak: for thanatophobia you must keep all the survivors injured for a minimum slowdown and Dying light causes an even smaller slowdown and requires a lot of hooks (sorry for bad english)
---
Bruh how is wraith moderately painful
---
I don't see how going against him would be fun for survivors and his abilities lack skill expression
---
People would dodge ruin if this was the case, in which case it becomes way to easy to deal with. Additionally the skill checks are the only interesting things while doing any M1 action.

But people refuse to use it use cuz NOT META
---
He’d have such sights to show us
---
I appreciate the help man. I'll definitely try to apply all this against him today.
---
I think that people misunderstand the use of ruin, but gen speeds make it difficult to play this way. For example, play as trapper with ruin, set up traps, ruin is cleansed, start the game prepared.
---
huntressses is probably how'd i react to a giant wooden pallet being slammed into my face too
---
Interesting. I suppose this good for killers like pig, Michael, wraith? I just feel there are better perks to supplement. Plus you those 30 seconds you save can be undone if you find the obsession and have to disengage from the chase to keep the stacks
---
I made a post about GhostFace doing this in a public match in his PTB, he understood my rabid pointed and crouched into [position](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bwqoxg/good_to_see_the_ptb_is_bringing_people_together/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Then you decide to vault the nearest window which was what he trapped all along (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)
---
How does it become easier, it just means if you come off the gen as a skill check happens you can do the skill check instead of the gen just blowing up
---
Dedicated servers. 
---
21 ping to the datacenter.
---
It's really inconsistent so maybe it's better if I just try to loop him instead of focusing so much on his ability. What do you think?
---
It would go down to 74 instantly, then regress to 0. The gen regresses to 0 until a survivor taps it.
---
This. GF is great at mindgames.
---
*nootes
---
Sold*
---
Its weird to hear myers utter any kind of vocal sound, I would be more in character for him to be completely silent
---
Exact same thing happened to me. It's really good, but it took a second to realize
---
You should make more! This is amazing!
---
Moris after 1 down not even a hook were fucking amazing. Imagine the salt it would create with these modern post chat salty survivors
---
What if it gave a mend timer when you left the locker but it was shorter then legions mend
---
Camping is good in some situations and bad in others. Once you know what kind of survivors you're playing against, your choice will be much more obvious.
---
You done good kid.
---
That’s common
---
That doesnt sound too bad
---
Unbreakable is 1 time you can recover when downed, no mither is unlimited time, well up to 7 times, with unbreakables recovery speed it becomes upto 10 times in a match. Ive been able to recover from 1 hit hatchet huntresses upto 4 times in a single match cause she kept trying to slug
---
So no testing alright got it
---
O Canada.... Something about a maaaaaple leeeeeeaf...
---
The movie was garbaaaaage.
---
Keep in mind Surge is also good for time management. Say you down someone- they’re fairly close to the gen they were working on. So now not only is it already regressing by more than usual, but you don’t have to go over and kick it- you can just hook the person and move on. It’s a little bit of time taken off, but time is very valuable as Killer.
---
Though Ruin is far better.
---
when he takes a bit too long to tier up
---
You forgot "however we are doing a pretty good job so far"
---
Yeah I agree 100%. Wasnt too sure since I don't have pop atm (but will get it in the new shrine)
---
In a week or so. It'll last the same amount of time.
---
i dont think it will replace self care or medkits since you dont need to do all the stuff i listed above. instead of you can instantly start healing yourself with a medkit and selfcare
---
So nothing has changed. Toxic survivors have always used those mechanics and still do. Regular survivors who play fair aren’t suddenly toxic for using OoO and/or instaheals. Toxicity hasn’t increased, just the frequency of players using OoO and instaheals, which like I said earlier, isn’t toxic
---
Though any rational company would have battery backups at all their important workstations. I mean... it's practically a requirement at all the offices I ever worked at.
---
I do love DBD, but I completely understand being frustrated again and again by Behavior's constant rookie mistakes. You can love the game and even Behavior, but by now we kinda all know they are not a professional game company and more like a bunch of amateurs who hit it big with their game design. 
---
Yeah day 1 DBD is LEAGUES better than what we have now,  But that doesn't give them a free pass for constantly screwing up. 
---
 You can still be critical of someone and not outwardly despise them. Even though it's the Internet.
---
Poor Myers
---
True, it is very easy to work around. I guess I just like the “ this game will not end until this perk runs out” aspect of it. It would definitely work on killers with high pressure, though. Then again, so would ruin... Damn Im dumb.
---
Everyone needs to tweet the fuck out of bhvr and dbd on Twitter and blow up the forums to disable these trash fucking servers. It is killing the game no pun intended.
---
Anyone who sees No Mither and still slugs obviously isn’t very good though, since The Who point of the perk is anti-slug. I really don’t see this working at high ranks
---
Like cmon right? It’s so easy to understand!
---
Then your good.
---
The thing would be an awesome idea!
---
r/Paladins
---
Eh, don't blame survivor mains. Let's keep it positive.
---
I think the biggest issue is that BHVR doesn't want to make it a competitive game and thus doesn't really do proper balancing.
---
I do agree with the first statement.
---
"We got our programmers to make two things at the same time. The code for said things got so intertwined that we simply can't release one without the other. Yes, we only just caught this the day before releasing it. No, we don't know when you'll actually get it. And NO! We WONT be giving you a double bloodpoint weekend to ease the disappointment, get over it!"
---
Did I ASK for you to spit in my cornflakes?
---
No, rarely.
---
But in the past the events themselves usually gave bonus points, not sure how it will be this time
---
Oh thank fuck they explained what went down though. I was really sad that it was delayed but now it's not really a problem cause ain't nobody gonna be able to beat random weather/power problems. 
---
Also I half hope we get some more adorable bugs that don't do anything bad like that weird shuffle you can do sometimes.
---
Very true. Then again pop is foever, ruin is not. Plus in a SWF just have one person run small game and ruin is gone within a minute or 2
---
As I said, happened like 2 minutes into the game. 
---
It takes 80 seconds to fully repair a gen without Ruin. They simply all started repairing a different gen when the game started and the killer cannot really focus on 3 survivors. I found the first one, started chasing him and as I downed him and picked him up the gens popped. 
---
Was it good spawn RNG on their side? Sure. Could I have downed the survivor more quickly? Yeah. But against a good survivor you don't easily down them instantly at the start of the game, whereas it takes little skill to do a gen while the Killer is chasing someone and no gen hate is active. Playing without Ruin often gives you similar results when gens just get popped before you manage to do much as Killer, and all the slower perks like Dying Light or Thanatophobia come into action when there are only 2 or so gens left.
---
For some reason I’ve always dreamed of possessed Regan from the Exorcist being in the game but can never think of what her power would effectively be. Perhaps the infamous demon crawl that makes her move as fast as Billy and one shots in the same way? Perhaps she could be like Doctor where she does something ranged that creates some fear meter?
---
Of course the survivor would probably be one of the priests and the map be similar to Haddonfield with the infamous Exorcist house. Chase music would obviously be the theme, too. Weapon could be an upside down crucifix.
---
&gt; I've never met a pallet I couldn't pick up
---
Wow look at the pallet man over here humble bragging. Alright, since you're a pallet's man and all, how do you even go about picking up pallets you've just met? Got any advice? "MEET HEAVY PALLETS IN YOUR AREA" or something?

---
omg, I wanna do the 2 killer glitch (on a private match of course) and get the right sized killers for both
---
do you think hag or nurse is short enough for the taller one?
---
Finding my friends is easy and thus I would never have self care or medkits anymore since we can now heal 2 people in the time of 1.
---
Add botany or we'll make it and boom, you now heal 2 people in 15 seconds
---
I feel like this is all developing teams. Its really hard to fix something that could litterally break if you remove 1 letter from a line of code.
---
Probably hag would be better because nurse is all floaty. Good luck though! Also link me a screenshot if you do!
---
Ive only reached as high as rank 8, and got to work there, but really selectivley
---
Certain killers are better at preserving stacks. Pig and Demo, for example. They’re secondary attacks do gain/lose stacks, meaning you can freely attack the obsession with the secondary attack and save all 8 stacks
---
Well, you'd be sacrificing generators then
---
It's more of an issue with trapper.
---
He needs to start with a default bag and 3 traps and have add-ons to increase the number.
---
That would make him way way way more viable
---
that was very good.. plz do more .. add the cute baby claudette too if you could  :P
---
I mean I guess but according to the community spirit is too right now. What does SWF mean though do I can understand what your saying.
---
You don't need to disengage when you find the obsession, you just use a secondary attack. That is why STBFL is useful on killers like Pig or Demo, their charge doesn't take stacks away.
---
Not to mention STBFL is also very useful in the engame if survivors swarm you and go for the unhooks. You just cut them apart with little cooldown.
---
A thought experiment: What if every perk was as strong as Ruin, but could be cleansed?
---
I apologize if i was spamming them, but i only posted 3 songs? If thats spam then i guess its spam. And there’s a difference between copying someone and being inspired. I’ve always wanted to make a wraith dbd song but never had the motivation till i saw Jon Robs song. And I’ve talked to the guy personally. He’s a nice guy. Difference on why he takes longer to makes songs is because he makes music for game developers and is busy as hell. I dont make music for a living. I do it for a hobby. I can imagine how hard it would be to keep making music over and over and then try and make something original for a character after all the music you’ve done. I’m not saying his songs are bad, theyre well done. But it’s difficult to make some original every single time when you make 5 or more songs a day for video games. I understand if you don’t like my taste in music, im completely fine with that. But its kinda odd to argue with people who like a song. Its opinions against opinion
---
99ing Gens is a great way to apply pressure to the killer plus it is also a way to prevent certain perks like NOED and even Bitter Murmur if you are willing to go that far. Plus one thing other comments forgot is 99ing gens also makes the pig extremely useless since the timer of the trap doesn't start until after a gen is poped giving the survivor with the trap much more time.
---
99ing the exit game is pretty much the same thing, counters certain perks and prevents the countdown to death.
---
Shrine stuff is too expensive :(
---
Yeah

Best I can do is dream snare Freddy

I really hope at some point we start seeing Survivors as Killers and Killers as Survivors.

Jake as a Poacher, Claudette as a toxicologist, and so on.
---
It's still going to be buggy.
---
Okay... and? Just gitgud.
---
Myers upfront, where he fucking belongs
---
It's always been good but underrated, Otzdarva uses it a lot which might be popularising it.
---
Has anybody else lost their lunar cosmetic shirt from David?

Seems like my friend lost his cosmetics from both Feng Ming, David and the Huntress, did I miss an update saying they would be removed from players or something?

---
Nobody is making you walk to save it. Unless I see a gen right nearby, I'll just waste it and a lot of the time I'll have it ready when I need it.

The fact you just suck at countering him doesnt mean he needs to be cut

---
Sprint burst is good if you know how to use it.
---
I'm new to the game.
---
Why in half of my games the other players don't unhook me? It's because I got hooked fairly early in the match, so they think I'm a dead weight, or they just don't care?
---
It's a bit frustrating.
---
I do totems, generators (got better in those skill checks) and unhook other players. I'm still bad at chases, but I was able to lose the killer a few times (it's so fun when it works).
---
But to die in the first few minutes of a match because no one bothered to unhook you sucks.
---
That's the weird part. It's a glitch. I didn't even buy anything in his bloodweb
---
Your vids are super educational.  Great commentary!
---
no, i just want the putrid flowers event from last year, with the vials. that should be every halloween
---
Dude, the other day I was playing trapper for a daily and managed to hook someone in the half of the map I have trapped, right in between the 3 gens, get 1 kill 2 DCs and a hatch escape 
---
“Wow, nice camping, get good at the game shithead, couldn’t even 4K.”
---
Like, dude. I’m literally playing the one killer that can’t go away from his area, what the fuck do you want? Me to just eat every pallet on the map because I’m a mile away from all my traps?
---
this just means the spooks wont die earlier than others we get more days of spooks in dbd
---
I don't remember BHVR owning us anything just bc a event got pushed back but also why would BHVR want to give us anything after how people shit talk them lol
---
Just to name a few
---
Self Care was whack
---
Infinites and jungle gyms were common
---
Killer vault speeds were snail pace
---
Pallets and windows "vacuum" survivors when vaulting
---
Hooks dont regenerate so Sabo was meta and survivors were slugged for the most part
---
Its just a few off the top of my head as
---
I wish my demo could make use of surge+ surviellance(which i use because i like losing) but noooooo only basic attacks do it and its once every 40 fucking seconds
---
I realy hope when they release the new update and event. It isn’t filled with bugs. People will lose their mind here on Reddit.
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR i jst have this page bookmarked so i can check each day if theres an update
---
wow you are getting downvoted so much while its true, that people on console are more casual players. I have seen red rank gameplay from console on youtube, and their movement and decisions they make are like green ranks on PC. Additionaly if they are rank 20... situations like this video happen quite often.

I chase a Feng who was injured, she tried to vault a window, but froze for 3 seconds. I downed her, then she quick vaulted the window and went down distance from the place where I downed her.
---
Froze by the window
---
I hit her and got her down
---
She does a quick window vault
---
Goes 5 metres away from the window
---
I was confused lol, then again I remembered it was lag. I just let her go. I felt bad.
---
I don't think anyone actually wonders why every single Killer runs Hex: Ruin.
---
What people are actually wondering is why Hex: Ruin has to be so strong that you have to run it unless you actively want to gimp yourself (or you are called Hybridpanda or Otzdarva).
---
2 blendettes in lobby, game starts, first gen i go to i find one of them, hatch throw she does some spinning around and gains no distance, gets downed and hooked in basement. I run up the stairs and see marks aroudn the killer box so i find the other blendette immediately, she still runs to the basement and unhooks her friend but gets downed. Both dc immediately. Just a minute later i have one of the remaining survs on hook, run towards one gen on the side of the map and see a gen pop on the oppsite side so naturally i have to pass by the hook again to get to the surv. I see him coming and down him before he even reaches the hook and end the game. This is the salt i get.

---
Get off my lawn! Lol
---
It honestly doesn't make sense why they would add the basic attack requirement like, are you trying to make this horrible on some killers BHVR?
---
Ruin is extremely overpowered in low to mid ranks and a minor hindrance at high ranks. That's the problem in balancing this game because gray to green ranks are literally the worst survivors to play a game and purple to red could put the Navy SEALs to shame.
---
My wild tin hat theory is that they’re trying to avoid Modern Warfares launch.  It’s a bad time to release your first battlepass/semi-content.  Unlikely, but potentially a smart business move even with the backlash.
---
Don't forget the hooks
---
Well isn’t it the game against other killers like example wraith or GF where they can go stealthy then get a hit  later ? Yeah spirit can get a hit on you first then use her power but you can use perks to counter her , but like I said in my ted talk people don’t like you against her because it doesn’t fit the meta if you have spine and iron will you can fully counter her when she’s phasing but it’s not a perk really needed to counter her but it’ll drastically help against her
---
Love these people as I know I have at least 1 person not doing the gens. Which imo is great news.
---
No apostrophe needed
---
God, this sucks so bad. Why are you even getting put with SA people?
---
It should be double the current speed and you don't have to open the exit gate, just crash through leaving a meg-shaped hole
---
Hahahaha

Anyway i love your videos
---

---
Mans about to get hit with so many downvotes people complain that it’s op already
---
Clown has 2 good perks though. Worth imo.
---
I don’t think you can throw down an illusion pallet, doesn’t it disappear when you get close?
---
easy, toxic cuz apparently anything the killer does is toxic
---
I really, really, really want to like Pig, but nearly everything I want in Pig is present in Myers' base kit. I went from an uncomfortably high rate of 0Ks with Pig with decent perks to consistent 2-4Ks on Myers with just a handful of kinda meh chase-ending perks. Not even mentioning the incoherence of Amanda's addons.
---
I'll never reach top tier, so that's not my issue, but it feels really bad to see the sudden jump in performance.
---
There is counter play against her but people refuse to use perks that can be viable against other killers but since it isn’t meta people refuse it
---
Yeah, sounds about right. Dont bother man just play the game you want to and let them be dem salty dogs they wanna be :p
---
But you get an extra meta perk and are encouraged more to wing it and jump on a gen.
---

Hes his cousin the crappe... I mean the lauryers...
---
Post-game chat is a separate game from DBD proper, and is considered by most to be far less enjoyable.
---
well if you think this is bad you should take a look at Fdev. BHVR are coding gods compared to elite dangerous xD (i wish i was joking)
---
I prefer it.  Killer dailies are usually easier and don’t require me to play a survivor skin that so don’t have good perks on.  As a survivor main I could see your issue, but I recommend funneling BP to killers once you have your main survivors set up.
---
U
---
I must’ve been lucky to not experience it before then lol. Only time I saw it before was in KYF. I’ve felt so cheated out of gem grabs recently. All I want to do is spook people and I’m failing at it.
---
It's a very unfortunate situation that happens at low ranks. It should change as you get into higher rank. I know that's more difficult than I'm making it sound considering the death on first hook. I would consider getting a friend to queue with if it keeps happening. At least until you get into green/purple ranks.
---
Otz you are one of the nicest people I look at through my screen and you unknowingly taught me how to be a better killer. Keep being u &lt;3.
---
I agree, but the fact that this is actually a good play is just bad design. 
---
You are playing a 1v4 situation, and a single survivor has this much power in good loops.
---
The problem is that Ruin is one of two perks that slow the game down early when it's actually needed. The other is corrupt which only moves where the survivors work.
---
Make sure you wish your bro a happy birthday next week!

**Gib wipe** ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

Bruh, just thinking about it gives me ptsd
---
this is so great easily the best post i have seen so far
---
I prefer when they don't cleanse, the slowdown (thanatophobia + dying light) along with they playing like no mither users (without its benefits) fits my style.
---
Where Joey? :(
---
When I get angry people post game I turn into Elizabeth Bathory, just bathe in the toxicity. Ignore them, mock them, call out their perks, or my favorite is ask them to explain themselves so I can tell them how moronic they sound.
---
It’s not really patched, unless it broke again, but you will get banned for it.
---
F’s in the chat
---
I like Surge  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
(btw it synergizes with Surveillance)
---
It's a soft counter at most
---
😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍
---
Pop doesn't slow the game down early when that pressure is needed. It's not as hard to look after 5 gens on the map as it to pressure 7. Even if it gets cleansed in 30 seconds it's still more useful than half the perks in the game.
---
im really hoping i don’t get banned, this happened completely randomly T_T
---
It have to be active every single hit
---
Its not even the fact that devs make bad perks - everyone makes bad decisions from time to time and considering how borderline broken Reddit additions sometimes are makes me think its better they release something weaker then too OP like MoM was 
---
But what bothers me is the fact that we have PTB , we have official forums - and the devs dont listen to their community at all, what is the point of PTB then? To test their game for them? They are paid Jobs that do that kind of stuff and we do it for free because we absolutely love this game
---
I guess we should all play survivor or civilisation i guess 
---
(P.S. i sub)
---
I guess they made Overcharge this way because you can "dodge" regular skill checks and not fail but no one has mastered that at all since it's so inconsistent so I would prefer if they just go with your idea.
---
Ah yes. I will do that asap then!
---
How do you do the tombstone attack kill?  is it just the regular attacK/  like a quick one? or a different button?
---
Oh god, you have summoned the unreasonable salty people who will downvote your post for not shitting on BHVR
---
Forgot I had DS when the Billy picked me up next to hatch. Was leaning back in my chair and flung forward like a catapult only to miss it.
---
I mean spirit is 90% prediction and 10% actual experience with playing against her. Or you know spine chill is a thing that exsists and literally helps with almost all the killers in most situations such as gf or wraith. Spine chill ultimately eliminates the mind game BS what were you gonna put there dead hard?
---
Bamboozle and Clown-Phobia are pretty decent tho.
---
it can be refreshing to be toxic to toxic people, but honestly I couldn't do something like that, I have 0 confidence in an argument
---
Feng Min is number one!
---
Console or pc
---
Based on other peoples comments That’s a lot better than I thought. I thought it was 25 percent of the current progress, not a flat 25%.
---
Thoses devs are jokes man 
---
Not even releasing a x2 BP event to make excuses, they just don't care at all
---
You sound like a minion who's been attacked for being a Facebook millennial who reads exclusively boomer memes talking about someone
---
ggget fuuuucked
---
No mither. It leaves you permanilty injured. The upsides arent even that good.
---
Lithe is just a better version of it, there’s almost always a window within a 20m radius of you (not actually sure of the number, but I can always find one)
---
Killer Queen has already touched that locker’s doorknob.
---
Oh, that's so sad
---
If they could make it work, The Thing would be the most ambitious killer they've ever added. But I think it would be challenging, especially to make it work against SWF. 
---
Jack Torrance could definitely work, despite being mostly just a crazy guy with an axe. The spirits of the Overlook Hotel did help him escape the pantry, iirc. The axe also presents some ideas for perks and/or an ability based around destroying pallets. Maybe he can (on a cooldown) just instantly chop down pallets - even ones that haven't been dropped yet. Not sure how strong that would be.  The Overlook Hotel would be a neat level. 
---
No opinion on the other two.
---
No you're assuming that a low viability killer is an okay thing when the meta literally boots all killers out that aren't top tier. It's the primary reason that everyone and their mother is running Ruin right now. NO, this isn't a low rank issue. High end GOOD killers complain about gen pressure when they don't have it. Because the game is tilted in a way that makes killers HAVE to end chases and put down crazy map pressure, or they lose. This isn't just my thoughts on the matter, and the sheer fact that you're ignoring it because of YOUR thoughts on the matter, are irrelevant. 
---
Terrifying and fair are completely different. Michael terrifies me, and I love that feeling. Seeing him pop tier 3 and come barrelling down the map towards one of us fills me with a dread that I ENJOY. Because you know how that works. T3 Michael downing you is fun because you know how it works, and you had opportunities to do something about it. You can see/hear him coming, and you have conscious choices to make. 
---
A killer than can go invisible, AND silent with no ability to counter without literally guessing when to move is unfair, and unfun. Not to mention the only literal counter to BP is Iron Will, and again, guessing. But now Iron Will is useless against most spirits because, "again", Stridor exists and counters it.
---
I want to hear what your counter to BP is, because I, and a LOT of people. Still think it's unfair.
---
No you should get a stackable 150% speed boost and 3 seconds of duration for every gen you do
---
And it all activates when the last gen is completed
---
So when it activates you turn into The Flash
---
Claudette should be swapped with Ace imo
---
they are far from petty compared to the fan base
---
But you got honing stone.
---
thank you steven
---
Gotta admit, not the best comparison to make a conclusion as to why everyone runs Ruin, since Surge is just a bad perk. I think Corrupt Intervention is worth comparing to Ruin.
---
the lore is more important to me, it doesn't make me anxious
---
holy shit Leatherface is going fucking insane
---
Yep, even if you use Dying Light "as intended" (not sacrificing your obsession so you don't lose stacks), that just means you've got one player who knows that they're on rescue duty.
---
It even makes it harder to slug, since your obsession can pick people up off the ground in no time at all. Very frustrating perk to play around.
---
The worst is when you're getting chased and you know a window is trapped but vault it anyway just for that .0005% chance it might not be
---
Nah nah, lifting arms above your head workout simulator
---
it makes me really sad tbh, I love this game
---
.-. That is facts. I didn't mean anything by how I said that mate. You just asked for some reasons why and I gave some. Not sayin' anything against you personally xD
---
I know, but most people know Frank as legion. He was in the trailer and cover art. There’s no denying that Frank is the poster boy for legion.
---
that sounds. fucking incredible
---
100%
---
That would be a great addition !
---
Ehh tbh i think it would be pretty cool if he could use his portals with a survivor in hand
---
yesssssssssssss
---
90% of Feng min players I've encountered are like this
---
Doctor’s goth girl 
---
Nice name
---
I giggled myself nauseated reading this. One of the happier moments this week, imagining the chaos.
---
It’s not like killers are anymore innovative with their perks :/
---
Ruin is so strong because it immediately applies a passive effect to all survivors.
---
Pop and Dying Light require hooks and don’t effect all players, Thanataphobia requires you to injure someone to give everyone else a very minor effect, Corrupt effects less than half the generators for a temporary time.
---
I personally feel that, although Ruin is a luck-based perk as it’s a Hex, no perk currently is strong enough to apply to every player from the beginning of the game with an effect that’s actually decent enough at stalling the game.
---
Got a daily for 3 chainsaw hits as Billy. Spawn in on Haddonfield. All four survive, with me only landing two hits. FML
---
Next game though, equipped Speed Limiter and got a four kill. Landed that thing like 10 fucking times. It was a little silly.
---
Isn't this already a thing? Or am I not understanding you? There's already Emblems for evading the Killer ("how long did you loop") and killers get points in the Brutality category for destroying things and attacking survivors.
---
well the more you play the better you get the more enjoyable it becomes dont worry about salty idiots.
---
Character level is your Bloodweb level on that particular killer/survivor. This is what unlocks more perk slots and allows you to get bigger bloodwebs with more/better perks/items.  
---
Player level is just an exp rank from playing the game, no matter who you're playing and gets you irridescent shards per level that you can spend on the Shrine of Secrets for perks or on items in the store
---
Xi Jinping added as a new killer when?
---
Typical slugging camping spirit player
---
I can manage being injured all game against all the killers including Nurse
---
I won't replace any of my perks for something that's only good against one killer. I have Spine Chill already.
---
I actually like playing against Spirit. Until I get injured.
---
also, Stridor exists and many Spirits run it
---
Lithe is a conditional sprint burst that is only useful if you are not using windows efficiently, or if you've put yourself in a bad position in the first place (ran to a bad jungle gym).
---
Generally when you vault a window you want to keep going and not book it to the other side of the map.
---
That's why I think it's by far the worst of the bunch.
---
Surge great synergy with surveillance for tracking
---
you turned his skull into a fucking donut
---
Our utopia shall rise!
---
anxiety is more complicated than that
---
thank you though
---
I would like to play more often, but it's still better to stick to parts that make me incredibly happy as opposed to parts that mostly make me anxious
---
different things are important to different people
---
But the Entity also didn't FIX that
---
because killers add-ons are consumed every match no matter what, so they need to make more BP as a result
---
Don't do that... don't give me hope
---
I'm a person of simple taste I see Feng Min I upvote.
---
Survive with friends. Also I think more people are annoyed by spirit than nurse but I would still say nurse is better imo
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dm089j/bug_451622_still_nothing_is_fixed_x/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I FEEL this. Except I play on PS4 and I used to just get so many messages, from the salty ass people, even if I did amazing (or bad), I had to disable messages from Non-friends just so I could play without the anxiety.
---
Although nothing gives me more anxiety then being the last one alive and opening the exit gate while waiting to see if Spine Chill is going to light up.
---
**HEX: DEVOUR HOPE** We need to cleanse this perk otherwise we'll be full of dread.
---
their French that says it all
---
It was way into the game lol. Gotta love the 4 bnp genrush where all generators could be done in less than 30 seconds. And all of this was "balanced" by the fact that the grind was so intense they thought these offerings and add-ons would be rare enough to not be a problem.
---
BHVR barely plays their own game confirmed.
---
does that mean you’ll eventually warm up to new survivors?
---
Um Laurie should definitely be with Ash since she literally survives AND eventually kicks Michael’s ass. They should also be in the “Even though I won, was it worth the lifetime ptsd and alcoholism?” category
---
omg yeah I feel that hahaha
---
Meta-wise, Pop since using both Pop and Ruin will help you to slowdown the game and to get more time to kill survivors. And that perk will be very useful for all your killers unlike Dark Devotion that only works really well with a few killers.
---
But if you don't think you'll need Pop, go for Dark Devotion. Imo it's more fun.
---
Wikipedia is public anyone can change info
---
And killers couldn't kick gens. Survivors were able to complete all 7 gens to 99% and pop them all in seconds
---
In the right context, hustle means to "engage in prostitution."
---
In the right context, literally can mean both literally and figuratively, the opposite of what it means.
---
Does that mean we shouldnt use the main definition for beast ("an animal, especially a large or dangerous four-footed one.) because it *could* instead mean something else?
---
ruin bbq stbfl pop
---
I knew it
---
Would be neat to see him dragging a survivor through the upsidedown I agree. Maybe that could inflict with "Corrupted" stat so sometimes they just see the map as if they were in the upside down and they cant see their fellow survivors. That would be cool. Just imagining every map but in the upside down.
---
When does Season 1 Release ?
---
Because using anything that isnt meta is a death sentence for us. Not for you guys. You have actual freedom in perk choices. Wish i could run surge+surveillance but believe it or not surge is about as useless as they come and i sure as hell aint trading ruin for it
---
Thrilling Tremors *could've* been a good side-grade, but they added too many drawbacks. Pretty much every useless gen perk they add has this problem, it could be a really nice effect but they pile shitloads of downsides and drawbacks and catches on top that make it useless and a waste of a perk slot, the only actual sidegrades we have are Pop and Corrupt, and Pop is awful on low-mobility killers while Corrupt is temporary and you're left with nothing when it's gone, meaning that it's only really useful on trap killers.
---
\*chuckles* I'm in danger
---
In the game
---
They're basically husbandos at this point ☺
---
I'd be pissed too
---
Welcome to dedicated servers.
---
At least you have a level 40 clown now.
---
S-seven?
---
But they dont show on your profile or rank im talking like a mini title under your killers name like"brutal" "mastermind"
---
What a test.
---
just why, why tho j-just why.
---
Not saying it was MUCH better in the past, but requiring the meme to actually be about Dead by Daylight was such a good filter for low effort shit like this.
---
All the mods had to do was just crack down on 'smol billy' nonsense from the start and things would have been fine.
---
I mean from what I’ve heard, this is what fixing bugs us like for most devs lol
---
Finally a long post that isn't a rant. I really like it when killers and survivors play the game in this way. This post is a good example of a nice killer trying to have fun. That's why I watch HybridPanda and hate Monto. Monto's kind of a dick.
---
I hope that the plants at least show up even if they aren't interact-able, makes the place feel alive.
---
Thanks, Nea!
---
What for? missing the chainsaw or being greedy and not taking the m1
---
I just hope they've learned their lesson about tying events to updates, this wouldn't be so bad if we had the archives to play with.
---
Then survivors can’t seal them. pass.
---
thank you. i think i will go with pop :)
---
Please do more this was really cool
---
Is it possible to perform an exorcism on a Reddit comment?
---
Variable by time and location. When I play during "prime time" and I can get a game in about 2 minutes, but if I try during office hours on a weekday then I would get bored and quit before I get matched.
---
People make the mistake of comparing it to mass-appeal games, it doesn't work that way.
---
Lol true and I don’t mind for warming up with the first 1-2 games and then after that it just gets repetitive like going to the gym and doing the same workout day in and day out. Need to switch it up after awhile...
---

Anthem works doesn't it, just literally nothing to do and no rewards for what you can do right?
---
There’s no weekly skins this week as it was meant to be the Event. The next set will be released on the 31st and it’s the Myers/Laurie set, unless they push it back due to the Event delay.
---
Ruin is one of the only Killer perks that is effective at the point in a match where the Killer has zero map pressure, the start, where survivors are free to do whatever they please. No one is in a chase, no one is on a hook, all the survivors have to do is gens. Even starting a chase, the other 3 are free to do gens until that survivor is on the hook.
---
Ruin gets run because there are so few other options. Other perks require build-up making them mid-game at best, when a Killer is already (hopefully) snowballing. They're "win more" or control perks, accentuating your pressure but doing nothing at the start, again, where Killers are weakest.
---
I'm not sure I even really agree with comparing Surge and Ruin. They're both regression perks, sure, but Ruin is early-game map-pressure and Surge is mid-game control/tracking. I would've gone with comparing Ruin to Corrupt, as they are both early game slowdown perks, but I do agree all the conditions on Surge are ridiculous. At the very least the cooldown should go; it arbitrarily limits its usefulness if you get downs too fast, which is just silly. Why would you make a perk that *punishes* a killer for getting downs quickly?
---
yeah but people didn't win every single game and whined so now bhvr will never do anything actually fun again
---
polishing their content? not releasing buggy piles of shit? what game have you been playing?
---
"They are five steps from realizing that I am ten steps ahead." - Swain, and apparently BHVR
---
what's your point?  That you should pip or get a safety pip for just jumping in the hatch?  
---
You never touched a gen or a totem and you never got into a chase.
---
are we really going to pretend like it was much different than it is now? come on.
---
That's the problem with spirit I am a rank 11 survivor but my friend is a rank 1 and says spirit is in no way fun to go against or even play. Granted I have nothing against spirit personally because I know the one counter to spirit. Do as many gens as possible and once you get hooked kill yourself and make sure chases are as short as possible. It may make your rank go down but at least you are also ruining the spirit's game too.
---
Honestly, I know that all sounds toxic but its essentially the equivalent of DCing to a survivor, plus you actually get your BP as a survivor.
---
Thats a pretty good build, maybe replace Deliverance with unbreakable or iron will. My go to solo build is adrenaline, dead hard, iron will, and quick and quiet so I make less noise and can mind game killers better.
---
Its stupidly OP if used at earliest oppurtunity.
---
Looked like a normal hit to me.
---
Wow, I'm surprised you weren't downvoted into oblivion. Every time I speak out against BHVR and their problems with fixing bugs in Dead by Daylight I get downvoted.
---
No they want money lol, dont buy it if you dont want to spend money
---
I'm saying that plague and spirit were both victims before being taken by the entity, everyone else killed before the entity took them, Spirit and Plague were good up until they were taken by the entity
---
Outrage happened time before they announcrd the delay
---
Devs could announce the delay way before the event day
---
Will definitely give this a try
---
What do you mean. They can seal off the ones in walls and ground. Thats why I mentioned that the roof type could be removed.
---
It's like every other perk is the common fruit, and ruin is the warped curved sword
---
fucking hell I jumped
---
Not even once the last-gen is complete the survivor just escapes
---
It’s in the game. You’re able to use it. Then use it. Blame the game not the player (in this context)
---
Where I come from, nobody calls anyone else a beast. A strong maybe at calling someone "a beast at (blank)" but not just "beast."
---
Everyone is talking about "Oh well technically it doesn't always mean animal" when my point it is that someone who is referred to as a beast, never speaks but instead snarls and growls, and does nothing but kill *just might* not be capable of an actual relationship with even a half-functioning human like Sally.
---
I looked it up, and apparently they are, which makes no sense. Why are the DbD developers trying to ship serial killers?
---
not say I'd be in the right just saying I'd be upset about that whole turn of events
---
They are trying to make money like you said and no one is forcing you to buy anything.
---
well it actually depends on the walls as well. Some buildings you could put em on walls where survivors can’t reach them, so the same issue.
---
I appreciate that answer, you deserve an upvote.
---
I know but I love that someone put that meme in there didn't expect that 😂
---
Lol u didn’t get the joke so your mad
---
That Leatherface reminds me of Mortal Kombat X's Xenomorph with it's model swapped with Bubba's
---
So you hook and they all gang up ready to farm the hooked survivor? Their fault then. You shouldnt camp not because it is toxic but because you need to pressure the other survivors. If they cone to you, you already found what you are looking for so just keep that pressure.
---
ahh, I see
---
There's a lot of factors involved. First and foremost, the killer could be pressuring them so much that it's just not safe to attempt the unhook. Aside from that, if the post-game screen shows that the other players were the same rank as you, then chances are that it's just them being new. If they're high ranked, it's *possible* they consider you an acceptable loss. 
---
I wouldn't take it personal - their behaviour says more about them than it says about you.
---
There's a weekly thread for finding people to play with, I'd certainly encourage you to sign up. It'll get you out of the low ranks faster, and it's more fun to play with friends. Just be sure not to let it turn you into a dick. Good luck!
---
Remember me intensifies
---
I have to disagree with that first bit. I use lithe a lot and (as long as you know where multiple strong loops are) I can think of 2 very strong times to use it while looping. The 1st is to loop around a fairly strong pallet (maybe not a super safe one) then when you have to drop the pallet, if the killer tries to play around the pallet AT ALL you can just instantly vault it and get to the next loop for free. Or if he breaks it you can obviously go to the next loop and still save lithe.
---
At a jungle gym or shack or whatever I try to run it as normal, vault the window (like normal) but then instead of continuing the loop just lithe away to a good loop pretty far away. You get distance from the vault as well as the speed burst. That let's you easily get you to the next strong loop and forces the killer to either ditch you or over commit (usually not always) and sometimes the killer will try to mindgame or something and not realize you completely dipped out until it's too late.
---
Now as far as the rest of your comment, yes I think it's better than sprint burst since it can be used almost the same way if needed but can also be used mid chase.
---
I also have to agree with you the BL is often better than lithe. But I think it's very map dependent which is why in my original comment I said I was taking every map into consideration. I would say BL is better than lithe on like 60-70% of maps, and it as good or better than DH on like 20% of those, but on like 30% or so of maps BL is either completely useless or only available in a couple of places making it the worst exhaustion perk on those maps.
---
My list was first if you want to be consistent and run that perk on every single map
---
If I had been the Killer witnessing that I'd make it my personal objective to kill the sandbagger.
---
You can probably blame /u/otzdarva for making it so popular.

I personally don’t find moris toxic, but use what you want to use

lmao at this getting down voted by all the speds here on reddit. shirtless Myers was literally never funny.

Vommy mommy? Must i alert the psychiatric ward?

Why do I ship this now

**SUMMON THE MID-CHAPTER**
---
Baby Myers?;
---
The event is delayed because of the update, not vice-versa
---
yea i never saw all of the hype around it. it’s a shirtless fictional serial killer, where is the appeal to that? it’s as funny as saying nea is the entity. which isn’t funny at all
---
Left Behind could replace Dead Hard depending on how solo you really want to be.
---
Myers is still sexy
---
Mementos aren't toxic, they are just cheap. They shorten survivors experience in a match by a lot once they go down after being hooked just once.
---
Keys have a similar effect. Why bother doing gens if you can just escape at 1 or 2 gens remaining if 1 or 2 survivors died.
---
Well slow down the clip and you’ll see he clearly hit you.
---
My solo build tends to be adrenaline, iron will, dead hard/balanced landing (depending on how i'm feeling,) and empathy (for knowledge of where chases are happening to either avoid/seek out depending on what I wanna do, also helps me get healing from another injured survivor if I need it.) Though, far too often, I tend to toss on We're Gonna Live Forever instead of dead hard/balanced landing just because I'm always farming bloodpoints.
---
someone downvoted my joke :(
---
u mad bro?
---
Do people really want her nerfed?
---
I think y'all are missing the point - the power outage would've been no issue if they had some generators smh
---
This is BhVR Interactive we are talking about and it’s always amateur hour over at their studio. You would think they would perhaps have a backup system in place, but again this is BhVR Interactive who can’t dump out a patch update where the sounds from a certain said map would make your ears bleed!
---
I didn't even know they had a power outage.
---
birthday isn't religious like all the other holidays.
---
If he didn’t do that they would have gotten away because he can’t hook 3 people in 5 seconds.
---
In one game, there was two working in the same generator and the other working in another generator.
---
No one even try to come to unhook me. I struggled a lot to gain time, but it's so frustrating not being able to do anything.
---
*Look who's shitting in the tall grass*
---
I feel Like I’m constantly running the killer so dead hard or balanced is a must
---

**MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL**
---
Surge is so trash, but the idea is cool.  
---
But tbh Corrupt Intervention is great for some killers. On Pig it's godlike.
---
I think Ruin being strong is largely a part of the game design. It's all about tempo and keeping your momentum up. The same reason why BBQ is real good. Most killers just aren't fast enough to get the tempo going most games, so anything that buys time from the start is super valuable. Also it just works, while other perks usually have fancy requirements.
---
I don't feel the same, but hey, you must be very excited for the Rift! Even though I haven't cared much for lore, I love that they're tying it into gameplay now.
---
Ruin is for those killers who aren't the strongest when it comes to mind games or even when to end a chase. While surge is really good for those killers who can end chases pretty well and have the mind games.
---
Entity is weird af like that.   
---
He gives stealth killers loud ass bells and flappy flappy arm bands.
---
That wouldn't save you from D strike though.
---
I said this and someone responded with "Well sometimes shit happens" and they got upvoted. How would you both lose power, and lose your back up at the same time.
---
We almost didn't have toy story after it was deleted, but someone had a back up.
---
*Yeah, thats right, thats me baby*
---
This just makes noed op. Since the survivors won't have time to do the totems
---
i’d go with inner strength, ds, dh, spine chill. gives you enough info to know where the killer is which buys you a head start on a chase. ds for a second chance or risky play. dh to buy time in a chase for longevity. inner strength to get back in the fight soon as possible while making sure you’re completing other objectives. the issue with inner strength in solo is you can’t communicate to the team to not break the last few totems. but it’s still great early game.
---
Plague usually only needs 1 hit to down you anyway if you're sick, so why would she greatly benefit from STBFL?  Who cares about losing stacks, the stacks won't do her any good imo.
---
I, too, wish to see The Demogorgon birthed from Myers House
---
Hello fellow grammar enthusiast
---
Pop goes the Weasel is the only slow down perk I think holds up at all against ruin, and even then the answer kind of becomes "Why not both?".
---
Do you think that releasing the PTB fixes the bugs automatically or something? They release it so players can find bugs and report them so they can fix it—and there were a lot of gamebreaking bugs I can see them delaying the update for lmao
---
am I allowed to feel for that billy or are you gonna judge me some more
---
Favorite one so far
---
I am!! :)
---
Fancy pants was the best game ever
---
I keep seeing people say this but didn’t they literally *just* release a clown skin that makes his weapon invisible and a plague skin where her shoulder can bug out sporadically, both were released as buggy piles of shit lol
---
HOT HEAVY PALLETS IN YOUR AREA!
---
NO CREDIT CARD!
---
NO PICTURE!
---
NO BULLSHIT!
---
Yeah I played a few custom matches with the mentioned friend, ig that explains it
---
If I run an exhaustion perk, it's usually Balanced Landing. (Though, I frequently run Adrenaline, but I barely count that since it doesn't follow the same rules.)
---
I'd really like this. It's uncanny how many times Gens blow up just as I leave them, with no skill check warning. Other times, there is a skill check warning but I still leave without thinking and it doesn't blow up. Both feel wrong. I really like your idea though!
---
The “OH MEIN GOTT” got me good
---
But that would also screw the killer out of points.
---
If we balanced it to say, give each survivor a quarter of light bringer and some bonus BP, then it would discourage killers from using it, but leave the option there so survivors cant hide for 30 minutes.
---
Moris are fun but their fun is maximized when they're used at the late game after a climactic chase.
---
The final kill move is cool in concept, but it's better when there's a huge buildup to it, and not when you are the first one kicked out of the game in two minutes because of bad luck at the beginning
---
he could've been kicked by the game
---
Before they patched it you could do all gens even after you completed the 5 necessary there was nothing stopping you from doing a generator even if the exit gates we're opened because those didn't turn on.
---
Perks like BBQ and offerings like bloody party streamers are addiditve. So if you earn 20k bloodpoints in a game, with bbq and a bps, then at the end of the trial it takes the 20 you earned, adds 20 for bbq, then another 20 for bps. 60 k total.
---
 So you wont earn 20k, get another 20k, and then a 40 k for a total of 80k bloodpoints.
---
Perks like Thrill of the Hunt or distressing work diffently than bbq. They earn you points inside a match, so you get caped at 8k bloodpoints per category. Basically meaning Thrill and distressing are almost useless compared to bbq.
---
I cant find ruin anywhere
---
"follow the killer"
---
Yeah, looks like it's over here somewhere, ohhh I have it
---
Great, furry Michael
---
ThE GaMe WAs EvEN WoRSe BeFOrE StoP ComPlAIning
---
Just restart the game before switching over to online play and you shouldn't have the issue anymore. A support ticket should get you most of your BPs back but won't adjust your rank changes at all if any.
---
&gt;This just makes noed op. Since the survivors won't have time to do the totems
---
They could just change NOED to work similar to Rancor. Only finishing all generators activates NOED. There, fixed.
---
Jesus fuck man that sounds atrocious
---
I think it's kind of intimidating.  Like, you dropped the pallet and saved some time, but he ain't ever stopping
---
One of the biggest problem with ruin is that because ruin is so prevalent, I actually became good at hitting greater skill checks. This means that when ruin isn't there I still hit them and get a bonus out of it. 
---
Killers literally trained me to punish them for not running ruin. 
---
Depending on how funky the skill check fps is in a specific game, I hit between 7/10 to 10/10 greater skill checks. If skillchecks were always smooth and not jaggy for no reason it would almost always be 10/10. That's a lot of extra progress on a gen.
---
One obvious thing I notice after every rank reset is how many people waste minutes looking for ruin instead of powering through it.
---
True, that's another reason people do it, but enough killers have run into the toxic version that they just assume the person is intending to be a douche lol. You can usually tell the difference if the flashlight clicker is teabagging at the same time.
---
DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES
---
Death... is not an escape.
---
Disconnecting is though
---
I like this more than my reply.
---
Don't forget you could place a trap under a hooked survivor which would instantly trap them upon unhook.
---
Make sure to press save after you edit. My flair is custom so if thats not it its still possible.
---
Second Wind without needing to be hooked. No
---
Good point, didn't see that.
---
Still, no harm done - good advice for him.

Steve:  **AHOY LADIES**, didn't see you there.  Would you guys like to set sail on this ocean of flavor with me?

Clown:  (frantically securing blond wig to his head and speaking in a forced high pitch) Yessiree, skipper!
---
I was thinking the same exact thing. We’ve had similar  issues but none of our progress was lost due to constant back ups, back ups for our back ups, and just some common sense. Does BHVR hire anyone to work there??
---
I cant bring myself to remove thrill of the hunt it's the only thing that guarantees ruin is worth it
---
They are to us all, he's got a great laugh
---
"Aw shit, here we go again"
---
**U W U WHAT MIGHT THIS BE**
---
From a solo survivor's perspective, Ruin has a huge impact on how a game goes, more so than any other perk. If it's not found early on and the randoms decide that they will not be doing gens while Ruin is up, this perk essentially wins the game for the killer. On the other hand, if it's found super early, it's a wasted perk slot for the killer.
---
In my opinion it shouldn't be a Hex perk. It can be very strong or completely useless, all depending on the spawn (and the communication between survivors), it's a roulette. I wish it worked like Corrupt Intervention and was only active for a certain time in the beginning.
---
Lots of survivors can be salty while other times it can be the opposite. If On Xbox you can report them if they send you a rude or insulting message (there is literally a report option for this, so no one can tell me off for telling OP to use it because YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO USE IT) after that you should block them.
---
Doing generators is already a snoozefest. Making the timers longer isn't going to make Survivors any more interesting. An extra objective required to escape would work more effectively. A new objective, or a hex perk that messes with the exit gates until cleansed, and takes priority over other hex perks so NOED doesn't block it if there is only 1 totem.(of course, if EGC begins it would cancel so it doesn't make escaping as the last survivor even more impossible)
---
fr everyones pissed but like its not their fault they need to redo all the progress they did ALL over again
---
I’m fine with it but they should change it. Change it where you have to hook the person twice if burning a ivory or Eboni Mori. I mostly play survivor but if I have a daily I’m playing killer and will burn one once In awhile and I always hook the person twice before stealing their soul. 
---
Fun fact: A memento mori (Latin 'remember that you must die' is an artistic or symbolic reminder of the inevitability of death. “The expression 'memento mori' developed with the growth of Christianity, which emphasized Heaven, Hell, and salvation of the soul in the afterlife. 
---
See you in the fog.
---
Yes pop.
---
Seems like a good one for people who wanna focus on generator disruption.
---
I like the idea that he is almost like a grandpa, and he is so vanilla it hurts.   
---
Like the legion would make fun of him for drinking his tea because he doesn't take chai, since it "Hurts his mouth"   
---
Then they see what is on his camera and never bring it up again.

No human who is THAT much of a "wuss" could do that sort of thing to people

NOVEMBER HALLOWEEN EVENT
---
Once every 3 games or so a survivor will teleport 5-10 feet, which often makes me look like an asshole.
---
If you have trouble finding ruin, run Detectives Hunch or learn totem spots.
---
don't get me wrong, shelter woods is pretty rough for bl, but the main tree and basement stairs are always viable uses if you have access. dont forget that
---
Exactly! If the first gens take a bit longer to get completed, Pop goes the Weasel is much easier to use and once applied, is a lot more crippling. Regressing 25% of a gen with Ruin still up is devastating to survivor's efficiency. These two perks together can be downright filthy.
---
I can appreciate this outcome - and yeah, it is good advice.
---
[WHY ARE PEOPLE SO RUDE, IT'S JUST A GAME THERES NO REASON TO THREATEN OR ACT LIKE A CHILD WHEN YOU ARE OUTPERFORMED. BHVR SHOULD CRACK DOWN HARDCORE ON ABUSE IN POST GAME CHAT. I CONCEDE I WAS A BIT RUDE BUT ALL IN JEST](https://i.redd.it/88tbwjikl5t31.jpg)
---
“There’s no perks that help looping” is where you lose me lol, you’re just trolling at this point.
---
Yes, because i felt some survivors tried to draw me away from the Hook in an obvious way instead of going for gens \^\^ But i will patrol instead next time
---
You can pip but only Mori 2 of them and hook the other 2, I learned quick with Myers that you don’t pip if you Mori them all...
---
~~Jesus~~ Jeff that was a good burn

FISHING PLANET HAS ITS OWN HALLOWEEN EVENT AND DBD DOESNT
---
I don't have trouble at all. I'm a nancy pants totem warrior. what you said doesn't prove me wrong at all. 
---
totem spawns are becoming unbalanced with very, very little middle ground, and if we're at the point where a perk is required to find it, then there is an issue
---
&gt;Why would you make a perk that punishes a killer for getting downs quickly?
---
DS would like a word.
---
My pip build is bt, we'll make it, sc, and dh.
---
Out of 65 perks, 30 of them are so bad I wouldn’t ask anybody to use them even in an entire build for them, 5 of them are perks for their own niche that don’t really affect the match for anyone but yourself(Plunderer’s, AITH, Left Behind, WGLF, No Mither), 12 are okay but underpowered, there are 13 that are good enough to be ran most games, and the rest are just okay in builds made for them. Yes I count them and organize my thoughts on the meta every time new perks are added, not numbers that I pulled from my bum lol. 
---
I’m not saying the survivor side has it any better or worse than the killer, I’m saying both sides massively suffer from perk diversity issues out of their control. At the very least, killer can make use of their powers occasionally for a little more synergy, whereas often new perks or specifically new healing perks restrict survivors from using items to actually use them. Not to mention most survivor items and add-ons are kinda trash which is why you see the same 5 variations of survivor players with one odd-ball every so often who probably didn’t get their cute build to work, or probably died for it. Just food for thought, I hope us players can come together to discuss healthy changes for all sooner rather than later- it’s so good and healthy for everyone to have fun.
---
Killing survivors after 0 effort, yh people seem to love that
---
Oh i was thinking of like you place them at your own height. So you cant go any higher than the given prompt.
---
Why is it so loud in here?
---
I've seen people disconnected for no reason entire day today. It's not one hour
---
One tells only truth. The other, only lies.
---
Didnt think of that. Sounds pretty bad for survivors.
---
It’s permanently in my build all the time with Myers, it’s so good...
---
If all four survivors just hide and wait, CI is useless...
---
What about headless chainsaw Myers?
---
I won’t use it until my second unhook so the killer thinks he’s safe to tunnel me, I’ve won a lot of games by getting unhooked and tunneled by the exit
---
The willful ignorance it takes to just act like survivors are God's gift and have never done anything wrong ever is astounding. When killer mains arent allowed to have a strong killer like spirit and nurse because it's not easy enough for survivors to bully the killers so hard that they DC. And then yall wonder why you never get to play against any other killer than nurse, spirit and billy in high ranks.
---
If a majority of people who read your comment gave ya downvotes I would suggest running back to it and editing in “/s” at the end of it, mate.
---
Also I prefer 2 tokens in STBFL and everyone on my bear traps... considering that actually happened recently, felt odd but satisfactory to see my bear traps work.
---
Exhaustion used to go down even when a survivor was running. Sprint burst was the meta then because it would proc mid-chase. Double pallets at pretty much every single loop. No bloodlust. Pallet and window vault vacuums. Self care used to heal you so fast that you could literally heal in front of the killer in a chase at a pallet and they couldn't do anything about it. And so much more lol
---
RAGE RAGE FUCKING RAAAAAGE. WHY CAN'T NO ONE DO A FUCKING GEN? STOP BEING SO OVER ALTRUISTIC AND TRYING TO UNHOOK WHEN THE KILLER HAS BARELY LEFT THE AREA. AND KILLERS WHO TUNNEL AND CAMP EARLY GAME CAN SUUUUUCK MY DIIIIIICK
---
How can an image be “wrong” because it hasn’t happened to you.
---
Does Dead by Daylight's engine run on frames?
---
I know skyrim did, so if you unlocked the frame count then everything would start freaking out. If you were running on 120 franes (I know it sounds ridiculous but its skyrim) everything would accelerate twice as fast than if the frqme count was maxed at 60 fps.
---
Follow up question, if DBD does run on frames, did they just double charging times on counsel, since consel is maxed at 30 fps, so that the game would be consistent with pc?
---
I’d much rather them use up their ds early on than when they have the exits 99’d and three buddies to body block for them
---
It's because a large portion of this sub are both low rank players and console players.
---
Before I deployed I was around rank 10-12 on PC. Within a week I was rank 1 as both survivor &amp; killer on console. I spent 5 months as rank 1. When I got off of deployment, not only could I barely hit a skillcheck (since you get used to shit-tier FPS on the console), but players were leagues ahead in terms of skill. Survivors weren't absolute potatoes who fell for every simple moonwalk, and killers were an entirely different breed. Survivors were able to juice every last drop out of a loop, since their movement was more efficient. Killers were able to mindgame more efficiently since they had better control over their camera.
---
It's such a drastic difference and I always laugh when this argument comes up. It always gets downvoted and I bet the Withering Event that the people downvoting have NO experience at red ranks on both systems.
---
you went completely off topic here, my point was that they do in fact release buggy piles of shit. it's almost a rule at this point that when a major update comes out something is going to break. I don't have any doubts about them caring about the game, clearly they do.
---
If you stun legion with the pallet, it will take them out of frenzy with a shorter cooldown that if they manually end it
---
Just me and the boys
---
I want.....to eat them
---
I saw update, got excited.
---
Then I read the rest of the post.
---
downvotes are for calling out the salty survivors buddy. Plus who cares about votes lmao
---
ive had dreams were im in dbd games, like as a survivor. its really weird but pretty cool
---
They're all so intense and then the Clown is just 'eh'
---
Wait double pallets? Like one on either side?
---
yes but you’re acting like crybabies its literally just an event thats been postponed for a week max and you’re all crying “iTs noT gONNA be hEre bY HAllOwEeN” when they have 8 days to get their shit for us. They postpone an update cause it was bugged, power blows, they postpone it even more, say they release it for and its filled with unplayable bugs like nurses new addons making her stutter. What will yall do? Scream at the devs for updating the game with bugs. The community NEVER gives the devs a break even after they try their best and thats my whole argument just shut up until they fix it.

Perks for killer depend on what killer you’re playing. I’m currently rank 2, and with nurse/spirit/billy I can 4K with no perks. The only killer where I’ve felt like I NEED noed or ruin is pig, but that’s most likely because she’s my least played, besides leatherface who I don’t even own.
---
I’ve been playing Unbreakable, Adrenaline, Botany knowledge, and Bond along with a brown medkit with yellow addons
---
that's usually what happens when you have disorganized, undocumented spaghetti code
---
No one wants any mori the state that they are in.  Plus I have 5.7k karma so a lot of people agree/like me, thanks for the ego boost
---
WHY DOESN'T THIS GAME SUPPORT ULTRAWIDE MONITORS YET "It gIVeS unFAIr aDVANtage!!!!" JUST FUCKING CROP THE SCREEN SO I DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE MONITOR RESOLUTION EVERY TIME I WANT TO PLAY
---
Not my fault. I was doing gens. You?

ARE YOU HAPPY FOR FISHING PLANET OR ANGRY FOR DBD? BECAUSE IF IT’S HAPPINESS THIS IS NOT THE FUCKING PLACE TO SHOW IT
---
When is the 3.0.0 chapter?
---
Don’t see him sipping tea tbh.
---
It's main use for me has been grab achievements like the nurse one or the one added with ghostface
---
Moris are fine, tbh I like getting mori'd bc it's cooler than a hook. But it does take the fun away because it can end games too early, would be better if one could use them after 2 hooks instead
---
GODDAMMIT!!! YOU ALREADY CURB-STOMPED ME IN THE GAME!!!! I DON'T NEED A GODDAMN "REASON YOU SUCK" SPEECH IN THE CHAT!!! DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO THAN FUCKING HARASS PEOPLE AFTER YOU'VE ALREADY HUMILIATED THEM!???!!?!

---
IM BOTH. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT FISHES CAN BE HALLOWEEN AND THAT KILLERS CAN BE NOVEMBER HALLOWEEN BECAUSE OF UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES
---
It's because survivor is a largely skill-less role. 
---
Both sides have to know maps well to run loops.
---
Both sides have to know *HOW* to run loops.
---
Survivors have to land great skillchecks.
---
Survivors have to adapt to one killer with 2 addons and 4 perks. 
---
Boom. I've listed everything that survivors need to know. On top of that, learning to land great skillchecks isn't really a challenge. And two of the things I listed are skills *both sides* need to have. 
---
Killers, along side knowing maps and loops, must adapt to 16 perks, know their killer and their addons, and somehow manage to force 4 survivors to stop what they're doing while only being able to actively pressure one at a time.
---
No if he has a certain add on, and they are in tier 2 any broken pallets will appear already thrown not up. Freddy is who you can throw down fake pallets with.
---
Ah.... Sorta get it but I'm ok with that, just a bit confused on why here, you can do whatever you want 😊
---
Dbd gone gay would like to know your location

Now you're just being kinky.
---
Oh I can totally relate about the interest in the lore! I enjoy playing the game and I want to do well, but I also really like the characters. I know I might be in the minority, especially considering how rn the game's lore is just a few paragraphs of a bio per character. But I'm super excited about the Archives and can't wait to learn more about my problematic faves. If you want to be a DBD fan without the stress that comes with tryhard matches, maybe you could team up with some friends and take it easy. Worst case scenario, I find that watching streamers is a nice, stress-free way to enjoy the game.
---
Gitgud is not a proper response to a gripe with a broken character
---
All I see is megs and David king dying every time I play online. They crouch behind a tree for the entire match or as soon as they hear a heart beat. Then the match becomes 2v1 because the other want lift off their crouch button.
---
Bubba buff looks good

WHY DID YOU CANCEL HALLOWEEN DAMNIT HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN TO MY 2 YEAR OLD THAT WE CAN'T GO TRICK OR TREATING THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF "UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES?"
---
Yes, that's exactly what happened. So they decided to delay the event until the update. It wasn't going to be launched at the same time until the delay.
---
AM NEW TO DBD. MY THIRD EVER KILLER GAME.  USED LEGION.  FAILED TO KILL ANYONE.  IN CHAT.  LOLNOOB GGEZ.  
---
WHY YES I AM NEW.  YOU CAN TELL THAT FROM THE FACT I AM USING ONE PERK.  YOU ALL APPEAR TO BE LVL 50.  
---
ALSO I HATE RANK RESET.  I JUST HAVE TO STOP PLAYING FOR A WEEK SO I DON'T FACE NOTHING BUT KILLERS WITH NOED, HEX:RUIN, AND BBQ &amp; CHILLI.  
---
BUT THE BIT THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF IS WHEN WE HAD TWO PEOPLE DC IN ONE MATCH AND I THOUGHT "THAT'S NOT COOL IMMA KEEP PLAYING" BUT THE KILLER KICKED THE HATCH SHUT IN MY FACE AND I WAS LIKE "THAT WASN'T VERY CASH MONEY OF YOU".
---
and that’s why i play huntress because it show’s how i actually feel without having to do anything.
---
&gt;But then how do you counter it
---
Counter what?
---
i wasnt talking about gameplay, i was pointing his attitude. calling someone thrash or boosted just because they use decisive is not a wholesome thing to say, right?
---
"But if people can hear her phasing in TR, she will just be bad again." No. Just make it a consistent volume at certain ranges. She can still stand still while phasing to confuse survivors.
---
Example: You are spirit (with the change) at a T&amp;L Wall Jungle Gym's window, facing a survivor with spine chill. You phase, turn around (turning off their spine chill, making them think you are going around. They vault, and you unphase, turn around and hit them.
---
Congratulations, she can now use actual mindgames.
---
Eh, the other night I only snagged one, right at the gate. Her teammates tried healing her as I scooped her up, then all three of them just bailed. 
---
I felt bad for her and I'd played such a shitty ass game anyway, I just dropped her and let her go.
---
If it was on pornhub maybe.
---
Dedicated servers? Is that pc only? Pretty sure console is still p2p, and gen grabs are still wonky anyways. I have like 40ms and will do the animation for grabbing someone of the gen and mid animation all of a sudden I’m cleaning on my knife and they’re running away 10 feet away from me
---
&gt; EGC starts by itself but without powering the gates

Because fuck survivors, amright?
---
Exactly.

Unless it’s Rob Zombie’s Halloween 2. Then him screaming ‘Die!’ is clearly absolutely essential.

NOED. You said finishing all generators activates NOED, but that’s already what it does. So I’m assuming you mean it’s not applied to a totem?
---
Edit: never mind I see what you mean. If the killer were to start endgame early then it wouldn’t work.
---
fml
---
What are you talking about? Every video ive watched of his involving Decisive is him saying hes just gonna power through it.

WAIT WHAT? I'M USING AN ULTRAWIDE MONITOR AND NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING! WHAT AM I MISSING SIR?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvVABjafCp0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvVABjafCp0)
---
Yeah, I don't get why surge has a long cooldown when Pop doesn't, seeing as Pop is just a much better perk.
---
I don’t think that helps the killer at all. They’re way more likely to escape at that point. I’d rather have them go full immersion on me, giving me the opportunity to flush them out than roll the dice on whether or not I get lucky with exit door placement.
---
So it promotes SWF
---
Totems, duh
---
Damn dude pretty good chase! Good on your for mjndgaming her a bunch
---
I misunderstood what he was saying
---
&gt; NOED. You said finishing all generators activates NOED, but that’s already what it does. So I’m assuming you mean it’s not applied to a totem?
---
&gt; 
---
Currently powering the exit gates activates NOED, not finishing all generators (like Rancor).
---
aaAA me too!! I love that they're adding the archives, I might play just to unlock them
---
usually I play sfw with my brother, though often he doesn't wanna play for the same reasons I do. I should try and convince my friends to get into the game. also, I watch n0ob3, I like his videos
---
To be continued

It's a different way to pronounce arse.

What does Cameraderie do again?
---
It’s not you that worries me, mate
---
**its the people that do this that worries me**
---
You can’t stop them either, they different bois!
---
I have been running Freddy with no ruin (using corrupt instead) and out of the past 10 or so games I have only had 2 people escape. All those matches were at rank 1.
---
I highly advise to stop using ruin, and use something more consistent. You may do bad at first but I think it will up your game overall and make you less reliant on RNG. 
---
I run corrupt, discordance and pop and it does wonders to slow the game down.
---
Stupid Bubba
---
so this is the boys bathroom 
---
may i see the girls bathroom now?

BILLY OP PLS NERF
---
BOYS NIGHT OUT!
---
Nah jk
---
Nea is a girl. This is the boys night out.
---
Surge is actually 14.4 seconds of regression not ~7. (It makes the Generator explode, which is a base of 10% regression, and then adds 8% regression on top of that. 18% of 80 is 14.4 if you're wondering about the math.) This means that it's only 7% less regression than Pop Goes The Weasel, and Surge doesn't require you to waste 2 seconds kicking a Generator to apply it, and Surge has the potential (on maps that aren't Mother's Dwelling because that map is fucking massive) to explode and regress multiple Generators at once. Even just hitting 2 Gens with Surge can be 36% regression, which isn't anything to brush off.
---
All of that said, Ruin is still a better perk. ...Assume it stays up and active for longer than 5 seconds.
---
*fabric tearing on glass shards noises*
---
There are 4 more ranks aside from rank 1. Why would BHVR balance the game around red ranks only? That's as insane as trying to balance it off of gray ranks. Ruin was fine how it was. I don't understand why they buffed it.
---
Nah where is NEA
---
Nice!!! So well played
---
Just put on whispers and think of better ideas
---
We must not mention that thing.Delete your comment.
---
Yeah, I'd be downed in one hit anyway, so take that!
---
I get what you mean though.
---
30minutes! damn you really suck at finding them
---
I think...?
---
YES PLEASE CONTINUE TO TEABAG AND SHJT TALK WHEN IM DOING DAILIES ON MY LEVEL ONE KILLER. BUT ALSO PLEASE CONTINUE DCING WHEN I YOINK YOU OFF THE EXIT GATE BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO WIN.
---
REMEMBER TO WEAR PROTECTION.
---
This happens to many times to me so I feel you're pain
---
uhm okay
---
Corrupt is good on killers that like to multi-target and juggle like Legion, Plague, and Ghostface because it enforces stacking on gens.  I actually dislike Corrupt on Hag, because it just prompts survivors to run towards me and clear out my sigils before I can actually construct a complete sigil web. Depending on the totem spawn, Trapper can even get a free TOTH on Ruin, and Hag can try it if the survivors are potatoes.
---
Legend has it, if you say ‘Halloween Remake’ three times in a mirror, Rob Zombie appears and beats you over the head with a porn magazine.
---
Yeah I usually use it when my teammate is looping near a locker to buy them some time. Very rarely do I get saves
---
I'd support that.  Ebonies are thoroughly busted.  Ivory isn't fun still a little crutch but manageable since it can only kill 1.

---
Hard Liquor?
---
My guess is they will eventually bring perks down that have little to no requirements. I hope they do so on both sides, that is (like they did with DS and MoM).
---
Or they just bang out more centralized generators.
---
Can you do one with the rest of the killers? And then maybe even all of them?
---
Not so it’s a bug that requires the killer que in as a survivor in the lobby hence why there is a survivor spot missing but the only way for this work is to have an invite from a friend (survivor) and glitch the game and join the group as killer. Also the devs automatically ban for this after the game ends I believe
---
nah I’m more mad at how long the motion tracking took
---
I AM LAUGHING MY ASS OFF BUT I SHOULDNT SAY IT BECAUSE THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ANGRY POST!

I've been making a fan made chapter and all the content of the chapter was deleted like it says in the post if you check back on my profile you should see the teasers I made.
---
Only killer it really shines on is plague. Your obsession can’t heal everyone if no one wants to cleanse themselves. I’ve had some decent success with legion as well I typically deep wound the obsession and track the rest from there making the obsession spend time mending themself. Still not as effective as using plague though.
---
I’m not acting like a crybaby. I’m disputing your claim that it’s not preventable. That’s a ridiculous and false statement. I don’t gaf about the update in particular. But it is bad form that they can’t keep up with an annual release or don’t maintain good backups and people who talk like they know development but don’t (I do, it’s my life) and people who close their eyes and ears because BHVR makes their favorite game are frustrating as fuck to listen to. Especially when they immediately resort to calling you “entitled” or “a crybaby” for saying that not maintaining back ups is ridiculous. It’s ridiculous.
---
Sounds dumb
---
All the pictures are of his wife
---
Yet there's many other games that come out relatively bug free and fix them in the first go around.
---
Please stop being apologetic towards incompetence.
---
What the heck lol you definitely should’ve wiggled free
---
Where did it say they lost everything?
---
If you add 12.5% to 25% extra time to generators, all you should need is a nerf to ruin because after that I think slowdown perks start to become a bit too powerful
---
Who?
---
I dunno, I have been with a Rank 20 Claudette today, and a Myers, who after two kills let me and Claudette play the game complete to survive, she kept running everytime he was there, even when he was obviously was not doing any harm, after 2 gens are done she just T-Bagged at the Exit Gate without a break.
---
I believe you because I always see people say different numbers about this and I think it’s actually way too RNG to make an average... sometimes survivors will just ignore ruin because they don’t have any skillchecks to do, and some other times their games are stalled because they get too much and can’t hit them right.
---
As someone who just destroyed a group of over altruistic survs as freddy, I support this

She still hears you man.  Regardless she just follows the sound.  You can't lose her with anything you put forward.  All you've described is maybe extending the chase by a single phase cooldown against the more mediocre ones.  Their cooldown comes back in next to no time they'll do it again and you are on borrowed time no pun intended.  This isn't anything that's going to reliably work or keep you up against a decent-good Spirit.  Their headset works as a homing missile.  I'm not even a good Spirit but even I will never end phase further than 2 steps behind you.  Your ass is mine after that second step.  If I get bullied or bm'd hard playing a weak killer I just switch to Spirit for a quick confidence booster, collect my 4K and continue my session.  She is mindlessly easy to do well with as long as you got 2 ears and a headset and aren't up against a lobby of Iron Wills.
---
Not to mention it's a godsend against Prayer Beads Spirit.
---
shit i didn't even realize otz was the one posting this lol
---
Pig is Amanda Young and therefore not in the bois poster, we can only hope the artists does a female version.
---
I feel like this is a response directly from BHVR.  Lol
---
If a killer can't find survivors, start a chase, or get a down in 120 seconds with 'No' gen progress the fault isn't on the perk.
---
Killer has had two minutes to find someone and down them. If they can’t even find someone in that time, I don’t think it’s a perk problem.
---
Also, good survivors will just go do an open gen.
---
Or they should just work after two hooks. The ability to end someone’s game in two seconds is moronic.
---
I think the fix for Ruin should be that the first 3 skill checks on every generator for each survivor are hexed and then become normal skill checks after that, as long as they don’t stop working on the generator. Anytime a survivor stops working on the gen (i.e. from being chased away, or switching from using a toolbox, or going to unhook, etc,) the hex reactivates for that survivor, starting the 3 hexed skill checks over again. I feel like this way, it doesn’t punish low ranks too much, and high ranks who are good at getting great skill checks anyway are mostly unfazed. It would bring the two group together while still being a negative burden and would force people to consider how long they should keep working on a generator.
---
what is the buff to Detectives hunch? I haven't really seen much in the upcoming changes
---
You should put the artists name in the title, a lot of people are thinking YOU are responsible for the art work and you’re not correcting them lol
---
Yeah and I repeat: if all 4 survivors HIDE (meaning somewhere the killer won’t look and so won’t down or even injure anyone at all) CI is useless.
---
If you did not cause the glitch, then you should not be banned. It can be caused by at least 2 people, and one has to be killer.
---
Truly the best streamer.  He plays to have fun, but teaches as well, and never gets toxic.  We don't deserve Otz.
---
Maybe its to prepare the servers for an increase influx of people playing. At least that's what I think the main problem that happens when there is a special event or new chapter release.
---
If the trial starts and we all 4 go to the corner of the map far from everything how is the killer supposed to find us? lol
---
Someone's going to die
---
And then you tell them how good they have it with this legion
---
I've never seen likes go up and down so fast. This may be the most controversial thing I've ever posted.
---
Give us the event or give us death
---
I’ll be sure to copy kanji next time(or other language), also I’d correct them if I wasn’t at work.
---
One thing you'll find is that even when you know multiple survivors are circling the hook like sharks, they absolutely believe you should step back and let them get free unhooks at no risk. Even if there are no more gens to patrol, even if the gates are open and it's obvious they're coming back for unhook, they really truly believe you shouldn't be within sight of it or else it's bad sportsmanship. Don't let it get to you, you're not being an asshole, you're making the only move that isn't shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Early/mid game it's to your detriment, but if there are 2 people waiting to swoop in on a hook that means you are stalling 3 people. At least 2 out of 4 should have been doing gens to pressure you away. And when the gates are open there's literally no reason to chase unless you have some method of insta-downing (which a lot of people don't like for obvious reasons).
---
But none of that really matters since it sounds like a low rank game. Anything goes, people will do weird things. They just got salty.
---
now this is what I like
---
shirtless myers is not funny anymore tbh
---
You went completely off-topic, too. I never said their content isn’t, as you put is, a “buggy pile of shit”. I said that they at least have the decency to try to fix as many bugs as possible instead of rushing it and pumping out more bugs. Also, Canadians are still awesome.
---
They shouldn't have touched his chest!
---
This have to be the only thing that surv and killer mains agree
---
OP: camps and slugs with leatherface
---
*doesn't pip*
---
OP: how could this happen
---
And also to see how keen they are to respond instantly lmao
---
I personally dont believe it either but you supposably get banned if you disconnect too much. I dont see what more they are supposed to do especially given how glitchy this game is
---
The iridescent axe head. It makes hatchets insta-down people, but it limits you to one hatchet at a time. However, there’s addons that increase carrying capacity, nullifying the original downside.
---
Since sarcasm is hard for me on the internet, lemme ask, are you asking an actual question, or is this a joke?
---
yea never said i'd dc either i was literally just saying id be upset about missing that like geez i can't say anything on this sub anymore without somebody harshing my vibe
---
Why does he look like the mad doctor from Anal Assylum

Iridescent head, I doesn't make them DC. It is a one shot hatchet, that, then people DC due to the incredible amounts of salt they have requires medical attention, and a ER visit... Just a guess

Add a military belt and ivory mori for love letters after a match

She would be my favorite Survivor if she had decent clothes. All of her stuff is either "gamer gear", hand me downs from her grandma, or hand me downs from Nea.
---
Same problem with Meg. If it's not something to do with sports, it's not Meg :/
---
"buggy piles of shit" is a direct quote from your first post, nice try though.
---
Nah, nobody's gonna go out of their way to cleanse all totems unless they're a SWF or they run Inner Strength. It's one of the reasons why a lot of survivors want a totem counter(as in numbers, not a counterplay tool) so randos can actually know when they're wasting their time looking for totems.
---
Gens do take a while to do against quality killers that play aggressively and play primarily to pressure said gens.  You absolutely cannot rely on escaping as a 3v1 while a teamate spends the game Self Caring it away.  A good Spirit or Freddy or something of the like will absolutely destroy you if all 4 survivors don't pull their weight throughout the game.
---
We both know most Self Care Gamers don't have the balls to heal just anywhere.  Many of them will insist on going to the corner of the map or into the main building or wherever they feel safest to start their heal.  Any amount of time spent doing so needs to be factored and added to their heal time.
---
What if the killer finds you first?  Oh God no anything but having to run a killer injured....LEARN TO LOOP LOL!  Being injured isn't the end of the world it's a nuisance.  If you know how to loop it isn't that big of a deal being injured.  This is the mindset of every Self Care Gamer because they're typically dogshit in chases and require full health so they can last 15 seconds in chase as opposed to 5 seconds....You guys murder teamates flat out.  You can't throw away that amount of time against a good killer playing to pressure gens you just can't.  He'll pick your team off one by one while the final gens don't get to pop since you're a non equation.  Multiply this issue by the amount of Self Cares in your lobby.
---
You don't need to pop the gen yourself to see the auras, and they increased its range :D
---
Well then I'd defs just keep sinking points into her if you really want it, though Self-Care just takes forever. Do you have David leveled up? Honestly recommend on doing him first to get We're Gonna Live Forever, then you can start grinding out BP more efficiently with that.

---
*laughs in ghost face following the blendette around*
---
*the slowest Tbag in the west*
---
That makes it easier to find them though. Even if survivors wait it out to do gens, that gives the killer more time to find them. I'm surprised it isnt used more. It slows the game down more than ruin does against survivors who cant hit hex skill checks and waste time looking for the totems or the ones who can hit them and power through ruin. Ruin is only good on ranks 10-20 assuming the totem isnt found right away.
---
Oh I don't even walk, I tend to watch them from around corners in the true spirit of Michael Myers. Then when they start running or go ups tier, *heeeeere I coooome*. 
---
Honestly, I think I enjoy toying with them more than actually winning.
---
Oh
---
Frick, I just bought the Plague for 9000 shards;(
---
It’s free but bugged right now and you can’t access it.
---
Killers having hook vacuums is fine and it isn't remotely the same as pallet vacuums, which teleported survivors to safety on the opposite side of a pallet. 
---
The space to hook a survivor isn't literally directly and only in front of a hook; there is a radius for the prompt, and it is necessary. But the actual animation takes place directly in front of a hook, so the killer gets pulled in for the animation which makes it look like a survivor who was really close to wiggling out should have gotten it, even though they didn't.
---
But what OP posted is not right. Something bugged out
---
It's alright mate. You make it when it's ready.
---
I don't know that that's true but in the event that it is I apologize for being mistaken
---
Oh, did I say that? Sorry, I completely forgot.

Typical fanboy response. How about I play other games and demand the that DBD, a game that paid for, get its shit together?
---
I swear the video game industry is the only industry where a large part of its consumer base laps up anti-consumer practices and general incompetence and attacks anyone else who dares demand better.
---
You know what else is a hard job? Being a doctor or nurse. But they get way less leeway to fuck up and rightfully so. So many don't for the most part. Don't be afraid to expect and demand better. Especially when it's possible.
---
I feel high rank survivors never say GG unless they escape the trial
---
Moris definitely need a change. As most others have stated, making them available after 2 hooks instead of 1 would be ideal
---
DUDE!!
---
Yes it was. 
---
The 3.3.0 patch would've started the Withering Blight event. Big patches ALWAYS come out exactly 2 weeks after their PTBs begin. However, the patch wasn't ready.
---
The reasoning for the poorly-worded tweet was that no official release date was announced for the patch (you can't delay something if you never gave a timeframe for the release), but they did say the event would start on the 22nd.
---
This is why I use Haunted, 2/3 chance they’ll expose their team which should hopefully let me snow ball

---
Why delegate a BP boost to one perk rather than a general boost to BP gain for killers? I know some other perks give smaller boosts, like thrill of the hunt, but even then, those seem small in comparison.
---
What kind of matches do you have that the killer’s demand 4ks? They sound like pansies! I’ve Never ran into those guys!
---
Now this is a good answer. 
---
I think it’s counter productive to use CI and Hexes at the same time because with CI you push survs away from gens and actually  them the idea to look for secondary objectives.
---
Didn’t think about whispers and you’re right, that’s a scenario where if you can’t find anyone it’s on you, but how many killers really do have two perk slots available for Whispers and CI? I’m looking especially at Whispers here, since in the higher ranks finding them is not the problem.
---
Users on this sub being entitled children? you dont say!
---
Same.
---
IF ADRENALINE ISNT TOXIC NEITHER IS NOED
---
If it was a speed boost after every gen, but no heal, I'd say it's a great compromise.
---
Lol. Who do you think are the majority?
---
That was supposed to be one of the things that dedicated servers were for.  Being able to identify people that DC.
---
WHAT IN THE HOLY FUCK WERE THE DEVS THINKING MAKING IT SO LEGION CANT GRAB IN FRENZY?! HAD SURVIVORS FINISHING GENS DIRECTLY IN MY FACE WHILE I WAIT FOR THE 2 YEAR COOLDOWN COMING OUT OF FRENZY

is it just me or is it often russians that do this kind of shit
---
Ara Ara
---
This is quite possibly the shittest of the shitposts.
---
No one's saying it's easy and most people just want BHVR to do better because we love the game. It's fair enough to be disappointed with a lot of things in this game and I'm sure you'd agree. Biggest thing for me is communication. Like I'd like to know the Halloween event isn't ready before we're expecting it
---
I don't really understand why you would complain about Myers.  At least he's kinda spoopy and geared towards survivor fun.  I'd put Billy in that spot.  When you get to red ranks, I consider replacing Billy with God Huntress.
---
should have shown the full picture, but no that killing score would have given me the pip ma dude.
---
Yep. Main huntress and if I didn't have ruin to slow the game down at the beginning it would be so much more difficult to pressure gens effectively on large maps.
---
How do you have trap dad as your flair and still mix up your daddy with leather face?
---
I hope so! How do the events in this game work?? Also, a noob question. But how do Chapters work? They’re not story related are they? I guess the name caught me off guard and after purchasing the Stranger Things I was expecting some sort of story related content. But it’s strictly add ins for the multiplayer yeah?
---
Coincidence ?  i think not !
---
The image is untouched bar the names being blacked out.  It happened so suddenly that I was like o.O.
---
This would be terrifying on the lower level of the Game or on the Swamp.
---
Let's just ignore his build for a second and look at the problem here. BHVR is encouraging disconnecting by making it only remove 1 pip instead of 2, and now it also removes the possiblility for the killer to pip in high ranks because of removing the emblem progression for disconnected survivors. If all survivors disconnect at the right time in the game the killer gets a depip regardless of how good or fair he/she played and there is no counterplay for it. Good killer? Let's dc and make him depip...
---
Domt mind me just stealing the meme from above
---
well, match has lasted for 15 or 20 minutes and they haven't done their job. They are straight up holding the game hostage.
---
I didn't actually look at the killer power. I saw the loadout and point totals and just assumed
---
you ignored what I said and just repeated "if he died I would have pipped."  Well yeah, but you would have played a better game in general if you extended the match.  You're struggling to pip at rank 14 Lolololol
---
Alright a way to make that less op is to make so when their in the dying state ie on the ground then you full heal if your injured
---
&gt; first time here i assume.
---
devotion 6 red ranks at both sides
---
Myers worth buying?  He one hit us the other day but unsure if that’s this mori thing people talk about or if he always does that. (New player)

Yep, PC. This issue became worse with servers.
---
And i thought i was the only one
---
I think what would buff regression perks and improve the problem of gen speed a lot is if survivors couldn't just tap regressing gens. Imho they should have to repair at least the amount regressed plus 5% (max 20% total) to stop the gen from regressing again once they leave.
---
Thank you sir, you too.
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Where them girls at
---
I mean its not like it matters without ruin, but yea with ruin definitely stop
---
When he reaches tier 3 he can 1 hit down you for a limited amount of time. He has to stalk you and other survivors 1st though. With add ons it can take longer but he could possibly kill you without even hitting you.
---
If a survivor ever boops my snoot if im playing amanda i always let them escape
---
Might just delete this post and remake it because there are way too many dumb F\*cks in here who don't see the problem and are only here to make fun of ranks, real mature.
---
Quick and clean shouldve been the 40 level perk

isn't this considered over-saturated content now, according to the rules, about the spamming on '69' and '420' nonsense?

Report: I'm in this photo and I don't like it.

No I don't think they fix themselves. However it will give the devs a few weeks to fix the issues. If that's not enough time then you should not be thankful for a buggy mess. Unless you're a delusional fanboy.

How can I actually read this? Whenever I click on it, it's really small and doesn't upsize when I click to zoom in.

Running NOED is his choice, but not being able to pip, because someone else disconnected, that's just unfair.

Then I try my first killer game ever and get put with three green ranked survivors and a 20, all four of which have either Dead Hard or Decisive Strike somehow and I'm like cool guys enjoy your free escape this game sure is fun and balanced.
---
Range will still be 64 meters. Duration will just be 10 seconds
---
Quick and clean should be a bonus of like 5%, not 25% and 50% is flat out ridiculous.   
---
it has no conditionals like the two much weaker perks that do a similar effect, and the percentage difference is crazy.  Do you really want gen time to go from about 90 seconds to 45?  Everyone would run it.
---
The doctor would fuck the trapper up
---
I fixed it by doing the following:
---
1. I uninstalled DBD on Steam
---
2. I deleted the DBD files from my D:Drive (External Hard Drive).
---
3. I deleted the Easy Anti Cheat files from my C:Drive (Internal Hard Drive)
---
4. I checked windows for updates and installed one that was called .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.5, plus there was a compatibility for windows update to be installed as well.
---
5. I updated my NVIDIA GRD Driver through the NVIDIA Experience
---
6. I reinstalled DBD on my C:Drive (Internal Hard Drive)
---
7. I ran DBD through Steam, and had the first installation of Easy Anti Cheat installed in that process.
---
8. The game has worked flawlessly since then, with no disconnects.
---
Could've been the Windows Updates that I neglected, it could've been because my game was running on an external drive instead of the internal drive, and it could've been the Graphics Card update that I neglected. 
---
Anyways, I hope one of those things works for you.
---
This. I wish BHVR would finally change and just do these super obvious and needed buffs. Should be easy enough to implement especially compared to a full rework of a killer
---
Yes, it would apply when you have the perk. They are not good perks on their own, or the best when combined. The same can be said about no mither, though, as it needs other perks to do well, and it still would be bad.
---
Saw this earlier when I was half asleep and didn't notice the last board says three bugs instead of two, that shit's funny!
---
hi otz
---
lmfao you are so salty
---
you definitely camped them
---
There is little to compare to the thrill of yoinking someone off a gen 20 seconds into the match and you know you spooked the shit out of them.
---
I will admit to having DCed after getting tunneling camping wraiths 3 games in a row yesterday. 
---
*hangs head in shame*
---
Or atleast quick and clean should last for like 3 seconds at most its faster then the freaking new part add on
---
Your friend missed an opportunity for Freddy to say ‘DARN’ as he gets shot.
---
so like struggling in rank 14? 4th game after rank reset and then instantly winning by getting a 4k with 4 traps at the start of the game. well leave the winning part out since uknow, killer score bug :)
---
Heres the thing though, they should not be pushing out content update to update. They should have more structure in place so instead they could potentially release things earlier than delay them. 
---
Like if you have a paper due tomorrow that you were given a month to complete, and your computer breaks the night before its on you if wasn't ready. Things can get in the way, but its still your fault.
---
You circled... the reagents?
---
Gotta love those thief’s and then repost!
---
I absolutely despise running ruin, but after rank 10 or so it is a must. Give me a viable alternative and ruin will go in a trash pile quick.
---
That sounds op. Might get him :)
---
There was a big where you could get a gen so close to finishing without actually finishing it that its aura would disappear to the killer. It was a very interesting mind game.  
---
Also the hooks on the map were determined by what killer it was allowing you to find out who you were playing against instantly. They fixed that in the Myers chapter. 
---
As someone already mentioned once you did all 5 gens you could still go back and do the other two for more bloodpoints which made some games take forever. 
---
Infinites existed that if the survivors run it good then the killer would never be able to catch up (way before bloodlust existed)
---
Exhaustion didnt exist allowing you to stack sprint burst, adrenaline, and balanced landing once nea came out and they all worked on their separate timers.
---
Sabo was THE perk early on because breaking a hook destroyed it forever usually leading to every hook except the basement hooks.
---
Someone mentioned the glitch with killers getting surv perks but it also worked the other way. My favorite was bringing noed as surv to see the killers reaction.  You could also stack perks and bring 4 of the same perk.  Urban evasion was definitely the best and you would crouch walk slightly slower than sprinting.
---
You don't need the perk. Its for people who don't know totem spots. Totems can literally never have broken spots on the maps we have now because you can just learn the spots.

It essentially reduces your terror radius to 20m for survivors repairing solo, that's 4 meters more than what monitor and abuse does if you're a 32 radius killer.
---
Killers like bubba, billy, nurse, plague, myers t3, would all really benefit from giving the survivors less warning. The note about if your terror radius is shorter is so it won't give away stealth killers.
---
My issue with Pop is that the time saved is often negated by a number of factors like the time it took to kick the gen, how many survivors are on it, etc. 20% regression for 1 survivor on 1 gen is awesome, but it's nothing for 2 survivors when you factor in the time spent kicking it.

once the gens are completed, go play Civilization 5 for 1/2/3 weeks
---
Farm on them.  Let them get those unhooks, slug them, kick some gens,  you were in control of the match almost immediately.  You applied too much pressure and killed them off before you could make the points for the game.  
---
  Playing killer isn't just about how fast you kill the entire lobby, it's about amassing blood points too.  If you one hook kill someone you're depriving yourself of atleast 2 more chases, 4 hits/traps, and 2 hooks.
---
Bill is better. His perks are very good.

The event is tied into the Rift this year. Getting progress through the free track of the rift will give you vials.

It’s still very strong, but even if the spirit is good, a full coordinated SWF is stronger. If you don’t have sights, you let your team know and they can gen tap to avoid being grabbed. If your friend is in a chase and she phases, your friend can let you know.

I'd be more likely to use Surge if they changed it from a radius to simply that each time you downed someone, it blew up and regressed the closest unfinished generator with progression to the downed Survivor. Similar cooldown. Then, as a bonus, make it so that if anyone was working on the generator that exploded, it kicks them off of it completely and it can't be worked on for a handful of seconds, say, five or six, with an animation of flying sparks for the duration so Survivors know what happened and when they can work on the generator again. Run it alongside Thrilling Tremors and you've got Survivors sitting on their hands doing nothing for even longer.
---
This way, Surge can be stronger, but also realistically countered by choosing to waste time working on generators for a handful of seconds as you traverse the map early game. It won't be as strong as Ruin, but it'll still be a Survivor time waster and a potential alternative choice to Ruin.
---
Get a nice trifecta of generator time wasters going, with Ruin, Surge, and Corrupt Intervention. More choices is never bad.
---
I do.
---
Myers front and center I like it
---
Lol guys imagine being this mad over anything said in a DBD sub, ever 
---
Anyway bottom line Daddy Myers come hit this
---
New patch = new bugs
---
Ok
---
He edited it since my first comment.  It's still stronger than resilience for no reason with the "nerf."
---
Nobody realises how insanely good BL is on mt. Ormond, creates some nasty infities there
---
Iv'e noticed a common trend that some survivors do since Legion came out. If a killer is powerful, instead of whining that they are "OP" they'll say that they're not fun to play against. This whining will make the devs think that the killer needs a change and because the devs don't know how to re-balance an ability without directly nerfing it, they'll get "reworked" which is just a fancy term for a nerf. 
---
Course this only applies to a few survivors, some are fine in the fact that they acknowledge only prayer beads needs a nerf and spirit base kit is actually fine.
---
Okay. I’ll just get Jake to 30 then dip. Thanks for the feedback bro
---
r/confusedeverything
---
You mean weak? He actually saw it, if he was a coward he wouldn’t even go there
---
enjoy speaking your mind on reddit while you can, without doubt whatever commie government you live under will be working to censor it soon enough. :)
---
Holy shit this is the best fan art I’ve seen in a long time. Huge respect to you👍
---
Great, first Shirtless Myers, then gown Myers, now hot girl Myers. Stooooop.
---
too abusable
---
Gotcha!
---
SWF is toxic tho
---
But isnt the grind half the fun?
---
Badass, I love it and its now my home screen.
---
On a side note... do they have tiny heads or is it just me.
---
When my group and I play together if we find out there a Ruin we start searching for the totem before touching any more Gens.
---
I wish they would Nerf ruin
---
Will do, comrade! Keep being mad about it, which in turn will make me literally immortal from all the life it gives me.
---
I thought they agreed on Nea’s bitches
---
Fiona from Demento
---
I await my downvotes
---
I'm just gonna admire this art work.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Yup, slugging is the best way to win and always has been.  Game seems designed around it too
---
Seconded!!!
---
His "I'm All Ears" video had plenty of I'm All Ears value, because the entire video I was All Ears to see the value.
---
Why is mikeys head so fuckin small compared to his body 😂😂. Side note: this is badass af
---
Nah
---
Yeah don't unlock calm spirit unless you get really triggered by Doctor.  it's a waste unlocking that and having it show up in your other blood webs, like No Mither, or Open Handed.  
---
I honestly regret leveling up all my survivors and killers sometimes because it adds more to the grind when new content comes out.
---
Hilarious that you think I'm mad. I'm just wasting your time. the more you reply to me, the less you're spreading your dog shit political beliefs around the internet. :)
---
It's also the only exhaustion perk that can help you get to a safe loop if you happen to be working on a gen in a deadzone. SB definitely has its uses.
---
Why the fck is this getting downvoted? You are just showing a fact and there is nothing salty in your comment.
---
Looks like an anime where the killers were summoned to stop an Avenger level threat
---
Flip-Flop OP
---
Fair point!
---
The back up was corrupted, maybe?
---
I could do this all day babey, your rage is top quality entertainment
---
Don’t stop. I’m close.
---
Doc is a kinky boy.
---
Myers at the basement😳😳who he gonna kill?🤔🤭😳
---
Tbh running dead hard and balanced landing is one of my favorite big brain moves.
---
FUCKING PAY ME OFF WITH DOUBLE BLOODPOINTS BEHAVIOUR, THIS IS YOUR FUCK-UP AND I EXPECT YOU TO FUCKING RECTIFY IT.
---
Get used to it. It won't stop lol
---
yep, keep wasting your time. I'll be here.
---
Wasn't it an anniversary thing? It might not be accessible until the next annual event. Or it might just be bugged
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dm2pds/these_hex_totems_sure_do_look_weird/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Is he though? Bill chose his fate. He didn't die trying to fight off monsters/killers in a 1v1 like you see in slasher movies and predator he died trying to buy time for the rest of the survivors from a endless horde of monsters stronger than any DBD killer. He wasn't planning to survive. Also a Witch, Tank, Smoker and Hunter are all gonna give survivors bigger issues than a majority of the DBD Killers. Simply due to them always being near common infected, requiring headshots, and the special infected having powers and higher brain functions that allow them to do things like plan ahead, ambush and hunt in ways that cause survivors to make bad decisions. IMO him and Ash would both be on the winning side due to experience with supernal "unkillable" foes, experience scavenging for weapons on the spot, and Military experience/Literally the chosen one.
---
Add the "ゴゴゴゴ" and its a very good jojo crossover
---
I just play bbq if i want points since i have it maxed on leather
---
I would love for it to only be active for something like 2 minutes. That way it slows the game down to give the killer some time to gain momentum, and it expires so it doesn't hold the late game hostage if they can't find it and one is already dead.
---
A slugged survivor is not working on gens. Red ranks will crank out gens quickly if they have nothing else to do. Slugging a survivor or two is sometimes just necessary.
---
And with some killers (Legion, Spirit) who can rack up hits quickly, getting hits on people that aren’t the Obsession is incredibly easy and can make chases with them last just about as long as someone’s dedication to only sucking on a Tic Tac.
---
I would watch the shit out of this anime
---
Yeah but they will fix OoO in next patch, it won't detect Ghostface during shroud or any killer with hidden effect so that's cool
---
I'm aware of that.... and people say killer takes more skill when they can just cheese 2 win
---
You found the killers that it did work with and made sure to change it so it didn’t?
---
&gt; It is possible to be injured and useful for a bit lol. You don't always need to seek out a heal the moment you're injured.
---
I know... that's why the *first* thing I said was
---
&gt; I don't use it too much
---
I don't disagree with you at all, if you're self caring every time the killer hits you then **you are wasting time.** I'm just saying that there *certain* situations where I think it's good insurance. That's all.
---
It has some anti-camping potential to it, which is an idea I really like. Extending the 1 minute struggle timer by 34 seconds just doubles down on the whole "Do not camp people" incentive WHILE making a huge difference in those once a game clutch moments.
---
Shouting SAVE ME! To the duo partner who manages to get to you just a few seconds too late and suddenly that perk allows you to live. Or just stopping by you as the killer chases them and allow another survivor head over and save you in the added 34 seconds. 
---
Again, great idea and solid execution....but does it really compare to the good perks? Can anything compare to the good perks?
---
I’d say Wraith is angry-hurt.
---
I can't know what you've seen but I've found a lot of the time it's justified. Saw a killer down a guy trying to unhook, and kept him on the ground since he had a hook and a slug within feet of each other. Pretty justified, he could guard half the team in one space.
---
The good news is you can create distance and force them them to hook you, or if there's already distance, you can recover to near full and let someone tag you for a split second for a pickup. Or if you're expecting it as you say you can use a couple perks made to counter slugging. It's only a big play for the killer when they have little pressure to patrol.
---
I alsways ask people them why they give up if a survivor or killer DCs
---
You must be new here.
---
absolutely sexy, now we wait for the killer gorls
---
typical newbie
---
What you wanna talk about :)
---
Hey op great job on this comic you've done. It brings some actual personality to the characters and you've done it within the lore so to say too. Really man be proud of what you've done I'll be watching the sub for part 2. Are you intending to bring in more killers?
---
Haha yeah. I’ve used adrenaline in a completely swf party for strategies, like having my friend 99 a gen until I get hit through a pallet and then pop it. It’s helpful with campers sometimes if no one is running borrowed. I agree it’s not the same as the others though.
---
It's almost like they could make countless changes to improve the game but don't because it's been so successful in its shitty state for so long they're afraid to do anything about it. Wow, Ruin is 100% necessary on the majority of killers despite it being a fucking terrible perk, maybe we should nerf it and adjust generator progression/slow the game down a bit. What's that? Actual effort? Fuck that here's some new skins. Then they add all of these new perks that fuck with generators that are 100% completely inferior to Ruin in every way and affect the meta in 0 ways. Hey use this Ruin replacement that puts entity blockers on generators for 90 seconds, good thing you can't walk another 20 ft and get on another gen.
---
Do you know how lame it is that the perk meta is has basically been the same for so long? Despite the countless amount of perks in the game and how they always add similar ones that are just inferior versions of the current meta perk? It's so annoying. No one forces you to play meta perks but try having fun playing fun builds at red ranks
---
I hate this, especially when I’m running Deliverance and need that first unhook for it to work.
---
People use Deliverance?
---
Overcharge and pop goes the weasel doesn't work with Surge right, so surveillance should also only be applied if you kicked it yourself.
---
My best friend doesn't want to play the game because I've complained about it to her so much she thinks it's shit and I'm very sad about it.
---
Also shut the fuck up stop attacking me that's my job
---
There’s more than enough counterplay available if the killer is trying to slug everyone. Perks, teammates, etc. Killers at high ranks are looking for any way to pressure survivors, good survivors anticipate and counter common killer tactics
---
Is it fun to have every killer and then when a new killer comes out, you have to spend countless amounts of BP just to get the perks you want? Is it fun to be gimped and barely able to play certain killers or succeed because you don't own x killer, don't have the shards to buy it, don't have the time to farm, or whatever else? "The grind" is what makes people shy away from the game. The fun in a game comes from the game being fun, not the game not being fun because you have to grind to have any sort of a chance in it.
---
~5 skill checks per gen is complete bull.  It’s **at least** ~8 (1 per 10 sec)
---
Ruin is better in every way. On consoles, especially with Switch’s max 20 fps it just hurts to deal with Ruin.
---
TFW the only other 'Halloween' event I can play right now is Overwatch
---
And that event sucks ass
---
Maybe the legion wouldn't be so bad, I guess I could tolerate Amanda too. Anyone else I just don't see myself clicking with. What about you, any preferences other than the ones you've mentioned?
---
Oh of course! I’ll definitely draw more killers in my comic. Even I can’t wait for the next chapter. I’m so happy you liked my art, Bloody Nea😄
---
this is why I play trapper lol
---
If 3-4 survivors are going down that easy to be slugged, they deserved to lose.
---
That's still 4 survivors that need to be chased and downed and no one is being hooked in the meantime.
---
So you have the potential to revive the entire team and continue on still with no hooks.
---
A good group can see the slugging happen and know to keep out of the terror radius range and keep hidden until it's safe to revive someone.
---
A bad group will stick close and try to revive out in the open.
---
I WAS CHASING SOMEONE AND WHEN THEY GOT TO A STRETCH WHERE I WAS GOING TO CATCH THEM AND DOWN THEM, THEY JUST STOPPED AND WAITED FOR ME.  I HIT THEM TO PUT THEM INTO THE DYING STATE EXCEPT THEY WERE FULLY HEALED AND RUNNING AWAY FROM ME.  FUCK THAT FUCKING BUG.
---
Of course I hunted him down and tunneled him, then got the 4k.  Don't give me permission to play toxic, I'm the killer, I can do it way better than you.
---
Depends on how you play her. 
---
If you're using the standard all-seeing perk build and you're slapping headgear on everyone at the start of the match, then yes, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
About 1 million
---
yes and no depends on the situation.  
---
for an example if I am having a hard time finding a survivor 2 gens get popped I know someone is working on the 3rd I find a survivor and now it is a race I down them hook them and now if I leave without any info where more people are I am giving up a place where I could possibly make a play \*I mainly play trapper so leaving would hurt me even more\* I have to make a choice if someone goes for the save Tunnel and risk a BT or hope I can win the next chase against the unhooker fast enough.
---
it is just these choices where slugging can get you map pressure and end a game
---
Why, cuz he's BLACK. U FUCKIN RACSIT
---
Oh mah lord you did it to 'em
---
About 800k-900k depending on how efficient you are at webs. Maybe even 750 or so
---
Flip-Flop, Unbreakable, Boil Over.
---
Good luck getting a hook!
---
And he is arguably worse for that very same reason. No one doubts the ability of basement bubba, but that is the only situation where he is good. If you are an optimal survivor you will not get chainsawed by him even if you get a indoor map if the survivor knows how to loop, which will leave bubba a m1 killer.
---
Both.
---
I've done the math myself and if you don't hit Greats and are unlucky Ruin can make a generator take nearly **double** the time. At Red ranks where people reliably hit Greats it'll still take the time away from Greats as well as the occasional good (no one hits all Greats; we're not machines) so that it takes 25% longer, which for zero investment is huge. Yes Ruin can be cleansed but that's still time spent looking for the totem, and on some maps (particularly the new ones [Badham rework, Underground complex]) totems can be nearly impossible to find without Small Game which people don't want to run because "Gotta have my DS Adred BT DH build."
---
But on the other hand... well yeah Surge, but also perks like... I mean honestly other than Surge, Pop Goes, and Overcharge we don't really have any generator speed perks that aren't Ruin. Yes basically every Killer since Leatherface has had a perk that *interacts* with generators (Thrilling Tremors, Corrupt Intervention, Discordance, Rancor [when a gen is completed], Surveillance, etc.) but the only perks that truly "stall" the gens are Surge, Pop Goes, Overcharge, Ruin, and perhaps Corrupt Intervention. *Maybe* Thrilling Tremors if you're unbelievably lucky.
---
The problem is honestly tied more to base gen speeds than anything, as well as the strength of toolboxes. BHVR is scared of giving Killers a "reliable" "uncounterable" gen stall perk because they realize it would be unfun and I honestly agree. But the fun of four shouldn't trump the fun of one. I'd be okay with weak gen stall perks if gens weren't already so easy to do.
---
None. I learned the game without exhaustion perks so I don't use them.
---
Gens took 40 seconds to complete at launch. Now it’s doubled. You really want to make this game more of a M1 simulator?
---
DH still bc it is reliable and something u choose urself when to use to create distance never to wiff hits
---
&gt;Sloppy Butcher and Thanataphobia
---
This can be completly ignored for our discussion as it applies to a survivor healing himself as much as to any survivor healing you, the 2 second diffrence gives this a maximum of half second disadvantage tops which can be ignored. 
---
&gt;she removed herself out of the game for lols.
---
"For lols" you mean for not dying, beeing downed takes you out of the game for a quite long time as well and if she died it would have been a permanent 3v1 which is way worse even if she did Gens for 10 seconds.  Also beeing fully healed allows you to prolong chases way more then if yoy get insta downed, even more so against stealth killers. 
---
Also "walking to find a mend spot"? Self care can be done literally anywhere whilst beeing healed requires you to find another player first which in my experience takes way longer.  Following your suggestion and doing stuff until you find someone else you are way more easily detectable  due to grunts. 
---
&gt; She really "earned" that escape, I was happy for her.
---
 This entire passage just makes you sound extrenly toxic. She had the killer chase her 5 times and got away, which in your average game gave each of you at least 45 seconds, so 2 minutes and 15 seconds of unbotherd gen progress for taking herself out of the game for a minute, even if she did literally walk around for no reason after she escaped like you suggested. 
---
Im a killer main and I only play swf for a few times a month, but all my survivor friends are rank 5 or better and they all run self care when they play alone or with 2 people. Im curious why you seem to dislike it so much and your so far presented arguments couldnt really explain that to me.
---
It's not a bad perk, but there's a reason a lot of people don't run it. Pop sometimes forces you to go out of your way to kick a gen, and in that time you might end up having to ignore a survivor that gives them time to get to a loop or two, which means it doesn't do any favors for creating pressure or buying time at all. It can very easily work against you, whereas Ruin can allow you to play aggressively and try and get that first survivor down and on a hook, so those 30 seconds to a minute your Ruin may only be up for ends up creating your first burst of map pressure and pulling 2 or even 3 if you're lucky, survivors off gens. Pop would be more valuable toward the later part of the game however, when you have fewer gens to manage and, hopefully, fewer survivors. It's a great perk, but I don't see it being better than Ruin
---
How long did this take you to do?
---
I'm with you there! I think it's really fun to play to the nature of the killer and produce a game full of SPOOPS! Whether I get many kills or not, I always find it satisfying to scare (or try to scare) my fellow players. It's fun!
---
Thank you so much I kept losing chaces because of this
---
Myers: Why are you running away from D a d d y?
---
I JUST WANT TO PLAY ONE GAME WHERE I’M NOT TUNNELED! I PLAY JEFF FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! GO AFTER THE NEA WITH THE FLASHLIGHT OR THE BLENDETTE! OR THE GUY WHO CONSTANTLY FAILS SKILLCHECKS! LEAVE ME ALONE! IF I ALREADY RAN YOU TWO GENS, DON’T GO AFTER ME AS SOON AS I’M OFF THE DAMN HOOK!
---
DS is meta. Its counter is slugging
---
You are literally asking me to treat them like pigs, is this standard? To just not kill them and be like "Hey I need you guys to heal so I can keep downing you and then hang you all so I don't depip." that sounds like BM'ing with extra steps.
---
And there's little to compare to the absolute pants-shitting thrill of getting yanked off a gen 20 seconds into a match!! It's a great time. You can't even be mad!
---
except it isn't
---
That's cute and I appreciate you!
---
Me personally without the grind I have nothing to work for. Yeah the game is fun, but becomes repetitive without something to work for and therefore boring. That's just me. Having access to everything up from the beginning just seems silly.
---
AS A KILLER MAIN I JUST WANNA PLAY THE GAME, IF PEOPLE DC BECAUSE I OUTPLAYED THEM THEN MORE THAN LIKELY I WILL JUST TRY TO QUICKLY END THE GAME SO I CAN HAVE AN ACTUAL MATCH. IF YOU FIND THE HATCH FIRST YOU FIND IT, BUT IM NOT GONNA WASTE TIME LOOKING FOR A HATCH OR FARMING, AND WHEN I PLAY WITH FRIENDS IN SWF (WERE NEVER A FULL GROUP) I EXPECT THE KILLERS TO TREAT US THE SAME WAY I DO.
---
THOUGH THE LOW RANK KILLERS ALWAYS CONFUSE THE FUCK OUT OF ME, ESPECIALLY RANK 18 NURSES.
---
Honestly ive been in the same boat lately. Im starting to doubt ruin because it gets cleansed so fast in red and purple ranks. Some killers like Myers need ruin (to get out of tier 1) but I feel most dont. Because is it really worth it when the first gens always pop fast anyways.
---
Summon Summon!
---
Both sides end the match with more points possibly pips on their end too.  
---
If this is how you feel in yellow to green ranks buddy do I have a surprise for you when you try to pip at red rank.
---
Apparently there's meant to be an Adidas crossover, imagine your soldier decked out in full slav armour.
---
this is badass pretty much all around. would make a sick ass tattoo
---
no problem, please continue making these!
---
I've said countless times as a Survivor main that I'd totally be fine with gens taking 20 seconds longer if Ruin made gens regress by 1%/2%/3% and they perhaps buffed the other gen stall perks a bit.
---
Thanataphobia is a hard one because put bluntly Killers like Plague and Legion exist. For certain Killer you can injure everyone incredibly easy and snowball immensely. I think Thana will inherently always be a "problem" perk, at least as long as Legion and Plague exist.
---
Somebody must have changed that because I had checked that before not even a day ago and it said cause of death
---
 
---
Edit: I'm not say it was you but you are using a desktop in which you could change the wiki. Also Dick Halloren notes used to have something there now it's blank
---
i feel surge could already be alot better if it did not have a range
---
nope
---
You really don't like the new skins?
---
I thought Tracer's looked sick.
---
I like horror movies... and I also like Dead By daylight...
---
Surveillance does work with surge. Surveillance only requires the generator to be regressing, it does not require you to kick it.
---
In red ranks? Yeah, obviously it is required if you want to actually win. Slugging
---
1 - Downs a survivor
---
2 - pulls another survivor off a gen
---
3 - allows you to pressure another gen while 
---
4 - you have the location of 2 survivors when the slugged survivor gets up 
---
5 - avoids a potential DS
---
"Doing poorly the whole time" is a pretty ignorant thing to say when it's really easy to get shit on as a lot of killers in the early game when all of the pallets are up, but I guess if you lack braincells you'd have a hard time figuring this stuff out. It's a good thing we have people like you who are just in general bad at the game and have no understanding of it, when all you see every game to ever be played "killer only tunnel, camp, or slug" because you need an excuse for not winning.
---
Games in red ranks against good survivors aren't going to go well if killers play the way you want them to play, but then I guess if they played that way, you'd have loads of fun each and every game.
---
Funny that in order to counter great skillchecks you need to bring ruin, because that's only perk that reliably undo great skillcheck bonuses.
---
No ruin - 4 survs do gens, some of them with bonuses from greats.
---
Ruin - variable, sometimes it's 3 survs do gens, sometimes all 4 do gens, but surely without bonuses from greats (and ruin is still in the game).
---
So it's a win-win anyway.
---
I definitely understand the sentiment, BUT sometimes you just want a real game and don't want to spend all the extra time to farm with survivors. And I think that's fine, too. There's no need to salt at someone because they didn't behave in a specific way.
---
Let's all just have some understanding for all our fellow players, give people the benefit of the doubt, and roll with it :)
---
Excuse me sir that's the entity. Nea isnt real
---
WHY THE FUCK AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS HOOKED AFTER SLUGGING EVERYONE ELSE
---
I've played since release bud I'm as old as they get in the community.
---
oop sorry
---
Interesting, that sounds like it's worth trying.
---
Confession: I play on the Switch
---
I often play bubba when i don't want to kill anyone.
---
I don't farm though, i just play normal. When one survivor has been two hooked i usually slug them or just ignore them. It's not too hard getting 32k BP that way.
---
When i get to higher ranks and survivors are getting too good for bubba i use huntress in the same way.
---
pretty much. People got no patience nowadays
---
About 3 months. Well I was quite busy and had a lot of other art work. Hope I can post the next chapter before this Christmas.
---
Oh don't worry I've been in red ranks, only difference is that people in red ranks are a lot more confident. Yeah they are better at looping n stuff but I get these kinds of trapper games in red ranks more often than green and yellow, just takes more time to catch them in the first place.
---
POP
---
Why did you just call out my trapper &gt;:(
---
Was it because of a power outage? Do you have a source for that, cause I haven't seen it.
---
And I've said it once I've said it a hundred times: the fact that they announced it a *day before* the event is what's erking most people. Even under the context of "shit happens" it's really unprofessional that Behaviour left these last minute tweaks to the literal last minute instead of giving themselves a longer grace period to iron out the bugs.
---
I think people would've been a lot happier if they just said the event was going to come out next week and then if everything went according to plan they released it a week early.
---
~~But I mean the Halloween event is already starting halfway into October my lord.~~
---
I am seriously ready for Late Halloween tho. Why not??? More Halloween! It's awesome!
---
Survivors only have two base ways of defending themselves. Running and hiding. 
---
If you have trouble with them hiding you've probably grown too dependent on locater perks (BBQ, NC and so on).
---
Try getting back into the swing of playing without them. And maybe play Surv yourself a bit more. You learn a lot by observing other players.
---
I dont main survivor or killer, but Everytime I do play survivor and the killer is farming, Its always a trapper for some reason.
---
Its 9/10 chances that the farming killer is a trapper, for me atleast.
---
So I guess personally I like farming with trapper, simply because im used to farming with Trappers all the time.
---
The huntress could throw me over her shoulder any god damn day of the week 
---
Also Amanda good thinking
---
Its a symptom of a bigger problem. Yes in most games there will arise at least on circumstance where you have to slug. Its just better to slug then snap onto another target than to hook the downed survivor and let the other target hide.
---
Lithe or SB
---
Announcing the delay over a Tweet was honestly a mistake. They should've made an official forum post with some more info about what happened. 250 character limit is a joke.
---
Menacing
---
Pop is a very good Killer perk so I would suggest that.
---
Personally I love having a level 40 clown gathering dust instead of a level 1 clown gathering dust
---
ah, I forgot about huntress. I guess I wouldn't say no to her.
---
I must’ve thought I replied to a different comment, honestly my response makes no sense to your comment.
---
Typical Steve.
---
I have nothing against hiding. As a survivor, I normally play stealthy.
---
My problem comes from survivors who do nothing but hide until the killer dcs. You cant track because they leave no scratch marks or blood and dont disturb crows. So they just wait 30 minutes until they're either found or they get bored enough to dc.
---
Thanks! I'll probably go for pop
---
It is the same update. I'm not sure exactly when it's coming. As far as I know, the devs only said that it was delayed until thw midchapter patch.
---
Don't push yourself too hard tho. Fan content is great but I would much rather anyone who takes pride in their work take as much time as they need and get it to where they're happy. So take your time man.
---
Your main premise is ‘they didn’t do it on purpose’. No one is saying they did - but it’s still incompetent
---
No DC?
---
Color me surprised.
---
Y U P
---
Maybe if survivors stopped being toxic we would not have to face these issues
---
i mean, is he ever not?
---
Ghostbusters reference?
---
You guys I’m just trolling ;]
---
I will never take the time to learn every spot of every map. If I don't figure I out passively from playing then that totem isnt getting found lol
---
I mean the actual event itself. There's maybe 1 or two skins I care about other than that the event is just as shitty as it's been every year, except now there's no incentive to play after you get your 9 Ws for the week. God forbid they think of something new instead of just giving us Junkenstien for the 3rd time
---
Thank you😄✨✨✨

Bruh this is simple. Just grab some of that weird carbon paper, print an image, grab a wood plank and saw it to a small piece, sandwich the 3 pieces together (image on top, wood on bottom, carbon paper in middle), grab your favorite pen and push hard as you trace the outline. It transfers to the wood, next you trace again but this time on the wood itself with your pen. Done. Anything else is custom. This is just basic woodshop stuff my lad.
---
Pop is a top 5 killer perk, Dark Devotion is a gimmick perk at best.
---
You gotta aim between the shoulders towards the neck.  
---
The other big thing about blinds is WHEN you do it.  There are only two real times you want to use your flashlight and both of them are when the killer is locked into an animation.  You want to go for blinds when they kick apart pallets and when they pick up a survivor, otherwise you're wasting your battery or you're going to get popped because you're not creating distance.
---
I agree on both sides. Adding more time to generators is needed since the game moves too fast at higher ranks for killers to be effective.  However more time on the generators is a boring thing for survivors.
---
How about this.
---
Remove ruin. All generators now take 3 minutes to complete. However there is now a secondary objective: A power Relay station. If a Survivor activates a power relay station, all generators go from needing 120 charges to fully repair (3 minutes) to 80 charges to repair (2 minutes). It would essentially be a more powerful ruin until done.
---
It could have some interesting gameplay interactions depending on how it is designed. Just one Relay station that takes a while to complete, or multiple stations (2-4?) that only cut the time down when all are done.
---
I want this so bad right now

Healing is the survivor’s counter to  teammates being downed at the door, but karma dictates that if they get downed being toxic assholes, the nontoxic ones should just leave lol.

Right maybe this wouldn’t be a problem if you knew how to be efficient with gens? They should never take long if you are efficient. learn to do gens and you wouldn’t have to worry about those pesky players who take 32 seconds to heal thanks by the way for being a prime example of the toxic gamers  who really ruin this community getting mad because somebody uses a perk that you don’t
---
I literally heard the pillar man theme in my head while looking at the picture. What has the internet done to me... it's amazing
---
Maybe have ruin start working more and more the more gens or downs are completed
---
survivors happy that disconnecting influences killer ranks, I see no other reason why you would downvote his comment.

I see nothing wrong with it. Maybe a little more info after would be nice, I think the major issue is timing and the consistency of pushing things back

Probably because he does it so much, especially in the show.

This artwork is really good. Love Legion's pose. Bubba and Trapper look real menacing, and Myers, Doc, and Freddy all got spooky poses too.
---
I feel like this is programming in a nutshell
---
Or you can use fixated with it, and walk at a decent speed. Also works well if you are being farmed off of hook, or caught by stealth killer on a gen. Just because you don’t like the perk, doesn’t mean it’s bad. I agree that lots of players use it poorly, but I prefer it over buggy 30fps dead hard on console. Don’t need a window or ledge either.

I swear i get the worst maps for it. *Then I switch my build*

Does hitting a survivor with feral frenzy give a stack of STBFL?
---
&gt; If 3-4 survivors are going down that easy to be slugged, they deserved to lose.
---
I played a match the other day against a Billy who did not do well at all. He only got a couple hooks the entire game and had one after gens were finished. Billy was camping the survivor pretty hard. I went in to try and get a save but Billy is a tough one to get camping saves against and I went down. Not a big deal; it was my first hook so whatever. But my teammates refused to take a hit as I was being carried to save the hooked survivor. So Billy dropped me and slugged the other two within seconds.
---
It was the only way he could get the kills and it was 100 percent on us.
---
Tbh in that case I would probably just run Deliverance. With Camaraderie you are still relying on random blueberries to come near your hook and actually try to help you instead of sitting frightened on the other side of the map. With Deliverance I can activate it myself and help myself later on. Even if it has the minor downside of being useless if you are on the first hook.
---
I think part of the issue is that at the beginning, the survivors have the advantage because they can have things like tool box and stuff so they can find a gen and be done stupid fast while a killer is stuck on the other side of the map.
---
You could nerf ruin and leave the other gen stall perks as is, but if you do that there should be a buff for killer's at the start of the match. Maybe for the first 2-3 seconds that a killer can start moving, the aura of the farthest survivor is revealed so the killer has a better chance at the start to put pressure.
---
The only other thing I can think of that hasn't been suggested is instead of only 5 gens being completed to power the gates it would have to be all of them(or nearly all of them).
---
Double stack apples and you got a healthy salt stew
---
IF YOU WANT TO TEABAG ME WHEN IM KILLER GO RIGHT AHEAD, BUT IF IM PLAYING GHOSTFACE DON'T ACT ALL FUCKING SURPRISED WHEN I GIVE IT BACK TWICE AS HARD!
---
True
---
i would prefer just a longer gen time in general, maybe around 30 secs instead of buffing thana and other gen slow down perks. Mainly bc unlike ruin, those just suck all the fun out of the game. especially on someone like plague or freddy
---
He's my favourite too
---
Gee thanks man it was my first time making a GIF. watching it in slow motion had me laughing the entire time lol
---
For the benefit of doubt, I really hope they’re joking. 
---
But something tells me they aren’t.
---
I hate it when I’m on a gen with someone else, and I notice Myers stalking but the other guy doesn’t catch on. Even after I run away, like seriously TURN AROUND
---
Yeah don't take my tip from below as do it every time.  Just once per survivor tops, and it's about reading their reaction.  if they continue to commit to the loop break it, if they run off, cancel.
---
That doesn't make it any less likely. The Shrine is supposedly random.
---
This is way cooler than it should be

It is completely their fault. There is absolutely no excuse to not have backups of all their work for exactly this reason.
---
I have Mikey, and I saw some combo with him from Otzdarva where he used DD.
---
Why?
---
Slugging is good and healthy for the game. It's a strategy that gets rid of someone on a gen. Always go for hooks but if you need extra time. Slug. Slugging isn't op. You're just bad.
---

---
I wish they'd add exhaustion recovery while running to no mither.
---
It would make it so much better.
---
Gens go 2 fast, I dont like gen slow down meta but its kinda needed, you cant try to say gens dont go 2 fast. it sucks but its how the game was made
---
I miss old Sabo.
---
Current Sabo is just a dead perk
---
It’s an amazing perk for a lot of killers yes
---
As you'll come to see, people in this community are entitled and will DC at the idea of having to come up with any other strategy than running around in circles for 10 minutes. Instead of adapting and overcoming different playstyles, they will run to Reddit to scream for nerfs to killers instead of getting better at countering them. No matter if you m1'd them, mindgamed them, or played against a slew of Bs the survivors brought with em, run for the hills dude!

Isn't that like everyone all the time? The only time I play killer is when no one is online

A Hex perk for *Survivors*?
---
r/therewasanattempt
---
yeah, probably going to have to fire myself.
---
PS4 player, I can’t play killer without it. It helps my blind ass so much.
---
I'm not a red rank survivor, best I can do is purple, but i play solo queue a lot, and can say in my experience it's both too strong at low ranks, and too weak at high. It causes less experienced players to grind to a halt, and can make getting a single gen done a struggle, while high level red ranks in 4 man swfs treat it like a minor speed bump.
---
I'm no game designer, and this might be a terrible idea, but I think it should be changed in the following ways. 1.) Make it no longer be hex, and thus can't be cleansed. This forces veterans to deal with ruin the entire game, no exceptions. 2.) Remove the regression penalty from good skill checks. It would still pause the progress, but not regress. This would have minimal effect on high level players who are consistently able to get great skill checks, while reducing the penalty for new players who struggle at hitting great skill checks.
---
If these changes were made it would actually force veterans to deal with the slow down for the entire trial, and have a greater impact on them, while reducing the total slow down on less experienced players and in theory balance the perk better at both levels of play.
---
Like I said, I'm no game design/dbd expert but I think this would be a good change.
---
Freddy is easy he is not an S tier. Freddy still has humming when you are in the dream world and Ghost Face isn’t horrible you just need to be very observant really.
---
This looks like an anime intro
---
Excellent cropping you got there, half the pics are unreadable
---
It's because of the radius for hooking. You can't have a radius without a vacuum because of how the animation works. And you need a radius for hooking to be do-able and also to prevent old school facecamping where saves were literally impossible 
---
if they changed the animation so that the killer hooks the survivor from where they proc the prompt, there would be no hook vacuum but then it would look like the killer is hooking the survivor from too far away
---
Even if this wasn't true, comparing it to pallet vacuums is completely ridiculous
---
I honestly feel like we're being trolled at this point
---
IM MOVING AND MY INTERNET CANT BE HOOKED UPTIL MONDAY AND ILl BE TOO BUSY TO PLAY BEFORE I UNPLUG MY PC.
---
Pop goes is a great perk on a decent killer, clown may not be S tier but you can play him well. I managed to pull my friend off the infinite tractor by arching my bottle right.
---
&gt;Or they should just work after two hooks. The ability to end someone’s game in two seconds is moronic.
---
Mori on death hook is kinda pointless because you'd be better off hooking that survivor for possible BBQ reading, PGTW stack, etc.
---
If it's as you've described, then it's a bug. They removed that functionality in 2.4.0:
---
&gt; *Snap Out Of It is no longer affected by the A Nurse's Calling perk. Actions such as Snap Out Of It and Mending are not healing actions, thus perks should not affect them.*
---
i agree with green boi
---
Hex: Pretty Good Job
---
They should probably change borrowed to proximity rather than terror radius
---
FUCK GHOSTFACE I HATE PLAYING AGAINST HIM
---
What if u use enduring and I’m not laughing
---
bro i cant make them all myself, its up to you guys to help me out, it is an entire subreddit after all
---
My point still stands.
---
Fixated helps relieve this issue.
---
Honestly they could add The Thing easily, but not as a Mimic character.
---
It's a shape shifter, it could easily have multiple forms it could change between for different effects. Say a dog that can't attack, a form that reveals aura, and a "Standard" killer.
---
Then you've got three perks to make the Survivors not trust eacother and it works.
---
Maybe try not using object of obsession?
---
Then I'd definitely go with the option of finding people in the weekly thread and getting yourself a small group of regulars that share the same goals when playing as survivor.
---
You need to watch the video I linked.
---
I always spell it wrong
---
Ultra rare Addon: bullshit hit reg
---
Anyone here remember playing through the unhook lag for over a month? they brought someone in to help fix it. Was insane the moment you got unhooked and ran you would slingshot back to the killer and sometimes go down without them even being around you.
---
That too but I was just goin' along with the flow of the comments ;)
---
Make him slow, little to no terror radius, Survivors are always exposed.
---
Lets not make an overly complicated game with tons of different perks, add ons and items any more complicated than it is already.  
---
Dead by Daylight has been out for 3 years and counting now, this would be a complete shift in terms of meta and synergies.
---
A few months back I tried to provide some numbers and my own personal opinion on Hex: Ruin based on what numbers and figures are available. I think I might have been slightly off in my calculations but my findings agree with what you're saying: even if you hit all Greats, Ruin remains the best slowdown perk, and if you only hit Goods you are looking at sometimes doubling the repair time of a generator.

---
Nice xx😎👌
---
do you need to look up the definition of rude sir
---
&gt; The problem with reworking the objectives is that then you also have to mess with map generation since you need a whole new thing to spawn. additionally you also need to consider how perks and items interact with the relay station, and how exactly it has to work. 
---
You wouldn't really need a whole new spawn. You could stick it where a generator could spawn. Generators already have 10 to 20 spots depending on the map where they can spawn. So the generation would look for a non-occupied generator spot and then stick the relay station there. no item interaction like a door. maybe perk interaction down the line but it took them a good 2 years to finally add some door interaction.
---
&gt; If you made it add 40 charges to all gens, or remove 40 from the limit then it would be possible to do all gens at once by triggering the relay station after getting them all to 80 charges, which causes a new problem with the killers knowledge since they won't even know which generators are "done" and how is the relay station activated? 
---
Yes that was actually the point. If they do the relay station, the survivors have the power to complete 2-3 gens at once if they worked on them before. It adds a dynamic secondary objective and since it is able to complete multiple generators that have *already been worked on.*   
---
or a K.I.S.S. solution would be if the relay is off, generator repair is slowed by 30%. 
---
How long does it take? Should be 1-2 minutes so it would save you 3-4 minutes of overall time. It inself could be dynamic as well, requiring more time to reroute as more generators are done. giving it less value as an option overall the longer a match goes on. As the issue with ruin is that it's too punishing in the low ranks while being too useless in the high ranks. High rank killers want/need extra time but can't get it since survivors just work through ruin. Low rank survivors waste too much time by looking for the totem instead of just working through it. 
---
&gt; It would probably need to be either simple like a flat increase in generator repair time,  
---
which would be the most boring but simple solution
---
&gt;  it would need to be an entirely new objective between the current ones like needing to reroute the power from the generators to the doors, that could be a simple addition where the powered generators need to have their power routed to a door before it is powered 
---
a new phase in-between Generators and doors would cause more issues than just adding a side objective that is actually worth it. As the subjective already essentially exists (ruin) but would be moved from a perk to baked in to the game. 
---
Overall the game needs to be slowed down a bit and ruin removed (or changed). It's too punishing for low ranks and useless in high ranks (where the slow down is actually needed).
---

---

---
Time for some downvotes!
---
I hate going against spirit, she's terrifyingly hard to beat, especially without iron will, she can bump into me, she can move at high speeds, she can mindgame. These are all are aspects of a powerful killer, overpowered? No.
---
Her base kit I find to be perfectly fine, and I'm talking about spirits in the rank 1's. Her add ons are what breaks her for me. Mother daughter ring, prayer beads, power speed, haunting reappearance duration are all what makes her mess you up, but people don't realize this because they go against a spirit, lose, then go complain without looking at what exactly makes her strong. 
---
Despite popular belief she can be countered, she relies on sounds and scratch marks, amplified by stridor, so how do you counter a killer that relies on senses? Mess with her senses. We have the power to trick her into thinking were doing one thing, and doing something else, we always have a big tell tell that she's phasing, we have perks to counter her ability to hear as easily, and perks to know she's coming.
---
Some of the nerfs suggested makes her ability almost benign, for instance "remove breathing and grunts of pain whilst phasing" so a survivor merely has to stand still in order to get away. "Remove the ability to cause collision in phase" personally I don't understand why she has collision, but a simple move 3m from the side of a loop will counter that tactic. "Make her grunts of pain omnidirectional" much better than being deaf and I can see it being a much better change provided they fix sounds.
---
In essence I feel it's her add ons, that are the issue, even at rank 1 the only time survivors really struggled against spirit is when her add ons were decent, against no add ons spirit she can still be dominated, the call for nerfs comes across as a excuse to not get better vs her, and stray away from the tactic of running around a pallet for 10 minutes vs any other killer. My ten cents, I feel like this will be downvoted because you're not allowed an opinion in this sub unless it's the "right" opinion, but I could care less. Nerf spirit and it will just be fuel to nerf the next killer survivors are constantly going against because they nerfed the last strong killer.

+200 Killer Stunned
---
- Perks: I run Ruin, Enduring, BBQ and NOED (red) or Pop (anything but red). 
---
- Use the saw to travel. Take wide angles on turns so you don’t have to stop. 
---
- Limit use of the saw in chases, especially if you aren’t great with it yet/aren’t using any good add-ons. You’ll waste more time than you save, honestly. Use it if you find yourself getting looped to break the pallet. If you’re running good add-ons that allow you to nearly insta-saw, you can get creative with it in chases. 
---
- Tuning guide and the non-purple moonshine are the best add-ons, followed by the primer bulb. Anything to reduce cooldown/charging speed (although, extra steering is fun too). 
---
- As with most killers, don’t respect pallets. Enduring helps.

I've changed some things, give it another try, it's still op
---
Regression is the name of the game at higher ranks. Generators will FLY by, and your only option most of the time is to stop it before it even happens (which is why Ruin is huge). Pop lets you *reverse* so much more progress and delays survivors by a lot of time. Kicking a generator at 80-90% completion is a HUGE blow to the survivors (even moreso if you have Ruin and it’s still up) because you cost them so much more time than a normal generator kick could. It also helps that it’s instant, meaning as soon as you kick it you know at the least how much it’s going to regress even if they start working on it as soon as you leave.
---
I think it’s just because the majority of people started watching Tru3 and he disappointed everyone with how toxic he is and how narcissistic he is, I just found out like a couple days ago he has a cosmetic in the game and since the beginning I’m sure the devs liked him and didn’t mind him but now it’s not a mystery why behavior doesn’t even acknowledge his tweets or him putting the devs down all the time, or putting down people that give him money for his builds.  Devs aren’t perfect but he’s ridiculous even made a tweet for his fanbase to try and get downvoted because they like him and he was salty people don’t like him.

---
&gt;BHVR has repeatedly failed to deliver on promises and basic expectations in the three years I have played this game. I love them and the game to death but I often question decisions and their ability. I also understand there is leeway with them being a much smaller company then Ubi, EA, Activision, CDPR, and so on. But with this being their flagship game, the amount of broken promises (and patches) is inexcusable at this point. This is a three year old game that announced they’d be getting dedicated servers at E3, had that delayed, cancelled events to work on said servers, delayed the servers, and now can’t even deliver on arguably the best (RESKINNED) holiday event for the game, and happens on the same day every year.
---
&gt;That is insane.
---
&gt;Again, I love this game to bits, and the dev team seem like good people who genuinely want this game to succeed further on. But if they want that, they HAVE to be better. Dead by Daylight still feels like a beta, after three years and tons of DLC.

Ruin has 5% reduction, right? That's only 4 seconds (5 if you count the second of gen work that doesn't make progress after hitting a good) regression assuming a gen is being done at normal speed with just a single survivor and without any speed modifiers. It's not much difference from the 7 seconds shown on the pros and cons list, but I felt it was at least necessary to point out when comparing 2 perks. Ruin is still better usually even then.

Can you elaborate on this? I'm not sure where to look on steam or sfm. Thanks!
---
I love Monto, he replied on one of my yt comments and sounded rude tho 😢.
---
Pillar Men Theme just plays

---
I know I shouldn't. But that made me laugh just a bit.
---
Where is nea?
---
I don't find it scary, just annoying. The only counter-play is to try to just guess if there was a trap placed there a minute ago or not. It'd be way more interesting if you couldn't place them in grass (and could therefore avoid them with good play by looking for them), but trapper was buffed appropriately to compensate. Cause he needs it.
---
Same reason I don't enjoy playing against Hag.
---
Honestly this guy seems like the biggest asshole to work with, he seems to be on some HUGE power trip.. constantly speaks in a condescending manner, and seems to go out of his way to make people awkward on stream.
---
And that's why I like playing Myers.
---
It’s an epidemic of cry babies. DC’ing hurts the game for everyone. Please do not do it. BHVR should remove the “leave game” option and force people to dashboard/desktop to cut down on DCs

MY TOWN JUST CANCELLED TRICK OR TREATING THIS YEAR DUE TO UNFORSEEN CIRCUMSTANCES
---
MY DAUGHTER IS SO UPSET
---
Thank you for this advice, i will get it as soon as it get in the shrine or maybe i will get some dlc when they get in sale, didnt Play much dbd since the Freddy release and back then i mostly Player as survivor
---
It’s not meta because it’s a terrible build if you don’t get an indoor map.
---
Sainso
---
This is my worst fear in dbd

I'm just saying we're all hippocrates in our own ways.

For those still complaining about Bethesdas subscription modell...

You only get one character for 500$ in Star Wars Galaxy Of Heroes

---
Probably, it has so many bugs for a 3 year old game though lol.
---
\*screams in snapped fibula and tibia \*
---
I love the way he said that lmao
---
You have to be kidding. Not trying to be rude but so many of these perks are out of place.
---
Cause that’s toxic
---
All 3 games were different.
---
One game was freddy with Franklin's (they had two keys), ruin, discordance, and pop goes the weasel.
---
The second was clown with pop goes the weasel, noed (I just prestiged He was level 18), caulrophobia, and ruin.
---
The third was legion cause I got tired of people hiding with sloppy butcher, ruin, bbq and chili, and that plague perk I forget the name of that turns off 3 generators.
---
The only perk I really think could have helped was iron maiden, but it's so damn situational I dont take it. Tracking perks are only good if their conditions are met. It's hard to meet conditions when they dont do anything but jump between lockers in the corner of the map.
---
It's also worth noting I got merciless in all 3, the games just took a really long time.
---
Battle Passes suck because they offer skins which, once the Pass is over, you can never get again. They're really, really fucking lame.
---
Being greedy on billy is going for an M1 instead of waiting a little longer for another chainsaw
---
Yes, it can be quite good, especially if you play with friends.
---
*hypocrites and no we all aren't
---
Eh it's his opinion. There's no right answer for most as it depends on play style
---
I’d rather have a battle pass and unlock stuff as I play than buy premium currency for stuff personally.
---
Blue Japanese woman with nothing except bandages fucked by fat man with another persons face
---
Okay, so, I play this game a lot because it's pretty much the only video game I play and it's one of my hobbies. I have tons of totem spawns memorized. Probably almost all of them.
---
Many, many, many more people are not as devoted to this game as people like you or me and suggesting they just memorize totem spawns is not helpful.
---
Also, as far as the new spawns they are implementing go, memorizing them is not a simple task; not even a moderately difficult task. It is pretty dang difficult to learn the spawns on the 4 new Badham maps and Hawkins Lab. Even using Small Game I have trouble actually finding the totems when it goes off on Hawkins. 
---
If they go forth with implementing this strength in all maps it will be a problem.
---
I wish they would do this for ruin and kindred and just make kindred a mechanic. The amount of times I’ve used it to see my teammates literally crouched in corners while I’m on hook for 3 minutes is disheartening. I can’t imagine what they are thinking if they can’t see each other.
---
Pop is always Viable, Dark Devotion is for fun. Like being T3 Myers with no Terror Radius fun.
---
I bet that’s not the only head someone’s came in, cover up the fun bags
---
You’re too slow to chase survivors so you pretty much need to constantly be sneaking up to them, which is very hard against good survivors on an open map.  The main strength of the build (stealth) is too easily countered on open maps.
---
True...
---
It sounds good on paper it just has too many drawbacks compared to the other slowdown perks. While bamboozle helps so many killers who have no way to deal with certain loops
---
What are some that are out of place?
---
Rank reset happened over a week ago......
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES MATT POST STUPID FUCKING JOKES TO TWITTER. WE DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR GOD DAMN JOKES, WE CARE ABOUT THE FUCKING EVENT.
---
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about

Yep

Silent Hill 2 Final Boss
---
used by pussies only lol
---
yeah how dare you complain for a update being reals ed on time bugged their just humans who make mistakes uwu
---
Dedicated servers do not have a killer host, so your lobby is still waiting for members :)
---
WHY THE FUCK IS NANCY’S P2 JUST NORMAL PANTS WITH A FEW RED LINES? 
---
I WASTED ALL THAT BP!
---
Yeah i know, but ranks take some time to revert back to normal
---
Usually if you go for stuff you want, which idk why who’s wouldn’t, it gets you to around level 35-38. Takes about another 600k give or take to get to level 50.
---
There *was* a power outage. That is confirmed. I don't understand why people say they lied about it. People from the area in Canada have confirmed this and you can just literally google it as well. Plus they are French Canadians, meaning they are not native English speakers so they can't be expected to communicate too well.
---
That would be so good. Imagine being chased by Jason, Michael and Harry at the same time.
---
I don't have an issue with what BHVR is doing, however i think now that we have paid for cosmetics, dlc, and the rift thing coming up, they should make the base game free. It could be an awesome boost to the player base and might even be more profitable at this point.
---
People would still leave but the in game DC option allows Behavior to be able to tell the difference between a player experiencing a power outage vs. purposely leaving the game. Then, DCers can be penalized properly.
---
Mettle of man is worse then meh
---
thats shows how easy it is to find the hex, if you wouldnt have found it she would have, if she wouldnt then he would have.
---
Good concept that might help a little, but On PS4 you can hit the PS button, then options and close the App or just pull that cord if your hard wired and “POOF” your gone and back to the main loading screen.
---
Removing a option isn’t gonna help much BhVR needs to quit with babying everyone and lay down the law. But they have to also fix the game first in order to do that since so many people are still getting randomly kicked for no reason. I got booted from my killer game the other day, 3 dead and just found the 4th and then booted!
---
Yo Evan and LF looking more like monsters than Demogorgon lol
---
What are survivors suppose to do then? Not do gens? You dont have to tunnel one person or camp someones hook but survivors need to do gens to win the game.
---
Pupper's as Meg is my favorite
---
That´s wrong, you do adquire stacks with frenzy. Legion is still dogshit, but this is one of their best perks.
---
What if I told you more people/money in the bug fixing department is not gonna fix bugs faster. They already have people working on it to the best of their ability. Hiring more cooks for your kitchen to make the soup is just gonna make the soup taste bad. As to whether the cooks BHVR has right now are competent or not, who knows. BHVR seems satisfied enough with their performance.
---
And obviously the patch will still have bugs. Every patch does. Every patch of every game has bugs. It just so happens that whatever bug they found with 3.3.0 was major enough to prevent deployment of the patch. Shit happens. 
---
DBD's REAL problem was that it was originally made by a small dev team who didn't think their game would last this long OR blow up like it did. It was coded with the finest "small indie company" spaghetti money could buy, and now they're suffering for it. The ideal situation would be to create DBD 2 but they're so neck deep in licenses at this point that there's no way that'll happen. They've mentioned in the past that they're working on untangling their spaghetti and we just have to hope they don't take much longer with it.
---
Well, you are playing some of the more disliked killers. A certain amount of bullshittery is to be expected.
---
everyone should be like monto 
---
annoying
---
I was a rank 4 killer before rank reset. I only won if I ran an ebony mori or tunneled as a good killer like freddy or spirit.
---
Pig nerfed until she's under the ground.
---
Killers have to run around swinging a knife.  That's it.
---
See?  Easy to trivialize anything.
---
Your comment is so absurd it doesn't merit a real response.
---
That ^
---
It’s not meta because it’s completely a gimmick build. If you want a build that’s similar to this but actually very good and reliable, Ghostface with Chewed Pen and Address Book is great. 
---
I do not disagree that it’s super fun though, I love the build. But it’s goofy and unreliable lol.
---
On PS4 at least, a killer can DC right as you’re leaving the exit gates and you still lose your item, offering, and whatever bloodpoints you would have gotten for escaping...
---
I mean... it's not like this is the only time BHVR has had issues that affected the game negatively... It's kind of understandable for people to be upset with them.
---
I dont think ill ever get to purple ranks and red ranks ever
---
This meme came to mind verbatim when I looked at another post about stalking lol
---
I main Killer because I want to murder toxic survivor mains to force them to uninstall dbd.
---
It’s completely possible. You act like WiFi can’t cut out at random times or if something may have unplugged. Sure, under these circumstances it may seem sketchy like he left, which could possibly be the case but you’ll truly never know without asking them.
---
Here's what I don't understand about that perk: would it actually be OP if you could proc it once per hook phase? You still only get two uses of it, and if the killer isn't camping it's still as useless as the OG version.
---
Truth. Both Lithe and Balanced Landing are much better options for exhaustion perks than Sprint Burst.
---
Why must you hurt me like this?
---
600k for level 50? Gimme the shit you smoking man.
---
WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO FIND A GAME AS A KILLER
---
It's a replica I bought him.
---
Demogorgon’s a guy? Which means... OH GOD NO
---
Survivor main here. You do you, killer mains. Ivories are ok, and imo so are ebonies, although these last ones as long as they are rare and used so that we all (killer included) can have fun.
---
Your attitude on the other hand, not so much.
---
You don’t get instantly disconnected if your WiFi cuts out. The game would still go on for at least a few seconds with the killer standing still. Also in these types of games I always assume the worst cause it probably is. It’s such a rare occurrence for that to happen
---
If you're a noob who's too stupid to learn anything new, heck yeah it is! Three cheers for noobs!
---
Yes.
---
I used to be a really good survivor. Like coming in the red ranks withing the first 2 days after reset. (I stopped playing and am around rank 16 now i guess) 
---
Anyways i tried to be a fair player and not toxic. (Meta perks but fun builds. Like getting good stuff out of chests with ace in the hole and plunderer or being hodini with lithe dance with me quick and quiet)
---
Anyways if im free but im dead on the next hook and you are struggling but i found the hatch im gonna wait till you sacrificed yourself. Usually when there are only 2 left there arent any more pallets we can use and we wont be able to do 2 gens without the killer noticing us. 
---
But in the end i dont really care for bloodpoints anymore. I have my main on prestige 3 almost every perks and just play for fun.
---
It sucks when the killers chasing you you found the hatch but the last survivor wont die already
---
10/10 would buy. Soak it up, bitches.
---
Agreed. It still is good on others but amazing on them.
---
Also talked about it on stream
---
When barb is added to the game
---
"Dwight! Hide in the locker!"
---
... 
---
"Dwight, the killer is IN the locker!
---
True and sometimes you make it out with items and blood points and sometimes nothing
---
Well judging from the downvotes a bunch of people don't agree with us ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
But I like your positive attitude!
---
Me and the boys about to NOED some Claudettes
---
&gt;probably she wasn’t even vaulting on her side tbh
---
Super incorrect ^
---
Then you haven't gone up against decent spirits man, they are scary as fuck. If you don't have Iron Will or they have Stridor, you are dead.
---
Thats how I felt last night. Was trying to have a fun game but there were high ranking survivors against me a lvl 18 killer.
---
Im a spirit with stridor .-.
---
I get that rank 1 survs probably have no trouble with it, but I absolutely hate playing against a killer that can see your aura if you look at him the wrong way....
---
Could be useful on stealth killers or new players who aren't sure how the game works yet. But in general, yeah, not sure it'd be that useful.
---
Nicely done man
---
I love it but replace Frank with Joey and its perfect
---
Everyone knew. It was mind boggling how it ever made it into the game at all.
---
From what region?
---
Alert is definitely a very good perk! I just don't believe it should be in the top tier, especially when you have Dark Sense 2 tiers below it, as they're very similar.
---
Also this Tier list is totally fine for people learning the game. Just if you don't specify so, people will assume you have played a lot more than you actually have (like I did) and grade your tier list from a higher rank perspective.
---
Last bit on self care: Totally valid point, and at newer ranks it's definitely an option, it's just usually when people self care that's time not spent working on generators which are the main objective. Also, there's a stigma about players sitting in corners self-caring when the team needs them to be helping escape
---
It wasnt all 4 each time, it was two both times.
---
Honestly id be fine with simple emblem reduction for jumping between too many closets without doing anything. If killers lose points for camping, I dont see a problem with taking from survivors who also in one spot.
---
Rule #31 of Dead By Daylight: Whenever you are in a tight spot, a Bill shall magically materialize within 16m.
---
*pornhub intro plays*
---
And I believe the zero-gennys fixed win should be an achievement instead of a playstyle. But it's not even hard to do and it's a waste of time, offerings and items.
---
I mean Killers have perks, add-ons and offerings designed to cut the game in half. It's the only type of payback survivors really can do is waste your time to.
---
Maybe that is what you encountered.
---
If I had the talent I'd have already made a One Punch Man "Found you" meme, too.
---
“WELCOME TO DEAD BY DAYLIGHT”
---
I play Pig, Clown, Huntress Billy and Shape pretty often, but Huntress and Clown are my mains.
---
OMG WTF. The luck tho xD
---
[Enjoy.](https://youtu.be/Vn1Znvdifx8)
---
We already have them, but we see them as meg players.
---
Who’s downvoting? Lol
---
Ok?
---
That’s just panic. At Rank 4, sometimes I’ll do it if the Killer completely catches me off guard, like Ghostface/Pig/Myers/Wraith.
---
If I’m 100% focused on a Gen and get smacked, you can guarantee I’m about to pull a 180 and smack headfirst into that obvious pile of tires.
---
What its bugged again? When DBD was new on console you had to heal a hundred times in ONE match to get the trophy. I was very lucky to have a nice Wraith
---
Facing Plague seems like a be dammed if you do be dammed if you dont situation
---
You never seen Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness or Ash vs Evil Dead?
---
No matter what I run though the game isnt being held hostage. This is an entirely different issue.
---
Remember when they widened the basement so killers couldnt hold the game hostage? How is this different?
---
I mean I can still hear survivors breathing and things like that simply because after walking around for so long with him I end up tuning his steps out. If I pick up something that doesn’t sound like his stomp then I check it out. Might just be an attention thing
---
With an insane giggle and an army of fakes as well.
---
*Hee, he heeeee!!*
---
Why was Spine Chill not working?
---
Then how can you say you'd rather go against 4 spirits than a Billy? Billy can get looped and Spirit can't.
---
CAN SOMEONE FUCKING FIX THAT ANNOYING ASS GHOSTFACE TRU3TA1ENT BUILD ITS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE TO GO AGAINST ESPECIALLY ON MAPS WITH LOW LOS AND THEY ALWAYS BRING A FUCKING JIGSAW PIECE TO HELP WITH THEIR ALREADY BUSTED FUCKING BUILD

I love it!!!!

If they changed Surge to regress all generators, I'd couple it with Surveillance so I can finally ditch BBQ lol
---
Well use cntrl+S next time silly devs
---
**Spirit Fury + Enduring time**
---
I'm just trying to have a fun game with legion and getting pallets dropped on me left and right by a nea with dead hard. Then I switched to survivor and there was a blendette that I rescued twice from the hook decides to trigger the hag's trap as I'm working on the gen. I get it finish but get hooked. This butthead has the audacity to but dance the hag and escape and leaves me to die
---
They better not
---
I agree truffle
---
Rip party streamers

Also, here’s the video link. It’s a bit lengthy, but I can’t stress how much it helped 
---

---
Why'd u have to call me out like this man...
---
If that's true that's fucked up, and yeah he does complain ALOT I mostly just watch him so I can learn how to play. I definitely see him judging people's builds and he gets pissed and sarcastic when he gets a no mither build. I understand the no mither builds but still you're being given money atleast act like you're grateful.
---
Jumping on the Bethesda hate train?
---
SWF, two OoO, i know im not red rank but this made my day lol
---
I mean even in Halloween it depends on which timeline your going with.
---
1-2, Water and latest timelines he’s a psycho that can take punishment.
---
Thorn? Supernatural.
---
Can’t remember anything about Rob Zombies though.
---
I seen rank rank 1 killers who dont tunnel or camp, point is you can win without it and it makes the game more enjoyable but if survivors do not do generators they wont win
---
It's not hard to get these.
---
I agree that they need to do more about it but this feature is what is needed for them to track it.
---
Well yeah but a lot of survivors don't sit around for the match to finish unless they're grouped up. So it's probably a biased observation.
---
Please credit the original artist for this.
---
I'm not sure who this is, but taking work without credit is shitty.
---
You can get around the killer now, they cant just sit in the middle to block everyone in the basement now.
---
It's a bit different if the killer directly walks into you.
---
You know, it's too damn much work to be upset about video game shit IMO. I just don't have room for it! I love this game, I love Halloween, I love Halloween events in games I love, and I'm happy with whatever we get whenever! It feels a lot better to be positive than negative :3 Happy Halloween, friend!

Exactly he’s doing something most people dream of at least be grateful, but yeah it happened several months ago.
---
No, they don’t. Ruin already destroys bad survivors, I played games for the first time after rank reset and when I get yellow rank teammates and there’s Ruin the game is basically already over, they can’t hit skill checks for shit. Put that with the shit matchmaking system and bad survivors can get into red ranks, so then I’m stuck with 3 teammates who can barely do 5 gens w Ruin as is. Adding more time would make the killer have even more of an easy win. Then I’d go to SwF more to have people with actual brains, and then SwFs become a bigger deal. Just no. If rank was actually a testament of skill and I could know all my tm8s had brains, sure, but not now
---
Chihuahua Machu pichu!

This sounds like programming in a nutshell.

It is so good, I hope he actually does more!
---
whats the point of this comment exactly?
---
Nope, I know for a fact that it's when Joel has been injured, it's now winter, Ellie has a bow and kills a bunny then you play as her.
---
Pallet stuns on nurses are always the best
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple disconnected players (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Yeah, there’s nothing worse than trying to counter a decent killer while two of your teammates gust sit on their thumbs the whole match.
---
But survivors are usually penalized by crows if they remain still for too long, without activity or in the same area
---
They are ridiculously common for both of them.
---
SAME REASON AS POSTED, THEY DONT WANNA UPSET THE APPLE CART EVEN MORE WITH PUTTING A TIME FRAME PERIOD AND THEN FAIL AGAIN AND LOOK EVEN MORE INCOMPETENT. 
---
LOOK AT DEDICATED SERVERS, THEY KEPT SAYING “END OF SUMMER” “END OF SUMMER” [NOT_QUEEN] “END OF SUMMER IS SEPTEMBER 23RD GUYS” THAT TIME CAME AND PASSED. NO SERVERS. 
---
THEN CAME OUT SAYING MID TO LATE FALL, BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT WONT HAPPEN EITHER AND WILL BE MORE LIKE NEXT YEAR!! GRANIT PC HAS DEDICATED SERVERS BUT IS A SHIT SHOW.
---
I do not do the artwork, the real artist is [here](https://twitter.com/klarschon)

I’d watch
---
Then we’ll need Ghostface hanging around in between them.
---
It would be the ghost killer group ;)
---
Doesn't matter. It comes up far too common.
---
Edit: often
---
I am a Myers main and I have a lot of them they are not hard to get lol
---
Me and the boys at three am finding the beans
---
Nice. Ive never played clown and i personally think i dont like the playstyle
---
They added more time after a hook to use it, and that makes a lot of difference to the quality of the perk. There’s no other way for a killer to dramatically lower a gen’s progression that quickly. I’ve had entire games saved by PgtW.
---

« Jazz music Stops »

I was playing solos and there was a two man swf (Claud and Nancy) in the lobby. ghostface hooks me (doesn’t camp) and eventually starts chasing the Claud who runs directly to the hook and tries to get me...she fails obviously and then big brain Nancy unhooks me right in front of him too. she’s already injured and I’m running right in front of her w ghostface on our tails so I just yeet that pallet right down on that bitch’s head and gf does his thing
---
Sigh I mean I guess... 
---
I'm just a little teensy bit annoyed by the killer bitching when i finally play around rank 4 and its constant bubba camping, Michael mori, and ghostface stalk camping hooks
---
I guess the plague speaks. Albeit in a babylonian language
---
Yup, dead hard in theory just flat out removes your hit box, so traps can’t hurt you
---
Damn...that's deep!
---
I agree there shouldn’t be one. Vacuums of any kind should be removed. There’s still the vacuum of a survivor running through a pallet and then sucking them back to the pallet. I use it all the time but it really should be in the game.
---
“who’s the obsession?” “nobody” “so there isn’t one?” “no it’s nobody atall” “okay...so there’s no obsession this round right?”

Try alt f4ing in a game, doesn’t work. You have to go to task manager my guy.

I also love me some horror movies, and am kinda obsessed with DbD. :)

They aren't that great, I've tried about 5 hair and tombstone add on combos, unless it's a bunch of actually new people you won't even hit EW3 until gen 4 or 5, unless I just suck ass which is a total possibility

Did you not read my comment?
---
Was in a party and one of them didn’t know how to mend from legion and the other didn’t know what ruin was called...I left shortly after
---
I think you just photographed the moment she steps out of the shadow realm because she no longer hears the killer
---
Rework Ruin, add a secondary objective.
---
Fuel - To begin repairs on a generator, obtain a fuel canister from a shed that spawns primarily in the middle of the map. It doesn't replace your held item (you have two hands) but does slow you down by 5%. 
---
M1 to fill the generator with fuel. A maximum of 3 fuel canisters can be loaded on a generator with each fueling supplying 25 seconds of generator run time. Before the first 20% of generator progress is completed, the generator only consumes 0.5 fuel per second.
---
Generators are unable to progress or regress without fuel.
---
Most have a tendency to not just stand there and politely let people pass, you know? :p
---
Oh god, please no. At least as a toggle. Computer has way better handling and it would suck to play as killer against survivors on computer and suck to play survivors against Huntress/Nurse.

I get a Tombstone Piece more or less every bloodweb and they are far better than Judiths.

It’s totally circumstantial to me.
---
Sometimes I’ve had to vent to Killers about BS hits, lag, or latency issues in the game. Half the time they don’t even know what I’m talking about, since on their screen it looked fine, but sometimes it just annoys the hell out of you.
---
I haven’t raged/trash talked a Killer directly in a long time, but you know damn well he’s gonna hear about me being salty about getting hit 4ft across a Pallet and being downed. 
---
The game is a lot better when you just come to terms that sometimes you *will be outplayed.* Not every game is going to be an Escape/4K, and if you aren’t enjoying the game itself and only have fun winning/escaping, you should probably take a little break.
---
Dude, how ducking high are you right now?  This shitpost is fowl!
---
IM NEW TO THIS GAME BUT SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO GET RANK 10 ON KILLER, ONE GAME ALL THE PLAYERS RUN INTO ME, NEXT GAME EVERYONE IS LOOPING LIKE THEY'RE RANK 1, WHAT IS THIS BULLSHIT?
---
Only works once though lol
---
Nah dude, we're supposed to put ourselves on the hooks for them so they get ez kills.
---
So removed 2 gens, 160 seconds of gen time, and add 4 mini objectives that takes 60s objectively, that cant be regressed?
---
Am i reading this wrong?

Your last statement about being a killer main and not playing survivor barely at all makes your response make more sense now.  I would have known this alone by your first statement where you have absolutely no clue how slow a Self Care into Sloppy and Thanatophobia is.  Insane amount of time wasted.  It throws the game Self Caring into that.  Killers run that combo of perks to get survivors to do that very thing.
---
"If she died it would have been a 3v1"
---
You don't understand the game quite literally was a 3v1.  She spent 5 minutes between 5 self Cares healing while we did all the gens.  My friend and I died giving her those gens.
---
Yes Self Care can be done anywhere but 9 times out of 10 it simply isn't.  Players that run it typically play scared and insist on moving to a spot of the map they feel hidden and safe in.  This time is factored into their heal.  Again you do not stop doing everything just to look for a teamate to heal you...be productive repair a gen eventually you naturally run into a teamate who can then heal you.  This argument is flawed logic.
---
Lol!  Oh my God you were happy for her and I'm toxic?  You have no idea how that game went down dude.  Let me explain it to you so you can understand the frustration we have against Self Care Gamers. She didn't "run the killer period"!  She didn't "escape the killer period".  It was an optimal Sloppy Than Wraith who played to protect his gens by inflicting damage and literally abandoning chase immediately afterwards.  She didn't run him a single time because A. She was dogshit we watched her waste pallets and B. Because he played a very optimal hit and run tactic game to pressure the gens.  He was only hitting her to get that idiot out of the game for a minute each time to bait her into healing.  It got to the point where the only 3 players attempting gen repairs were me my friend and the random who luckily had some balls and knew if we didn't plug away at repairs injured we were ALL dead
---
 That useless waste of space got carried through the entire game.  
---
I just explained how that game went down and why she was a complete non factor throughout it against an intelligent optimal killer that got her to play right into his loadout strat.  Do you understand now why Self Care is a terrible perk on players like that at red ranks?  I can't explain it any better than that.
---
Ooh fancy! Good job my dude.
---
Well,yeah it was, but its been postponed for a week or so

its been delayed. its all over their social media and this sub

Don’t forget Tenacity so you can worm away from any hook while recovering
---
Yeah, paranoia is great, but have you ever tried placing a trap in an area that isn't ACTUALLY too narrow to run around and watch someone waste their Dead Hard on it?
---
But no matter how hard you try you csnt block them all.
---
good thing i said short walls and not T-walls
---
I'm 99% sure that was me
---
The perk itself isn't directly being changed IRC. With the Mid-Chapter patch, all of the Stealth killers will get the Undetectable status while using their abilities (Wraith while cloaked, Pig while crouched, Ghost Face in Shroud and Shape in EW 1), meaning their aura can't be revealed.
---
what can i say? I agree and can confirm every single word you said
---
You can get around that by switching closets or taking a short stroll.
---
By the way, the reason max killer sens is so low is because it changes the curve on billy.... by... soo... sooo..... SO much.
---
Sometimes it's dumb though, no dont tbag in front of the pallet dumbass I'm just gonna tier 3 off you
---
if you know how to hold it and use it when you have to, sprint burst can be used to make some great plays. i remember one time i had to unhook my teammates in the basement, so i 99'd my sprint burst, and activated it after i unhooked them. i came dashing ahead right in front of the killer and that was enough to get his attention and let my hooked teammate get away and heal
---
Dude, a lot of people would LOVE launch DbD. Imagine just never losing (if you're a Survivor Main).
---
I don't care what the Twilight Zone episode said, that'd take MONTHS to upset most people in this community.
---
When you're the only bottom at the orgy
---
HAHAHAHAHA wow this if my first time seeing a meme that shows survivors complaining about OP killer add-ons. Please stop making memes like this all this sub is right now is killers complaining about toxic survivors. These memes would be fine if they weren't always being posted. Sorry if I want a little variation for once and a while.
---
Hex implies you can make it stop.
---
Its probably bannable but realistically nobody is gonna report an afk killer.
---
Did you actually just say adrenaline needs a buff (I’m a survivor main)
---
He did a great job!!
---
It's always the Bill players
---
Yeah, he's...probably the worst person for the team. At the absolute least, he's convinced me to NEVER spend more money on DbD with his PR skills.
---
Idk man, but when I play rank 20 myers I don’t think anyone knows how his power works, because survivors come up to me thinking I’m friendly and start teabagging
---
I think they need to make perks different depending on rank
---
Memed wIth me
---
It seems like a "Git gud" kind of situation. I just need to play him more and get more experience. I'm spoiled by quiet killers lol
---
this is the legendary rank 30 huntress...also you could’ve lived if your teammates actually did gens big oof
---
Is there a 1920 x 1080 of this
---
Pretty much, minor edit there, 5 skill checks per gen, can I rob those people's luck? I get so fucking many skillchecks, it's practically like the game is saying "Fuck you, go find the totem."
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Makes it less annoying when a Killer decides to lobby-dodge your SWF Group
---
It can sense you're looking for it.
---
I reinstalled TF2 to go get Halloween cosmetics there. That'll lure it out.
---
Insidious exists and it's okay to do meme builds from time to time. But if that's your go to build, then it's just ridiculous.
---
wtf is a “short wall” I’m having a brain fart or something
---
That sounds interesting but I feel like that would be tough to implement into the game
---
Rude people need love too.
---
Just run both
---
Even if killers predict dead hard it’s still incredibly useful for getting enough distance for one or two more loops, which can save you just as much time as sprint burst does depending on the killer. High rank players believe its powerful because it’s the only exhaustion perk that’s really useful against Nurse and Spirit.
---
That being said, I run sprint burst almost all the time and I agree that it’s one of the best ones.
---
I’ve been reported for being an afk wraith lol
---
I think I heard awhile ago they were working on ways to change/get rid of the rank system

What's wrong with it this time?

Exactly. It adds skill to the perk, which every perk, *cough cough NOED Spirit Fury, Adren, Dead Hard for distance* needs.

Lightweight, in some situations it can help the Killer find you easily in close-quarters/chases.

Teachables are annoying that way, so at max you should only have one teachable per character that you really want to ignore cuz trying to handle 2 while also wanting to get more perks for that character is very annoying.

Mad grit aint that bad, but is not really much useful unless you are aiming for a basement build

i am so far gone it doesnt really touch me now, i know that and i just am as i am, got used to that
---
Selfish care is far from a good perk. When I play killer, I love seeing people with selfish care as I only have to hit them once and they are unable to do gens, unhook teammates or do anything productive for 32 seconds. They even let their teammates die on the hook, so they can finish their selfish care. It's amazing.

Usually more than one. Why go to the basement alone
---
Because? You're not? Playing? THE GAME??
---
Why would anyone have fun holding m1 for 5 minutes straight?
---
Also just because its rank 20 doesn't mean its okay. Imagine you just picked up the game, are eager to play, and you get into a game where you do gens for 5 minutes and leave, while the killer stands still and doesnt contribute properly to your experience as a survivor.
---
Rank 20's are new players trying to get into DBD, afk killers like that will only drive them away, and wont help them get better.
---
I've literally never heard anyone other than my grandfather and now myself say this.
---
Holy shit that was you. I didn’t think that could have been any higher than rank 15 because you didn’t have any perks on, the Hag didn’t teleport to any of her traps, and she randomly attacked an inanimate object halfway through.
---
Some Killers get really salty if you genuinely outplay them. Blind them because they're too stupid to look at a wall or pallet stun them when they pick someone up under an obvious pallet and suddenly "TOXIC SURVIVOR DETECTED: ENGAGE TUNNEL. I REPEAT: SURVIVOR TRYING TO SURVIVE DETECTED."
---
I stopped playing swf since I managed to get rank 1 binding all actions and movement to the side of my mouse in swf
---
Well normally most people don't have a big problem with a killer being afk (it's shitty but it's a free win, free points so meh kinda thing) but if you're just standing around invisible giving them no real way to get any sort of boldness, chase etc you're full on sprinting over the the shit line.
---
fortunately for me, I don’t have to worry about that due to not being good enough at either role to outplay anyone
---
Damn turning spirit mains into a cosme- oh wait that's removing spirit's brain not heart my bad.
---
Your right i mean if i wanted to id just pull down a plank thats right next to a gen and run alert
---
I know I was as baffled as you are. I have no perks cause I was doing a feng min ritual and I never played feng so I just loaded up without even a first perk. Didn’t imagine to steamroll that hag I was baffled a the killer rank
---
I FUCKING HATE WHEN PEOPLE SHIT ON ME FOR TRYING TO GET BETTER AT CERTAIN KILLERS AND TEABAGGING AND CONTINUOUSLY TRYING TO FLASHLIGHT ME JUST TO BM ME
---
What I'm saying is it takes most killers a 4 slug 2 win in red ranks, and when they're super desperate they slug the 3rd guy to prevent an escape keeping me hostage for 5 or 10 minutes after losing a game.
---
also why isnt nea there? and why is the trapper their? could of sworn he became a survivor
---
Leather face the way he’s drawn (I love it all btw no hate) makes he look like he seems really angry but is just really nice
---
no offense but your list sucks
---
Now every serial killer in a 10 mile radius is going to tunnel him
---
I think this is kind of unfair for multiple reasons. First of all, the devs should have announced this earlier instead of doing that on the day that the event was supposed to happen. And two, if this happened once, then that is a different story. But DBD is always bugged. There are always issues and bugs etc.

‘Member when survivors could fully destroy every hook on the map with no respawn? I ‘Member
---
doing gens, u?
---
Pigs still better than 1/3 of the killers
---
...But that's what 80% of players do. Lets say hypothetically a killer chased 1 person all game.. the likelihood of any of them hanging around to get even a small amount of chase is extremely slim. The majority of players quite literally just do gens.. and leave, unless they are forced not to (by being chased.)
---
Survivors could pull off full map sabo and hooks never came back. Then they’d be toxic if you let them bleed out.
---
I can't tell if you're mocking me or not, but I find the comment funny regardless (once my blond self registered the humor).
---
Or don’t waste pallets?
---
Just run spine chill and pay attention to your surroundings. When it’s triggered don’t just sprint in a random direction.
---
You have time, take a look in every direction and try to hide behind something that’s a decent distance away from the generator.
---
And also don’t do this if it just blinks at you. You have enough time from a steady trigger to find a good hiding spot. I can’t say I’ve ever run directly into a killer while using spine chill.
---
Depends on the play style you want, 
---
If you want to use your portals for surveillance rather then travel,  use the Sticky Lining + Thorny Vines. 
---
If you want NOBODY to take down your portals use Thorny Vines + Viscous Webbing/Upside Down Resin.
---
Or if you want to be really quick with your portals (Travelling and recovery) try Deer Lung/Unknown Egg + Barb’s Glasses/ Eleven’s Soda.
---
She tried her best
---
Im confused, where was the toxic part of it?
---
why did you put Spark of Madness as a must buy? doctor is one of the weakest killers, and while i personally enjoy him i dont think everyone does. as far as perks the only really good perk out of all 6 is monitor, and even that isnt necessary for any build, its just a nice thing to have

I'm playing the dbd game where survivor leaves match. No generators have been done, and all killer is doing is slugging playing super sweaty. Like every bad game where somebody leaves that tend to happen. Not just that. When everyone dies the 3rd guy is just slugged prolonging a lost match for 10 to 15 minutes longer, because some sweaty killer desperately needs the 4k rather then starting the end game collapse by closi hmm g hatch, and ultimately destroying the guy at gates (since they always spawn next to each other regardless) 
---
There's definitely counter plays, but if you're not in a SWF with mics, you're screwed. Counterplay usually involves being super optimized when in reality most people are just doing solo Q
---
Yeah I always took it as a genderless thing too. Otherwise we'd... uh... see something.
---
r/discussions doh
---
im so confused
---
Probably should have added; you have to fix the fuse box before the killer destroys the cable again.
---
This is sooo nice , I want to put it in my screen background on my desk top

Yeah, I had no other ideas, just wanted to make it more interactive and less boring.
---
DEVS HATE THE EDGY GANG AS MUCH AS THEY HATE THE OINKER

oh im sorry, i thought this was a sub where you could post anything dbd related? or am i wrong?

By your perks and their playstyle they must be in the 18 to 16 ranks. If not holt shit they boosted

That would be the best thing they could do for this game
---
^(bing)
---
No wonder he's so angry and stabby. He can't have any carnival fun.
---
yeah and players like me would abuse  them super hard. secondly it would deter from main game and take players away and make regular game timer painfully long at higher ranks. sometimes killers are already waiting 30 minutes to an hour at rank 1

No, Frank is the leader and has the same mask as Julie, Joey is the alt-male mask and the one with the skull.

If i was gonna rework Second Wind I'd have it the perk starts activated.  And can be re activated by healing another survivor 1 health state. (including unhooks mby)

That way even if you get caught first it still has some use.   Cos deliverance has the same problem.

Tru3: compliments a survivor for playing optimally, essentially saying they're a good player.

Good survivors on his team but he’s always going against the best. Like I get it man the matchmaking isn’t perfect but it gets old

God if the thing was added I would cream

Oh ya there's definitely some... interesting people. I've dicked around a whole match before just meme'ing having fun with people (not "farming" but according to some people it would be) doing chases downing people letting them get up etc and let all 4 escape and one person said they were reporting me for not playing the game.. (I guess they meant not killing people purposefully).. like.. what?! Kill people too fast.. angry people.. let people survive.. angry people.. stand in a corner.. angry people. There's literally no winning even when you've won.
---
It's going hand in hand with the fact that there are a lot of toxic Ochido fans who run around with clicking flashlights and t-bag, etc, and a lot of the times if you down them fast, they just DC because they are clowns. Blendettes are usually associated with toxicity, as well as Nea (I guess that is subjective though)

Then why respond? You responded to say that you didn't feel like responding. Congratulations on being stupid. Not to mention your response is completely inaccurate.
---
You tried to mock my response by imitating it, but you went about it through massive levels of hyperbole and minimalist effort. I actually listed out the things that survivors have to do, compared them to what killers do, and let the two speak for themselves. 
---
Meanwhile, you just dropped all of the things I listed for killers and said the dumbest shit you could think of, which I'll admit, is impressive given that it involved you thinking, which is no doubt a serious challenge for you. But it still isn't a real argument. Just because you got offended by me calling you less skilled than a killer main doesn't make me wrong. If anything, you getting offended is a statement on how right I am.
---
There's three ways I'd rework Second Wind:
---
1. The perk is just active in general with no requirements. Because honestly not needing to be healed twice isn't that big of a reward. You save at most a minute (if you have to Self Care both times) and at worst about 10 seconds (if someone's running We'll Make It.)
---
2. The heal is considerably faster. About 10 seconds shorter at each rank. This would give the perk more use as an "anti-tunnel" / "looper" perk. (Also if this change was done the perk should also heal through Borrowed Time, or heal you when you're slugged.)
---
3. The perk can be used in general by pressing the Activation key. (Perhaps go in a locker and push E to activate the perk? Or maybe crouch for a few seconds to activate it? That way it doesn't interfere with Diversion.)
---
I was surprised needless to say
---
That IS rude. Sorry to hear that. 
---
Word of advice from someone who used to play games competitively and met a lot of top/famous players from said games; most people at the top are complete and utter dicks with huge egos and *extremely* clique-y with each other. They act nice (read: fake) if you go up to them and ask for pictures, but if you talk to them anywhere else you'll usually see their true colors. If you're not "one of them" or a desperate fan ready to kiss ass, they'll want nothing to do with you.
---
I mean, it's beyond teenagers at this point. It's a 20-somethings thing now.
---
Like what?
---
That kid. Wasn't it someone posting vine videos?
---
Banned for using an in game perk, smart guy.
---
Calling me old?? 😂
---
Meh. Survivors are salty if the killer kills them, survivors are salty if the killer farms, and survivors are salty if the killer literally does nothing, so oh well
---
I'm seriously concerned I had to scroll down this far before I saw literally anyone mention this. Surge is 18% (~14 sec) regression and ruin is 5% + 1 sec of no progress (so as you said, 5 sec total), big difference.
---
Not to mention that at higher ranks where people more consistently hit great skill checks, its actually only 2% because then all you're doing is nullifying the 2% that great skill checks grant.
---
See and I never see Dead Hard like ever and I haven't seen decisive sense it came out. I see WAY more Ruin and BBQ than I do Decisive and Dead Hard.
---
I’m sorry.
---
Ehh that could be read multiple ways. It can be taken as rude, or as an innocent question. We won’t ever truly know
---
They get to think it's a dumb perk, but damn that's shitty of them.
---
It would be like the pre-nerf Enduring.
---
The one that pallets barely stun you and Survivors that Decisive Strike you don't have time to escape so you just quickly turn around and smack them.
---
Oh I know that for a fact, met a few NFL players and they talk out their ass like they're still Pro's. My fav dbd player now is OtzDarva. Explains why he's doing what he's doing and has great prediction. I've never seen him get toxic either.

Been getting downvoted for defending the delay in favor of fixes since they announced it. This sub loves to say we have the worst devs for some reason but I've had too deal with Ubi and EA before, those are horrible devs. 
---
Hell if you want to see devs that don't care about their game anymore look at team fortress 2, last major update was 2017 and their community is the only thing left keeping it alive.
---
Thrilling Tremors is a tracking perk, not a stall perk. If you don’t need the bloodpoints it’s a better version of BBQ imo.
---
Ginger snaps
---
I'm hoping the same for survivors who DC every match, anybody who actually plays killer knows about that.
---
I’d be pissed too if my deliverance gets robbed
---
I think that might be too strong. The reason pop goes the weasel is balanced is because it takes time to actually kick a gen after a hook and sometimes you have to choose between chasing someone and using pop. With surge you eliminate both those factors, AND you can sometimes explode multiple gens if positioned correctly. If you also removed the cooldown it would be a bit too strong I think. Personally I think just making it work with any down instead of just basic attacks would be enough.
---
Yeah, all dc's.

HOLLOWED BLIGHT CANCALLATION

Already found them. Huntress is my favorite it's sad myers is garbage

You don't get to insult people when you derank, I mean honestly. ROFL.
---
Well if you’re using insidious I can only guess what you’re doing. But even I’m smart enough to know camping is fine sure it’s unfun and I will never camp. But with the devs thinking it’s alright means that report button to a alright way of playing does nothing.
---
But it can't REpop gens, so you just have to coordinate enough to either not allow a second down, or not tap any gens that are regressing until after it happens.
---
Its for daddy Myers big chode

---
I didn't try correcting him. I made a mistake thinking furitive chase worked out of a chase. I know exactly how the perk works, just forgot it only works in chase, hence the name.
---
I don't like him because he is so serious about everything. Nothing entertaining from what I've seen. That's why I like HybridPanda.
---
You made a comment telling him he made a mistake that he made in a video over a medium in which tone does not come across well. And then he made an irritated comment in reply. Surprised pikachu
---
Well I know which survivor I'll camp and tunnel next time.
---
Also ironic coming from a survivor who was left behind and unwanted by his coworkers.

I just dislike how it seems that every video where survivors do gens is titled “TOXIC GENRUSHING SURVIVORS GET WHAT THEY DESERVE”

It's hard to tell without context, but they may have a point. There are few things more annoying than teammates who hug gens like their life depends on it when you're getting chased or hooked and actually need their help elsewhere.
---
Every killer has counterplay, just because you can't loop them in a traditional sense, doesn't mean they have no counter play, even pre updated nurse had counter play, it's her add ons that made her bullshit. Plague causes a bit of a dialemma, should I cleanse or not. I find it extremely frustrating that survivors want all killers to be the same and to be able to run the same 4 perks every match with no variation of playstyle.
---
The reasoning is quite simple. 
---
Survivors don’t like having the rest of their game stolen. 
---
It robs them and their team of potential points and makes the game I fun to play. 
---
They can’t have their way, but are expected to just let you have yours. 
---
Mori’s are lame, and pink Mori just needs to be removed altogether.
---
If you go for a mori as soon as possible, such as returning to hook and tunneling the unhooked and moriing them, they will quit, no one will gice you what you havent earned.
---
To mori survivor's you need to wait until theyre more invested into the match, go about hooking people normally and mori someone after a 2nd gen is lost.
---
I dont think most people really care about him at all but it comes down him being biased and whiny. I also think hes really boring to watch personally, hes so serious despite playing the game for years.
---
He gets hate mainly because he talks against toxicity being in the game, and the salty survivors hate that.
---
Half is generous
---
Excuse me why I mori you with the truth tears running down my face.
---
FUCK I forgot they added the skeleton minions back in, I gotta download that shit rn
---
Well, in single player games it won't effect anyone else and in some multiplayer games it won't make a big difference. Plus some people like me just prefer keyboard and mouse. I do think in shooters it can be a bit unfair.
---
Not a fan of having 3 random buttons for gen skills checks and random sizes when doctor exist and we already have perks that make the skill check zone smaller. Sounds way more frustrating than fun.
---
Purchasing Demise of the Faithful is my biggest regret. And that says a lot because:
---
* I'm a Jane Romero main (at least I was before best boy Steve was added)
---
* I bought Freddy back when he was shit after losing a bet with a friend
---
All of Jane's perks are fucking trash. The only perk of any value is Head On and it's so buggy you may as well not bother. Solidarity and Poised are both memes that will work in maybe one out of one hundred games, and there are options that are a zillion times better than them that are available on better characters (Dance With Me, Fixated, Second Wind) or are just free outright. (Lightweight, We'll Make It, Self Care, Botany Knowledge, Adrenaline) Jane's model is huge ~~ha ha funny dummy thicc meme~~, none of her cosmetics really camouflage well except for her red dress on some parts of the cornfields, and while her breathing is relatively quiet her injured noises are the loudest fucking shit in the game to the point that Iron Will is basically mandatory on her.
---
Plague... good lord Plague. My biggest regret in life is purchasing Plague, second only to getting her to Prestige 1 level 50. I don't DC against prayer beads Spirit, 5 blink Nurse, insta-chainsaw Billy, or even basement Bubba but I honestly want to DC whenever I see one of Plague's fucking fountains. Plague as a Killer sucks the fun out of the game for everyone including herself. Playing against her is a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't exercise in attrition where the only real counterplay is "just genrush 4head." I could write my essay on why Plague is easily the worst Killer Behaviour has ever released and is leagues worse than old Freddy and old Legion but that's honestly better reserved to her own thread.
---
As for Plague's perks only one of them has any meta value, and that perk is horrifically overbearing on all the top tier Killers so... the rich get richer? Hooray. Dark Devotion is the biggest meme perk since old Surveillance so let's talk about her other two perks; Corrupt Intervention is the single most overrated perk in the game. "The Survivors can't do gens for 2 minutes it's so much better than Ruin!" Or they could, you know:
---
* Do a totem
---
* Open a chest
---
* Do one of the *other* **five** *fucking gens* that aren't blocked?
---
And the generator block only lasts 2 minutes anyways, which yes is impactful but most of the time won't affect the game much beyond making the Survivors spend ~20 seconds more looking for an unblocked gen. And Corrupt Intervention may as well be named "Anti-Three Gen" because it actively encourages the Survivors *not* to 3 gen themselves.
---
Alright now that I'm done ranting about how Corrupt Intervention sucks ass let's talk about how Infectious Fright is the worst thing to happen to Survivors since Spirit Fury. Let's say you're minding your own business doing a gen and some chucklefuck runs within a country mile of you. Well that's fine I'll just go hide since they're miles away except TOO BAD the Killer has Infectious Fright and suddenly you're revealed with no counterplay beyond "don't get in the Killer's terror radius 4head" and are now being chased as well. Infectious Fright is the worst example of a snowball perk and I don't understand how with all the perks that have internal cool-downs for their effects (Thrilling Tremors, Surge) they didn't consider that "reveal everyone within downing range when you down someone" wasn't one that needed a cap. I've seen tons of games end because the Killer chain downed 3 or even 2 people thanks to Infectious Fright, and I think the only reason most people don't run it is because good Killers feel like they're being unfair when they run it, and the only people who *actually* run it are morons who never pay attention to the screams and simply have it on their perk loadout because "a streamer told me it was good."
---
The only reason to buy Demise of the Faithful is meme value, and don't get me wrong I love my memes. I main Dummy Thicc Jane, Loud-ass Mother-fuckn' Ash Williams, and Funny Scoops Ahoy Steve. But there's no reason to buy the DLC for any of its characters or its perks. Watch the Shrine for Infectious Fright and Head On, or honestly don't because those perks suck dick as well. You can live without them and the world will be better off with one less person playing fucking Plague.
---
I don't think giving survivors the ability to fight back is inherently a problem, but the balance in LYTN was completely fucked at release and people figured it out within like 6 hours of playing.
---
Similar to BHVR, they clearly don't have the right type of people to do internal playtesting. They also didn't patch all the busted stuff before most players quit.
---
I personally don't like using corrupt vile, sure you don't get the range hit but I feel like the semi-game slow you get with the regular one along with the easier tracking out weights it.
---
With Suege only going 32 meters, I think aomething more than 8 percent would be a good buff-

It's so good but I just cant shake this feeling hes going to farm me

---
Will Spine Chill still be able to detect them while they're Undetectable?
---
at least they did not all DC. That is what killer is like for me.
---
I honestly don't see the the problem with this it's not like he's toxic and he provides a lot for the community IMO probably the most for any killer streamer.
---
Cheeto dust on the apron
---
Oh you got pop? How are you liking it? Also I’m glad that my stuff has helped. Unless your talking to the whispers dude lol
---
I don't mean a drastic change in size, and the doctor's skill checks aren't that bad.
---
He is not necessarily considered a sweaty player, he’s just arrogant and from time to time calls others bad for playing a certain way. He simply can’t admit his mistakes and blames it on the game’s balance. He isn’t that great at survivor and is just good at killer. He acts like he is #1 for both sides. If people disagree with him, he says they don’t play at rank 1 (which is most likely not even true) or just bans them from his chat
---
I personally like to be able to walk around the map without having to stay at a generator for 70 seconds
---
Why are you booing me I'm right.
---
It wasn’t intentionally to be like “you made a mistake,” I literally just had said I thought it was funny he ran right over hatch since it always spawns by him. Also, even if I was pointing it out in an assholish way, when creators post things, they can expect criticism and should at the very least be able to take it especially if it’s harmless or constructive. What’s got your panties in a bunch? It’s not just me that’s stating that his responses are curt. I don’t think that he has to act any certain way, and I have no problem with how he replied to me I thought it was fucking hilarious. I only said anything because I saw what they said and had the same experience.
---
Yeah man now they just don't give u the achievement
---
Maybe you shouldn't have mentioned that. People here downvote like there's no tommorrow
---
Has this person ever actuslly given suggestions for MoM?
---
No, Monto.... keep the gloves on. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
DONT TELL THE 2 YEAR OLD ABOUT SANTA!
---
Sorry homie its vampires and werewolves this season. 
---
And whatever china and japan have.. I assume demons and ghosts
---
It'll work once the upcoming update comes through.
---
When combined with certain perks, doctor skill checks can already be a bit of a pain. Add in random keys to press for the skill check and it would be very frustrating. I'd rather double the repair time on gens than have that.
---
I know, it's so easy to fix it. It's elementary shit. Maybe you should apply for a job there and rid of all the problems yourself.
---
Wat
---
No. It's something you just get used to. There are a few ways to go about hitting juking survivors. 
---
You can get close and not lunge at them, which will make it hard for them to juke. 
---
You can back up and wait for their juke if you're expecting it, so once they finish doing whatever they're doing like 360s you can hit them,
---
Or the thing I do occasionally which is to use auto aim. It's hard to describe, but if you're close enough to a survivor and lunge, usually auto aim will kick in and lock onto the survivor. Sometimes this causes attacks to miss, other times it works properly. You can usually just hold left or right on the right stick (depending on which way theyre spinning) at 100% sensitivity on remotes, and you will usually get the hit. Sorry if that's a bad way to describe It, but that's what I do. Even on pc when using an Xbox remote
---
TrUe, tRuE!
---
I've played doctor at rank 4. Not one skill check was ever missed with unnerving and overcharge.
---
I'll take it under consideration
---
Were killers "low skill" for asking for the insanel long string of survivor nerfs they've received over the last full year of updates?  No they weren't because objectively they had a lot of broken mechanics so the devs nerfed them to try to remove cheese and make playing killer feel more fun and enjoyable.
---
It isn't "low skill" to ask for the other side to be looked at once in a while when they objectively may have something a bit too strong with extremely limited counterplay short of running Iron Will every match on their side.  You just come off as extremely biased here to cartoonish levels with your adamant Us Vs. Them mentality.  Killers aren't exclusively off limits.  They are overwhelmingly balanced across the board save one standout and that is Spirit.  If you could set aside your angry bias and entitlement for a couple seconds you might be able to see that survivors bring up a few valid points about her.
---
ALSO IF YOU FLASHLIGHT ME AT EVERY POSSIBLE CHANCE
---
When you punch a kid and the next day him and his big brother show up
---
While it sucks, I think it's also important to think about the people in the game using it. Unlike Killers where there is only one at a time, survivors can potentially have FOUR people running the strong perk at the same time. This is the reason why the old versions of MoM and DS was utter BS. Bad enough it is a free escape for one guy but everyone running it and it's a nightmare. After the whole fiasco with DS and MoM, the devs are scared to make perks that are even remotely decent for survivors because it can destroy the balance.
---
My panties arent in a bunch tho. That's literally the point
---
Doctor or clown. Theyre renowned bloodpoint farmers so its easier to believe and trust them for a farm when they show signs.
---
I dont hate or dislike him, just stopped tuning in because he treats dbd like an e sport. Talking about whats optimal etc, he doesnt seem to play for fun, only to win. He should stick to fighting games, i like watching him play fighters
---
~~Maybe he means literally and wants to vore him~~
---
I'm definitely moving my sub from Puppers to Monto.
---
As odd as it sounds once I hit red ranks I've seen more variety then ever lmao
---
Since killer is no longer host on PC he doesn't join chat if he DCs.
---
I have context, thanks, since I was there. I don't care about what you think. They all rushed to the hooks every time someone was hooked. I keep my eyes out. I was going to unhook one person once I finished a gen, and I started running over and someone else got there and did it just as I got there. Another time I was waiting to unhook someone after getting a gen to 80% but the guy ran right to the house I was doing the gen in and went down so the killer eventually found me and chased me off. And another time I thought the Dwight was dead on hook (he actually had another hook) so I got involved in the chase and tried to get the killer to chase me but he didn't want to. In the entire time that I was chased, healed myself, got involved in a chase to try and get the killer off Dwight, and did a whole gen all by myself, the other two survivors didn't do a single gen and neither of them were injured so I have no idea what they hell they were doing.
---
Every time.
---
Im a we'll make it user, i cri
---
It seems theyre new too, but they learn the customs quickly.
---
Asking people to have to run a perk like iron will every game, just for the chance of spirit, would be like asking people to run calm spirit every game if doctor was meta. Losing a perk spot for situational insurance limits the perks you can bring in, which makes the game stale.
---
I stopped using WMI because even my friends would run away :(
---
Well then stop running object of obsession
---
*laughs in teleport*
---
Ok? I'm not saying it's some impossible feat to do gens through, I'm saying its already a bit annoying to deal with and that adding 3 random keys would make that even worse.
---
Because he is.
---
he just whines and whines and whines. I dont understand how people could enjoy consistently watching that.
---
Greedy dumb fucks like this cost the game for me as survivor every time. You get like a whole 60 seconds each hook phase so why rush it.
---
the perfect man doesn’t exist-
---
HOW YOU GONNA COME INTO MY STREAM AND SHIT TALK WHEN YOU CAN CLEARLY WATCH THE VIDEO OF ME BEING FRIENDLY AND NOT TUNNELING YOUR ASS SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE FUCKING FUN IN A MACTH YOU TEABAGGING FLASHLIGHT SPAMMING NUTSACK!
---
What rank do you play at?
---
I just don’t like that he uploads 1 game per video. So you get like 10 single match videos.
---
Which is probably good for his ad revenue and stuff but kind of annoying.
---
JUST BRING A DAMN MEDKIT!!!!! STOP WITH YOUR DAMN SLOPPY BUTCHER SELF HEALIN ASS!!!!! OR BOND OR FIND A TEAMMATE AND HAVE A BUTT RUB SESH!!!
---
Now listen here you lil' shit!
---
this goes both ways though as killer I get loads of cry babies who dc on their first down and as survivor I get killers who dc because they decided to chase one guy for 5minutes
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
I think made an oopsie ':D
---

---
you can just close the hatch and force the gen 2 pop

I unironicly like that.
---
Wounded Healer is still bugged too. What is it with healing??
---
Wouldn't surprise me since they completely scrapped the summer event for bugs
---
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at meeeee... 😭
---
Dude. Are you just autistic or what. Youre reading what I'm saying in a way you expect it to be said.
---
People laugh at the guy but this is precisely what's wrong with BHVR. 
---
Instead of acknowledging the issue and resolve to work on it (or admitting that they can't work on it right now), they just stay silent, which breeds discontentment and anger. They need to learn how to use open, transparent communication with their player base.
---
It's anyone but odds seem to be higher the sooner you down someone within the first minute.  Bonus multiplier if one hit hatchets on huntress.
---
Agreed! LOL!
---
I LOVE DOING THAT, PEOPLE ACTUALLY FALL FOR IT
---
I've already went through 4 of them playing this game just from struggling lol!  When you can't go straight anymore and you start hard veering right, goddamit!  Alright let's go to Target.
---
If survivors get buffs as the game go, don’t you think it’d push for less altruism/purposefully bad unhooks? Or some other things akin to that, like leading a killer towards a gen in a tight chase. 
---
Not that those things would become prevalent, just more common than they are.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

It's an "additional 8%" on top of what explosions normally do, which I read was 10%
---
You are indeed a clown.
---
The only videos with “toxic” in the title usually has toxic survivors. Teabaggers with clicking flashlights. Lately homeboy has been giving mad props to the good survivors as well, with them buffed up in the thumbnail. I think its fair to dislike the “genrush meta” though, as he plays the game, as a job, 8 hours if not more a day.
---
Thanks for noticing

But if you have a low mobility killer discordance and pop will be a lot less consistent than ruin.
---
I still hold out that one day we’re gonna get her dad as a killer too. Full Shogun Armored Massive Katana Wielding Oni Masked Samurai Maniac.
---
Weren’t the dedicated servers a test run?
---
Look at the perks, they're not lying
---
Poor Bubba
---
He clickbaits, isnt very good yet acts like he is, and is overall kinda annoying
---
Sadly true
---
Well shit. Who would've thought?
---
dedicated servers
---
Yes, it's worth it to get Myers. He may not the "best" killer in the game, but he is certainly one the FUN killers to play and play against. Since he has little to no terror radius, he can jumpscare you. He's one of the few killers that gives a more horrifying gameplay. Plus, I think DBD is one of the few games that feature Myers in their game. 
---
I remember when Myers first came out, I would literally cry out of fear whenever I play against him.
---
I agree with that, but usually those are exaggerated cause only one of the survivors is toxic, then the rest get salty when they lose.
---
Well as far as I'm concerned, you're free to look at this from any way you want. I understand that these problems have been frustrating for everyone playing, and that BHVR has taken lots of time fixing even a fraction of these issues.
---
You do have to understand though that BHVR is not a AAA game studio, and finding solutions takes a lot of time and work. Even so, every game has it's fair share of problems. (Dbd is at least getting attention, unlike TF2 is to Valve)
---
At the very least if you don't care about that, BHVR at least has listened to us in the past, and will continue to work towards resolving these issues. Once that's out of the way, it'll just be a simple bad memory many of us won't even remember. All that it takes to get there is some patience. Though it's also not a bad idea to take a break from the game if you need to relax.
---

i like it, gives me a ton of choices instead of seeing killers i don’t want to see or lame long games, i like to see the time and if it’s long or short i’ll decide what i want to see

---
Damn, people sensitive on here 😂
---
I lost some IQ points just seeing this. Thanks OP.
---
Its just too much time given back to survivors to pass up, we'll make it on one person can be something that defines if the gates are opened or not.
---
Beautiful, this is why you don't wait for the killer to see you escape
---
I... Don't have anything bad to say about this.
---
Hey buddy I think you got the wrong door
---
Fair enough, i wasnt sure if i missed something.

---
My God, that cosplay's lit! Didn't even realized it was him until I read the title
---
Thank you for typing this out after all this time. Very much appreciated!
---
There's a reason why survivors don't receive pips when they get hooked early. If you fail to sustain until later in the game, I don't think you should earn pity bloodpoints. On the other hand, I think killers should be rewarded if survivors abandon the game early by disconnecting since it's out of their control.
---
I ain’t got a sfw but still downvoted.....
---
What now?
---
I remember playing as Myers with a group of suvivors who were messing around in the carnival, it was fun, I got some screenshots
---
i call those losers bhvr's sheeps
---
even the dwight dev relase his ass as a killer and with special power killing fart those sheeps gonna buy it
---
I guess, but that has nothing to do with the event.
---
Who downdooted me for claiming dedicated servers were dedicated toilets? Why are you booing me? I’m right!
---
Where is my “light the houses in haddonfield on fire” perk?
---
The rank system for killers is awful but this is a low rank issue, either you gonna get gen rush or you’ll be able to kill/dc 2-3 players most of the time at red ranks, if you as killer can’t pip at low rank is cause you are not farming them.
---
Thumbnail from Otz's latest video btw
---
I really like this, except for the one issue that this perk becomes much worse if more than one person runs it. But I think that's a fair tradeoff to make it actually potentially usable (and again, it's still a wasted perk slot if the killer isn't camping, so even as a killer main I think it's fair)
---
Isn't Quick &amp; Quiet Nea's perk? Urban, Streetwise, and Q&amp;Q? Meg's are Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, and Adrenaline?
---
Welll he does have an Axe soooo, which says that it shouldn’t take the same amount of time as the other killers to break pallets.
---
SPINECHILL AND PREMONITION SHOULD STILL WORK ONLY AURAS ARE BLOCKED AS FAR AS I KNOW
---
Go Meg, 2 are really good.
---
I SURE HOPE SO!
---
Read that fast as "I'm Rin, a bitch"
---
A steamroll bonus for winning in under 5 minutes would actually be interesting (maybe even getting exponentially better for every 30 seconds earlier too)
---
That's fair enough then, but the rudeness was unnecessary. I wasn't suggesting that you didn't have context, merely acknowledging the fact that I didn't as a kind of disclaimer. And whether you care what I think or not, if you're going to post something on a public forum, you'd better be prepared for people to give their opinions on it.
---
200IQ plays right there
---
Lol when he froze tryna process what just happened.
---
It’s the hookers
---
so funny how everyone’s so amazed by this style of play,mostly low ranks.Anybody with a brain has been doing this since they nerfed his stalk so that you can’t keep refilling it .
---
Flip Balanced Landing and Quick &amp; Quiet 💙. QQ is Meg, BL is Nea.
---

---
Hey, I'm not the only one who got thrown off by OP's use of "we" and thinking he was talking about survivors
---
No it can't be
---
Nice try ghost-face.
---
I’ve been watching alot of videos of his lately and he does call out his own fuckups, I have seen him blame some stuff, but I think its deserved some of the time though. Also, he is a really good survivor. Alot of times he just dicks around and talks to chat. Theres been several times where he has looped a killer for multiple gens, done multiple gens and carried his teammates. I have no experience with the chat stuff as I can’t catch any of his streams. He does get a little close minded at points, but you got to remember that he plays the game as a job for 8 hours, if not more, everyday. So, since he maintains rank 1 and has for years, I think the opinion of high red rank players is stuff I would actively want to listen to too, not anything lower. 
---
While saying all this though, this game, for anybodies sake, should never be looked at as an esports game. I just look at it as a fun, party game. Saves you alot of stress and bitterness. Trying to get legion to R1 taught me that right quick lol
---
I agree.  We really need something more complicated on the survivor side.  It would add game time but also be less boring than just holding M1.  I don’t know why this sub is so hostile towards that kind of idea.
---
This is me except I’ll get a telescope out and stare into his eyeballs just for it not to reveal him
---
I like megs teachables
---
That's his point, he doesn't want to get punished for the survivors dying too early. Say if they all get hooked but no one saves anyone, you have 4 recorded hooks when the max is 12, high ranks you need all 12 to get the the pip let alone a good score in the category. This would mean regardless if you kill all the survivors, you are guaranteed a pip, the rest is based on performance.
---
Resilience
---
You tried correcting his build to be better, but ended up being incorrect. Also I don't think you can claim to "know exactly how the perk works" then immediately say you forgot how it works haha.
---
Yes your scum who should be banned
---
for real tho no its not people may complain about it at the end but in that situation its fine and in most situations where u find people in chat compaining about stuff odds are there just upset they lost
---
Probably my whispers into I’m all ears into nurses calling triple. I had 3 survivors all hurt and I found 2 via whispers and when I downed 1 I blinked to the other because I saw their outline from I’m all ears then me blinking showed the 3rd survivor healing so in around 20 seconds I got a 3 down (i hope you don’t count I’m all ears as meta because honestly it’s never used unless the killer knows what their doing)
---
Oink ;-;
---
Here is the thing: you have to balance whether or not your energy is served in a productive way. Screaming into the void does nothing but make you hoarse. 
---
You need to determine what is tolerable and what isn't. Calling people who are providing you with a product that you pay for incompetent and then waiting expectantly for something they are actively trying to fix when, admittedly, you know nothing about the problem or how to fix it is asinine. 
---
If someone is literally trying their best and youre still unsatisfied you're not doing anything productive. Video games are a pure luxury. Any luxury good is met with the same attitude. You knew what you were getting when you bought the game, don't be surprised when it does exactly what people told you it would do. 
---
Anyway, I bet you're a gem at parties; I'm gonna be a fanboy because I don't get my jollies calling people whose jobs I don't even remotely understand incompetent.
---
Well personally I say just kill the one that unhooks cause I mean it’s their fault for thinking they can just get away with it.
---
She did support women’s suffrage
---
If you want to be nice you go for the unhooker. It's likely to be a Borrowed Time save anyhow.
---
Im half tempted to get dbd for my switch and just connect it to my phones hotspot just too rage during class when we are doing nothing😁😂
---
I wasn't any more rude than you were. I meant I don't care if you don't believe me.
---
Seems it happens every time you are hitting a survivor. Gonna bet it's not their fault. Verify integrity of cache, that might fix it.
---
Ngl kinda hot doe
---
bing bon ding ding dong

Lol wow, some people still don't have all the perks unlocked? How embarrassing...

Ah I see. But to break the loops I found bamboozle and I'm all ears go well together, but why waste an extra slot

Fair. I do think it would be unfair in DBD
---
Too high pitched
---
No offense, but that comeback was kinda cringe
---
Survivors are still op by themselves if there all competent loopers
---
LOL!  Dude as much as I loathed facing Old Legion (he's totally fine post rework by the way I play him myself now that he's been decheesed) I have to give you massive props for using Insidious to make a play at something other than a hook.  Using it to camp the gen on top of it being funny as all hell is pretty much what I think the devs hoped the perk would be used for when they originally introduced it.  Kudos to you and I definitely laughed reading this.  Thanks for responding man.
---
Yes, the pic is Otz' thumbnail. I never said it was mine, I just thought of this meme when I first saw his thumbnail
---
Oh yes, finally a tier list that makes sense
---
Hatchets I can understand, since it completely nullifies the ebony head
---
Apex started 2 weeks ago and it’s still going even after Halloween.  TF2, etc.  Hell, even Fortnite has Halloween events.  Fortnitemares, awful as it is, seems to be fun for a family to play.
---
I had no idea before. It’s what got me into not only playing ghostface, but coming back to the game with my new “its a party game Doom, chill” mindset. Thats also why I added my extra flair of GFCOT addon and how to use it. Also, apologies for attacking you, I just swear that everytime tru3 is mentioned it becomes a circlejerk of hating on him.
---
I APOLOGIZE. SOMEONE ON THIS SUB SAID THEY WOULD A WHILE BACK
---
Just think of yourself in the survivors shoes. If you just got unhooked, would you want to be tunneled? Probably not. So I'd say just go for the unhooker.
---
That sucks. Especially since the killer didn’t earn the kill in this case.
---
It’s probably some delayed update on the consoles.  
---
And since they want to bring out the update at the same time, they tip toe around the truth to not annoy everybody.
---
Stealth killers are getting the undetectable status tho, so there aura won’t be shown
---
Oh damn that's deep
---
Noed applies Survivors with the Exposed Status Effect. The Exposed Status Effect is only applied with a Killers basic attack.
---
&gt;I can't explain it any better than that.
---
Thats sad because there was no explaination in this comment. 
---
&gt;You don't understand the game quite literally was a 3v1. 
---
This was quite obvious from your previous comment, and as I stated in mine, maybe she was dogshit and literally spend 20 seconds doing gens, even then thats better than her dying because she didnt heal. Even the 10 seconds the wraith needed to run to her and get that free hit and get back to looking for someome else still make her more usefull than if she found no one and just died. 
---
&gt;Yes Self Care can be done anywhere but 9 times out of 10 it simply isn't.
---
Maybe, but the 5 to 10 games i play as survivor a month people do exactly what you claim they dont. Using self care in any situation, baiting the killer, or just healing whilst hes running around the  gen you were just doing and want 5 steps to hide from (That last bit is quite rare cause its so audible, still hapens tho). Even if people did that that doesn't make the perk bad it just shows the player isnt skilled, so thats no valid argument. 
---
&gt; no clue how slow a Self Care into Sloppy and Thanatophobia is. 
---
Even my 5 games managed to show me that, but correct me if I am wrong here but both these perks affect you just as much when you get healed instead of healing yourself. It might seem less bad to you if it takes someone 25 seconds to heal you instead of 50 when you heal yourself, but the effect on stoped progress remains the same. 
---
&gt;This time is factored into their heal.
---
This is again just not a valid argument. I might as well say Neas tend to be toxic t baggers that dc on their first down and claim thats an argument why Nea sucks.
---
&gt;Again you do not stop doing everything just to look for a teamate to heal you...be productive repair a gen
---
You just stated that she got taped by a wraith doing gens, so the 3 options here are
---
1: dont heal and get oneshot, and completly removed, i explained above why thats stupid
---
2: run around looking for a heal, I think we can agree this usually wastes the most time
---
3: self care
---
&gt; if we didn't plug away at repairs injured
---
So let me get this straight: you all didnt heal, and died to get the only person who did heal and got away out. Look I dont usually run sloppy but this just makes it extremly obvious that the only reason you did die is cause you didnt power through the slow and would have rather rushed the gens with no actual use in that. This game isnt on a timer and its not a game of catch. Its simple hide and seek. Maybe next time take that minute penalty for the hit instead of dying when the gen is at 99% .
---
Nice!! I’m drawing him too rn, pretty fun to do if you don’t mess up the proportions in the first half LOL [Fugly trapper](https://imgur.com/a/xHe3gRG), keep at it dude : )
---
Surge apparently applies Overcharge and Pop for you.
---
Rank?
---
Of course, every know and then I'll still throw the perk on, most of the time when I use it for gen camping two more pop in the time I wait lol, but the times it works are all glorious
---
Oh man another one of these?  Can't you just use NOED if you can't play without it but acknowledge that it's a crutch?  It's the killers that run it and pretend they're gods that annoy people.  I think most of us would be satisfied with simple acknowledgement.
---
I was rank 8 last season but im rank 11 rn
---
From when you posted your comment, there was only one comment mentioning it. Wdym.

#Current:

You are apt at handling machinery with the greatest care and precision.
---
The noises caused by your Repairs and their hearing distance are reduced by 8 metres.
---
On a failed Repair Skill Check , there is a 30/40/50 % chance that the Generator  explosion will be prevented.
---
# Revised:
---
Great Skill Checks grant a bonus 1/2/3% progression when repairing a Generator.
---
While Repairing, Skill Check Success zones are reduced by 10% and you have a 15% increased chance of triggering a Skill Check.
---
Turns it into a great perk for busting out Generators, if you're actually skilled enough to land Greats consistently.
---
YOU ARE WELCOME, I AM HAPPY TO CORRECT ANY MISINFORMATION OR CONFUSION
---
I didn’t even notice the crow 😭
---
Just scroll past them then
---
Nah why is it ok for survivors to run d-strike, adrenaline, borrowed time, deliverance, unbreakable and there is nothing wrong with it. Why dont u say they have no skill and they rely on those perks to survive because they are crutch than noed because u know why because killer cant do shit about them. They have to take it and there is no playing around it without killer losing in one way or another. Even with d-strike he can get up after 1 minute or killer can just waste 1 min of his time in just sitting there.
---
I found TrU3Ta1ent's account haha
---
Leatherface in the basement be like ''come here i'll give you the hatch''
---
But then all the pc gamers are going to scream at them, to just release the thing.  
---
This way, no one really knows and is not quite as upset.
---
On the Ghost Face dev stream his dance was fucking adorable though
---
Fuck I missed it I was at work
---
Good meme but a repost so rip my upvote
---
Personally, no it doesn't and I'll get downvoted for it by jfc this is toying with your food survivor shouldn't expect to live past this to begin with
---
Edit so what I'm gathering is everyone just let's the survivor get to the hatch? Even though the game is a killer killing people and survivors are trying to survive? K
---
If its a trap in doorway (especially in an indoor map) then you could easily lose the Trapper by doing it in a chase. I guess it could be useful for dukes too if youre not directly in chase as the trapper wouldn’t guess that you had dead harded over the trap and wouldn’t look that way.
---
I HAVEN'T PLAYED A GAME WITHOUT TOXIC PLAYERS IN DECADES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE IN THIS GAME ??? BETWEEN HAVING THE SAME MYER 3 TIMES IN A ROW USING THE SAME ULTRA RARE ADD-ON AND COOPERATING WITH A CLAUDETTE, OR THE MATCHMAKING COMPLETELY BROKEN (I'M ENDING UP WITH RANK 20 EVEN THOUGH I'M RANK 9), OR THE NURSE SLUGGING, OR THE FACECAMP. AND WHY I ALWAYS END WITH SHITTY SURVIVORS HIDING IN THE CORNER OF THE MAP AS SURVIVOR BUT ALWAYS BEING AGAINST SWF FULL FLASHLIGHT AS A KILLER AT A LOWEST RANK...
---
You can get one in one bloodweb, usually every bloodweb after a certain level. Ease of acquisition doesn't change the poor balance of certain addons (though tombstone is not OP, but mories definitely are), this isn't a gear-based loot game like Destiny or some MMORPG. Mories take away 1/3 of the survivor's lives for nothing. I don't care if you have to pay $200 per eboni mori or how "legit" you think that purchase is, that's terrible for balance.
---
Amazing work but try adding curves to the bodt a bit
---
I am speed.
---
I mentioned death garden
---
60 seconds spent not running, you mean.
---
I've had this happen in reverse to me. I'll be chasing a survivor and they just fucking teleport twenty miles away
---
I am not saying that noed is a good one, but the people make it that killer running noed is a noob and he has no skill and he should not run it. 7/10 people would say that. Even personally I dont run it 99.99% but the other day I was playing a daily for my doctor and I did not level him up and people in the end game chat are like you noob why are u running noed u have no skill. I dont understand why. If that is the case then people should also start calling survivors who run d-strike, adrenaline, deliverance, unbreakable as noobs and they don't have any skill because its like their second chance like noed does. But no one does that, in fact people will say you should run those perks if you want to win. Why is it different for the other part.
---
Because she's badly designed and desperately needs a rework.
---
Ppl just expect devs to crunch and burn out so they can have updates fast. It's not that easy sometimes. I'd rather they fix shit and not torture themselves over it so they can support the game longer and everyone can be happy.
---
PEOPLE WHO PURPOSELY LEAVE TEAMMATES ON HOOKS DESERVE TO BE TUNNELED. I FIND KILLERS DECIDING TO LEAVE THEIR FRIENDS ON THE GROUND AS BAIT AND THEN GIVING THEM THE HATCH SUPER ANNOYING. NO WONDER KILLERS GET THE TBAG AT THE GATE BECAUSE OF SHIT LIKE THIS.
---
 THE DEVS SHOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR KILLERS TO LOSE POINTS BECAUSE OF BULLSHIT. IF THEY TAKE TOO LONG TO HOOK OR HIT. -1000 POINTS. IF THEY DROP THEIR FRIENDS NEAR THE HATCH OR GATE -2000 POINTS.
---
THE PEOPLE AT MY GYM HANDED MY ID TO SOMEONE ELSE AND NOW I HAVE TO PAY FOR A REPLACEMENT
---
Spirit. She takes no skill and is annoying to fight. She is a broken mechanic and her and nurse should not be as strong as they are. Coming from a p350 spirit and nurse who has made rank one with them. There is no counter. She stand still, run away from the loop and die, or stay at the loop and die. A good spirit will always win unless they have four instaheals. She’s just not fun
---
Vommy Mommy :(
---
&gt;Self caring is half the speed of a heal from someone else so that is harshly compounded by the effects of the loadout. It only makes sense healing against that loadout when it's from another survivor.
---
Do you even maths bro? I stated this 3 times now and it isnt hard to understand. Self care takes twice as long to heal you yes, but it only takes you out of the game. 1 player, leaving 3 to do gens. When you get healed its twice as fast, yeah, but it takes 2 players out of the game, leaving only 2 for gens. There is no diffrence, take a calculator if you must. 
---
&gt;gens don't get done by self cares
---
Duh, I dont play much survivor but getting to killer rank 1 teaches you a thing or two even without player survivor or knowing all the perks. Of course you dont get the gens done by healing but you can do them just as well 2 minutes later after your entire team healed up and not risk dying to a hit and run killer, whats so hard to get about that? 
---
&gt;Had she took any of those 5 minutes she spent hiding and healing to participate in the gen repairs it never would have came down to that situation.
---
Or she might have died after one minute, leaving you with 3 people that can be much easier controlled since theres literally 1 less of you. I red your description of the game, and what it seems to come down to is you acting like there some kind of timer that forced you 3 to pressure gens whilst she focused on surviving over doing gens. Ill say it again, next time heal up before doing gens, you might not have to watch her run out whilst beeing at 99% gen repair. Instead your gen might be at 40% for a minute or two and you can heal to eventually actually get out.

[3 INSTA HEAL](/intensifies) SWF TEAM CALLED ME CANCER FOR BEADS ON SPIRIT, BRUH
---
Get the Pop goes the Weasel if you play kiiller at all. I dare say it's top 3 perk after Ruin and BBQ. It works well with either perk. It's my personal favorite to use.
---
The point of the video was the play not the audio. you must be fun at parties huh??
---
Wow did they just really mess up on their own Twitter? This is too good.
---
I use Discordance, Thanatophobia, Thrilling Tremors and Bloodwarden
---
Best legion build is Ghostface
