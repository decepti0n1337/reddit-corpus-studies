If you were able to attempt to escape the killer would just camp the hook and down you instantly
---
---
---
Bricky does very good (though at times outdated) casefiles on the DBD killers. He got up to Clown and then stopped, but he’s continuing it again very shortly with the Spirit.
---
please god i need more dbd lore in my veins
---
Because they happen at end game and give you a big enough advantage over the other one.
---
It is 33 seconds. That's the penalty. If 3 people work together on 3 gens, it takes 99 seconds to finish 3 gens.
---

---
If 3 people work alone on 3 separate gens, it takes them all 80 seconds. But they'd all finish at the same time and only have spent 80 seconds instead of 99.
---
The same concept applies when working as a group of 2 or 4. As a group of 2, it takes 44 seconds to complete 1 gen, or 88 seconds to complete 2 gens. 2 survivors could just finish 2 gens in 80 seconds.
---
4 survivors take 27.5 seconds to finish a gen, or 110 seconds to complete 4 gens. They could've just worked alone and finished 4 gens in 80 seconds.
---
Think of when you’re at a shit loop. The small ones, a good example being the one right next to campbells chapel. You drop the pallet, what happens next? The killer moves from side to side, you keep vaulting back and forth, eventually he catches you off guard and hits you.
---
Think of a medium loop. The killer may need bloodlust 3 before they can catch you off guard and get a hit if they dont break the pallet
---
Now think of the shack. Once that pallets down how does the killer hit you? They cant. Not even with bloodlust 3. They MUST break the pallet.
---
There are other pallets this strong and windows, the shack pallet is the one thats there on every map.

I know this is kinda old, but I think Wraith is a great option. He's not the best killer, and he's not the most viable for higher ranks, but I think he's very fun to play. Id rather have a fun game than a game where I get 4ks but I feel bored out of my mind.
---
Wraith has really good tracking perks, and especially for a new player, they can be VERY useful. I also think the Leatherface idea is a good one. Level LF until you can unlock BBQ&amp;Chilli, and then level Wraith until BBQ appears in your blood web.
---
One thing I will mention about Wraith is that he can be burnt using torches out of his cloaked mode. Which kinda sucks, but it's a very fair mechanic. 
---
If you don't choose Wraith, that's absolutely fine and I understand completely, but if there's a few killers I definitely DO NOT recommend to you, as a new player, I'd say Huntress, Spirit and Trapper. 
---
Huntress is slow and chucking hatches is harder than you'd expect and Spirit relies on you being able to track efficiently and since her power only shows you scratch marks, you have to guess as to where the person you're chasing is. 
---
Trapper on the other hand, is a viable new player killer, but to get the most out of his traps, you have to know loop locations and be familiar with how survivors loop killers. If not, you won't know the prime locations for traps and you'll never end up actually catching anyone. Extremely annoying when you get to hugger ranks, and people keep sabo'ing them.
---
Idk if ur making a meme and I'm wooshing myself but. Worse than this is being a rank 1 with rank 12-14s like Noob3 got once (I think, not sure if he got paired with SWF tho).
---
No plz bhvr.
---
I was telling my buddy who was in the game that I thought about it but hesitated because I didn’t know how far he was behind me lol
---
I mean I feel that but your free to leave a game whenever you want, plenty of people already do that so it's really not a big deal if one more person does it.
---
Sure it sucks to be on the team with a DC but honestly it happens so often that no one will remember one extra dc
---
Your'e a funny guy survy, I like you, that's why I'll kill you last.
---
No cause then it would defeat the purpose of decisive
---
&gt;Toxic Survivors
---
&gt;Brings 4 BPS’s
---
wot
---
Definitely. When I first played her I could only ever get 1 hit on a survivor before losing them. Left her and played other killers for a long time. Came back and I was doing ok with her. Then put in practise and got better.
---
Nurse requires some muscle memory, but playing other killers you’ll get a feel for the games mechanics more and improve your tracking abilities and map sense
---
How
---
Nice man of mettle edit lol
---
a lot of perks activate at the end game
---
I have actually never searched via new posts, only ever ‘hot’ posts, so when I got a crazy Rank set up I thought oh I’ll upload that to reddit see what the bois think... Yikes there are literally hundreds. BAD ME TIMEOUT TIME
---
Unless the one of them is being toxic. Quick as possible mori for them.
---
The last game I played I was only a few feet away from the person who just got hooked. I was about to unhook them but they ended up disconnecting just because they were the first to get hooked.
---
Title checks out.
---
Yeah, but they are not as strong as this one and as apparently free as these ones.
---
Before EGC, I had several games where the last survivor didn’t even try to leave. Lasted 30 minutes just looking for them. That was bad.
---
get a really good set of head phones and youll be a pro
---
Steve I swear to g-
---
And red moris and items, don't forget.
---
Just for laughs:
---
So anytime the survivors play against Bruce the level is filled up to the survivors crouched nose level with water. Below ground areas are flooded and survivors suffer a drowning effect (similar to bleed out) while their heads are submerged. Elevated areas are unavailable to Bruce.
---
Da duhnt: Bruce can speed burst. He moves at 150% speed for four seconds with a 40 second cooldown. He can attack while speed boosting. This burst can allow him to charge onto accessible land. He then has to flip flop back into the water. While Bruce is carrying someone to the hook he has them in his mouth and chews. The longer they are carried, the longer their next heal takes.
---
Perks:
---
It'll eat anything: The killer can consume any tools on the ground. This action takes 8/6/4 seconds. (Bruce would just eat the item. Other killers would destroy the item.)
---
Blood in the Water: When the killer is within 4/6/8 meters of an injured survivor, he can see their aura.
---
And those black eyes roll over white: When the killer makes a successful attack, his cooldown animation is reduced by 20%/30%/40%.
---
Do a Huntress V.S. Myers stun rap

Just finished a game were we had three gems left. I finished one, someone finished another while I looped the killer while our third camped the hatch. The two of us actually working ended up dying. The camper complained because we didn’t get the last gen done but then took too long to die. 
---
Dude does nothing, escapes, and still complains.
---
No. No cc should be longer than 3 seconds honestly.
---
There is some sweet catharsis in this clip
---
I can see this in Samination's next episode XD
---
Until that unholy day your account gets banned for too many disconnects XD
---
This is a fun and creative thing, I unironically love and need this
---
In PS4 case, the playerbase isn't that great so you kinda just get queued up with whoever is on, but matchmaking is pretty shit on all platforms rn
---
Wait, Stranger Things comes out THIS TUESDAY?
---
Cross map chainsaws are SOOO satisfying.
---
Seems like an easy win with that jucy noed. Are you playing spirit?
---
You should give me his or hers gamertag so I can report and block them
---
&gt; tho there is a lot of respectful twitch streamers
---
Too bad none of them play dbd.
---
The audio made it soo much better! Take my upvote
---
The new freddy is awesome
---
Don't get me wrong, I get the benefit. I just hate dying on hatch because people need to wait at the exit until the killer gives them attention.
---
No a good survivor can use and reuse that against a killer in multiple chases.  Basically loop the window until they force it to block off then continue running away from the shack and use a nearby pallet instead.  You'll still have the shack whole to be able to use it again.  Of course that's the gameplan until a random Meg camps and tosses God pallet immediately to avoid their first hit.
---
Entity, the ranks are drunk!
---
Only if Bruce from Finding Nemo does voice lines.
---
I hate when survivors wait for the hooked one to die just to get the hatch... Unless the killer is camping
---
Play base is fucking awful I had someone dm me gore as a killer once when u first started playing. I genuinely hope they bother to fix this sometime because its ass
---
I’m a rank 12 killer but purposely derank sometimes so I can enjoy the game. Also I respect the bottom guys build, I hate the meta only builds
---
Honestly I feel killers should get bp equal to a sacrifice for a dc, and survivors should get a healthy sum for a teammate dc-ing aswell.
---
Disconnecting because someone’s camping is being a poor sport and screwing up your teammates chances at all. 
---
That’s why D/Cing is looked down apon. 
---
I also personally look down apon it.
---
Yes it’s a few minutes of your life wasted staring at an endless screen and then pressing 1 button down. But the point of the game is to rank up and by you staying there you help your teammates be able to escape or rank up. 
---
Also teammates may just comeback after exit gates are opened and I’ve had that before. 
---
If you still don’t understand then idk man. It’s just selfish to D/C.
---
Oh, is that the correct response? I always think "I AM THE CHOSEN ONE".
---
I actually think that would be kinda cool. Maybe a trapper weapon or something idk
---
I think bhvr is testing something out right now, and the matchmaking is a little fucked.
---
I mean originally the Scream films were going to be called Scary Movie. Wes Craven (rip) actually had a robe that was gifted to him from the studio that says “Scary Movie” on it but shortly after they changed the title. Hence the reason why the movies making fun of Scream &amp; various others is called Scary Movie!
---
Tbh what post isn't spam. DS nerf? Spam. BT nerf? Spam. NoED nerf? Spam. Literally any meme? Spam. Sorry dude any and all posts at this point whether it be discussions, questions, shitposts, rants, etc are all spam since we have seen them over and over again. Just something u gotta live with on Reddit sadly.
---
Poor baby dwight doesn’t know what’s going on :(

Wow someone’s triggered.
---
\*unhappy\*
---
Just requeue? I don't get the problem...
---
Scary Movie 
---
Scary Movies (with an S) 
---
Completely different words that mean 2 different things.
---
I know this is old, and I apologise, but the guy saying this.. 
---
Do they realise if they just knew how to *not* go down once the exit gates are powered, he wouldn't even be facing this problem in the first place?
---
If you get downed when end game starts, you might as well just accept the fact you're not making it out. The killer deserves the win, considering the survivor decided to be terrible at running away at the last home stretch.
---
Not at all. I just don’t care for Neas.
---
Tell that to porn.
---
Looks great!
---
This shits on everything she has now.  This is a Nea grade cosmetic for Kate!  About time.
---
It's not abnormal if you get some purple/yellow ranks in a rank 10 lobby. Red ranks is pushing it though.
---
i hope they can fix it soon
---
You are a lot better at verbally recapping your games off memory then I ever could. I'm just like "I find guy and hit guy til he hit ground then throw him on hook and find another"
---
Oiiiink! &lt;3
---
Wait, is that ultra quality?My eyes, are healed.
---
No, you are misunderstanding. I was making a point over what they are prioritising, not saying that they are making cosmetics which is stopping them making the fix.
---
Well it wouldn't completely defeat the purpose because decisive is an instant get off the shoulder
---
Then you're not looking in the right place. There's tons of amazing streamers for DBD.
---
Funny thing is it’s usually bad killers who call good survivors toxic because they get relentlessly looped or mind gamed. The only thing survivors can do is try and survive and if trying to survive is toxic then you’re a moron lol. 
---
It’s far easier for a killer to be toxic than a survivor. The only real toxic thing a survivor can do is teabag at an exit gate or say some bullshit in the after game chat.
---
Can't remember the 4th perk but Ruin, Bloodhound and MYC are some of my favourites to run on Wraith.
---
I was about to go off on you sis
---
Stop Writing Like This Please
---
personally I prefer etak's new cosmetic on the right
---
Make benedict Baker the first one to die, maybe like cause he saw this dude as new as so protected him.
---
Are are we still making benedict faceless.

[Bruh, same!](https://imgur.com/gallery/lEKcoIt)

All of pigs and ghostfac's skins have been very subtle and dark, wraith has bright things but can turn invisible I don't understand what stealth killers with bright skins you're thinking of?
---
Adrenaline isn't free though, you have to collectively complete all the gens for it to activate.
---
Huntress mains are the kids who use to shoot their laundry in the basket like it was a basketball and hoop.
---
Everyone has to start somewhere. Having low views has nothing to do with "talent". I know a ton of amazing people that average out around 30 views and I have a blast watching them.
---
The point is that they are prioritising paid cosmetics over something meaningful like the reward the original players get to show the dedication they had to the game when it had a small player base. The original players have nothing to show for their dedication over time.
---
What do you mean writing like this
---
Don’t buy a lot of cosmetics...
---
Finished a game against a huntress running a triple hatchet one shot build, but their aim was so bad that they hit less than 40% of their throws. I told them that if they were gonna play a toxic build they should at least learn to aim first, and I got the generic "ur just mad lol" excuse, which was hilarious since he rage quit the chat and had his profile private.
---
It would feel very out of character with how she plays if the pig had voice lines
---
I WANT A JOHN KRAMER SKIN
---
No huntress, and the perks are complete shit but I really don't have anything else at all to replace them with
---
Little advice when playing killer you should always try hard
---
Wh... who are you? :-O
---
This happened to me with a david with no mither

Guess I should clear the air for you. Rumor has it they only got the rights to the mask I was sad too
---
You guys are jerks

steve because he is my new main, but nancy has better perks

so idk :(
---
He's a priest named Michael

He crossed it twice

how would the map game work would one part be flooded and top not have any?  Or would water start from the top flowing down the stairs filling up both areas and adding drains and pipes to fill and drain the water constantly?

Yeah, after getting Left Behind III by level 9 on my Bill today, I was reminded how little this change actually does to alleviate a lot of the concerns of leveling for perks through blood webs.

No. They don't need to do that, as having cosmetics doesn't improve your ability to play the game whatsoever. Also, it would just be bad business. You can already buy a ton of cosmetics with iridescent shards.
---
&gt;so they can't keep dodging SWF
---
Kinda tired of people thinking that this is the effect's purpose. The point was so that a full lobby could appear and begin the game much sooner, not to hide SWF. "Hiding" SWF is only a side effect of the proposed change.

Community: All of those mean killers who gonna derank to bully new survivors &gt;:(
---
broken matchmaking that can match rank 1 players with rank 20s: Hi!
---
True, props for the last dude.
---
*Wall disconnects*
---
You ain't wrong. Guy basically camped his Huntresses Lullaby half of the game, missed several hatchets, tried to hatchet me while right next a pallet (Getting him stunned like a dipshit), and then because he killed everyone he acted like he was above us all. It never gets old.
---
I’ve had the worst teammates today. Then I finally had a decent match going where the killer and survivors were evenly matched. He killed two of us and we had one gen left. I was almost done with it but was injured. My teammate was getting chased and ran right to me. Killer downs and hooks me. Teammate doesn’t try and save. Of course she was at the hatch waiting for me to die.
---
Ding dong my karma is gone
---
I just don't see why not? Decisives stun seems to give you an appropriate time without the killer losing sight of them or their tracks.
---
Seeing how you can camp and mori your way to rank 1 with Pop, ruin and NOED.  Once you get to red ranks with actual good survivors they are gonna shit all over your crappy killer style.   Most know to gen rush when you camping as they can easily get 3 gens done before he dies.  Its devs fault that killers are soft at red ranks, they babied them all the way there with their perks and pipping system.
---
Jesus man really. 
---
It’s the whole thing he used. The guy says I don’t like Scary Movies to which the Franchise is called Scream and the Parody is called Scary Movie. 
---
And that’s what I was talking about. How he took something that absolutely makes no sense and combines it together.
---
NOED isn't free either. You're giving up a perk slot for the majority of the match to get a huge boost at the end.
---
jokes on you, they are both coming on wednesday
---
Yes! :)
---
but doc can be stealth killer
---
Dude what do you not understand from what I’m saying? You could care less means you do care. You literally care enough that you could care LESS than you do. If you said you COULDNT care less it means you care as little as possible. You literally couldn’t care any less.
---
Also just because this meme has 90+ likes doesn’t mean people are “stupidly oblivious” it just means they got the joke.
---
If you got hooked in 10 seconds you suck and the killer was facecamping you to get you to quit playing.
---
Just think happy thoughts whenever your team sucks! Lol https://www.twitch.tv/videos/475506178
---
I love Feng in general but just delete that one horrible creature, its killing my eyes
---
I feel this, for a while there everyone thought they where N00b3
---
That's not really the same to be honest, the remix in the official DbDxST trailer sounded *slick* meanwhile this is just "meh"
---
Getting hooked in 10 seconds and being hooked in the first 10 seconds of the match are 2 entirely separate worlds. I would expect anyone who’s played enough hours on this game to realize that.
---
Very good work  nice
---
She’s my favourite by far!
---
God... if they never nerfed ds.... \*shivers\*
---
I’m just proud of being rank 8 by level 50. I’ve not long come back to the game just really enjoying it
---
I love how he's equipped with those bad ass salt shakers.
---
Someone unhook + deliverance + killer grabbing the unhooker is also comical.
---
I love things like this. Always make for a good laugh in post game.
---
I can totally see how that's frustrating for higher ranks. Where's the challenge in that, other than watching your teammates flail and drag you down with them? 
---
PS4 wait times are ridiculous and then theres the matchmaking itself. I hope they'll give a fraction of their time to make this game playable again sometime.
---
Definitely the doctor's madness.
---
Michael Morrison?
---
people get triggered when you call their shit out
---
Ghostface is the cutest. 2nd to The Pig. When I see them crouching around the map all stealth like, I really just want to walk up and give them a hug.

Anyone hatin on Steve is gonna be reeeeal unhappy for the rest of their matches, until the end of time xD

New main forever

It won't, i had friends being matched with purple's while they are still 20.
---
Our only hope is for them to surprise us with a fix along with the update :(
---
Don’t have one **sob**
---
Why did someone downvote this comment?
---
Fix it
---
Bit of background...the rest of his team were dead and he not only got up from Unbreakable but he kobed off the hook just as the other last survivor died. So since he got himself off the hook I thought, I'll give him the hatch.
---
He kept trying to wiggle out every time I carried him, when I finally found the hatch I was like 'go mate, be free'. 
---
Never seen a survivor not go for the hatch when offered.
---
Man I wish they would bring back multi stalk for Myers (and buff his deviousness bp gain). I started playing killer with Myers and he used to be my main, but as the time goes and the new killers being added, he becomes less and less fun and viable.
---
-.- someone dc in the loading
---
El em ay oh
---
I used to use it all of the time,
---
but when I was leveling up david I realized I didn't need it.
---
You may think you need it because it can tell you when a killer is coming to your location/stalking you/near.
---
But when I stopped using it I realized a very simple concept.
---
The terror radius or lullaby coming closer, is your cue to get out of there.
---
claudette in particular had the worst of her cosmetics changed not long ago, and people were pissed about it.
---
Imo, decisive should give a shorter stun, and wiggling should do 5 seconds. Bc you deserve that stun if you pretty much ALLOWED the mf to wiggle out of your grasp. And it would make iron grasp more viable, although it already is but it would be better in this case. Whereas DS should definitely do AT MOST a 3 second stun since you can just run towards a locker and for the killer to pick you up.

Poor thing just gives up, kinda like me when i see a claudette teabagging behind a pallet and it turns out Myers has Fragrant Tuft of Hair.
---
Not too long ago I was there when we had to wait 15+ minutes for a match consistently (I think the longest I waited was over 30 minutes) and it was super unplayable with more than one other person in swf. 
---
I mean wait times are still not where they could be but I'm hoping once Dedicated servers are out for a while (and out of the shitty beginning stage because we all know that's going to happen) that wait times will be much much better.
---
At the very least I'm impressed they're consistently working on improving their game so I guess that's some guiding light
---
Gone, reduced to atoms
---
That happened before too.  You just had to wait to bleed out.
---
Why did you delete your comment? I was interested.
---
I keep hearing about the Blood Hunt, what exactly is it?
---
You right, I think I just think of in-game as in like, during a match. Pardon my ambiguity.

Tbh the brother being forced to kill for the entity would be /tragic/ but I would main him, definitely.

Run Dying Light instead.

Y’all still out here wanting decisive to be nerfed?

How so spirt if she phase walks it’s obvious

Damn, straight. Same here. I’ve decked out my steam profile to the Max with Steve stuff! Can’t wait.
---
Oh okay thank you, and what about BTP or something like that i keep seeing
---
I remember a game i had a while ago where the obsession dc’d when the game started and the killer had dying light...I don’t think it ended well.
---
Oh no for sure he was cool. I think he was actually Incredibly powerful before his rework if used in a specific way. Yeah I almost bought him b4 the rework multiple times.
---
It's not really even a bad nerf, tbh it's pretty generous. Or similar to another guy's post, I said they should swap the stun times of wiggling off of a killer and using DS
---
Haha, I meant itchy, stupid auto correct.
---
Aaand that's why you leave once the gates open. No second thoughts, no bms. Just fucking bolt out of there.
---
Nope. I’m still only rank 21,
---
As a Kate main I’m happy to finally get something that looks good so far I’ve been rocking, gold cascade hair with ugly sweater and slit leather skirt to make her some what fashionable
---
Chief Brody survivor and Amity island map? :^) 
---
Love this idea btw.
---
It has a higher chance of spawning there, but will spawn literally anywhere on the map
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Yeah same, it’s what we deserve!
---
BNP=brand new part
---
BT=borrowed time
---
STBFL=save the best for last
---
DH=dead hard
---
BL=balanced landing
---
Those are some common ones used
---
that Just happened to me, I just killed myself on the hook bc my teammates were coming to save me and the guy was with insidious on the corner of the basement ;-;
---
Likewise fellow great community member. Glad we could settle this conflict
---
You dont sacrifice anything, there are so many tricks to down people with Billy, he's way better than leatherface
---
I remember saying "pls don't eat my ass spirit" (referring to the meme I've seen on here before)
---
It was a pleasure disagreeing with you today. I hope to see you in the fog some day.
---
Yeah I think the first 200 posts about it this entire week have made us more than aware of it.
---
What’s the release date for stranger things can’t wait to play it
---
Someone’s a tunneler and has an issue with ds 🙄
---
Oh my a DBD Slasher miniseries would be awesome
---
and what did it cost him?
---
I wonder.  
---
I'm not defending him, but if Insidious is a thing this should be a legit strat.
---
Bro you'd be surprised with how many dumbasses I get on Xbox. People would use deliveram almost immediately after I hook them, and I usually run towards the other side of the map sense I main Doctor, I can always have a general sense if someone's location so it's like "wtf are you doing my guy"
---
I think you can also leave with the RBT in any health estate if you're the last survivor
---
&gt;Gameplay
---
I mean I wouldn't really call it a waste, that locker heal seems like a nice ass perk, I'd use tf out of it
---
Whats in the first picture? I can’t see it
---
Dc now for the funsies
---
Probably gonna get hate for saying this, but I honestly see an equal amount of tryhards on both sides. Red ranks are no fun man.
---
Sorry about that toxic Dwight, I don’t like those people that give us a bad name.
---
Do you know how much it probably costed them to get the licensing they have gotten? They picked some big name franchises, and they got them when they were way smaller than they are now (meaning, at the time, the revenue generated from just people buying the dlc probably wasn’t enough to justify spending even more on the dlc anyway). Also, the licensing with the nightmare franchise is difficult to work with anyway. Wes Craven had wanted to end the series for a LONG time and didn’t want anything else to be done with it, and since he died in 2015, New Line has just been pulling/not renewing Nightmare licenses (to put it simply, pretty much no one is allowed to do anything with the original nightmare series or its characters, and the licenses are probably stiff with the remake as well). John Carpenter felt similarly for a long time as well (he never liked what directors and writers did for any of the Halloween sequels and especially not the remakes, which is why he came back to work on the most recent 2018 film [and its upcoming sequels] and most likely why there’s so /little/ content of Halloween outside of films). The actors and actresses have no rights to the characters at all, unless people want to use their likenesses, but when you buy licenses to the character and not the likeness of the actor, there’s no reason to contact the actor.
---
Yeah, but come on. That + DS + Head On ? You can pull that off once per game (and let's be honest, it won't happen every time at all). Then, you become a perkless survivor. Not worth it.
---
finishing a gen is necessary, the difficulty of it doesn't matter, and yes a default gen takes 80 seconds to complete, if the killer does nothing to stop or regress it and if the survivor never makes a mistake.
---
Carrying a survivor to a hook isn't difficult either without any disruption from survivors, but that's still the primary goal of the killer, the killer has several perks that reward them for hooking survivors, letting survivors unhook each other, and so on. Those are all fine.
---
I never mentioned anything about NOED being difficult to take care of, the main point I'm making is how are these 2 considered equal, or at least draw so many similarities between each other, even though they fundamentally reward you for 2 entirely different reasons.
---
There has been talk about him coming. I personally like the idea, but many people don't
---
Everything.
---
They should honestly just swap the stun times from wiggling a Killer's grasp with ds stun time. Tbh I feel like killer should be stunned for fuckin 7 seconds because you ALLOWED then to escape. i always go for the first hook I see. Instead of trying to walk across the entire map for the basement without a basement build
---
It’s not certainly not too late, I just started and I know for a fact I need all the help and advice I can get, lol. Thank you so much for all of this info!! I will definitely be playing Wraith a lot more because I find what you’re saying to be entirely true. I appreciate the suggestions + warnings (I haven’t tried huntress or trapper yet but I completely understand now how they can be so difficult for beginners). Thank you again!! :)
---
I feel the same way! The way he pokes his head around a corner is just amazing, and the animation for when he finds someone in a locker: all jokey and fun. They put a lot of personality in him and makes him super fun to watch. He's also cute because he's way shorter than the other killers so seeing a smol boi sneak around the map with glee is great. Ghostface seems like he wants to kill survivors, but maybe all he really wants is a hug.
---
Ah sorry about that
---
WB can’t do anything about it right now. New Line has been pulling/not renewing licenses for the Nightmare franchises, especially since Wes Craven passed in 2015. Additionally, Craven didn’t /want/ any new content with his version of freddy, he had wanted the series to end even before the New Nightmare film almost 20 years ago.
---
The full thing says "ha I'm covering this up because I'm poor and don't have money for the full version"
---
Don’t.... do this. Lmao there is absolutely no reason to spam them about something like this.
---
3+ blink nurse with ebony mori and noed is also a legit strat, doesnt mean it's fun to go against tho.
---
True true true, but they could give DS a 2 time use with this nerf. That'll probably get survivor mains happy.
---
Got facecamped three times today, I didnt even teabag or play toxic.
---
I love this community.
---
Wtf is that build
---
You gotta do what you gotta do, man.  
---
We salute you.
---
The licensing for the Nightmare franchises are incredibly complicated, that’s why. 
---
BHVR is working WITH Netflix, which is why they got to do so much with the chapter.
---
Why the tbag after every pallet?
---
More of a left for dead 2 thing than a DBD thing
---
U a dude man?
---
Ghostfaces slash enthusiast is my probably my favorite set but the demogorgons chain cosmetics we saw in the trailer looks pretty good and I mean the demogorgon in general looks great
---
Also he’s hot
---
No I’m feng min...
---
Oh shit it is, didn’t notice till you said, thenk
---
Or my other idea where they should swap ds and wiggle out stun times, and make wiggling out of a killer have a longer stun given how uncommon it is unless the killer is just walking you around the map instead of getting the closest hook
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
---
Btp is probably a misspelled ptb
---
I never realy understood the hate for every single streamer. I get there are alot of toxic wannabes with a 1 viewr stream that scream bloody murder when something doesnt go their way , but you dont know if thats what you are going to be facing. I have a friend that streams and the amount of people that play scummy and trash talk us at the end JUST because she is a streamer is incredible. I see so many more moris, tunnelling and camping and noed when i play with her than when i solo que its crazy. And wheather she escapes or not we get the obligatory trash talk at the end( yes i know this happens to everyone but they specifically mention her stream) . Why is wanting to be a streamer punished in this game ?
---
Here, take my upvote
---
Do you know that it’s also because Bruce Campbell (and a friend from school) created the character and the film series, and that’s why it’s easier to get him involved with anything relating to the character? Because he literally owns the character?
---
You're just trying to create unnecessary fuss at this point. A two times use of DS would be ridiculous, no matter the side.
---
Gay
---
nice
---
He didn’t kill anyone the entity did
---
Nobody is going to stop playing the game they're currently playing just to go watch someone because they're advertising twitch in their name, It's literally asking to be stream sniped &amp; then the streamer complains about being tunneled and BM'ed
---
Haha funny thanos quote give me up votes hahaha
---
FALCON PUNCH
---
You're a heartless fucking monster.
---
Clown with Santa oufit

🙄
---
I’ll look into it. My dad and I came up with a power but it might be a little OP. The power could be that he could shape shift into a fellow survivor but he could have a serious give away but from a distance, looks like a normal survivor. Could be easily countered by swf though
---
Asshole
---
the videos power was similar to that i think
---
This is the same bug that causes you not being able to escape through the exit gates I believe. When that bug happened to me the bug you are talking about happened as well.
---
If you're not playing for meta, you should consider looking into his abilityvand how much fun you think that you'll have playing him. If he fits your style, definitely. If you don't think you'll play him much, dont bother.
---
Joke’s on you, I find that shit hilarious.
---
tbh it could be worse. at least they're not all running adrenaline. were they super sweaty and toxic in game?
---
Daddy Myers is way hotter
---
Plus we don’t have teammates to depend  on, tends to be a lot more laid back. Sometimes lol.
---
I’m not even a killer main and this is very cathartic. Anyone who thinks tbagginng and clicking is okay deserves a mori.
---
imo there really isnt any reason that they havent added this in the game
---
What perk are you referring to? Dark Devotion? Hex: The Third Seal?
---
Apply directly to the forehead!
---
The youruber is "wow such gaming," I just saw his video the other day
---
God I wish I had green ping
---
69 upvotes...
---
awwww maaan
---
oh ok thanks for remind me :)
---
I literally carried my team, made it whole game and had exit almost open then got killed and nobody helped me
---
I don't understand the premise of no ed being such a bad thing. When I see it I just think to myself "oh shit! I gotta be careful!" It doesn't really feel that strong to me when I use it either due to the fact in order to insta down someone u have to hit someone which can be difficult with over half the roster of killers. On the other hand, when I'm rushing the last gen and the killers about to hit me and then I heal up and take off into the distance it's hard for me to not think to myself "wow this shits op"
---
This happens in any game with P2P servers.
---
oh yeah true LOL
---
Well that escalated fast
---
Many of the like
---
i feel like that’s more of a problem with dbd as a game and the winning condition than adrenaline itself
---
again, this isn’t about balance
---
I'm rank 2 killer atm and it's barely fun anymore.
---
It's not like I get shit on, I usually average 2-3 sacrifices but everyone at this rank is so meta focused and plays in a four stack. Going against 4 survivors who all have the same 4 perks, (provethyself, balanced, borrowed, decisive) and then throwing on a haddonfield offering is just simply unfun and exhausting.
---
Not only that, but I feel that recently my roommate is about to quit DBD because of how SWF matchmaking works. He's never been higher than a rank 12 killer and consistently gets put against a 4 stack where 2 are smurfing at 15-17 and 2 that are purple or red ranks.
---
I'm honestly probably biased so take my opinion with a grain of salt because I personally find playing survivor boring as hell, even with friends, I think my Claudette is rank 35 and nobody else even touched. 
---
This game is amazing when you play with people at your skill/perk level. But recently I feel like it's getting rarer to see that. Hopefully with this new chapter the influx of players and dedicated servers will fix this problem. 
---
Kill well and may your ruin spawn hidden
---
I’ll try and get them, I asked for the screenshot but he said the messages got removed cus he used forbidden profanity. But I’ll check to see if he at least has some of the messages.
---
don't progress ranks. really it's not worth it. the games get harder and harder with no extra rewards. I've been to rank 1 before for the achievement, the most toxic and sweaty time i've ever witnessed on dbd
---
\*Insert ye old COD Commando Perk meme here\*
---
Um no just cause you struggle with it isn't reason to remove it all together
---
I want a “fractured mori” offering(or some other name). That lets you mori only on deathhook.
---
Susie for sure is the biggest cutie, but Joey is the best/coolest Legion member
---
That you are being a whiny bitch about nothing! Holy fuck kid drop it.
---
Ghostface literally has a cosmetic set that's reflective silver and his other three are all bright primary colors or just straight up white
---
Am I allowed to do that here? I’ll just PM you guys.
---
I've suggested this exact same power for a killer based off of The Thing for like 2 years now lol
---
I don’t get this joke...
---
Maybe he recorded it
---
I have a program that auto records gameplay
---
That’s what I thought before he joined the evil ranks of Forknife.
---
Splinters are also hidden.
---
it a pic of the tv so it was taken with a camera
---
True this
---
We need to do what the community did with the demagorgon. Keep suggesting, and try to make it a reality
---
ah i see what you mean. maybe?
---
If I see any Nancy or Steve players I'll probably be letting them go the first few weeks
---
actually I tend to use it for hiding around the corner with it after I slapped a gen and I know they will be back
---
just turn a corner wait for their repair sounds and grab
---
my dad will nurse noed then blink into an unopened exit gate and wait for a sound
---
but camping is camping insidious or not
---
85
---
Not luck, it usually spawns there
---
84
---
I'm pretty skeptical about it, I just think it would be really damn hard for them to do that character adequate justice as a killer in an asym horror game. His powers and abilities are just so much greater than anything that's been in the game so far, hes almost as much of a god as the Entity is itself
---
Looks amazing, make a mori one with gf.
---
Everytime i refresh i get less, yay
---
Oh so you saw Nea?
---
Why do you want to derank?
---
You’re right. Time to ditch Joey for bb Susie
---
Hate it when that happens
---
Not gonna lie I jumped a little when you downed the bitch. Couldn’t see her so I didn’t expect it
---
what platform do you play on? turning off messages from people who aren't your friends is a must especially in games like these.
---
Ever tried 3 stacks of PWYF??
---
its usually new players who don't get how to play
---
its like blaming a new r6 player for throwing a stray grenade
---
they don't know better 
---
if they play survivor they die automatically
---
so killer is a learning point
---
so annoying lol.
---
OP I know Gary and I'd advise you to tread carefully. He's even more deranged + toxic than the average Nea main, I saw him facecamp a leatherface in the basement once for revving his chainsaw too loudly.
---
Let’s see!
---
Step 1: Pick wraith.
---
 Step 2: stand in a corner all game while invisible.
---
 Step 3: walk away to do something else. 
---
Step 4: Open the gates once all gens are powered. 
---
Step 5: rinse and repeat
---
Keep your dc rate under 30%
---
Git gud scrub
---
Yeah, that’s true. And there can’t be any adjustments really because most of the killers have powers that are usually balanced and they can’t really do much about Pennywise
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one who thought  mom nd no mither would make a great joke build
---
Emblem system as a whole is a big fail and they should of left it like it was 2yrs ago.  Original pipping system wasn't great but its better than this emblem system.   New emblem system is easier to pip than ever, all you had to do was not tunnel hence the bronze in hunting category.
---
Ghostface doesn’t suck.. he’s a lot of fun to me and you’ll do pretty well with him at yellow/green ranks
---
I meant escaping. Not the hatch.
---
Read the last panel with Samination’s wraith voice
---
I’d be yeeting my entire pc across the street through my douchebag neighbors window. Doc is already annoying enough
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cyj01o/adept_pig_is_this_currently_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If every single person doesn’t have Adrenaline, Dead Hard, DS and Borrowed Time it isn’t too bad. It’s these ranks you’re matched up against that are bad. 
---
Ignore the NOED haters, that’s borderline funny on huntress honestly.
---
This ^.  Do you take matches seriously anymore or do you just go on autopilot while complaining to yourself about bad teammates
---
yeah people like you don't help the community at all
---
Quit being mean, if you don’t like it don’t say anything.
---
These are both nerfs and don’t adresss any of the frustrating aspects of either perk.
---
I just don't find staring at my hands for longer than 3 seconds fun. Long stuns are bad design in any game.
---
No on ps4
---
There are multiple chases in a game. Each survivor on average has 2 chases. Just because you win one doesn't mean you'll win them all. Slugging is also a thing, wait till there's a hook that comes back up, if you let someone get to an area with 0 books available that's on the killer. Just how if survivors finish 4 gens and leave the closest 3 gens together, its their fault.
---
ah fuck i cant believe thieve done this
---
i said "most" are new
---
Is that an addon that lets you go forever? Or is that just how he is? I haven't played enough billy.
---
The amount of times I’ve fell for this as Killer is unholy. Especially since I play Nurse. I always predict they’re going for the window again and I consequently get hella confused
---
Agreed, but I think that's because of the game pass, didn't use to be that bad. Eventually the game passers will get better at the game
---
True
---
Rip you
---
I hate being in red ranks. So much.
---
Generator rushing is when:
---
It takes **80 seconds** to do a generator with no toolbox and only Good skillchecks, **70.4 seconds** (no toolbox, hitting Great for each of the average of six skill checks on a generator), **59.96 seconds** (brown/common toolbox, Greats), **52.57 seconds** (brown/common toolbox, Greats, the Resilience perk), **32.57 seconds** (brown/common toolbox, Greats, Resilience, Brand New Part), **27.01 seconds** (Engineer's Toolbox, Greats, Resilience, Brand New Part).
---
When it takes **320 seconds** to regress a generator from 99.9% to 0% or **176 seconds** with both Pop Goes the Weasel and Brutal Strength (even with two perks it takes **over twice as long to degrade a generator as it takes a perkless and itemless survivor to repair it**).
---
When Decisive Strike lasts **60 seconds**; letting a survivor with *any toolbox who can hit Greats* **repair a generator completely** and **still hit you with DS afterward** if you find them injured.
---
When Bloodlust takes **45 seconds** to max out, something deemed **required due to building loops**.
---
When it takes a survivor **120 seconds to die on a hook** and they have three perks to extend the already long (developer confirmed by proxy due to pallets getting reworked again) chases (Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time) on top of exhaustion perks (Balanced Landing, Lithe, Sprint Burst).
---
When **safe pallets are so extreme that the developers have them slated for another rework**.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It'd be ridiculous to suggest that every killer ever can chew through the entire map and all its pallets and chase survivors with their exhaustion perks over and over and over when even the most basic of skill sets (hitting greats and carrying a common toolbox) is three generators in **60 seconds** (no Ruin) to **70 seconds** (with Ruin).
---
And you start off trying to find them desperately, you're going to waste time patrolling generators they're not on, or get on only after you leave. It's very possible to waste 35-40 seconds patrolling and have four different generators already halfway done.
---
Rushing is when if you take 30 seconds to find a survivor, and those survivors have common toolboxes and can hit Greats, there are four generators already **halfway completed**.
---
That means you have to catch that survivor in 46 seconds (the first three generators pop in 30 seconds, the fourth one takes 16.6 if they 3-man).
---
**Any degree of coordination from the survivors means you have 46 seconds to chase the first survivor you find, hook them, and chase the other survivors off generators. Or four pop.**
---
Just like that, go have fun, enjoy playing Legion, or Wraith, or Huntress! If they delay you for 30 seconds then you've already **lost**.
---
I feel you...I'm a survivor who gets nasty messages from other survivors (never from the killer usually).
---
They’re testing to see if you are worthy of rank one.
---
That didn't really address my point at all. I'm just saying there's no benefit to increasing the time other than to make the game more frustrating for the killer.
---
Yeah I started playing on gamepass about 2 months ago, but I already felt right off the bat that camping is scummy, especially from my background of resenting those guys on battlefield who just sit at the edge of the map with a sniper with like 2 kills
---
Jokes on y’all. I am new and I’ll be buying piggy instead.
---
Mostly cause I haven’t watched stranger things yet and I like the stealth killers in their movies, and legion because they remind me of the shitty old Jeff The Killer creepypasta.
---
Bro it was obviously taken with an actual camera lmfao
---
So leaving it frustrating for the survivor is fine? Its almost impossible to get out of a chase with 3 seconds
---
not sure how long you may have been playing but it used to be worse. Granted it was mostly caused by a lap in the spawn perimeters in the game, which is still why it happens to this day, but they've severely tightened those perimeters in the last few major patches. I remember once playing a game as Doctor on Thomson's House before the Spirit patch and literally spawning in LINE OF SIGHT to a Meg less than 10 meters away. I let her go for want of her not DC'ing on me.
---
? how do they suck. no rules were broken. in valve's book, if you did it without editing game files, or without typing "sv_cheats" in the console, its not cheating. hell even macros etc are acceptable in general matchmaking
---
Honestly, who wants to play against an extended range doctor with Sloppy, Ruin and Pop?  No one that i ever seen.
---
Yeah camping just isn't fun, I can't see how someone could sit next to someone waiting for them to die, wheres all the actions?!
---
Then the killer goes and gets the other survivors, the only time people don’t save is when the killer is facecamping
---
i'd usually only face camp if the gate has opened and i hook someone with no reasonable chance of getting more survivors
---
On leatherface, hell yeah!
---
Its just a picture of a screen. Im just saying it couldve been recorded and he took a pic of the recording. I do that all the time when theres something that isnt on my screen long that i wanna get a good pic of
---
I think he can go forever
---
Why not a "halt progress" button that stops progress and prevents skillchecks, that way you can get off the gen without accidentaly triggering it?
---
Same as tunneling, I don't like that's shit when playing survivor, so why do it to someone else, especially with doctor, or make your choice
---
Dude. Sometimes survivors just want to die.  Like I will LITERALLY run at a killer, crouch, and look up. Especially if the game goes bad. 
---
*Just end my suffering damn it*
---
Valentines Day nurse (so pretty) or Hallowed Blight Nurse (so creepy and cool looking)
---
It could have gone better if you didn’t slug, not saying its a horrible play style but survivors will almost always dc in a situation like that.
---
Yeah exactly
---
Bruh you’re mass evolving
---
## bruh 💪😫😫👏👏
---
You can open the gate and drop him right at the edge to force him out
---
I don't see how a second chance at escape after already losing a chase is frustrating. There's a reason DS was changed. You shouldn't be rewarded after going down.
---
Potential waste of time though.
---
Stfu you Noed having ass biatch
---
It would be a cool cosmetic for the forth of july!
---
Myers - No Skins
---
Pig - Has a dark leather outfit and one outfit with a red shirt that is equivalent or darker to her default
---
Ghost Face - Has blue/red/whitish outfits, Trench coat outfit that turns the tassles a shiny silver color, and a black poncho with red symbol + demon mask
---
Wraith - Bunch of outfits, some noticeable (Shadow Stalker, Wax Warlock, Sleeping Hollow ((But Sleeping Hollow is cool as fuck so who cares)), two yellow uncomons) and some very dark/unnoticeable outfits (Weathered Scarecrow, Angel of Music, MOST of the Aberrations.
---
All in all there's really no reason to complain. Sure Wraith has some very distinct outfits that are easily spottable but the dude can turn invisible. It's fine. Plus cosmetics aren't even supposed to give an advantage (hence cosmetics). I don't play Wraith but I got Sleeping Hollow during the event and it's cool as fuck so if I play Wraith, I don't even care if they see me, in fact I WANT them to see me, the tall fucking dude with a hole in his chest and oozing out some orange experimentation liquid. THAT'LL SHIT THEIR PANTS.
---
What I expect is suggestive balance. The idea of “nerf this/delete this” is bad design when you should strive for a happy medium otherwise you just run the risk of needing everything until nothing feels fun to even play. Keep nerfing and deleting whatever’s meta until we have nothing left. 
---
I’m already aware of multiple people’s suggestions to noed and adrenaline. Both perks are sadly just products of the games fragile balance and the devs truthfully need to assess the core issues of the game and look at either adding certain perks/addons into the base game and remove other perks entirely because eventually the devs are going to run out of actual perks to make or just have more powercreep the existing stagnated meta. 
---
Or we just nerf the bad noed perk cause incentivizing survivors to do totems has gone so well we needed three perks, an item and addon, two bloodpoints increase buffs, and an emblem buff to practically beg survivors to cleanse full totems and they still don’t cause “Do Gen, no heal, get adrenaline” is what everyone wants to do.
---
It seems strange to me you would bring up making a mistake i assume you mean missing a skill check is this a common thing? i cant remember the last time i saw someone miss a skill check and rank 1.
---
and your right carrying a surv to a hook is very easy that's not the hard part tho the chase is depending on what killer your playing and given how unbalanced some of the maps are it can take a while to catch a surv sometimes with borderline infinites and un mind gamble loops.
---
sure they reward you for to different things but id say they have alot in common.
---
both make you play with 3 perks till end game
---
both activate on gen completion
---
both have the chance to do nothing at all 
---
both alter the health state of the surv
---
Personally i don't think noed is a very good perk i don't even use it on most killers the only killer i use it on atm is plague and that's not cause its good its cause its better then nurses calling or sloppy
---
Because he is a cool toxic kid.
---
That’s a lot of questions, I main Nea, and doctor, am looking forward to prestige meg, and my perk build is: adrenaline, balanced landing, borrowed time and unbreakable
---
Clawdettface
---
Are we able to discuss mobile bugs?
---
Here is my theory 
---
That Leatherface is quite toxic and probably messaged you “gg ez” to Ben though he is insidious camping outside of the basement
---
You monstrt
---
Is wraith good then? I feel like his pressure is severely lacking
---
I didn't see her until I hit her lmao xD
---
Might make concept killer art of Jeff and Jake!
---
What did he say in endgame chat
---
I can imagine the salt

&gt;ghostface skins
---
&gt;subtle and dark
---
*Laughs in two bright red sets, one bright blue set, and one silver set.*
---
Thank you!! They will come soon!
---
Honestly, I use to main doctor on PS4 and got soooo many DC’s! Doctor noises are annoying as hell... ugh... now I switched to PC and I main ghostface and just fool around. It’s funny seeing the survivors try Harding and thinking their awesome, when all I wanna do is teabag and sneak scare them like a goof XD 
---
Try not to let the game get to you and just have fun :)
---
Same, 2.8k hours. I ALWAYS run bt and will go for the late game save no matter what. It definitely is the most enjoyable part of the game.
---
Meanwhile P3 Ghostface pretty much can't be seen on some of the darkest corners of The Game.
---
I enjoy playing as Myers more personally
---
I'm not sure it will look good in game, but it looks really cool imo in this render.
---
You can’t really genrush killers with high map control because they can pressure the gens. Trapper cannot. Its not an issue that can be fixed so all that can be done is to punish survivors for not rescuing more. You lose more points in the benevolent emblem if a survivor is left to die on hook could be a good fix. Similar to how they “fixed” farming by adding the safe rescue to the benevolent emblem.

&gt;gen jockey 
---
Wat
---
His lack of chasing power is his biggest weakness.
---
His tracking is great especially with his ebony add ons but he has nothing to help him win chases
---
&gt;Eh, someone else will probably get them
---
-Me, 2019
---
Alternatively
---
&gt;they probably have adrenaline and will thank me when this gen is done.
---
I main survivor now, usually playing as Meg, and I love playing with people who use altruistic builds. Of course I like being stealthy but I generally will always take a hit for someone or if I unhook you in the killers TR I will stay behind to make sure they chase me. (I currently don’t have BT)
---
Make him PROPER invisible BHVR pls
---
myers is better, and he’s more fun IMO. so many different things you can do with him. get gen grabs in tier 1, crazily snowball in tier 3, not to mention how fun some of his addons are. 
---
you can’t really snowball with ghostface, and his addons don’t change his power too much. id go with myers if i was you
---
ruin for sure
---
It will only get better once the influx begins. I’ve had so many games now with interesting matchmaking that I’m ready to teach some players or help them from toxic teammates/killers.
---
Myers is more fun imo but Ghost face is probably better.
---
you took someone else’s post an watermarked it as your own, nice job
---
Some of the killer backstory is good. Huntress and Plague are quite interesting. Wraiths makes no sense though and plays no role in literally any other part of him except his map and supposedly his weapon.
---
Matchmaking machine broke
---
Fired up, remember me, unrelenting, noed. Oh yeah, just as I planned, :))
---
Pretty much :/
---
No not nea :(
---
Myers
---
His power and addons provide a lot more variety.
---
GF's ability just sucks, It gets broken if a survivor happens to accidently look in tour direction. Myers dgaf.
---
Also up to certain people to not derank in order to bully new players.
---
How is Ghostface better?
---
Oooh Sweet Heart no!
---
yeah, noed is bad. we don’t need 100 posts about it each day.
---
I only made the meme 'cause I wanted to hear if anyone has had this problem alot more recently. My games have been good, but all of a sudden, I'm getting games where we're all rank 4 and the killer is rank 10. Or I'm rank 1 and the survivors are all around rank 16. I hadn't seen this in a long time, and I was wondering if matchmaking was jammed again.
---
Arent there add-ons to prevent the reveal from happening?
---
I love it!
---
I disagree, a Hag with Mint Rag, Thrill, and Devour can basically only be beaten by a SWF with exceptional communication. Any group of randos, even if they're all rank 1, will get demolished as soon as that third stack of Devour comes in. 
---
Hag is underrated imo.
---
Not Solidarity / 10
---
Say sike right now.
---
Lol
---
It does! His moldy electrodes are exactly what he needs, but I didn't want to ask for that to be base.
---
If you can switch between modes quick, you don't need help, but most players are trash with doc, and try to loop in shock mode the whole time.
---
Ah forgot about that.
---
To be fair, I did say I wasn't a high rank. So maybe I'll learn that eventually, but thanks for the warning
---
Lmao, not that good. Tbag after every pallet, wasted dead hard and stood at a pallet waiting for stun
---
I main Myers I would definitely go with him it’s kinda terrifying going against him because in tier 1 you never know where he could be and you could crazy jump scares and in tier 3 you can just power walk around 1 tapping people
---
I definitely can’t wait to have all the adept achievements. I currently only have 9. I love seeing Dwight’s in game, they are usually always really altruistic and will stick with you even in solo. I don’t have Dead Hard but I want it. I have 2 prestiged survivors who are both P2, (Feng &amp; Nea) I can prestige my Meg whenever but I’m saving up BP for Steve. I am not that good with the Clown, I prefer Freddy.
---
it was a poll from chinese players when dbd came to china I think? and most people suggested him so they picked him
---
Because its on console.
---
Yes but he didn't hook them, the main objective for the killer is to hook them
---
Yeah I play on console and my shit def doesn’t run at 25fps
---
His stealth is probably the best in the game, considering the dark outfit, ability to crouch, and ability to lean, while he can also do plenty of one shotting, just like Myers can. The issue is that Michael is an m1 killer even with 1 shots, and so is ghostface. However Ghost face can sneak up on you while healing, doing gens, etc. And one shot  them before they were able to get to a loop.
---
All are really good imo except for diversion. 
---
Prove thyself you can get from dwight.  I'd get ruin 100% and play with your food is good for the killers that are lacking.
---
That's what she said
---
1. Favorite survivor is Feng. Killer wise I enjoy playing as the Hag. 
---
2. Borrowed time, iron will, prove thyself, balanced landing is usually my go to perk build. I love doing meme builds or runing head on as it's always fun when I manage to stun them with it. 
---
3. Prestiged Feng and Jane completely and working on Quentin.
---
4. I usually switch between Jane and Feng as I've got them p3 and almost all perks but sometimes I switch it up either for dailies or the fun of it. 
---
5. More steahtly as I suck at chases but I've been doing a bit of kyf with a friend trying to get better. 
---
6. All adept survivors. I used to just have the original four but decided to get the rest done though it definitely sucked at points.
---
He’s not.
---
Coming from a GF main.  I have more fun with him personally but he’s definitely very weak and his trainables are fairly bad
---
One perk rewards losing, one perk rewards winning. That's literally the whole premise of each perk, the whole argument between the 2 perks is commonly they are considered crutches that reward you for bad play, difference being I don't see how completing all gens is "bad play" on the survivors' part.
---
You'd regret it to be honest. Ruin is incredibly strong and sometimes a necessity for builds. 
---
You won't be fighting new players forever and they have to learn to hit skill checks like everyone else or at least learn to find the totem.
---
Yea you got nice points of view. One time i didnt realise GF was still chasing me cuz he had his NS on.
---
R O U N D I N G
---
72hrs where you at
---
What did he say in chat?
---
It's ok
---
All are really good except for diversion imo. 
---
Prove thyself is free.  Ruin is basically needed.  And play with your food is great for killers that are lacking.
---
Does NOED affect it in anyway? Like now I’d have to use two totems
---
The one where he picks a survivor up and blocks the gens is pretty cool.
---
Ah yes, how dare I not love to be able to be one shot from across the map. Such a sin on my part to not hate actually playing the game.
---
But dont get me wrong, there are moments where Michael can be unstoppable.
---
It could be the influx already beginning, but I’m sure once the DLC releases, it will just burst open. Can’t remember the last time when a franchise as big as Stranger Things took this game by storm. Everyone and their dog loves Stranger Things and will probably crash the servers on DLC release. Once dedicated comes out shortly after, there will probably be even more people consistently playing as they won’t have to worry about laggy killer hosts.
---
I’m not bad unless it’s only tbags who throw the pallets down for everyone else
---
This is oddly specific yet entirely relatable
---
What’s funny is that deathgarden is the most alive one out of the three and it was made by BHVR 
---
Poetic irony
---
Myers is better in almost every aspect.
---
Leaning and crouching doesnt really do much if you just give em a little stare and then they become an M1 killer. Myers also has much more variety and is better overall
---
I'm sorry, little one
---
Where’s the shitpost flair
---
If I'm understanding you correctly, you should have no problem running both. Totem perks don't conflict, they just light up other totems.
---
It’s really the only perk out of the 3 worth running until you find something better.  You may be able to make a build with it but I haven’t found it worthwhile with how I play
---
Fallout New Vegas, Caesar’s Legion, it’s a quote from the random trash NPCs in that faction.
---
Yeah. Ok ty and I’ll be sure to buy it
---
A good hag is nasty my dude.  And I can tell you they definitely won't be getting ran around by you, any hag that chases like a normal killer is not a good hag.  If they set up properly they can snowball really hard.
---
Personally I have thought a lunging killer has been needed for a while (but I'm a newish player). I think the lunge should be an instadown attack, but that's just me.
---
I'm also a killer main and I think that Demogorgon's perks are WAY OP. So are Steve's, for that matter.
---
As for the teleport, I'm indifferent toward it. Like you said, it's situational, and I don't see myself using it often.
---
IF she was added grace would be a solo survivor pack
---
There were no recognisable killers In ready or not
---
That is one category.  If he lost chases and they were able to do all gens and heal then he lost 3 emblems.
---
Feng was my first prestige survivor. She’s literally the cutest. Hag is my #2 although I used to heavily play Trapper in the beginning. 
---
Head on looks really fun, I don’t have Jane but I usually spectate matches after I die and I’ve seen so many good plays with Head on. 
---
I’m also not the best at being chased, it’s really a gamble for me. Sometimes I can run the killer around for 1-2 gens and other times I go down a few seconds after getting caught. That’s really awesome that you have all Adept survivors!!
---
Although I hate it ruin is the way to go
---
I had a legion do it to me when I refused to leave
---
What? He didn't slug. The 2nd guy obviously disconnected because it lagged when he was downed. Also don't make excuses for survivors being pussies
---
2017 called, they want there complaints back
---
you are closer to losing when gens are finished yes, that's like the definition of it. Just as survivors are closer to losing when 1-2 are dead and the others are on death hook, doesn't mean they still don't have a chance to escape.
---
If you're playing a nice killer then that's on you I guess. If you're constantly reaching the end game stages as killer then well that doesn't exactly mean you're doing good, admittedly it can't be helped in some matches true, but if it happens as often as you're making it sound then yes it means you're losing lol. Doesn't mean you lost though, there's a difference between losing and lost.
---
not even close, come back when a rank 1 matches with 4 rank 20s.
---
Removed for oversaturated content
---
90%? And you know this how?
---
Lmao are you joking? Hitboxes are not the issue (for the most part) Its the de-sync that comes with peer to peer. Why do you think Window hits, Hell even hits in general feel much. MUCH better on 50 ping then they do on 300?
---
It does tho ... if you can grab 2 perks per bloodweb
---
Spirit with prestiege katana, school uniform and geisha hair
---
With range addons she can teleport significantly further. With clone duration addons she’s dangerous to loop as she doesn’t have to teleport right away if she doesn’t want to, blocking off pallets pretty effectively when used well. Easy to understand, difficult to master and extremely rewarding.
---
You got dis
---
It was obvious they were dc'ing. Picking them up would just be pointless.
---
Reread what I even said, then try again.
---
That's right, with the right combo you can have 5 totems lit up and really mess with survivors heads. 40% chance they trigger your HG.
---
Tf was first doctor's hit? Why didn't he hit ash?
---
Pretty sure this was me and my squad! Xbox? Couple days ago?
---
mettle of man i think
---
Thx, found them over there at /r/PerkByDaylight
---
Regarding perk 3: EGC is already killer sided enough, no need to run that
---
Camping is considered toxic because you more or less just sit in front of the hooked person and make it impossible for them to escape even if they get unhooked, but that's not what's important here, what important is you're hurting yourself by camping. When you hook camp you basically leave all the other gens open, free to be rushed through since you're putting no pressure on them. Instead of sitting next to a hook and waiting for someone to save, leave the hook to patrol gens and find a new survivor to chase, otherwise you'll never get many kills at all. Your way of thinking is basically camp and do only that since you haven't tried anything else to see if it works or not.
---
I can neither confirm nor den-
---
“FBI OPEN UP”
---
no idea then, i can’t think of anything
---
\+Respect
---
That's what I like to see lol
---
Had one recently, we were all R13-11 versus R20 killer. I got hit once and that was it for the match. We all escaped. I immediately sent GG to the killer and told them that it would get easier as they played more and leveled up their character. I felt real dirty after that match.
---
The patch to stop people from getting stuck in pallets is working well, I’d say.
---
The first survivor to dc is the one to blame, the rest just doesn't want to play with a massive disadvantage.
---
So close, yet so far away.
---
at least Wraith has a dapper suit,  black suit is good at times
---
If I had to take a guess, it’s probably the tactics that you’re using. It’s normal to get a toxic player once in a while, and it’s a known issue in the community, but based on what you’re saying they seem to be getting upset even when they all escaped. It could be they’re just unhappy with how they feel the game is unfair or feel cheated out of a game after being killed quickly. Might need some more information. Could you go into more detail about your play style?
---
Shit quality because I’m a pleb console player and I have absolutely no idea how I would go about getting an actual screen capture onto reddit as I am not tech savvy. Again, this killer wasn’t bad and played some pretty nice mind games, got us all in the end actually! Though I never was allowed off that hook afterwards :(  )
---
You appearently give a shit.
---
 I've had it happen. People can be really dumb.
---
Flaired wrong, this is a meta build, this build is so op not even rank 1 survivors use this build. If you wanna be a cunt while using this build, bring both insta heal add ons on a purple med
---
I know....I know.... Villains is spelled wrong.

Moving on...

---
I don't collect calm add ons for the Mr. Worldwide doc.
---
You can do a daily and then not claim it.
---
Just go check the other gens and return only if they have been rescued you will most likely see the marks anyway and can follow them...
---
Spirit
---
"Situational" Eh?
---
You hook someone, plant a portal at that hook or near the hook, you look for other survivors or whatever, person gets saved and warp right back. That would pair extremely well with Make Your Choice. Let's say you have Surveillance and watching a gen, it goes back to Yellow, you can teleport right back and hopefully catch them off guard. 
---
That's not "situational" that's all around useful. That's like saying placing a trap at a hooked survivor with Hag is situational.
---
Is it because you can’t figure them out or you just always lose to them
---
and you have no case at all :)
---
Wraith with the candle wax factory accident skin.
---
Stepping on him in the mori like an insect seems very appropriate
---
Don't really care for Legion but their theme is awesome as fuck
---
But no, jendenise plays. She’s not toxic and super respectful /s
---
Perhaps it was misspelled as BPS, which stands for bloody party streamers.
---
Good job!
---
I'd be good with that. As long as it's a cool mesh
---
Spirit with prayer beads is very tough to survive
---
The frick you mean, I said I had fun, without /s, I live destroying sweaty swf nerds
---
Is it really fun to play as ?
---
Legion is "veteran"...
---
This is actually cool lol
---
Get 4 iridescent on Plague for your next challenge
---
Yeah...I can see how they might not like that, it is effective at lower ranks though. It won’t work as well at higher ranks. At higher ranks they’ll be more likely to just continue doing generators. If I had to guess, the reason why they don’t like your play style is because they think you’re robbing them of the chance to save a teammate from dying early, which ends up pissing off the person on the hook and the person saving them. 
---
   A tactic that I found works just as well is patrolling other gens until you hear the unhook notification, then going to the hook. The reason is if they know you aren’t by the hook, it’s more likely that they’re going to send someone out, which means one less person completing objectives, slowing down generator repairs. This gives both sides more time to play the game, which equals more fun for both sides. They get to save their teammate and have a good chase and you get more time to hunt survivors. It’s a win win.
---
Why? Because fuck Blendettes that's why and survivors that disappear into the void at will.
---
Had a game today, where I intended to hook everyone 2 times before endgame, then bloodwarden them in and Mori them...
---
When they all blocked a hook and teabagged me midgame, I turned up the heat and took 2 of them out immediately.
---
The block was fine, but the taunting wasnt cool. I play to the survivors. If they want sweat, I'll put on the workout mixtape.
---
Wow megs been eating her wheaties
---
Imagine getting this worked up over a game.
---
096's power would work best in the game.
---
Hey (:),  heard u play on xbox and r askin for sentient teamates...
---
Honestly it would be cool to have killer/survivor voicelines like that
---
it's so he can makes your machine slower by requiring more graphics power for the mask alone. **taps head**
---
Lolwut
---
i count 4 different teachables all at tier 3. seems to me like you dont belong in green ranks.
---
By finding chest ? Yes ! By increasing the item value ? No !
---
At least the GG's were more numerous. Enjoy the small things.
---
Wish there was a bot to Jean-Ralphio this comment
---
i usually do it when I'm out of options );
---
true. But he would need to be looked at.
---
does that matter?
---
With the new character rig they could easily do SCP-96.
---
Shaking your head is the killer equivalent of teabagging. Don’t do it.
---
How "situational" is it to HOOK A SURVIVOR? You fucking schmuck. Is getting hit situational? Is dropping a pallet situational? Is doing a gen situational? Next you'll say using BBQ with Billy to get to a gen being worked on is situational. Be quiet. Stand in the corner wearing a dunce cap.
---
Rank 5 been rank 1 many times. Ive never had this much of a fucking issue. Even with ruin i cant get and sacrifices.
---
Good to see some of the Jedi escaped order 66.
---
I mean spirit in the sense of most challenging, but the actual most annoying is legion.
---
I mean at least with a spirit, you'll be dead quickly. Legion isn't hard to face but drags the game on forever
---
But the wiki says
---
&gt;Grants a considerablybetter chance at finding an Item of a higher Rarity from Chests
---
I just got the game back after being locked out of my account for 2 weeks because of an initiation error, and I had a daily for a killer I don't have many add ins for and Immediately played against 3 red ranks and a rank 18, I was at rank 17. I literally just quit playing for the rest of the day, and I was so excited ot have my account back as well.
---
like I said, there's a difference...between losing and lost. It's like you completely ignored that, I never said "gens are done, survivors now win and killer loses"
---
Also this isn't 2 months ago, Freddy isn't the best example here. There's a reason people automatically start assuming you're running NOED once you start making bad plays, you aren't confident in killing fast enough that you gotta get that extra buff after you start LOSING to either secure the last 1 or 2 kills or in worst case scenario, secure at least 1 kill so it isn't a complete wash.
---
?
---
Nothing's a motto with me
---
(I'm sorry...)
---
Just to be grabbed by the entity
---
1mil gets you to like 37, so I'd say just go for 1mil
---
Yeah this meme only loses from including that.
---
Breaching on homicide at this point
---
Ugh, playing Killer is so hard.... even Beads+Bracelet spirit and omega blink nurse can’t get me through yellow ranks.... this game is so unbalanced and survivor sided.... smh.
---
/s
---
Depending on how well you can get through bloodwebs, probably anywhere between 700k-1 million
---
It's because matchmaking is having an aneurysm right now
---
What is PTB?
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one. Picked this game up a couple months ago but the lag lately has been insane. Worst was yesterday I got matched with a killer from mainland China and I'm in California. It was a bad time.
---
You must be one of those tawksik people I've heard so much about.
---
Go use a flashlight on a killer that's kicking a pallet and I'll go and do the things I enjoy doing and hopefully we never cross paths again.
---
The first one made me chuckle aswell but when claudette joined i felt like the other one isnt as funny anymore :/
---
Who shit in your cereal
---
Everything but the Leatherface. Everyone else is ok. Legion is pretty meh though you can skip him too if you want.
---
That’s right. That’s me, baby
---
Ur right . I am kinda suprised i over looked this part of the perk .
---
This is awesome! Great job :D
---
I dont complain about a lot when it comes to it. Theres a decent balamce between both sides. But there is no reason anyone should be able to get from one pallet to the next in 3 seconds. And no reason should there be 2 to 3 pallets wothin 15 meters of each other. Thats just begging for instamt gen rush looping wins. Even if i do leave them amd chase someone else, i get to them an get the same bullahit 3 loop crap.
---
Sorry, there's just many of these posts now complaining about matchmaking and it's just clogging the subreddit. Starting to get annoying
---
Thank you I do plan to have a fully written chapter done. I am taking ideas for perks.
---
Maybe it’s the only perk he had available.
---
Put your head in a bucket of water and breathe
---
Uh huh
---
Imagine the map being a big combo of all the scp containment chambers. SCP-914's containment chamber is the basement.
---
Well if you really want to grind to rank 1. Get yourself a swf and tell them to keep the heat off you while you get 2 gens (minimum) and 2 saves (minimum) this *should* get you a pip. Unless they changed it
---
I can imagine having a meeting with The Entity;
---
Entity: What the hell was that?
---
Legion: I let Steve and Nancy live because it's their first time.
---
Entity: YOUR ENTIRE PURPOSE HERE IS TO KILL THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
---
A Simple Trick would make the "Narnia Juke" an actual thing and that sounds hilarious,
---
Already did it was too easy
---
We -do- need this lol, was playing doctor earlier, and lemme tell you. Finding a Quentin in a locker? Absolutely terrifying xD
---
Do you know if it's the only one that has such an effect?
---
Fuck you dad you don't own me!
---
Get good. Practice. Watch ussylis, otzavarda, and demi on YT. Idk what to say

Nice

Michael is super fucking tall with his bright ass mask but that isn't the problem it's mostly ghost face with his bright ass cosmetics that impact gameplay
---
F
---
What con are you going to? Btw, I absolutely adore the mask!!
---
Okay so this guy isn’t helpful at all lmao don’t even think of this. This isn’t what is frustrating or true about survivors at all.
---
*gong noise*
---
Player test build. It’s a early access server for pc users to test out the new dlc
---
I'm kinda new to the game. I've only had it a few months. The community was kind enough to me when I started, so I'll do my best when the dlc drops.
---
Bubba is solid on Mobile. Same with trapper and Doctor
---
nodding and hook hitting are worse imo
---
360s are easy to counter, just stand still when they spin, or put your sens to 100% so you can moonwalk as killer to hide your light.

Salt Lake FanX. Thank you!

As far as I'm aware two buttdance crouches and not immediately pointing or running are acceptable for acknowledging/getting the attention of a player in a non toxic way. It's usually used as a greeting or acknowledgement on PlayStation at least.
---
Yeah it should be from the killer’s perspective
---
Guys i dont wanna use ruin but what else am I supposed to use to slow down the game? I don't have pop on my pig, I only have corrupt intervention but that doesn't help it doesn't block off the 3 Gens, there are still Gens far away that are left out in the open!
---
My current build for pig is bbq, brutual, enduring and bamboozle, I am rank 8 getting 2 kills every match with brutal killer, can anyone help?
---
If I were Pig in that match I would have joined the line haha

Most likely this guy broke his mouse and keyboard in frustration after being downed like that.

Is it just me or does the huntress look like the xenomorph from Aliens
---
I like the meme but I really don't like how everyone is targeting streamers. I met some really nice people who advertised in their name.
---
Spirit is hard?????
---
I would love to come and live in your parallel universe!
---
Yes but emblem system is still broken. I had instances that I depiped after three kills on hook. Or depiped as survivor after sucessufull escape because killer was looped by one other survivor whole game. There should be some minimum like two kills on hook or escape should mean safe pipe.
---
And that's how you get ran around by a swf
---
It’s all the same. It’s toxic, it makes this game shitty
---
Lets be honest, ash should have gotten hit at that pallet.
---
You need friends that body block you, not sandbag you. LOL
---
Wholesome
---
2 kills per match is fine, don't shoot for a 4k and just try to improve. You'll go crazy trying to 4k every match since this game isn't designed for it.
---
As for a perk I'd suggest corrupt intervention.
---
I didn’t record it sadly, just imagine your normal toxic survivor, but typing in all caps and going LOLOLOLOLOLILOL LMFAO BAD SO BAD I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU
---
Balance, Adrenaline, Borrowed time, Unbreakable
---
Sprint Burst, Iron Will, Decisive, Bond
---
Dead Hard, Self care, Prove Thyself, Urban Evasion
---
Lithe, Spine Chill, Deliverance, Distortion
---
I mean i don't like OP's idea, but to say its impossible to come up with 4 viable builds is bullshit.
---
It's matchmaking's fault. Also really unlucky he was the obsession.
---
Mobile isn't even out yet. You're pulling this stuff out of your ass.
---
Sprint burst
---
Dead hard 
---
Lithe
---
Balanced landing
---
Adrenaline 
---
Hope
---
And probably a few more
---
Depends on the context, did it happen at the start of a chase?
---
Imagine how embarrassed the chick with him is.
---
There's currently a bug going around that matches your description, though I've only heard of it activating randomly and affecting single Survivors. Maybe someone found out how to trigger it and they were abusing it?
---
If you really like being able to quickly go after a previously hooked survivor (you'll always get salt for that) you may wanna try the hag. Sometimes I do slimey plays with her, if a group is annoying or brain dead. She gives that extra security of quickly teleporting across the map since most survivors don't bother crouching through the trap radius and some of her add ons can make for good spooks.
---
You need 10 CC's of git gud stat.  This is an infantile suggestion.
---
It increases the amount of blood points earned per match in the given time
---
Survivors: Takes 20 seconds to open exit gates.
---
Killer: *TWHACK*
---
There are plenty of red ranks guys that can win those games. Actually FunGoose wins the majority of his red ranks games.
---
I'm not saying SWF does not give an edge, but the Killer still has a decent fightning chance.
---
But have you seen those SWFs face a poor yellow ranked killer? Yes it happens, and yes those games are truly ugly.
---
Yeah i dont want a 4k its just that my gate keeper is so trash I am not pipping up atleast I want to be rank 7, but let's say if I am playing a lethal killer like sprit or huntress I am pipping, it's so hard to rank up as piggy without ruin. I am legit thinking of sacrificing two perk slots for thrill and ruin just to protect it for some time
---
Amen
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/WnRxv
---
Same thing for me, mori daily, got him down and he dc'ed then added me and put like 10 pages of shit on my profile lol... he was VERY upset.
---
This is somethin iv always thought of
---
Okay, go play trapper (for example) at Red ranks without ruin against a 4 man swf. Tell me how you do
---
in theory speed hack exist but its super rare doubt u would ever see 4 guys run it.
---
I am a green rank killer and yes i have been victim of what i am describing. I faced red ranks SWF and got destroyed. That's what they need to fix in priority.
---
But as for trapper being unable to compete, again, go watch FunGoose. He crushes plenty of red ranks with Trapper. (me, personally, i am not close to FunGoose's skill level)
---
*ThIeR
---
No, they were just able to move really fast. They all had similar names so I'm assuming they're in a group so that always helps but the speed just confused me
---
Wouldnt the entity be fine with this though. Since giving them escapes will be giving them hope , which the entity can feast on at a later date
---
I heard someone say glitch
---
Maybe so I didn't know there was a bug like that. They all had similar names so I'm assuming they were in a group so maybe so
---
Im never prestiging again. I already had tier 3 iron will on jakey parky, but now at lvl 44 iron will is still tier 1.
---
I heard the doctor laugh for some reason
---
I know fun goose, I've faced him a couple times as a solo queue survivor, you do know people only post games they win right.
---
why don't you get tf outta here?
---
Used it on nurse. I was big brained since it would reduce the time on the missed attacks after blinking so the fatigue would come earlier.
---
get your negative dumb b!tch a$$ outta here why am I censoring cause the trash auto mod removes it
---
I personally am complete trash at looping but every-so-often I run into a killer that is not the best and I am able to out loop them for some time and then when they finally catch me. It's game over.
---
Maybe so. I was just really confused lol
---
I just got my mask in for Halloween too! yours looks sick, what did you use to do the blood?
---
i CAN ONLY IMGAINE THE SALT, IT ALMOST GAVE ME KIDNEY STONE
---
Imagine being you.
---
Do the tutorial and watch youtuber s
---
Shut up already dude, unless u can come up with a way to make it completely balanced WITHOUT being biased then ur ideas won’t make sense
---
That's me right there. Sometimes I  waste 1 or 2 minutes, and they punish me severely like I'm some kind of threat XD
---
Well sorry didn’t know you had done it more than one time, you can allways contact support
---
Are you accualy wondering why? Or like do you need a explanation
---
Because of mouse speed can do it :(
---
The way you start this off sounds like the classic defending of fuck you I'll camp and tunnel if I want to kind of stuff.  I hope it's inaccurate because those turds ruin the community but that's definitely what that talking point typically signifies.
---
How is it biased in any way and not balanced in any way. Give me one example where survivors having all different perks would make them majority weaker
---
"Sorry for camping but I was mad"
---
I hear that every-so-often when it happens. *Shrug*
---
I woulda just dc'd
---
The Nurse is undisputedly the best, with many considering the Spirit 2nd and Hillbilly 3rd. All 3 take a lot of practice to get good at tho. 
---
Yes, technically the Nurse is the slowest, but she can also blink, which gives her insane map pressure
---
Yea, I have noticed that too, a LOT of people from Japan and Korea are in my lobbies, its so odd
---
But then I don’t get the points. I got 20k
---
I only ask that you don't do it against NOED.  The last thing those people deserve is another free kill.
---
Maybe one of the survivors is running: adrenaline, balanced landing, sprint burst, and lithe cause its his baby bro playing, wtf are the other survivors gonna put for exhaustion perk?
---
If you look at the perks you can see it has no charges so it wouldn't have taken the hit, I think survivors get I frames after getting off the hook for a bit and a Kobe might be a tad longer on those frames but idk
---
Git gud
---
Yes, technically the Nurse is the slowest, but she can also blink, which gives her insane map Pressure
---
They're too young to read "***The Survivors rulebook for Killers***"
---
What a gentleman.
---
That's not what OP is posting about though. He's talking about how he finds NOED unencouraging to become a better player and it rewards bad play, whereas he finds it the opposite with adrenaline.
---
Trust me. Im rank 17 when try spirit and after 15-20 games i can feel better. And watch utuber play her. U can learn too much. I suggest truetalent ( cant remember spell )
---
1. Why would he be playing in swf
---
2. Why wouldn't his sad sat anything about it
---
3. Why doesn't the older sibling change their perks
---
4. Who says you NEED exhaustion perks, there are still plenty if good perks.
---
It’s just a shit idea in general, ppl would leave games a lot more than now, a lot of players would stop playing, queues would be longer, everyone would want to main killer, just makes the game unfun
---
Now now Dwight did you tea bag him and click him the whole game?
---
And the important thing, did he tea bag back?
---
You are not the first or the last to have this idea. My version was hour episode. First 30 minutes is killer and last 30 is survivor! Show all the time before they were taken and then have special episodes of killer vs survivor where we see the killer or survivor winning
---
Exactly, and tbh both sides can be equally as toxic not just the survivors as well as whiney. Heck I recall plenty of posts on here and of ppl getting messages or ranting about "toxic" survivors looping them or just simply surviving xD. Anyway getting off topic, PrincessofRain is right. And there's been a few ppl comment on here that told u plenty of what u should do. Just patrol gens, and put pressure on them. It results in more fun for all.
---
Just want to let u know that the swf its already pretty much shit because of all the killers using OP addons and perks on killers like Freddy and lagging like a bitch, and u want to nerf it when this happens 50% percent of the time?
---
Right. But bbq&amp;chili and nurses help you finding people, which you would do with or without the perk. Bamboozle helps you with chasing survivors, which you would do with or without the perk
---
What I said is that the experience is shit not that it balances the game, ur “balance” would just make it shittier and make more players leave
---
Dull And Rainbow Keys makes the hatch close mechanic useless and hatch spawns at any gen left now
---
Rainbow maps can show hatch, totems, hag and trapper traps, and everything else. 
---
If you think BNP is OP than I'm done with this comvo
---
I know that's why I'm moving to China
---
I stream and play dbd. That being said I am terrible at the game! But i just love it so much! I will get better or die trying!
---
The other questions make much more sense for the example provided by yourself. You just don't have an answer for them
---
I play killer when I can't find a game as survivor. 4 People connect fast.
---
I usually shake my head up and down and wait for them to spin and then I drop em' in
---
Doc kinda deserved that
---
u/chattywindows did the good Quentin edit I think
---
Have you even seen the movie?
---
Again, most killers aren't laggy, also they don't balance around lag, no game does that so you can't use that argument. If you want to leave then leave, we are gonna get an influx anyway with the ST chapter
---
Different problem: someone said i was camping as ghostface when I went back to the hook to get the person that unhooked immediately 
---
they dc'd when i jumped on their face when they were in the basement
---
Not good ones which red ranks are.
---
Hatch spawns with a certain amount of gems done, 4 players=make 3 gens, 3= 2gens 2= 1 gen
---
1= 0 gens, so no, I don’t believe the skeleton key is OP and map only have 20 seconds of use so they aren’t gonna use it the whole match
---
What the fuck
---
13k players worldwide. Perhaps your region doesn't have enough players for fast queues.
---
What’s even ur point? How is swf OP? Like I don’t get how it is OP
---
Yea, can agree. Especially now that I broke My laptop screen, so I have to play on PS4 --- It absolutely sucks.
---
Hatch spawns no matter how many gens are done for the last survivor
---
Rainbow key with addons is something you forgot about
---
Obviously for last survivor, but hatch is OPEN for last survivor u forehead
---
One time I was running from a Myers but I ran into a dead end... he fully stalked me and I basically screwed my team
---
That’s why I put 1 = 0 gens
---
Then this convo is over, you simply aren't as expiernced as I am
---
What rank are u?
---
You also know survivors drop keys on death meaning the last survivor as long as they have a key will survive
---
Some Survivor Tips 
---
-Do gens as much as you can 
---
-dont attempt escape on hooks your team will get you 
---
-dont be toxic 
---
-A audio que will happen before a skill check on a gen
---
-help people off hooks as often as possible take a hit if you can 
---
-Dont dc you will lose pip,blood points, and your rank maybe. (pip is the stuff that ranks you up)
---
-if you're playing meg and have sprint burst DO NOT RUN AFTER YOU MISS A SKILL CHECK ON A GEN!!
---
-a hatch will spawn after 3 gens are done if you have a key you can escape 
---
-do all 5 gens and you will have to find a exit gate or the the last tip^
---
-do your daily rituals to earn blood points 
---
-all survivors have teachable perks that can be unlocked for other survivors once you hit level 30 on any character 
---
-max level for survivors is 50 
---
-play with the survivors and find some you like 
---
-the ranks go backwards thats why you start at 20 and have to work your way down 
---
-learn to 360/juke 
---
-use pallets to stun the killer 
---
-use flash lights to blind the killer (the flash light is picky some times)
---
-the pig will put a reverse bear trap on your head look for a thing with a puppet on it (dont know the name of them)
---
-freddy puts you to sleep find a dresser with a clock on it to wake your self up (a survivor can do this but it alerts the killer)
---
-there are crates around the map that have toolkits,maps,medkits,etc in them (you can escape with it a you will earn it) 
---
Some Killer Tips 
---
-dont tunnel 
---
-dont face camp (proxy camp is a acception)
---
-if their are 2 people left and one is downed dont kill the downed guy a hatch will spawn and the other guy can escape 
---
-DONT BE TOXIC 
---
I dont play killer much 
---
Thats all i got for you if u have any questions message me on xbox 
---
Zombiemuss106
---
He plays killer most of the times wtf.
---
Rank 1 on both sides, I have over 900 hours on this game
---
Bruh, HATCH IS OPEN FOR. LAST SURVIVOR, WHAT U R SAYING IS STRAIGHT UP DUMB
---
Which goes back to my point of it makes hatch closing a useless feature forehead
---
What should the gals get?
---
Please show me the ways sensei
---
I am rank 7 piggy getting brutual every match, please send help
---
Which goes back to my previous point, it makes hatch a useless feature.
---
People who work with the killer and get their entire team killed should honestly be banned. I had a game with a Jake timing Jeff's one perk (lets you see survivors auras if you heal them or they heal you) and he led the killer to all of us and got us all killed, then did all 5 gens, cleansed bones, etc.
---
It ruins the game for everyone else and makes ppl depip.
---
Nice, u play on pc I see, well u r right, perhaps the game might or might not be played differently on PC, anyways I believe the game is balanced as it is
---
At a boy! Change the subject so you don't have to admit your ignorance. Bravo! Round of applause! The victim card! Well played ol chap!
---
I play on console
---
Oh shit, how do u know the hours???
---
Wouldn't be more productive to look for guides on youtube? You even get to see gameplay instead of having to read tips and trying to imagine that in practice.
---
It does kill you, *if it's activated*.
---
The trap activates once a gen goes off. So if you get a RBT on you and the last gen pops, you need to take it off or go through hatch.
---
If all the gens are done and she puts a trap on you, it literally does nothing
---
Yes because it almost never happens that you wiggle free all by yourself. And so it gives more time to escape.
---
thought it was Ryuk for a second
---
Agreed
---
As long as the trap is placed on your head AFTER the last gen is powered, you can escape through the exit gates with it on.
---
You most likely had the helmet on before the gates were powered and left while the countdown timer was active.
---
Good luck, have fun, and don't take it personally if things don't go your way :)
---
I mean the more you play the better you should be (which is not always the case). Nothing more.
---
I might be wrong but I think I remember when he first came out that any vault you tried to do while intoxicated would be a slow vault, did they change that or am I just imagining that as a thing that happened?
---
Wait he's protecting another survivor? I always thought it 2as a guy littering for some reason lmao.
---
Darn
---
lets see what you look like behind that computer f@g
---
Bugs like this really grind my gears. Makes the game unplayable 🤪
---
Miss Jasmine Masters invading the gaming community? Shocked? No. And I Oop---
---
She's trying so hard to lay on that bed
---
I'm in Rank 16 so...
---
I know right?
---
# OH SHIT THEY'RE AFTER ME
---
Because you are a moron. Took me about 5 min of the first video I watched just to pass time to prove you wrong but for some stupid reason you continue to try and prove yourself knowledgeable. Just move the fuck on. You said it was this way and it's not. No big deal. Quit banging your head against the wall trying to say I'm mad or whatever you're even talking about now.
---
\*in Kim Kardashian's voice\* ***It's what she deserves.***
---
why MoM instead of Solidarity?
---
What? This isn't even totally broken matchmaking...
---
"wtf I thought I was the S tier killer"
---
As a fan of British culture, I find this... stunning.
---
Or maybe a trumpet
---
I would take ilya as a killer or survivor little big is a sweet band he is awesome
---
The killer is rank 20... and he forgot to put on perks
---
And there was a rank 8 in the lobby
---
SAWCON ;D
---
A rank 8 being in a match with low ranks isn't broken..
---
&gt;Would rather play an unbalanced match in an unbalanced game then not get to play at all...
---
Yes but this is you and I agree. The problem is, if you look at this sub for the past week there's been a post complaining about unfair matchmaking every 5 minutes or so. Most people don't understand how matchmaking works and expect to get 4 players the same rank as them every match. 
---
As for 13k worldwide being significant, Rocket League has a very similar population to DBD and also struggles with matchmaking.
---
I wish!! It's actually Salt Lake FanX.
---
I started a month ago it is possible As I’m rank 11 a lot of it for me was trial and error, The first thing I learned to do was looping a killer and mind gaming, it also helps with what perks you have, what build you normally run, honestly it’s not down to one thing just find out where you are failing and practice
---
Hahaha!
---
In the first pic she looks like she’s trying to touch god
---
He's gay too so I don't think he'd enjoy it very much.
---
I know that feeling, but I remember recently in a round, I bassicly spawned infront of the Totem, so it was like done in 15 seconds.
---
&gt;Nope. Why would they do that? Control is one of the few things The Pig has.
---
This is actually a thing, OP just misunderstood when he could walk past the exit gates with a trap on his head. The other comments explained the situation where you can walk out with a RBT on your head just fine.
---
I didn't know my blendette can go off!
---
also
---
made iwth mematic
---
Then what are they complaining about?
---
Do you want to play as the Pig with no perks or add-ons for one match? To test her?
---
If we gettin Tony Todd, he better be Candyman...
---
Looks like one survivor is still in game so it won't show killer perks and what not
---
Well now I feel bad because it's a SAWC ON this cock joke...
---
Yep clown you can just fire and forget near the pallet, Doctor requires very precise timing and even then it's so buggy/laggy that it doesn't stop the drop half the time
---
I don’t know? No perks seems no bueno. It doesn’t matter anyways. There are 5 cheap colognes and 3 chewed pens so like smh
---
They are complaining, but you said “bought and then complain” which is incorrect.
---
Really? Wow I actually didn’t know that but it seems somewhat useless when you can just play that killer you own
---
💁🏼‍♀️🌚
---
Scooby fucking dies.
---
oh ok, cool
---
Doc probably has the 2nd best 3 gen by a long shot, but if you're relying on what is at most a survivor dependent strategy (and at worst a gimmick), you're not gonna have a good time vs high ranked survivors. Tracking also doesn't mean much; most good killers should have absolutely zero problem finding survivors even if they're being "stealthy".
---
&gt;Really? Wow I actually didn’t know that but it seems somewhat useless when you can just play that killer you own
---
I found out by accident. 
---
It took me a while to buy the DLCs for Myers and Pig so I ended up with a bunch of their Splinters on my older characters. Decided to get rid of them after I bought the DLCs and that happened.
---
He attacc
---
He protecc
---
But most importantly
---
He's a dumb fucc
---
I think pig, while underpowered, is extremely fun to play, I'd recommend her
---
Sure!
---
Rn I got my mori and my ghost face ready lol
---
Its an offering that allows you to try a killer you dont have. If you want to try the pig go ahead, its always fun trying new killers
---
The newest killer chapter
---
are u a guy
---
Don't start with the nurse, while she is the best she has a higher skill floor than other players plus as she ignores the core chase mechanics of the game you'll pigeon hole yourself as you'll never learn how literally all other killers work (as she is so different).
---
My advice: if you are willing to spend money then choose Spirit, if not then choose Hillbilly. Then work on Nurse.
---
“This is,...Requiem.”
---
Glad someone said it
---
 Meg.
---
It radiates toxicity. Good work.
---
Even if half the playerbase was asleep thats still 6k remember how the earth rotates? Where the moon dawns the sun rises somewhere else.
---
Oh my god! Someone who doesn't farm for bp, takes a hit for the unhooked surviver, and blinded them to save them once again!
---
Even though I'm a killer main, I give you mad respect for that dude
---
I hate to break it to you. But that’s just your internet man.
---
None really, he's one of the most balanced characters and most fun to play against.
---
You seem to got issues though
---
I'm just saying any time you use a splinter, don't expect to win because you won't have any perks or addons. That's usually enough to do any killer in
---
Suicide is badass!!
---
150 is fair. 170 is like the most ill ready up for so 150 is probably the closer side.
---
That's what I use, but I chose it to look more classic lol
---
Oh ok
---
I was using the yellow rarity hairbrush and the green rarity jewelry box
---
I hate loopers, especially on Gideon meat plant because there’s literally no way around than just stomping pallets
---
Just use ruin if you like it, especially on weaker killers, seriously it's nowhere near OP on higher ranks because of how fast it gets destroyed. It gives you few seconds tho at least, if you're lucky even more.
---
I mean even Otz is using ruin + curruption on his Trapper when he's playing actually seriously, because it's extremely hard to rank up without slowing the game a little bit in the current meta.
---
Insidious Doc is best Doc
---
Nice art! Although a Darn... in the text bubble would have been more appropriate...
---
When I play killer ruin gets destroyed in 30 seconds, when I play survivor it takes forever before we find it...
---
I like to just put on their stream so I can listen to them chatting/reacting, I love to hear the streamer freak out right after I jumpscare them. 
---
I mean if you're just listening, it's not like it's stream sniping right? I'm not like trying to see where they are, but I could pick up little bits of info from things they say I guess. I just like to put the stream on in the background and then play like normal
---
Aaah man! Yeaaa! I love how salty you are keep it up!!
---
Then why do they care? Use the default. There are no cosmetics for Michael, The Wraith's don't matter since he's invisible when he's stealth, and the Ghostface ones only have coloured accents they are still mostly black.
---
I tried to once. It was great but I didn’t end up saving the guy. What happened was huntress was camping so as the sneak master Claudette I went behind her (she was walking around) and stunned her with a pallet while she wasn’t looking in my way. I wanted to stay and tbag if she came but my brother was antsy
---
I suggest NOED and Ruin because why not
---
My build is crows NOED ruin and I’m all ears
---
Pictures taken moments before a disaster
---
I saw the post as well. It probably got deleted, but I'll try find the video once I'm home.
---
oh so when you say it you get upvotes but when i say it im an unoriginal dickhead. cool.
---
If you want the 4K that badly, just slug the 3rd survivor and down the last
---
I have photo evidence I’ve had 69420 as well
---
Half the windows are just broken, it's not even ping.
---
No way man that's the Game Boy, sidekick of Mr Business.
---
Risk it, for the biscuit.
---
The more you play the better you get. If you play too much and you understand perfectly the mechanics of the game it can go in three ways:
---
1-You become bored with the normal gameplay and you become toxic to have fun bullying others. Some people are already toxic even without 1 or 2k hours but they usually complain if they get killed.
---
2-You become somewhat of a hero and you won't leave unless you make a play to save your buddy from a facecamping leatherface. With the experience you have you decide the best move to do at the right moment to carry the entire team.
---
3-You literally become the transcendental form of the dead by daylight meme. Burger king myers, heavy smoker nurse, sabo jake, pizza dwight...you play solely to make the memes alive.
---
And also you can become just a normal player that plays the game normally but that's somewhat rare.
---
That rank 20 should have vaulted the window behind him, tsk tsk.
---
Couldn't be more right. People need something to release their anguish on and in this case direct it at streamers who the majority are just trying to have a good time.
---
Big man doesn't care what people think about him.
---
Hey man, I know getting mean messages from Survivors really gets to you overtime... But don't give in man. 
---
You know what we do when they take the low road? We take the high road!
---
That isn't even relevant man the scenario was feeding into a killer with NOED already up and activated another kill going for a save just because.  But thanks for being typical.
---
I approve of this meme. Very appropriate.
---
Where did this format come from?
---
Object of Obsession, DS, Lithe and Borrowed Time are what I recommend.
---
Nice job
---
This would be the best DLC ever for this game if they made this happen.
---
I like how the character bows down to the mighty Feng
---
To be honest, I haven't heard an opinion anout Enduring after it became only pallet stuns. I felt that it was less regarded nowadays and seeing this it seems so. Thanks for the insight, I think i'd switch enduring for stbfl.
---
Or you could just play the game normally and not get all up in your feelings when you see a ttv.
---
Theres always a hook in range. Unless its disabled or sabotaged
---
*im ten you bald bastard*
---
This clip is pure chaos, I love it.
---
That wasn't a pallet, that was a falcon punch
---
What are u talking about? Tf they didn’t send any messages, I’m just furious lil toilet seat 23 finds the damn hatch every time
---
Imo SCP-106 would probably be the easiest to implement. Give him the ability to walk through walls and as a way of delaying the game drag people into the pocket dimension where they need to find a way out. The map could be a containment facility of sorts I guess. SCP-049 and SCP-096 would be amazing to have but idk how they’d work. Either way I’d love to see some SCP content
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Imagine wasting 4 purple add ons and 2 cypress moris and not even get to use the mori what good is equipping it gonna do me huh
---
Realistically, if you’re a trash killer and camp pip without camping and tunneling. Like.. you seem to clearly be. You have absolutely no right to be coming on my thread with a shit opinion. Stage left you can see it.
---
thanks mematic,
---
very cool
---
What’s a slug? I wasted 4 purple add ons and 2 cypresses moris and only got a 3k and not a 4K like normal waste of my fucking shit
---
But if you did the totems before NOED was up it wouldn’t be a problem
---
4 o'clock skillcheck too
---
Expand if you can on the first part. As a survivor main I’m genuinely interested
---
With the way matchmaking has been I just hope it’s fixed by the time it comes out
---
That’s the thing I was chasing the last one and I hit her and she got a tremendous boost biggest I’ve ever seen and found the hatch, now I’ve wasted 4 purple add ons and 2 cypress morisl, and for what to go up in rank? Fuck that u don’t get shit from it, I just want to kill them
---
I believe that every single person should play as they wish, regardless of their rank, you wen't through yellow and green ranks too, am I right?
---
I disagree. Hag can be stronger than a Billy if played effectively.
---
I think you meant to say, “Oh yes.”
---
Pretty sure you’re on NA servers, where the sun is down for everyone
---
my favorite is when i vault a window and run for a second and then get hit through the same window
---
I need that helmet to be Claudettes new skin
---
Does a crouching animation really get you that upset? Sounds like you’re just sensitive 🤷‍♂️
---
Teabag should cause exhaustion! Then they will learn! ^/s
---
The scream movies don't own that robe lmao
---
Lol I think the best I’ve seen was a Hag with 8 traps around the hooks but never stepped more than 10m away anyway.
---
He doesn't play in America.
---
:D
---
&gt;the whole reason is to piss the killer off
---
yes, thats the only reason and you are clearly demonstrating it works.
---
&gt; The point of the game is not to get blood points. The point is to pip and rank up.
---
Really? For me the point of the game is to have fun. And most fun rounds are those where I get closer to 30k BP before bonuses. So you're telling me I'm playing this game in a wrong way? You'd like me to start running ruin/noed/sloppy and aiming to pip every game?
---
I’ve got messages about tunneling and face camping and lag, but none those games, god fucking dammit I’m mad that I didn’t get to use my mori thats it end of story, I still went up in rank because it was a 3k, but the game shouldn’t let the final survivor off so easy
---
Clean your room :D
---
its not the animation its the meaning of the animation
---
I really like the hair. Nice work.
---
Pretty much. If you’re lucky you might just have enough time to pull off we’ll make it before she comes back, but most of the time you need Borrowed Time against that cunt and need to purposefully get the heartbeat.
---
Scp-049 wouldnt work really. Scp-096 could walk around and hit people with his razor sharp claws and his ability would be similiar to SCP-Secret Laboratory of when a person looks at it, It will scream in agony and stay there for a bit screaming. Then it would get Movement speed, vault speed and pallet break speed and It can hit survivors during this state. Add ons could extend the period it stays up and red add ons would increase momevent speed alot but delay the others, and maybe one add on could make it an instant down.
---
First of all if you've been playing for only 2 weeks then you really shouldn't complain, second of all reaching rank 10 is easy so it's not a huge achievement and third of all Google exists for hatch spawns... And who do you think you are that you can insult me when I'm trying to give you some fucking advice? Let me tell you one fucking thing boy.... if you rely too much on a Mori... You will lose.
---
I think the devs themselves said this game is "pay to lose". They design bright stuff, so when you buy it, you are actually more visible.
---
Absolute legend. Doesn’t even gloat or butt dance at the end. True gentleman. 👍👍
---
This genuinely disgusts me and makes my blood boil. People who get mad is one thing and I do it sometimes, it's natural, but  people who HUNT YOU DOWN to unload their rage should be banned from the game for harassment and bullying. Honestly, if BHVR doesn't implement some way to get these people banned, weed them out for the horrible people they are to make the community nicer, these people will kill the game they care about in their twisted, stupid way.
---
I messaged him and he replied "yoooo that's what's up"
---
Honestly, I'm probably still gonna go hard on killer when I play. But that's not gonna stop me from being a nice guy and giving last guy hatch or giving some advice
---
Oh okay, I thought it looked familiar lol. I never heard about that reveal though, that’s pretty funny.
---
Headphones are good with more killers than just Spirit.
---
No shock big cock doc doc
---
Agreed. Same for noed.
---
I don't think there's enough stats to make 10+ unique survivors.
---
Final result would be lobbies full of "meta" characters.
---
Who called me salty? I was talking about how the final survivor always finds hatch, and after reading ur comment I said this is why I face camp, because people like u who think it’s funny when a killer waste his mori, ur the toxic one here
---
C'mon, share a little bit!
---
Oh yeah the Mori that lets you kill the last one!!! That sucks. :(
---
It’s a Myers, couldn’t it just be Tier III?
---
its toxic
---
I also hear a gen exploding afterwards
---
and now i hear a megan sprinting away 
---
🤔
---
Clown is just getting drunk, he’s not actually helping
---
I’m rank 7, got paired with a rank 12 killer that said “I got my blood points.” Like that’s the goal of the game. 
---
Every player can play the game as they please, but if all your teammates decide to bail on you first hook, ignore gens, and run around the map the entire game because that’s how they have fun, would you want to play with them? I doubt it. So in this situation, the killer didn’t even try to do his job of killing all 4 of us and two of the survivors ignored their teammates. 
---
I just want to play with people that play the game how it was made to be played and I shouldn’t have to play survive with friends and gen rush (ruining the game for the killer) to do that.
---
Yea. The head case dlc and the charity one
---
yeah its pretty bad, i mean you die move onto the next trial, beat that killer lol... or not its only a game. :&gt;
---
Hag is really good and a lot of fun. Set your traps in buildings and jungle gyms. When you hook a survivor, drop one in front of the hook too. She can apply a lot of map pressure and seal areas off to injured survivors. Shes just slow starting off but she picks up momentum when she gets the first down. She just really suffers in the cornfields since you can't see over it.
---
Not using this cancer onwards will do the world more good
---
Dont do it any time lol
---
I don;t see anything on the first picture
---
,aight first off I have looked up spawns and they’re never there, 2nd I’m a rank 10 with 2 weeks experience beating rank 10 and below even red ranks getting 3k and 4K every game, and rely on a mori? Ha I just got these, I only saved up 2 because I was a level 20 Freddy and wanted to kill someone myself, but I still got a 3k and wasted a mori
---
 Bruh I posted this
---
that's not accidental lag right there
---
Ain’t like Xbox bans people fairly anyway, I get called a piece of shit, and the guy doesn’t get banned, but my friends get banned for replying “I don’t care” to a hate message
---
Claudette does have a stealthy outfit.
---
Sadly, 049 would be so cool! That would work, I think the only thing holding him back is just how they could implement and balance him, i guess it’d be Billy speed but with ghosts reveal mechanic with Myers terror radius with the terror radius replaced with crying. Either way to be great ^^
---
Yeah, like “i dont care that you won and want to taunt me at the exit gate or pallet, just leave already and stop trying to be a bully”
---
The general balance that devs look for is 2 alive, 2 dead. And I want my mf blood points soooo fugg off.
---
900-950k
---
He hit the bricks he didn’t hit Ash.
---
Just repeat that for any killer tbh lol
---
Aight, thanks!
---
ah, my one month of learning parabolas in high school finally pays off!
---
*Looks at flair*
---
Can't relate
---
Yup. Only to be called sweaty in the end :( 
---
Killermain btw
---
Why September tho
---
1. If the killer can get you both down at the same time within ds's timer, you either deserve it or you're against a god (who deserves it)
---
2. Just have it so it doesnt count for if you are downed. I am only talkong about if he downs and hooks another, you shouldnt be able to be downed 40 seconds later and still use ds
---
If it was lore friendly killer instinct would have to be on the person who saw them. The bag could add some play, maybe someone would have to sneak behind him or something. I like the idea of it stopping at rage, maybe have it so when entering a rage, if you see people they become marked targets too? So you can chain downs a little of survivors aren’t careful
---
If u don’t get 4K’s often, then ur bad, I feel bad just getting a 3k, also it’s a cypress mori, the one that lets u kill the last survivor, I’m not saying hatch’s need a fix, I’m just saying it’s bullshit how the survivor gets so lucky and finds it before me, and I wasted 2 cypress because they got to hatch first
---
Mine would just start bottom right :X
---
People who play since beta/release/2016:
---
I see no god up here
---
Other than me
---
Yes it is, they always say nice tunneling or face camp much? And shit like that, like what do u want me to do, let u get away????
---
Didn't you know? Its practically Halloween already, my place of work has had Halloween stock on sale since last week.
---
wow, neato, another matchmaking post.
---
Legion and Doctor. Since i play console it’s actually refreshing to go against a nurse.
---
That just makes this even better!
---
My point is mainly about killers who go out of their way to ignore other survivors to get to you, thats the toxic part
---
Downing the farmed survivor and going for the other one is a good compromise and its not something i complain about. Just downing the farmed one and killing them is the problem, ignoring the asshole on the team
---
why is it always Freddie with NOED
---
Sounds good. We need some perks though. Any Ideas that would fit him? Perk names could be:  Cruel Containment. Object Class Euclid. Secure, Contain, Protect.
---
Everyone disliked that
---
Just the killers helping reset for the next game while the survivors are popping in and out of the campfire.
---
Are you actually complaining that your dark cosmetics aren't dark enough?
---
Its a bug that happens very rarely. I’ve only seen it once in my 1000 hours. You either need to get hooked, find the hatch, or wait for endgame collapse to kill you for the game to end.
---
??? Michael and pig doesn't
---
Dude! That happened to me today. I did a fair bit of looping. Maybe 30 seconds worth (idk if that's a lot) before she gave up and ran off. Later downed me and spent the next minute just hexing the ever loving balls out of my hook and she never got more than... Idk 15m max from the hook.
---
I watched the original for the first time last week, who has time to watch ten movies in seven days? A lot of people catch onto a series later than others. Don't discriminate just because you do things your own way.
---
Awesome true team playing right here
---
Idk why people are downvoting me for this, I literally had a game the other day where the survivor would religiously loop pallets and teabag on the other side, then the moment you go to break it it's flashlight with add-ons to the face. Imagine being in a chase where they do this *six times,* because that's what happened to me.
---
If it ever happens again, you need to fall off the side of the map 2 times to get reset into the main map, you'd need to find the hatch from there to escape.
---
Hill billy
---
I had the same glitch happen against a Michael on the same map. Unfortunately I went in the middle stairway and fell down, resetting the burst getting me killed.
---
actually starting coughing and wheezing
---
I had this happen to me but I was playing killer. Brutal killer btw
---
bro, the post literally has a spoiler warning.
---
Trust me I know how you feel. I get called that also after I kill 2 or 3 of them toxic survivors.
---
I will not allow anyone to harm this gentleman
---
What I’m not going to do is listen to someone who posted a weird ass DBD porn image...
---
Fun fact about this website; you can add a spoiler warning AFTER someone has claimed it's a spoiler, isn't that something?
---
**noed:** now dig on this
---
Every killer that one shot the survivors.
---
cypress mori's are pointless really, why are you so upset about losing yellow mori offerings?
---
I feel your pain bro, I’m a killer main myself and all I do to keep myself sane is to remember that it’s just a video game...don’t care about pips/ranks, all I focus on is making the survivors as miserable as I can 😈
---
Adrenaline, BT, DS, insta heals, BNP, flashlights, keys and many more, meanwhile not so good killers have to rely on a perk that can be countered when it's not even active
---
Hahahahahahahahaha haaa
---
Here we see an illiterate meme, indicative of the DbD community's collective IQ.
---
Wow, these are well done!
---
Every killer from movies and series should have their own games
---
You didn’t see anything!
---
You're a genius bro
---
Either they buffed overcharge or death by stray pebble.
---
Before last gen, it will pop ya. After last gen, you're just wearing an uncomfortable hat
---
I would love to do this to a killer while in chase!
---
Yeah legit strategy my ass soooooooo
---
Hahaha I can’t imagine killers reaction. “Is it rude to kill them? Is it rude to not kill them? The line between them is really blurred”
---
Who was the killer anyway?
---
*facecamp intensifies*
---
Tru3 : Did he Dead Hard?
---
Exactly. You rush into the locker in front of him and he opens it and you're gone.
---
If only the original movie had come out in 1978 and not seven days ago.
---
LOL.
---
I'm just gonna limit myself to Demogorgon and middle-tier killers like Pig or Clown for a week or so, that's fair enough for newbies I think
---
This describes like, every online game ever.
---
We suffered until we got good they will too. *but give them a tiny break*
---
Feng i think?
---
Holy hell people do this?!
---
Halloween 2018 is the sequel of the original one, so watching the others first isn't necessary.
---
Pig got merged hard without compensation so she's the worst killer right now. As for perks I'd just run BBQ, enduring, spirit fury, and ruin. Basic build. Just hope they ruin lasts.
---
Remember that killer is time management. Every action you do needs to have a purpose or else you're wasting time. That's why the loadout I suggested is so strong, since it wastes very little time playing normally.
---
Also please watch scottjund's looping video. Search "damnnohtml looping" on YouTube.
---
Don't care about pipping. Seriously you don't know how dumb it is to play at rank 1 as killer and survivor. Too many tryhards on both sides.
---
Oh same, I was playing Trapper for the daily. If they were doing it to actually get away I wouldn't have cared, it was more the fact they taunted behind the pallet, blinded every time then ran away so they had clear scratchmarks to follow, it just didn't make sense outside of extending the chase and annoying me (he eventually wandered into a trap and he didnt survive the basement)
---
LOL. Seriously talented work, man.
---
Honestly I’ve started running empathy to avoid injured survivors when playing with randoms, cause 9/10, they’ll run directly to me.
---
A good trapper is a nightmar to go against, especially if they know some really good spots here traps are barely visible. Just look up Otzdarva on twitch or Not Otzdarva on YouTube and you will see how nutty Trapper can be in the right hands.
---
Am I just supposed to watch every single movie that has ever came out in all of history to avoid spoilers of them in-case someone decides to not tag spoiler alert on Reddit? Your logic is incredible.
---
Demon suit is actually the only possible outfit he can use as it doesn't have those stupid floating things. I pair it with prestige mask and it's okay, even though I'm already sick of using only one skin
---
I have come the man!
---
“I will pick up meg directly in front of this dwight who is actively trying to flashlight me and nothing will to wrong”
---
If the last gen has popped before you got it, just waltz away to the exit.
---
If not, find the hatch or take it off.
---
Well guess what buddy that’s what we called RNG! You either find it first or the survivor period! You know survivors bring ultra rare items too you know, and things don’t goes as plan but we ain’t here crying about it. Seriously you need help if a video game gets you this mad for losing items.
---
We lost 69 and 420 posts boys.
---
Pack up. The Stranger Things kids won't ever be able to experience the joy of sharing their 69th hour. *We'll never be able to watch them grow up damn it...*
---
Feng Min, we are used to call her Lin Lin and sometimes I forget that is not her name lol
---
Or just don’t care, it’s just a game ? Lmao
---
How? If you think hooking a survivor and watching him because it's obviously likely the other survivors are able to run out at any moment is not appropriate, I pity you.
---
It isn't that rare anymore it seems...
---
Those are the eyes of a man on a week long meth bender
---
ya but can myers teabag
---
Hag is easily top 5 killer after Nurse/Spirit/Billy. It's honestly a toss up at 4th for Hag or Huntress.
---
Ah so most survivor mains.
---
Streamers are more often toxic if they die, however, at least my impression is that there are more toxic streamers than not. It's one thing for some random guy in your lobby to bitch, it's another for some random streamer to start bitching to all their followers and start harassing you and trying to flood you with Steam friend invites or threaten to come over IRL and do horrible things to you and your dog.
---
Also because they're trying to cater to their viewers they tend to do things that are aggravating to play against, like sabotage squads (even though this takes long enough that it's usually in your favor if they go all-out on it).
---
I'm sure it's aggravating to play against an Ebony Mori with Dying Light and Thanatophobia against a Freddy with an action speed slowing addon and Franklin's Demise who hooks you next to generators in order to use his teleport to tunnel the ever-loving crap out of you.
---
Almost as frustrating as four Adrenalines, four Decisive Strikes, four Engineer toolboxes with BNPs, four Unbreakables, four Balanced Landings, and stacked fog and Haddonfield offerings when even *with* Ruin you don't really stand a chance.
---
Somehow it conects better to his arm than his watch on the left arm
---
It's most likely a party though
---
BNPS and flashlights are not even that strong. Keys and insta heals are really strong but so are items like prayer beads and iridescent head so they are equivalents to those, not noed. Bt and ds are strong perks but not in noeds caliber. The only thing here that is on noeds caliber is adrenaline and at least you have to work to get it.
---
They're trying to get easy killers so fuck them
---
I'm not sure why people tunnel/camp with Moris.
---
Ideally if you bring an Ebony Mori you really want to hook every person once before mori'ing your first victim so that they don't go super-immersed right away (although given generator speeds w/ Ruin they might just gen-jockey you out of the game if you don't Mori one).
---
I know once people start dying and I lose hope of doing the generators I search chests for keys, break totems, etc, or hop on with the other survivor and pop enough to spawn hatch between immersing if for some reason we haven't completed three yet.
---
Why didn't you touch any gens though?
---
If you are acting like this after only two weeks, I think you should uninstall and just find another game. You obviously can't handle the stress of this game and can only imagine how you'll act when the survivors start getting good.
---
Unexperienced killer, doesn't look at least at opposite direction when picking up somebody. Now he has experience.
---
Well the survivors in that movie were pretty toxic
---
People can't just type gg and go next. They need to showoff
---
That's why I use the brown hair with that sweater!
---
Dang he was so thirsty for the kill, nice stuff dude
---
No the Bonus BP are just for getting the 8k maximum faster. You are not actually getting extra bp
---
like after every rank reset, some of the veterans from both sides don't want new players
---
Well, he's a 4.6 which is the top speed for a killer. But, his power can be negated by simply keeping track of his location and his very easily looped once his power has been deactivated. It has a 30 second cooldown and is very counterable. Just takes time getting used to him.
---
Did you do it? What did it cost?
---
Y tho?
---
Dont ask me xD, ask the devs
---
Rank 3 is not enough I guess but thank you for advice.
---
no, if you're new you should spend as little as possible on your bloodwebs to get more perks for less BP and get to teachables quicker
---
Word?
---
Sprint Burst tier 30
---
Everything about the game is very easy once you've put enough time into it. That's why I like the random teleport characters like Nurse and Demigorgon because it adds some type of variety to the game. Survivor is just skill check simulator with random loop adventures.
---
Can we include "I hit rank X" posts in spam? Rank 1 MAYBE is significant, but "I reached rank 4 for the first time, and I'm still going to rank 1" is just absolutely useless.
---
Ah. Maybe I will try her then? I watch Tru3 already, but I don't really watch many of his Spirit videos, so I'll have a look. Thank you :)
---
Go spirit, she's a blast and super strong
---
Bro you just beat some records 😂👌
---
O
---
is that bamboozle or blood warden?
---
Thank you very much for advice. :)
---
That is a tough choice but I’d genuinely go with the Spirit first. That’s who I’m saving up to get next as well. 
---
Although I don’t see many people using the Plague, her perks are great and she seems interesting. It’d be fun to puke on a bunch of survivors lol.
---
Spirit 100% Plague becomes really boring after a few games.
---
And who has a better story than Dwight the broken?
---
im well aware :p. BUT CAN BILLY DO A 720 WITH HIS POWER THO?
---
Some of them are crazy overpowered like not being able to hear approaching or 1 hit abilities. Other than that I’d say it’s pretty fair
---
Auric Cells probably right...
---
It's almost as if you kinda need it eh
---
Yeah I think so.
---
What's wrong with not gen tapping? I actually think people who do this, are annoying.

How tall is he?
---
Wait are you saying it is a bad thing? Nobody should tap gens.
---
Its bamboozle for so I can close them pesky double window loops and get them running somewhere else :)
---
there is the official dead by daylight discord, no subreddit one though.
---
Yeah probably no killers, like they did with Ash Williams.
---
Did not know this existed. I'll have to look into it, would be nice if it were in game though
---
Thank you
---
It’s a circlejerk that gets karma 
---
People who dislike other players simply because they are trying to advertise their small stream are douchebags and it’s fairly easy to understand why
---
i also thought that for way to long
---
I mean you only didn't see it in low ranks, so see it as practise to get better because in high ranks you'll maybe have 1/10 matches without it, because the killer needs it against good survivors
---
I think it's this Wednesday
---
He had deliverance, I'd take my chances with a facecamper if I had a 100% chance of Kobe'ing
---
Oh definitely, I just don’t have the patience to get past her learning curve. I mostly play Freddy when I play killer. But I’ve seen some top tier console Nurses and I admire them.
---
It’s Wednesday my dudes
---
- Haunted Grounds lasts for 60 seconds and then leaves the killer with 1 less perk for the rest of the game. It’s easy to play stealthy in this time too.
---
- Make Your Choice lasts for 60 seconds, only applies to one survivor, and again is easy to stealth around.
---
- Devour Hope....lol 95% of games that totem us gonna be gone before it ever gets to level 3
---
- Rancor - I’ve still never gone down to this. So easy to stealth play it.
---
- Myers - Needs to stalk and delay a chase to get an instadown. When he does it only lasts for 60 seconds and is easy to stealth around or loop him.
---
Leatherface - Has to get really close to pull it off. Suffers a huge penalty if he misses and hits a wall. Cant pull it off usually unless the survivor messes up or hes created a Deadzone.
---
All those instadowns are fine. They’re strong but balanced by the fact they have a very limited duration or can be played around massively by stealth, or delayed by looping.
---
That just leaves...
---
NOED - Its NOED
---
Hillbilly - Can just swing, swing, swing all game if he likes. Doesn’t suffer anywhere near as much a penalty as LF does if he hits a wall. Doesn’t even have to get close either. Doesnt suffer a slowdown, so he can just casually walk behind a survivor charging it then zooms forward and theres little chance for a survivor to outplay it due to the gigantic hitbox.
---
Ghostface - Reveal mechanic is completely broken and does not work as intended. Literally no point trying to reveal him, you might as well just run.
---
The top exposed and instadowns are fine imo, easy to play around but add suspense for the survivors. The bottom 3 however feel cheap as fuck.
---
Yeah hopefully they add something like it but for now this is, dare I say.. a pretty good job so far? xD
---
No doubt Im glad it's a thing. I like numbers and I'd like to see my progress with stats other than an arbitrary rank
---
Cosmetics are always Wednesday mornings
---
Its pretty much always the people that get the free escape that tbag too lmao
---
Guessing they dont get to escape based on skill so they got to brag whenever they get carried by their perks and have the chance
---
haha!
---
So, if I got that right, it's coming on Wednesday, right?
---
I have no idea
---
Wp
---
Hillbilly would like to know your location
---
They really cant not when the team is farming each other to death, one is dead and 2 are in hook. Lol silly noob
---
I think it's the day after Tuesday but the day before Thursday
---
No no it’s two days after Monday
---
I love when they stand on the hills to do this, it just looks so funny.
---
You sure? I thought it was hump day
---
Oh yeah I love playing legion, but sometime I definitely feel like he’s a bit too weak and it hinders the fun. I’m not too sure if I’m just misplaying tho or if he’s actually that bad. Was curious what y’all had to say
---
You're calling me a noob while you tell me you can't do gens while the killer is busy with your teammates.
---
Yeah, the only free perk is SWF but it's the best perk
---
That's not lag. The Entity gave you hope, and then took it away from you, leaving you annoyed and confused. It's all part of the game!
---
100% C A L C U L A T E D
---
Yeah, I’m gonna go ahead and call bullshit. Are *some* streamers toxic and/or whiny? Definitely. Are **all** streamers that way? Most definitely not. I legit got mori spammed for 4 gens by a clown and was *laughing* about it, not crying and asking my chat to harass someone for it. And what streamer worth their two cents would *actually* do that?
---
But I genuinely don’t get the whole “mori the streamer” thing. Make up whatever excuse you want to make yourself look like a jerk, I guess. But I’d honestly rather see someone say “I’m just not a nice person” over “you used x y z perks” or “lulstreamer” or whatever nonsense.
---
I genuinely hope someone gives you a hug, though, cause damn do you need one apparently.
---
Big cock no shock Doc?
---
I think like someone said earlier loses its edge in lower ranks. I've beat a red ranks using (wait for it and God forbid) Noed. Add ons that cause mangle help as well. For me I usually play my main who's ghost face get a 4k then switch to legion I got my win a already now I just wanna jump over pallets
---
No it'll run for a week or so.
---

“Asymmetrical horror game” one side is supposed to be OP
---
How is your game so bright
---
Bad. Really really bad. Deep wounds are literally useless, so don't bother chaining survivors if your goal is to deep wound them. You power is an injure and mobility tool, nothing more.
---
Meanwhile I'm playing ghost face and a survivor can pinpoint my ass from across the map and decloak me
---
NOED can be cleansed/prevented. Adrenaline cannot. Noed happens through survivors not cleansing totems. Its a risk survivors take. Plus noed can still be cleansed even after activation.
---
It has nothing to do with failing to defend gens. Adrenaline and noed are equal in terms of power.
---
If the rumor is correct the bp event will be this weekend. That would be over a week before the dlc would go live.
---
Yeah obviously the legion can be good if your opponents aren’t lol. Sorry not trying to sound like a dick, I’m mostly wondering how exactly he stacks up given the survivors are competent
---
Called me?
---
Endgame DS. They can still crawl to the gates within 60 seconds. Im saying how do you counter that retard? Oh wait you can’t, you’re just trying to play dumb because you’re a shit player who needs his free escape. Not surprised from someone with the name “hailsatan” though.
---
Also what if the person unhooking has DS active? Cant grab them. Cant slug if theyl gates are open either.
---
There are literally multiple videos of these instances out there so they’re not uncommon.
---
You’re being disingenuous just to be an ass. I dont even have that much of a problem with current DS but its obvious theres zero counterplay to endgame DS, and its hilarious seeing all the salty survivor mains here going rabid whenever someone mentions their sacred free escape perk
---
Idk if deep wounds are useless right? It’s pretty solid if you deep wound someone, then jump to another person to deep wound and chase them right? Or is it really that bad? Thanks
---
&gt; Now we just have to hope these rules are enforced.
---
We're aware that the rule enforcement is lackluster lately; it's no secret that we're pretty understaffed right now, combine this with different IRL schedules and the overall subreddit activity and the problem is huge. But this is the reason why new mods are our top priority and why we haven't limited the mod apps to 2-3 "new mod slots" so to speak.
---
Slug them and they crawl out. Pick them out, they ds and run out. Neither works.
---
Get outta here with your lower case d
---
its also possible if you struggle out of a trap right as the trapper was picking you up. happened to me once. when he hooked a survivor i got into the hooking animation too lmao
---
Can tell this guy is a toxic green rank survivor main by how much of a douche he acts
---
#Darn
---
For the killer as well ;)
---
He's a good spirit. Make sure u can follow scratch mark, hear pain survivor with headphone. Sometime stay still when they drop plallet and see where they go or they just stand there
---
Just throwing this one out there, could we include emblem posts in this or a future rule update?
---
Specifically I mean those posts where the progress bar is sitting at the iridescent mark but doesn't actually give iridescent emblem. We get it, emblems aren't consistent and it's annoying. But we don't need an update post every single time it happens.
---
But he is super easy to play, as Spirit you have to at least know how to track ;)
---
I looked at this for 5 minutes trying to figure it out and didn't notice that it had movement, then I chuckled
---
This is a very old build, I haven't played her since my third prestige. If there is not either bbq or ruin  I avoid playing them...unless it's my pLaG who I love dearly :)
---
Angela Anaconda!
---
We have internally discussed this a few times, though the last time was months ago. Back then, we agreed that it's some sort of accomplishment for each individual player and the comments were usually very helpful and wholesome.
---
We can revisit this topic if it's a possible issue again. Would y'all be open to a poll and/or a "focused feedback" Megathread about this to discuss this?
---
*Regurgitates slowly*
---
Idk man, Rainbow six siege takes the cake for saltiness.
---
jesus ppl can be toxic on this site. just calm down and be ready for anything. its the internet bro!
---
Yep, he can fly across the map forever.  Don't worry, it's balanced by the 0.5 second cooldown.
---
How do you feel about sneaking in the hook death animation cam with a super close up head nod?
---
When you can chain several hits its pretty cool but sensible survivors stay far away from each other when they know it's a legion.
---
How to track? Just listen and follow scratch marks, there is nothing more to it.
---
Also, her window vault animation and phantom husk are superb mind plays.
---
Add BBQC, Butter Murmer and Infectious Fright and you literally can not escape her.
---
the shape main here, dont complain about not having cosmetics k? ive mained him for nearly 2 years now and im still waiting
---
Finished the game a while ago......

Ahhh, here we see a Bubba in his natural habitat. They are not very smart creatures but they are  protective of their prey. In this shot we see the Bubba trying to blendette himself while waiting for his next victim to arrive.
---
Well i suppose it's kinda better that way. Newbs don't have to fight against people just farming ;)
---
Weren't splinters turned into ebony moris
---
I mean you said you facecamp so it doesn’t even matter that you get a 4k or not. Learn how to play the game properly
---
Hard one. Nurse's calling if you use a one shot killer. Enduring if you have long chases involving pallet loops.
---
while we are stuck in that stupid camera spin the killers are free to move. 
---
It is fucking stupid.
---
Enduring. No decent survivor heals within the terror radius, NC is rarely useful any more.
---
Not all killers have terror radius. Depends on their play style.
---
Sorry for no sound, not sure why it did that 🙃
---
And still comparing which is useful on a wider range of killers, there's less killers that have no terror radius than enjoy enduring.
---
Trapper especially needs ruin. Without that early game pressure 4 gens will pop in an instant. And if he does try to get some pressure he'll have no setup.
---
In truth I really don't understand why gens are so fast that a perk that doesn't work 98% of the time is still almost completely mandatory just to make it a little less insane
---
Must be stream sniping
---
This literally happened to me yesterday. It didn't affect anything, though.
---
for real though as a beginner i genuinely have no idea how to even try to loop him-
---
Can we also get default perk flairs?
---
I'll look into both of those. Thank you!
---
Yeah it didnt change anything. It's still funny though.
---
Thank you!
---
LITHE? The worst exhaustion perk? THAT is total BS. You're saying that Sprint Burst is better than Lithe. Think about it. You can't even RUN correctly with Sprint Burst. I ONLY agree about the BL part.
---
What/Where is the video from
---
I honestly find the first one being better. It fits to dbd better and the other one is "too cute" I guess.
---
I just have to figure out how to use her because I tried and I suck so bad lol. Thank you!
---
Nicole Tv, she’s a YouTuber.
---
I'm on console. What makes a difference between the platforms?
---
*I tell you, I will not forget our adage*
---
Thanks
---
Indeed ...survivors are losing their motivation to play vs the Doc or Wraith...from what I've seen on the survivor side you're going to see more and more of this against those two killers.  I play out my matches but it's becoming more soul sucking to do so against those two killers as we are usually short a player within the first minute.  Usually hoping for a farming situation just to make it tolerable.  I've mentally turned those matches into little practice sessions that don't count that I have suffer through til I get a real match.  "Find my happy place"...until the next match....sad ...but it's what I'm seeing.
---
I hate the corn fieldo lol. I never thought to play around with her much but I'll give it a go. Thank you!
---

It's a lot better to go to Lery's where sharp corners and the confusing layout makes it easier for Myers to ambush people and land that first hit, which is important as he is very slow with a short lunge, so having a map which is a lot more open isn't exactly a counter, but it just makes stuff a lot harder for you
---
It's always fun seeing all the Halloween hype, coming from a country where people rarely celebrate it (other than use it as an excuse to get drunk).
---
When in middle of nowhere sprint burst is really good. If you are good, you use windows to loop the killer, not to get distance from him but whatever
---
It’s a matter of putting laundry away :p
---
Tryin' to make use of Insidious, I'm guessing.
---
Ironically it's not the killer's
---
Pallet stuns/Flashlight blinds don't make the killer drop the survivor when done in the pickup animation, you have to time them to hit afterwards. This would allow pallet stuns to do it while the killer is still picking them up. (Arguably of little use since you can just wait for the animation to finish. )
---
Thank you :)
---
Thankss
---
Wow,another 23689743 years old skyrim meme, how original.
---
Wherever I have someone on hook and another downed I just wait for the hook to die so that way I don't have to sit through their whole struggle phase
---
Because neon Nea players are generally thought of as toxic fucks, ot Noob3 wannabes. Not saying you are either of those things, but that's why I generally leave them alone. I love it when I break a chase with them and they run up behind me clicking a flashlight while I down their friends.
---
Na just stop the endgame clock
---
exactly the same here, and so often, they are sprinting in the exact moment I start to leave which is fine against some killers... but for the love of god, do not do that against the hag, and then scream camping. happened like 4 times in a row last night, and I just had to vent a bit.
---
Thanks I though of it as I was writing my question and I thought it would be a good idea
---
The generator killer her. arrest it now
---
You're right. They don't. But they can still claim "mah copyrights" regardless. Have you met America?
---
Jesus Christ you just stated your findings why so many downvotes
---
Based and redpilled
---
It’s becoming a more common bug, unfortunately. If you’re in a game and you can’t do the hand gestures or you don’t see a progress bar when healing, then the bug is there apparently. I just let myself get sacrificed if that happens. It sucks, but there’s not much you can do until they decide to fix it. Hopefully it’s just a one-time thing for you!!
---
Being almost guaranteed to lose the killer once per game sounds pretty decent, awkward but funny if you exit the locker next to them though.
---
It's fairly common right now, if they don't drop pallets early you get a free hit when it breaks.
---
Be honest,  was he in there first
---
Don't be so toxic next time! I see the amount of gens you rushed! I see ds! Adrenaline! Bloody clothes! Not dying on 1st hook...well...SHAME!
---
The dbd quentin looks a lot more tired, like how Benedict describes him in his journal, the edit seems like he’d be really optimistic
---
Skins aren't supposed to give an advantage, but they shouldn't give a disadvantage either. Or are survivors the only ones allowed to complain about neon bright cosmetics? Salt aside, my only complaint really lies with Ghostface. His newest outfit is very well designed but due to the chrome mask and chrome entity tassels I won't be using it. Meanwhile my Nurse has more all black outfits than he does.
---
Laugh in myers
---
Why the spirit has collision in her phase walk I will never know. Why the spirit has no animation when she's using her phase walk I will never know. Why the spirit has no animation when she's climbing through a window I will never know.
---
Standing still should not be the most powerful mindgame in the game.
---
It would be funny to reverse the rolls can you imagine
---
Best comment here.
---
Hahaha lol, it’s wasn’t a gen rush.
---
No he wasn’t.
---
*Blendette would like to know your location.*
---
also, thats you r
---
total amount of BP, not how much you earned
---
he said git gud
---
I played myself lol
---
Thanks :D
---
np :D
---
They really do need to be fixed though. I've had my hex totems spawn right next to the survivor spawn countless times and other times I've seen it dead in the middle of an open field just sitting there. Then there's places like Badham and Lampkin where they spawn in the middle of a completely opaque bush where survivors could never find them.
---
&gt; All other BP bonuses seem to be applied post-trial.
---
It's only wglf, BBQ and offerings which are applied after the game.
---
All other perks (thrill of the hunt, beast of prey, distressing, no one left behind, prove thyself) increase the rate you gain towards the cap
---
We'll add them once we implement a Reddit Flair Bot like r/destinythegame, r/pokemon and the like. Currently we're still using reddit's native user flair system with a limit of 300 user flairs, which we already reached by now.
---
Both of mine will do this as well, they really love all the particles in the first title screen thing it's so adorable.
---
just happened yesterday to me.
---
I was hooked and wanted to Kill myself so the other guy can get the hatch.
---
I unhooked myself first try, got downed again, used my DS and unlocked the hatch with a key.
---
truly Epic Moment
---
Vaulting a window randomly injures the survivor
---
Just think the map would be 3008 with a 3008-1 as the killer
---
Frames. PC has 60 fps to where console only has 40 iirc
---
I only ever get them at like 50%, I have the worst luck
---
Difference between normal 3 gen and 3 gen hostage is that you are willing to actually hit and down and hook survivors, you are trying to advance the state of the match -&gt; to kill survivors.
---
We hallowed season now boi
---
I’m stupid, explain.
---
Pwyf increases all movement, including carrying survivors and power activation,  in saying that I'd say spirits power mostly renders it only slightly helpful as opposed to its impact on someone like leatherface wraith or trapper
---
Lemon_Birb, cheers for the idea. I appreciate your creativity. Without you, I wouldnt have thought of this.
---
was that first screenshot taken on a PS1? jfc them jaggies
---
Doctor's new name is Theo
---
This was indeed on PS4. I never stopped running the whole match. The Michael tried but couldn’t keep up. Eventually I found the hatch and escaped
---
Billy is fine as it is.My only problem with him is the instadown addons tbh,other than that he's completely loopable
---
I would even be able to say there was a buff to DS. By nerfing the Enduring, which many M1 killers run, they buffed the DS. Right, now you have only up to 2 oppurtinities to use it, only 60 seconds, etc. but survivors who are not an obsession don't have to wiggle to 35% to use it, you cannot dribble survivor with DS to the hook. And because of the nerf of the Enduring, stun is even longer.  I woul be fine with the fact that this perk is stronger when used to punish tunneling actions, but man, it's goddamn 60 seconds! You can do so many things in this time, you're not a tunneler, but you still get punished by perk that should punish tunneling. That's riiculous. Maybe remove the timer part completely and make this perk active after being unhooked until killer hooks someone else. That would be a fair tool to counter tunneling.
---
Hag is survivor dependant because toxic neas and immersed Claudettes can ruin you
---
And her Test Subject one has made me glance at her, think she's a surv, turn and then get ambushed. Both make her harder to see haha
---
I like the 6 hooks idea, it stops the tunnelling with moris that often happens, maybe make it 4 hooks though as 6 is a bit steep. 
---
But why add that for NOED? NOED is meant to be a backup to having a bad game or being gen rushed, that would defeat the point of it.
---
Is it fair to say noob3 is probably the best survivor?
---
This is like the time they added black beard from r6
---
I like to watch their streams after my match with them, get clips from them, and have fun and chat with them for a bit.
---
I never understood all these people wanting to run mori, trying to ruin everyone's fun, especially the streamer for just trying to have their own slice of fun and entertain an audience.
---
It's so much more fun to keep in mind that it's just another person like you and instead of trying to make things awful for them, you try to make them and their audience have extra fun. Even if they only have 2 or 3 viewers.
---
If you want to do a fun and easy build with her, you can run her 3 hex perks, and either BBQ, NOED, Nurse's Calling, or Monitor and Abuse, or Haunted Ground. Just dont trap the hook when using Devour Hope. You want your stacks to get up to at least 3. Then you can Insta down everyone. At 5 you can straight up just Mori survivors.
---
“WHACK” 
---
Now get on that hook while I lag away
---
Pls start adding more guidelines to memes I'm tired of seeing memes made in 30 seconds with img flip watermarks and the impact font. Or even just posts that say something along the line of "when you __________" then random reaction image with no relation to dead by daylight.
---
These flood the sub and make it really hard to browse on mobile because people upvote them to the front page somehow
---
I got really excited, I also managed to find the hatch ;)
---
PS4 player btw
---
I consider him the worst. I know new killers swarm to him and love him because he’s extremely easy to play. But his power is just weak.
---
At the end of the day, it’s all depends on your skill though. You can certainly play Legion at red ranks and win, it’s all about your personal knowledge of maps, survivor play, map pressure, loops etc
---
Credit u/chattywindow I'm getting tired of replying to every single one of these posts taking his art
---
Yeah I can see how it would be steep to have 6. I added NOED because it seems that almost everyone hates that it is a crutch perk so I was trying to add something that would make it a little bit harder to activate so you have to actually do something in the game so you can decimate everyone in the endgame.
---
Depends what you mean by “best”, he literally reinvented the game to the point killers have to play stealth and survivors are aggressive - as opposed to it being the other way about, so he’s one of the best in terms of aggro survivor, but he doesn’t play stealth survivor at all so he isn’t the best in that sense.
---
Either way he’s changed the game for survivors
---
But...thats a 180?
---
most good survivors will heal inside your TR when they know your chasing another survivor and if you TR is one of the smaller ones, nurses calling will reveal them before they hear your heartbeat
---
One of my all time favourite songs honestly, a classic.
---
You can play the game without tunnelling people who dont know how to run you around for example. Thats what Im gonna do, if I ever play killer. Basically not eliminating them immediately before they even get a grasp of whats going on.
---
I think as your player level rises you are awaited with more shards.
---
I like this a lot. I would Just change the last perk to reduced time or When you start a chase with a healthy survivor.
---
Well it is to one with the most “forgiving” activation conditions, what with it not limiting your options to 1 survivor or praying to catch the last one.
---
oh. and tunneling.
---
I'd get plauge and then level her up so when you get spirit you can Use infectious fright on her.
---
Laughs a little,
---
Coughs for 2 hours.
---
The guy who invented most of modern survivor gameplay was 72hrs and his group. They invented the 360, moonwalking and popularized looping.
---
Repost :/
---
Imagine playing this fucking 20fps game on console and on a TV. BY the time your first M1 press registers the survivors are done opening the exit gate.
---
Try spine Chill. It will tell you when he's stalking you
---
He cowers in fear of the raw power.
---
You're color-blind.
---
What were they doing that was toxic
---
I guess play along isn't the best wording. I mean that one shouldn't let tilt take over their playstyle. Most people who get outplayed will get angry and make even more mistakes, so a good tip is to try to have fun. Whether it be shaking your head up and down, spinning with high dpi, etc...
---
Dwelling on mistakes will tilt even the best players.
---
so satisfying
---
Dope
---
So credit to a random guy form dragon con
---
NOED is survivor punishment for genrushing
---
And I'll stop complaining when the Thompson house stops existing.
---
My new favorite post on this subreddit. Such a cutie!
---
Bming other words for tbaging / emotes
---
I'd switch Lithe for Dh or Bl but that's just me. Also maybe Bond instead of Borrowed so you don't run the killer towards survivors doing gens
---
Those fuckers deserved it
---
Could it be? Another Jake? I thought I was the only one!

Rank 16 survivor solo queue gets put in lobby 2 rank 8s and a rank 4 Vs rank 2 killer that spawned literally right next to me died in first hook survivors told me to learn how to play and to uninstall

Killers ping was so high yesterday he slapped me down and then couldnt find me. I was legit like 10 feet away from where he hit me.
---
I had the same thing happen to me when i used Lithe one time, it didn't stop until I crouched again
---
How recent is recently if you're rank 7, when you start from scratch it usually takes a while until you're at purple ranks already
---
He probably didn't have many good options
---
He isn't a great killer, but he's a fun killer. I've been at red ranks with bing boi, and some games  made me want to put a hole in my wall, most of the time I was having a blast, even if I ended up getting 0-1 kills, it was fun for me to "Surprise motherfucker" a legacy Jake sabo'ing a hook.
---
Play whatever killer you have fun with. Have a good one, lad :)
---
Haha thanks
---
I'm not really sure.
---
Main reason I started killer was because those perks were in the shop. But since I’m not kb&amp;m player and I’m on controller billy is really hard to play since it isn’t that easy to controller
---
That works too
---
I like Final Destination too but don't believe it would work very well in the game tbh
---
NOED is a reward for not being able to do the objective*
---
you really think literally any killer just lets survivors finish gens so they can start using NOED? I run NOED because until this last shrine I didn’t have access to teachable Ruin so I would get genrushed all the time
---
Take care legend:)
---
Just add the phrase "outside the killer's Terror radius" to A Simple Trick and it would be golden. That way, you wouldn't pop out right next to them, like on that tile with the 6 lockers all together.
---
This. As a killer main, salute to players who actually play the game and create beautiful plays like these.
---
I found Billy quite easy to use and I'm on ps4, every killer needs a bit of practicing but I feel like Billy is one of the easiest killers to play. But that's just my personal opinion
---
Look at the killer's bio. It should show their perks and if  they are teachable
---
If you go to the killer summary page (where you can read their backstory) you’ll see their teachables. If there is a padlock on the corner it’s locked. Otherwise you unlocked it.
---
It was for the meme man 😂
---
If you have nurse level 40 or you can check the characters description and it’ll have a tick next to nurses calling if you unlocked it through shrine.
---
If nurse is at level 40 and you collected the teachable node, the other killers will have a chance of getting NC in their bloodwebs.
---
Sprint burst lvl 4
---
Drawing's kinda choppy, or maybe that's just the subject matter
---
And then the little bitch disconnects.
---
*And God brought down thy F from the heaven to bless thy child with good match.*
---
You rage quit with BPS?
---
Same with Claudette. I mean, even the item description for her dress says hat it sticks out.
---
Thank you very kind of you to put that much time into teaching someone with the iq of a potato
---
I guess I haven’t gave him much of a try I just went to kyf with him and said o hell no I can’t do this but then again I was trying to do the thing that I saw noob3 do where he just cranked that bitch up infront of the survivor
---
I have definitely seen new pig cosmetics and just thought it was a metal head jeff urban evasioning around the place. Makes her way scarier.
---
So you’re breaking the rules of the game by dcing and also the rules of this sub by posting this... gg.
---
Oh ok. Hard to tell. People make some weird ass concepts but this one seemed serious so wasn't sure lol!
---
Well it would need to be tested in game within a test build before using it in the game itself. I would see it as a bit overpowered though.
---
Like another poster stated, that's your total after the BPs from your current match are added to the BPs you had going into that match.
---
sorry I don't check this sub religiously. just sharing an experience from "dead by daylight' on the "dead by daylight" Reddit where else am I supposed to post this shit, fuckin r/thatHappened ?
---
Thanks!
---
Still eternally long cause one of the problems isn’t your server location but it’s population
---
Ah ok. I did put it under memes/shitposts tho 😂
---
Oh didn't read the tag my bad lol!
---
Nobody reads tags so it's fine lol
---
Yeah. gg
---
Last week people weren't even letting the "he's got spirit" shit get off the front page before reposting it.
---
We need you to defend all the baby survivors who are coming with the next chapter
---
Accent colors are still colors that are easier to see. And I'd hardly call a bright red mask or hood "accent colors."
---
Epic Gamer Moment
---
my favorite so far, I was in a chase, suddenly a trap went off, I decided to break off and say hello, it was a trap next to a gen, they were swf so the dude just kept chugging on the gen, assuming i wouldnt come, so I pulled him off the gen and they all dced and went ballistic on me in chat.
---
r/dbdgonewild is a hell of a drug
---
There is no blood hunt happening. the DBD wiki posted it without any proof at all and the devs have said there is no blood hunt happening.
---
Same. I love doing that and hearing the commentary, especially when they're like "oh, nice job there!"
---
Amazing! The only thing I would change is her hair. I think it should be longer.
---
f. sorry my dude, i hope the next game treats you better &lt;3
---
From what you are saying, you enjoy playing Ghost Face more. I’d say put bloodpoints into him.
---
There is one coming actually, just not at the leaked time. The PTB got delayed, which in turn, delayed other planned events. Its not 100% yet, but its rather safe to assume that the bloodhunt will still be after the PTB.
---
Also the DBD wiki DID have proof, it was a datamined bloodhunt banner.
---
Thank you kind Sir
---
Will it ever be possible to semi enforce the “Small Billy” rule? Like I’m happy to see memes but even some semblance of effort into memes would be nice rather than going into memes tic and just “when you X but Y” with a picture unrelated and no real effort in it.
---
Thank You
---
Oh shit nvm Abt the blood hunt but I did save with relative ease so the question still stands.
---
&gt;the devs have said there is no blood hunt happening.
---
Where did they say this? Got a link for it? Genuinely asking.
---
I don't trust wiki and wasn't expecting a bloodhut but what you are doing isn't much different if you don't provide a source.
---
I definitely read that as drag con and was super confused for a second.
---
Bought ghostface yesterday after not playing the game for a while. Decided to buy my first skin with him. Someone tell me why I bought a red skin for the stealth killer? Please?
---
I do know that the developers did lighten almost all of the dark outfits.  I'm guessing killers complained? 
---
Some cosmetics are viable alternatives to survivors' defaults though.  Adam Francis' brown trench coat blends in much better than his default one for example.
---
Some cosmetics aren't.  Ironically I've had more trouble with finding some of the more garish looking survivors than the normal ones.  I guess if you play with those long enough you just learn to be very good at not being seen.
---
If this happened to me I'd have my fun and kms. It's too good.
---
Yes, I too use Insta-Saw Billy and Ebony Mori to do the Mori Daily.
---
What a load of bullshit lmao, I bet you're one of those Killers who only equips a Tier 1 Iron Grasp and basement camps as Bubba because "chill I had a daily to finish lol"
---
What about the pig? Everyone in the saw series brutally murdered everyone they captured.
---
There is no skill in standing still
---
If you're looking to get good perks, definitely nurse. But if you're looking to play the character you leveled up, go Ghost face because you enjoy him.
---
Adrenaline can be prevented by never reaching the end game. Not to mention there are various ways to break or insta down the survivor anyway.

---
I will agree to your claim only for certain maps, like Thompson house, and a few more. I generally don’t have a problem though.
---
Yeah and no ribbons to go thru walls and reveal where you are
---
Stop using the internet’s accessibility and freedom of speech as an excuse. You’re just an asshole.
---
I never shit on anyone for what perks they used. And I specifically stated the difference I made between losing and lost like 3 replies ago, and right when I did is when you said it doesn't mean you LOST. I'm not being subtle on anything lol.
---
It's not a rank thing, it's not a skill thing, I don't have a problem with any of the perks, like how many times do I have to explain it to you? Do you enjoy slyly boasting about how good you are in this discussion or something? Because skill isn't exactly the point I'm getting at when it comes to these 2 perks.
---
Carefully, he’s a hero
---
You ever try to run into a locker with quick and quiet but the garbage internet gets you stuck outside the locker and killed
---
You can still play wraith, but there will be some games he just can't win. If you want a character that can win no matter what it's up against, go billy, spirit, or nurse. If you want a character who is really solid but isn't quite at the top with the other killers id consider plague, pig, and freddy. (I struggled with where to put freddy because plenty will argue he's up there with billy now, but I feel he's just a little bit weaker.)
---
There’s literally a Michael Myers in the background 😂
---
Yesterday someone talked shit to me and accused me for camping when I teleported to gens close to hooks as Freddy.
---
This is actually a really good one.
---
Streamer man bad must use Mori and tunnel. Y’all really get triggered over ttv, huh?
---
Thanks man!
---
I don't think it's odd to complain about cosmetics, I think it's odd to claim stealth killers have bright ass cosmetics
---
Probably not, Blood Warden was about to wear off.
---
The blue and silver ones aren't bright. So he has one bright cosmetic, okay.
---
Hopefully she looks this good in game. Good job! :)
---
I stream on twitch and just find putting my name in my handle tacky. I have it in my steam profile discription if anyone clicks on my profile. As for streamers that get targeted at least it's a cool animation their chat gets to see
---
I hate Azarov’s. Often 3 gens on one side, 3 on the other and very little in the middle. You cant patrol both sides without Billy, so it often ends up being 3 gen strat or bust but then playing that way isnt fun for anyone.
---
*O I N K*
---
Feral Frenzy hits can be hard on console.
---
I should start using it. My brother uses it on almost every build. He says that it’s so satisfying when it comes into play that it’s worth all the games where it doesn’t help.
---
Thx! I wanna be better! :D
---
I wouldn't say it does nothing at all as you still occasionally get lobbies you belong in, that being said deranking sounds like a long boring process that ruins a lot of people's matches, so I wouldn't do it.
---
I think i make woman killers these days xP i prepare Hag and nurse too haha
---
Thx! wait for me come back! xD
---
On PTB - Wednesday. On live build - probably in 2 weeks after PTB starts.
---
Yes I only got the game a few weeks ago and I mainly play survivor
---
Basement bubba our prayers have been answered
---
Wdym its shit? Against player beads spirit its goid
---
&gt;  I don’t have twitch in my name though
---
You need to re-test
---
Im just happy someone decided to draw the pig. She needs more love.
---
Fair point, but what are the chances you'll get that? Not too common
---
Also r/ihadastroke
---
I thought I had escaped little big videos yet Here I am
---
At the end of the month almost.
---
I’d like to see it but the company that made Friday the 13th is now making a Predator game. So if you want your Predator fix you can buy that and enjoy it for a while before they screw it up with every patch until it’s a pile of shit.
---
Her perks are a little broken
---
Me: did I get iridescent, entity?
---
Entity: well yes, but actually no
---
Literally mad my day
---
Howdy fellow Jake main
---
Both Swamp maps at least give you something to work with, and some stealth opportunities. Shelter woods though, is imo the most difficult and killer sided map.
---
I had a typo. That's not a stroke if I mess up one word.
---
Also it's not only for that instance. 
---
What about Silent Billy?
---
Wraith?
---
Ghost Face?
---
Daddy Myers?
---
Pig?
---
Literally any silent addons or killer is countered with spine chill.
---
The past 3 games I have gone against pigs my head has exploded
---
Mother fucker THIS meme again!?
---
Yeah, they ran out not long after the claudette disconnected
---
This is true, i mostly play survivor and don’t have a ton of killer perks yet :(
---
I feel this way about The Game and Gideon - tracking is god awful on these maps because Whispers is constantly going off. I feel like Yamaoka, Haddonfield, The Game, and the Swamp all need slight reworks. I have no problem with a map being survivor-sided (I'm fine on Lery's and Coldwind tiles) but all four of the mentioned tiles lean too heavily toward survivors. Like, I admit I don't DC on Swamp maps - but if I get Yamaoka, Haddonfield, or Gideon I immediately DC because I know I'm not going to have fun in the game.  
---
... that being said, if the survivors burn an offering for one of those three maps I immediately find my Ruin totem and stand there, staring at my totem, and let them do gens.
---
Yeah, it only works for me about 1/3 of the time, and that’s only if the exit gates are powered in the first place. But when it does work, it is just the best thing ever.
---
Silent chainsaw addons. Also you know you could not use Pig's dash attack and just get up normally while still having no Terror Radius for the first couple seconds.
---
no shit repost are great for the mods team. Post about important game issues is not interesting tho.
---
It's kinda hard to hit Feral Frenzy hits on 360ing survivors. And you get punished super hard for missing a hit.
---
Dbd isnt competitive in the slightest.
---
Well I just had the same face Camping LF 4 times in a row, so I'll take some of your F's
---
Eerrr herrrr HERRRRRRR!
---
I need this, but set to yakety sax.
---
I don't want that either but Spirit standing still han 0 counterplay
---
I got this same glitch the other day vs a sprit. Killer thought I was hacking. I think it might have something to do with the status effects and receiving a sprint boost at the same time cause I was hit by the killer as my sprint burst went off and she had sloppy butcher (so like 3 status effects popped up all at once) I’ve seen someone else get it too in a different game (I play on PC) so it seems pretty common I’m surprised this is the first post I’ve seen about it.
---
Still the best killer on console
---
Being favorable is inevitable. And that's fine, trying to say this without sounding arrogant but I consider myself to be a pretty good trapper and the massive difference in end result between my matches at swamp vs everywhere else is obscene.  
---
Map synergy and knowledge are good things that exist,  but on the counter point matches should not be practically hopeless based on random selection
---
"Balanced"  but at least he's funner to play against than spirit and nurse.
---
😂😂😂 I say that I could care less because I could really care less LMAO
---
These idiots are hampering the growth of their own game by discouraging them from streaming. Not every guy with TTV in their name is toxic, hell most of them can be pretty chill. But you know how this sub can be, once a circlejerk gets going, it's hard to stop it no matter how right or wrong it is.
---
No, only on the 4th, as far as I know
---
I've been seeing a lot of blood warden posts lately. Might ive it a spin with Freddy till it becomes teachable
---
It’ll get better with dedicated servers. Most of those unfair hits are just latency issues.
---
Mhm, yes, but if you wanna know if their looking at you just run that other perk I can't spell.
---
Spine chill hinders you with the increased chance of a skill check and reduced skill check zone, if they buffed it so the "2% increased action speed while active" to "additional 2% increased action speed when activated" then I would run it
---
But until then I still think it's a bad perk
---

Yeah, but I'm still too busy running botney, SC, dead hard and mettle of man
---
That's not even a social media, and besides your special ED teacher is looking for you
---
I have always though that wouldn't it be cool if somewhere on each map there is 1 special locked chest and to open it you would need to find a key somewhere (Rework the green key into this one key that would be able to open the locked chest) And inside you would find any item with 2 random addons..
---
Im upset that i recognise the right face from more memes than the actual show
---
Yeah win or lose people get toxic in this game either way, it’s wack
---
Dope as hell OP ✌️
---
Ok.
---
It’s only 7 seconds that’s nothing
---
X
---
Ok let's call it "a game in which you're playing against other real people to win", multiplayer or whatsoever. The idea is, that on contrary to single-player games, you do compete against real people here, so 2 things are implied by default:
---
1. You will loose sometimes depending on many factors such as skillgap, presets or maybe pure luck
---
2. People are gonna act differently. It's not bots, people wanna communicate, and each and everyone will do it in their own way
---
"Multiplayer" is a term that's more vague about these things, because multiplayer can be also strictly cooperative, and I wanted to underline the factor of competition for win.
---
Not really...the wraith has literally all dark skins ... Like basically every killer has dark skins? What it should say is "the killer whos gunna be seen anyway cuz of premonition or terror radius anyways vs the survivors who are supposedly supposed to hide around the map"
---
r/woooosh
---
Makes sense.
---
Yea I stopped running SC and DH. SC with sloppy butcher takes too long and for some reason I just stopped running exhaustion perks in general. If you want to try my build out for my Claudette it's

Plag against most survivors you don’t ever use get it
---
&gt; Survivors doing actions that specifically have no purpose other than to annoy /BM another person
---
&gt; In game actions that still require playing like you normally would. Especially since more people seem to define tunneling as 'Killer exists on the same map as me
---
Yea, completely comparable. If some wanna-be Twitch Super-star wants to use complete strangers to generate content and $, then thy have to accept that not everyone else in the game exists solely to help them with that.
---
It’s 2 days before Friday, idiots
---
No, look up Fungoose. He’s a much better survivor than Noob. All I’ve seen Noob do is loop low rank killers. Fungoose is a killer main w 7k hours but that in turn makes him a godly survivor main too. You can check his VODs, he also has educational games on YouTube
---
Holy shit Tom 72hrs? He used to play DBD? TIL
---
Killer could be a clicker
---
Cause this Reddit community is downvoted happy. Instead of downvoting something that is disrespectful or rude. They downvoted something that either they disagree with (doesn't even have to be anything big) or just do it for the hell of it.
---
If it glows it goes.
---
Complaining about a killer not using their power? Survivor mains really confuse me sometimes.
---
im so glad there isnt a chat feature on console. i stopped playing pc because of the toxicity and have more fun playing on ps4. i do occasionally get a message thanking me for being a cool killer (i.e. if there is a disconnect or 2 i let them farm) but havent really gotten any for killing them proper
---
How the turns have tabled
---
DH has come in clutch for me in just about every match I've been in and SC I've run into multiple occasions where I need it yet don't have it
---
I don't *really* like to run meta perks, I just go with what I can rely on to help myself as well as the team
---
Also, I sometimes run We're Gonna Live Forever
---
Circle? And make drop Left arrow?
---
wait...thats Not how this works
---
That's weird. I bought Leatherface nearly immediately after I installed the game, and I occasionally still get his Splinters. They did seem to stop giving me Pig's when I bought her's, though.
---
Wraith has dark skins too thats what i dont get about this post like what are ppl talking about? Every killer has a dark cosmetic other than the like cannible. Pig has a dark costume now... Im like homestly lost. Spirit has a brown darker costume as well but honestly whos trynna blemd in the map woth spirit its like pointless thats like blending in with hag? Their designed to jumpscare if they blend in or not. Not to mention why are killers trying to blend in unless they ghost face or pig?
---
Going to edit to clarify, but my general point that I failed to mention was that I've literally seen every reason under the sun for mori's, including gender. *No*, I'm not kidding.
---
Obviously most of them do it to try to get a reaction, but that's just like any player in any multiplayer game ever, where you're going to have some portion of the community that just wants to make people salty/upset/triggered/whatever.
---
Also maybe to prevent BBQ
---
Oh, you were using the /royal/ we. Gotcha.
---
Some people are just miserable people.
---
When dbd was on the golden era
---
I'd use one of the buttons on the back for deadhard so you can have full control over movement+camera when in a chase
---
Thus is the third time I see a Doctor fucking toxic survivors with BW today, keep at it
---
I get you
---
Pig can crouch and be steal- Big red trench coat :)))))
---
Crackhead Quentin looks more like Jonathon IMO
---
dae killermains bad?
---
It's jut funny, it's not toxic at all
---
Didn't the actor for Quentin want to be in the game, but something prevented him from doing it?
---
Yeah, that was the joke ahahah
---
this is pretty good dude. hope the devs see it
---
Did you just blind him in the dick
---
No judgement just curious as to why? Do you not like streamers or does having either of those in their name just trigger you?
---
Bet you if you used your chainsaw more they'd talk trash in you for having no chase skill and needing the one hit down to do anything
---
You are allowed to have an option, and we are allowed to downvote that opinion.
---
Aren’t*
---
i do window fakes all the time but they be expecting that shit man i always die
---
Prob were looking in a random direction, heard the audio queue, and kept looking.
---
Adrenaline is a bullshit perk lol, saves you from Tier 3 Michael and Noed too.
---
i feel. ill try that ive had it work for friends
---
*Basement Wraith*
---
Quintin only wears a few outfits in the movie, which is the main reason why this outfit could actually work.
---
If you have bt and you kobe, do you get the bt effect?
---
Bow down and worship your new god
---
Anytime the last survivor kobes, I try to down them and either carry them to hatch or the exit gates. You've gotta respect the 4%.
---
red ranks suck thats where i am. all u get is killers that proxy or use their trash wifi to their advantage. i like being so far down tho that it doesnt matter if i just dc
---
I can understand that Hillbilly is very strong and should get nerfed. But saying that *all* of the one hit powers should be removed is just stupid. 
---
Leatherface’s instadown is very hard to get, and he gets punished heavily if he hits a wall.
---
Myers’s instadown requires you to be stalked to tier 3, which takes time. Plus it only lasts for 60 seconds. It’s strong but definitely not OP.
---
Ghostface’s power can literally be taken away from him by revealing him. Lots of people say his reveal mechanic is broken, but I honestly have no problem revealing him as survivor.
---
Grim Pantry: vault killer shack window - balanced landing off deck - run to main building gg ez outplayed baby killer
---
One day the devs might fix the broken aspects of maps like the main disturbed ward building and the god windows on maps like ironworks and torment creek. but nah they decided to nerf pallets instead
---
Oh how the turntables
---
thats what im thinking
---
But he aged 40 years on dbd since the movie
---
"only using mori for daily" honestly man, it shouldn't matter. Moris are in the game so it's fine to use them if you feel like it. It's not like you can use them every game or even most games. Survivors have instaheals, BNP, keys, all things that spice the games up a bit, but might not necessarily be balanced.
---
How what?
---
if you put spinechill in the last perk slot it goes on top and youll see out of your peripheral
---
I think it’s the other way round
---
I got 37 with Meg and got all my perks (SB, AD, SC, DS) back to lvl3.
---
I'm just imagining these killers flying across the map at billy speed with these buffs lol
---
Great Guides!

They didn't claim to make it so no need to remove
---
if you make it as tiny of a distance as spine chill it wouldn’t be super hard. plus without the auras if it were say up to 70 meters and it would go off it would work more like a handicap because you wouldn’t know if they’re super far or right there
---
Killers don't automatically deserve anything. Just like survivors. The Myers wasn't entitled to a kill and this bug basically makes survivors auto win. And this is coming from a killer main.
---
It still costs money though
---
Twitch streamers when the Trapper steps in his own trap
---
this comment was downvoted
---
Yeah I guess but it’s just too rng based for my taste. You could go across the map and escape or exit the opposite locker and die. I admit it’s probably better than i gave it credit for but I personally wouldn’t take it over deliverance or ds.
---
i’m saying if they have a small terror radius or you don’t yet know who the killer is you might be running around for no reason because you think they’re right there. it should be a smaller distance
---
As a killer main I wouldn’t even be upset over this, it’s just too impressive.
---
Was it improved? Sort of. Some hexes are insanely impossible to find, in between 4 bushes and around a 90 degree corner that is smaller than most trees that you can't pass through. See those are good. Too bad those are always my dull totems, and my ruin will always spawn in the middle of Africa where everyone can see. Like in some cornfield.
---
R3
---
Nah none of these are good enough we need sometimes better for them
---
fr bro way too many fucking rainbow maps
---
It's worse when you run HG as well and somehow they always hit ruin instead of HG for 9 games in a row
---
I feel this on a spiritual level
---
I dont care if you screen watch my stream. I have all of 10 followers and mostly stream for my friends who cant get in on SWF when we are at max (or they think the game is scary lol). 
---
I've met some nice people on my stream afterwards.
---
Well no shit, they wanna try the new stuff
---
can anyone explain how to get protection hits reliably?
---
I know that taking a hit while the killer is transporting a survivor grants one while healthy, but apparently not when you're injured? Or is there some kind of cooldown on taking protection hits? How close do you have to be to another survivor in a chase to take a hit and get a protection scoring event?
---
This seems like the mods are trying to hide issues people have with the game. If we're talking oversaturated surely there's FAR more garbage memes posts about shirtless Myers, Darn Freddy and other recurring garbage memes a guy uses MSPaint to make in less than a minute. 
---
Why not just create a separate sub dedicated to memes and other bullshit and leave this one to talk about the actual game itself and all of the good and bad that goes with it?
---
Methed out Tony Hawk
---
what
---
I never new people hated spirit so much
---
Every one shot killer is pretty meh. One shot addons are fucking OP. I do think billy is the model killer though, he is fun to play as and against.
---
 he doesnt have many super annoying add-ons (insta saw im looking at you.) and i dont run into many asshole players using him,those people only play easy killers like clown and spirit. He takes skill but can be played by beginners.
---
Wouldn’t Ghostface be mad or irritated though lol. Or same something like oh well you’re in a horror movie now or some shit like that lol. 
---
I’ve seen stranger things as well.
---
The only way to rank up is to play with your food, hook people over and over, chase them, stab them, use your ability, etc. Going for a straight easy 4k won't do much to your rank if you just hook all once.
---
I was chasing the last one
---
oo ok thank you for the information, i was a little confused about it
---
Realistically he’s about mid tier. A lot of new players like him though, so when they get destroyed they blame it on him rather than their own inexperience
---
And then you lose because you are bad at the game.  It's the circle of toxic gaming.  
---
I'll show this person who is expressing their love for a game I also enjoy.  How dare they.

The ace main in me is furious with this image.

Ah, that’s right, I forgot the animation changed.

i just started playing on tuesday. i’m trying to figure out which killer suits my playstyle. i enjoy just bluntly running into the action, but i also enjoy playing smart and stealthy. setting up traps or waiting to pounce isn’t really fun for me. who would be the best for me?
---
Maybe y’all should be more competitive
---
Gee how interesting it is to watch someone get camped for a minute and then get booted out of the match the moment they get off. 
---
All the fun you can get out of that just oozes out of the screen.
---
Guess she really didn't want to get healed by me :(
---
Make it L or R
---
Well, considering they're likely to bitch about anything I do, mori or no mori, might as well bring out the big guns. Because apparently killers aren't allowed to have fun if someone is streaming in their game.
---
I’m a rank 10 playing 10and below and I’m still getting 4K’s come at me
---
Bruh
---
How did this game go? Sounds like it wasn’t in his favor
---
I’ve managed to get into a chase and injure someone before the match ended due to a disconnect on loading.
---
I just want to play my favorite survivor without any exceptions. Like i dont want them to change Nea to where she is super broken and everyone thinks im just playing for ez meta game, but i also dont want to play a survivor that has the worst stats (You know there is going to be a few survivors with stats that help the killer)
---
Trapper I feel would be the kind of guy that would either hit perfect skill checks, or blow the gen, nothing in between.
---
Pig would be the type of person to just sit on gens all game, and leave. Never unhook, never heal, just genrush like hell.
---
Ghostface is hardcore the person that Urban Evades the entire map and avoids gens because they mess them up and the killer will find them.
---
Clown is probably the guy who'd do meme builds that border on being asshole builds (Omega stun with DS out of locker and Head On comes to mind)
---
I didn’t  perceive you sayingit as bad either....
---
i’m literally yelling rn

White chest

We live in a bottom text

What
---
Do u know how long I’m gonna have to wait for that, hear me out, it’s not like everyone has all day to play games, some people work
---
she just sucks, i'd rather vs a nurse
---
I'm confused hatch only.oppens if 3 people are dead or someone has key
---
r/TaylorSwift
---
"I used the free win offering and ONE survivor got lucky, pity me"
---
They can be brutal. But nothing longer than 10 minutes typically.
---
What does the “no one escapes death” perk do?
---
U had one job
---
I just hit level 69! Nooooooo!
---
It was a 4 man swf he hooked his teammate I came back and killed him then his teammate in hooked him and I hatcheted both of them
---
I win, so I am playing the game properly, y’all are just bad for getting downed
---
I've never really used moris all that much save for when I have a daily and I don't tunnel unless I need to (I try to play optimally instead of just camping or purposely trying to play "fair") but in one of my lobbies I got a SWF that were all playing bill with TTV in their names. I threw on the mori because I thought it'd be funny, they had a good time too and they were pretty chill
---
I personally think this is awesome but like the other posts with killers hiding as a survivor, I don’t think it would work well against a 4 person swf  but it would definitely work against solo survivors which I would love to see in this game (I am a solo survivor) because it’s not super powerful but it’s enough to have fun against newer players during rank resets and when u know ur lobby is not a swf!
---
Ps I love how much detail you put into this concept felt like it was a character the devs abandoned. =)
---
bro i have eye twitches and basically rely on the sound so i can stop wigging out for one second to do the skill check and i always miss them with lullaby
---
Another one
---
Usually between 2 and 5 minutes, in my case. You may be more lucky, but it depends on your connection.
---
Fan of the work you put into it and doesn't seem too op or anything. Only gripe is we already have a female killer that uses a axe so BHVR might not want two.
---
I have been trying to get streamers to try this build for the last couple months. Glad it's spreading!
---
#THIS PLEASES THE QUENTIN MAINS
---
Ah i see the good ol case of “I lost so you must be hacking” I swear some survivors think they are the next coming of Christ himself.
---
If you have eyes  and ears you dont need spinechill
---
Nah it's always about the same. While higher level do give more shards per level they also take more XP to reach.
---
Hugh, I’ve found less proxy killers where I’m at, most trouble coming from teammates who got to this rank by Doing gens and hiding in corners.
---
[https://youtu.be/wKDBOB6UWKo?t=111](https://youtu.be/wKDBOB6UWKo?t=111)
---
Mettle is BETTER than solidarity bro. Just think about the protection hits your getting with No Mither.
---
Welcome to DBD this is more common then you think. If it’s a doctor with ruin and unnerving presence you can guarantee a quad DC.
---
1. Being a rank 10 literally means nothing, so idk why you’re flexing it like you’re cool bc of it or something
---
2. Rank 10 is even less impressive bc you just said you facecamp and tunnel to get wins. A 8 year old can win games camping and tunneling, play how you want but don’t act good when you play like a dweeb. 
---
3. Competitive players know how to take losses and get better from it, they don’t cry about it like a baby or take shortcuts like camping so they brag about their rank and how much they win.
---
Please be bait...?
---
The Pig one alone makes me want to slap you. 10 second timer and no form of removing the trap? You deserve to be slapped for that idea alone.
---
Give the trapper 30 heavy ass bear traps to carry around? Oh yeah let’s just change his name to ‘Pack Mule’ it’s genius. Maybe give him two automatically and I can see it. Another figurative slap on the head with a newspaper for this one too.
---
And the Wraith one....Jesus fucking Christ you are literally insane.
---
I’m assuming you still ride your bike with training wheels with these ideas and attitude. 
---
Hard, HAAAARD pass.
---
I have over 1400k hours, but I suck with acronyms. What's"BM?"
---
As a killer for me, it takes usually 2-3 minutes
---
As a survivor, it takes usually 5-10 minutes. Don't know if the ranks influence anything
---
All videos and I watch his streams. But Fungoose is still better
---
I 100% DC on toxic killers. Why should they be rewarded for camping and tunneling?
---
BHVR won't do anything about it so I will. Idc about my rank. I'm gonna depip anyway for not being able to get anything done. Might as well make him suffer too.
---
relatable
---
Wheres the up votes?
---
Oh dude, its in the rulebook for killers that you are not allowed to take advantage of any mistake a survivor might make
---
You’re blind then if you think he’s only looping and 360 low level killers
---
How do you loop a killer? I'm usually a gen Jockey  that rely on stealth &amp; playing passively. Is there a strategy or perks I could run to help with my looping?
---
He does loop high rank killers so I‘m wrong on that but the point is Fungoose is better
---
What is a tombstone myers?
---
I wanna upvote but its at 420 
---
It also makes the killer faster.
---
Bad manners. Just Bad and toxic behaviour in general.
---
I did not. I don't usually read all through comment chains while I am at work, but I can do that in a little bit
---
Practice and a good connection honestly. You should know the extreme importance of pallets and you really dont wanna waste really good ones (god pallet) unless you're injured or its the only way to not being injured. You can loop a good pallet for a solid minute and be able to go to another one which, if having a good team, could be several gens.
---
From what you’ve said, Spirit would be your best option. You enjoy stealth, but you don’t like waiting to pounce. Myers and Ghostface both utilise this a lot, so they’re kinda off the table for you. So yeah- Spirit sounds about right for you.
---
Can you post a pic or a link to a pic of that combo? I thought about trying it but I cant mix and match without buying.
---
**Video ends**
---
I’m guessing it’s because it’s a chance to humiliate a streamer live, or maybe it’s referencing a strat new players do where they open twitch mobile and snipe them
---
When the last generator pops, a Dull Totem on the map is randomly selected to become the Totem for the Hex. This Hex marks all survivors as Exposed (one hit will down them) and gives a movement speed boost to the killer. This effect will last until the Totem is cleansed.
---
If there's no Dull Totems left then nothing happens.
---
It is an item for Myers that allows him to mori people while in the T3 stage of his stalking ability.
---
#DARN
---
bro there's a Myers in the background I just saw it. very cool and creepy! Updoot!
---
Ps4 main here. For survivor it usually take 2-4 minutes and killer its been 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Sometimes the wait times can be up to 5 minutes or more, depending on the time of day and if a release just happened. After Ghost face dropped, wait time for a killer was over 5 minutes but a survivor was almost instant. Also you can get Dead By Daylight Deluxe physical copy in a game store for $20 and you get 2 extra killers (doctor and hag) and a survivor (Feng)
---
@BHVR Glorious white Pig outfits when
---
From the starting line-up, Nurse.
---
I generally check out peoples twitch channels if they have TTV in their name.

Understood, but OP's case is different and that's what the other commenters are talking about

No it's taken on a nokia you baboon

That explains why they break in two good kicks

I got that but for pallets

what are the best add ons for bubba and freddy? just so i can know which add ons are worth getting in the bloodweb
---
If it's against the rules then a mod will remove it. You're not one, so I'm not going to take it down just because you say so.
---
Shitpost tag
---
I actually feel bad for Spirit as shes only there because she was murdered and mostly everypne else is straight up evil
---
wtf, that was a meme..
---
This is so sad alexa play spaghettios
---
Im the same way, who doesnt want to see themselves on TV??
---
I fucking love the doctor. The shock therapy kind of lets you play by your own rules
---
Yeah. I talk shit on other killer mains becauss I have had MULTIPLE GAMES at rank 9 not using ruin/NOED/BBQ/nurse's or any of the other top tier perks and 4 manned.
---
If you're not garbage, even against SWF you should be able to get at least 2 kills. The killers in this game are babies. End of story
---
It takes balls to break those barefoot like Wraith does...
---
Legacy 3’s scare me
---
&gt;MEND RECOVER AND LEAVE THROUG THE EXIT.
---
What?
---
I think im a mix of 2 and 1 although i dont tend to be toxic i can be very spiteful ab do petty shit sometimes (like bodyblocking a dwight a while back for wasting a pallet) but only if im in a bad mood
---
Normally I'd agree, a challenge is nice. But when I'm trying to play wraith and I get bullied with borrowed time and flashlight shenanigans it doesn't feel too good :(
---
Toolboxes really?
---
You round corners really well
---
Don’t know about Freddy but bubba you need to ALWAYS get primer bulbs when you see them. Also award winning chili is very good.
---
Im gonna do whats called a pro gamer move
---
That's when you switch to a strong killer or you just deal with it and try to kill at least 2. The worst map in the game is without question Haddonfield for a variety of reasons:
---
Survivors have an insane number of places to hide. 
---
Most gens are either in houses or behind houses and walls and unless you're using a stealth killer or Nurse it's incredibly difficult to get close enough to them before they run off.
---
Pallet and window placement can be cancer.
---
And the houses. Dear god, the houses. If a guy has Balanced Landing they get away. Bamboozle cannot save the day either because if you take away one window there's a 2nd or even 3rd window in the 2nd floor of the same house so unless they're stupid and not paying attention they'll run right back inside the house and use another window. 
---
Haddonfield is the epitome of cancer and if I see survivors using a offering for I disconnect right there. There's no ifs ands or buts you are in for a bad time with Haddonfield. Even Freddy or Spirit can't do much about Haddonfield. You'd think the gen teleport with Freddy would be good in houses with gens but all they have to do is hop out a window with a patio and wait. If you appear they drop down. If you don't they'll just go right back to their gen and finish it. It cannot be overstated just how horrible the map is. I hope to fucking god they are addressing Haddonfield soon. There's other bad maps with issues (to say the least) but Haddonfield takes the cake. 
---
Disturbed Ward is maybe the 2nd worst map but killers with anti loop abilities and Billy can kind of deal with it. 
---
Grim Pantry didn't used to be that bad until some idiot at Behavior decided to add that little pier in the corner of the map. And then they decided that small two structure should have its doors randomly be open or a gen near it can open the doors. So now Grim Pantry has 3 bad loop spots counting Shack. 
---
The funny thing is that the cancer loop spots wouldn't be bad if they just removed the window vaults in those spots. That's all they have to do but they refuse to do it... Yet.
---
oh my god its a hiding survivor? i literally thought he was dribbling a basketball this entire time
---
Toolboxes -&gt; really fast gens -&gt; short game -&gt; no fun
---
I would recommend nurse because she can just pop out of the blue and chase pretty well and essentially ignore loops, but just a warning that she is very difficult to start playing, so I would recommend playing some other killer before you try to play her. It took me a decent amount of games for me to be able to competently play her and be able to blink (her ability to teleport) efficiently
---
I like to Mori streamers.  In fact I don't mind being Mori'd  instead of 3rd Hooked.    
---
I always laugh when I mori a streamer though, call it "professional courtesy."
---
&gt; Get smacked while killer is carrying a survivor
---
So this is the one that I'm confused over. Last night I was trying to take two hits this way and just accepting going down but the second hit would not proc a protection scoring event.
---
Thanks i hate it &lt;3
---
Good: this
---
Better: 3 Pwyf 
---
Best: 5 stacks Devour Soap
---
H O L Y S H I T Y O U N E E D J E S U S
---
&gt; Apparently, nobody plays to actually have fun. Ever.
---
Welcome to DBD subreddit. If you don't 4K or escape it's impossible to have fun.
---
If I'm killer I am paying my way for my fun I'm not going to have less fun just because someone didn't get a chance to play this game
---
Musta been 2011 when the world ended
---
I thought it was borrowed time too, but dwight doesn’t have it.  
---
Someone else replied to me saying you’re invincible for a very short time after getting unhooked.
---
"Ain't face camping if the gates are powered"
---
&gt; Not true there is usually at least one strong totem spot on all the maps.
---
The new Badham maps have almost only god tier totem spawns. No other map has it that way. And the strongest spawns on any other map is not as good as the Badham ones.
---
This is a fact. It is inarguable
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
The problem is, you waste a lot of time, 15 seconds are a lot, yeah you could wait but what if the gates are open? They could make it 10 seconds and it would still be the same, but then even if you manage to down them, they still have DS, just imagine if the killer had DS, basically if you got hooked 20 or less seconds ago and you get unhooked, you get back on the hook, but make it 4 because there are 4 survivors. Ruin is a must if you don't want to have 2 minutes games, and no one runs lightborn unironically, even if Franklin's is a counter to items, you still can get back and take it, it won't be hard. Also you can till have 3 survivors alive, 1 gen left and get all of them to escape through hatch.
---
Then lagging back to behind the pallet and getting killed.
---
I've never even heard of that, ur WiFi is probably just bad
---
god forbid you call them out on it and their loyal dickriders try to bandwagon attack you.
---
I don't think there's been any talk from the devs on the matter, but I agree with you fully, the other day I was lumped in with Rank 20 teammates and a rank 9 Legion, imagine my pain.
---
Hope more people watch thi series, its so good.
---
He's right if the game or devs dont say it's wrong then it's not wrong it's like getting mad become people dont use your house rules
---
I use it often as well :)
---
I mean, what's the alternative?
---
At least if felt like it at the time
---
Yep. I'm just entitled
---
Bro how did you get spine chill as a passive?
---
I'm perplexed. With enough practice almost anyone can 4K at rank 9, with any killer and any perks. Your metric is way off. Without running the risk of falling into the gatekeeper reddit: get to rank 1, come back and then we can talk.
---
For the record and in vague support of your point; I play up to rank 1 with no ruin, noed or nurses (why wouldn't you want BBQ, screw the meta it's double BP baby) and it's like swallowing a handful of thumbtacks.
---
Do you tunnel? just to be clear I am a killer and yesI do tunnel
---
Well if you do to hurt the killer not only are you hurting yourself you are also hurting your teammates by dcing you might not care but your teammates do
---
really? for ps4 survivor queue takes ages while killer takes about 25 seconds
---
Yeah nah dude the queue time for killer is always like 5 to 10 minutes.
---
The wraith fears nothing...
---
It depends. Right after a new chapter, 5-10 mins but maybe shorter for Stranger Things since Dedicated Servers and a lot more people will play as survivors. A few weeks after and at night is the best time where it takes 1-3 mins. Hopefully that helps.
---
I’d take that Pig buff if it was real.
---
With the current state of Huntress hitboxes...Huntress is 2nd worst to play against. Just terrible. Nurse is always the worst.
---
The gates were open and he knew the other survivor was there for the save, what was he supposed to do?
---
To be fair dbd is a team based ranking game with a strong side v side mentality I can understand why people get competitive.
---
Meg got her heelies on
---
Ah thank you 😊
---
Right. Its ridiculous to say that adrenaline or perks like BBQ require you to "do well." They are naturally going to occure almost every game so saying the perks require work doesnt make any sense
---
I think there is a better way to counter Devour Hope.
---
The only difference between rank 9 and rank 1 is more people play SWF to counter the 3 killers everyone plays.
---
I'm probably not the person to answer but for Freddy I would always for for the sketches for the shorter teleport time and paint thinner/prototype claws for the pallets. Most people will say snares are better and more than likely they are right, I just don't know how to use them and the pallets almost never fail me.
---
Perfectly fine. The person saying they reach 10 minutes... I dunno. That's just blatantly false. Maybe unless you're playing at 3 AM on Christmas or something
---

If it’s that rough, you have to recognize you can’t win them all. Like when I get tunneled to shit for no reason, I just sit back and realize this is strategic for the killer as much as it sucks and take the L. Or when someone is facecamped by a leatherface or billy, not much to be done. No counterplay whatsoever.
---
I agree, the perks are strong, but I was just giving examples of simple counterplay. You can’t always counter everything. Just like you can’t always find the 5th totem to prevent NOED or find the ruin totem until late game. I play killer and survivor pretty evenly, I know NOED is a game changer, and it can be fun for killer, but I know I didn’t earn it. It can flip a 4-man escape into a 3 or 4K.
---
U\_U
---
I agree with the rule changes, but retroactively removing posts hardly seems fair.
---
And not all teabagging is toxic. Same with this, that was a well deserved headshake.
---
It depends on what is your reward for example I just like to kill so I tend to tunnel and put people in har positions sometimes this means I camp.
---
 However if the reward is BP the camping is discouraged and if your reward is to out chase people then yes both tactics do not help.
---
I used to hate Shelter Woods but I don't anymore. If you're using a killer that can counter loops it isn't too bad. If you're running Enduring + Spirit Fury it's much easier. It can be hard for Hag because of her slow movement and the size of the map and the way it's designed can be difficult in terms of finding the right places to trap and being close enough to teleport.
---
eh, I actually prefer nurse to spirit by a long shot. Nurse is more interactive to vs at least. She's stronger due to pure map pressure but Spirit can just die honestly LOL.  
---
Huntress hatchets can suck ass but they're not always that bad so on a larger scale, screw spirit.
---
just don't get hit 4head
---
Yeha I also play survivor and I know NOeD is strong, and I dont use it, but the few times I played without good perks and I used it, almost every match NOeD didn't activate, I can't do anything for camping tho, that's basically teabagging and flashlight clicking but on the killer side, it's just plain out toxic
---
Dead by Fortnite
---
Edit: ill downvote myself. Just more proof killer mains in this game are mostly crybabies who dont want to be called out on their bullshit. Wah wah wah
---
I'd like to see t posing post and tier list added, but it's a step in the right direction for subreddit health.
---
Chase the other person away and force them out the exit gate? It doesn't take that big of a brain. Players easily give up on saves if pressured enough.
---
You are not the sharpest tool in the shed apparently.
---
Really?? At red ranks the huntress and nurse players are just way too good. I know they both take skill, spirit takes less, but those hatchet hitboxes suck. 
---
Spirit I can circle back. Mindfuck. Juke. Etc
---
For Bubba it's the Carburettor Tuning Guide and Primer Bulb, AKA the "instasaw". It means you can very quickly down survivors without having to suffer the slowdown involved with "charging" the saw.
---
For Fred... the pallet add-ons are popular, Nancy's Sketch/Masterpiece can be brutal if you're running Make Your Choice, the Ropes and Swing Chains are solid if you're keeping people asleep. If you're keeping people awake then most of the add-ons aren't doing anything for you - I would be wary of relying on anything connected to Skill Checks.
---
Yeah except it didn’t, before. 🙄
---
And honestly on this subreddit it’s really really hard to tell if posts like these are serious or not.
---
I didn’t downvote you I didn’t even see it until just now
---
You lost all credibility with “easy killers like clown and spirit”. Nowhere in history have those two ever been equated. Got guud.
---
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to name him, but there is a big streamer who is also a fog whisperer whose killer main is literally Insidious basement Bubba.
---
She's got the zoomies
---
I second this. Spirit isn’t really that fun. I’d rather go against an omega blink nurse with ruin and infectious than spirit tbh.
---
Not really, that only really works when the Spirit makes mistakes. With nurse you can at least jump into lockers and etc.
---
The difference is that Nurse gives you information to react to, it's a mindgame. Spirit is just pure guessing and gives survivors no information whatsoever.
---
It can suck to get stomped by a Nurse but at least she earned it tbh.
---
Also forfeiting all the points they earned in the match. Hurting yourself to spite somebody else is pathetic
---
also disclaimer since i was being pretty toxic at the end, i’m so used to getting shit red rank killers that camp every hook because that’s what got them to red rank, i didn’t expect match making to be this bad.
---
ive had it happen to me a few times. theres a way to set it up i think.
---
Playing the game properly means giving survivors a chance. You could do that if wouldn’t be shit at the game
---
 I think that valve has some way that the prices of the regions cant skipped
---
I hate when that shit happens.  How the fuck can the devs not fix it...
---
Awesome!
---
Any tips for juking the spirit when she's in that spirit mode? Should I just be running somewhere else when she goes into that mode?
---
Craziness here. I swear haha. Omega nurse is just dumb. Her base two blink is fine for a good driver to smash a team of red ranks. 
---
Spirit can struggle with the right survivor team.
---
This ain't twitch chat.
---
Stealth killer? Get Nurse's Calling. If not a stealth killer get Enduring
---
I'm a rank 20 killer trying to practice chasing and keep getting like, 11, 10s, 5s...
---
Jonathan's perk is beating the shit out of the killer.
---
my favorite meme today thank u
---
Myers: *’Mom said it’s my turn with the flashlight.’*
---
I just thought it was good copy pasta lol
---
It's a DUB
---
I had this same thing happen to me.  It eventually fixes itself if you let the exhaustion go all the way down, but yeah sprint burst is broke... again.
---
She can only see scratch marks, so start walking. Same with hiding. Or, get at a vault/pallet and wait for her to pop out.
---
Sure omega blink is broken but I was just saying how I find that more fun than a spirit.
---
wow
---
Sept 5th
---
Dumb Freddy question here. I know previously that putting survivors to sleep would slow their action speed. Does the same apply to new Freddy or does it just make them susceptible to his traps?
---
A perk to counter a single rare add-on on a single killer isn’t really worth it. Otherwise you can do just fine with eyes and ears. Ghostface has to be visible to stalk, and he makes kinky leather sounds. Myers has to be visible to stalk and you can hear his breathing within 8 metres. Wraith can still be seen if he’s moving. Pig has a roar before the dash attack and most gens are situated so she can’t uncrouch right behind you. Spine chill isn’t a good perk, just one that makes some players feel more comfortable
---
*badum crash*
---
10 bucks? :D  
---
I mean it's not even real money it's steam money :D
---
there are add-ons to slow action speed. It is no longer part of his base kit
---
I thought this bug was fixed
---
Where are these teammates when I'm solo queuing...?
---
These sound ridiculously powerful
---
A lot of Spirits can't handle if you double back.
---
I think he's talking about not being able to escape.
---
No I hear you, just disagree unless you want to talk the prayer beads spirit. Prayer beads and Iri hatchet are instant DC. Just dumb.
---
I don't have to, I play spirit and clown ;)
---
If you don’t have Iron Will you need to be unpredictable because she can still hear you and see your scratchmarks.
---
well then...
---
I was pretty sure that was the case but not 100% sure. Much appreciated!
---
Idk, looks like a typical medstudent for me
---
I mean even if they would try, they wouldn't be able to fuck it up more badly...
---
Yeah I honestly have started playing more killer to try and help other survivors get games faster.  Got to red ranks last season and am still a fairly new killer at rank 7.  You can learn so much about how to be effective by playing both sides.
---
Can’t have a rank 2 without ruin and noed gotta love it.
---
Hitting Meg after the unhook was his only option. If he went for Dwight the both would have gotten out.
---
It's crazy how we live in two different worlds, I'm a rank 16 survivor main and keep getting 7's and 9's. To add salt to injury I'm always getting an annoying killer like Legion or Clown.
---
Happy to help ^^
---
Where!? I see people whining about Nurse all the time, even Doctor a few times, never a Legion complaint except that they're very M1.
---
I was honestly surprised I scored 15000 points that game seeing how it went so quick.
---
I'm a bad bitch, you cant kill me!
---
Aha, yeah that happened to me once. Except I was the Meg. Can't remember what killer it was though. It was on PS4.
---
Looks like you're already qualified.
---
Who was the killer?
---
Yeah I kind off agree. But atleast with these perks you need to do your objective to activate. With NOED, old ds and old mettle of man for example that wasn't the case
---
*doesn’t get a skill check for half the gen*
---
*itches* 
---
DIIIING
---
She definitely should have been out of that window though. It's a very inconsistent mechanic.
---
At rank 1? DC.
---
If you facecamp for no reason or the reason beeing ''he looped me'' you should maybe play another game, you won't get past rank 16 anyways
---
This looks great! Also I just realized she stands on her toes lmao
---
The best Bubba build is Insta-Saw. Not taking any perk builds into play Tuning Guide and Primer Bulb means you have no time to react as a survivor. 
---
Freddy’s strongest build, personally is Jump Rope/Swing Chains. Even by itself you slow gen speed so much it’s disgusting and keeping people asleep by hit and run means anything they do gets slower and slower. The pallets and faster teleports are nice but snares on their own are strong enough.
---
Were you born in the past 10 years?
---
But some people might like asshole prizes.....
---
Or clown after every hit or pallet stun
---
Prayer beads are dc worthy for sure, hate them. I find iri and infantry belt stupid too.
---
At least you didn’t depip
---
Here's the thing with porting to different platforms is you have to make sure the custom code you've written (which BHVR is actually in the process of converting all their code from UE's Blueprint to C# because it's faster) is compatible with the operating system you want to port to. It's why they most likely have technically separate games for console and PC.
---
Not really, since you are patrolling gens to prevent survivors from leaving the trial.  
---
What if you just stand there waiting for something that may not happen? Besides the fact that it's only usable once per survivor (or per match if SWF)?  
---
I don't know you but I personally never go back to a generator after a chase, and if I do it's only to stop the regression.
---
IRL
---
I was being sarcastic everyone has incentive to cleanse totems.
---
Medkits take an item slot. You can use that slot for toolkits and rush gens now. Yeah, if you're a SWF with medkits and Botany you don't need it, but you also would't need Self-Care then.
---
The doctor has a more “clown-like” laugh honestly.
---
or a [bloater](https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/The_Infected?file=Bloater.jpg), could be fun
---
I mean you could ignore them all gsme so they have dull gameplay to show?
---
No mate, insta-heal toolboxes, that's the real deal.
---
*laughs in spirit
---
I'm not saying they are, and I'm not saying that the xenomorph isn't an effective and ruthless killer. In fact this is an EXCELLENT thing you've got written.
---
I'm just saying that I want to rip out a survivor's spinal column while I purr and stare proudly at the new trophy...
---
Oh I will.
---
This is really good, I would totally support this. Sounds balanced
---
We may not be getting a server at all. Could be connecting to even more Japanese killers on their servers when dedicated servers roll out. Yay
---
Yeah, her hair is the most fluffy and giant thing in the game.
---
At this point I feel like you point the ttv in just so you have people targeting you .
---
and huntress
---
That face camp was pretty sad, impressed you got him out of there!
---
[deleted]
---
I’m saying I’m a rank 10 and I’m beating rank 4’s, also don’t get mad for getting singled out, I mostly prox camp and bait people into saving so I can down them instantly, also shows what u know, I get messages from high ranks too complaining
---
Not far enough to matter on most maps without addons.
---
Legion's pathetic now, but 170 with both vision and turning (plus pallet vaulting and Deep Wound) would just be an objectively better Spirit, let alone 200, where he'd become a full addon Billy just to start.
---
Seems interesting, but every time a killer is hiding as survivor, I'm sad about legion, because so many were thinking it will be his power
---
It was supposed to be Sept 5 through Sept 9, but since the PTB was pushed back, bloodhunt probably will be too
---
99.9999% of the time yes but that time percent that works it's totally worth the rest
---
Not confirmed by BHVR.
---
Been playing Wraith recently because I have the best perks on him atm and mostly get 3-4 kills every game but had a swf all have flashlights and just absolutely destroy me with those things.
---
I don’t get it :( My brain hurts.
---
Asking the real questions
---
They did teabag, you is blind.
---
Computer
---
It's not about NEEDING a mori, though. It's about sending a message.
---
COME HERE MEGAN ! GIMME UR SWEET FINGE-
---
*pallet drops*
---
AHAHA-AAHAHAHA-AHAHA
---
They teabag and flashlight spam multiple times, but him shaking when he swats them down is hypocritical and him being a dickhead?
---
  
---
Aight dude.
---
Yeah i think it is, but I never miss a chance to sarcastically REE
---
They teabagged cuz they knew they were fucked because of Bloodwarden it obviously wasn’t malicious
---
"reverb" 🤢🤢🤢
---
that was probably what he said when i cleansed it
---
That's me every time I hear the damn phasing sound or see that blue berry bitch chasing someone else.
---
no attack cooldown when you throw a hatchet
---
At low ranks you can certainly try walking, but any high tier Spirit worth their salt is going to be hunting by sound. Iron Will can counter that, but not if they're running Stridor (and you'll know if they are, because your breathing will sound louder than it should be for Iron Will).
---
As for where to walk to, your choices are to double back in such a way that you're not likely to collide with her, or to walk to the next available loop rather than contesting the one you're currently at.
---
Oh, right, third-person means you can look over walls. The hill is useless.
---
I lost IQ points reading this. I hope you a have a reimbursement plan.
---
I think it's because throwing a hatchet and getting the hit let's you recover quicker than using the melee attack so you can get back into the chase faster
---
It usually goes faster for me when it's later in the night since that's when SWF comes in, otherwise it's pretty slow in the day
---
cyborg survivor when
---
If it was an option I'd just move him grab a hatchet and leave
---
Yeah they teabagged because they knew they were fucked
---
Also lol do you believe post nerf DS is still too strong? Because then of course it’s relevant
---
It has become a joke IMO. Instead of trick or treat it's trunk or treat or else parents just buy their kids candy. All I want to do is decorate outside put on a costume to blend in with the decorations and scare the shit out of some kids. In the last 10-12 years we've gone from 200 little bags of candy not being enough to 1 bag being excessive.
---
The Entity was nice!
---
Better than 90% of art on this subreddit. Good job :)
---
There should be a more common death hook Mori. Nobody would complain about that, provided moris don't automatically depip players.
---
...and they do, right? For some reason? I recall that being a thing.
---
I mean it's just a copypasta no need to be mad
---
her hitboxes are fine. it's the consistent latency issue in this game that makes it rough
---
At my one job we've already got Christmas stock out, had it since the end of July. It's kind of a joke right now.
---
That's fair, gl in your games my dude. May the ruin last long and the DS's be missed
---
Well I mean the switch is getting a new trapper set so does that count as more console cosmetics? The way those PC cosmetics work are either from codes or purchases of other games on steam besides that PC and console cosmetics aren't different in the slightest
---
I'd say pipping actually does hurt the killer but ok
---
Thank god you’re not insane though. And yeah it was up less than a minute when I clicked.
---
The hell kind of logic is that?  
---
"Lol I'm dead guess I'll do a universally-toxic gesture haha hope he doesn't think I'm toxic"  
---
And yes, DS is up there with Adrenaline for very very fucking strong.
---
I fucking love these Bloodwarden clips
---
I love that every "recognizing how pathetic Killers are" meme is Freddy.
---
Console, its all much brighter
---
Wait what NOOO
---
And then he proceeds to go on to the DbD Forums to complain about how OP survivors are.
---
I still have no idea why they haven’t released Deathgarden on console. It would probably do well. Not as good as DbD, but well enough
---
The visible frustration at the end though. lol
---
I just watched that 3 times in a row. Now I want to get bloodwarden lol.
---
pyramid head would be so cooool
---
Yeah we have Christmas stock coming in this week also. And yet all the customers want is lawn mowers and weed killer that we no longer have 😑
---
In dbd it means escaping the hook yourself (which has a 4% chance).
---
It comes from a basketball player called KOBE, who would do something spectacular in the heat of the moment.
---
It was not their intention to be bugged out, nor were they able to do anything about it because it wouldn't stop. Also, how else would one try and escape the killer? Hide in a bush right after being chased and hope he doesn't find you? A typical player would need to run to escape, it's not an exploit (if used in the proper manner of being a survivor) it's just a general bug that the devs need to fix. Plus, Killers don't deserve anything, if we talking fair here.
---
Sometimes they have add-ons that make benefits from using hatchets
---
Happened to me just yesterday, its rare.
---
1.) Wraith literally counters Borrowed Time, it doesn’t activate while Wraith is cloaked
---
2.) Flashlights are not hard to verse. Face a wall, tree, bait the pickup. When blinded at windows/pallets rely on sound for the few seconds you can’t see. And you have the advantage you can literally see items before the trial. If flashlights are so bad then bring Lightborn or Franklins
---
Agreed!
---
True but you can use it to buy a shiny new game 😁
---
*Disconnects like any normal Nea Main*
---
“Free heals” it can only happen up to 5 times, and with most people running it when the chapter comes out, you’ll be lucky to get two uses out of it. Also, DS isn’t the “most meta” perk. Yes, it is one of the best perks, and probably tied for 1st or 2nd, but it’s not the best perk. It will also only work with Inner Strength in very specific scenarios.
---
Nice. You did everything right there. And it’s Even more enjoyable you both got out since he intentionally hit her after hooking her. I hate that shit.
---
Friend: you're lying, you can't hear images
---
Me: exhibit a
---
I guess it would count more towards console cosmetics.. but what Im just going on a limb here saying that I just like the L4D cosmetics like this one [shirt link](https://steamcommunity.com/games/381210/announcements/detail/661306283824351015)
---
What's the name of the series?
---
Oh I'm insane. Just not in anyway is it related to DBD lol
---
Please meet me when I'm playing Bubba
---
Like really please
---
I thought it was someone dribbling a basketball.
---
You like when she throws above a gen you are working on and she hits you? That’s consistent and it’s physically impossible unless the shot was arched to the moon. That one case highlights a slew of problems. I would contest that fixing hitboxes would make her a weak killer.
---
The boys
---
&gt; but say nothing about streamers that legit face camp with bubba every game.
---
who does this other than Pug? And Pug gets shit here all the time
---
Fax 😔
---
g e t t i n g     v i s i b l e
---
I’d teabag too if I was fucked. He was injured and exit gates were closed for atleast 40 seconds. It’s my way of saying “gg you fucked me.” But that’s why you 99% exit gates and you leave if they’re open while someone is getting hooked. These guys fucked up
---
And tip to counter DS: Just slug. To counter Adrenaline: Run NOED :D
---
I'll disrespect DbD. Their Killers are all the same with an M2 skill slapped on (although they've added some crouching options and mechanics over time) and a variable walk speed. That's good for a few one-trick slashers, but a man like Freddy has OPTIONS.
---
A Freddy game could be suspenseful, too, because a defining feature should be NOT knowing if you're asleep at any given time. Playing Stealth should be totally valid for Freddy, and what skills and map pieces are available could change based on opponents, as he plays on their fears.
---
It would also be able to justify DbD's focus on drawing out kills, since Freddy wants a balance of Fear and Souls for power.
---
How big is the range of the breathe sound of survivors? Sometimes I hear someone behind a wall, sometimes they are damn quiet, sometimes I hear them in the locker, sometimes not.
---
I mean without perks or being injured
---
1.) If I'm not cloaked because I'm chasing a survivor while they go to unhook your point is invalid 
---
2.) it's more of a problem when they are coordinated for flash light saves and flash lights literally counter is entire power. Even if you dodge the blind it still slows you down
---
let me guess: a toxic killer is one that smacks a survivor before 4 gens are done?
---
Thank god, im so tired of mAtChMaKiNg BaD posts all the time
---
I feel like that was youtuber I've seen before
---
Hang in there Kate! Hope the team can escape for your sacrifice.
---
No shock, big cock Doc
---
Survivor 2-5 minutes, repeat process if killer dodges. Killer 5 seconds to 1 minute most of the time
---
A few could share, or don't have that much going on solo. Michael and Jason are extremely similar, for example, being giant implacable supernatural mute men with variable weapons and the occasional trap, but no inhuman POWERS besides uncanny stealth and apparent teleportation.
---
my sense of humor is so fucking gone cause i laughed
---
All these memes about (baby) Dwights are slowly turning me into a Dwight main.
---
&gt; You like when she throws above a gen you are working on and she hits you?
---
oh so you're mad that people can aim. Got it.
---
But you did remind me that survivor hitboxes extend upwards while healing. That should be fixed for sure. That's the one hitbox related issue she has
---
&gt; I would contest that fixing hitboxes would make her a weak killer.
---
I dunno how long you've been playing, but they did change the hitboxes for hatchets sometime last year and she legit became garbage.
---
Super Freddy
---
Rank 9 isn’t good survivors. Anyone who has played even some killer can easily 4K at that rank. You’re not hot shit buddy.
---
I play on console too
---
I'd guess like 8m but echos actually make people louder. Survivors hiding in lockers are really quit.
---
Ah ha ha
---
Ding ding ding
---
That's kinda the idea though, since you own the killer you don't need to burn an offering to demo them to see if you want to play them. At least that way you can burn through them without being at a disadvantage, imagine if it didn't give you any perks like before you bought the dlc, then there would be absolutely no reason to use them if you owned it
---
This is about me
---
Jake's the only one I still had a "Hallows eve lunch box" on 😅 I do play as him quite often though!
---
Love the new spine chill buff.
---
Well played!
---
who mains quentin
---
Hes being sarcastic
---
Ive never seen it not work, so if its consistantly not working for you, then the most likely possibility is you are doing something wrong, or the killer is stealthed.
---
**KIRBY DON’T**
---
Knew*
---
I’ve brought this up before and people pointed out that it could be abused pretty easily. Like a killer is just a good player and so everyone avoids them. Apparently it happened to some Overwatch streamer that everyone avoided him because of his skill.
---
And finally, the Mori.
---
The camera angle shifts to show the Predator standing over the downed survivor, it grabs them by the scruff of the neck and lifts them up.
---
Predator's arm blades extend from its free hand and it drives them into the survivors lower back, carving up and through them until their body falls limp to the ground. A skull and spine all that remains in the Predator's hand.
---
The Predator looks at his new trophy proudly, then hangs it on it's belt and continues the hunt...
---
What is the deal with 5 different badham preschools? I never seem to see any big variation
---
If the killers tried to chase Meg in real life, and out of the Entitys realm, this would happen.
---
Which is why people with over 1k hours can be matched with people over 200 hours. At least 500 is still fairly experienced. But new people must not play against experienced folks, unless they are in swf.
---
thank you :)
---
Take off everything else on the maps so that the survivor doesn't have anything else except those bs windows.
---
I like it! Good job
---
that trapper set is fugly as sin
---
Played with a guy called Hex:BabyDwight and he kept asking me for hatch. I wasnt even kilker.
---
What a mess
---
Well, you seem a bit salty at him there, but I'll admit Legion did seem pretty braindead. The issue then is that they need a REWORK, not to be nerfed into the ground, and I never saw Legion being put into the same ranks as Nurse, Spirit, and Billy before. Maybe because Legion was so unfun to play that it wasn't an issue.
---
If only Co-op Killers was on the table. That'd be a perfect role for Legion. Or a Puppet Character, like Identity V's Dream Witch.
---
Very noice
---
I feel like you aren’t telling us something lmao.
---
If you don’t hear the music/heartbeat, that doesn’t count as being inside the Terror Radius. The Killer can be inches away, but if they have no Terror Radius that you can hear, it won’t activate.
---
But you already admitted that ghost face mask is bright
---
God giving survivors a taste of reality is great and it's even more great when you stop them from doing the "the killer has to see me leave" bullshit LUL
---
I think you just want something to blame, instead that you’re getting outplayed
---
1.) You can easily cloak while chasing, go up to the hook and wait for the unhook. Also when you uncloak you get a speed burst so lunge when you do so and you’ll catch them. If you can’t even do that then run MYC and trade for the unhooker
---
2.)Flashlights can’t stun Wraith but only if you stand still. They don’t do much, I say that as a Wraith main. But Franklins and Lightborn is an option if you see multiple flashlights
---
me trying to vault a window
---
killer’s ping: also no
---
There’s actually no point in watching the other nine. If I were you, I’d just skip straight to Halloween 2018. Sure a COUPLE of decent ones between the original and the new one (Halloween 2 from 1981, Halloween H20), but you’re better off just going straight to Halloween 2018. It’ll save you a lot of pain, trust me.
---
I see no problem
---
Does this mean the way to stop the Wraith is to wedge and explosive up his ass and detonate it?
---
Oh right. I can't have a different opinion am I right
---
Put it on a body pillow
---
yeah, if they implemented what they did in Overwatch, where you can only avoid 3 players at a time, and only for 7 days, this could work. But only for other survivors. Not for killer avoiding survivors or survivors avoiding killers. The only reason for doing this is not related to bad team play.
---
Is this actually common though? Or was it just the one streamer?
---
\&gt; implying that his power isn’t already useless
---
We've only seen a single picture of it(atleast from my knowledge) can we really judge it that harshly from that?
---
#WHO DOESN'T YOU UNCULTURED NON TIRED PERSON
---
You bet your sweet ass I let the survivor escape with that tiny ass chance of unhooking. I have 200 hours in this game (iirc, maybe 150-200, I know it may not be a lot) and I never unhooked myself even with stupid amounts of luck.
---
Just wanted to make them proud   
---
But you can't tell ups from downs  
---
It's all alright  
---
We can find company  
---
In hearts that beat all in sync  
---
We're all alright
---
I hope they change it to work on the gate itself.
---
It would give it a solid buff and punish survivors holding the game hostage by 99ing the gates.
---
Isn't DBD a bit dark for a 12 year old? Not that I'm concerned.
---
^^^^
---
That's why I'm asking, it normally works all the time but suddenly it's stopped working as intended which totally sucks.
---
Spirit main here. Played survivor and got 7 Spirits in a row. Im not sorry but now i understand
---
I spend an unhealthy amount of time fantasizing about doing this to survivors. Lol
---
Wraith is very prone to long chases and getting outrunned so try and utilize that to your advantage for example run a common or killer shack infinite or while your teammates getting chased prioritize objectives. Plague is a toughy that I think someone could give better advice on then me.
---
I've had games where there wasn't any in range and they would always wiggle off because the closest hook was too far away and they would run back to the same spot, hooks stay gone permanently if you sacrifice someone on one and if they are bad survivors and all get downed in the same place there's only so many hooks you can use before it becomes too long of a distance to get to
---
how did "the golden era" of dbd differ from now?
---
"Not for killer avoiding survivors"
---
Killers can already avoid survivors though. If they see the same name pop up again for the next match.
---
"The only reason for doing this is not related to bad team play."
---
Why not let people avoid those who've given them a frustrating game though? I've definitely been into back to back games against the same killers before. Heck... it might even work well if we tone it down to 24 hours instead of 7 days.
---
This is the idea Jane. You may not like it, but this is what Peak thiccness looks like.
---
It's either because rank 1s rightfully don't give a fuck or they realize moris ruin your pipping and they are rank 1 after all
---
yeah, i really don't like the color scheme
---
Thanks!  Honestly Ruin is only effective for a minute or two tops now as it gents destroyed quickly so I hope so lol
---
Nsfw.       /s
---
So many cocky bitches in this game lol
---
"Stronger than yesterday!" - Kate Spears
---
yup. What’s your GT and what rank are you? And what’s your most common build?
---
he was very appreciative so it was worth it. nice messages post game
---
This used to be the case for me, but recently its been me as killer getting into the lobby after two minutes and not seeing a survivor in my lobby for 5 minutes, and then everyone connects at once. I'm not exaggerating on that time, its really about 5 minutes.
---
I mean you say pathetic, but if it’s a deterrent to toxic behaviors like tunneling and camping, then I say it’s justified. I’d rather not lose my points personally, but I can understand why someone who was tunneled and face camped the entire match would rather dc and hurt the killer then give them the same reward real killers get through playing well
---
How lazy do you have to be to not even crop the screenshot? Jesus Christ.
---
#DESTROY THE MEG, KIRBY!
---
Too true lol, you should consider running pop goes the weasel if you don't already. Pretty helpful once ruin goes out
---
The issue isn’t that they don’t want to it’s that they don’t have the rights to the actors face apparently.
---
Same. I always play spirit just cause she’s my favorite killer. Maybe that’s why I get all the toxic people when I play spirit lol
---
Can you describe the issues you have a little bit? That way people can give you better answers
---
Oh yeah I kind of got clown with my 9k shards for bamboozle if I want to use it and pop goes the weasel, it seems so useful.
---
Yeah that's why I read it, 900 episodes is just too much for me
---
cool kids :)
---
yeah i thought that but i was like well no bc no one has a completely unique face or something. idk like i think they just didn’t try 😂
---
How would you double back not to collide? The very nature of doubling back means you're following the same route, which if she is following, she will collide with you.
---
You don't make proper distance to walk to the next loop. You can walk and get a little way there, but she will know you're walking, come out of her power, and then just hit you after a couple seconds.
---
A killer where you HAVE to run Iron Will (which she can counter with Stridor) is terrible design.
---
Finally some good fucking food
---
Invite Micheal, he looks sad.
---
Holy shit I'm not alone
---
Honestly, that would fit as Wraith’s mori too.
---
Yeah I play survivor and killer pretty evenly, and I can confirm, you’re not only a cunt, you’re the worst kind of player this game has to offer, and I wish nothing but facecamping Leatherfaces upon you. Take you L and move on instead of DC’ing like a bitch
---
\*SMACK*
---
(Slow clap)
---
I leave out of embarrassment more then anything
---
you always boop the snoot/ let survivors boop the snoot
---
This sub is just incredibly killer favored in general. The prevailing wisdom here is that there's basically nothing killers can do that's toxic short of straight up body blocking the basement.
---
Yeah
---
I always manage to put on lightborn before the game starts so if you have it I reccomend throwing it on. They usually try to blind u at pallets but with lightborn u can just charge through while they stand still and helpless
---
Take my pfp change good sir!!!
---
It's to stop a survivor from holding the killer in the game for another 2 minutes if they wanted to, yeah it annoying that you can't use deliverence or try to get off but also think of the amount of either toxic or vindictive people that when they got hooked the last time they would just sit on hook and waste the killers time without anything the killer can do to stop them. Plus most people would just face camp the last hook if you could try to get off so more often than not you'd get downed again immediately and that would give even more reason to run DS so they can't hook you again after the first time
---
Allegedly that's how he got his weapon, after all.
---
Next chapter: Nightmare in Entityland
---
Whenever I'm against Plague I feel very helpless, and I never know how to win the chase. Against Wraith, I feel like he always catches me very quickly
---
Maybe dont advertise your stream with 1 viewer with your steam name. 90% the time those guys are toxic as fuck anyway, always have some shit to say in post chat, i should see if i still have the clip but im pretty sure i had a ttv guy tell me to kms because i would down people with reverse bear traps on their head, said i was playing wrong.
---
Are you justifying disconnecting because you were captured by the Killer?
---
I don't doubt people would still complain but I see your point.
---
And then survivors cry about NOED.
---
Also yes DS is too dtronh in the late game. If you save it and you are untouchable. You can just crawl to the exit or run Unbreakable.
---
You obviously either play very little killer or you don't plax killer in red ranks. 
---
If you are any Killer besides Nurse or Spirit the chances are stacked against you in yiu run into a swf all running Adrenaline, DS etc.
---
i literallt had a nea miss three skill checks at the end of the gen. meaning right as the gen was about to finish she missed. three times. literally let me finish it omg
---
please, bhvr  (╥﹏╥)
---
More time for killing and a nice quitter bonus too.
---
Fuckin diabolical
---
I think the survivor should have a chance to get off but there should be not struggle faze so they can atleast try to escape
---
Mix it with thanatophobia and sloppy butcher for maximum slowness
---
I FEEL THIS SO HARD! We had a few customers get pissy that we've got no more garden stock coming in, and having to explain it time and time again is getting actually painful to do.
---
If I could save time in a bottle
---
Same...
---
Oh it definitely is kind of useless unless you run some speed boost or catch people around gens that had some cover on approach.  Definitely not the best killer lol
---
Ahhhhhhh makes sense
---
Bad copy is still bad
---
No, if you read my comment I say that toxic behavior such as tunneling or camping gets equal payback with disconnecting. I wouldn’t do it because I’m greedy and want my points, but there have been times I’ve been tempted to do it because the frustration from losing a game to a hardcore tunneled is hella intense.
---
Michael on the background is a nice detail.
---
Konami has shit all over the franchise so hard, I wouldn’t trust them to give DbD a decent character to license
---
I think I’ve used it a few times just didn’t have it when everyone actually knew how to and me out of stealth
---
Honestly you're just getting annoying at this point and I'm running out of time to respond, however: 
---
1.) Most areas like jungle gyms I don't want to cloak because I wouldn't be able to capitalize when they make a mistake. I do run MYC, the situation I'm specifically writing about was in endgame collapse while I'm trying to juggle 3 of them, most situations don't allow for everything to work out exactly how you want it to. 
---
2.) This is only sort of true. If a survivor runs Object with a flashlight they can make your life very hard compared to other killers. I say this as a former wraith main. It's not that I'm just complaining, this game makes it too easy to bully killers. And if you're playing literally the worst killer in the game I feel like you have at least a little bit leeway to complain lmao 
---
If you wanna clap back with an actual educated response I can respond later but life calls to me right now
---
From the discussion we had I think people said it was fairly often. And if survivors could avoid killers or vice versa it could really make a bad matchmaking situation worse.
---
One fucked up wheel out of four.
---
Myers is my last brain cell watching my 2nd and 3rd last brain cells make me mind game my self
---
It gets demonstrably more difficult cuz idk maybe survivors get better and the playing field get a little more even. You clearly proved my point, you’re mid rank killer who camps so he don’t pip up. Shouldn’t be hard and if you used some sort of intellectual power, you would realize that’s what I’m arguing at this
---
Point. Now you can stop commenting with a clear trash opinion
---
Imagine thinking GF is op. I’d hate to see his reaction when he’s matched against a halfway decent nurse
---
It really is, it's one of those perks that people know is good but is still kind of underrated lol
---
Same just that face camping billy makes me want to be rank 20 again
---
I got it for lockers. It was on The Game, and it actually looked a little better than the default lockers.
---
Look how pissed my main David is, he's pissed he's not holding it right.
---
Thanks dad
---
The interior is coloured
---
Can’t the killer open the gates now if they’re powered though?
---
Thanks.
---
And if the Quentin had DC'd to prevent the hook both would have escaped for free. At this point DCing needs to be punished severely since if they were SWF that's what would have happened. Same thing for giving people hatch. Exploiting this is a serious problem.
---
Trapper is the most bullied killer, f for my old main
---
wow ur the teammate i dream of having on my team
---
Well then it looks like survivors cry about shit.....just like killers cry about shit. Just get over it and adapt lol it’s a video game buddy
---
And stick to the DnD reddit bud. Suits you better
---
Another thought I mentioned was to tone it down to 24 hours rather than 7 days. Surely it wouldn’t be so bad then.
---
Happy cake day!
---
As a survivor I like going against bw. Keeps the end game fun.
---
They're no skill survivors who don't like you pointing out one of the many broke mechanics that go in their favor
---
Why would you want to disconect if you are being camped?
---
when camped you either kill yourself on the hook if you want to ned the game fast and keep at least your few points, or stay there making the killer lose time.
---
Unless your other teammates are stupid and don't do gens.
---
Whenever there is am exit gate open, if a survivor gets hooked then both exit gates are blocked for 60 seconds
---
Disconnecting is not pay back to the Killer it's a pussy Survivor who can't take losing. Tunneling is a strategy it may be cheap but it is damn sure effective. Disconnecting is not a strategy is just a spiteful person who can't take it he wasn't good enough to get away
---
Working on generators and healing make your hitbox bigger. Even though you're ducking to perform the action, your hitbox is a bit bigger than if you were standing normally.
---
Okay either an easy or intermediate killer. Billy is good for learning abilities, wraith to learn mind games. Other than that there's nothing you can do but learn as you play.
---
Monto is good to watch for hints and maybe hybridpanda. There are others but these guys are the least toxic. Otofu streams and is also worth a watch.
---
[I first found it here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/TooWeakTooWeak/comments/cmz99v/hinjaku_hinjaku/)
---
Y'all seriously just need to fucking get laid already...tired of this bs. The mods should've banned shit like this too.
---
Too OP
---
Why a gen only takes 80 sec solo ill never know. Why can survivors use "killer shack" as one of the strongest looping places in the game, Ill never know. Why is holding W around a wall the best time waster in the game, Ill never know.
---
Looping should not be the most powerful escape tool for survivors in the game. /S
---
She sucks if you don't know how to play against her, i'm not a pro surv but she's more fun than letherface and billy lol
---
I'ts weird but most quentins I see are nice people.
---
Lose on purpose to de-pip, or I think quitting will de pip you. If you're struggling it's probably the best move so you can actually enjoy the game. There are a lot of sweats in the lower ranks that will drive you crazy
---
I still would prefer a change. 
---
What if you down someone and the next exit gate is to far away?
---
With the way I suggested Bloodwarden would actually be useful and force survivors to pressure themselfes.
---
i dont find it super fair. it makes it too easy to patrol doors
---
"you're not supposed to be here"  
---
"Neither are you"
---
No difference between rank 9 and 1 except more SWF groups.
---
Watch any youtuber at high ranks and watch the potatoes.
---
For me it’s not that it’s not face camping
---
It’s more just that after a bad killer game (especially if i’m just getting a daily done with a killer I suck at), i’m gonna secure a single sacrifice if I can, even if I have to stoop a bit low.
---
Gotta get some bp somehow
---
That's not a thing that happens. You have some exposure somewhere that you're not aware of. Believe me, I play mostly killer and survivors are constantly sticking out while they think they're covered.
---
I'm also going to point this out:
---
&gt; how does she throw through a gen?
---
initially you were complaining about:
---
&gt; when she throws above a gen you are working on and she hits you?
---
These are totally different statement. So it looks like you're just fishing for stuff to complain about
---
Wah wah wah the killer did his job so I abused the lack of punishment for disconnects to rob the killer of the points he earned. You’re a shit player, and you’re almost exclusively the reason they’re adding temp bans for DC’s
---
How many gens were done?
---
If someone is hooked after gates are open no one can leave for x amount of seconds. I think 90 is the cap? I haven't checked in a while
---
I've been hanging around Killer Rank 16 because I like the more chill pace and the survivors are -generally- not toxic enough to warrant my tryhard pants, so I'll be giving them a good scare and letting them run when I can. It can be tough though, like when you go for hooking everyone once and then they never touch the hooked person... feels bad man.
---
I'm not saying Spirit is easy, I mean Spirit is easy, but still more difficult than most killers in this game. Sorry, but what's so skillful about Wraith? I don't mean he's easy to win, he is easy to play.
---
And sorry, but looping random debris or pickup with a safe pallet on Autohaven isn't hard at all.
---
Flashlight clicking and teabagging dont end the game to the killers
---
No. One that hits people on hook, face camps, and tunnels.
---
3 I think
---
they mean how it hits you over the gen when it clearly went above you. not trying to agree with anyone but that definitely happens.
---
He is pretty fun, I would recommend him
---
Now that sounds just awful
---
K
---
lmfaooo
---
Kirby forgot to bring a mori :(
---
Showing even low teirs can still win T.T
---
Ok I was gonna make a meme about the NOED but carry on nicely done!
---
13. Every month is reset day there you can face all the good survivors. In the beginning of the month you should get matched with survivors equal to your skill... Do you have all killers? You need to level all killers for the perks. You can start with leatherface but don't become a basement Bubba face camper with insidious XD. You have a insta down with your chainsaw and the perk BBQ and chilli is good for beginners.
---
Is this a joke?
---
i love that. glad you can see how frustrating / annoying she can be
---
Thank you kind sir
---
The community is pretty toxic but I hope we don’t scare off the newer players :(... I play League, CSGO, and R6S which also has a toxic community but still has a lot of people playing. Hope the same would happen for Dead by Daylight.
---
How did you get to 9 without being able to do chases? Because Wraith and Plague you just loopity loop. Plague you do it in injured state, Wraith you have be observant, look across fields to catch his movements or not let him sneak up on you.  
---
I have no problem with any killer, Im low rank they just kill me all the same but i do get some good chases every now and then
---
13. Every month*
---
I'm sorry...but the bloodpoint grind was so bad Kirby became a Killer
---
#F
---
Well, this is just true of all killers, a far as unpredictability and play styles go. Like, some Wraiths body block while others try and mindgame the red stain as they uncloak for their base kit speed boost to shut down loops
---
Oh please, those are such loose terms. hitting people on hooks doesn’t affect anyone but the killer by slowing them down, I’ve been called a camper because someone unhooked someone else 3 seconds after I hooked them and I walked back, and I’ve been called a tunneler because they gave me a hug and then complain when I don’t let them use their obvious Decisive
---
Imagine wanting a killer removed because you can’t manage to figure out how to play against her
---
SpIrIt Is AlL aBoUt MiNdGaMeS, gIt GuD
---
13th every month*
---
the thing is with nurse it's more interactive and she gives you information to react to.
---
with spirit you either get away or die depending on how good or bad she is.
---
Just remember he's a pedophile and it makes it much easier!
---
This is just you guys being unaware of how much your character model is showing. If you shave over the gen you'll hit the survivor even if they're crouching.
---
Inmagine freddy being able to tuen into a survivor and he could be pretending to work on gen and mess up every skill check
---
Honestly, that's how it usually goes for your first 50 hours or so. This game is a grind. 
---
If I were you I would buy Leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chili (Not required, but it's a great perk and makes the grind way less tedious.). Just keep at it, dumping bloodpoints into whichever killer you want to level for teachables next. 
---
If you lose a match don't sweat it, you cant win 'em all. You'll be perked out and ready to go before you know it. 
---
Happy hunting, friend.
---
If they knew about bw they wouldn't run into the gates. You can still win
---
What if you wanted a chill game, but survivor said gen rush
---
I am not saying she's hard, but she's still more difficult than most killers in this game.
---
The most difficult killers are probably Nurse, Huntress and Doctor(Doctor is difficult but still sucks even if you're good at him). Other killers are just easy, but Spirit is definitely harder to play as than Wraith, Clown or Legion. Hillbilly and Hag may be more difficult or on similar level as Spirit, maybe Trapper too(but same as Doctor).
---
Now don't get me wrong I've been tunnel and farmed myself and it does piss you off. But what is the point of being so emotionally hurt that you want to damage the other person's rank because you lost? I think this Society needs to sit back and take a break from these games until they realize it's just a game. Too many people in this community invest their whole life into this game and when they get killed or captured they feel like it's an insult to them.
---
Lmao bro
---
Why don’t any of the huntress cosmetics change her thrown hatchets? As a huntress main, I would really enjoy having my sniper throws have a bit of flair to them whenever I dress up the momma
---
Amazing job!
---
Trying to get MoM with no mither would be the ultimate challenge
---
it should be illegal for you to have an opinion.
---
This guy's is getting downvoted because waaaahhhh spirit no counter play waaaahhh cannot pallet stun
---
Ok so I was doing Adept Jeff achievement, my first attempt. It's Billy, he tunnels the shit of the first survivor, me does my genrush. The second survivor randomly disconnects.
---
Here we are together with Nea against Billy and his 3gen. He finds me, he runs me for minute, he hooks me, Nea finishes the gen and opens the gate.
---
Oh and it was my first hook. Guess who did his 4%, broke the hook and escaped through the hatch? Too bad I wasn't recording.
---
Why do I lose a pip when the game disconnects everybody at the same time? 
---
Don’t tell me that’s not true bc I recorded it lol.
---
Lmao. "Abusing" you mean like abusing tbe fact they haven't and wont punish hook camping or tunneling?
---
Get the fuck out of here. I love how I'm a shit player because I refuse to deal with shit that should be punishable. But yet they ARE punishing survivor behavior. Fucking prove my point that killers are babies who get what they want in this game. Peace.
---
uhh what? have you ever played survivor lmao. leatherface is the easiest killer to loop in the game, hence he's really fun to vs overall.
---
billy is also loopable, regardless of his map pressure.
---
its not about "knowing how to play against her". I've been playing dbd since the beta, i know this is bullshit. if she's good enough... you're not getting away.
---
if you lose her it's because she made a mistake.
---
yeah just don't get hit dude stop complaining 4head
---
Now listen me, speed addon + PWF
---
I’m the kind of wraith that abuses the *Soot: Ghost* add-on when I play him in pubs. It’s kind of a requirement if you want to prevent the long ass chases with the speed boost and no terror radius.
---
One of the most entertaining things as a huntress is exactly this, having no idea a survivor is in a locker when you go to reload, like, hey i was going for hatchets, but i'll take you too!
---
What’s it about?
---
Tomorrow the ptb starts but the stranger things content starts on Wednesday, tomorrow is testing dedicated servers
---
👌
---
Literally had a match with 3 Neas and a Claud and every Nea decided to dc as soon as I hooked, felt bad for the Claudette, can't lie. My Phillip isn't heartless when it comes to the last survivor, apparently.
---
what if you wanted an unbiased discussion, but baby killers claimed doing an objective was gen rushing because they don't know how to pressure
---
It stops the scream. A few patches ago they increased how long survivors scream for when hooked for some reason.
---
that makes hag annoying and that's why i stopped using her boi
---
Superheroes gone bad. Much gore, but very good!
---
MY NAME IS BARRY ALLEN AND I'M THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE, WHEN I WAS 12 MY MOTHER WAS KILLED A YELLOW GUY, NOT AN ASIAN BUT A GUY WHO WAS DRESSED IN YELLOW CLOTHES.﻿
---
Even with your suggested change there is no incentive for the survivors to open the gate rather than 99% it. Maybe if blood warden would work longer on unopened gates than open ones but I doubt they would ever buff BW that much
---
i always thought no mither and unbreakable would be funny
---
I think that attitude is a great one, but at the same time there are also killers that get so butthurt about not being able to instantly down a survivor in a chase they tunneled them for the entire match and then facecamp them if they get them. That kind of treatment can damage a survivors rank because the killer is so emotionally hurt about the survivor not throwing themselves on the hook. This argument is basically two sides of the same coin, and thusly I don’t feel bad when toxic behavior gets paid back to the person
---
Tunneling is part of the game. Dcing is just being a cunt.
---
We both know it’s not true
---
How is he a pedophile?
---
So the DC wasn't toxic either ? Sure.
---
Amazon prime original
---
Well done! 🥇
---
My response was obviously to your claim that im5a blendette and need to go out doing stuff. That's why y claim is that you're obviously a wannabee toxic looper who gets 2-tapped simple.
---
You didn't disprove hitting on hooks being toxic.
---
Camping is "I'm gonna hook you and then stay within 10 meters to make sure I can down you again and rebook you"
---
Tunneling is either realistically or not being able to go after the unhooker, and going after the person who was unhooked exclusively, until they die.
---
And you used one of the classic bs baits. There is completely a difference between Rank 1 and 9. After watching TrueTalent, he can fairly reliably call what people rank color people are.
---
Running optimal routes, using and abusing infinite loops, not pointlessly using pallets, there is a huge difference.
---
as far as annoying things in the game go, that's one of the least annoying
---
I check to see if it’s an attractive man
---
highly Doubt that lol
---
She can simply ignore loops, she's unprendictable. But with some game sense and brain you can win chases
---
but if it is annoying it should at least havea counter, like calm spirit allowing you to not lock your camera on it
---
so when i die im not having fun even tho ive pipped? dammit, my life is ruined
---
I would 100% prefer going against a spirit and losing than winning by looping for 10 minutes a bubba lol
---
why should something annoying have a counter? annoyingness has nothing to do with game balance
---
***boom***
---
Ahh nice! Don’t have Prime though so I won’t be able to see it
---
I SAW only one room like that haha... the game...I hate when that happens.
---
* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam. 
---
I didn’t say it was an effective strategy, or any kind of strategy at all. All I said is if you play toxic it’s gonna get thrown back in your face. And if you don’t want them to disconnect on you don’t get toxic and play cheap, plain and simple
---
Congrats your prize is a slap on the wrist and a swf with insta heals seriously I wish they had a reward for hitting rank 1
---
I have a lot of those swf with insta heals, I don't need more thanks XD
---
SUNLIGHT YELLOW OVERDRIVE!
---
Entity: *Laughs in denial*
---
I think I saw a video where a guy used spine chill to predict where she was, he put down fake scratch marks and then exited the house where he left scratch marks. I do remember getting slaughtered by Spirit when I went against her but it's been a while too...
---
Hex: No One Escapes death, it activates on a random dull totem when the gates are powered. When the perk is active, killers' melee attacks can (aside from The Legion's power) automatically down healthy survivors, and the killer moves a smidge faster. Survivors are only outright told that the perk is currently active when a survivor is hit with an eligible melee attack.
---
Since it makes the killer a lot more dangerous in the endgame, most survivors will prioritise escaping when informed that it is active if they would otherwise intend on first searching chests/unhooking teammates/taunting the killer/etc.
---
Understandable have a great day lol
---
Run over the other survivors with my 2001 Honda Civic, I must.
---
but when you are looping it grants a free hit for no reason, why would the character look at it when you have the hag behind you?? the solution can also be that your camera doesn't look at it when in a chase, but outside it yes
---
I saw that video too, scratch juking is really effective, or simply play like claudettes, always in tall grass lol
---
A man of culture, I see you are
---
More like there's literally no counterplay besides iron will if they have a headset.
---
Appreciate it thanks!
---
As a side note, I already said I play survivor and killer evenly, so take that “crybaby killer” shit else where. I’m not disagreeing with you because I play killer, I’m disagreeing with you because you’re a bitch
---
Yep, you completely missed it, unsurprisingly.
---
Ooohhh wow rank 1 survivor, aren't you great, there are sooo few of you. Do you always flex the rank? I'm rank 1 killer and survivor, btw, since we're comparing sizes and all. But sure, being rank 1 means by default that you can loop, that's how it works.
---
Look how mad I am :( Get in the bin trash puppy.
---
she relies on that. her ability is largely to counter looping which is why she has a lower base speed than most killers
---
&gt; the solution can also be that your camera doesn't look at it when in a chase, but outside it yes
---
"the solution is making this facet of the character utterly useless"
---
come on dude. don't be unreasonable
---
What most players do is start with the killers/survivors that have the most usefull perks as teachables (ex: Claudette for self-care or hag for ruin) then after getting them you can either level up those completely or change to other killers/survivors to get more perks and options.
---
This prosess however takes a lot of grinding and effort, my recomendation is focusing on playing killer to get a lot of bloodpoints and with them either level up survivors or killers. Just have patience and the good stuff will start coming at levels 20-50
---
good luck
---
Is just head back and search the totem
---
Join us
---
Imagine a survivor entering a locker at the beginning of the map and see a different set of hatchets than normal, the survivor would imediately know that a huntress is the killer
---
Were they all short chases and 1 hooked? Because that would do it.
---
Please, rush an already burned out industry into the ground
---
What edit?
---
flair checks out
---
&gt; Please read the stickied Mod post.
---
Inner Strength is a perk slot. The only form of healing that doesn't take up any kind of slot is base healing from another survivor.
---
Like I said, how are all these forms of healing OK, but Inner Strength will somehow be OP? It takes a total of 22 seconds (14 cleansing a totem and 8 sitting in a locker) to use, which is faster than a standard self heal but with technically 2 requirements to use, but still slower than a standard heal from someone else.
---
It isn't the fastest heal, it isn't the slowest heal, but it is effective enough in it's own right for certain circumstances, it being effective shouldn't make it a problem.
---
It may have been your ping
---
Let’s say the killer has Haunted Ground and NOED. The game gets to the end and someone cleanses one of the two, triggering haunted grounds. Would the other totem stay lit and turn to noed or would noed never activate?
---
" equal to pallet looping and body blocking"
---
So the ONLY thing survivors have is equal to shitty practices that killers can and should avoid... I just cant process that level of stupidity. This comment alone shows how babified killers are.
---
Hurr durr i made a thanos reference.
---
I don't tbag or flashlight click. Idk why you think I'm toxic. I'm not.
---
The BP loss of camping is so negligible it's not even worth mentioning.
---
And fuck it, I'll still DC and play a game that doesn't promote toxic bullshit. As a matter of fact Borderlands comes out that same weekend. So oh well. Also new servers means no bullshit window and 360 hits. No hits through pallets. Cant wait to see the bitching that comes with that from all you babies.
---
Happened to me, gone forever RIP
---
Ping?
---
Guess it was PainReliever, love his videos. he should be way bigger imo.
---
I don’t need to even finish reading your comment to see you’re beyond reasoning lol
---
Why does it even matter if you’re on someone’s stream though, 99% of the time if you’re against a streamer they most likely have 2-5 viewers that are all their own friends.
---
It would be like my friends sitting on the couch with me watching me play.
---
People don’t like TTV because its shameless, not because they’re a streamer.
---
&gt; We haven't announced the dates for any blood hunts yet, only that there will be on soon™.

Comment by Peanits, a Community Manager, in the official forum. [Source](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/660074#Comment_660074)
---
Mmmmmm yes this smells like an entitled person
---
I know the devs are working on it, I'm pretty excited for it! I'm pretty sure people don't try to hurry devs through Kirby memes, but it seems like the joke went over you like a Rank 20 Huntress's hatchet
---
So high quality
---
Don’t forget ghost face can stalk people as much as he wants but Myers has a cap on how much he can stalk, making ghost face possibly a better option in longer games.
---
people who don't want to get grabbed in a locker. I'm not gonna see that nasty ass, peeling eyelids ass goblin face
---
No they weren’t I hooked 3 of them twice and one once, also the chases were about 1 minute each. Also the game lasted until all gens were done
---
Because pale rose has a lot of dead zones and gens with nothing around them making chases extremely boring but the map is large at the same time so it’s harder for killers to apply enough pressure to stop the gens, this leads to gameplay being less enjoyable for individual survivors, and at the same time hard for killed
---
This is why I hope the dedicated server tests tomorrow end up going well so they can come sooner and punish these morons.
---
Thank you I'm here all week
---
I love it, by the way
---
I mean idk, I guess they just didnt do it for some reason, maybe since it is a separate part of a cosmetic, so more than three types of cosmetics would be added for her. Although now that I think about it that could apply for many other things, like hillbilly's chainsaw or trappers' traps
---
Aw thank u
---
Is it true that none of the chainsaw movement speed add-ons for bubba work? I’ve seen that tossed around here a couple times but haven’t had the time to test it out myself.
---
Myers can use it with Dead Rabbit to have no terror radius in a chase for whatever reason and you can also run it with Make Your Choice to never technically tunnel anyone, but the perk is kinda....useless.
---
Whys that? Spirit has more counter play. Against Nurse, you're just at the mercy of her own skill.
---
Like I can understand the appeal of it, but his add on is too strong and has no real downside. But ya, I agree. And the few survivor pink add-ons/items are powerful, but very situational
---
Iridescent Pallet
---
I always found fighting spirit easy, if you play with earbuds you can CLEARLY hear when she is near you
---
Yes, that's what I do.
---
You’d be surprised how many killer just open the locker and tank the DS, even though they know you have it. Your situation would work against a smart killer but against dumb ones it wouldn’t at all. Even after the DS most killers will just keep chasing you because they don’t understand map pressure.
---
Does anyone have any solid advice for playing the pig? I'm pretty new, and feel that she's a ton of fun, but I'm open to all and any advice.
---
Okay, congrats I suppose.
---
Not that bad tho, you can still get merciless even with a DC. 
---
Hurts the dumbass who does it more cause they lose everything from the match and -2 pip. 
---
Fuck toxic DC players.
---
Mori’s are unbalanced as shit, that’s coming from a killer main. The only reason why I think someone would use one though is to just have a mad power trip every once in awhile.
---
You could pretend the nurse is from silent hill if you want.
---
Congrats, okay I suppose, yes.
---
I'm rank 12. And when i dont DC i usually double pip. Id guess i should be around rank 6. I'm not bad, I just refuse to reward shitty killers.
---
And yes. The game is designed for killers to win. The overwhelming amount of advantages they get over survivors speaks to that. Im having fun getting all this proof you're all crybaby ass killers who expect to get 4 mans very game. They should reduxe the amount of hook states needed to die to 1. And give you 200k bloodpoints for a sacrifice. Oh and take away windows. Maybe you all wont cry as much then.
---
This is slander
---
*that is not the law of equivalent exchange*
---
Evil hibbert
---
Lmao stick to your insults. Youre still defending them. Killer baby
---
It's not worth reacting to. It's been explained before, they can't make him look like a real person. And they could possibly get in trouble for changing a character already approved by the licensed company.
---
Nah. Im laughing with my friend in party at all of these responses and the fact that I'm getting downvotes, which have no tangible effect on my life.
---
Youre all cry babies who don't want your bullshit thrown back in your face. All the responses, and even the message i got, attest to that.
---
I got veil
---
Love that spastic noding you did. They had it coming. :)
---
omg
---
mmmm then the hag can get free hits and doesn't have a counter except flashlight? c'mon boii
---
As if the humming wasn’t a dead giveaway. Plus other killers already have instant giveaways like Plague, Pig, Trapper.
---
bond by miles
---
So in other words, you CAN'T respond because i disproved your bullshit. Cool.
---
Ahem, may I introduce you to...

“Boo hoo hoo killer too strong” I see someone doesn’t get what an asymmetrical game is supposed to be. I already said 2 kills is what the devs intend, so no, I don’t expect it to rain 4k’s. I do, however, expect the survivors to not DC like little bitches when they’re caught, but I see this concept is a little too advanced for your rank 12 mind to handle. It’s ok little buddy, you’ll get there someday, I believe in you
---
Eh, Jump Rope is a 9% speed penalty. It adds 7.2 seconds to a generator, 2.88 seconds to self care, and 1.44 seconds to healing others. I dislike it with Black Box because the main strength of Jump Rope is to spook them with a "scary red bar", and make them wake up when it isn't an issue. With Black Box and Swing Chains, everyone suffers a permanent penalty, sure, but a 3% penalty. Even if everyone is asleep, that's just a 12% slowdown. Again, the strength is to spook them into waking up. The slowdown add-ons are massively overrated because even with Swing Chains + Jump Rope, it's a 21% penalty only if everyone is asleep. It's kinda hefty but you use both slots for it. So no pallets (if you prefer), no skill check add-ons, no gen tp cool down add-ons, no Class Photo ETC. 
---
It's a nice combo in theory, but in practice it doesn't help all too much.
---
spirot lmak
---
That's fine, I just prefer to know wether or not im being recorded. I can see where you're coming from though.
---
It's obvs a joke, but if I joke about someone's fat ass, they probably *actually* have a fat ass. People don't joke about stuff they don't actually believe in most cases, unless they're mocking someone. Also, the title "I'm sick of waiting" should probably different if you're not actually sick of waiting. If anyone is entitled, it's the hundreds of people making posts about the ptb not being out yesterday or the day before.
---
Joke or not, perpetuating even a facade of impatience to devs that normally do us good isn't a good thing to do as a community in a business where overworking and deadlines are a very real threat. It's all fun and games until people get 20 more hours a week because little Johnny wants their $10 DLC a week sooner.
---
Bottom line, I get that it's a joke, it's fine to joke, but 1) I think this is the wrong thing to joke about given it's pervasive nature and 2) maybe a more positive tone than "sick of waiting" might do better.
---
spirit isn't exactly mindgames though, if she was an actual mindgame it'd be fun. spirit is pure guesswork and hoping she's bad atm.
---
 I'm usually rank 10, 11 survivor vsing some 10's and sometimes 5's lol
---
"Death by snoo snoo!"
---
And i appreciate people that want to have fun. When playing killer i often see the last guy alive stopping during a chase and tbagging, i always let them escape, this game doesn't have to be toxic. And yes, ruin is good until you reach rank 10, after that it is shit. I'm just waiting for pop goes the weasel in the store
---
I just targeted and killed streamer, not because of streaming but because that bitch blinded me while breaking pallet
---
That's a read my friend. If you're thinking "hopefully she does this so I can escape" you just made a read based on the provided information.
---
Lol, Rage Quitting 30s before the game ends... What can of sad little prick do you have to be!
---
Oh, well in that case someone is just a cunt and most likely just wants attention. Even if streamer might have 2 or 5 viewers, the killer might not even check on the streamer's profile
---
The worst is the girl screaming at the cat meme. I have seen it at least 18 times on this sub alone. 
---
'when xxxx does xxxx' haha lets all laugh out loud in the comments guys
---
indeed it is
---
I'll rephrase, no *consistently* red rank killer is getting 360'd
---
You know your right, I think tilting the left stick makes the character move in a certain direction
---
pgtw is bae
---
She has to guess basing of usual surv behavior and scratches, if you play smart you can win. If she is real good you're going to die, like kother killers when they meet swf
---
well that makes sense then.
---
this is odd, i just had a game like this.
---
oh boy it sure is great to waste a perk slot
---
I honestly don’t even understand why ranking exists at all if shit like this happens
---
Wouldn't that just notify the survivors that the killer has it? It's perfect already no need to change it, killers can open doors anyway so that's pointless.
---
I don't want to spend 5€ just to have that perk lol, guess i'm going to wait
---
What do you mean? We can do that to any killer.
---
Do you have a scat fetish? You use the word shitter alot. Or maybe your IQ is too low to come up with a better insult. Either way, have fun steaming while I continue to ignore your pathetic attempts to rile me up.
---
good point, but the issue here is my bad wording.
---
i meant to describe it as "hopefully she makes some stupid error that she really shouldn't"
---
That’s a spicy hacker or laggy survivor, we need teabagging smol boi to punish him.
---
Xbox player. With Borrowed Time. With game sense. Holy shit. Do you think we could SwF together sometime? Doesn’t have to be in a party, I’ll just invite. I’m tired of solo q randoms who have no clue what to do and run wild when they hear the terror radius
---
so do you have the same issue with all killers that get free hits? There's a number of them
---
and again
---
*fucking again*
---
she only has 10 traps so it's not like the map is a literal fucking minefield
---
I know you're new, so please just play the game more and get experience before you go off on shit like this
---
but the puppets hands should be doing the pointing and waving
---
that's just not the case with good spirit players, i wish it was. that wouldn't be too bad, but nothing you can try will actually work on good spirits.
---
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that it may work once in your first chase, but after that it won't.
---
I like my Quentins like I like my cheese, aged and stinky
---
Yes
---
ah thank you, ive been wondering why everyone has been saying its free, havent even checked the dlc store page yet :|
---
I believe this belongs in the salt section, because you got plenty of it.
---
It's no big deal to name drop, they're in the public eye. Angry pug right? I've only watched a few of his streams, but he just got really drunk and insidious camped in basement. It was kinda obnoxious.
---
I'm pretty sure he said he mains him. But tbf I don't really watch his channel.
---
I know. But hey, there are two op killers, one mid tier and the others can be bullied hard. Devs are shit at balancing sadly. Like at matchmaking fixing, or hitboxes.
---
You can’t loop him when he always gets right next to you like there’s no way to outrun him on a loop, I had a good position and he somehow still caught up following the loop
---
this is the most rank 20 post i have ever seen
---
I’m a rank 2 :(
---
Crotus Penn is definitely not killer sided. Father Campbell’s chapel is a killer sided map though.
---
The only reason I'm failing to understand is because you have to think the exact same thing with Nurse. I think if the Nurse is really good, you're only at her mercy. There's only so much you can do before she gets to you. At least pallets and things are still usable against spirit. Throwing down a pallet and trying to mind game it against nurse is literally asking to be hit.
---
Except if she has a good headset, and know how to use her hitbox to check for survivors.
---
I'd think she'd be perfectly balanced if she lost her hitbox while phasing.  Then survivors who are uninjured/using Iron Will could viably dodge her by sneaking through her, vs them getting bodychecked by thin air that turns out to actually be a phasing spirit.
---
you must be the most boosted player in existence then, sorry
---
I just realized that Quentin's current face reminds me of Tommy Jarvis in F13.
---
he is literally one of the most loopable killers in the game
---
Nope I’m good and good enough to prove it so go smd
---
This is giving me flashbacks to:
---
"Hi guys, rank 20 Claudette here with 13 hours in the game. You need to nerf Freddy NOW because he is SO OP! HOW am I supposed to escape from an INVISIBLE killer?"
---
P3 tweaker mains

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cyt12v/best_ghost_face_perks_and_strategies_i_wanna_play/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not on super sonic mode
---
Happened to me earlier today. They all sprinted to the hook and I mopped them up. I feel like if you get a 4k you should a pip at least.
---
Not a fetish, I just call it how I see it, and if showing you the flaws in your reasoning is what you consider “attempts to rile you up”, there’s not much hope for you. I sincerely wish you luck when dedicated servers come out, it’ll be a miracle if you’re not banned within the first day
---
That would actually be a really good thing, but i doubt something will change. Can't wait to main spirit to counter the mass of cancer perks that will come in a few days
---
lmao if you think a Wraith is unbeatable then you are not good
---
Nah, id say its pretty good
---
Bro shut up, his art is pretty good, just get out if your gonna be a jerk
---
I’ve never even hit a kobe and this fool sees this 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
are you being bodyblocked? because if you start hearing him uncloak you have to do something other than running in the same direction you have been, which I know is what you're doing because you are boosted beyond belief
---
As a Huntress main, i never did :-(
---
Were there luck perks/offerings?
---
&gt; Father Campbell’s chapel is a killer sided map though.
---
How is it killer sided? If anything it is one of the most fair maps which leans slightly survivor sided depending on how the chapel spawns
---
My guess is he was hacker. I went to save a hooked survivor and saw him walking around killer swings. I was suprised and looking from distance. Killer noticed me looking and stopped chasing bill and got me. After dying I was looking at his gameplay, he was able to repair gens and was saving other survivors from hook. And whenever killer was near, he starts walking instead of running. One thing more that he didnt save any survivor if killer was close. He also saved the first hooked survivor only when killer came for me.
---
But I have fun using mori against streamers
---
I wish I could say there was.
---
Only the pussy survivor main portion of it
---
Yes, this one in the video does not represent us.
---
This is probably the most cursed thing I've ever created in SFM.
---
If you dislike the stigma that is shown towards player-created wikis and want to "battle it", not listing the sources for your informations is not helpful in any way.
---
Fact is, the wiki has caused lots of confusion in the past precisely because of the lack of sources and overzealously adding information that is not set in stone yet.
---
The most recent September Bloodhunt (mis)information is the latest example of overzealously adding information and shows why the stigma against player-created wikis is there in the first place. People trusted that the wiki is as accurate as possible, spread what was written there and now we count the cost.
---
Incidents like this are the very reason why we continue to remind people to take any information about upcoming content on the wiki with a grain of salt. [Which, by the way, is also recommended by the Community Managers of the game.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/657495#Comment_657495)
---
I've been playing for a while but never figured out how to burst out of a locker? (PC)
---
"super sonic mode" (i assume you're talking about windstorm add-ons) doesn't matter when looping
---
Can't say I've personally seen it happen, but that's the nature of RNG, it's random.  Any of the survivors bring any luck offerings to the trial?
---
He for sure mains him. He usually boasts about running basement builds on him, I never watch him but from clips I've seen and what I heard about it, is is at least a decent chunk of his killer gameplay.
---
well, the difference is that nurse gives information to react to. Personally, my only issue with nurse is her extra blink and range add-ons, her base kit allows for counterplay and mindgames.
---
3 decisive strikes, yikes
---
all the fucking time -.-
---
I do. But I think the other outfit he wears is cooler (Blue hoodie, Joy Division t-shirt, black jeans).
---
That is how you get a series cancelled bud
---
[Thiccness with the Slickness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-08iFX8ScI4)
---
You can't hear the spirit near you if she channels her power while you're in her terror radius. You have most definitely been playing against bad spirits.
---
Hey this doesn't look bad!
---
Knowing Konami they'd give us the Butcher from Origins or another offbrand Pyramid Head.
---
Pls format your post so it isn’t a massive wall
---
May I point out that there have only been two incidents in 3+ years of the Wiki's existence? You make it sound like it happened a lot more often, which is not true. And we cannot be held responsible for people not reading the homepage of the Wiki stating that it is run by players and not the developers.
---
Hold shift + space
---
Sorry bout that didn’t notice the nonexistent formatting until after I finished the post
---
Pretty much, Konami has done everything in their power lately to destroy everything the original games had that made them great. And then to top it off, they green light a game that has the potential to be great, and then immediately cancel it
---
Hooking someone far away from exit gates when all gens are done is its own reward. Plenty of time to down someone else if they get an unhook off.
---
When she is near you using her power there's like a vacuum sounding noise while she's near you, you can most definitely hear her creeping up on you
---
I like this a lot. Well done.
---
M1.  Phase.  Open Ears, Follow Scratch Marks.  M1.   Wipe sweat off forehead.

Try playing spirit at a rank below 8, not everyone is brain dead

Aaaaaaah yis. *swooonk*

I’m the guy who misses the skill checks

Okay then

Hi

Someone on the official DbD Forum is using your Status Effect icons for an entry into the Beginner's Guide Contest. Since there is a clause in the rules that states that you cannot use someone else's content, I wonder if you've given them the permission to use these icons or not. They mention they are yours, but that's not really the same thing.

---
I kinda wish they had picked a more fitting name
---
I originally glanced over it on my list because it sounded like your average crime show or something a lot more mundane
---
1. If the killer can down a recently unhooked Survivior and their savior then it's 100% on the Survivior? Have you ever played against a camping killer? They know how to force hooktrades, and it isn't that hard to force them. If the killer downs the unhooked and the unhooker within 60 seconds of the unhooked being saved, then the killer was Tunnelling or camping. 
---
And if a god killer deserves those 2 hooks as you have said, then killers who lose all 5 gens dont deserve a speed boost and instant down on Surviviors who did their job, so by your standard, Noed and all endgame perks need removed. 
---
2. 40 seconds is not a long time. If anything I'd buff DS so the timer doesn't go down if ur within 20 meters of the killer. It's an anti tunnel perk, it's allowed to be powerful
---
It'll be on DVD
---
This cropping is a hate crime.
---
Hopefully
---

---
I didn't mean in her terror radius. And calm down dude I'm just trying to have a conversation
---
Sure, man.  That's why Spirit is top tier, right?  Nurse -&gt; Spirit -&gt; Billy are all you see at Red Ranks.  Why is that? It's not cause she's "super fun" to play as.
---
His bellybutton is heart-shaped.
---
WAH
---
I have a friend who has 19 viewers on average during streams, and every other stream he'll put TTV in his name for advertising. The amount of tunneling and camping, and Moris he gets for no reason even though he plays fair and just wants to expand his viewer base.
---
Oh I’ve seen that. It’s old.
---
I once had a game versus a huntress with Blood Warden and I was waiting in the exit gate and the other leftover survivor threw down a pallet and kept vaulting it right outside of the exit gate. As soon as blood warden went up I left and didn't tell him anything the wiser. As the Huntress was carrying his body out the exit gate I just nodded at her and she nodded back. Was satisfying seeing that douche die lol. This video takes the cake tho.
---
A night shroud ghostface, a crouched pig,   cloaked wraith, Tier 1 Meyers any killer with tinkerers, dark devotion and insidious will not proc borrowed time (provided the perk is active)
---
Not at all. I really think they need to get rid of post game chat, i don't even understand the purpose. Put in some stock "good game" messages and leave it at that.
---
This is new...
---
lol
---
I usually just suicide on the hook when I get basement wraiths.
---
I mean, they've recently added cosmetics to licenced characters and even a whole rework so I don't think it's entirely out of the question
---
Lockers prevent moris lol
---
He's just as fast as most other killers...i believe 110% 
---
Ghostface is decent but he's not overpowered
---
You should take a closer look at the sidebar if you like the passive aggressiveness of this post.
---
My I introduce to you to...
---
#CLOWN?
---
what rank are you? hes like the low in the middle tier i could tell you why if youre interested but know this, you. are. a. clown.
---
I always watch small time streamers, and I'll usually pop in and say like, " Hey, killer here! Good luck, closing the stream down. " and I always play fairly.
---
Even then they have the audacity to sit there end game and talk crap after I give them a fair game.
---
Some people deserve to be mori'd. Just because you have a fan base doesn't mean you should trash talk others. Those 10 people are there because they choose to be, don't be a dick to keep their views.
---
“You husband now”
---
All killers are 115% except Hag,Spirit and Huntress who was 110%
---
Nurse is 96%
---
Wanna sit down and talk about what the big bad mods did to you?
---
They're so annoying I swear! Then they tbag and run away lol
---
Man, I just played a match and he 1 hit my whole team. I don’t want to hear that. I’m rank 16 lmao so talk your shit I guess but I would appreciate some actual advice
---
Of course they DCed XD
---
Three reasons in no particular order.  
---
1.) Throwing hatchets is fun and a lot of people play huntress because they prefer sniping people to smacking em, even at short range.
---
2.) Hatchet add ons. All of her add ons effect her thrown hatchets and make all the difference in her chase. If you have Berus toxin then you can hatchet a survivor and prevent them from using any exhaustion perks which can easily cut a chase time in half.
---
3.) Attack recovery after throwing a hatchet is incredibly short especially compared to a successful melee, giving them less time to create a gap.  
---
If I'm close to a survivor and they are already injured, I'll usually prefer melee over a hatchet, but otherwise if they are healthy then it's practically always better to use a hatchet.
---
Lmao every map is like that when you're as unskilled at killer as I am
---
Family life and he's been ill. He'll go back to it soon.
---
Healing in the corner while your teammates are on hook is the best you can do tho.
---
Lol. Hag is so scary
---
Jfc you tunneled the shit out of that poor Kate.
---
It's fun to play against Spirit unless she's running Prayer Beads. I use Spine Chill most of the time so I don't get yoinked. I like having to be creative with my jukes instead of standard looping. I want more killers that can straight up change how chases work, although not being straight up broken like Nurse.
---
He’s quite sick. He is still doing regular video releases tho
---
Its kind of his whole thing to put the exposed status effect on you and then 1 hit, you can look at him to stop his stalking but if the ghost face is good you probably won't see him till you are marked
---
Fantastic!
---
I like it
---
It started blowing up again on this sub not too long ago.
---
Bond
---
If you have red ping for more than 10 seconds in a lobby I’m leaving
---
He can only expose you with a clear line of sight so during chases and moving around stick to cover. If you can use walls its easier.
---
Mmm....no.
---
I do the thinking that ur art is of the good kind
---
don't you have friends to talk to ?
---
Then your obsession will be a pink hair nea with 4000 hours who knows every single map by square and is a master of looping
---
*(also, its a shit perk in general and encourages tunneling but that's beside the point)*
---
Again, pretty sure its not actually fatal or anything, but his break is more than warranted. I'm genuinely surprised he's still sticking to his youtube schedule.
---
At low ranks you're getting facecamped by Wraith
---
I was gonna write this T-T
---
Yeah, they shouldn't allow reaction images with a caption. Sorting them out would help against the low effort meme spam.
---
TL;DR: Queue times are too long for killer and so survivors shouldn't leave the lobby.
---
just know that when you rank up you will see more ghostfaces and when you hit rank 8 you will abruptly never find another ghostface in your life and just go against billys, nurses and spirits
---
oh just you wait. Sooner or later you'll get the guy that practically sprints into your mouth over and over, and then the whole team goes ballistic on you for tunneling.
---
Gotta love Ko-fucking-nami, right?
---
I get lost in those fish eyes every time.
---
I mean, the Karma speaks for itself. It's a JOKE!
---
He has a  small blog on his YouTube go read it. Basically he's having a tough time and needs a break.. I am more than happy to wait for him
---
I dont think the law cares as much as you do on this one
---
GG
---
Ayuwuki is that you?
---
The improved Quentin’s face is cute precious baby.

Current Quentin’s face is 30 year old meth head, who looks 20 years older because of meth
---
5 blink nurse with DH and Ebony: Allow me to introduce myself
---
I've waited 10+ minutes before for a match but that's usually at low ranks and at night. You'll probably get matched very quickly when you just start the game though. At rank 2, lobbies usually take around 5 minutes so you can just go on your phone
---
He just attempts to escape the hook 3 times and not struggle.
---
Game for Ghostface Myers and Pig
---
For Nea Haddobfield
---
Nice! Looks like you put too much *focus* on the cosplay :D
---
And by low I mean ranks 1 through 6 or around there
---
They weren’t face camping there back camping
---
Oh trust me I know that was the bane of my existence sitting at rank 2. Can't blame the killers though she's the best choice on console by far
---
I will literally never forgive them for Silent Hills. The first game in years that looks like it has potential and they shitcan it immediately
---
I’d rather play survive against sonic wraith than nurse or spirit in high ranks. Smh
---
I don't call stuff like that a juke. I call it dodging a hit.
---
Or Bubba :(
---
Dunno, never had trouble with them. I had toxic teams, but its just a game, never once they ruined it for me, from my perspective.
---
&gt; I had no idea her crouch attack counted differently!
---
It's a recent change! It used to count as a regular attack
---
Credits to monto
---
No it just means I'm right and you guys are afraid to be called out. I keep hearing you guys say that but I have yet to see a joke 🤦‍♀️ If shirtless characters and sexualizing characters and stupid ideas for killers/survivors that have no relation to the horror genre is your idea of jokes then you need help for real.
---
Waahahahah
---
Dwight there on the right, is looking like he's about to snitch on his older brother... hmmm...
---
His name is actually Dwight, can't remember the name of the tv-series, but it is a prime thingy
---
Use Spine Chill and he will never creep up on you again and use Dead Hard preemptively. Not when he swings but when he is close enough to swing or use it to get you close enough to a pallet or window. Dead Hard also works for Trapper traps if you use it while running over them.
---
You did get fucked pretty hard by lag. If it were me, i wouldnt have risked it due the lag alone, not to mention speedy billy on the map. I dont think it wouldve made you a bad teammate, just one who knew when to cash in his chips.
---
Right
---
oh also, something like discordance/save the best for last/ sloppy butcher/nurse's calling works great on her. track multiple survivors, get STBFL stacks, keep them injured
---
agreed, he's a really positive influence in the community, but I want him to take his time and get the rest he needs while he deals with the condition. Shit like that can be made infinitely worse by stress.
---
I've have plenty of people spin around me a whole bunch. It works like the 2 two times but on the third attempt I always get them.
---
She dropped down afterwards and ran away.
---
more meant situations where someone gets unhooked and basically sprints at you.
---
It’s based on a comic book series so not really possible
---
in my experience both TTV and teabagging/flashlight clicking tend to go hand in hand, so for me its one of the "early warning signs" to just go full meta with mori (others include but are not limited to: p3 squadette, 3+ flashlights, key&amp;map)
---
I don't always use the mori, but I just wanna be prepared. Many streamers think they gotta be toxic/trolling to be interesting to watch and want to be next ochido/noob3, so it's more about making sure I spend as little time as possible in game with them to not be a part of their "content"
---
also I'm a simple man, for me if you feel you're good enough to promote yourself as a dbd streamer, you should be good enough to go against a mori. After all I'm not streaming and I gotta put up with brand new parts all the time (I know, it was nerfed, but I've been playing for a long time and the nerf is still quite recent to me)
---
With that and the shit storm around Kojima (plus the halfass attempt at MG: Survive), they lost a massive amount of fan base loyalty. Good thing they focus more on pachinko machines and mobile games nowadays.
---
Ahhh ok. That's happened, but I think people don't notice because I've been playing wraith.
---
Hope your day is still great!
---
I actually like these. God only knows how atrocious they might be in practice, but it’s a pretty creative concept I think. 8/10
---
Who else pressed the X to close the picture.
---
...'cause I definitely did not do that. Nope.
---
Fair enough
---
&gt;no terror radius for the whole match rather than just at the start
---
with monitor and abuse he has an 8 meter tr and with addons it goes down to 6 meters, and with addons and no monitor it is 12 meters so mikey scares, exposes everyone at once, is taller, can stalk at all times and has low tr at all times but he doesnt have infinite stalk and has to stop stalking people so he can pop tier 3 on them, so he has to distribute better his stalking of survivors, he requires more big brain than GF
---
Use spine chill and dead hard.
---
I just wish they’d sell their better IP’s to studios that actually care
---
Wait, the matchmaking is bad at the moment?
---
It's not a bad thing. But I don't think Yamaoka is bad for trapper. The traps are almost impossible to see in those bushes.
---
Idk maybe I’m just bad with that map even as survivor I suck on that map
---
Lol no one gives a shit, it's a game... were you a toxic camper? Maybe... does it really matter in the end? No....
---
Is trapper a shit killer and requires a actual god player to win at red ranks without camping tf outa hooks? Yes.
---
Wow. Get off your high horse, dickhead.
---
It's not a prime show, it's The Office
---
Not a bad thing. Just the community being the community
---
wow this was a tranquile conversation. i played hag a goos bunch ofgames and it's easy to put a trap in the middle of the loop, so don't get annoyed of my opinion please :)
---
I'd probably go with Clown. 
---
The big thing in this game is loops and vaults and his ability is meant to slow them down so you can catch up.
---
Yeah, I feel bad about it, especially when OG Freddy at least had a few fans, but at least Legion is a character you can get with shards. 
---
Still pretty salty if you already have him, but you're less likely to have spent real cash. Hopefully they use this opportunity to make Legion something new, like a fake Survivor as their trailer implied.
---
Play for fun not for surviving or for getting 4 kills. Play to have fun and this game is high ph instead if toxic lol also turn all your messages to friends and friend requests to friends of friends while playing. People get salty and point fingers instead of pointing at themselves for their own actions.
---
Yeah, but you can still watch The Office on Prime... but, don't quote me on that, I have no interest in it.
---
Shadow Copy is too strong. No thanks. And the point of a hex being cleansed is that it's gone.
---
It's the same on Xbox. I just want endgame chat tbh, I'm not gonna message every player just to say gg.
---
My big worry is making Ruin an even bigger pain in the backside. I don't run it as Killer because it's a giant pain to play against as Survivor, but it sucks when you're just screwed over by totem placement.
---
&gt; and it's easy to put a trap in the middle of the loop
---
You mean while in a chase? This is only a good idea if you have speed placement add-ons
---
They should add the trench coat he wore in that one film
---
Thats pretty funny lol. The other day i kept running into shit and wound up climbing up rocks and boxes lol. And after that game, killer inboxed me a bunch of screenshots of them on the roof of larrys
---
Oh ok, I know you can watch the UK Office on prime, I didn't realize you could watch the US version too
---
Personally me too. I don't want to go about messaging EVERY FUCKING PLAYER to say gg.
---
Or as Trapper, place a trap in that doorway and walk through your trap. :D
---
Probably gonna save up to buy him but for now which killer is Good for new people like me
---
Agreed for first timers, helps you observe and understand the base game mechanics before shit gets crazy with perks
---
I feel so terrible because last night i met a toxic swf really altruistic group and they fricken gen rushed me, note im like rank 14, and i was able to get hits on them all through out the game but the only way i got a 3 piece in the end was noed
---
Eh, 95% of survivor mains do everything they can to be toxic then message you post-game with personal insults and most of the time tell you to kill yourself ROFL. Without fail, that's why I have to take anybody complaining as not being just a clown, but the whole dang circus.
---
I liked the alliteration of J’s. “Janes got the dodges” doesn’t sound as good
---
Not how it works but ok lol
---
That's literally the exact same build I'm trying to get on my Piggy (just bought her)
---
It's also the exact same build I use on my Freddy. Love that perk setup.
---
Also, in my opinion, Brutal Strength is way better than Enduring
---
Sorry for being a noob but what is dead hard and how do I get it
---
Game is good for doctor and hag too. Being a small map, it's nice for killers in general.
---
Or you took this off some guy on istagram hence the watermark
---
I just told you. Clown is a killer after all.
---
I had it happen with nea when I sprinted off a gen stopped when I got back on tho
---
This game is to stressful to enjoy as killer.
---
Whatever makes you feel better about yourself
---
I am more worried about how strangers words got into you, its a game and you were the Killer. 
---
Build some confidence and carry on, you did nothing bro.
---
Buttcamp
---
I do, thanks for asking! But I'd rather help a random stranger. :)
---
I have no idea what that is.
---
But he was replying to  "basement wraith"
---
They don't need to be really. I think the current state of the game in terms of horror is fine since it's not trying to be a "scary" game to me.
---
It's more like a thriller which isn't a problem.
---
A perk from David also we were all noobs at one point
---
I went with the Wraith personally because he's only got one attack and can cloak, which allows him to move around much faster.  It's pretty simple but he's an effective killer in the right hands.  Perks and item attachments modify how you'll play the game, so make sure to read the descriptions of perks and items to make sure you understand what they do.
---
For Franklin's Demise, is the item dropped on the first hit or the second
---
Coldwind farm is a pretty good realm for huntress. You have a lot of open space and usually gates spawn really close to each other and you can camp both gates at the same time with hatchets.
---
Omg I'm so exposed I can believe you called me out
---
True true
---
No, it's basically useless.
---
Please no small billy in a random corner of the meme again. That shit was just as lazy as the current image flip spongebob memes.
---
Oh it is... It is
---
The smaller maps are generally better for killers. Huge ones like temple of purgation, Ormond, mothers dwelling and yamaoka's residence are all survivor oriented
---
I mean, she's the disciple of a brilliant engineer and designed several of her own traps (or at least modified them significantly.)
---
She's got serious training that no other character does when it comes to electronics and machinery, besides maybe Doctor with his love of ECT.
---
One of the things that brought me to and kept me on DBD during my first many hours was the fear of being caught and the adrenaline rush when you are hiding behind something and the killer is very nearby. I totally understand if you don't think they need to make it a better horror experience but do you have any ideas of what they might improve upon? Even just speculation?
---
Not many, and it's killer dependent 
---
stealth killers do well on gideon's and lery's (except wraith who struggles on lery's)
---
other than that it's really only shelter woods, which can be fairly well balanced depending on pallet spawns, but that massive middle dead zone will always be rough for survivors 
---
oh huntress is really good on blood lodge
---
For me, when I play with friends it makes it less immersive and thus less scary, but the game itself can easily make me jump and scare me. Especially hag players!
---
The hate gets shuffled around each patch, tbh.
---
First hit.
---
All of them when i was new. Unexpected Hag traps and t1 Myers now
---
haha funny sex number 
---
laugh
---
laugh at the joke guys
---
Reaching Rank 1 isn't really a noteworthy accomplishment because ranking up is so easy. Please add them. Or do a poll. A poll sounds great.
---
yeah ur right, but if you play her good you force the other guy to go away to another loop, but in bad maps or in lategame it's a hard thing to do. but i forgot to mention that all of this we discussed is different through play styles and players abilities.
---
I think OP means that he doesn't have the funds to purchase the Clown at the moment, so who would you recommend from the base list of killers not included in any paid DLC?
---
We dont have a confirmed date yet.
---
LOL, that happened to me once, trapper that i played against when i got this glitch, if you're reading this, im sorry for running you with Dbd equivalent of Sonic
---
There's 2 versions? Well, Sweden is in europe, so is UK (surprising I know). I don't know which version it is, nor what the difference it is, or if there's even 2 versions off The Office on our Prime Account... (I just realized how "serious" I took this...)
---
For me spirit is less fun because it doesn't feel like it matters what you do as the Survivor. I personally find Huntress, Billy, in nurse way more fun to play against.
---
ive never been a mod before but if you need help, i can lend a hand.
---
Freddy is a good starter in my opinion
---
Among the free killers, almost everyone recommends Wraith to new players. Easy mechanics to get a hang of the game.
---
Among the ones you have to buy, clown is easy to learn and fun to play imo.
---
It's WAY easier to keep eye of Spine chill in the upper perk since you don't have to look at all the other 3 to confuse you.
---
Why does he start sounding like vinesauce joel at one point? Lmao
---
I kind of want Smol Billy back but not as a rule. If I ever make shitposts again I'll be sure to insert a Smol Billy
---
I thought they did say that in a post on the forum?
---
If you are talking buy with cash i'd say leatherface.
---
Not only does he have one of the best perks that doubles your BP on the side, he's also easy to play and learn the game with.
---
Later on, in higher ranks, he's not good anymore but early on you'll have success no doubt.
---
If you mean shards only you could check out the hag. Again she has another great perk that everybody uses all the time, and she stays strong even in the higher ranks. Might check out a video on her first (she's not fun for everyone).
---
Other than those two i'd get doctor. He's just plain fun to play and once you learn how to use his shock correctly can shut down loops as well.
---
But then we'd have to have actual thought out posts and discussions! /s
---
Well the UK version takes place in England and it's the original version of The Office, even though the US Office is the most widely known version. I'm a pretty big office fan if you couldn't tell. There are other versions of The Office in other countries but they aren't nearly as widely known as the UK or US versions
---
just added you, GT is YouTube Repli, don’t mind that though gonna get it changed soon lol
---
Honestly I'll take nurse over spirit any day.
---
Yeah smite does this. Would make dc'ers pay more for their actions
---
Yeah! I had a good game as freddy with a streamer and we both complimented each other
---
I can't laugh when you can't take the time to rotate your darn picture.
---
Nothing, I think in terms of making people fearful and giving that adrenaline rush it does its job pretty well still.
---
It will. All these streaming shows have come to DVD and BluRay.
---
Yeah hag is especially brutal since it also takes control of your camera which makes you run into walls n shit lol.
---
Too bad the baby dweet couldn't just hand her a hatchet.
---
Killers really gotta make it all about them don’t they
---
I mean, moris are more entertaining than death by a hook
---
Ah, I see, I didn't really understand since his post is just talking about buying one then he says he can't.
---
If he wanted a current killer, then Wraith is pretty easy for newer players.
---
And then because it makes me jump, i don’t know what the fudge is going on because my camera is all over the place!
---
What did it cost ?
---
pretty sure even a nokia has better anti-aliasing
---
Its about a slasher movie, not an horro one, wich is not exactly the same.
---
Also, the survivor know (even if they dont think so) that they are in the power role. Maybe not with nurse and the top tier gang, but most of the killer rooster is too weak, so they dont feel the opresive atmosfere from films like km 666
---
Let the people have Fun wtf
---
If this jokes aren't refined enough for your sense of humor Just don't look at them
---
You may not like It but people still have the right to make harmless jokes and If you have a problem with that YOU are the one that needs help
---
"Trapdoor"
---
Would you like him as user flair?
---
That actually sounds like an interesting killer kind of like a mix of doctor and plague
---
HMU if you’re on Xbox and fancy playing some time! My GT is mxsie. :)
---
Adding an extra box and then making their auras invisible to trapped survivors is definitely a fantastic way to go. Survivors will often not complete gens so their ally can remove the trap first which can give you awesome map presence. Take surveillance, trap a survivor, find the gens that are worked on, kick em and then circle back if they are touched again by the survivors.
---
Dude wants the full experience
---
That’s why I said semi-enforce. Small Billy was very very low efforr but at least a bit more than made with memeatic spongebob reaction image #3463224
---
I know this is going to be bad, if they don't fix the ranking sistem in match, it could be that many of the new players end up against purple or even red ranks and that's not gonna end good
---
The pizza Dwight has been found!
---
Only clips i've seen of angry pug is when other dbd youtubers play against him and use a clip of when he gets mad, like in one of Demi's videos where angry pug accused him of using crosshair and called him a loser because he got a good hit with a hatchet.
---
People just use it to switch obsessions
---
Nobody:
---
The Doctor:
---
Check your fps cap in the config file
---
???
---
What are u saying?? Coldwind Farm is the worst map for Huntress because you can't throw over the loops.
---
That's an Adam, ma'am.
---
Why do people use shadowborn on Nurse?
---
Lol clickbait
---
Lamo
---
What Bubba needs a perk for, Wraith can do naturally and better.
---
#wraith gang
---
They change the names of things all the time, so definitely possible.
---
Oh no I just started, this was literally my first day playing so I don't really have anything ahah
---
I think Billy would disagree
---
He has made a statement in one of his dbd vids, he's dealing with Depression and stuff like that and just wants to take a break. But he said he will stream the ptb 100%.
---
Azarov's and also Suffocation Pit.
---
The man was trying to show off his asset. You should be happy.
---
I find it personally to be the opposite because I rarely get a decent twitch streamer, and if they stream like how they played in my lobby then no
---
Like all correct minded human beings.
---
He was very thicc
---
Depends on the licensing agreement
---
? i wasn't angry. if you were talking about it then it would be obvious you'd never vsed her. am i wrong or?
---
you remind me of those meme with the happy mask and the nobrain crying picture behind it.
---
Juicy
---
lmao that Adam is a friend of mine and I'm so used to him being Dwighty that I miss it
---
Right I get it, thank you! But I have a question, can I only get killers with real money or can I grind for them?
---
Not really. Only Rotten Fields.
---
You're right, he did say that in his original post but then stated something different in the comment you replied to.
---
but spirit doesn't really lose when she makes a mistake anyways, and it doesn't take much to win with. I'll happily die if the loss feels fair and earned.
---
I'm the one that needs help yeah ok lol!
---
Awesome
---
^
---
Yeah I prefer doing that with Premo.  I usually walk towards the direction of the killer when the alert goes off, and hide, so they end up walking right past me.
---
Well until BHVR stops giving crappy totem spawns, I'm gonna offer ways to make Hex perks last longer. Sorry.
---
? im literally salthooks, i posted it here first dumbass. look at my other posts on reddit I'm the same person
---
Oh
---
sUrvIvoR bAd kiLLeR gOoD
---
Because it can be useful to give advise and talk about the game?
---
What do you do in this situation? Surely you can back up and make him come far enough in that you can take a hit and run.
---
So make hexes way OP on the Badham maps, Lerys, The Game, and the swamp maps. Got it
---
God, I used to be a Wraith main, just had my first match as Hillbilly and it was alarmingly fun and easy.
---
The flamethrower power would make them become legion 2.0
---
A reworked idea: gas canisters.
---
 Using M2 you can charge and throw a canister, any survivor hit with it or passes through the gas will become "flammable" for X period of time.
---
After hitting a flammable survivor with a basic (M1) attack, the survivor is burnt, giving them the broken status effect for X period of time. You have a certain amount of cans before you have to go to a location to refill your cans.
---
While they are burnt there is the feint crackling sound of them buring for the first half the time they are broken, with the second half being silent aside from the injured grunts
---
(This rework was done using two of the most balanced chase killers in the game. Clown and plague as inspiration)
---
It’s honestly disrespectful to the legacy of some of these franchises, I get that they’re a business, and money is their concern, but seriously they’ve gotta realize that it’s detrimental to their public image
---
Been listening to him since I first heard the outro. Superhuman has got to be my favorite.
---
I can play Michael and try to stick my knife in your ass.
---
LMAO. If you cannot consistently flash light wraith when he appears you are one boosted mother fucker.
---
I let the last survivor escape every time
---
Yea, hillbilly and nurse both have special exemptions for what would constitute a good map. Large open areas like the wreckers maps are great for Billy but not so much for other killers. He is a special boy.
---
Oh yeah sorry bout that names didn’t match up at first sorry
---
as far as 3 genning goes? eh, i guess. to a much lesser extent, though. and the jungle gyms in the middle are a lot stronger than the azarov ones and suffocation also has a fairly strong building. so i would not say it's killer sided
---
The general feeling of 100% guaranteed moments of safety that you have as a survivor. Virtually every medium of horror (film, television, novels, even counting stuff like haunted houses) works on the concept of never truly knowing if you or any of the characters are safe.
---
Just look at the movies that DbD licensed and think about the suspense that is created by the danger of the killer or the moments leading up to finding the killer. Mikey could be stalking around any corner, waltzing silently through a building and murdering everybody with ease. You could be asleep and not even know it against Freddy. Not having any idea who is a part of the Sawyer family and knowing that Bubba could be just around the corner with his chainsaw.
---
All of this stuff is invalidated in DbD with the exception of two killers, Nurse and Spirit, which is why they are the two most hated killers in the game from the perspective of survivors. They are genuinely scary but they are put under the guise of OP (which they are compared to other killers) as they take the agency away from the survivor and put it in the hands of the killer, making survivors feel unsafe when and where they previously once would. Near a pallet against Wraith? Slam that shit down, even if it's not optimally timed you are 100% safe for a bit. Huntress got you on the ropes? Not if you near a high wall she doesn't. Leatherface? That chainsaw might as well be a kids toy unless you are in an open field.
---
Even the idea of you getting smacked by a hammer by a giant fucking hulking hillbilly with a chainsaw attached to his hand, you know that you are safe briefly after getting hit and sometimes you are even safer than before (Dead Hard). It's a weird concept and I can't even really call DbD a horror game because after about 20 hours of playing survivor all the fear goes out the window and at red ranks, the roles are basically reversed. 
---
Looping me through the killer shack? Fuck I bet it's a SWF and somebody has Head On in a locker so the KILLER IS SCARED TO GO IN THE KILLER SHACK. Sweet, I downed that guy but his friends with instaheals and dead hard are gonna body block me and they have 99%ing those hooks, I can't do anything I'm totally screwed please help me, etc. 
---
If they wanted to change this into a more horror oriented game, you would up the stealth for killers. I've always thought the red stain had no place in the game when you aren't in a chase, it's just a dead giveaway and is takes even more of the suspense away. In a chase, it's a fine balancing option but take it off of EVERY killer when outside of chases for a more ominous feeling.
---
np
---
Yeah you usually can bait and take a hit to get out,   I have been completely stuck before but it was only once.
---
Yeah and I play the spirit to have a chance of winning, but no survivors will bitch about me for playing her, what do you want me to play, fricking bubba? Like I'm trying to win too yah know.
---
You know, you could offer... anything, besides "it sucks", a cap on 1 save perk hex perk, have the totem itself dissolve over time, anything. But whatever.
---
There is a bucket inside
---
No?!
---
This, is a bucket.
---
Dear God...
---
There's more!
---
No!
---
Interesting idea but it kind of seems to incorporate the weaker parts of those killers. Allowing either the cans or the burn to help the killer catch survivors would make this idea solid in my book.
---
Well seriously it makes ruin an even bigger pain in the ass and it buffs fucking NOED. what do you expect?
---
I'm talking about the 3 gens thing. Suffocation is pretty hard if you get a bad rng in the middle of the map, you can have TL loops into jungle gyms and shit like that. Azarov's is more killer sided in that sense.
---
Thank you, I've only ever watched Bricky play it so I have some understanding of the game, I'm enjoying Wraith but I really want better perks on him (I know some good ones to use on him so I look forward to that), thank you for your advice!
---
Spirit is counterable, you need to be less predictable and learn when its appropriate to be aggressive and when to run. She still can be easily looped and pallet stunned so it's not like the nurse entirely
---
You could replace it with a key and get the same result
---
Do you not play with sound? How do you manage to get hit by a Billy coming from far away?
---
Yeah, my idea was to have a sort of 3rd ability (kinda like GF's crouch) that would allow him to sense burning/gas covered survivors.
---
Well I'm on a losing streak so that shouldn't be difficult ahaha
---
Suck my unit!
---
😂😂😂
---
I mean it was supposed to be a bit op since it was a shitpost. Honestly tho I think it would be pretty good because 7 seconds really cant do much tho
---
Isn't looping the thing that is fun in this game as a survivor?
---
Kill the Twitch
---
okay gotcha. but the 3 genning is a special kind of wew lad on azarov's lol altho i noticed that not too many killers really try it there. because it's pretty boring to do i guess?
---
nobody has a problem with you specifically, they just hate how the spirit works. there's plenty of ways the spirit can be strong without being a total guessing game.
---
don't play bubba he's garbage.
---
I love those fireworks! I get a lot more saves with those than flashies
---
\*baby meg
---
It's like running in cicles to avoid being beaten by a fat kid, it's not funny, it's ez
---
i don't... get it
---
I mean monto came up with this meme
---
I love the mindset of this game. Survivors are the most toxic, bitch ass players of any game ever. But will cry and cry when a Killer plays *smart*.
---
Survivors put themselves on hooks if they camp a pallet or fuck up beyond belief
---
Have you ever played against a red rank billy lol?
---
It's boring but if you face swf team you need to do that if you want to win.
---
ahh I love happy endings
---
That ending was gold.
---
He move
---
Cool. Another meme for people to make relatable crap with.
---
As the baby Dwight who still potatoes skill checks frequently, I am sorry
---
Spirit allows counterplay and info to react to it's really hard to argue your side because theres kind of nothing
---
shhhhhhhhhh, #wraith gang
---
(they extremely need to make the move speed buff on windstorm part of the base kit)
---
I've vsed her many times
---
jane can jiggle but not juke
---
I suck with flashlights but I have mastered the art of saving people with firecrackers
---
Be kind. Rewind.
---
DbD has a seriously toxic community unfortunately. Just try to not let them get to you and move onto the next match. Play the way YOU want to play! Who cares what other people think as long as you have fun!
---
Which is why I offered downsides to using it with those exact perks, I expected some reading comprehension and discussion, not 1 sentence replies.
---
As a Wraith Main, I played Spirit this morning. I was actually floored at how much more fun the game is. Spirit is wraith on easy mode.
---
Idk why but I really like his stun sound
---
Well, tomorrow tomorrow, since tomorrow's PTB is for dedicated servers and the bloodweb changes.
---
But yeah.
---
Read the pinned post dude
---
I dont think new players will go in on PTB. Especially not to test dedicated servers tomorrow.
---
Are there any gens that actually only have 1 door to get to them? Or is Lerry's the closest thing we have?
---
Should have all Goten ghostface dings and then he just joins in
---
i don't think there's going to be many new players from stranger things playing on the dedicated servers PTB
---
THAT DUDE.
---
Beat me to it lol.
---
We're not the developers.
---
are you upset for some reason? I'm only trying to make people laugh.
---
the goofiest shit that has ever happened to me was when i lost pips on one role when my game crashed in the lobby for the other role lmao
---
Was in the pregame lobby, and my PlayStation froze to the point where I HAD to pull my power cord. (Holding the power button won’t even turn the console off when this happens and it’s ONLY on DBD that this happens ever. It’s happened 3 times in less than a week, every time it’s on DBD in a pregame lobby, and every time I lose a minimum of two pips, or a maximum of 4 pips! My friend on SWF who I was with also somehow lost 4 pips after the match was canceled due to me not connecting. 
---
Are you fucking kidding me BHVR? I’m seriously worried for my console’s health, Ive checked it and done the proper steps to make sure it’s not the console having issues. It’s literally DBD and it’s pregame lobbies, 2/3 times it was when the countdown hit 5 seconds, locked in and transitions to the offering screen.
---
Should I only focus on one survivor and killer and get them to high level? I like playing many killers and survivors but I'm wondering if it's a bad idea to spreadout my BPs.
---
Doctor is really good at low ranks and his perks are really useful at all ranks
---
Invisible cunt=free upvotes
---
...This is an issue with your own console, sorry to tell you
---
And I say the same back for swf, it's nothing toxic it just too strong to beat with a low tier killer, so don't be surprised if it's a spirit, billy, or nurse
---
This. I don't mind pink add-ons for killer or survivor, but I hate the mentality that Survivor's pink add-ons are some how disgustingly broken. Considering they can only use them once during a match, compared to a killer's multiple times (Pretty much whenever they use their power), I think it's pretty fair. Especially when a lot of the Pink Add-Ons have no drawbacks for killer, where as Survivors do. (And then you have cases like Nurse, where pretty much any add-on on her that isn't Heavy Smoker ones might as well be pink for how powerful it makes her.)
---
Oh okay. Sorry I don't know who that is. I didn't mean to plagiarize anything. I didn't think I was being clever (I'm sure most people thought of it at some point) I just wanted to visually create it as if it were real.
---
Thanks to u/SybieWee for the template! Had a few other ideas for perks but I tried to stay meta relevant and come up with something that could positively affect the meta.
---
TF2 comes to DBD? 🤣
---
Lol BHVR does do something against camping and tunneling. That's why Survivors have perks like Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike, and killers get a fuckton less points for doing it. (Seriously, I've played Insideous Basement Bubba before. The higher you get in the ranks, the less points you get for it.) 
---
DCing only puts your team at a disadvantage. Why DC when you might have a teammate coming for you who has Borrowed? Or when you have the satisfaction of knowing that you did something to piss the killer off (Hopefully in a non-toxic way, like just knowing how to run loops) enough to where they're face camping you because they're just that angry at you? 
---
Really, if anything, facecamping/camping is just funny imo. To me, as a Survivor, especially if I was chased long enough for a few gens to be popped, I'm satisfied. He might be facecamping me, but that means he's given up the game to secure a single kill. It also means as soon as the one ultra-altruistic teammate saves me, he gets to go for round two with me when I hit him with DS. 
---
(Don't get me wrong, I'm not for bullying killers or anything. I'm against toxic killers and survivors, but hey, if they're going to facecamp and tunnel, then you bet I'm gonna try my best to spit in their Cheerios, since that generally just means their a bad killer. And since I play in decently high ranks, usually around 5-6, it means they're probably boosted.)
---
Would be great.
---
Nope
---
That's okay, we're all a little dumb sometimes
---
1. Look around while you’re on gens to avoid getting snuck up on
---
2. Break line of sight as much as possible to avoid getting marked
---
3. Look at him as much as possible to keep him out of night shroud
---
4. (And this is a personal preference of mine) Run Spine Chill, it not only lets you know when he’s trying to sneak up on/stalk you, it’s just a good detection perk in general.
---

It's a visual bug only, you don't actually downrank at all
---
which is a tragedy
---
it would be adorable, not annoying like when everyone spammed changing characters
---
Sounds dumb af
---
Laughing too hard at this 😂😂😂
---
Moooooood
---
then possibly. it's worth reporting
---
“What the fuck are you doing???” To killers who tunnel me and eventually hook me, wasting a crazy amount of time
---
i dont get it how are there 3 bad wheels on a shopping cart usually there are only 1
---
A deaf spirit is counterable, yes. Otherwise it does not matter about "predictability". At a loop you simply stand still. The survivor has 3 options, stay there, drop/vault the pallet, or move away from the loop entirely. The survivor would have to predict the exact moment the spirit entered phase to get an escape. Which is actually luck, and if you're injured it doesnt matter when she's phasing, you're dead. If the survivor moves to your side, its a free hit especially if you collide with the survivor. If they dont move you can phase to their location and get a free hit. If they run away you phase and follow scratch marks. If the scratch marks stop you unphase and you get close enough for a free hit. There is no winning. Then you're injured which means you're essentially dead. She isnt a nurse, true. But she's still insanely powerful.
---
nani?
---
Bill without Borrowed Time? Holy shit you’re useless lol
---
Lol right 😂
---
40% of the time, it still happens everytime
---
All the screaming from the snares, hitting, and fake unhooks makes this so hilarious. It's a shame minor bugs screw up the game sometimes.
---
God, I hate how much this sub has become one large "fuck survivors" circlejerk.
---
Lol I’m using bill so they thing I do  almost a waste of a perk slot since they always think bill has it.. it’s like using Laurie and thinking the killers gonna actually pick u up
---
Killers whine about survivors looping the ironworks window or groaning storehouse 3 times until it’s blocked but that would be the smart play for survivors too so it goes both ways
---
Beautiful.
---
Is there really any point to prestige if I don't like the cosmetics? Like I've got all the perks I want and plenty of add-ons/items, so it just feels like a waste to get rid of them.
---
How do you know which slot each perk goes in?
---
Lol yeah, it's kinda sad. Wraith needs a rework imo, probably Trapper does too.
---
Did the twitchie die
---
&gt; Survivors will often not complete gens so their ally can remove the trap first
---
Sometimes. It used to be the go to strat but not so much anymore
---
Because it was a large 'cry about killers winning' circlejerk for the longest time even though the game was and still is entirely designed for survivors to win. Remember pre-balanced landing?
---
The image of the event poster was datamined. Dbd released a statement saying that the date was never confirmed and with the upcoming dlc it's going to be a bit longer. People got excited for it because they saw the poster but it kind of got lost in translation that the poster was datamined and the event wasn't real yet. I found it kind of funny because the article released said something like, we're sorry if you're upset that the event isn't happening yet, but the image was taken before we were ready to release it... Etc. Regardless, the event will happen, just a little bit later, we just don't have a date.

Jump rope slows the action speed considerably while outdoor slows moderately

---
60 seconds i believe.
---
Which preschool map?
---
I just played a game with the high tier tape that makes it so they can't see boxes and had two heads pop! Thanks for the recommendations!
---
They’d also think a Bill had Unbreakable...
---
Damn you’re lucky, I get none.
---
because she's black, right? ;D
---
Ur right that’s why I took it off 😂
---
You're welcome. I'm having a look-out for that stuff as many guides use icons they have no permission to use.
---
shirtless david would turn into shirtless shape
---
nah. i mildly regret my prestiging
---
How do I do that?
---
Who the fuck uses spine chill?
---
If I’m not broke then, sure thing I’ll watch it. I love Karl Urban anyways
---
 Nope
---
From the 5th to the 9th
---
What exactly does blood warden do
---
That fact that u sat there for that long doing that means u deserved it. So yep it’s karma
---
sounds like someone has been using a lagswitch or something.
---
Helium perk.
---
It's bc he has a bunch of ass kissers in chat, he is an asshole and that's why people like him. I have played against him so many times and killed him every time so he def isn't good. He gets a significant lack of viewers when he isn't drunk though.
---
I'm not exactly sure which one, I'm pretty new to game so I'm still learning the maps.
---
Why not use? Not always I want to use the same meta build, and Spine chill is a solid perk for when I just want to have fun
---
Firstly, welcome to the community!  
---
I almost wrote out a 5 page essay on how to start on this game but thought better of it, maybe I'll make a starter guide in the future but here is a TLDR/W.  
---
Getting BP: Use killers to farm BP because its easier to do well with them, especially at very low ranks (13-20). If you can spare it, buy Leatherface for BBQ and Chili perk which can double your BP per round. He is usually 5 bucks but is on sale via humblebundle for 3 bucks for the next 9 days: [https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-by-daylight-leatherfacetm](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-by-daylight-leatherfacetm).  
---
Spending BP: Choose ONE survivor you find aesthetically pleasing and get them to prestige 3 (level 50 three times) as quickly as you can. Then level each other survivor to 40 to unlock all three teachable perks (these appear orange in the bloodweb and make the perk available to all other survivors bloodwebs). Then you can use your chosen survivor as your main mule to consolidate items, add ons, offerings, and perks.  
---
I would recommend that you prestige characters as soon as any of them hit 50 so you don't fall into a sunk cost problem where you've spent millions of BP (literally) on a character and don't want to give up their items just to prestige. I'm kicking my past self over this right now.
---
Use items and add ons as much as you want, they are not hard to get and there are even perks that enable looting rare items from chests in game.
---
The only offerings I would recommend you use early are BP offerings until you get a feel for what the others are good for. Make sure you adapt your playstyle to maximize the BP bonus from the offering.  
---
I have so much more to write but it would quickly get out of scope for the question so feel free to ask any more questions!
---
Yeah I love this jacket on Nea too! Thank you so much &lt;3
---
Thank youuu &lt;3
---
I feel pain for you. Rank one ps4 is, well fun’nt
---
Well played
---
Glad you like it! &lt;3
---
Almost every game where the Survivor side has been able to fight back (F13, Last Year, Deathgarden) has ended up failing hard. Survivors shouldn't be able to fight back.
---
Thanks, that counts as a good compliment for me &lt;3
---
Oh my..bring it 😉
---
And also rank 1 killer but lobbies are being pretty good actually.
---
No, I don't, actually. I don't recall which killer I joined after but I know for sure I was playing after Legion had been added, but before Plague. What was it like pre-BL?
---
It's hilarious seeing how often I miss survivors because my eyes are focused on something else.
---
Is there a way to combat the lag spikes that happen literally every skill check? Everything is running smoothly then a skill check happens and the whole thing just grinds to a halt
---
I've had this happen with a hatch on Yomoaka Estate and was super easy to see, I hope they patch this out lol
---
Ahh now that makes sense forgive my ignorance Ghostface keep being a good papa
---
oh fuck, right. i forgot that being drunk was his gimmick lmao
---
streamers that get a shit load of viewers like that tend to get some colorful characters from diehard defenders to devoted haterade chuggers to people who are straight up creeper deluxe (umbra in particular gets some creepy people in her chat i noticed)
---
I don't understand good ping is a plus for everyone. If you rely on lag to win you probably suck.
---
I can confidently say that if I get a trap on my head and notice I can't see the boxes, I'm already tilted AF which makes me play more stupidly.
---
So should I delete this?
---
I got three people with blood warden. 
---
I chased a Kate to the other side of the map and the others stayed at the doors. The Kate got hooked and the others realized they fucked up. 
---
Everyone was disappointed in the endgame chat that nobody had recorded it.
---
DC'ing is definitely a strategy, it gives the last person the potential to get the hatch if it's just you two and you're slugged
---
Is there a way to browse this subreddit and filter out all fanart and cosplay?
---
I see it often but that could be because I do it all the time for my fellow survivors so I probably influence my games.
---
As far as I knew, skill checks were local side, like the killer has nothing to do with it. Outside of your own setup, internet connection and system you can’t do much.
---
BUCKLE UP CUZ HERE WE GO
---
So this could be stupid to some people, but I’m really confused. So when BBQ &amp; Chili was in the shrine I bought it. Since then I have leveled up Freddy from 0-47 and Huntress from 20-32 and still have not gotten the option to unlock BBQ even once. I know perks are random, but it seems weird that I still haven’t gotten the option yet. Is this normal or did something possibly mess up? I just really want the option to use BBQ lol. 
---
TL;DR: If I bought BBQ in the shrine why have I still not received the option to unlock it yet?
---
I hate when the baby survivors tbag him when he's stalking cuz they think he's just being a tool and not chasing them lmao
---
Take my advice with a grain of salt but I hear it helps to point your camera at the sky while repairing gens so you have to render less things
---
I have just under 900 hours in DBD on PC and have only came across 1 instance where there was something informative said. The majority of the time its survivors shit talking either the killer or each other and once in awhile just GGs.
---
Will dedicated servers mean shorter wait times for a match? It's hard to grind when I'm waiting in the lobby longer than I am in the game.
---
Cheers to the people willing to suffer through what will likely a horrible experience from Dedicated servers for us so we don't have to.
---
Doesn’t help that they made 5 versions of the worst map :P
---
There's no real point no, the cosmetics are usually ugly
---
You should try to get multiple characters to high levels, as their unique perks become available to unlock for other characters' bloodwebs at level 30/35/40 so while not unlocking weak perks this way is advisable so as to not clutter up the bloodweb perk pool unlocking powerful perks for others is highly advisable (for example, with Adam Francis you'd be commonly advised to unlock Deliverance because it's great and Distraction because it's fun but not Autodidact because it's horrifically bad). However, spreading your bloodpoints too thinly is inadvisable, because getting each character to, say, level 25 both severely delays any attempts to unlock new perks and limits the number of opportunities you have to get other characters' perks on them if you only intend on levelling them up to 40 before focusing on another character. This is especially an issue for killers, as while the survivors' playstyle is mostly portable as long as you give someone else their perks (different survivors having different sizes and visibilities aside), if you have a rough run of bloodwebs for a killers you enjoy you cannot recreate that playstyle by switching to a different character with better perks.
---
250k  Bp would be nice
---
Appreciate the upvotes everyone! If you'd like to see more, feel free to take a peek at some of my other works! Once again, thank you all! [https://www.artstation.com/nemesysnv](https://www.artstation.com/nemesysnv)
---
Daddy Mike, of course
---
Your character must be looking at him not just your camera. Also run spine chill it completely counters his stealth and is also in general one of the best perks in the game
---
If this isn’t me every time I see or hear the WAH WAH bitch
---
Imo the issue with her is that virtually anyone can pick her up and do well with her. Nurse is obviously stronger but she also has a significantly steeper learning curve.
---
There’s always Until Dawn characters that have traits. Mike, Jess, Matt, Needy Emily,Sam, Ash, Chris, and choice doesn’t matter boy Josh
---
Is there something that triggers rollback? My friends and I were playing last night and my game crashed mid load (Another ancient problem). I get back on and I see my bloodpoints are lower than before. Realized I got rolled back about an hour or so. Then my friend gets on this morning and he also got rolled back some. Is there something that triggers this or is just one of the many problems BHVR doesn't want to fix?
---
Lmao
---
On rare occasion, I'll scout out NOED. I usually only do that if I'm playing with super altruistic teammates who I know will get themselves killed or if I'm in a SWF if the timer isn't active.
---
I never do that.
---
I just rage quit when I'm about to die.
---
But seriously, never a good idea to do that. They'll probably get another kill
---
I was thinking about a bp reward, would be good to at least get rewarded.
---
This happened when I went to pick a survivor off a gen as they DC’d
---
People didnt hate spirit this much when she came out, now all of a sudden its hip to hate on her, smh why
---
I don't think it has what we would consider a true physical form the closest thing to a physical form ww get is when survivors get sacrificed
---
very cool! accurate to her model too.
---
nO neeD American XbOx
---
I love Wraith.
---
Granted I play at rank 15 or higher
---
I don’t think so. It’s the smartest thing to do when I door is opened. I don’t normally face camp, but I do proxy pretty hard when the gates are open
---
No
---
If you hook someone while a gate is open you block both gates for 60 seconds, punishes assholes who hang around in the exit gate area for no reason
---
End of season rewards should have been a thing since day one.
---
oh god oh fuck meg look out hes behind you
---
Excuse me being a major baby, but what does DCing even do for people? All it does for me is piss me off cause ive been trying to level up quick cause I uh... May or may not be a lvl 10 baby.
---
He... 
---
he ran right around it. F baby dweet
---
where the fuck did you get that from lmao OP never said anything like that
---
u r doing the projecting dance
---
Sometimes y'all define camping very loosely. Pretty sure the answer is to just take what you get and bear it from either side.
---
Thanks man I appreciate it. Here’s to me getting good luck I guess lol.
---
The fact that the killer is just simply controlled by another player like me and it's not AI
---
No no, im not critisising u. But you play dbd and not know the twitchstreamer/youtouber monto??? Look him up ;) he is a good player! I just wanted u to know he thought of it ;)
---
everyone who has ever played killer even once has been called a camper for absolutely no reason
---
Nah, every ghostface cosmetics has some sort of bright safety reflective bullshit on them.
---
lmak
---
You look like a big dork when you run those two though :(
---
I’ll t bag till the cows come home
---
i'd imagine that it'd be the case? i mean, connecting might just take longer because of individual connections. i could be wrong, and this is kind of hypothetical.
---
I lay down my life for my random teammates every chance I get, the matchmaking was broken on this match, Nea was rank 16 and the nurse was rank 2. We both got out.
---
Imma throw something at you
---
Spine Chill is so underrated.
---
Amazes me this is what they say about Nea  of all people
---
Dredd 2 please
---
aparantly not
---
You don't HAVE to run Iron Will, it just makes life a little easier until you get used to the playstyle - and not every Spirit is running Stridor.
---
As for doubling back without collision, you don't run straight back towards her - you *predict* her route and banana around it. 
---
It's about the mindgame. If Spirit is certain you're going to the next loop, they're not going to expect you to double back - and if they expect you to double back, you'll have time enough to get to the next loop.
---
Only if killers can see what perks survivors are running to dodge lobbies /s
---
I'll tell you first thing that when the exit gates are powered I'll prime one of them with the intent of rescuing whoever's hooked, so no it's not toxic, it's just smart and obvious play.
---
The devs said it so why not
---
I just want something cool looking yet isnt a giant neon sign
---
Pirating The Boys? Fuckin diabolical
---
Matchmaking is just broken right now but they're tryng to fixt 😉
---
At first I wasn't gonna down vote you but after those edits I've changed my mind
---
I Love PainReliever. Great videos
---
Shut
---
Yeah with freaking Jingo Fett 8.
---
I don't even think it's most. The bad survivors and killers get more publicity. Every time someone calls out a toxic killer, we deal with an influx of "lmfao ok toxic survivors" but killers calling out toxic survivors are met with "fuck all survivors, entitled assholes".
---
Biggest issue with the community is both sides have issues remembering just because the game is killer vs. survivor doesn't mean the community has to be.
---
&gt; how do people have so many perks n Good ones too?
---
They've used Bloodpoints to buy them - either through the Shrine of Secrets (changes weekly) or by owning the survivor/killer and unlocking the relevant teachable to L30, L35, or L40.
---
Once unlocked, a teachable has a chance to appear in any other Bloodweb. As a new player, Bloodpoints will be important to you - so many would suggest getting Leatherface so that you can use his Barbecue and Chilli perk to potentially double your Bloodpoints each game.
---
Once you have unlocked that as a teachable you'll be in a good position for playing other killers and getting more BP. 
---
[Here's a pretty neat guide for survivors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goi0knDvpGI), it should give you an idea of priority. Survivors are essentially just reskins, so once you have the "important" teachables you can then go nuts on the survivor you like the most. Personally I wouldn't level up any survivor that doesn't have a teachable you want - that way you have a chance at a good teachable from the very start, when they'll be cheap. If you immediately take your "favourite" to L50 then Bloodwebs will be expensive and perks harder to come by - at least until the upcoming patch doubles the amount you can find.
---
[This is the killer version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49wygOeZ5I), but note that different killers can prioritise different perks. Hag and Cannibal/Leatherface are probably the two most desirable, though - Barbecue and Chilli for the Bloodpoints, and Hex:Ruin because it's a strong method for slowing the game down at the start so that you can build some momentum.
---
Good luck!
---
The hag walked in right as I went on the stairs and didn’t see me
---
i loved it when GF came out and people where like "now we can BM like survivors". some people on this reddit are so unaware that killers bm 24/7 they just assume killers cant do it at all.
---
You serious? lol
---
The hag walked in right when I went on the stairs and didn’t see or hear me
---
Thanks so much!!!!!
---
I'm at rank 14 and I keep fighting smurfs
---
no. It was before but now she can hear survivor sounds while phasing which means that she doesn't have to guess anything.
---
I accualy have some splinters for pig and Myers I'll try them to see if they are fun thanks for reminding me of that :)
---
anyone can make their profile private
---
This is the time where you can best make 1000 IQ plays and get a 3 or 4 k but as far as securing kills go, yea, you are best to not go too far from the hook and see how risky/stupid the other survivors are willing to play to try to get the save.
---
Hey, just wondering if you where the laurie that DC'ed against that  doc on haddonfield the other day bc our teamate was AFK the entire game. Not shit talking just wondering &lt;3 (yes ik its from jojo and its a popular name.)
---
I have a lot of fun with the spirit or bubba
---
&gt; skill based actions
---
I'm planning on maining her alongside Nea and Tapp.
---
I agree. He teaches new people to hide, hook bomb, and sets other bad examples.
---
Congrats I guess.
---
That's why a lot of people derank themselves. Everyone is toxic at rank 8+. Made me quit the game for awhile.
---
With this in mind as killer I have hooked near the other exit and opened the gate to get the timer started. This can get some survivors panicking pretty good 😁
---
damn. thats sad
---
Well she didn’t
---
ya its very situational, but since i play the hag im small and blend in so it works more often then if i was playing say the clown
---
it is a perk that needs a rework tho its viability is so small it kills me
---
umbra prob gets creepy chat in chat bc (im p sure at least) she is a girl. its somthing dumb with twitch and white nights
---
Ive had a few ones where it felt like a swat team. Toxic teams are easy, since they all want you no gens get done!
---
wrong Post?
---
just play barb and chili. OH WAIT DESD BY WONT GIVE ME IT ON MY FREDDY REEE
---
Damn you for living in Germany ! Nah just joking. It is fucked up how living in Germany apparently makes you a Nazi. It saddens me to see how some people (yes I am looking at you DbD community) can be so toxic.
---
I don't disagree but the only reason i have a problem with him is that if i run ruin I get a guarenteed 4k.
---
You aren't a Nazi just because you live in Germany but you are an ass hat because you say ez after a game
---
I like both the pig and Myers. The pig is way more fun to play though.
---
Pictures you can hear
---
Myers is lots of fun and his perks are solid. Pig is good but has a very unique and semi challenging playstlye. Her perks are not as good but still alright.
---
So play Nurse then
---
Just wondering, do you watch Blissfuls channel on Mixer?
---
well writing "ez" us just annoying, especially when it comes from the Survivor with the least points, but that doesnt justify the "nazi" ofc
---
that isn't really a spoiler
---
Survivors do
---
she didnt what?
---
yea true
---
This but unironically
---
re-start the application
---
Message support.
---
I mean, this isn’t really impressive though. Why is this play of the day?
---
No one is mad, you're just being a loser weirdo
---
It's not an advantage to survivors, it's removing their disadvantage of having to throw fucking dice everytime they vault a window to see if they are gonna get hit or not.
---
I agree
---
It’s really unfair because you would still have 5 gens and only 3 people to do them. Not all that bad, but then it depends on what the killer does, and most wouldn’t hesitate to kill everyone back in the day. Honestly I was happy when this change first arrived, but god damn it now cancels all of my matches. I’d like to get the option to opt in these matches either way because at least I could play the game.
---
Just get good tbh
---
Restart your app
---
Sendo my the link please
---
For a survivor it just denies the Killer sacrifice points and screws over their teammates, if the Killer DCs all the survivors immediately 'escape'. In both cases it'll likely mess up peoples' pips because of the shonky way that's calculated.
---
In this particular case it looks like someone's game crashed during the loading so the Entity just called No Contest. I didn't lose any pips or items
---
You write 'ez' after a match then come crying to reddit when someone responds? You may not be a nazi but you're as weirdly sensitive as one.
---
Run into a streamer who played a camping Legion at rank 7. Played with him 3 matches and nothing but camping. My rank got lower thanks to that. The last match we end getting some dcs. In the chat he just called everyone salty and that we should have done the objective. We told him doing the objective alone wont give us a pip and there was nothing to be salty about because there was no game to play. I watched his stream later and he was deranking on purpose to the lower rank to bully new players for his views.
---
Is P3 Claudette really that hard to see or is it just the memes that are over hyping it?
---
Get whoever you like to play. Try to get those offerings to play others killers. I would wait to buy until after the  demogorgan comes out tho.
---
I'm just dodging every queue with multiple flashlights, otherwise I'll have to do the same.
---
Is this in game graphics. How’d you make this, it’s a pretty cool picture
---
Scp 106 has breached containment
---
All weekend it’s been like this. Almost every match I’ve played has had a DC.
---
Like acting in relationship to what the killer is trying to do, pull up team actions to save someone, distract and do gens, not just sending the best surv looping and all the others genrushing
---
Why is there no voice chat? I feel like it would make sense if all the survivors could communicate with each other through a voice chat or at least a text box, especially if you’re solo.
---
Guys , i allready have my Killers back, thank you soo much for helping me :D
---
I would main Leon for days bruh. But yeah good ideas.
---
Ripley!! ☺
---
There are some really good youtube videos out there for learning basics, so I'll just throw out some stuff I find useful:
---
-The dash attack is situationally useful. When you surprise a survivor on a gen, it's often better to just stand up and attack them as usual (especially if you have Save the Best for Last, as dash attack hits do not count towards the cooldown tokens). 
---
-the flip side to the dash attack is that at certain loops it's very effective. Picture a smaller loop on Autohaven: When a survivor wants to loop you around a pile of trash with a pallet on one side, you can crouch at the pallet and dash attack to catch them before they can get back to the pallet. You can even fake one direction and then turn and catch them running the other way. 
---
-Because of the above strategy some people just run away when they see you crouch at the pallet. If you notice someone doing this you can crouch at the pallet and stand right back up. They'll be running for another loop and you can chase them down in No Man's Land.
---
Pig's biggest weakness, like most killers, is that you can loop her and her chases can take a while to come to fruition. For that reason I pretty much always run Bamboozle (15% faster vault speed and blocks off the vaulted window for up to 16 seconds, which I personally find to be more useful than spirit fury or enduring) and Save the Best for Last (which gives you 5% faster recovery speed after a successful attack up to 40% based on hitting survivors who are not your obsession) and then Ruin (to slow the game down a little bit) and then whatever I'm in the mood for, whether BBQ, Surveillance, etc.
---
Hope this help!
---
Don't run when you hear her phasing lol?
---
Funny how on his "first game" he had tier 3 on at least 4 perks and was level 20 to have 4 perk slots.
---
I'm doodoo and I get salty
---
I'm Shure judge dredd is getting a show
---
Is it sad that I only know who 2 of those people are?
---
I think he's talking about the bug where you can't escape or use any activateable perks.
---
Same!
---
Which ones :)
---
Wonder why the deaths/survives were cropped out?
---
With a few stacks it can be a counter to Borrowed Time, specifically when survivors are crowding the hook and you end up in a chase. It can also be used to cancel out the TR boost from Monitor &amp; Abuse, which can be useful on some setups. Aside from the TR aspect, Furtive Chase can be combined with Remember Me to very quickly build max stacks on the latter - 2 for the first Obsession, and 2 from the second Obsession when they unhook the first. Alternatively, you can use it bounce Rancor around - would work best if you just put the unhooked survivor back on the hook and let the new Obsession run off, although you won't be popular.
---
Smaller TR in chase also makes it easier to "fake" a chase, or to mindgame survivors - they can't be sure whether you're chasing them or not.
---
Specifically for Legion it means the Deep Wound timer starts ticking down sooner, though the price you pay is that your Killer Instinct's tracking takes a big hit. Not necessarily a problem if you're running another tracking perk.
---
I wouldn't say it's particularly useful in a "general" build - it's a very specific tool for a very specific job.
---
Where’s Ash
---
Why does the entity play a game of hide and seek, predator and prey, with everyone if its clear it can kill and harvest everyone at the snap of its spider fingers is it for entertainment?
---
Hey man, getting chased isn't the only way to play you know
---
Ripley, and the sheriff, I can't remember his name but know who he is.
---
Rules 2 and Tampered Timer are my favorite combo on Pig for this very reason.
---
It's all about feeding the entity hope or something like that.
---
I'm gonna be playin all week trying it out. I can't wait for the shit-fest that'll be the servers. Hopefully it'll be fun!
---
Source Filmmaker.
---
Let's not forget in this clip he has steering addons which also have a downside, the stun is a lot longer than 0.5 seconds

So I’m a survivor main, but I play killer a decent amount too. I played Billy with movement speed addons (default charge and steering tho) and could’ve 4ked this SwF at 5 gens, but I didn’t want the game to be over so quick as I played a Hollow Shell, so let the rank 3 Nea go. She unhooks and I start chasing her going for silly chainsaws. Eventually I lose her then she starts pointing and shit trying to taunt me. Pretty damn funny considering I literally let the game continue. Then I saw their ranks, so that’s pretty embarrassing for them.
---
I imagine if they come into the human world, they would possess someone
---
Tucker &amp; Dale! Yes. That movie had me dying laughing. 
---
Also Rick Grimes has my heart forever, it’d be really cool to see him in game but I’m not sure they’d ever do that.
---
Cool
---
1) almost no one would use it
---
2) why would anyone want to face verbal abuse in-game from squeaky teenagers?
---
I've noticed that sometimes she really can be hard af to see like in the darker parts of The Game I have had one run by and only knew because of scratch marks but I also dont have the greatest eyes
---
I spent over a million bp just trying to get bbq 1, got 2 and 3 in the next two bloodwebs
---
Rick Grimes
---
Ok
---
Everyone I play against seems to private their profiles. Then they talk shit in post game and leave comments on my profile saying I'm this, that, and the other even if I'm not. It's honestly kinda funny.
---
I think he's asking if NOED would replace Haunted Grounds in a situation where the last gen is popped where only 2 totems (both haunted grounds) are left on the map, then one of the Haunted Grounds totems is activated, meaning the other one becomes a dull totem. Would NOED take over that dull totem or does it only trigger if there's an available dull totem when the last gen is complete?
---
Good question OP, I never thought of it before.
---
When I normally camp the hook after exit gates are open or the survivors are making a plan they mess it up and give me more kills.
---
DOOR STUCK! DOOR STUCK!
---
Probably talking about the guy stepping in traps
---
And now I guess I'm a huntress main
---
&gt; Does my progress I have in the base game carry over to the PTB? (Bloodpoints, character ranks, etc)
---
They take a snapshot before the PTB and whatever you have at that point is what you get to use on the PTB
---
&gt; And then does anything I earn in the PTB carry back over to the base game?
---
I figured it was something like that.  Thanks
---
Nice.
---
So play a boring strat to maybe safety pip seems a little silly to me, but it's just my opinion, there are many others who will completely disagree with me, and that's fine.
---
Hmmm. Suggestion?
---
Y'all have never played spirit against skilled survivors
---
all the more Nancy for me
---
Yall ever blink without a cooldown just to flex on the nurse?
---
Then she doesn't see scratchmarks stop and reach me with her burst speed.
---
The only counterplay to Spirit is her not using a headset. inTEraCtIvE !!!!
---
I had barb 2 at level 22 Freddy. I have only the teachables for spirit unlocked. I haven’t gotten it at level 47. Just my luck I guess :(. Really wish I could get those sweat bloodpoints
---
Yeah, I was the one recording and on the ground. He was in the distance with the traps.
---
He was talking about the guy in the trap lmao
---
Just cause ur playing someone dosent mean you have to use their teachable perks
---
Ugh, I looted a rainbow key with no add ons - DC!
---
Will always upvote Plague. Favorite killer to play as and against (except when my idiot teammates cleanse immediately!).
---
I have always been a dwight main. Guess im a papa dwight.
---
I missed ONE skill check last night &amp; someone messaged me after they died asking “why were you popping all the gens?” BRUH what?
---
Who would win: a fast af twig armed skinny girl or a pink puff boi
---
After so many hours nothing is scary. I watch movies that I loved as a kid and teen that scared the hell out of me and now I just laugh at them.
---
How did u get them back Incase this happens to me?
---
Ok that's fine, but boring doesn't equal toxic
---
&gt;the one of the two killers who actually have the power role
---
&gt;no counterplay
---
And that's how you get a killer nerfed to F tier
---
If killers can have an SWF toggle sure.
---
looping as survivor is the thing that require the highest experience and skill, like it or not it's just a fact.
---
Taking the right decisions at the right moment isn't "skill". It's analysis.
---
Looping require analysis too, game knowledge too, and skill.
---
PRACTICE?! NEVER, IF I'M NOT ABLE TO INFINITE THE KILLER AND PALLET STUN HIM IT HAS NO COUNTER PLAY, BROKEN &gt;:(
---
Claudette: Hey, that’s my line!
---
I only see 2 killers. Oh, and the Entity of course
---
I once healed 2 teammates even though we had exposed
---
I think a Resident Evil chapter would be fantastic! It has a plethora of bad dudes to choose from (Nemesis, Mr. X, Birkin, etc) who would have some pretty unique abilities. Conversely, it has even more survivors to choose from. I'm sure one day we'll find our way to either Raccoon City or the Spencer Mansion.
---
It's good you didnt lose anything from it, I just kinda wish players were less toxic in this game especially. I never actually disconnect even if its 5 gens for just me, but it also sucks cause I'm like a rank 19 baby with no idea of what strats and what the meta is.
---
Either way, we should still be nice to people going forward. We don't wanna turn anyone away by being massive dicks to them.

If you like better rarity items appearing on your blood web more often do it but if you don’t want to lose your perks it’s fine.

and why did you write that? this has nothing to do with my comment lol
---
You husband now !
---
Go to the setings - accont management&lt;restore licenses
---
&gt; won't get more bloodpoints
---
Funny thing is if they're on death hook, the DC bonus is more BP than death, granted the killer hasn't maxed out in the category DC bonus goes to.
---
and Ruin (but most players will have Hag, only pc players with the base game won't have Hag)
---
LOTR is also getting a show with Prime. Netflix and Hulu better watch their ass.

I actually find it funny lmao

On pc? I’m on ps4
---
That's Rick Grimes. Others (In order) are Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield from Resident Evil, Frank West from Dead Rising, then Tucker and Dale from Tucker &amp; Dale vs Evil, Shaun from Shaun of the Dead, and lastly R.J. MacReady from The Thing.
---
you can unlock her without money tho
---
As someone else has said- you didn’t deserve it for being German. You deserved it for being the cunt saying EZ.
---
OHHH Thank you so much! I was totally misreading his question ahaha
---
I'll be the baby then.
---
How do you use the insta-heal add on?
---
it says secondary action but it never pops up
---
true, I completely forgot about shards for hag and doc lmao
---
SPEEDO QUENTIN WHEN!?
---
I got level 2 on my legion pretty fast after buying it in the shrine and got stuck there with her, so I was farming bp on her trying to unlock it on others. It took getting just about every other perk and (tier 2 and 3) before it showed up  so that might explain how I got the 3 in a row on huntress, so I'm gonna farm with her and work on another killer, either nurse or wraith probably since I have the most perks unlocked on them. On a plus note, I now have 22 iridescent hatchets.
---
&gt;i enjoy just bluntly running into the action
---
Hillbilly. The definition of "running into the action," he's the fastest killer in the game because of his chainsaw dash.
---
&gt;i also enjoy playing smart and stealthy
---
The stealth killers are Wraith, Myers, Pig, and Ghostface. Wraith is the only one available for free, which is unfortunate because he's the weakest of the stealth killers imo. I'm a Pig main personally but Myers is pretty popular in some circles.
---
I recommend you watch some gameplay for each of the killers who interest you. Youtube is a great resource for learning about the killers, how to play them, and whether they'd be fun for you.
---
PS4 dude
---
And this is the reason why I left red ranks after being there for well over a year. 
---
The only reward you get for ranking up is **no longer having fun.** 
---
I stay in purple/green ranks my man, where I can play goofy builds/weaker killers and still enjoy the game.
---
Bitch is trying to outrun her own scratch marks
---
New to the game, I know The Pig isn’t great but the few games I did play her were really fun, but I wasn’t getting much BP, so I started playing The Shape instead, and have been doing well, getting decent BP, a good fraction of games resulting in 4k wins etc. (currently Level 28 atm).
---
My question is, is it worth buying the Leatherface DLC to get BBQ teachable and playing him to grind some BP for The Pig and other killers, or will I find it difficult to play him, hence rendering the bonus BP and level 35 climb useless, compared to doing decently and getting a cushty BP earn with The Shape. Especially long term, I’m assuming BBQ will help levelling up other killers so there’s that, or will it rotate back to the weekly store soonish?
---
Is that Shawn from Shawn of the Dead?
---
He MUST be on DbD
---
On Ps4, you can see who the killer is if they are appearing online, if they aren't, you can just dodge ez
---
tragic
---
ye and the other Licensed Chapter dont really offer any Meta Killer perks
---
Yeah I mean I’m already gettign 50k a game but ima be a PC schoops ahoy steve so I really want that extra 25 percent
---
*actuvate windous*
---
lmao so tru
---
in his "rank 1 mindset" video which, by the way is not the rank 1 mindset.. maybe it is as that video, he literally plays a clip of him not bodyblocking to save a teammate and says it's good gameplay
---
Fucking glorious
---
On PC the default is Space Bar
---
same
---
Definitely not, you have no other objective and you are securing a kill. That doesn't mean you should just face camp, try to outplay and get a grab or something.
---
Microsoft decided to do something weird where you can now see your recent players instantly (it used to be on a delay). 
---
So that means survivors joining a lobby can see who the killer is immediately.
---
What episode was this?
---
Bruh they design it for the opposite hahaha but good try
---
it's kinda obvious... people hadn't figured out how to play her to her full potential. she's fine when she isn't being played to her full potential.
---
Saying that doesn't make it true, lmao. Good try, tho.
---
The gang gets trapped
---
It appears that someone didn't know what the purpose of a PTB is. The dedicated servers in the first test were to see how the game runs  with it, not the final design.
---
If you want to avoid the harassment, turn off the ability for non-friends to send you messages before you play as the killer
---
Same exact thing happend to me. She would miss it then hide in a locker. Then just as i was almost done she would come back and immediately miss another skill check. Rinse and repeat.
---
The perks from left to right go bottom right left top
---
Thanks I’ll try that
---
Ah, so I shouldn’t count on it being in the store anytime soon then, oh well.
---
Someone posted that it’s on sale on Humble Bundle so I might as well grab it, like you say it won’t be much of a bonus to start so I’ll see how the games go as to whether I commit to the grind right now. Thanks for the advice!
---
Demo's power doesn't look fun to play as, so probs Steve. Plus I feel like it would be more fun running away from a Demogorgon than playing as one, especially such a lackluster one
---
Start walking if you hear the phase sound and get off a generator if you hear it too as the spirit can guess which side of the generator you are on and pull you off for a free hook just don’t rely on it too much as they can equipped add ons that decreases the sound of the phase if you run while she is in phase mode she will catch you right away because your scratch marks will lead her right to you and she’s faster in phase mode I recommend spine chill since it tells you when she is near and her phase doesn’t take you by surprise and lightweight so it’s harder for her to track you by your scratch marks.
---
so doing their objective. blame it on the survivors for not cleansing dulls and opening random chests.
---
blame it on survivors for not wanting to just waste time wandering around.
---
blame it on survivors because you didn't chase them off a gen.
---
those stats are all well and good arguments for your point, but acting like survivors are actively trying to genrush you as if they did it to ruin your fun is not fair.
---
if you wanna complain about it, go to the devs with your feedback.
---
that being said if you wanna discuss how it can be countered feel free, personally i think they should make each dull totem slow gens by a % and add a totem count to the HUD. make them an ACTUAL side objective that survivors will feel pressured to participate in, in order to complete their main objective.
---
this also solves the noed argument, kill two birds with one stone.
---
I don't play survivors
---
Where is the killer?
---
yes, i realise people don't have fun against her and that's exactly why im going to keep playing her! let's make the game as unenjoyable for the other side as possible! /s
---
isnt that why you level most survivors
---
she takes some skill, but not much.
---
you need general game sense, as with all killers.
---
apart from that all you need to be able to do is to listen. buy headphones = profit.
---
For the whole game the billy was just a pair of legs with a floating mallet.
---
I've seen ping spike when people join and I also heard that when it randomly spikes it means the killer is looking at profiles since it tabs their game.
---
I know it's tough to work out the particulars, but I still really want a The Thing chapter.
---
B...but i wanted hatchets!!!!
---
I'm new to this game, but I see this sort of meme pop up often. What's everyone's problems with Quentin's face?
---
I'm not blaming it on the survivors ofc, mine was just a way to make fun, you also shouldn't blame killers for bringing a mori, since the devs added it. But then I'm wondering who likes 2 minutes games?
---
I needed this answer for science
---
Who says they were smurfing? Maybe just playing with a newer friend.
---
Not to mention you're the one in this photo that has the most meta build
---
Right back at cha my guy/gal/person
---
Flashlight tips? 
---
1). When is the optimal situation to stun the killer? Is it when you stun them with a pallet? Or when they're breaking your pallet? 
---
2). Optimal add ons? I've been using odd bulb and the green battery. 
---
3). Are you still supposed to aim at their neck?
---
she takes 0 skill. all it takes to play her well is a pair of headphones
---
anyone who says "x amuses me" is actually seething
---
That reminds me of a game i had the other day.
---
Me and this Meg took turns running the killer around while this Claudette finished the last gen, Meg was caught and thrown in the basement and the Claudette just opened the door and left as I went for her.
---
That turned out wonderfully as we both died in the basement with the shitty Wraith

Hey hey hey no, survivors have the right to be cancer and supertoxic, but spirit? Spirit no, spirit is the worst. Dbd survivors main are lame lol
---
If you have 2 survivors bum rushing the hook, which is the current meta, it's not boring lol.
---
I bought the game for myself and two friende when it first came out, and remember some of these a few months in and just thought the game was lame and dropped it for about a year, only to deal with all of this shit. And I played OLD wraith on top of it.

I might dump my blood points into demogorgan just cause I want his perks. Besides that I’ll be putting all my survivor perks on Steve

Normally the killer always wins in 1v1, obviously without the hatch play. To help you at least have a chance to win it you can run these perks and item:
---
-Purple medkit with speed and charge add-ons. Healing with only the perk is really slow and gives the killer more time to find you. So bringing a medkit allows you not only to heal faster but also to bring an additional perk
---
-Left behind: I think this is obvious, in a 1v1 situation your repair speed will boost up by 150%, granting you the ability to finish gens really quickly.
---
-Iron will: Chases will happen sooner or later, and this perk makes following you harder. Just use a lot of LOS breaker to maximise the impact of the perk.
---
-Diversion: In a 1v1,every information about your position is crucial and getting in a chase will mean almost always win for the killer. If used right and aimed at lockers, gens or any object that can send a loud notification to the killer will make them go and check. They can also ignore it as they'll understand that you're using pebbles if you messed up.
---
-Urban evasion: We don't want to be chased as a bloodlust game is a 100% win for the killer. Urban evasion will save you most of the time by some situation that the killer will spot you.
---
-(optimal if you don't know which killer is) Spine chills &lt;instead of iron will&gt;: This perk counters every stealthy killers other than myers. It also tell you that the killer is gonna check your gen and they are 32m away.
---
As offering bring any map that is either big or with more pallets that usual. A good example of big map is the swap or the temple of purgation and for pallets we have shelter woods or any autohaven.
---
Absolutely adopt a stealthy playstyle. If you're being too aggro you will be sacrificed for sure.
---
ohhh my god fucking yes. That shit ticks me right off.

 Ripley wouldent work because she won't take none of the entity's shit

Calm your tits down, now answer me, who likes 2 minutes games, because thats how much a game lasts with a SWF who has a mindset to do gen as fast as possible so they can get their pip (also my flair is the fucking Trapper, of course I know he's bottom)

If they were actually tbagging cause of the blood warden, they would have nodded and clicked at the blood warden, rather than tbagged and click at OP.
---
Woah, I never knew there was a real system to this. I genuinely thought the perk arrangement was randomised when you're in a trial.
---
I'm honestly thinking about being a Nancy main since everyone else is gonna be playing others haha
---
I think this only happens if you let go of your attack button, I’m not sure though,
---
Personally, I like Wraith better than Translucent

Why do I feel like a  brazzers logo wouldn't be out of place on this picture

The devs said that they would not want to ruin the experience for players that don’t want voice chat.

You don't need to apologize about NOED. It's just a perk
---
Both posting screenshots with users names and posting screenshots of unfair matchmaking are against the rules

Objection. I hated her day one. So did a lot of survivors with many hours in the game. Killer mains didn't really talk about hating her but yeah it seems like that started recently as well.
---
Honestly, isn’t every holiday a good excuse to get drunk? At least on Halloween I can be drunk as Michael Myers!
---
Yes and stress can be caused by the most silly of things. So by all means let the guy have the time we wants to take
---
Good job on a 3k against double needle, that shit sucks.
---
Dude looking like the end of Total Recall
---
Very True........
---
They are at rank 16, level 16 for their player level, obviously not much experience yet.
---
Are you saying it's a valid reason to be toxic to low rank killers, because they are bored of the game?
---
if anyone is pressed here it's you... and just finishing gens then leaving will not get you any pips. but that's another story.
---
did you miss the part where i said gens should take longer? doing gens is the only objective survivors have. of course they want to get them done fast... it's their job.
---
and again, games wouldn't last 2 minutes if you knew how to pressure.
---
I do not
---
I stopped playing this game awhile ago because of how toxic it was. I came back maybe a month ago and it's only getting worse. I think I have to uninstall game. It's not worth it anymore.
---
And they free!
---
God Damnit.
---
Never said it was okay, just explaining the logic
---
gg
---
There are 4 survivors, counting the map, possible loops and the survivors perks and yours a gen can last a lot, and good survivors spread out on gens, how do you apply pressure?
---
I’m going to be a Nancy MAIN don’t u dare say that.
---
Yet still time for T banging for 20 years
---
Ping is the connection between players. The higher the ping the worse the connection.
---
I’m going to level up Steve first for sure
---
That’s not how grabs works.  Grabs will only happen IF you only press the button rather than holding it.  If you hold the button it’ll end up doing a lunge attack.
---
The playerbase as you call it is not just you. Many people, including myself, are actually happy with what's happening, despite how you act. I'd rather have the devs take time to do something good than rushing it making it awful.
---
It's valkyrie from rainbow six siege. xD
---
Dang you did it first
---
*whispers* darn...
---
I generally dislike people with ttv in their name because my experience with them as a soloqueue survivor is that I end up being sandbagged by them and their friends.
---
Thank you for the info.
---
*Shut the fuck up*— When do you say that?? 
---
As for me — 
---
“You fucking potato.”
---
“What are you DOING??!”
---
“Hurry the fuck up I’m dying”
---
“Dumb bitch”
---
“What even”
---
“Nooooooo”
---
“Oh, I’m dead.”
---
Nope, it has been this way for a while and is to help prevent getting farmed.
---
Oh yeah. That's true. There are the survivors that just Crouch walk around the map waiting for the killer to leave for the other survivors to die. Very frustrating when I play killer and that happens. Especially since dead by daylight is a game where time is money.
---
THOT BE GONE
---
Probably wraith because he’s just a spooky M1 killer
---
Legion and clown are two of my favorites, legion got nerfed into the ground but some people play them but on the other hand we have clown who is probably the least played killer in the game. Clown can't get around the map quick enough to apply pressure to gens and sometimes using his bottles can just disadvantage you sadly.
---
Clearly you cant handle my genius way of critique. Grow up child.
---
Funnily enough those are the ones who disconnect first if the killer finds them within a minute or they go down first.
---
Why not main Quentin when you can S E E T H E D O O R S

No. It’s not that bad

Oh no the survivors escaped you for once, how terrible. You are acting like it's the end of the world. Give them the win and move on

I watch Fungoose and he is absolutely the best out there at explaining things.

Kid your critique is the equivalent of a gas station urinal, so get out or produce some art better then his, because the door is right up there in the top left corner and your welcome to use it any time

I agree with the first comment. It may be time to play something else. I feel the same way as well, but I'm glad I'm actually looking into different games. (Like RPGs)
---
Did you download borderlands from plus? I just started that today out of curiosity. Monster world hunter has got my attention as well. 
---
It's good to try something new.
---
how can you forget what game you play so easily
---
Nancy for sure. I’ll def level Steve though. This is the first chapter were I’m more hyped for survivors then the killer. The demogorgon powers just are ehh to me
---
Wednesday can't come any sooner
---
I mean most of the other killers are just people who were given powers by the Entity. Freddy was already a whole-ass fuckin demon before being taken.
---
I never DC, but when I do its bc my internet sucks

My favorite killer, do her justice my bretha

k go preach that to everyone. meanwhile im here having fun lolol

what is sad is witnessing you trying to communicate without managing to be funny nor clever.

It doesn't matter wht rank somebody uses it at either way. It's just a perk and people can use whatever perk they want.
---
They are op and ebony moris are op. They can both be nerfed. Keys should take a certain amount of time to open a lock, not be instant. Ebony Moris should require 2 hooks.

Don’t spread false information. He’s fine.

It kinda bothers me that everyone is right-handed by default. Even more irksome on how in the main menu screen all the killers by default are holding their weapons with their left hand.
---
Posting screenshots with usernames is only unfair the rules if it's to name shame them I'm pretty sure. (ex: they were toxic or facecamped you in a match)
---
Simple tips: 
---
* Don't hoard your traps - they're useless after the last generator is activated.
---
* The trap timer only starts when a generator is completed - which is why they're useless after the last gen pops.
---
* Trap timer is slowed if the survivor is near you.
---
* Survivors sometimes think you'll ignore them if they have a trap on - don't. If they're fool enough to come back to you, smack them again and put them on the hook.
---
* Traps are for giving survivors something to do other than cleansing totems and rushing gens.
---
* When looping, you can crouch in the pallet space and use Ambush to catch a survivor on most loops - if they haven't decided to run away from you. Particularly cocky survivors may even choose to run at you and slam the pallet on your head, so if you're doing this you better be sure you're going into Ambush and not just crouching to give your legs a rest.
---
* Whispers will tell you when it's time to crouch - but remember that you can always uncrouch and go for a grab rather than blasting in with Ambush. Grabs are a lot easier if you have Monitor and Abuse with Whispers (walk normally until Whispers activates, then crouch and scuttle up to the gen).
---
* You really need a slowdown perk to buy you time to generate momentum - Hex: Ruin is your friend.
---
* Do not rely on Skill Checks - in particular, don't increase the chance for Skill Checks unless you have an ironclad build for *significantly* increasing their difficulty.
---
* If you want to pop heads, Tampered Timer and Crate of Gears (or possibly Rules Set No. 2).
---
* Probably the most well-known Pig main is [Scorpionz](https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz). I'd really recommend you watch some of their gameplay so that you can get a solid handle on Pig mindgames.
---
Pretty sure that coveres the beginner information, everything after that is just experience. Good luck!
---
I’m going to level up Nancy for her perks, but then I’m going to main Steve.
---
This is more common than you think.
---
I can't tell if you're meming or you genuinely don't know who Quentin Tarantino is
---
I'm going to call bullshit.
---
Your entire rant doesn't refute my point at all.
---
I did not *say* all streamers were toxic, I said "more often"; as in streamers tend to be more toxic than your average player.
---
You're essentially straw manning my argument, assigning values and attributes to it that do not exist.
---
*And that makes your entire point bullshit.*
---
Where?
---
Hate it. Sometimes it doesn't register the hit too when a gen is popping making it extra salty.
---
I've scared myself before with this. Finished hooking one of the survivors and turned around to get me some more hatches. I open it and BOOM there's a Feng Min in there.
---
^^^Issa ^^^meme
---
1: When trying to save an ally, time it so that you start the flashlight when they're at the killer's shoulders.
---
If you want to pallet blind, do it when they start the breaking animation.
---
2: Depends on the flashlight. But battery/battery and battery/low amp are the best. Odd bulb sucks.
---
3: You aim at their eyes.
---
&gt; Imagine if killer had the ability to just kill your entire team just because he got to near the end of the match
---
You mean noed?
---
Even if you don't stream just put TTV in your name for an added challenge, the devs finally added hard mode!
---
bites the dust
---
Well I'm used to seeing three or four Adrenalines, I don't generally see more than two Decisive Strikes even in a SWF (some of them tend to swap out DS for things like Borrowed Time depending on what they're trying to achieve).
---
I was using a bit of hyperbole, but yes four-man DS squads are incredibly frustrating when they happen.
---
Take your medication Roman
---
I think on mobile you can’t filter out stuff, but on the computer you can choose filters on the front page
---
Only 0.26% have it so how common can it be
---
New to using steam. You can leave feedback on others profiles 🤯. How do you do that?
---
I have this. Surprised it's such a low number
---
If the swf host is the 10 or 15, they are smurfing.
---
It's as the saying goes:
---
"When you curse someone, dig two graves."
---
One for them, and one for yourself. Although in this case, its more like digging a grave for yourself, and throwing a some dirt at the killer player
---
Your absolutely brain dead. What makes you think it’s a good idea to criticize someone on what they enjoy. Your such a worthless piece of filth. You clearly don’t know the difference between constructive criticism and making fun of someone’s art and what they enjoy. Get out rn you little loser. Piss off
---
Yep. I think bhvr opted for more 'interesting' matches rather a tame and balanced experience. With killer addons, survivors can go '&lt;insert_addon || offering&gt; is bullshit'. The same way for survivor items addons such as the key

The only reason I picked up Spirit is because I got tired of getting BM’d as the other killer cast. I stopped playing Nurse and I dislike billy but the BM survivors constantly gave me as Wraith Legion or Plague was just frustrating. I picked up Spirit and suddenly people don’t have the time to taunt because I’m actually winning in chases with a power that helps me.
---
Backstory?
---
Hey what's up with that? I'm also on PS4 and the moment I got to rank 4 I got two games against yellow and green ranks.
---
Thats what I plan to do for sure!
---
“That’s a lot of damage!”
---
I'm aware of how long it's been in the game and what it's for. Her feet were on the ground she should have been down. I've seen people take 3 steps and still have the immunity.
---
I like this meme. Spider man 3 is great
---
I've seen ranks 8-20 miss normal skill checks. I honestly can't tell of they just mess up a great or if they genuinely can't hit a normal skillcheck. Either way it's way too common for people to just give up and hide.
---
XD
---
For survivor, for best results it's about getting to the key perks as soon as possible. Personally I'd stick with one survivor until you have the desired teachable and *then* start on the next survivor teachable - this way there's a sporting chance that you'll get those first teachables on your second survivor, making life easier. You repeat this until you have all the desired teachables - this means that any new survivor you start from that point will have a chance at *all* of your desired teachables, and cheaply.
---
For killers, I'd suggest you get Leatherface and prioritise unlocking Barbecue &amp; Chilli. It's a good tracking perk *and* the best BP perk for killers. From there you need to choose your best killer, get Barbecue on them, and then farm BP on them to just buy your way through the Bloodwebs of the killers with the perks you're after. With killers all being different, there's really no reliable "meta" choice outside of Hex: Ruin.
---
If you spread the BP around then you can end up with a lot of L40 or L50 survivors and killers with *none* of your desired perks. Make a plan and stick to it - unlock your key teachables and *then* level your desired "main".
---
What's the connection between wraith and farming? Noob here
---
Teabagging after a failed skillcheck usually means "I'm sorry!"
---
\*Looks at "I CLEANSED THE TOTEM, BUT IT WAS HAUNTED GROUNDS INSTEAD, OH NOES" posts\*
---
Yea balancing a game is difficult, but, like, that’s what they do. That’s the goal. They have people whose whole job is dealing with stuff like that.
---
God Rick Grimes would be so fucking cool.
---
I never paid attention to it but just realized I keep mine in the right slot
---
They should just outright make a Survivor who's focused around fucking team. Give them a Dead Hardesque ability that just trips the guu next to you.
---
Can y’all stop posting these, the mods have asked y’all already.
---
I lost my rank just by looking at this meme
---
Player rank doesn't enter into it - abuse is abuse.
---
Console messages are external to the game, so while you can certainly use the in-game reporting tool you'll also want to use the Microsoft reporting tool for abusive messages.
---
Likewise, if you'd been on PS4 then you'd also want to use Sony's reporting tool in addition to the in-game options.
---
Side note they were all running no mother and petrified oaks so anytime I tried to hook they dropped them
---
My commentary consists mainly of:
---
Fuck balls.   
---
Fucking lag. 
---
Fucking punk ass camping dick hole.  
---
Fuck THIS.   
---
Can someone do a fucking gen?
---
Why the fuck do I even try? 
---
Talking to my character: RUN FUCKING FASTER.
---
Aww, is baby mad? Want a bottle? Hush little baby.😂
---
Deciding to save or to leave depends on how I was treated that game. If I'm on death hook or if I spent the whole game doing gens and risking my ass for other people, I'm not taking chances. Though usually I'm the guy still on first hook who has to go help.
---
Nah I’m good
---
This happened to me three times today I kept getting left all alone because my team kept leaving but to be fair I had a killer disconnect because I 360'd him
---
If it was swf they can join the rank 11 and play around that rank

That's not what smurfing is, the rank 10/15 person could very well legitimately be that rank and they are just playing with their friends

I think you mean ebony for him and his swf

Your a loser. Get out. People like you deserve to rot. Just leave, clearly no one wants you here you shit. Bye bye buddy. 😂

If you dont break all the totems your bad.
---
Tucker and Dale is one of the best horror movies ever! I just read that they are working on another project related to it. Can't wait. Glad to see them here, and surprised this is the first I've seen of them on this sub.
---
I know how they did it but it’s still annoying
---
And repair left-handed. That puppet’s got waaaaay too much grease and oil on it to be *that* clean.
---
If you play dbd you’re bad
---
No. No ed is different. You have to chase and hit them as well as hook them and then they'd have to die on hook. Not the same as just killing them outright.
---
Finally an argument i can get behind.
---
Adept comes by chance. Spent all day trying to get adept freddy. Had two merciless with my normal setup but got brutal killer when going adept...
---
This achievement did not exist before Bills inclusion.
---
You only get the vacuum noise warning if she starts phasing when you're outside her terror radius.  If she starts phasing while you are inside the radius, there's no warning noise.
---
Because it's the dbd subreddit dumbass
---
Yes let’s avoid the subject and compare karma. Just because you have more karma doesn’t mean your a better person
---
TBH even though I find TTV usernames shameless I don't treat them any different from other players. At most I'll equip the "ha ha funny (green) mori" for them or do the "ha ha funny camp" (IE hook them and then nod at them a bit before leaving them) just for giggles. But I don't tunnel them nor do I seriously camp them.
---
Only thing I know about Ochido is he's a pedo/creep fuck that guy
---
You can?? How?? I have never noticed any way to do that. I generally just leave if ppl start in.
---
I HATE playing against spirit as a survivor main, but she is always my go to for killer
---
Level Demigorgon to 40 for his teachables, then go for his adept. 
---
Level Steve to 40 then Nancy for their teachables and do their adept trophies. 
---
Continue to use Ace and not Nancy or Steve. Can’t just abandon my main for a shiny new character when they all effectively play the same anyways so no real point to switch over. Probably never use Demigorgon because his tunnel ability looks like it does that weird blur on the edges of the screen that Nurses blink does that gives me motion sickness if they change that or it doesn’t bother me I’ll P3 it and see how it feels playing in red ranks to see if it’s viable enough for my playstyle to make it into my “team” of preferred to play killers.
---
My fear with dedicated serves is actually there being a worse average ping, if it’s anything like the first dedicated servers ptb then I’m spooked

New Survivor: Erica Sinclair.
---
Perks

No Filter: Anytime the killer goes to hit you, you yell something offencive, yet true at them and they are forced to retreat. 
---
"I'M TEN YOU BALD BASTARD!" - Erica Sinclair
---
Avid Learner: While using this perk, you learn EVERY teachable from every survivor AND killer.
---
"Holy shit. You're a nerd!" - Dustin Henderson
---
For America!: By hitting the activate button, you can kill all the killers, and have a 99% chance of killing the Entity and 100% chance to set free every survivor.
---
"You can't spell America without Erica." - Erica Sinclair
---
far out, it looked good on its trailers. thanks for the info, still super shit though
---
So I started imagining this concept at work after the Stranger Things announcement. I had wanted the Xenomorph in the game for a minute, but thought it unlikely. Even with the Stranger Things killer I still think it unlikely, but now I can get my hopes up and not be completely crazy. The concept leans more on content from Aliens than it does Alien, which is unfortunate as the first one is much more horror-based, but I felt the sequel gave me more to work with. I also tried to address the two complaints I see here most often (tunneling and face-camping) without it feeling like I was penalizing the killer.
---
Just to think this is all because of me. I am truly fulfilled 🤣🤣
---
Alot better than you OOH BURNED😎
---
Bad matchmaking, devs said they're aware of this issue.
---
why are u fking a lamb ?
---
Trash
---
I don't just tunnel down the same person all match, but if i'm 10 feet from an injured survivor who's dead on hook, i'm not going to ignore them for the 5 foot away uninjured survivor who hasn't been hooked yet. why should it?
---
The problem is people will remember the bad matches with streamers over most others specifically because of their name. It's not that streamers are more toxic, it's just that they're easier to remember. It creates a scapegoat of "oh well this happened because they're a streamer", when most of the time a non streamer would have done the same thing.
---
Ultimately everyone just needs to focus more on enjoying the game and being kind to each other. With the new wave of people coming in with the Stranger Things DLC we need to be showing them how good the game can be. That's down to both streamers and non-stremers to do.
---
Anime pfp people are innocent, I tell you!
---
if you agree you're bad
---
thank you
---
Just like you have to run around the map trying to find the hatch. Stop bitching ffs
---
Who would win in a trial?  4 survivors each with 2-3 meta perks each and 2 of them with a significant rank advantage?  Or a single perk shocky boy?  The answer may..shock you.
---
You should chose not to do that ONLY because its not a good strategy. not because it is "ethically wrong". And i said that was when i was first shown the game. literally my first killer match. calm down fucko
---
They better fix it before they release the Stranger Things chapter, or the player retention is not gonna be great.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
If I'm completely new should I start playing now or start playing when the new DLC releases so I can awkwardly blend in with the stranger things crowd and play with people my skill level?
---
Hence why DCing should be more harshly punished.
---
Oh I loved it, I was waiting for it since 2014, and it was great the first few days until Devs stopped giving a single fuck about the game after the initial sales window. Promises of new maps and new killers stayed empty for a month, and theyve remained empty in the I months since I quit playing it. It had so much potential, but a small and greedy team that burned it to the ground for the insurance money
---
You're a madman, a disgrace to order, rule of law, and a harbinger of fear and anguish.
---
A compounding issue is how broken matchmaking is right now, especially vs. a SWF team.  I started playing this game less than a month ago (killer only) and am now a Rank 14.  I just finished a game against a team of Ranks 2, 9, 12, and 16.  I'm assuming it was SWF, which is bullshit, because SWF is already significantly harder than a normal team.  I somehow 4K'd them, but the Rank 2 was trying to do everything in his power to save the Rank 16 at the end of the game and could have just left.
---
“They might have noed!” Even though you’ve done all the tOtEmS.
---
killer queues are much worse now. yellow and green ranks used to find a game within 5 minutes. it now takes 10-12
---
Shocky boi? Lol it was a plag. But nah more like 3 survivors with 2-3 meta perks vs a single perk killer and a backstabbing cunt
---
That's reportedly one of the fixes coming with the update.
---
I mean, idk man, I just did a play off the the *happiness noise* meme, it's not an actual representation of ghostface lol. Honestly anytime someone says they don't like scary movies in the movies he just kills them soo..
---
Such wonderful characters! I wish we got more of them in this game. If Frank West were added as a Survivor I'd be so happy!
---
Mori is way worse than keys imo
---
I want a left handed killer too
---
Ahh my bad, I haven’t played either in awhile and the power icon made me honk it was an electrical shock thing from Doctor.  But I do understand the feeling trust me, just trying to make a joke.
---
I like this idea, might need a tweak here or there, but i really like it!
---
This is very impressive and amazing well stylized! I wish I could get this as a profile background on Steam!
---
Lol yea that's understandable. But nah, ik u were just tweaking the joke a lil bit
---
Yeah that's why I said I cant really comment on killer queues, dont play that enough to have valid data/info on it
---
*Killer camps or tunnels me
---
“What the fuck did I do to hurt your feelings you twat?”
---
Also people who derank and then tell new players to kill themselves. Deranking should honestly be bannable.

Leon and Claire is a no from me, I love them but keep them in RE
---
Hopefully they'll fix it with the new chapter.

Wait for all this to blow over: For each 40 seconds inside the terror radius and remaining undetected, gain a token. Whenever an altruistic action is started, use a token to complete it instantly.
---
The Winchester: Places of familiarity keep you safe, whenever inside a building, if the killer would normally see your aura, they will not.

You've got red on you: Whilst injured, gain a 5% movement speed boost but become slightly louder

Fucking harsh, but true.

Had a Jane feed a Myers the other day, she looped him for not even 10 seconds, then just stood at the other side of a window pointing at him.
---
He was a fucking infinite tier 3 Myers, long story short, he killed everyone and I got hatch
---
As someone that used to be a killer main... I hate to shatter your dreams, but I never really cared.
---
"I'm not stupid enough to fall for this loop."
---
"Two gens popped while I was chasing that guy."
---
"Why didn't that hit?!"
---
"Oh fucking flashlight camping."
---
"You're next."
---
"I hate these people."
---
"Fuck this game."
---
"Glad you stopped to taunt me in the exit like a loser."
---
"Fuck you Entity."
---
When you vault a window but lag makes you enter a lock in a chase
---
Gotta slow the game down

Check out Demons (1985), an Italian Gore-fest, with one of the COOLEST Mo-Fo's in cinema... Well worth 90mins of your time! :)

Thank you, i appreciate someone reading them!
---
Last one was Dredd 3D wasn’t it? If so,
---
We gotta wait for 4D
---
I see a lot of people recommending certain perks or perk setups to deal with specific killers, but I don’t really understand how one is supposed to know before loading in what to run since you can’t see what killer you’re up against. Do you just run generally good perks until high ranks when you’re more likely to run into nurses and spirits constantly or something?
---
I've done that exact thing. Said I tunneled just because I hooked him twice at the start. I had hooked about before I hooked him his final time. Got a 12h, 4k match on that one.
---
Very true
---
Lmfao who is the wah wah bitch? Nurse?
---
Nea changed to Dwight like 5 seconds after I said that.
---
Yeah well, it's hard for people to get started on twitch cause well....ya know, a lot of twitch traffic goes to unoriginal females who....got lucky. I don't blame them for putting twitch in their name, getting started on YouTube and twitch is challenging in this climate
---
im not one to dc but i can't say i blame you
---
Wow a plague, this might be the most rare thing I have ever witnessed in my entire life
---
She slams open the locker door and he's just holding out a hatchet
---
Honestly just increase the rarity, it's only a freaking purple add-on and it's too tier
---
&gt; Your entire rant doesn't refute my point at all.
---
You know what, you’re right, because aside from apparently threats to find you and harm you irl in the *first* paragraph (literally, raise hell with Twitch, they won’t tolerate that shit and ban the streamer, I promise), your second paragraph talks about a sabo **squad**, and the fourth talks about **four man stacking of perks and items**.  It’s almost like you’re complaining about *Survive with Friends* and not the average streamer. 🤔
---
I can’t make you follow my advice, but you need to let some of the anger go. At the end of the day, it’s just a game. If you find yourself getting legitimately angry, like it actually comes off in your posts, you need to take a step back and reevaluate your view on things. The entire point is to have fun, and if certain perks or items or killers or whatever makes you angry to the point that you’re going to use it as an excuse to act in a toxic manner, then maybe DBD isn’t the game for you. Maybe taking a break would be a healthy idea.
---
I'm thinking they meant that it is the spots where a pallet could spawn but Freddy out one there himself.
---
I mean, a lot of this sub seems pretty adamant that spirit is broken, but i totally disagree. There's plenty of counter play and ways to lose her and therefore make her waste time. but people just hug walls, try to loop her, wait at pallets, and go predictable routes, or just straight up run the entire time. If you get to know her as a survivor, and practice, it's very fun because it's not your standard loop, pallet, route, repeat
---
Yeah. Theirs not very much of us wraith mains
---
My life
---
This is his twitter post regarding his break.
---
https://twitter.com/HybridPanda/status/1166352784771428353?s=09
---
Awwhhhhhhh! That's hot!
---
One got away
---
I get DC's whenever I loop the killer for just 3 pallets lmfao
---
Is the new content free?
---
BTW can I only get offerings to play license killers or can I get offerings for other killers like Spirit and Plague cause I only have license Killers offerings
---
I think
---
Noed is prevented by not reaching the endgame as well
---
Steve, fam. Demo looks cool too but Steve comes first.
---
Well, only for the Ptb
---
Wraith wasn't all bad either, he just lost it after finding out how many people he unknowingly killed.
---
What’s funny is there is porn of dbd for some reason don’t ask me
---
A good map with too many pallets in bad spots is Gideon Meat Plant. I had a troll there who ended up escaping because I was being cocky
---
Free? If by free you mean the public test build will be free for PC players to take part in tomorrow then yes. 
---
It’s going to be a $12-$15 pack IIRC.
---
I had a game where my other three teammates disconnected but coincidentally the hatch popped up the next place I looked, always stick to it no matter how bleak things look!
---
I'm gonna be honest I'm trash at this game but Im happy whit that 3k :)
---
Tunneling is trash, If you cant play the game without camping or tunneling you should uninstall.
---
&gt; The Magnificent Seven
---
Who's that? Not trying to name and shame but the only "Famous" or recognizable players I know are Entity's Left Hand, Monto, Noob3, etc.
---
First and foremost you need to use your ears - get real comfortable with knowing how loud breathing is, what vaults sound like, what gens sound like when they're being worked on.
---
After your ears, your eyes - survivors still cause grass, corn, etc. to move around as they walk through it.
---
Distressing and Whispers can be handy starting out - if a survivor is in your Terror Radius, they don't hear your Phasing sound. Use Whispers (32m) to find a survivor, move a little closer (Distressing TR 30.24m), then Phase and go for the hit. As you get better with her you'll not need to "surprise" survivors as much - Sloppy Butcher will become more important because you'll be absolutely keyed-in on the sound of injured survivors, and it won't matter if they hear you coming.
---
Remember that if you bump into something invisible blocking you, it's probably a survivor.
---
My favorite Nea cosmetics. :]
---
It looks fantastic.

Yo, Angelo

Reminder for your reminder, demogorgon nancy and steve are Wednesday. Tuesday is dedicated servers and the bloodweb changes on the ptb
