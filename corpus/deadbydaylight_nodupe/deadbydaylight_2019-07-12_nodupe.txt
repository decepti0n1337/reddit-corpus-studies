even if the bonus made you pick up the item instantly it would still save you like less than a second in terms of total match time.
---
---
---
Do you realize devs announced adding in points for surviving certain amounts of time? This is obviously a change made to balance bloodpoints for survivors but the part of adding more events is yet to come
---
Me: *Writes ‚ÄúFranklin‚Äôs Demise‚Äù on a sheet of paper and tapes to sledgehammer.*
---
Fuck that. I hate it when my mouse is too sensitive~
---
even then, get perks
---
nope.avi
---
The question is, which one?
---
One thing that always confused me is when the hatch spawns in killer shack when basement is there.  Like..I‚Äôm just gonna hit the floor in the basement?..
---
I find it odd their complaining in my opinion survivors have the better perks lmao

You are being obtuse if you think I was suggesting someone would sit there and play 7 hours of games straight just to farm 2k shards. For a significant portion of players who have bought the game and have no intention of spending more than the base \~20 dollars, shards are their only means of getting new characters, unlocking cosmetics, and unlocking the perks of licensed characters who can't be bought with shards.  
---
I'm not saying 2k shards are worth 7 hours of anyone's time. I'm saying that amassing 2k shards TAKES 7 hours of in game play. If one character is 5 bucks or 9k shards then 2k shards is worth about a $1.25.  
---
The point remains that buying BP is almost an absolute waste of shards.  
---
"Grats on all your maths and numbers" I didn't think your point of contention would be me backing up my argument with actual facts.  
---
My main point still stands: "Anyone trading shards for BP either has everyone and everything already unlocked and then has shards on top of that, or they are effectively wasting 6.5 hours of their own time."
---
actually, you might think tbose scenese were edited like that for a reason, but it was really because of their low budget making the film.
---
:(

Sure maybe Jane is viewed by the community as dummy thicc but truly Jeff is ‰πá‰πÇ„ÑíÂ∞∫ÂçÇ „ÑíÂçÑ‰∏®ÂåöÂåö. Plus Jeff has better perks, and is just generally the man.
---
I dont even use addons on nurse lol. Messes with blinks too much.
---
When no more pools are available, I believe they all reset and the Plague gets Corrupt Purge automatically if I remember right.
---
The pools reset once all are filled.
---
If all the pools are gorrupted, every pool become non-corrupted
---
You are more dense than a bucket of lead dude. I was describing you. I have nothing to admit to. 
---
This was fun, hit me up when you have some more bottled up rage and frustration that you want to take out on a complete strange. Like the next time you just can‚Äôt get that jar of pickles open or when you can‚Äôt quite reach the birthday cake flavored ice cream that your parents put in the back of the freezer, I‚Äôm always hear if you need to vent üôÉ
---
I need them nurse skins
---
Had this same thing happen to me a few days ago.
---
It‚Äôs just really bad luck.
---
Aint that a bitch.
---
Amazing
---
I‚Äôm actually not shit at the game but thanks anyway, and I can name multiple games that are absolutely not pay to win because the only things you can buy with money is cosmetics.
---
Lol wasn‚Äôt dense just saw you wanted to admit you had no argument, thanks for admitting your argument was bunk to start with and that you‚Äôre just bad, have fun trying to climb the ranks with that 0 knowledge of counterplay ;) such a poor argument easily deconstructed and debunked lol
---
Same here ü§¨
---
You have to get a 4k with(i believe) a majority bloodpoints possible earned.
---
Bro that Kate died
---
It would be nice and this has been brought up a few times on here but falls upon deaf ears over at BhVR Interactive. Would like to see a dev post back on this thread but we know that won‚Äôt happen!
---
What's a p3 claudette? Sorry I'm a noob lol
---
Just hanging with the boys
---
What an actual cunt, why would anyone ever do tha- Oh there's a cat so fluffy I love it.
---
This hurts my eyes so bad. It looks like a bad copy of a bad 70‚Äôs aesthetic.
---
Can confirm me and my friends are just like "its too quiet" "bout to prestige which items should i use" " is hag and she has ruin"
---
Derank to rank 15, wait for rank reset, derank to 20. 
---
Lower ranks you are, the more lenient the requirements for a double pip. You can get a 4K with 5 gens left and only safety or single pip because survivors suicided on hook, or you used insta-downs and thus didn't hit enough, chases too long or too short, etc. 
---
Stupid as hell but blame BHVR. Survivors only have to escape to get their adepts so they can sit in a locker, let everyone else, die, grab hatch, "GGEZ BABY KILLER" and get their achievement while you can work your butt off and not get it because of a DC or because of some arbitrary bullshit like a gen got completed too fast since you didn't have ruin to slow the game down just a lil bit, etc.
---
Shhh don‚Äôt spoil the moment
---
Yeah but his name isnt even on this so dont give him free publicity you 4head
---
I usually get 75k playing as Leatherface with wreaths or bloody party streamers/pudding and BBQ.
---
Who cares?
---
No, not at all.
---
Not sure if disingenuous, ignorant towards dogwhistles or just didn't do enough research, but either way saying he's not a nazi or at least racist is just false.

---
These are just things he posted under stonetoss that i could be bothered to find (took me like 5 minutes), if you look into red panels, which is what the artist drew before the stone toss comics, they're even more blatantly racist.
---
It's because they released a new Killer without a new Survivor.
---
Though I don't get the rush to play new Survivors. They're just skins of the same character.
---
Yes
---
how on ps4?
---
me :)
---
glad you have something to occupy yourself üëç
---
Which would still not make sense, because Dwight never had the capability to kill someone, nor has he ever killed someone. The entity can‚Äôt make someone a killer who hasn‚Äôt done evil, its to be able to grasp upon the real world more
---
I usually use DH to dash straight into the killer when they go for the ‚Äúwhat is this mans doing‚Äù swing and run past them just to meme but I personally like to use balanced landing because it opens up a lot of the map that usually destroys your ankles
---
WHEN TRYHARD SURVIVORS SAY THAT NURSE TAKES NO SKILLS AFTER KILLING THEM
---
Watching gameplay helps a ton. As long as your general game mechanics are decent, you can basically become a midrank player just by learning how it's supposed to be played, and then a little practice.
---
[Disclosure] This is a stolen meme!! 
---
This meme is not mine I thought it was funny and reminded me of dead by daylight üòÇ
---
Really? It‚Äôs only ever appeared in the killer shack without the basement for me, so I never knew
---
I have done that to teabaggers, i don't care if i "lose" in the end, as long as I deprive the teabgger of points/fun.
---
now i don't know if this guy was a teabagger but something happened.
---
*wehh*
---
I‚Äôve only seen it 2-3 times and I always assumed it couldn‚Äôt spawn above basement until I saw it myself
---
I just equip a mori. Does the trick well
---
Yeah I assumed that too
---
I checked this out a few days ago- the Trapper was renamed to Jason.
---
Fucking Jason.
---
Just... how have they gotten away with any of this?
---
The thing is you can't do that with all killers, some are meant to do that like mirror Myers and wraith but if you play most other killers you need to search and Chase to be effective because of your terror radius and red stain
---
Now this is a better comment.
---
I'm not a good person; I'm just stubborn.
---
What is slug?
---
It is definitely the most fun though
---
Downing everyone in the game until they all die from bleedout timers
---
Yeah, but with killers like huntress and Freddy the music can spook too.
---
Garbage change that would make little sense. If they‚Äôre going to change the Doc to make him more viable they should make his existing kit more effective. Illusionary Doctors should run at survivors and have a red stain. Skillchecks should become more difficult while in Tier 2 and 3 Madness. Shocking survivors should hinder them for a second or at best injure them if they‚Äôre shocked enough times, like the Plague‚Äôs vomit. Most of Doc‚Äôs kit gives him an unrivaled advantage in tracking and finding survivors, but his effectiveness in slowing down the game should be looked at if spending the time shocking survivors and worsening their madness is too easily snapped out of and played around/ignored, making it much less worth the time.
---
Once they nerf pallet looping a lot of M1 killers are going to have way less trouble, Doc included.
---
I just bring a Mori for those toxic twitch swfs. I swear they are all trying to be that one guy who got banned except they all have 4-9 viewers.
---
Re-sleeping people as old Freddy isn't a difficult task, particularly with range addons and/or class photo. Breaking chase is completely feasible because you have aura reading to readily reengage when you want to, since they're going to struggle to wake up at endgame. Obviously every killer is going to struggle with a 4-man adrenaline to full health at endgame, but it doesn't change that old Freddy was much stronger in that department overall.
---
I'm not wrong about door opening, Freddy had a 50% *action speed reduction*, which therefore meant the doors took twice as long to open in Dream World.
---
It's spelled in ancient Latin runes.
---
Okay thank you! üòò
---
Tolkien is rolling over in his grave at that comment
---
Teammates who heal are also wasting 16 seconds not doing generators instead of someone just using selfcare.
---
As a Myers main, I‚Äôm a very happy square
---
THIS LITERALLY JUST HAPPENED TO ME I UNHOOKED MYSELF BUT THE NEA WOULDN'T LET HERSELF DIE SO THE KILLER SAT RIGHT ON THE HATCH. IT'S LIKE MY MOM GOT ME A PUPPY AND MY DAD PUT IT DOWN WITH A SHOTGUN THE SECOND AFTER.
---
I think there a bug right now where when you queue and get three survivors a fourth won't be able to join for a while or at all. Don't know much about it but that's what I heard
---
Because I stole it from Discord, lol.
---
[removed]
---
Repost from like the 3rd from top...... ouch
---
Mine is always walk forward as killer and do a front flip as survivor
---
Wasting is a bit of a stretch. Sure you‚Äôre spending 16 seconds healing, but it‚Äôs necessary to do, plus then both of you are there to do an objective afterwards
---
We need a vampire killer  ‚Äú what a horrible night to have a curse‚Äú. 
---
Also, an ancient Pharos mummy. The entity have awoken mummy and a vampire, to search for more sacrifices. 
---
Desert ruins map, and old castle ruins map.
---
Why was that Deleted?
---
Oh, I thought you were just correcting me, but you just hate fun.
---
No, somebody could totally snap and turn Killer in an environment like that. Especially if they're offered power. Wraith SOMEHOW turned Killer after killing one guy because he was angry he was made to kill people, so I'm not putting more effort into my lore writing than the devs did.

Oh piss off I didn't say that. Reddit is so fucking full of the same boring people with their shitty political hot takes. If you want your fill of politics go to fucking r/all. Can we please have one fucking subreddit on this putrid site where the userbase can refrain from political talk, holy shit it's draining to read.
---
White Wards are garbage. Killer Add-Ons disappear 100% of the time they use them, meaning every time you use a black ward, it does its job. Black Wards are effectively 1 each of the killers best add-ons. White Wards don't do *anything* if you live, are countered by Franklin's, and are Very Rare.

i need this in my life. thicc boy is my everything. i play as "Clowns Boyfriend" this is really great work!

He just copy pasted his answer
---
Still waiting for you to make a good counter argument his lolll
---
Why would Ruin not have a totem that‚Äôs how it works. You can‚Äôt just take the totem away then it‚Äôs not hex ruin anymore. What are you going on about?
---
Not that any perk should be ‚Äúbuilt in‚Äù, but is there a point to have both? Like why do you need two guaranteed second chances after being unsafely unhooked? Seems overkill on top of an already awful idea.
---
Being tunneled is not that common of an occurrence and it is not the end of the world.
---
do the Superior version and just keep chainsawing them as leatherface
---
Where is your ruin?
---
Why?  Taking his shit and twisting it does a pretty good job of derailing the original message.  It‚Äôs better to openly mock nazis than to deny they exist.
---
imo piggy is the most fun, but billy is the least.
---
Only dumb people make dumb plays. Why would you intentionally make a dumb play?
---
I don't like 4 man's much, since many tend to be jerks. But momma didn't quitters, so if you need me I'll be in the basement crying while the P3 Dwights keep trying to flashlight me lol
---
New survivor: Sia
---
fookin scrubs
---
This is a really good idea
---
I'd prefer no one left behind to get a rework also. it's a bloodpoint perk and only activates t endgame which makes it useless for most of the match it really needs it.
---
I mean yeah, but I feel like the first one had much more going for it. The story is cool, but the later ones just feel like way over-the-top traps, and twists that just feel out of left field. 
---
YMS did a review on the series that says similar things. But to each his own.
---
Just to be clear. Only the person on the hook needs to have bt for it to work.
---
God I wish, I would love to be able to learn new killers in a casual mode instead of against the rank that I belong at with other killers.
---
Maybe ds works on the first 2 people saved? Or 3?
---
Ive verified game files and tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game to no avail
---
Only baby killers you don‚Äôt need ruin when you‚Äôre good enough at the game to not rely on it.
---
Wouldn't you just need BT in this situation?
---
Nothing else?
---
I am the same. I'll likely buy all the dlc. This game is so worth it.
---
Dude, that is totally awesome, I had forgotten about that!
---
It actually happens pretty damn often to me but I recommend playing some killer if you don't to realize how it could effect the game so much.
---
"But putting a gun to someone's head and making them pull the trigger is still murder"
---
-Detective Matthews, *Saw 2*
---
Looks almost Frankensteinian, as if the Doctor is animating the survivor.
---
Mirror Myers on Lerys.
---
I absolutely agree, it just makes it better in my eyes.
---
"I have over 24 days played in total" 
---
come back after at least 5-6 months of playing BOTH sides
---
you're still at a rank where killers are new or don't know at all what they are doing so they'll tunnel and camp most of the time, rank up to purple/red and you'll see the difference
---
Same. 
---
People get so emotionally invested in this game, it's not healthy if you look at how the game is designed. There was a great post a while back about the mental side of DBD...
---
^(*I do play by made up survivor rules because 1. i'm not shit at killer so i don't need to camp/tunnel/etc lazy tactics to apply pressure + i mostly play Nurse 2. game is more fun and challenging that way 3. way more bp*)
---
I said Decisive **OR** Borrowed time. Not sure why so many people are misreading that.
---
I want a werewolf killer tbh
---
SwF iS Op. PlZ nErF
---
Ahhhhhh
---
From my experience you can‚Äôt escape with reverse bear trap it will kill her. But maybe this was fixed in some of the updates
---
You can walk around people in this game you know, you are actually faster than the survivors so moving slightly to the left or right will get you past them.
---
Anything with my guy Herman is good.
---
Nurse mains does not use noed and most times also not ruin if they are really really good
---
Nea is confirmed the Entity
---
Most musicians are nerds
---
No. Get over it. I don't get these complaints about tunneling. Why shouldn't killers go after the weaker person?
---
Dying üòÇ
---
Given the fact they're the type of survivor to disconnect/ragequit, no, not at all.
---
Yall are some sensitive little 12 year olds..
---
I don't give a crap about BM, i just think to myself: *"Wow, it can write? Amazing!"*

FUCKING "Fun things are fun" ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
The name remover lmao your name does not check out
---
Or manhunt cosmetics
---
My best friend and I play dbd together and it's hard because I will lay down my life for baby dwights but he fucking hates them and refuses to help them in any way lol
---
Oi
---
I mean, the solution would be that each daily would have a theme or something, and would provide way to complete them as both survivor and killer.
---
i know thats why its for dank nurse mains only not the true ones
---
There was a pretty strangely convoluted Ghostface one I had gotten.
---
It was like: "Playing as the Ghost Face, mark 3 survivors while leaning from cover. Down that survivor."
---
Maybe BHVR is trying to kind of even out the Survivor and Killer daily difficulties.
---
And p3-50 is only like 1/3rd to 1/2 way of p3 50 all perks, so double or triple that amount of time, even more when you factor in many matches (especially as survivor) will earn less than 20k per match.
---
I was told I was cancer and to kill myself because grabbed someone off the door after blinking to it as nurse while it was at 99%. I dont play PC pretty much at all so this was rank 19 salt is everywhere I guess. Had a guy accuse me of tunneling because he was always at my ruin when I went back to check it. The salt is omnipresent, worship the salt.
---
&gt;white wards do nothing if you live
---
Yeah, because you get to keep your item if you life. The White Ward is just insurance.
---
&gt;Are countered by Franklin‚Äôs
---
Said this. And in some cases, it should counter it. (Such as having the last of the items charges lost)
---
&gt;are Very Rare
---
Yep. So are Black Wards.
---
Killers are the power role btw. They‚Äôre meant to have inherently better stuff than a single survivor can have. Kind of the point to an asymmetrical game.
---
Repooooost
---
That one of my favorites it looks like some strange intensive experimental treatment
---
Same! Glad you do aswell.
---
Eh. The drawing itself isn‚Äôt bad and I would like to say good job to whoever made it but I just don‚Äôt like how it looks personally
---
Someone's getting a little defensive.
---
This, but when it says "Be chased for 5 seconds as _____" 
---
I run the killer around for thirty seconds in a chase and all I get is 2s towards the daily progression.
---
Play console
---
ok?  The watermark is removed on this one so its not like we're promoting him at all.  If the comics are re-contextualized does it really matter?  All this really looks like to me is karmawhoring by stating something everyone already knows.
---
&gt; Co-Op actions are broken
---
Chase dailies are broken as well. I could have the killer staring at my ass in a chase for a minute and I'd only get 2 seconds for the daily.
---
I understand and I know you are right its just making me not want to play the game. I've dropped 3 ranks today Because every person is toxic , just now in another came my teammate camped in front of me while I was on the hook for 2 minutes teabagging and pointing at me. I'm uninstalling this game
---
how do you get above 32k x 2 unless other people also bring BPS?
---
Ironic shitposting is still shitposting. The same thing applies with racist posting.
---
I thought they were the same picture just one was after you got a few items after I looked at your player level
---
Play killer and you will see how often survivors are basically throwing themselves at you trying to unhook each other. It gets ridiculous. I‚Äôve downed like 3 people one after the other because they think they can unhook someone while you are literally standing right there. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
When they reset dies everyone go to 20 or how does it work? I just started playing 8 days ago and I‚Äôm at rank 13 just curious of where I‚Äôll end up
---
You've got to level up the person that starts with that perk to a specific level 30, 35, 40 and  that unlocks that perk in the bloodwebs of other survivors or killers
---
‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even reached the right to speak yet‚Äù. Why do you think you are speaking to someone like that? Did your mother forget to hug you ya fucking asshole I speak when I want and I‚Äôm speaking right now and you can‚Äôt do shit fucking moron.
---
funny as hell to the killer tho
---
Because your team was all BABIES who brought all these BABIES
---
I would be totally fine if they removed one chapter a year, and replaced it with a QoL dedicated update, including animations, bug fixes, cosmetic updates, that sort of thing.
---
If you level up a survivor to Level 30, 35, and 40 respectively, you can get their three teachable perks. Once you get a teachable perk, it can show up in any other survivors bloodweb randomly. You can unlock Self-Care in Claudettes Bloodweb at Level 40 and can unlock Adrenaline in Megs bloodweb at Level 40.
---
Maybe give it one last shot and play with friends. Don't got any? Ask on here or someone in game. That's how I ran into the people I play with now. Was a rank 8 survivor, asked this rank 4 guy if he wants to party up. Guy said ok and we've been good buds since.
---
The game is fun but the community makes it awful. And it doesn't help I solo que everything. But I disagree with you , every survivor is a jerk.
---
Each character has 3 character exclusive perks. They can be unlocked as teachable perks when you level that character up to levels 30, 35, and 40 and unlock it through the bloodweb. Once you have them as a teachable perk they will randomly appear on other survivors bloodweb as you level them up.
---
No ruin=gen rush. Have fun looking for p3 claudettes that blend in with everything. Did I mention their a four stack swf and they all have toolboxes with brand new parts.
---
Right next to spawn
---
I use wifi lmao. My connection is great.
---
Same. They also can't be in collision with a wall. Really annoying.
---
I'd say bhvr shouldn't touch any killer after they come out for 1 month
---
Omg are hair physics actually back?
---
Pay attention to the shrine in the store as well. Every week it‚Äôs refreshed with new perks. So, save up there iridescent shards.
---
In fairness they also released Ash without a killer, so it was *kinda* balanced out.
---
Though more people rush to play a new killer than a new survivor so...
---
Agreed
---
Huh, and here I was thinking I was just bad.
---
I still am, but now for different reasons.
---
He‚Äôll definitely be nerfed. My guess it‚Äôll be the amount of fake pallets he can place
---
Well I have a few friends but they don't play dead by daylight and I play on console. I was a rank 6 survivor earlier but now im rank 9 because of toxic matches , the sad part is the killers are doing their job well and right but its my team thats ruining the game and being toxic. I'm also to shy to ask people to play
---
The point of my post is that I don‚Äôt like the idea of giving survivors 2 of their most powerful perks for free
---
Omg. If it weren‚Äôt for you they would‚Äôve been dead
---
The Spirit one is more frustrating cause grappling someone out of phasing doesn't count. I naturally try to get people on gens with it. I grabbed much, much more than I hit.

I do play mostly killer and on Xbox I‚Äôve barely ever experience altruism like that. Not even swf are that altruistic in my experience. I‚Äôm rank 8 if that makes a difference.
---
So hes free right? Because we already have his 3 perks...
---
Same
---
The larger issue is how god awful solo queue is. It is, by far, the worst experience you can have in this game. As a killer, solo queues are a breeze to vs and SWF is an actual challenge. This game is just complicated to properly balance. 
---
Separating ranked and casual play would make the queue times for ranked insane. Most good players play with friends.
---
"They're are" mother of god...
---
Careful, though. Dropped survivors receive a 33% bonus to wiggle progression. Dropping a survivor a fourth time breaks them free.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs gonna be free. The catch is that if you don‚Äôt have his perks already on a certain character, your going to have to unlock them to unlock them on someone else
---
It‚Äôs a troll account relax.
---
As long as you hook them right after and don‚Äôt wait for the entity to kill them, do it however many times you like
---
Go check out HybridPanda on YT. He has tutorials.
---
**Paramedic**: Really hoped they would add something like this by now, hope they do one day.
---
**Blood Hero**: "Rough game but at least I can get to kill the toxic surviv-- he's t-bagging, he has the perk, I hit him he gets away for free, I don't hit him he gets away for free...fuuunnnnn..."
---
**Justice:** (Do you need to be downed once for it to work?) Either way a cool one but my friend hangman's trick would demolish it first week of  it's release.
---
**Breaker:** Honestly this one combined with paramedic would make some cool builds. But as a standalone I rather take ded'ard or Lithe thanks.
---
**Timed Wealth:** 
---
#[**FINGER GUNS**](/intensifies)
---
Ummm noed doesnt need to be on a timer... that's worse than it already is...
---
If you‚Äôre weren‚Äôt severely dyslexic you would see in my post I never said to add both perks...
---
No, that means the entity blocked them and you cant get them.
---
No, they are consumed by the entity.
---
Can you eventually unlock them?
---
No they‚Äôre taken completely. That‚Äôs the entity spawning and taking items so you can‚Äôt have everything in the bloodweb. You have to chose carefully how you do each web to get everything you want.
---
Chase the survivors for two minutes as The Nurse. 
---
Me: cries in confused PS4. 
---
Nurse: stares in confused nurse mechanics.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt read.
---
Idk why everyone gets so butt hurt about tbagging, I mean I didn't even know it was a "salty" thing until I got Reddit lol
---
You really should try to play both sides, even if is 1/4 games.
---
Nothing worse than seeing a double xp item on one side and something ultra rare on the other, then getting cock-blocked by the entity for the one you didn't go after first.
---
Doctor mains approve this
---
It‚Äôs like.  What.  Sole survivor?   Pretty much completely except for a very specific weird build.
---
Trust me you don‚Äôt need ruin even at high ranks, if you weren‚Äôt a baby killer you would know that.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt even use your brain and prove that your argument might be solid but instead you waste time trying to show that you‚Äôre better than everyone else by insulting without any sense.
---
Btw as a killer you can literally lunge and rotate your camera 360 degrees to get a 360 degree hit box of death!
---
*suddenly coldwind*
---
sorry for being done with people being like "I just downloaded the game. I played one game. I don't like something, please break the entire game for me!"
---
Play some more, get experience and start discussions once you get some grasp over anything. Think about your ideas and what they'd bring before posting.
---
Make sure you 360 right before you think the killer is going to swing. Also 360ing multiple times might help.
---
I figured the killer times were because ghost face just came out and people were trying him out because new killer
---
More like Claudette‚Äôs no matter what rank you‚Äôre at
---
Well it's not the tea bagging itself..... it's the fact survivors will stay at the exit gate and teabag and refuse to leave. Killer knows theyre beat, that's just insult to injury after which is why they more than likely made endgame the way they did.
---
Are you saying you don't want to see her beautiful feet?
---
That's be nifty, though I think it would be interesting to get Barb, considering that the Entity seems to like people who are dead or dying, and considering how she already got dragged into The Upside Down.
---
But I guess Hopper would be more immediately recognized, and he has the hat...
---
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even use your brain‚Äù shut up kid this is a discussion not an argument as you can tell by **READING** the post flair *cough,***DYSLEXIC***cough*, oh wait sorry you can‚Äôt read that correctly either.
---
So true but the only way i can see justify this is that killers NEED perks to play and survivors can do ok-ish perkless and most importantly killer bloodweb is the only way to get add ons.
---
I love as survivor when rank reset comes around and i dont need one of my builds and i can restock my inventory by going WGLF, Plunderers, Ace and prove thyself.
---
New doctor buff- Pulse rifle
---
Leveling survivor i dont mind because instead of seeing every game to its end i can die early and cash out or leave early and cash out either way im getting games done 2x faster than as killer.
---
Main the survivor you like the best.  I recommend Ash, Shirtless David, Thicc girl...in that order.  Oh and Bill from Left 4 Dead releases soon on console.  
---
Level the others to unlock the teachables you want.
---
Wow grow up man, that‚Äôs straight out of a 12 year old kid. Apparently dyslexic is the only ‚Äúcool‚Äù word you know, nice. And as discussion, there‚Äôs nothing to discuss. Shit idea
---
"iF yUo WerEn,T a BabY kIlLeR YuO wOuLd KnOW tHaT"
---
Btw 24 days in game aint shit
---
If you weren‚Äôt severely dyslexic you would see that I have 24 **DAYS** played.
---
I think 30,0003 is just about right
---
mah bad
---
Billy is Hillary
---
Shit you right. At least you understand. A better example would be the other Azarov map with the mess of loops in the middle.
---
Maybe because censoring someone's artwork and shaming them through their art just because of their (admitedly poor) political beliefs is just as bad as having those political beliefs in the first place?
---
Seriously? Holy shit I have to report this lmao
---
Youre extremely unlucky, just about everyone else gets 1 - 2 ebony mories every 2 bloodwebs.
---
That's just incorrect baby survs whining
---
i get them too, but only after like level 20. so if you don‚Äôt level up a killer to around level 20 you aren‚Äôt getting the daily
---
&gt;Also, I love how i'm either disingenuous, ignorant towards dogwhistles, or just bad at research, it's totally not possible I didn't find damning evidence of a person based on a quick glance through of the first few pages of their comics.
---
Which is why i said you didn't do enough research, not that you were bad at it.
---
It's not about shaming people for using certain formats, it's about calling out dogwhistles and subtly racist things  in order to not allow crypto fascism to fester in this community.
---
That was an obvious exaggeration. You're still in the baby zone when it comes to your playtime and this post reflects that
---
Also the right perks are mandatory as killer, even at high ranks as survivor if i can loop i dont really need perks at all.
---
Yeah, from the short trial play I did, I noticed that when you hit or hook a male character it will either play David or Dwight‚Äôs scream.
---
I'll never forget the killer who (understandably) camped the last guy,  who was hooked in the basement.  That was their only kill. 
---
Post game chat both the dead survivor and killer were mad. 
---
Survivor was mad cause they didn't get saved. I and another teammate tried, but got smacked away and I didn't have BT, anyway.  
---
Killer was mad, stating they had to camp cause "gen rush". Killer had NOED that didn't activate because all totems were cleansed. 1 person was hooked twice,  lived.  Another one was hooked once, saved before struggle,  lived.
---
Gen rush.
---
I'm sorry - is there another objective for  survivors to do that I'm missing?
---
Did you get it? You got it didnt you.
---
He got it.
---
and all of 2 perks too smh
---
Your Ruin is in a pretty good spot. Or is it?
---
Hrrrrg, survivors, I'm trying to sneak to the gens, but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass keeps alerting the killer.
---
Jane, by the way.
---
Circle, I think.
---
That's dumb... lmaooo
---
Early  days dailies were like "as wraith sacrifice 16 survivors - reward: 8000 bloodpoints" lol
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have 30 years in game and no life. 
---
24 days is a shit ton to me you guys are acting likes that‚Äôs nothing, it‚Äôs enough to understand the fundamentals of the game I don‚Äôt need 3 years playtime to have an opinion.
---
[https://twitter.com/ShannonVanPelt](https://twitter.com/ShannonVanPelt) ill just post the url then
---
Yeah. You wouldn't be able to leave the match either and would die to EGC too. Fun stuff.
---
Prestige 3. You can individually prestige with each survivor and killer

Lmfao I know ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Harder, youre forgetting about opening gates, i can camp the gates for a daily and some adrenaline meg will still quick vault my face and steal the fucking gate from me.
---
Update: as of 10:03 pm EST, I managed to get in. Hopefully it's working for all!
---
You tried killer much? If so, what didnt you like?
---
And I don‚Äôt even know how to use him first time .. couldn‚Äôt even figure out how to teleport to gens üòÇ
---
Well you‚Äôre not the first person to misread the post so it wasn‚Äôt obvious to me. And that I don‚Äôt care about because I‚Äôve actually got a life and a job and shit so you can keep your 30 years playtime.
---
The best treatment nazis deserve is to be shamed. Poor is a very light choice of words for that set of beliefs. When this person's beliefs are literally that jewish people should be murdered and an ethnostate created, exposing people(when they ask for a source, for example) to that without prior knowledge is extremely irresponsible and dangerous to the people the ideology literally threatens.
---
"As david king loot and escape with 1 item"

"As feng min loot an-"

**GOD DAMMIT**
---
No you just think I treat my items like trash when in fact I take care of my stuff, plenty of other people on here have stated the same thing happening to there keyboards and controllers! I still have a pair of sketcher shoes that look brand new from 5 years ago and I wear them every weekend and have logged some miles on them but they still look like I just pulled them out the box. I have a 2002 Ford Explorer that is in excellent condition because I take care of my shit! So don‚Äôt go being a asshole and thinking you know how someone is or treats their items!
---
Thanks. I've only been trying it as a last resort lately. It's still rare that it works.

Not really

Prestige 3 once you reach level 50 with a survivor or killer you can prestige them which resets their level and gives them a cosmetic which is just the default outfit but bloodied
---
Mans completely done with the killers shit.
---
Prestige 3, basically the highest level you can get your character to.
---
Yes of course, but it's kinda obvious when the Devs revealed Tenacity they did so without the picture as it would have revealed the chapter.
---
Or when you‚Äôve been specifically grinding for two perks and in a later web they both show up.
---
BHVR haven't released survivor banners yet (and there wouldn't be any I guess)

No :(

Even worse if they‚Äôre for the same build ughgghh.

 Number 3 looking ass
---
I just had BBQ 2 and Ruin 3 pop on my spirit the other day. Wanted to cry.
---
What are you doing with SCP-902 oh my god it‚Äôs dangerous it‚Äôs going to explode get it far away from here
---
Just because you put the word ‚Äúcool‚Äù doesn‚Äôt distract from the fact you called the word dyslexic ‚Äúcool‚Äù.
---
Swf isn't a problem, swf all communicating in a party is a problem
---
This looks like it‚Äôs not PTB
---
Yes! That would be a good example. Shit like that isn't *really* possible at all to warn anyone about.
---
**"Hey I threw a pallet in the jungle gym."**

I agree I hate them all.. always selfcaring and urbaning around in my experience. When I solo and theres 2 claudettes in a lobby I dodge..  I'm not dealing with it.
---
Does it come with toxic Claudette‚Äôs?
---
I didn‚Äôt fucking call ‚Äúdyslexic‚Äù cool you retard it was metaphorical and apparently you‚Äôre too young to even know what metaphors are
---
Well, it's at least a glimmer of hope--
---
... wait a minute...
---
Are you on console, or are you using a pad on PC? Because of you are on console, or aren't playing on the PTB, than the reason you couldn't figure out how to tp to gens is because you were playing old Freddy, who can't.
---
No, I mean like, what killer has it?
---
Oh I‚Äôm on console
---
As far as I knew there wasn't any of that, or at least I didn't see it. It's entirely possible that's what was happening, considering one of the players was tbagging around with us survivors.
---
Legion looks pretty stupid carrying around Meg lol Megs got long ass arms and legs and legion is short af it looks so funny
---
Oh, I didn't know that! Thanks, I will pass this knowledge on and keep it for later use! I appreciate it. :)
---
I played F13 a lot in late 2018 but the servers are complete ass and I just couldn‚Äôt ever find a match, then I got introduced to Dbd
---
As someone who just started a month ago, jump on in, the water's fine. Are you coming in on PS4, Xbone, or PC?
---
Why is this spoiler tagged? Jw
---
That'll be why than, you weren't playing as post rework Freddy, you were playing as per rework Freddy.
---
I 100% agree. But i don‚Äôt feel like the player on the hook should be punished for the other players bad decisions, which is why I made this post. There are many times where someone is coming to unhook me at a bad time and I want to stay in the hook but that‚Äôs not possible.
---
Or the most likely reason...
---
4) the killer is just toxic and it has nothing to do with anything the survivor did. Plenty of them exist. They just get kicks out of taunting the other side the same way toxic survivors do. No different.
---
I like to use Face mask + rules set no.2 or just running Amanda letters + last will
---
Yeah, I definitely put my sensitivity on max. I ran the game tutorial and just practiced the movement until it was second nature. It has to be my timing. I'm probably juking too late. Or maybe I need to link a few together. And I don't fake juking before I 360, so that would probably help; forcing them to swing when I want to juke instead of trying to time their attacks.
---
Yeah, I've seen plenty of my teammates be pretty damn toxic to killers.
---
One of the cool things about Borrowed Time is that you can use it make some really big plays with it that would otherwise be too risky. If you can't tell whether or not the person on the hook has BT, than that nullifies it's play making potential.
---
I actually like that idea
---
Ability: Fullmoon - The Wolf breaks into a sprint on all fours to close the gap. Lasts for 10 seconds and has a 20 second duration. Making contact with a survivor injures them for one health state. Can vault (jump) pallets and windows. 
---
Add-ons: Would add various effects to the ability and also increase duration/reduce cooldown. Maybe a very rare that allows The Wolf to instantly down a survivor
---
Perks: Caught Scent - Every 20/15/10 seconds, the aura of injured survivors is revealed to you for 3 seconds.
---
 Wolf Born - For every survivor not currently injured, gain a 3/4/5% increase to movement speed
---
(Only triggers when a survivor is injured)
---
The Howling (Hex) - Every time a survivor has been hooked, terror radius is 0. When in a chase, terror radius increase by 100% and randomly jumps between survivors. Lasts for 5/10/15 seconds.
---
Blame the emblem system then.
---
Rank 9, pretty sure they were a Rank 2
---
And do it cooperatively
---
I‚Äôve been in purple as a survivor and I‚Äôm usually low purple/high red as killer. I‚Äôm not sure how people think I‚Äôm not good/low rank because I played 24 days, that‚Äôs a lot of damn time and grinding I know everything about this game that someone who payed a year would so don‚Äôt pull that card.
---
Yeah but wouldn't it be nice if the emblem system recognized that.
---
He has the best potential, but he‚Äôll need some small buffs for him too be truly viable. Mainly in the teleport or snares. The pallets should be base and share tokens with snares, but otherwise they are fine. I really like this rework and hope they don‚Äôt butcher him because of low ranks.
---
Timing is probably the toughest part of 360s. Eventually you‚Äôll find that sweet spot of when you need to 360. Think of 360s as dead hard. If you‚Äôve ever used it you know that time when you press the button right before and the killer misses the swing. Think of 360ing as an advanced version of dead hard. It lets you take another ‚Äúhit‚Äù and create some distance.
---
This one's too advanced for Reddit m8
---
PRAISE the Clown!
---
For he let Pizza Hero go,

So good is this deed,

For I'm sure my pizza grows cold.
---
I remember when I was rank 20...
---
Seriously, every single dbd player worth their salt (both survivor and killer) agrees that the nurse is dumb and fundamentally breaks the game. OhTofu isn't a nurse main and he released a vid of him playing addonless and perkless and shredding absolutely everyone. 
---
"Against a good nurse, you just die"
---
I wonder how they feel about Hag traps by the hook.
---
The masks are iconic everyone thinks of those masks when they think of the purge, so chill the fuck out.
---
THE NEW FREDDY REWORK IS JUST

WORSE CLOWN
---
WORSE HAG
---
OR POSSIBLY BETTER DOCTOR
---
Show me the proof. I haven‚Äôt seen it yet.
---
That poor Piggy. :(
---
He has a perk called Bites The Dust, where if the killer is stunned all generators regress a tiny bit. A pretty awful recreation, but I tried!

I‚Äôm sorry for your loss if your killer.
---
Same.
---
100% achievements, so I have been Rank 1 in both roles. I pretty much live in red ranks exclusively. SWF can be hard to deal with. SOMETIMES. But most of the time, they are easy to deal with.
---
I love when two games I like cross over like this
---
BBQ
---
Love your response üòÇ i SEE yall mf's walkin around
---
20k is SUPER low balling though... I'd say I average about 50k per game as killer, when i use BBQ. Even more if I use a blood point offering.
---
Hacker confirmed
---
Do you play on console or PC?
---
Yea. One of the reasons I stopped maiming Nurse was because she gets way too easy too play after a while, and it‚Äôs just a cake walk.
---
"They hated him because he spoke the truth."
---
24 days is longer than you think, I‚Äôve got every killer perk and almost every survivor perk. My lowest killer rank was 3 and my lowest survivor rank was 5. I‚Äôve got 4 killers P2 and 2 survivors P2 the rest are mostly P1 and some are P0.

O they know
---
At that point the best option is to look for the hatch
---
The shape=the object
---
oy vey!
---
So basically you can pallet loop even longer and more often!
---
how the hell did you have so much time to do that? did someone help you how to improve or something? it's questionable for me because i started playing when the SAW chapter was released and one of my friends told me to level up Hag and Claudette since Ruin and Self Care "were" mandatory back then and it took me around 1 week to get both of them to level 50 and i think i've played around 5h a day. now i have around 900h in this game and i still need 5 killers to level up for their perks.
---
I'd destroy both tbh.
---
I‚Äôve play both sides but I haven‚Äôt seen a survivor daily in about 2 weeks.
---
The Game is just the worst, just as soon as I think I know where the hatch can spawn I see a new location I had no idea about.
---
yeah i thought about that which i why i forgot to mention you can only do it like 1-3 times im not too sure

Nurse &gt; Billy &gt;/= Spirit &gt; Hag &gt;/= Huntress &gt; Myers &gt; Ghostface &gt;/= Plague &gt; Doctor &gt; Clown &gt;/= Pig &gt; Wraith &gt; Legion &gt; Trapper &gt;/= *Freddy &gt;/= Leatherface
---
* Pre rework
---
This is why I dodge swf.
---
Yea isn't rank re-set always the 13th?
---
Submit a support ticket, rank reset hasn't happened yet that's on the 13th.
---
Maybe they'll be able to help you out.
---
Ghostface was only using his power for stealth, not to one hit down the survivor.
---
Because everyone has a different definition of what being an asshole is
---
Close your game and reload. Your rank reset will stay but you will have your perks and stuffs back.
---
When you say phasing to an unhook. Are you going far away then phasing back to the hook as the unhook happens and going straight for the unhooked survivor?
---
Yeah
---
I dont ever play like an asshole, but i love when people get super salty and tilted and start sending me hate mail. People will find any excuse to call you trash if they lost and its so entertaining tbh.
---
I just hit Devotion 10 last night. I don‚Äôt have a problem. I‚Äôm not addicted.
---
It depends on your current rank. The higher your rank (in this case higher meaning a low number so highest rank = rank 1) the more free 'pips' you're given on the 13th.
---
So if you are rank 1 before the reset, you'll end up at Rank 10 with 2 pips already.
---
If you are Rank 15, you'll wind up at Rank 17 with 1 pip. 
---
With this Ranks 20-16 generally stay a safe haven for new players. Although if you're really worried about being mismatched I would take a few days off as people re-climb and get back to the Rank 15 buffer.
---
Apparently its a boomin‚Äô
---
The first perk would be straight up busted. Skill checks can be done pretty easy after playing long enough a lot of people fail them because of itching themselves or lullaby.
---
This is fine, probably best with swf.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be able to reconstruct an entire a pallet. I think instead you build a weaker one with a different appearance. And could probably only be used up to three times before braking and make it so that the killer can break it quicker. But the time should also be reduced probably to about 10-12 seconds at its best.
---
My rank went from 4 to 12 man, unless the game fucked that up too
---
He's not saying that the Spirit is bad against average survivors, he's saying that the Hillbilly is easier for the survivors to counter but stronger if they don't.
---
Whichever one is closest to where I phase.
---
Idk man reset isnt til saturday so id get in contact with bhvr somehow
---
They cant afford to buy shit because theyre poor? As in, they dont have the money?
---
What kind of broken as perks are those stun a killer 150 percent sprint burst
---
There does not seem to be a nerfed planned for Freddy before live. A mod commented on a post about being concerned that Freddy would be nerfed before live, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry (emoji)‚Äù.
---
Yeah I thought that first one would be busted what if it only applied to yourself? 
---
As for reconstruction i think it should be a full pallet but only can do it once because I find people throwing down pallets for no reason (rank 10 btw)
---
Thank you!
---
That was the idea, not every perk needs to be for the pro players in the red ranks. I know I forget where pallets spawn. Would be great to know where the survivor is likely to run to and could even give you info like knowing if the survivor is even running to an area that has a pallet. They might think the pallet is still there but you know it's not allowing you to react accordingly. But I designed it with new players or people who lose survivors easily in mind.
---
I usually prefer to heal before finishing the gen, so that if the killer rushes the gen after we finish or before we finish we won‚Äôt get downed instantly. I tend to get bad luck for generator spots it feels like, so I don‚Äôt often have a lot of looping areas nearby to stop myself from being hit
---
Survivors don't like loosing. That's basically it. And with the add-on that makes it two hit, beyond any shadow of doubt it was their bad they got down and they suck
---
Red Ranks are stupid when it comes to killer search times, most games are also a single rank 2 survivor with his rank 6/6/9 friends
---
the nightmare = the sleep paralysis
---
Iv never contacted them so i have no idea
---
Killer gets nothing and loses add-ons/offering. Survivors get a free 5000 for "escaping" their points stay the same and they keep items.
---
in my experience its one good survivor and 3 potatoes that throw down pallets as soon as they get to them
---
I wish they would, I want more killers I can play that are viable, I‚Äôm on console so nurse is out of the question, my headphones are crap so Spirit is really difficult, so that just leaves me with hillbilly, who I love but I want more variety
---
your offering will still be used and you get all the points you collected in the game but you can't lose a rank point if you did bad but you keep your items and addons as well.
---
I like Myers.
---
all licensed killers are only purchased with real money. original characters like spirit and legion can be bought with in game currency or real money.

Absolutely. And I find that most of the people who are calling this dude out for his views do it in the most SJW white-knight intensive way possible. I'd be perfectly fine to listen if people PMed me privately about why they dislike Stonetoss' work or if like u/shamjar111 they provided concrete evidence to prove their claims, but 80% of the people bitching on this post just type "STONETOSS BAD MAN REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" and expect me to give a shit.

I don't post Stonetoss memes once in a blue moon because I support his work. I post Stonetoss memes because I laughed at his comic and wanted to make a Dead by Daylight version of his joke.

this looks great, good job!

Thanks good compilation btw.

Danggg, understandable though
---
sorry i couldn‚Äôt more help but no problem. thank you.
---
I think the freddy rework has been fun to play against. I am in favor of some adjustments to EGC though. I played 4 games tonight where I did 3-4 gens by myself and get in multiple chases then everyone else dies. Killer instantly finds the hatch then the doors are next to each other.
---
It really makes you feel like all of your work was for nothing.
---
You just gotta take breaks. Eventually you reach a point where everything feels like a slog, Teammates are too stupid/Gens get done too fast/etc.
---
Hopefully the first of many for her. It‚Äôs great to see that kind of stuff and find it. My entire home is decorated in comic and game related artwork.  And with the amount of hours I have in DbD it‚Äôs great to show some love :)
---
WTF DWIGHT JUST FOLLOWED ME AROUND WAVING AT ME, SLAMMING LOCKER DOORS OVER AND OVER, FAILING SKILL CHECKS AND GENERALLY MAKING A RACKET UNTIL HE GOT ME HOOKED, THEN FARMED ME OFF THE HOOK UNTIL I DIED. WTF IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE? REPORTED HIS ASS, LIKE THAT WILL ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING. AT LEAST I GOT TO WATCH HIM DIE IN SPECTATION.
---
I just wish the the skill ceiling was a lot higher for DBD . Not many things you can improve on in comparison .
---
Darn.
---
It's literally so bad it's not worth wasting braincells over memorizing.
---
Basically you repair gens faster when everyone is dead, but the hatch is open and if the killer closes the hatch you can't fix gens anymore. Also the gates get powered ANYWAYS if the hatch is closed, so working on that gen did nothing.
---
Imagine the demogorgon instead of having normal chase music it‚Äôs the iconic upside down song. And a map that is darker and has spores in the air. Image it would be a difficult map to play as survivor but would be amazing.
---
Haha. No, but very similar. 
---
I just had a swf group waste my time. I was playing legion and that map is just massive in comparison to how far I can get with the killer ability. When I did down someone the hooks nearby were all sabotaged and if I left them to chase someone else they got healed back up. 
---
I was the mouse and they were the cats.
---
The map would be the forest area that will was trapped in
---
Simple solution, don‚Äôt prestige?
---
I really don‚Äôt know how to play against him
---
I‚Äôve teabagged in most games I play, I‚Äôve always just thought it was funny. When I played Last of Us online, it was almost a necessity
---
Thicc Myers?
---
They weren't given to you if you didn't get them 
---
*taps forehead*
---
I only dodge keys.
---
Actually things like this happen a lot in games, usually around cheap tactics. In Rainbow Six Siege peaking out and killing people as they spawn in is frowned up and usually any shooter frowns upon spawn camping. 
---
Look I am not saying what your doing is good or bad but at least own it if your gonna play that way. Its not about unwritten rules I think its more just etiquette on a game. I get the argument 'we are meant to be killers' but realistically this is a video game so it has to be fun for both sides other wise their would be no game to play. Sadly it is not a very well balanced one and their are ways for players to exploit it so the chances of them winning go up massively in their favor, killers can tunnel and camp and survivors can all bring in toolboxes to gen rush or play always in an SWF team. None of it is very fun for either side.
---
She most likely wanted to avoid the hatch play. Sometimes I slug like that to get all 4 kills.
---
exactly my point
---
hahaha this comment make me laugh so hard!! well deserved like!
---
They need to add new dailies for variety. Add something along the lines of break 10 pallets or blind a killer 3 times. Maybe something perk related if you have them. Give me variety baby.
---
Late game slug? Killers will be killers, I guess.
---
Been trying to 360 more on console lol. All I've managed so far is 180's, if you could call them that. Good work though.
---
I get that, but she was just juggling us and we were both already downed with the other 2 survivors killed already. Why not just hook us both and end the game?
---
Ill keep that in mind üëç
---
Don't gen rush low ranks
---
That I don't know. The only thing that comes to mind is she couldnt find you both or something idk. That seems really weird unless she wanted one of yall to win
---
Did you guys just blend in the whole matching basically making him play hide n seek or did you get into chases? Because going against just a bunch of blendettes is annoying and boring making time feel wasted in that match.
---
*Polishing his bell*
---
Thanks for not saying "could care less".
---
Forget the downvotes, just started playing yesterday. Im ootl whats F13?
---
You did, it's a shame more people don't think like this, tunnelling and camping can be frustrating to go against but as someone who plays both sides I can safely say both sides have their equivalent of tunnelling/camping and sometimes it's completely nessasary, just a large chunk of the community feel entitled so they expect killers to follow the unwritten rulebook to excuse themselves from getting better.
---
Being looped at non mindgameable pallets for 5 minutes feels as tedious and obnoxious as sitting on a hook waiting for death.
---
Hey Vsauce, Dwight here

---
Imagine making a meme, posting it with the obnoxious title of "I couldn't care less tbh", and still not realising the hate mail is upsetting you.
---
Just to be clear: people who don't get upset by hate mail don't make weird humble bragging posts about it - they just play the game. The fact you seem to have the need to reaffirm how little you care by public validation would suggest you're not apart of that group.
---
Ngl almost didnt see them
---
Maybe raise or remove the cap on how many times the shapeshifter can be used? As powerful as the killer would be against solo survivors, anyone on comms would be immune to it. Maybe just as power bar instead, like spirit/legion/Freddy. Or even, it could be stalk based, where stalking survivors powers up a bar, which when full, can be used to shapeshifter to a random survivor. (It would t have to be a very long stalk to charge it, maybe like how long T1 Myers takes)
---
They're either extremely dense, or they have the one true plan to massacre you all without a hint of effort or mercy.
---
Imagine if Friday wasnt developed by con artists, it would have been great. DBD would be much better too because BHVR would have direct competition for the first time ever and would be forced to do an ‚ÄúOperation Health‚Äù.
---
This is horrifying.
---
Whats a good sensitivity on console?
---
I figured addons would increase the amount of times it can be used!
---
Ah, yes
---
The devs actually did say camping was a strategy on Stream. It‚Äôs a crappy one for the unlucky survivor, and not a very effective one for the killer, but it‚Äôs still considered a strategy.
---
What a complete load of bollocks. Every fucking word. 
---
Survivor main üòÇüò≠üòÇ
---
If I cleanse a dull totem that was ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù be NOED and I cleanse it, will NOED not spawn? Or do I need to cleanse all dull totems?
---
Have to cleanse them all. If there‚Äôs a single dull totem left, it‚Äôll spawn there. Only 5 on the map at once so it‚Äôs fairly easy to get them all.
---
i personally have it at max for both killer and survivor but that might not be the best for everyone, i think 80% to 100% should be fine in order to find a balance and see what works for you.
---
Jamie Lloyd, is that you?
---
Stop running and walk in an unpredictable direction. She can't see you in power, but she can see scratch marks. She can also hear you though so if you're injured you could be in trouble if the killer has good ears.
---
Same thing with the decoy. Add ons could increase the duration, cooldown, etc.
---
She should just put the broad axe over her shoulder or head and destroy the pallet or damage the generator in one strike.
---
Pretty good meme but it doesn‚Äôt make sense
---
Yeah. Just don‚Äôt hit doctor territory, where the entire power flies on addons, and you‚Äôre golden.
---
I've gotten trapper tips three times in a row though.
---
If all you run into is NOED, small game is a great perk for locating dull totems
---
No offense, but how can you claim to be a killer main but not know how NOED works? To answer your question, Survivors need to cleanse all dull totems prior to all gens being completed to remove NOED. Or, wait until all gens are completed to so you can see the NOED totem.
---
Find the other exit gate
---
How are they getting 4ks with swf. Just let the person die and hit the exit.
---
He's from a really popular game that might bring new console ~~victims~~ players to the entities' realm the same way certain killers can get horror movie fans to take a look at the game?
---
Yeah, you're probably right. They can just buy a computer if they wanna play Bill, keep him exclusive.
---
(1) I never use NOED as I said.
---
(2) How would I know if the survivors are cleansing dull totems as killer?
---
Even if it isn't a Claudette I always get them on Ormond resort I just give up basically if I check all the gens multiple times and they get 2 or 3 gens done it just isn't fun
---
Was all games againts trapper? Maybe its few first times when you face killer, i cant remember
---
People who play the other side do suck, I just can't catch/get away from them.
---
I‚Äôm only playing with one friend. We still have 2 other randoms. We always leave the person behind if there‚Äôs NOED, but that assumes the exit gates open
---
When I hear the phase sound/see her phasing, I double back and stop sprinting. You need to be careful about what terrain you're on aswell, good Spirits can track you through seeing/hearing grass move.
---
its not
---
Trapper‚Äôs cousin: The crapper
---
Good survivors wont know every real and fake pallet. At some point you guys need to concede that a good survivors gonna try to loop a fake pallet, so far there is no true counter play to it like say, OoO against ghostFace.
---
Loop her like you would any normal killer. Make sure she breaks the pallet so you have time to get to the next one. The second she starts using her power, start walking, and change directions. Avoid grass, since that moved and makes noise. You can even try just stopping in your tracks, but that‚Äôs more risky. You can also try turning around 180¬∞ and running over the tracks you just left behind, but again that‚Äôs right. 
---
You can try the same thing when you‚Äôre injured, but it may not work as well. When injured try to stay near things like walls and small obstacles, because it makes it hard for her to figure out which side of the object you‚Äôre on. 
---
As for exhaustion perk, run dead hard for that panic button the second you hear her leave her ability.
---
And always assume she has spirit fury.
---
If you‚Äôre really struggling and finding a lot of spirits, run iron will. It will make it really hard for the spirit to find you during her ability without blasting her sound.

Survivor: play Dwight and hide in a locker for the whole match

im gonna do whats called a pro gamer mover
---
Thanks for the info
---
No. He‚Äôs just bad. Killers need to learn to not rely solely on their totems. I‚Äôm a rank 8-7 killer and I can get 4Ks even when my totem gets broken. If someone gets on my totem, I‚Äôm gonna try and down them. But if I hook them, and they get unhooked, and immediately get back on my totem, that‚Äôs their fault.
---
As for the tunneling, just say ‚Äúhope you love the depip‚Äù because I‚Äôm most circumstances, they depip for hard tunneling survivors.
---
RIP karma
---
Didn‚Äôt they say that they were going to make killer rank character specific? That should be pretty funny, considering that red ranks complain about just seeing nurse and spirit all of the time now.
---
Very underrated after its rework, amazing on killers with good mobility. 
---
Paired with Pop Goes the Weasel can lead to some great stalls.
---
In what world does "IM ALLOWED TO BE A DICK BUT SURVIVORS ARENT ALLOWED TO BE DICKS BACK:(((" sound serious?
---
I never had a chance to get back on the totem since the killer was always around me. Guess they were soft camping me too, but I didn‚Äôt really notice it.
---
to be fair they have to go through an underground tunnel, not a portal.
---
I'm a killer main too. For the life of me can't rank up in survivor. I'm not bad, I can loop killers around for a good while. Gens never get done, and when I finally get caught, I get faced camped. Seems it's every game, I end up with a team that can't hit a single skill check, always get caught/hide in lockers, or disconnect. When I was getting loads of killers with NOED, I brought in Small Game for a while and it worked a few times, as in, I'd get a decent team that would actually get stuff done, I'd get the totems, we'd all escape because killer had no NOED.
---
Most idiot survivors get right back on the totem as soon as they get unhooked. Be smart about it. If he‚Äôs in a chase with someone else, and they get hit, get on the totem. Unless they get slugged, you have a 90% chance to get the totem.
---
"I highly doubt it, especially with bbq and chili".
---
That statement in itself really doesn't do alot for your argument man. Him combined with certain perks =/= his balance issues. If you'd say that some of his addons need a look I'd totally agree with you, however if we're talking about BASE KIT, which all killers SHOULD be balanced on when it comes to his base kit he's the most balanced killer in the game. His power is enough umpf to be able to play in red ranks effectively against a good squad meanwhile it's also hard enough to use that a good survivor can counter play it pretty effectively. 
---
BBQ these days is easily countered by a locker the moment you realize someone has it.
---
yeah but when people say these things you don‚Äôt wanna keep playing the game, because you‚Äôre just gonna get called a noob if you show you‚Äôre having fun
---
Thanks for the tip! I‚Äôll keep it in mind as I level my survivors
---
I was playing cannibal with the two low tier addons which reduce cooldown and chargeup of the chainsaw, Barbecue and franklin's demise, the NOED tier 2 and Deerstalker tier 2.
---
Especially funny was that the fact that the guy who was vaulting the windows the entire match both
---
A: Fucked his entire team by not doing anything for em
---
And B: By telling me that I only won cause I used NOED, while he was camping near hatch....
---

*Entity dabs everywhere*
---
There‚Äôs a chance that he figured that you were the only one who knew where it was so he wanted to make sure no one else would find easily if they just tunneled you to death. Even though that method has its flaws it works against solo players rather than group players.
---
SWF??
---
Because it takes 2 seconds to get in a match and for killers it takes 2-30 minutes
---
It's probably about teachable perks
---
Maybe a little more. Just a smidgeon of F13. There's some merit in there to be harvested.
---
But not with denying players the option of who they play!
---
Yes and no. It's dbd so both apply.
---
The best way to describe it is this. 
---
To spin to the left: Rotate the left stick anti-clockwise &amp; the right stick clockwise.
---
To spin to the right: Rotate the left stick clockwise &amp; the right stick anti-clockwise. 
---
Both stick are technically rolling the same way. Left spins are outwards then inwards, and right spins are inwards then outwards. That‚Äôs the best I could describe it, hope it helps.
---
No it was not. My friend wanted to make sure he could help me if he needed too, and I don‚Äôt know what the others were doing.

I don't have those on bubba im running bbq frank knock out and bitter since i just got him to 20 for a 4p today
---
Because playing "well" for some killers means ending the match as soon as possible. This is a game first and foremost, so matches lasting a mere couple of minutes is considered unfun to most people. It also seems, that if you're murdering 4 survivors that fast, you are being matched with people of a far lower skill level than you are. Which isn't surprising that you're being penalized, but it's pointless if you never get properly matched with people of the same skill level.
---
The majority of mine are killer dailies and I definitely play more killer. I truly think it's random.
---
More like KILLar-wait that's been used unironically before.
---
Then...im not justifying it but sometime if the killer doesnt think youre a SWF they tunnel the person who saw a totem and to make sure they dont lose it. I admit is sucks but its a common thing.
---
Well, Killers have gameplay mechanics and Survivors just have perks. Which Killers also have.
---
I never used the word ‚Äútoxic‚Äù because I‚Äôm an alpha male. People who complain about toxicity are snowflakes who pee sitting down.
---
I'd just do you and figure out your style. Claudette has a bunch of cute cosmetics, and from the leak on the PTB, she's getting another good outfit. Her clothing is really friendly to mixing and matching. As for Anna and Sally, not too sure, but I've seen the the "Lady Lunatic" head paired with her black wedding dress on Sally \[Nurse\], which I think looks nice. Anna, well, you got me there.

My name is Evan Macmillan. I'm 33 years old. My shack is in the northeast section of the Macmillan Estate, where all the pallet loops are, and I am not married. I work as a killer for The Entity, and I get to the campfire every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't camp, but I occasionally slug. I'm sacrificing survivors by 11 PM, and make sure I get a 4K, no matter what. After eating a pallet and doing about twenty minutes of kicking generators before going to the campfire, I usually have no problems looking for a match until morning. Just like a baby killer, I find a match without any fatigue or stress. I was told there were no de-pips at my last match. I'm trying to explain that I'm a killer who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like SWF groups and flashlights, that would cause me to lose bloodpoints. That is how I deal with survivors, and I know that is what brings me pips. Although, if I were to sacrifice them I wouldn't let any escape.
---
I hope you like this copypasta I wasted 10 minutes of my life making
---
Well hard to say I don't know what you like
---
AND down them while they're exposed. It's definitely the most complicated killer daily.

It's weird how now that Freddy is good people are starting to say "bitch" more
---
I kid you not I watched a streamer who liked playing the old Freddy start saying "bitch" in a match when he never had before.
---
Oh I‚Äôm not too upset by it. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not being an asshole to people and ruining their fun as well. I don‚Äôt mind being camped or tunneled if I deserved it.
---
If you hit the survivors you're a bad player /s
---
He's not good?
---
So Dwight doesn't have the potential to kill someone? Everyone has the potential to kill someone! Legion is just some kids with knives! By the 100th time he's abandoned on a hook, I'd say Dwight's more motivated to kill people than Wraith or 3/4 of Legion ever was.
---
Tbh, when I play killer and I hear someone get unhooked and I go there, and the dude who is unhooked is still sitting there, ofc I go for him, and you should too. If he doesn't want to get "tunneled" then he should gtfo of the area or get healed/hitblocked by the guy who unhooked.
---
Its fine my guy. Just play to survive or kill the rest is just whip cream on top.
---
If you play the game you're a bad player /s
---
i would too honestly, i don‚Äôt dc often but he wasted her time
---
Sadly, "competitive gaming" does that. Who even cares about the characters, right?
---
Monto has a video out covering the new bug. Approaching the locker auto-stuns you, but picking up a survivor delays all stuns until the survivor is off your shoulder
---
Best perk in the game, hands down.
---
no its not, just roll the moves stick in 360's and try to constantly look at the killer with the camera move stick, its that easy
---
You are one badass mofo.

Cleanse totems on killers that tend to carry them, such as Wraith, Clown, Hag, etc... 
---
High tier killers don't really run them as much, such as Nurse and Billy. Also, 1 hit down killers don't run NOED either [Cannibal]. Legion's tend to not run NOED either, doesn't combo with their FF that much.
---
Annoying to deal with yeah but so is like every killer if they are even half decent
---
survive with friends, pre made group
---
I‚Äôm not understanding what the problem is in this picture?
---
it is, i do it all the time
---
"yeah, just drop em wherever."
---
this definitely explains what to do to perform a 360. thank you, i have a hard time explaining things so i‚Äôm glad you could give a more technical explanation.
---
&gt; The second she starts using her power, start walking
---
And how exactly do you know what she starts using her power
---
Clearly uneducated in multiple ways..
---
i go there and if i see they are both there and the injured one is more far away i go after the healthy one , unless the injured one dies on the next hook .and this way they cannot call me a "tunneler"
---
didn‚Äôt say it was hard for everyone, it‚Äôs not hard for me now that i‚Äôve gotten good at it but for people who are still learning how to play and evade killers it takes time to get used to and master. but that‚Äôs just my opinion.
---
you should've seen when The Game was first released, half the time the hatch spawned in a wall and was impossible to jump in to.
---
Yeah but like, you must know what people think when they hear stuff like this. Sure, in your situation, even though teachers are paid less than they should be, you can pay your bills and live a normal life. But there are plenty of people with minimum wage jobs, people who need to support much larger families, people with large medical bills, people with mental health issues, etc. who have much worse financial situations and won't have the ability to live a comfortable life no matter how well they budget and plan.
---
So to them at least, saying this kind of stuff really does come across as "poor people did it to themselves," hence that dude's snarky Spongebob meme response.
---
haha, thanks man!
---
Only one, that is all we need as a people.
---
agreed, it‚Äôs better to get used to 100% than anything else.
---
Ah, i can get that its frustrating to play against a whole team of mics but still no reason to leave
---
Your dad takes it with a strap on.
---
Unless she has the prayer beads offering, there is an audio cue. If you haven‚Äôt heard it before, you can probably find it on YouTube if you watch somebody play against spirits Her randomly standing still is also a good tell that she‚Äôs using her ability, but it could be mind games (so if you don‚Äôt hear the audio queue but she‚Äôs standing still start slowly walking but not towards her)
---
The game wouldn‚Äôt let me escape
---
con artists? iam out of the loop here.
---
Dream pallets
---
**You‚Äôre***
---
toxic masculinity is strong on this one aye?
---
Oh I see that now. I thought you were still in the map, not beyond the exit gate. Sorry for the confusion.
---
worded my post wrong. I really meant what cosmetics are other people using haha.
---
A notifier is still better than no in-match clue. Most new players assume that they've been revealed when the 'exposed' popup shows up on their screen, so one that says 'watched' would likely get the message across, or at-least clue them in that something is happening.
---
Maybe she wanted the entity to devour you in EGC?
---
You've got no idea how badly I wanted to reply with just that.
---
It is
---
Nice
---
So you'd forfeit literally all the points you earned that match + double depip when waiting a little longer would secure the points and at the very worst (Unlikely since they survived to the end, unless they did nothing all game) cause a -1 pip?
---
and here's Adept achievements you can't skip unlike dailies\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~
---
Oh I see what you mean now üòèüòè
---
Shut up feminist. I‚Äôll fart in your mouth.
---
I think that Freddy's base stats are really good
---
* survivors are pretty much always in a dream
---
* there's only 1 object that you can use to wake up and it's across the map every time
---
* in the dream you work on gens at ruin speed
---
* he can teleport to a gen if you fail a skillcheck to wake up, then hit you to put you right back in the dream
---
* in the dream his terror radius becomes the lullaby that doesn't help enough
---
* he's relatively fast
---
* he's invisible outside of a relatively short range that he can cover with surprising speed
---
I can understand why survivors are calling him a bit strong
---
what does feminism have to do with this?
---
I just think you sound dumb lol.
---
I can confirm, this happened to me literally 30 minutes ago.
---
I was bringing the final survivor to the basement and i passed it while carrying them. I looked down at the staircase and back at the hatch right there, I planned on getting a 4k but I felt bad just walking right past the hatch and gave it to lil Dwight
---
Next time this happens go afk so you get the 3 crows and the killer will get a constant notification of your presence they‚Äôll come over and see the meg blocking you before they see you and chase her instead
---
I'm only in green ranks now but I always stayed for noticeable SWF groups. I try to pop something to give everyone extra Bloodpoints and usually they'll take the hint and just farm BP with me rather than try-hard and grief me.
---
They can be, but realistically it takes years to earn enough too buy a killer in game. It‚Äôs pretty much pay 2 win or spend years grinding enough for one killer/survivor
---
like let's be real here in these trying times as PC killer can you even afford to dodge a lobby? like how much of a pussy one has to be to skip a lobby just because it's swf when wait times are at least 10 minutes?
---
Personally I think the bear head on Huntress with the body from the ram outfit looks really slick
---
if your butt hurts and you play DBD you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time lol
---
Myers needs to have some cosmetics. Get H2 look in here.
---
Now you're hunting with portals
---
I think left behind got left behind.
---
I fucking love it
---
**killer mains dc forever**
---
You‚Äôre an angry broke feminist. I‚Äôm a successful Bitcoin millionaire. You‚Äôre nowhere near my level.. This conversation is over.
---
They can tell you main Nurse and are punishing you for your sins. In all seriousness false bans happen all the time, long as they revert it it‚Äôs not that big a deal, more annoying then anything.
---
cant argue with that ig
---
Not as bad as the mori as Freddy
---
Groaning Storehouse is pretty ok since they closed the weird double window spot. 
---
Iron Works still has that stupid window tho
---
Ofc the immersed claud is crying out hacks lmao
---
I still belive that when they have communication they will ask each other "is there a pallet here?" and if they say yes then they know the pallet is real.
---
the devs made him to be a memory game killer but when you do that times 4 it will get much much harder.
---
somebody must've been toxic to him...poor wraith
---
I still find it really damn annoying to have it happen to me, but honestly in the long run don‚Äôt care because they‚Äôre wasting time and letting my team win, and if I die it‚Äôs a speedy bit of bloodpoints, so /shrug
---
No. The killer was being toxic.
---
But they'll tell survivors you're toxic for merely existing. There's a severe double standard as if survivors are little gremlins and killers are innocent. In truth, both sides can be immature and butthurt, such as with that killer who was tilted so much over a totem.
---
my only big issue with solo surviving is that mostly i'm not getting saved after i traded places with someone when killer is a camping bitch. they all are too scared to come and try as if they don't understand it's a game while my buds will better die than leave me on the hook and vice versa. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
so basically what i do is dodge blendettes as survivor. cause statistically they're cowards.
---
Uh you're gonna have to show me proof of that.
---
NOED won't trigger on if it's Hexes left. Has to be a dull totem.
---
The Entity is a very simple spider-legged deity, what goes in comes out again.
---
Flashbacks from when I used to play killer on console. When I switched to PC that sweet 60fps made it much easier to counter a 360.
---
Agreed. A lot of bad opinions in this community and I just started playing a few weeks ago. If I want to camp you I damn well will and then make fun of you when you send me a message at the end of the game.
---
I would say new Freddy is the perfect mid tier killer. He can slow chases, has map pressure, and can force failed skillchecks.
---
Just depends if you have hemorrhoids or not.
---
The entity giveth and the entity taketh away.
---
i cant wait to make the switch to PC. i just wish i could transfer my stats when I do, i‚Äôve committed a lot to this game but if it means getting 60 frames and having to start over, so be it :(
---
You totally should. Screw entitled survivors.
---
I'd say he's better than Wraith - Cannibal - Legion. He at least has some map pressure, not much, but better than the bottom. C or C-
---
Saying an author is a Nazi so newcomers have enough information to freely decide to not give him clicks or promote his work...
---
... is the same as being a Nazi.
---
Uhhhh. No. But I think you know that already.
---
It‚Äôs a thing that can happen, but it‚Äôs not a definite thing. If a killer tip comes up generally it‚Äôs against that killer
---
Funny thing is I never even played against this guy. My guess is he got killed by a ghost face, went on YouTube, found someone playing as him and just took out his frustration there
---
My name is Michael Myers and I'm 33 years old...
---
What map were you playing on??? I still don‚Äôt know. Honestly, no hate here but if I see a swf group join I instantly DC. Even though I have bad start up times, it‚Äôs still not even worth playing the game. Rank 6 atm but have played at rank 1 before apex legends came out lol.
---
Because that's what people decided was disrespectful.  Because most people find it annoying.  Just because you or I dont agree with something doesn't make it right.  In general, people get upset when you hit their hanging body.  They think it's better to waste their time and ensure *you* die rather than the team.  
---
  
---
I don't make the rules.  I'm just telling a new player how 99.99% of the community takes it.
---
Nobody is trying to erase his work here. Where do you get that?
---
People are just reminding everyone that he is a Nazi - which is great. Because newcomers to the format like me now have the contextual information that *even though* the comic style is appealing, I will not click on that guy's comic links because he is a fucking Nazi.
---
It's not censorship. It's a PSA.
---
Let me give you an example my friend had already experienced.
---
"I dont know if this pallets real."
---
"Which one?"
---
"Its behind the killer shack against the wall."
---
"I think its safe nobodies been back there yet."
---
"Theres two of them."
---
We all immediately laughed our asses off as he went down. Like unless you have very specific tiles to refer to, you cant tell anyone but the most extreme players which pallets have been used or saved, and even then Freddy can dtill dupe them at loops, making your "skill" as a survivor moot. Youre still playing a guessing game.
---
Saying good survivors can pinpoint what tiles their team means and have every pallet existing within the game memorized before they actually fall into the dream world is incredibly disingenuous.
---
I had to google to see what happened, and that does seem like it sucks but i think he is talking about the two players that got perma banned for shit talking in a single game because one of the players they shit talked was a community manager, just google "Friday the 13th controversy" and you can read the full story
---
Because you will always have political context. You are always free not to read the comments and only read the funny parts though.
---
Which killer were you playing against I think legion has a perk or add-on where survivors can't wiggle out

Well Hillbilly needs to distinguish between a regular break and a chainsaw break
---
Uh, groaning storehouse, It‚Äôs a big L shape map. If you don‚Äôt have good map control it‚Äôs game over for you.
---
So why is she Mandy?
---
What‚Äôs wrong with getting ‚Äòtunneled‚Äô? If you‚Äôre straight off the hook you are the most vulnerable at the moment. Isn‚Äôt the KILLER(hint he‚Äôs a killer, not your teddy bear at your mommy house) supposed to kill and sacrifice survivors? Get over it jabroni, this whole attitude about being nice to survivors is horse shit.
---
Can't wait for rank reset. Trying different builds, memeing around and overall having fun
---
Believe it or not I play survivor too
---
ooor... when everyone else in your team is slugged except for you, you heal others 100% faster and you can see the aura of the killer when they‚Äôre within 32m of the dying survivor. Thoughts?
---
You didn't have deerstalker, you *filthy* hacker
---
Sounds fine if we get built in ruin and noed  :)
---
*when you get that extra 7% movement speed from hope*
---
Could be, would give a counter to slugging.
---
WHATS SO USELESS ABOUT BEING A TREASURE HUNTER BUD
---
She is indeed the least fun killer lol. Hate going against them.

I just made a macro. No big deal. I made one for Struggle, as well as Wiggle.

just don't get hooked 4head

Hello there

And fall for it twice.
---
Smartasses get killed. We always see to that.
---
Yeah but if it‚Äôs a killer who can get to point A to point B in an instant (spirit, Nurse, maybe wraith with correct add-ons) while using BBQ&amp;C, that can can still cause problems.
---
Imma be honest, for like 2 minutes, I was so sure that perk didn't exist because I have never even considered that IN MY LIFE.
---
GASP
---
Legion ain't killing anyone, hotshot.
---
wait.... so you're a single dad with teaching job and you travel 3-4 times a year and yet you have time to grind to red ranks where i - a housewife with no children yet therefore tons of free time, can't be 100% on rank one because survivor is too unpredictable and killer queue times are atrocious? did i get everything right? where do you get all the time to consistently be on red ranks and judge how often those who actually are consistent face good swfs? cause i'm no bitch, i don't dodge swfs unless i need some shit daily with a killer i don't like playing, but i play every day for at least 4-5 hours and i face at very least 40% of full swfs, 50% of 3-2 men and only around 10% of full solo groups on red ranks. that i could tell for sure because i check their profiles. so yeah, again, i call bullshit on you.
---
Looks like he's been spending a little too much time at Moxxi's bar over the past few years...
---
I play 2 Rounds of Survivor to amass Bloodpoints, and then I spend it all on one Killer until I get good Add-Ons for them, and then I murder people and bring a mori.
---
And then I do it all over.
---
Amazing work, thanks for sharing it here!
---
i'd also like to see your steam profile

Maybe we could wait you know?

The Creature of the Black Lagoon hands down, I've always found his appearance very spooky, and depending on his abilities could make a dank killer.
---
Oooh, you got me! You obviously have nothing to say in regard to your lack of gameplay ability and zero knowledge concerning counterplay. Cry harder bud.
---
pallet loopers B T F O
---
Honestly, when you consider the "extremist" wings of either "I only play X" side, my personal experience is that survivor mains are more toxic and childish, whereas killer mains are more whiny.
---
Both sides do have their entitlement issues, that's for sure!
---
you smell like *p e e p e e*
---
*Binging his bong*
---
Sometimes, yeah.  You can't really change an entire community's opinions though, nor should you if you could.  People have a right to think how they want, get salty at what they want, etc.  If you don't like the community it's pretty easy to avoid.
---
Literally the TrU3Ta1ent "You don't win me here" pallet
---
Yeah, it's pretty forgettable.
---
There will always be third party apps ect so people can talk as much as they want. I do agree a well co-ordinated team is very strong but it would be unfair to even try stop people playing the game with there friends. And behaviour would lose out on sales in game as a lot of people want a game to play with friends

I prefer no heart beat before time of sunrise

Great work as always Skemooo. Have you ever considered rendering legacy outfits? :)

The legion- the army

yeah, then they get to still tbag more then they should, but know the killer doesnt even get the good feeling of downing them
---
My name is Evan MacMillin. I'm 128 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Weeks, where all the Foundries are, and I am not married to Meg yet. I work as a killer for The Entity, and I get home every...IDK it's dark as shit. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed after 24 trials, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of curls before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until The Entity wakes me up. Just like a teenager, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning, and want to commit neck-rope by evening after facing Claudette. I was told there were no issues at my last Balance Cube. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to have a very quiet trial. I take care not to trouble myself with any BM, like 4k and Entity Displeased, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with the trial, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to bring a Mori I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
It's nice to get some recognition.
---
I would pay any amount of money for this as a cosmetic.
---
Yep, all true. I benefit greatly from having my parents close by, so I can take a personal trip once a year for a week while they watch him. I also take my son somewhere a couple times for a week at a time. This traveling is, of course, all done during the summer months when school is out.
---
After my son goes to bed at night, I usually get 2-3 hours of time to play games, and my usual go-to (and most played game on steam) is DbD. I have been playing it since release.
---
I don't dodge any lobbies. Hell, I don't even pay attention to lobbies. I search for a game, and don't come back to my computer until the game starts. During that time, I watch tv, fold laundry, grade papers. W/ever I feel like doing.
---
I consistently 3k as a killer, even in Red ranks. Of course there will always be off games where I don't do that well, but those are fewer than the games I 3k in.
---
Go ahead and call BS on me though, random shithead on the internet I DGAF about. I honestly don't care if you believe me or not.
---
Wow this post actually bites. 
---
You guys were a SWF that manipulated the ranking system to face an inexperienced killer and brought in a gen rushing kit and a key, do you just expect all killers to be benevolent and put up with bullshit?
---
They dont want you to be able to half stalk someone, get broken out then get your power back to finish the stalk if you chase that person for one loop. That would sort of defeat the purpose of breaking him out and eliminate the choice ghostface has to make on whether to chase them now for a 2 tap or leave them for a potential instadown later. 
---
If you want to play this type of playstyle however, you can run the two addons to make his power come back quicker, it's actually a pretty schnasty build. It also lets u use his power as a killer version of spinechill sometimes since theres not a huge penalty for being broken out.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
??? These are randoms, and no I‚Äôm rank 15 because I‚Äôm still new to dbd on pc...
---
But you lose emblem progression of you withing a close proximity of a survivor
---
I haven't faced 1 non toxic swf, they are toxic from the get go for me
---
Then they can cause even more problem with devour active. They can prevent you from cleansins and hook you nearby and that can end the match. Where haunted is on a short timer, people can just hide for that bit.
---
my friend without reddit sent this. looks like complete garbage though
---
Freddy* they weren‚Äôt doing that bad, they had someone almost dead on hook but they dc‚Äôd once the final gen was done.
---
Standing up for the right of women a bad thing now?
---
Gonna complain about how white men are secretly the most oppressed people?
---
This came out a while ago and Behavior even shouted it out on Twitter.
---
I actually feel the opposite. So many times I would like to tell my teammate to work on a gen while I save our buddy, or to look for hatch because I have a key, but there is no game chat. SWF is a godsend.
---
He actually crouchs the same speed as pig. Plus he is very very weak against anyone that's slightly aware and he gets countered by plenty of perks.
---
Bitcoin millionare spends his time in the hole? Suuuuuuuuuure.
---
That's Kea Narlsson
---
It's impossible for me to enjoy or even play the game at 200 ping let alone 500. I don't know how people are enduring that lag when I play killer.
---
Due to the lobbytime the survivorquests are still quicker to complete
---
As with everything, devs wont listen or will do it in 2 years from now on. Shame.
---
Sucks that youre a shitty person who attacks the only people who can put up with your bullshit. enjoy your HWID ban, cheater c;
---
Are you playing on console? Your analogue stick might be failing.

*4 man SWF joins, killer unreadies and readies back up after 5 seconds, killer has a secret offering or black ward*

If you want to combat campers you should take a look at decisive strike and maybe deliverance.

Basically, your whole argument is "I can't do it, so it must be impossible".
---
I teach in Arizona, in the United States. This state is one of the lowest paying states for teachers in the country. We even went on strike last year to (successfully) raise our salary amount. 
---
I go to Disneyland once a year, fly up North to visit family once a year, drive out East to visit family once a year, and then usually some other random amusement park or trip somewhere around the country. I don't go abroad, but I still end up paying for things like gas/plane tickets, hotel rooms, entertainment, etc. Of course going abroad is going to cost a lot more, hence why I don't do that often. In fact, I have only ever left the country once, and that was years ago.
---
I pay rent, food, clothes, internet, cell phone, car payment, insurance, utilities, etc etc etc. and still have money to support my son, buy him toys. And even still have money to buy a new game every month or two.
---
I have no credit debt, all my student loans are paid off. It is all possible because I am living it.
---
*General Kenobi*
---
This is a great suggestion by the way, I wish the devs eventually will implement it
---
Fairly sure BHVR also helped out with the development.
---
I think the Freddy rework is great. I play with my red-ranked SWF a lot, and more often than not it just feels like we‚Äôre bullying the killer unless they‚Äôre an overwhelmingly skilled Nurse or Billy. 
---
To clarify, I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúbullying‚Äù by saying that we‚Äôll flashlight spam + T-bag, we try not to be toxic. However, it does feel like the game has too many built in infinite loops + pallets all over that can keep a killer busy while other survivors rush 3 - 4 gens. 
---
Freddy puts control back in the killer‚Äôs hands in that he can surprise you at gens before you can get to safety (sometimes works, but less against better survivors), he can totally shut down loops with his traps, and I‚Äôve fallen for the dream pallets more than once and been hooked for it. 
---
I am so glad to finally see a killer other than Nurse and Billy that has a way of winning that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúslow down the game with Ruin + Sloppy Butcher until I can snowball kills.‚Äù Currently Freddy is powerful, and I am afraid of him, even at survivor rank 1. That‚Äôs what playing survivor is supposed to be like IMO. 
---
TLDR: Freddy good.
---
But in the instance that you DO get broken out (very easy against good survivors and object of obsession) you have to wait for around 30 seconds at base before getting to use ur power again. This massively differs from the better killers who can use their power on the fly
---
Not gonna lie, I'm one of those killers. I only run one totem, but destroying that is destroying one of my four perks. To even up the odds, I'll simply tunnel, camp, and sacrifice whoever destroyed it and knock the survivors down from four to three. Then I continue as if nothing happened. If you can outrun me and lose me then more power to you, but if you don't know how to juke or loop, I'd recommend not breaking any of the killer's belongings.
---
its a default dwight
---
I have several friends who are really big L4D fans who exclusively play games on console. They‚Äôre super stoked about him showing up, a couple of them who don‚Äôt have the DBD wanna buy it now. That‚Äôs partially why. It‚Äôs also just weird to have a well-known character missing from other versions.
---
There's no consensus on which in-game actions are toxic and which are not. Some say tbagging is toxic, some don't agree with that. Some say camping is toxic, some say it's not.
---
What's definitely toxic is using cheats and exploits.
---
It really is. There's no reason to get out of bed. No job, no friends, literally nothing. Just wape up, eat, lose another day of your life, go to bed... 
---
Oh also the perk needs rework too.
---
see, my whole argument is you bragged you can manage your finances and time. i can say anything here too it doesn't have to be truth. and oh man as a teen the shit stories i'd tell on the internet or even just people. i'd imagine things i wanted to happen because i hated my life. i used to write creepypastas, used to exaggerate all i've been through. all for what? i guess sort of validation. and i still do it. cause we live in a society. but i just stopped lying :D cause it's no fun and only makes me feel worse.
---
if you're what you are then good for you, mate. but the fact that you're bragging about it like a teenage boy and saying "if you can't do something it's on you" or call people names with no reason makes you really immature and shows how actually displeased you are with your life. so there's that.
---
Dead By Daylight is a game where sweet unassuming people get their soul sucked out of them and then they get turned into salt shakers. I have no clue how "fun things are fun" does not apply to this game.

#WHOA DUDE THATS JUST MEAN
---
What makes him toxic?
---
Once the killer closes the hatch OR all 5 gens are complete. You decide if you'd rather wait by an exit gate or try to finish 5 gens while the killer looks for the hatch.
---
Also every gen completed notifies the killer of where you are.
---
Wooooosh

just looked through your achievements. so you're saying you got Deranged Pursuit before they changed it? :D OOF either you're a full time nerd WITH GOD DAMN SHIT TON OF TIME or you played on very low ranks cause no way you got it on red unless you cheated the achievement or maybe farmed. to get this one previously it wasn't about skill. it was all relying on survivors being complete potatoes and just standing there for you to hit them again. 
---
i wasn't playing much Legion before they changed them, yet all the dailies(and frustrated days cause Legion was really easy to play and i was crashing swfs with it) and Adept brought me 2 out of 25.

If the devs would care a little the console playerbase might grow a lil ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ignore it all and play how you want. If the enemy cries at your victory, throw your head back and laugh.

This bug has been in the game for many many months. I have experienced this every so often. A fourth survivor won't join the lobby until at least 1 person leaves. I have no idea why this happens or why it hasn't been patched. This will probably be fixed when dedicated servers are live.
---
omg downvoting my comments :D cheesus, mate. yeah, alright, we're done here. you're a big time loser
---
maybe it‚Äôs lower ranks then, like 18-20. i‚Äôm usually within purple/green ranks so i‚Äôm not entirely sure
---
*MAIYERS
---
Yes and no. I have my frustrations, and would never do what is suggested. Instead, I want to know their strategy. 
---
Not every game is an outplay. Sometimes you‚Äôre just the wrong person at the wrong time, killer or survivor.
---
Groaning store house is a pretty balanced map now, the only annoying part is if that bullshit god window spawns.
---
Also I recognize the guy who wrote this, he's still in this sub
---
Did you just assume the entity's gender
---
I think BHVR wanted to make it more difficult for survivors since they have a lot of things that gives away the killers identity and position, such as fountains for Plague or Nurse screech. Therefore, restricting in-game voice communication was their way of trying to balance this out. However, talking in discord defeats the purpose and makes that aspect of the game obsolete. 
---
If they do implement it. I truly hope they give you the option to mute people. I know that sounds obvious, but some games don't even give you the option to do so and their entire game is based around multiplayer [L4D2, for example]
---
**DONT TELL MOM**
---
Tunneling and camping for killer
---
Running overpowered tiles like the Ironworks main window, Grim Pantry main building etc. And using stuff like Strode Keys or Lery's on survivor.
---
Play how you want ofc but you are actively ruining the matches you do this stuff in. Just keep that in mind.
---
Not all of them. Some really enjoy killing people like this.
---
Ye I was thinking about that
---
"And I can vault pallets with my power!"
---
"Or you could just break them?"
---
It's a male? I don't watch Stranger Things but I thought it was a genderless monster
---
Thanks man and yes my writing is horrible
---
Oh nice
---
Somethings been seriously messed up with killers music entirely. I've been chased by Huntress and have had 0 audio ques. No humming, no chase music, nothing. It's been happening for the past couple of weeks.
---
Yup, Ormond is one of the worst maps in the game
---
I wonder how to blind headless nurse....
---
Just light up her stump?
---
Bro that's why I fuckin' started playing DBD I thought I'd be able to randomise it, that'd be a dream come true
---
Not surprised honestly
---
Doesn't 105% mean the gate would be opened instantly
---
Tunneling is when the killer chases a survivor and ignores everything else around them, doesn't go for other survivors even if they are in sight. Term comes from having tunnel vision and only seeing what's in front of you. 
---
Things that are considered "toxic" are killers camping, (in your case tho, it's totally understandable). And as for survivors, they can be "toxic" by bringing flashlights and constantly blinding you and tbagging of course.
---
Iridecent Button: porque no los dos

But GhostFace is one of the garbo killers but has a high skill ceiling how is using him bad REEEEEEEEEE
---
Lightweight
---
Hey, don't bring gardening tools into this! What did they ever do to you?
---
Ah a ~~group of people~~ killer of culture
---
The legion- The teenager
---
Noed isn‚Äôt toxic lol it‚Äôs a viable perk but devourer hope is way better if you match it with hex thrill of the hunt :)
---
Yes I know that I trap the killers shack and so many people fall for it and when basement is there it‚Äôs basically a guaranteed kill
---
Oh ok
---
I agree but I‚Äôm higher ranks they get used to it
---
What did they change?
---
Ye that‚Äôs true
---
Hey dude you play PS4
---
Inb4 Freddy nerf
---
After awhile I started to remember the names of groups. If I see certain groups that I know are toxic, I'll avoid the if I don't have the right addons, perks etc. Otherwise, I'll play it through. But I will build myself to deal with your additional level of communication.
---
No I‚Äôm a Xbox spirit main but I‚Äôm currently deranking with ghostface so I can play casually :/
---
They should rework it to grant a small boost in repair speed for every dead survivor.
---
Oh ok well thanks for the tips anyways man
---
Thanks for this, but again for discussion purposes... Why is bringing a valid item (flashlight in this case) which is meant for the survivors to have i
---
And use in the first place, concidred a bad thing? I mean I get the tbagging being super annoying, but I honestly mostly lol when they do that, considering I'm after their lives after all
---
Np bro
---
Bad idea. They would just bitch and moan from the hook
---
If your camera is repositioned onto freddys husk during the animation you wont be able to pay attention to a chase if you intend to feign it.
---
Alright well good luck man
---
It's usually chinese companies that rehash game assets and don't give af
---
Big companies whose only job is to copy and resell stuff that's already commercially successful. The app store for android and iphones are riddled with them.
---
In Tokio I've seen an ad in a sweets store about another DbD clone where all survivors had button eyes. It wasn't anime-ish, but a little, *little* bit cutesy.
---
I agree at first when the game came out I thought it was strange that their was no game chat since every game has gamechat
---
Now we just need a killer version
---
Wake Up already increases Gate Open speeds.
---
Personally I was thinking a buffed Left Behind could give you the Endurance effect if you're the last Survivor alive (basically MoM but for the last Survivor), or it could let you reopen the Hatch sans a key.
---
Given that everyone else needs to be dead or have Escaped for it to work I still don't think it'd ever get used, but at least it wouldn't be objectively useless in every conceivable scenario anymore.
---
It looks like a dating sim
---
Your WiFi killed its self lmao
---
Got what?
---
I'd say keep him exclusive but tbh I played him on xbox I never picked up l4d for PC so it only makes sense.
---
Are you new to DBD
---
No
---
I don't think it's a clear case. I mean, if you read this subreddit, yes, those topics are usually placed in toxic category. But how many of 127k subscribers (most of them don't post here) actually think so? And these 127k are a minority of overall playerbase. So who knows what majority really think about what's toxic and what's not.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 1 spirit main and if your using thrill of the hunt with ruin / devourer then you will lose the point of 2 PERKS if they destroy them so you‚Äôll be at a worse chance of winning but if your only using ruin then you‚Äôll just have to check on it every minute or so
---
Oh well I got all of the emblems red
---
Which is a very good thing
---
Tithy
---
Oh I thought it was easy I wouldn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm a survivor main
---
Same here man, my killer rank is like 17 or 18 and survivor rank is 11.
---
It does this thing where if another tv is on it‚Äôs like ‚Äúaight time to act like I don‚Äôt work even though I always download shit in like 200 megabytes but when he playing dbd I gotta give him 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ms‚Äù
---
I've always had the idea for the loading screen to look like the main screen. One by one, survivors appear sitting at the campfire.
---
Yeah whenever I get a swf I hit somone in a chase and go for the totem best cancer is to use the Jeff Johansson aura perk and go on the totem when they are carrying someone
---
I'd be more scared of that then anything
---
Boosted
---
Fellow killer main here; shit's gotten boringly easy ingame and queues have gotten too long.
---
But hey, I'm getting a lot better as survivor.
---
Not necessarily, no.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's not all that impressive, but the killers aren't necessarily bad just because they made a mistake against good survivors.
---
I take it as a compliment that they think me and my friends will be any good at this game.
---
People already do this with just Keys.
---
I mean, what would be the point of bringing Left Behind and a Key? Unless it's a green Key you can just yeet out through the Hatch and not even bother with the Gate.
---
Adorabat, adorabat... does what ever adorbat does.

With the trapper? Hell yes! üëç

I‚Äôve seen this consort a lot, but I like the decoy especially. The only issue is facing SWF, they can all group together meaning it‚Äôs obvious who the killer is, or otherwise could communicate easily stating who is where. If swf friends didn‚Äôt exist this would be an amazing killer. Otherwise I suppose it could work, but he‚Äôd be useless early game when everyone‚Äôs together
---
*"oh shit wadda hell"*
---
That's why I play with 3,000 dpi so I can make like 50 full turns with 1 swing.
---
Ye IK I love the trapper that‚Äôs why I main him trappers my boy
---
No one bitched about Ghostface either, in fact the opposite.
---
People here complaining about how overpowered and broken SWF is
---
Meanwhile I'm here groaning when I realize I'm up against one, cause they just act overly altruistic and kill themselves or all DC within the first 2 minutes after a 20 minute queue.
---
Alright, lets say Dwight has the urge to kill right? Lets think about this, no matter what they do, the entity will not make them into killers. Killers are killers, they are controlled by the entity so the entity can grow stronger off of sacrifices. Survivors were brought here to be sacrificed, so unless the entity somehow thinks an empty shell of a body can possibly do anything, then no, he will not become a killer
---
My stand, King Crimson lets me see a premention, and skip time!

*chase opening blares loudly*

Look how they masacred my boy

This is why I don‚Äôt do any daylies, no matter for whom. The rewards are all things considered pathetic. And some take quite a lot of time to finish. No thank you.
---
Random player with rank one in killer and survivor with 5000 hours in the game. DBD: you can do gens and run from the killer
---
Iridescent chaser as Trapper: gg sir.
---
Maybe if the game wasn't so buggy and that most downs that people take in high ranks/whiffed hits in high ranks are because of hitboxes, auto-targeting onto a wall, or lag. Then maybe the community won't be toxic. But then again the resentfulness that makes people baby rage and video games is some genetic ape stuff so, unlikely.
---
That means so much to me thank you so much
---
Wait, Bill is coming to console
---
Why Myers looks like fat Kim Zong Un with white skin and without eyes?
---
‚ÄûSkilled Doctors‚Äú lmao. 
---
You already prevent them from vaulting/dropping pallets or force them to drop early. You can easily fuck up their pathing as Doctor.
---
Dude, go jack off or something, get rid of this frustration.
---
They changed how rbt work now.  If no gen gets done,  they don't activate and will not explode when exiting.  If they are activated they will still explode.  Closing hatch also does not activate them iirc.
---
‚ÄûArt‚Äú
---
It "can" be one of the easiest things to face. It can also feel like having same-pole magnets on your weapon and the survivors the way you just can't land a hit on them. Gens always abandoned by the time you check them, no scratch marks (or ones that lead you on wild goose hunts), the rare hook saved in seconds and instahealed, matches lasting 5 minutes, looping, looping, more looping...
---
SWF is a magical place where hope in killers goes to die a terrible death.
---
Its currently dying. Since Hittokiri and raider rework the playerbase has seriously declined. Something around 40-50%, during the black prior season it was around 6,5-8k now it‚Äôs down to 4K, going as low during the day as 2,3k. Steam numbers since Ubi won‚Äôt share theirs.
---
Plus with Bill coming to console that means we might get cross platform play. So I‚Äôm definitely hyped for Bill coming over to console.
---
I would have to play it when it comes out because while there were safe loops, they were either only safe on one side or out in the open, or even just safe as long as the killer didn't have bloodlust. Even then I will take a few more safe pallets over 3 completely safe and nearly infinitely loopable buildings all right next to each other.
---
I was the baby Dwight twice in a row today. Shoutout to Haze for being such a great killer! :)
---
Dude it‚Äôs only like a million bloodpoints to get a character to level 40. And borrowed time is his only good perk anyway.
---
INTERESTING
---
Yea, faster pallet break time is a no go. Changing the animation would be cool tho. I'm not too sure that the Huntress needs a buff tho, considering many ppl rank her ahead of other killers. Her whole concept is slower movement speed with long range attacks so buffing movement speed would make here pretty strong.
---
Beast of prey could definitely use a rework. Along with many other perks lol.
---
yeah no shit sherlock
---
You are TRYING my PATIENCE
---
Wait, does your flair exists for real? My... friend asks for a link
---
WHY ARE PEOPLE DC-ING IN THE PTB? WHY THE HELL ARE YOU EVEN PLAYING IT THEN? GO PLAY THE NORMAL GAME IF YOU'RE PLAYING TO WIN AND NOT INTERESTED IN TESTING OUT THE NEW FREDDY AND OTHER STUFF
---
In order to do that, the community would have to become healthier and rid itself of toxicity. And asking the DBD community to fuckin grow up is asking for waaaaaaay too much.
---
well they just had a sale on steam and now you can find a full server on pc really easily
---
Insidious Bubba watching them entire time from the corner of the basement: #*IM GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE*
---
David King could beat Legion
---
Yes thanks mate
---
You haven't heard? Survivors doing anything is toxic. Looping? Toxic. Working on gens as fast as you can? Toxic. Playing with friends? Toxic.
---
You could say the same for killer. Hitting hooked survivor? Toxic. Camping hook after gates are powered? Toxic. The list goes on and on. Just play the game how you want and don't be a dick.
---
100 on both
---
Geez I feel this. I just got all my killers up to 40 and now started the survivors.
---
2 rituals were killers: land 4 ambushes with the Pig and hit 4 survivors with shock treatment. 1 got eah of them in 1 game.
---
My other ritual was unhook 3 survivors with Feng and it took me like 5 matches- and I know from past experience that that is one of the easier dailies and that I got it pretty quickly. God forbid you get "open an exit gate with..." and "escape with a new item". 
---
P.S.: I've been playing killer for ages now to level them up (they all had survivor puddings and stuff) and getting my pitiful blood points as survivor was some extreme whiplash.
---
I think its because every thread theres someone showing very unhealthy behavior towards ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù
---
‚ÄúIf u tbag me i will camp you and tunnnel for the reat of the game i dont care i i loose im gonna hack you and ddos your wifi and im going to dox your information!‚Äù
---
I like your idea
---
Why does this never happen to me. I reach the horrible lobby ranks way too quickly
---
DISCLAIMER: I'm not saying this should be a thing, just saying it could be done.
---
Well technically they could, however it would be tedious and require way too many expenses in terms of Steps involved. 
---
What i mean is that they could make it so the game can detect 3rd party software i.e. TS, Discord, Skype, etc., which to my knowledge does not break Steams ToS. Then update the EULA to include use of said programs as not permitted. Then whenever the game detects said programs in use while in a match TO or straight up ban the Person.
---
However this would be very much flawed and propably give more false positives than actually be useful in any way possible.
---
lmao, asking a toxic group of gamers to stop being toxic.
---
Why does it looks like there are two left hands on the self care icon
---
A couple tricks I try and use:
---
If she is chasing you and stops to phase, turn back and run straight at her. She won't see your new scratch marks because they will be on top of your old ones and you can essentially swap places with her if done right. Be careful tho.
---
Run one way and walk the opposite direction to throw off her phase.
---
Run spine chill so you can see when she is coming towards you, even when phasing. Very useful against prayer beads offering too.
---
I usually do not run add-ons as Wraith (Saving them for later, idk) but i‚Äôll always put on a Blink White when it‚Äôs a four-person SWF just to balance the odds a bit.
---
Should of
---
He is killing the game, that‚Äôs not a hyperbole, but a literal fact. Since raider rework dropped so has the community. Before the rework, during the black prior season, the game still had around 6,5-8k player peaks, now we are down to 4,5k and lows of 2,3k. Meanwhile devs act as if nothing‚Äôs wrong and business as usual is fine.
---
You‚Äôre welcome love ‚ù§Ô∏è keep up the good work it‚Äôll get better and easier ü•∞
---
Alright thanks also do you play the game
---
That would be so user-unfriendly that I'd say it would hurt playerbase way more than "SWF is OP" thing.
---
Also, what about Steam voice chat?
---
This is a perfect Delete This photo.
---
If only the survivors had „ÄåGolden Experience Requiem„Äç, they would've stood a chance
---
You don't rotate the right stick unless you want to end up looking up and down :)
---
You just push the stick left(if left stick is clockwise) or right(if left stick is anti-clockwise)
---
Your help is very helpful -pathfinder
---
My dumbass tried to swipe the gameplay pictures
---
I got carpal tunnel syndrome so anything spamming becomes insanely painful.
---
Personally I think proximity chat would be fine, and I am a survivor main... I feel like the only time SWF becomes a serious issue for people is the low purple to red ranks... I‚Äôve only made it to Rank 1 twice and those fellows on either side of this debate in my experience are not nice to anyone when they lose.
---
Survivor mains always good for a little salt.
---
i mean fortnite got the rights so why can‚Äôt dbd??
---
*honk honk*
---
I think sometimes survivors forget that we play survivor as well and know the tricks üòÇ and well those were just poor choices on her end but still ahaha
---
Get an app called PhotoWizard, pretty easy to learn and probably the best photoshop you‚Äôll find on mobile :)
---
Watch out. The developers are gonna see this as a challenge.
---
would probably look off. Huntress is bigger tahn spirit. Never really checked it but I think the wood probably lays lower than huntresses hands can be.Youd need to make her kneel down or something
---
Older killers definitely need QoL changes in the fashion category, idk about making it an actual gameplay buff tho
---
As a Killer main, I hate your hometown.
---
It what's happening when you burn a splinter of any kind.
---
you got asthma too?
---
that's hot
---
Bloodpoint gain really needs a rework, too many characters for so little amount
---
A lotta games have the same thing wdym
---
Happened to me a couple weeks ago, I just t-bagged the survivors and DC‚Äôd when they powered the last generator Bc they were flashlight stunning me and sending hate messages lmao
---
When me and some friends were watching Saw, we looked for the specific parts of the movie that the perk icons came from. They‚Äôre practically all direct shots.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is a hate crime
---
WHY CAN YOU LOOP THE KILLER FOR 3 GENS AND DE RANK AFTER THEY FACE CAMP YOU??????????????????????????????
---
L e g a l l y d i s t i n c t
---
&gt; You are TRYING my PATIENTS
---
I just found out about this and I am happy as shit. If you buy the DLC killers their splinters no longer show up, meaning you are 100% sure to get an Ebony every bloodweb. 
---
Now I can make every Monday a *Mori Monday*.
---
It is easy but everyone starts somewhere
---
The only reason why it doesn't grow is because the community is extremely toxic/punishing.
---
Ik lol
---
Honestly I would love to see survivors get a huge buff , with loads of new items , some form of communication , easier chase escapes and no camping.
---
But than killers would have to be buffed accordingly , so the game would be much slower paced (faster regression , larger maps , harder to find gens) , some secondary objective that gets in the survivors way , killers would have higher mobility , more chase options and abilities , non rng hexes. 
---
I think this would make the game more interesting.
---
Im as competitive as the next guy, but I think people take this game way too seriously sometimes. Sometimes you lose, get over it.
---
Never underestimate the fact that low rank survivors don't know what an unsafe pallet is.
---
Hoes stay mad tbh. Let em talk.
---
Yeah, the only way is escaping through hatch.
---
Easy answer - they didn't know how.  Huntress came out before they knew how to do a lot of things.  Many of things we see added or reworked are things they openly admitted in 2017 they had no idea how to do.
---
It‚Äôs not even the moonwalking. She literally saw you first and then vaulted the pallet, she just spazzed out
---
Meh I played both sides. Killer before 8pm survivor after 8pm.
---
I can't block anything in the game.
---
Aren't actions slowed down anymore?
---
The way to combat it is just move back when they do and then swing.
---
It's pretty niceee *_*
---
If all the survivors stay asleep then his teleport power recharges 60% faster, that's reason enough. Slowed action speed can be applied by one of his add-ons.
---
Yea but with that 5 second transition time survivors wouldn‚Äôt need to worry that much
---
No, only with addons :(
---
to answer #2: You don't. Unless you find them cleansing the totems.
---
Forget the smart ass comments because your cosplay is legion. Despite thoughts on the killer, this is very well done. I'm happy to finally not see a susie legion cosplay.
---
The ideal situation would be preventing the stun durations overlapping, or only allow it to apply to pallet stuns.
---
Are your fingers made of paper?
---
  Tell your friend it doesn‚Äôt (as far as I know) it just represents who I main.
---
I imagine longer placement time of pallets.
---
Still waiting on that Highlander Buff
---
That needs changing for sure. But after watching other gameplay he does need a small need in other areas to make him a bit more balanced. It's hard to say without playing him though as I'm on console.
---
Yup same exact scenario
---
He still have the song?
---
Ash is absolutely a jock though
---
I don't see these good teachables you talk about.
---
I tunnel
---
I agree. I think some depends on rng, but I had one game and there must have been like 50 pallets, most of then safe, with some being ultra safe. So much for more pallets but less safe ones.
---
I did the same as trapper at rank 6 on Lery's.
---
There is also healing, unhooking, searching chests and doing totems.
---
Urban isnt necessary... u can play without this perk. U can put some other perk better i guess
---
Lol I play on console and we don‚Äôt even have a endgame chat to be toxic with
---
This.
---
A thousand times this.
---
Don't be a buttface, be a hugger, like me. Everybody likes hugs. Even vommy mommy and sharp hand Joe.
---
&gt;that when you close the hatch it dosent complete gens it BLOCKS them so rbt isnt active...
---
The endgame collapse timer is shorter than RBT timer (even with Tempered timer). It would have no effect on the match.
---
Did they *really* have to rework the map? I get the need for more variations, and that I like, but what was wrong with the old version? I've won plenty of times as a killer and survivor alike.
---
A lot of the killer wins depending on guarding the school more than anything, but I don't see how that is problematic.
---
Not gonna lie, I‚Äôve had survivors who seem strangely fast.
---
Also tried a few games of survivor on the ptb and it ‚Äòfelt‚Äô like ai was running slower, though couldnt confirm for sure
---
[I am right behind you.](https://i.imgur.com/EDyKa3p.jpg)
---
It really fucks totems. Once one survivor finds it everyone else now knows where it is.
---
The ability is just a Legion copy, but the perks are really interesting. 
---
I'd suggest that the ability would be something that has to do with transformation. It's a werewolf, after all. So.
---
Ability: Transform - (just calling him The Wolf is nice so I'll go with that) The Wolf transforms into his feral state, increasing his speed to 125% (from 110%, so as fast as a Huntress) and increasing his terror radius (from normal to like Doctor's with Calm addons and distressing). Once in this state, he can Howl once in 10-15 seconds to make survivors scream in terror, revealing themselves NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE (lockers are exception). The cons of the state is that aura-revealing perks don't work, and the edges of the screen are blurred, since The Wolf is focused on his prey. AND HE BECOMES IMMUNE TO FLASHLIGHTS. He also cannot kick gens, but pallets are instantly broken. Also, hits instadown a survivor. BUT transformation takes time - about 5 seconds of window for a survivor to GTHO and hide, since otherwise, they're dead. The Wolf can stay in that state for as long as he wants to, but the longer you stay, the weaker you become. Your hunger is going to drive you crazy and your stomach will soon growl louder than you do, so if one doesn't down a survivor in 3(maybe?) minutes after transformation, The Wolf becomes weaker, the speed is reduced to 115%, and Howl becomes unavailable. (Maybe his hits also don't instadown anymore) The screen becomes even more blurry by sides, and the ability bar is empty - signalizing that to regain your power, you need to transform back. The transformation to human is as long as transformation to feral - 5 seconds. Then you need to wait for about 7 seconds to be able to transform back. Why am I not making him just transform back once the bar is empty? Well, because in hungry state, he still can chase survivors, it just makes him like a regular killer, while human form is not for chasing at all.  
---
While not transformed, The Wolf *cannot hit a survivor (because he has  no weapon, however I'm not sure about that decision)*, but can Howl, however, this Howl is much weaker than in the feral state, revealing only the closest survivor, but this also can be used much more frequently - every 4 seconds. The pros of human state is that all perks work, and they're all 5% more effective (for example for Ruin, hitting a good skillcheck  results in 10% regression, greats are still 0% however. This bonus applies only when in human form probably, but since that may be hard to implement, this certain one may also apply to feral), while all aura revealing perks are 50% more effective (basically they would reveal survivors for a longer time - two times longer). Maybe something else to make human form viable, I'm already dry of ideas.

U look amazing friend! Nice pose  and angle :)

I feel sorry for the younger generation who are all snowflakes and call everything toxic. Online games have always been about talking shit and attempting to humiliate your opponents, it's part of the fun. 
---
Some of my most enjoyable memories playing online was when we would get a particularly vocal opposing team on 4v4 Execution on Gears 1. It's so satisfying beating people who talk shit and being able to return it. 
---
If you don't like the way people play a game, or you don't like the things people say in chat, either don't play online, or git gud enough so that they can't say or do anything.
---
Who‚Äôs surprised? He spends all his time talking about how killers are all pathetically weak and victims of SWF bully squads, and unironically says stuff like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt play by made up survivor rules‚Äù. Nobody should be surprised when his fan base defends a killer playing like an asshole, they‚Äôre just following his words to their logical conclusion.

I hate it too. It really does wear down your buttons. I was thinking just have it auto struggle with a button to press to stop struggling.
---
You forgot unbroken.
---
No key hole, did they nerf it?!
---
Unbreakable isn‚Äôt good, it‚Äôs too situational to be worth running.
---
I am rank 3, I have a friend that ranks between 3-5 and we play with a guy who cannot get past rank 16.
---
That's our friend group, you can think it's suspicious if you want, but that's because of lack of blood flow to your brain.
---
You're just a bad killer.
---
It depends on the killer whether or not it works, high rank killers can expect it and it won't work on them, the whole turning the camera thing is smoke and mirrors, just there to make it look flashy, and nauseating.
---
I hate when the ping starts good but then turns to shit as you play. Look man, I jumped that window 5 seconds before you even got there there‚Äôs no way you should have fucking hit me!!
---
I think we need more time. Maybe we figure smth out and he‚Äòs a solid A, maybe Survivors adapt hard and he‚Äòs a C or D. 
---
He most likely gets some post ptb tweaks as well.
---
Actually gen rush is something killers came up with cause they are babies and don't know how to play the game and just blame survivors for their mistakes.
---
Since all the gens were popped, did they run that killer around for 5 gens before actually going down?
---
Ok buddy
---
Tunnelling is when you focus on one specific person, specifically when you chase someone after being unhooked. That's not toxic and a valid strategy sometimes, because if you have been pressuring survivors and they aren't doing gens, you will obviously want to down the injured person rather than let them heal.
---
Camping is toxic and a bad idea. If you know someone is close search for them near the hook, and obviously returning to hooks to check for altruistic survivor is okay, but camping will just result in everyone doing the gens while you camp and them all escaping if they manage to unhook anyways. 
---
On survivors side, things are mostly just visually toxic. Flickering flashlights (not blinding), excessive t-bagging, and wearing bright and silly outfits. Another thing that's toxic is when they chase the killer to keep the killer on them.
---
Honestly, the only thing I don't recommend doing is camping, it's not safe as a killer and not fun as survivor. As survivor, all those things are valid, you just come across as an ass.
---
Gen rushing is not a thing.  Your problem lies within SWF.
---
Their objective is also to survive. Thats why perks like Balanced Landing, Iron Will, Unbreakable, Borrowed Time, etc exist. If you come in with no survival perks and just generator perks, that‚Äôs gen rushing my friend, therefore its a strat
---
I assume you didnt read the post
---
was that survivor being toxic or something? so the killer decided "eh, everyone else can leave I just want this one"
---
Not really since most games the killer has found the hatch or finds it easily and then closes it. That‚Äôs the way 85% of my games go and then both exit gates are right besides each other and there is no escape and it always happens when I‚Äôm lumped in with a bunch of potato‚Äôs who show rank 4-5 but couldn‚Äôt hit a skill check to save there worthless live and are standing around, doing nothing!
---
893 points though
---
Oh no I did, but the post is irrelevant.  What you‚Äôre describing is not a ‚Äústrat‚Äù or exploit.  It‚Äôs a group of people playing optimally to complete their objective.
---
Are you sure you're not the toxic manchild
---
r/accidentalracism
---
https://youtu.be/oHC1230OpOg
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not mate why?
---
What if it is, say one green rank survivor and one purple rank survivor, and you as a killer are simply rank 16? Is that fair, is that being outplayed?
---
Did you go to a convention with this on?
---
The hardest one is the nurse one. 
---
But goddarn that was annoying.
---
It‚Äôs a Paradox...
---
Nea, a jock? umm no
---
Oh ok im new here. Thanks.
---
Omg I would pay you to make me one üò©ü•∞ it‚Äôs so cute
---
You're a hate crime
---
Should be like Gimli makes a finishing blow on downed orcs in the LotR Return of the King game.
---
As someone that dies whitin 5 minutes, I would like this a lot
---
Yesssss!
---
Just out of curiosity.. how do you know the exact time? Is it on their site or something?
---
The only way to survive the trial is to complete the gens, or escape via hatch when everyone else is dead. 
---
Hiding or looping the killer only enable you to keep the killer's attention whilst other people do gens. It's assisting others in doing the main objective, but it's not the main objective. Survivability perks are assistance perks, not objective perks. They're popular because a meta strategy is to hold the killer's attention for as long as possible with second-chance perks whilst other people complete the objective. That's the strat. Doing the objective isn't.
---
The **moaning** storehouse
---
Will be cool a replay system. U can watch killer and others teammate cameras
---
Plus there is that pesky gen aura silhouette that gives away all survivors when they are banging gens out
---
Its a joke lmao People just dont know how to write
---
Me as well. Even if i dont die that fast. Maybe like the post so it gets upranked.
---
They should just name her Mrs. Piggy and throw in a Kermit De Frog hat for Dwight
---
Yea it would be. But i guess that would maybe take too much storage. Maybe it could be an option you can tick so it saves on your own PC
---
You might be higher rank but of course you will get to Red rank if you play a lot. Slugging is a strat, slugging wins you games. If you watch ryanpez69 on twitch, he slugs most of the time with Billy, that's how you win games against survivors rushing gens.
---
&gt;Just out of curiosity.. how do you know the exact time? Is it on their site or something?
---
Rank reset always happens at the same time of the day every month. At some point I had my DBD open in the moment rank reset happened so "I wrote it down". 
---
Once I knew the exact time and day (13th), I made a command on twitch so I can effortlessly check whenever I need to remember it.
---
None of which rewards you as much as doing generators and escaping - with the exception of healing and unhooking. It's the objective survivors HAVE to do to escape, the others are optional.
---
That's weird both me and a whole bunch of my friends experience and complain about it.
---
New trapper/hag skin look solid af
---
Its a stratagy to not heal in order to push out fens faster. Thats genrush.
---
Why
---
I run gen perks but i make sure they aren‚Äôt op. Resilience isn‚Äôt op because you are required to be injured so i run it. Same with This Is Not Happening(which i run). Then i run SB and Adren because i hate how slow i usually move.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed so many killer mains on this sub are desperate to be seen as victims, it‚Äôs so strange. I‚Äôm a 50/50 player so I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äòside‚Äô but it‚Äôs always the hardcore bitchy killers on here that make me laugh with their ridiculous suggestions for balance. To me it‚Äôs crazy that it‚Äôs survivors who have the reputation of being entitled cry babies.
---
Chinese copyright law basically doesn‚Äôt exist, that‚Äôs why most blatant knock offs tend to originate from china
---
Ohh nice!! I love this!
---
I played against 4 p3 claudettes and killed one of them, then they called me a tunneling noob, fun times
---
wtf is your problem lmao
---
Survivors get. A 2/4/6% haste for every survivor that leaves the game alive. At t1, max you can get is 2%, t2 4%. This helps keep the theme of being 'left behind' and gives a solid buff while staying the classic niche perk that BHVR really loves giving survivors.
---
Same issue. I‚Äôm playing more killer to try to get the timing down.
---
Sprint Burst should just be made into Breaker
---
‚ÄúJust force another player to drop a safe pallet‚Äù 4Head
---
They removed that but added it back in. Fantastic idea!
---
That would be stupid OP in endgame. No point to even look for hatch if you open the exit gate 50% faster.
---
Its working as untended unforetunately, this is why I said its a dead perk
---
I think left behind deserves a new effect but it cannot be ‚Äú+ repair when someone dies‚Äù because killing someone when all three others have this perk actually punishes the killer for doing their job. Inversely itd be like a killer perk to make survivors be sacrificed faster for every completed generator. Unless y‚Äôall wanna go back to Dying Light meta bonus repair when someone dies is not gonna be fair. 
---
What Left Behind should do instead : If you are the last survivor, during the last 10/20/30 seconds of the End Game Collapse, you gain the Endurance effect. 
---
Boom. You have a very strong but risky niche perk that pays off for being at deaths door but is still countered by detection perks and also possibly help people from last second BM moments.
---
Leave senpai alone!
---
I would never dodge a swf group!
---
... mainly because killer queues are so long that i never see the survivors join cuz im usually doing something elsewhile waiting
---
SWF is a real problem and I wish it didn‚Äôt exist tbh. Would be so much easier to balance the game without swf. What a lot of people don‚Äôt realise (or just don‚Äôt care) is that any survivor nerfs or ‚Äòbalance changes‚Äô, as the devs call them, they nerf swf a little bit but nerf solo survivor a lot. Solo survivor is the most miserable experience in the game imo.
---
Ich habe ein titty
---
I might just be unlucky but i brought a Dwight to hatch, probably was an off game for him cause he was a higher rank than me but he was last left, and he ran away with hatch right there to go do gens.
---
If you can't interact with anything, you might as well dc because this glitch will occur. I got it in a our match when I couldn't wake anyone up or heal against a Freddy.
---
Earrape swamp boat noises be like:
---
same on PC. Complete idiots
---
Nice. This will be my first reset since I‚Äôve started playing so I‚Äôm interested in seeing how these games go directly after reset..
---
Yeah, given the choice Ghostface probably would have chosen to be there.
---
Gimme your fucking video so I can like it and give a positive comment you tRaSH GhOsTFacE
---
Of course it‚Äôs a Blendette who would complain about being found. ‚ÄúWHAT DO YOU MEAN THE ENVIROMEMT GAVE ME AWAY?!?!?!111111‚Äù
---
He's stronger than an ant, if an ant was this big.
---
Because otherwise it'd be way too strong.
---
Find a loop. Loop a bit. Drop pallet anf sprint burst to next loop. Loop a bit. Drop pallet. Sprint burst to next.
---
Good loopers would infinitely loop the killer unless it's nurse or spirit
---
Are you wearing two jackets at once?
---
That‚Äôs really good!
---
Yeah pretty much, I'm a low tier red rank killer,  and honestly countering 360 on PC isn't difficult if you know to look out for it. I can't say for console though I've never tried &gt;&lt;
---
then how do you think Left Behind should be reworked? cause it can't stay how it is
---
Personally i like the dream snares more because a good survivor will remember which pallet just popped up and ignore it.
---
Not to mention PC killers have a bit of auto aim too which helps a lot. It's much harder to land "m1" attacks on console, especially for new players.
---
I'm a victim man! A victim of this evil game! I used to be a nice boy! Dead by Daylight turned me into a cunt! üò≠
---
Can't wait for dedicated servers. If they work as intended *and* we can start punishing these kinds of players, it'll probably be the best edition to the game.
---
I‚Äôm not really sure tbh, I feel like just buffing the action speed for everything else besides exit gates would be one of the options tho
---
I don't know that one either, it is frustrating to get tunneled and gen rushed but at the end of the day everyone can play however they want to play
---
I play both survivor and killer, I played a lot more killer lately and by gods, survivors are toxic, I actually feel for every killer now. I can't imagine how much more annoying it is for a survivor to deal with those types of people. I'm starting to play survivor more now though, so \*crosses fingers\* spare me entity \\o/
---
Dont bring noed\\rancor, dont teabag unless killer brought noed\\rancor or tunnels\\camps
---
Ghostface's weapon wipe is based on a scene in the movie. An user even posted the clip of that part asking for it to be the weapon wipe before we knew what it would be.
---
happened to me too
---
Its a strategy to not spend 40 seconds self caring, or waste time searching for a teammate.
---
I am proud of you.
---
Did i say it was wrong?
---
He was right. "Should of" is incorrect English
---
Lmaaao so true. I saw a guy comparing new Freddy to Legion, saying that legion gets stunned after using their power but Freddy can act right away after teleporting ( after casting for 74928742 hours and giving the survivors warning, mind you). The salt is real
---
It looks like you dropped a grenade or something.

This is Huntress' weakness, and why she's an average-at-best Killer.
---
Run a full gen-defence build (Ruin, PGTW, Surveillance and Thrilling Tremors), defend the 3 gens which are closest together.
---
They never said camping was, pal.
---
Wait what ? Lmao I didn‚Äôt know that
---
I usually just blacklist these toxic people and give them special treatment next time I play killer and see them in my lobby
---
Does that justify insulting others? No.

Sick

But people were complaining about certain aspects of GF before he was adjusted to work more like intended.

Nah, now that's too much already. I think 30,006 seems fair
---
Frank, get back in your corner!
---
Despite the cast time he has really solid map pressure. You can literally get to the otherside of the map with it. It's not really supposed to help him catch survivors off guard, the pallets and snares are.
---
Hoping I start seeing him in the high ranks
---
I think they don't want to do it, coz otherwise we would be able to have tierlists based on true statistics.
---
Killer Queen has already touched that totem.
---
Wut? No. Under that logic, Overwhelming Prescence instantly drains all items used. 
---
105% faster is ‚Äòslightly more than double speed‚Äô. Just like how Enduring used to be ‚Äòslightly less then half stuns‚Äô.
---
Yes of course, those times I meet a camping or tunneling killer I praise them for their skills in tunneling or camping.
---
I HATE CLAUDETTE MAINS. MAYBE NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SURELY MOST OF THEM. THEY'RE ALL THE FUCKING SAME.
---
Wait, you actually *get survivor dailies*!?
---
I have gotten nothing but killer dailies for weeks
---
Through his router out of the window after missing that first hit
---
My character getting hit before dropping a pallet because of my shitty connection
---
Its pretty bad when the apple store has it even since they pre-screen everything that goes on the store (granted thats mostly just checking for like, viruses hidden in the code but sti)
---
I mean yeah, you‚Äôre right. Not sure why you‚Äôre getting downvoted for it though.
---
Depends on both how you define "toxic" and "unfun". Toxic doesn't always mean malicious, it may just mean "bad for the game" or "negatively impacting the experience". Which is the point of view Im talking from.
---
Not banable? Absolutely
---
Nothing inherently wrong? Hard disagree.
---
You choosing to stare at a guy and ignoring every other gameplay aspect and him not getting to play the game for 1 minute 30 because you want/need him killed is inherently bad game design and wrong.
---
I also understand that camping is necessary when all survivors eush to the hook when you are there, im not stupid, the devs need to think of a way to fix that issue.
---
Ah yes but I have haunted grounds
---
Nah the entity has „ÄåThe World Over Heaven„Äç
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I agree deerstalker is good Bc I don‚Äôt always slug but every time I do I lose track of the person :(. And then it seems like I let them bleed out on purpose. 
---
I like devour hope. But the survivors has ample time to do the totem.
---
Yet people still use him as example of how killers get immediately nerfed because survivors bitch much :D
---
PC
---
Can't play the game, Steam is not connected error.

Would someone be willing to transcribe this?  Im having some issues reading it

Played ptb and new freddy is way more fun to go against. Hell at least you can see him coming

I dun wahnt eet

I dont get it

Heh heh

I just grab every perk I can, if you dont use it who cares? More room for addons/offerings

Good for you that you can manage your emotions, hope this meme makes you feel ‚Äúspecial‚Äù enough
---
lol nah, if you want to learn go look around.
---
Exactly my point
---
"ARE YOU CHALLENGING ME?"
---
**laughs in dbd mobile**
---
My first game of DbD ever was my rank 20 noob self playing survivor with 3 rank 1 survivors and a rank 1 killer. I died virtually instantly. Good times.
---
I did the same with Monstrous Shrine, you know what happened? The game decided I needed level 2 and 3 of that same perk
---
I shouldn't have to go through multiple levels of rng bullshit just use decent perks. I've already unlocked them, just let me use them
---
GF is pretty viable because of his perks tbh. I run Myers a decent bit, but I'm to the point where I dont have alot of fun. Survivors like to get toxic and tbag at pallets, not realizing I'm building evil within to t3
---
English please
---
If on PS4 go to the achievement and hit Square and it should show the details
---
it‚Äôs a meme, so stop making a big assumptions about me. The only reason why I made this meme was because When I saw this format it was the first thing I thought of. And also just because I don‚Äôt care about what other people say about me doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Your just making assumptions over a little meme which SHOULD be taken as a joke
---
"I play this character because it's dark skin and blends in, and purposely use dark clothing to make me harder to see, So if you can see me, you 100% have cheat's on because I expect everyone to be blind like me" &lt; Does this sum it up ?
---
I had no idea either!
---
Survivor world problems.
---
I think so, you might have to be the last person alive to use it. They also replaced all the keys in your inventory with flashlights.
---
Ok, but why not just loop the pallet?
---
Run NOED. They Gen-rush they get to enjoy not spending time looking for totems.
---
Because rank reset and wanted to have fun doing 360s because when you get high ranks there not possible anymore
---
We are few in number but mighty in strength
---
I just want the chapter 13 killer to be Jason.
---
Legion is love
---
Legion is life
---
Very cool shot, love it
---
Honestly I thought the background music was Minecraft music at first
---
I mean thats usually how you play killer. With safe pallets, your main focus isnt to get a hit. Its to make then drop the pallet ASAP. Getting a hit is just a happy accident.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWHHHHH
---
SO CUTE
---
Juke montages are at least interesting/funny. Much more than I can say for ..meme? Not sure what to call it really.
---
Screams alot. Sends hatemail. Thinks he's the best player in the world at every game he plays, so he blames the game when he loses.
---
If I hadn't met him over 2 years ago I definitely wouldn't be his friend, but as it stands, he's one of my best friends.
---
He just has a REALLY inflated ego
---
Well duh. 
---
What good player will drop a safe pallet before getting the maximum number of loops out of the area? You can‚Äôt force a good player to do anything.
---
YEAH YOU‚ÄôRE RIGHT You can‚Äôt see or hear anyone who is downed without deerstalker so I‚Äôm clearly a hacker
---
1: guys trapped in a room (the bathroom near the basement on the game) recount the crimes of Jigsaw, where people were put in tough situations where they potentially could survive, usually by sacrificing something of value. 
---
2: group of people in a house full of traps / puzzles. Bad things happen to most of them. The house would make an amazing DBD map. 
---
3: changing it up, the puzzles now seem to offer no escape. This one also has a somewhat human element to it, but is maybe the first real dip in quality. This one is set in The Game - Gideon Meat Packing.
---
4: same setting. Bigger drop in quality than the last one. Tied up a lot of loose ends in the story.  But this one (and 3) feel like torture porn. 
---
5: I found this one to be more mild. It‚Äôs a bit different, with a group trying to solve jigsaws puzzles together in order to survive.  But one by one...
---
6: this one has a political / serious underlying message and I like it for that, but overall it‚Äôs another dip in quality and to me it is forgettable.
---
7: the worst film. It abandons some of the premise in favor of style and shock kills. This was originally billed as the final film. 
---
8: I liked it. It‚Äôs a reboot. I actually think it captures some of the charm of both 1 and 2. 
---
9: who knows?!?
---
Each film also has a major twist at the end (a different one each film). Won‚Äôt go over those here but I do think 1, 2, 5, and 8 have twists that genuinely impressed me. 
---
Also, if you‚Äôre going to watch them, I recommend 1, 2, 3, skip ahead to 8.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this bug, maybe uninstall and reinstall the game again?
---
Also rip David :(
---
‚ÄúThis is the 1400 time I‚Äôve been killed in the fog prior to the Entity swiping me up in the 80‚Äôs‚Äù
---
Yeah I just had to waste thousands of BP for it! Wooo great system!
---
Shut your condescending ass up
---
Would it matter though? You chase them around a pallet and it either stuns you or it screws the survivor. All it does is let me know in advance if I‚Äôve won the loop or not.
---
If its a special pallet like shack or inside a major building then I‚Äôll remember for sure if its real or fake.
---
Nah. i make it a point to always give hatch to the last survivor if they aren't toxic(constant tbagging, flashlight blinding after a stun, etc). If they're toxic i drop them near it, close it and let them either bleed out, hang them up, or let entity get them depending on which would be fastest for me(hook nearby? Hang. End Game gonna end because they shook off but couldn't get the door/hatch? Let them die to entity. Complete dbag who messages mid game to tell you to uninstall because you hit them once and their team got a gen done before you did? Let them bleed out next to the closed hatch.
---
why though? it helps with frustration. i do that if no one of my friends is available to talk my frustration through. and when i see some relatable posts others made about how they feel bad after a match, i can give them emotional support or maybe even advice of how to deal with frustration/a problem they faced. and people on here did that for me as well.
---
*Switches to omegablink ebony nurse*
---
No. It's really not. People get one guy every 10 games say "GG ez" and immediately jump on Reddit to try and convince us the community is fucked. It's.. really weird.
---
Whole freaking thousands! Imagine that, when single game nets you tens of thousands...
---
Your goal for thoes pallets is to reduce the amount of loops they get out of it through mind gaming, optimal routing and cutting them off. Thats your goal. Force them to take a hit or drop the pallet, making that area unsafe for future chases.
---
That Claudette was SO helpful standing one inch away from the escape.
---
When you give me a clip of how to mindgame all the new badham safe pallets, I‚Äôll respond to you about mindgaming safe pallets. Lmao.
---
Yes I love being outplayed by prayer beeds spirit
---
Just to waste it on more shitty perks that BW decides to give me! Wooo!
---
I seriously can't believe people are defending this slot machine bullshit. It's honestly baffling
---
this is extremely reassuring. i swear i always think im close enough
---
comparing new players to people with disabilities is not at all sensible. Also there are lots of veteran players who are occasionally juked. It's a difficult mechanic of the game and if it works and you pull it off, that's fine by me.
---
Lol pretty much this. His snares, pallets, and any speed slowing add ons dont work if you‚Äôre awake. As Freddy I wouldnt want survivors to wake up now.
---
The secret is. If you juke yourself, you juke the killer.
---
Thanks I appreciate that! I would love to write more if someone is down to read it :)
---
So legitimate question: when you're exposed, be it Haunted Grounds, Tier 3 myers etc, does it affect your playstyle? Like, you change how you play when you're exposed to be safer right?
---
Ok, so following that line of thought, why is being injured any different? 
---
You talk as if being injured means you automatically lose. Like, you plan on playing exactly the same way except you go down in one hit. 
---
Being injured doesnt stop you from repairing gens. Being injured doesn't mean if the killer *sees* you suddenly you drop to dying state. How fucking helpless are you? Get out of your comfort zone, run Dead Heard, run Iron Will, take botany knowledge and a medkit. Self care is literally the least effective way to heal. 
---
This post sounds a toddler complaining they cant eat ive cream for dinner.

Alright but like that was actually important information to the stardust crusaders. They were looking for someone with 2 right arms.
---
I rebound it to M1 instead of the space bar. Much quieter and easier to hit rapidly, and somehow it doesn't conflict with any other keys.
---
If you're on controller tho you're sol.
---
The poor cameraman was murdered :(
---
Would matter a lot, in case there is a real pallet near a dream one, and also in case that you are not being chased and you see a dream pallet, you can use it
---
That‚Äôs not a fix, garbage lobby times are not a feature.
---
Good point however there is also the pallet mind games that go on when you reach high ranks. 
---
It turns out knowing if you have won in advance is a big deal if you forgot that you placed the pallet there in the first place. The fake pallets that the Doctor can see are an example, sometimes the doc can mind game himself and you don‚Äôt have that with Freddie. 
---
As for any God pallet you placed, those are easy to remember, the other 6-7 dream pallets you placed, not so much right? And that is the point
---
Technically it‚Äôs not since Friday is from a popular movie series.
---
Except you can't dribble anymore?
---
Whats it like?
---
13th of each month
---
I had 100% (all DLCs) but haven‚Äôt been arsed to do the ghostface dlc ones so I‚Äôm stuck at 96% for now
---
Honestly there is no saying either sides "mains" are crying more. In the end both are crying about equally.
---
As for Balance "Ideas", the same is true. I have seen about as many stupid heavily survivor favored suggestions as well as killer favored ones. 
---
PS: Still waiting for someone to bitch about Slippery Meat or Unrelenting being too "good" and i am certain that someone will.
---
Technically this game have so much more players who spread the knowledge, and this game has A LOT of movie characters, not only 1
---
Behavior seems to think we out here mashing that space bar about to shit ourselves over the prospect that the game will fucky out and kill us on the hook but it just ain't the case
---
It's more like
---
\*mashing the shit out of it\* &gt;\_&gt; \*yawn\*
---
\*game does a fucko and kills you anyway\*
---
"ew that was bullshit"
---
It doesn't add anything to the gameplay at all honestly. Just let us hold the damn button down or something jfc
---
Ah that makes it easier to remember. Thanks for the answer :)
---
I recently started playing survivor (rank 6) and don‚Äôt think I have the same experience as you. 
---
Rarely I‚Äôll get hit through pallets, but usually it‚Äôs because I decided to drop them very late or the killer was almost walking into me. 
---
For windows, I do get hit through them, however the devs did say that this is intended. You said you get hit after you start sprinting away, but I guess it really depends on how much you‚Äôve sprinted, because I think they get an extra ‚Äúreach‚Äù when hitting through a window(I don‚Äôt have a source for this but I‚Äôve been witnessed it as killer). Do you have a video we can look at to see how far you‚Äôve sprinted?
---
Congratulations!! What was Your favourite? Apart from the Platinum? Mine was probably Where Did They Go. I've probably done it 100's of times over helping other people get it. Lots of fun.
---
I feel like you took this too personally lol. 
---
It‚Äôs simply a meme based off a pattern OP has seen, and to be fair. I have seen this exact thing OP is talking about. 
---
It‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre one of those people that complain on Reddit after losing but don‚Äôt go criticizing someone over a meme.
---
I always love when I get called a camper when I hook someone, turn around and their dumbass friend literally runs up towards me to unhook or tries hiding in plain sight. I down and hook them and suddenly I'm a camper.  
---
No, bitch, you and your team just dumb.
---
Plague Doctor Doctor
---
You know PlayStation has a built in screenshot button....
---
Every map has safe pallets. I was refering to the very common safe pallets like Shack or Jungle gyms. I havent seen much footage of the new map and haven't played it myself. Obviously pallets that are just in hall ways, you cant mindgane. Thats why I also said optimal routing and cutting off. Firce them to drop pallets or take a hit. Thats your game plan with super safe pallets. 
---
You ok, guy?
---
I mean in game legion does too
---
Im gonna fucking choke you with my pubic hair and take a giant shit on your fucking face you unintelligent cock waffle
---
No one from the movies thinks ‚Äúoh she/he is in dead by daylight‚Äù This games more popular in its player base but as a whole Friday is no undoubtedly more well known.
---
I rather not make Freddy weaker after so long of being low tier
---
Nyeeeeehhhh
---
But when shouldn't flashlight stuns work? I need answers.
---
The post is about badham rework and the pallets on that map. 
---
If you won‚Äôt speak about that, I‚Äôm not gonna read what you say.
---
Peace.
---
Just try out the other killers that you already have lol.
---
Watch videos and see who interests you most for buying. Also check if you have splinter offerings to play as dlc characters for free
---
Nobody can tell you who you would like to play the most
---
‚ÄúExploit hit?‚Äù Cmon now. If the survivor gets hit through a pallet then it‚Äôs 99% because the killer got to it first. If the survivor isn‚Äôt already most of the way through the pallet toss animation then they will get hit through the pallet
---
Maybe also let us see who was SWF in the endscreen.
---
With Iron Grasp, it's safe to drop them twice before you have to start worrying about them just getting back up.  
---
At least, that's what it seems like for me, but I'm fairly low level so take what I say with a grain of salt
---
I wish i could use this as my PS4 background. :(
---
What point exactly? You said you don't use NOED as killer, but keep running into it as survivor.
---
I don't see how the killer not knowing that you're cleansing proves your 'point'.
---
r/PS4_and_Ipad_Lover
---
Why would you be dropping them for?
---
I'm not talking about rage post, or post that search for advice. I'm talking about people who just want to win every single game they play. When they lose there's always some game mechanic to blame or some perks to nerf in ridiculous ways. The idea that he/they could have lose to someone who played better than him/them doesn't even pop in their mind.
---
u/PS4_and_Ipad_Lover
---
It needs to be fixed already. My survival rate has done down immensely since that bug came out.
---
It‚Äôs not weaker if it‚Äôs only demanding from the player. The mechanic is great but not thought provoking. You should be aware of what you are doing and that makes you a great player
---
why? i've seen this pattern of posts/memes a lot as well, the ones OP created. am i not allowed to voice my opinion or something? or should i create my own post about OP type of posts?

This shot is spectacular and I love every second of it. Great cosplay!

I was under the impression you couldn't get dailies for players you don't own, as I've never gotten them.

I'm fairly certain you can't get dailies for characters you don't own.
---
It‚Äôs a good perk tho
---
Exactly! &lt;3
---
I thought that too, and apparently you aren‚Äôt, but I‚Äôve seen other instances aside from my own of the game ignoring purchases.
---
Why? The Killer shouldn't have to make the gamble like that, that is the role of the survivor.
---
Hell yeah
---
In the event that the Laurie Strode (Do I have the right survivor?) brought Decisive Strike? Or when I really like a survivor and I drop them at the gate and open it for them because they aren't toxic
---
But mostly Decisive Strike. Rank 20 and it's already getting on my nerves
---
Honestly I agree. I'm saying this as a purple rank survivor who plays with a red rank survivor.
---
Looped this ole billy boy for 3 gen's and decided to facecamp me, Meanwhile the last 2 survivor's decided to crouch around the same place you see them right now. until i died. Love my teammates!
---
It‚Äôs not a gamble. The killer placed the trap there so the killer should remember where it was placed
---
i've never considered doing that, but i will now.  
---
thank you for suggesting that
---
Glad people are noticing this stuff cause it‚Äôs been bugging me since the ghostface was in ptb
---
God Hill? That's a new one
---
When you get accused of wall hacks, when you just have headphones and surround audio, and all the survivors are so loud when they move around.
---
*Also Meg's breathing sounds like the Nurse*
---
DS now will only be able to activate 60 seconds after getting unhooked, and will activate before you are able to drop the survivor.
---
Dribbling them is literally useless against ds

---
What about the "As the last one alive repair the last generator and escape through the gates" achievement?
---
Because icemans argument is that since I‚Äôm a killer main, I should know how cleansing dull totems before NOED works. If I had used NOED and it didn‚Äôt spawned in, how would I know whether they cleansed all the dull totems, or if they cleansed the dull totem that was ‚Äúsupposed to be‚Äù NOED(if it worked that way)... unless I went around the map and found every cleansed dull totem; but that still wouldn‚Äôt prove anything. 
---
My point was, playing killer =/= understanding the unexplained survivor-side of each perk(which I can‚Äôt see unless I play survivor)
---
"No, Nea, no! Wait your turn. It's Claudette's turn to die. I'll be out for you in a minute."
---
Or the opening cut scene. Which leads to the question of why can't I disable the cut scene from playing each time the game starts?
---
I used to wear the same cosmetics for dwight but I switched the pants for the P2 Pants. But kept the pizza hoodie :)
---
Oh. Well now it's just for the fun of watching that Baby Dwight scramble for the doors. I guess Iron Grasp can go back on the shelf.
---
I just looked through footage and alot of thies pallets are mindgameable through red stain manipulation. The killer is hidden so you have to make a guess. Honestly there's alot of UNSAFE pallets on this map now. The main building has a 2-3 safe ones but thats it. No other safe, unmindgamible pallets. You've been acting like an unrational ass, my guy.
---
True. Most sfw fuck themselves trying to bully the killer and being overly altruistic, so it‚Äôs a pretty easy win

Forget that. In my rare non toxic matches I outright open the gates for the surivors
---
WA!
---
It's just high levels piggy-backing on friends' smurf accounts to inflate their already bloated ego's... report them for unsportsmanlike behavior and don't think twice about it.
---
It's not like BHVR is doing anything with the reports anyway. They are survivors, they are like BHVR's friends with benefits! If a Killer gets let say an infinite heal bug that the dev's refuse to fix immediately killers do get banned... It's the curse of being a killer main! It's better that one person gets rectally probed then 4 people whining!
---
\- But in all honesty you had a good 3k game and got decent BP, what are you really upset about?
---
Welp. Was trying to get a friend into the game (I talked him into buying it for $10). Played SWF with him. 2 out of the 4 games we played the killer camped the hook (one face camp, one that circled around 10 or 15 meters). One game he just tunneled my friend ("WTF, how is this fun at all?"). And one game was actually fun (despite losing anyway). 
---
So anyway, my friend thinks this game sucks (because we happened to get stuck with a bunch of 24-and-me killers). He returned it.
---
But then authors complain about tunnelling, which is also a fair thing. Survivors have perks to prevent it (eg dead hard)but they still complain. It works both ways. Idk why what I put warranted downvotes tbh
---
Rework idea: player can activate the ability while there is one generator left for a massive repair boost but can no longer exit through the gates
---
I agree. I used to be red rank before I took a break, my friend was green because he doesnt play enough to really break the ranks before reser. However in terms of skill hes definitely way beyond that. We do feel really bad when we go against someone who is obviously new and whiffs all attacks. Game is much more fun with killers who apply lots of pressure. We‚Äôd both be happy if rank reset was changed so we were put with people more on our skill level with our playtimes.
---
You took this meme too serious
---
Thank you for your contribution
---
Yeah, really makes one wonder.
---
Amazing job! Did y'all make the masks?
---
If an add-on doesn't say whether it stacks or not, it's pretty safe to assume they do stack.
---
It's not about the meme, it's about the discussion of "Toxic communities". The meme is fine.
---
why couldn't we have tried seeing him un-nerfed and back at his release power?
---
then we could have seen, hrmm, maybe it really was a knee jerk reaction.
---
now, all he has is stealth at extreme distance, teleport to gens occasionally, and... either snares or pallets. and pallets means you have only one other addon.
---
they need to be asleep for your power to affect them.
---
what else do you have for when they're awake? nothing.
---
there's not even a slowdown on sleep anymore.
---
"THIS one'll get him!"
---
"Weak minded pussies" ... is this the kindergarten playground? XD
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
It‚Äôs clearly a joke
---
The matchmake it is horrible and it doesn‚Äôt adjust to the levels of all
---
 No, you sound whiny for being a jerk to people who are trying to state the most obvious option to deal with the bullshit mechanic. Just because you don‚Äôt like the answer doesn‚Äôt mean you have to tell someone to shut up.
---
If you throw a tantrum like this over a game mechanic I can‚Äôt imagine what happens when you perceive an injustice IRL.
---
or it could be entirely different
---
the power could be entirely passive. they just see differently. some things make them glare like yellow on a black canvas. some blends in like yellow on white.
---
Bloody 'ell that guy can talk. He makes some great points though.
---
My wifi also likes to play favorites.
---
Personally, I always skipped SWF lobbies when it was still possible.
---
No, they are not always toxic. Yes, the match can be fun.
---
However, there is also a distinct possibility that the match is not fun and stressful. And I like my recreational time casual and relaxed. Since the new lobby system dodging is no longer possible, so if I see a lot of prestriged outfits or toolboxes/flashlights I'll just go for Leatherface and a nice mori.
---
Your warping the conversation. It was about mindgaming new safe pallets. The pallets in the building arnt new. Nothing is new about them. I also never said 3 god pallets was fine. Youre taking words out of my mouth. The pallet variants outside are very mindgamible. You also bring in balanced landing. Your bringing perks in a discussion about mindgaming pallets. Sure thats part of the game but you only bring it up to favour your side of the argument. With that, I should say killers can use thier powers to either close in befor they get to the pallet, hit them over it, trap, slow them down or body block. 
---
Again, you're just acting like an ass. The map is much better then it use to but its not perfect. If you wish to keep discussing, learn how to argue, clear your head and tell me how the pallets are unmindgamible. If not, have a good day.
---
I did a build for it, with Urban Immersion, Iron Will, Left Behind, Balanced Landing and BNPs for the last gen and got it pretty quickly with that. 
---
I'm only missing Taking One For The Team achievement, which is probably why I will never finish this achievement hunt. I'd have to farm 150 more survivors off hooks and ruin a lot more games to get that. That achievement explains why survivors do so dumb plays and ruin games all the time, no idea why they never changed the achievement to like, 50 instead of 250
---
I love how you got upvotes and i got downvotes, guess i have to explain why snares are better but you already did that, thanks
---
Well I don‚Äôt use the perk so I don‚Äôt bother with it.
---
Tell me please, what do you gain from going on and on here? Some peoples‚Äô sole purpose on Reddit is to prove to themselves that they can talk down to somebody.
---
As a killer mainz, fuck you
---
Self care and diversion are both trash tier perks.
---
Dead hard is still good even though exhaustion don't recharges while running anymore.
---
There was a bug. It‚Äôs in the patch notes that they fixed it on the PTB. Was starting to get on my nerves too.
---
At first glance I thought it is Amumu from League of Legends.
---
If its a huge map you‚Äôre kind of boned, true of many killers to be honest. Bring Ruin obviously, I dont rate corrupt intervention but other people do so worth giving it a try.
---
Then just try to apply as much pressure as possible. Break off a chase if you see someone nearby on a gen. Try to spread the pain out. Maybe take a sneaky endgame perk too like bloodwarden.
---
They didn't nerf him, it was a bug that has been fixed in the PTB. His range was decreased as part of a bug and now it has been increased back to 40m
---
Adrenaline, BL/Dead Hard, Decisive, BT or another perk of your choosing.   
---
Self care stinks.
---
Tenacity buff looks great
---
This is so true, these days this sub is full of whining, complaining and arguing. Calm down people, its just a game.
---
Oh wow! I didn‚Äôt know that.  I‚Äôm too scared to rely on others to heal me!
---
Pizza dwight for life
---
I use balanced, adrenaline, self care and DS. Although people say the new DS blows dick, I think it is still a good perk to prevent tunneling. Balanced is good cause it‚Äôs like a sprint burst you can control when it activates on the chase, it also has a use while exhausted, self care for obvious reasons and adrenaline because it can save you for the round.
---
Is it against the killer rules to bring a flashlight?
---
Grow up.
---
How...
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bully me‚Äù
---
Thats better than i ever could do
---
ok
---
Yogurt should be a killer with SpaceBalls the flamethrower as his power.
---
I always give the hatch to pizza Dwight, babies, and non-toxic people. God bless the non-toxic. They‚Äôre the heroes we need but don‚Äôt deserve.
---
Yeah i‚Äôm starting to learn my main(legion)‚Äôs lunge but i‚Äôm just having trouble with aiming it.
---
r/Cynical-Meme was right, ur taking this way too seriously. I get that it helps with your frustration, but if too many people start doing it it becomes very frustrating for the other community members. No one wants a community full of arguing and complaining.
---
You are comparing three different mechanics saying they should behave the same... lol
---
As someone who plays Ghostface a lot, SWF can really screw me over.
---
Yea, but alot of people just want to be like Noob3 so they act and do toxic stuff and then rage when they get outplayed
---
You can easily tell which vaults will get you hit 10 seconds before they happen. Similar thing applies to pallets, but you have only 3 seconds.
---
Three mechanics that revolve around placing a object in the map that can interact with the survivors and give you a edge over them if they don't handle them correctly, aka, traps. Yeah, definitely super different.
---
Had a killer look exactly like that lag switch me 20mins ago. Maybe we got the same guy...
---
This is amazing. XD
---
Personally run Adrenaline, Sprint Burst which i‚Äôm switching out for Balanced Landing ASAP, Resilience, and This Is Not Happening. Leads to a pretty good build. If you want to build up items and, specifically medkits, you can run Ace In The Hole, Plunder‚Äôs Delight, Pharmacy, and Balanced Landing or Sprint Burst or whatever.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs hard to express even a middle of the road opinion without survivor mains puffing up and freaking out. The sub is naturally going to be 80 percent survivor people since the games asymmetrical. Though they will quickly say they have hundreds of hours on killer, while still screaming at you for suggesting camping isn‚Äôt really awful or maybe gens should take more skill/ or more time.
---
just take it then
---
That's actually super creepy.
---
If people bully you for drawing stuff, then can stfu and get rekt.  Practice more drawing!  It's a fun way to spend time!  Do iiiiiiit.
---
Its probably because its so long. Its nearly 50 episodes if I remember correctly.

I mean part 7 was pretty long and not nearly as forgettable
---
Should be an average.
---
3 rank 10 and 1 rank 2? Face a rank 8 killer.
---
Yes, what else would it be. Your risking not healing to do gens faster, hence "gen rushing".
---
Well I'm just blown away that people defend it
---
Also yeah I get a bit peeved when people talk down to me, sorry for being human
---
Yeah, that's why it's a sarcastic joke
---
...And have different impacts in the trial. If you tell me a fake pallet is the same as a bear trap then you are telling me ‚Äúthis bike as wheels so it must be a car‚Äù
---
For the skill check issue, make sure your TV is set to Game mode. It really makes a big difference.
---
I would like it to be hope and wake up combination. Gives you a small speed boost+opening gates faster when hatch is closed and you are last survivor alive.
---
I feel attacked
---
Speak for yourself loser
---
If it's that kind of situation, I agree with your point. But that nicety is being abused by the community. Remember, SWF isn't supposed to exist in the first place, why shouldn't they have the little extra difficulty?
---
This is adorable I love it!
---
Maybe it isn't even a lag just shitty internet. I've been accused of lag switching many times and I don't even know where to get one or how it works . Truthfully if my roommate is using the wifi it gets really slow, but not with anyone else, just this one roommate who set up the wifi
---
"You guys are mean" &gt;:c

Actually people were bitching about GF
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/
---
The information is pinned on every page.
---
Everyone can relate to this at some point lol
---
It would work if flashlights didn't exist. If those three survivors use flashlights to keep the rank 17 alive, then you're forced to chase the reds who will destroy lower rank killers
---
I mean, I always keep that in mind when I am lagging in a game but when the lag spike always conveniently hits when I am trying to vault to get away, it raises some red flags.
---
WHY IS LITERALLY EVERY GHOSTFACE I ENCOUNTER ON DBD RUNNING FRANKLIN'S, I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO BROUGHT AN ITEM WHY ARE YOU WASTING THAT PERK SLOT.
---
I guess, but you could just... face the wall. At tank 8 the killer is good enough to do that
---
If gens go to 100 seconds without ruin... just imagine how upset everyone would be with ruin after such a change.
---
I certainly haven't noticed it.
---
Because you could be doing more efficient things, imagine running past three people on a gen and the killer STILL goes for you.
---
"Hey John, if you're going to die, run to an open field."
---
More like Can‚Äôt Sia. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry,  I‚Äôll Sia myself out
---
Spirt, Legion new Freddy. Most killers can't just use their powers whenever acaully
---
&gt;I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a cheap hit though, more like getting outplayed. But yeah
---
That is not an intended feature so it is cheap.
---
It's still broken. Yesterday I walked right behind him and watched directly at him, still didn't get the sound queue and guy on gen got exposed and downed. I have no idea what the game wants from me or how to draw him out of stealth.
---
Holy shit. That‚Äôs like what, 20% of your life since the game released?
---
50/50 coin, they either find it first or last.
---
He crouches slower then pig acaully. Pig is 92 he is 90
---
My friend is a level 14, I‚Äôm a level 1. We pair up and sometime she lands red ranks with me, sometimes I land in his ranks. You need to keep in mind as a red rank 1 survivor, rank don‚Äôt mean anything. There‚Äôs better ranks 16s than there is red ranks.
---
omg pigggg

DING DING MOTHERFUCKING DING

You have other parts in this comment thread. You just called me and others an Asscunt. You are acting like a fucking dick towards OP and others by insulting their work and not being a reasonable adult. You are taking everything like it is an attack on you. People are saying "Hey, do you think that you are taking this personally? It isn't directed at you. This is just a meme." and you are whining, complaining, and acting like a dick. I understand salt and anger. I am a Killer Main, I get both sides of the spectrum. I get angry at stupid shit that happens like Self-Care being run 24-7. However, instead of being angry and taking this post as an insult - I laugh at it. When I am angry, I say stupid shit that should never happen in game because it would break it so terribly. However, instead of being angry forever about it, I continue on. 
---
Also, we didn't say "Don't voice your opinions", we are telling you "Chill the fuck out my dude" - Go ahead and voice your opinions in a reasonable manner, instead of being hostile to everyone on this thread.
---
That was sarcasm my dude
---
Pretty much yea.
---
N Titty
---
It would be an interesting buff, when last gen is done, all survivors can see your aura at all times.
---
But in this situation, they said they never did anything, and you never said they did in the messages. You just said why not. Im tired of seeing this whole ‚ÄúKillers can‚Äôt be toxic‚Äù idea. Its annoying. Killers can‚Äôt complain about toxicity when they are also fueling the problem.
---
Don't forget the mixtapes! Always need music in a hunt!
---
It's not always an option, especially for a rank 17, who most likely can't loop yet. But I do see your concerns, and  I don't think flashlights should be the main factor, as there is other counterplay.
---
     I am currently rank 6, and have gotten as low a rank 4 as killer and I've never had too much of a problem.
---
Tf you mean producers cut?
---
If you‚Äôre gonna be toxic In game, finish being toxic. Writing someone gg wp doesn‚Äôt fix your child antics. You‚Äôre the wrong one in this.
---
Those actions require a lot more calculation on the server's part than running straight forward, that's why that happens. A lot more conditions and animation changes depending on the distance, angle or the debilitating effects applied if any, also displaying the bubble but promptly making it invisible if the killer has direct sight. There's a surprising amount of things that go into a vault and if someone has very shitty internet, the server will struggle if the internet can barely hold it.

KILLER CLOSING THE HATCH IS BS
---
I think for the Trapper he should set a trap on the ground (one spawns in just for the mori) and he forces the survivor's head into it while they fight back.
---
I would suggest that the Wraith rip the spine out of the survivor maybe? Fits with his normal weapon being a spine and a skull. He could even break their legs beforehand so they can't crawl away. 
---
And the Hillbilly could chainsaw the survivor's legs and then hit them in the head repeatedly with his hammer.
---
They looked quite right to me... It was like a specification between commas. I mean in my mind it sounds like: "you don't have to open a thread on Reddit (talking about insane nerfs and changes) every time you lose a game". Without the sentence between commas the phrase has still a meaning. Btw English is not my main language so maybe it sounds right only to me (I'm sorry).
---
You don't always need to heal. Sometimes doing gens is more important and is more help to the team as well.
---
I know I still nada a 3k but is frustrating when they troll me bc I‚Äôm worse than them
---
Imo Huntress is more map dependent.

Where's ataxic respiration and catatonic boys treasure

My point was that they're really ez to cosplay. Just put on two jackets, make a mask - boom, you're Legion.
---
Destroy ALL OF THEM
---
Saaame dude. The only killer in recent memory I've been able to get a 4k with at my current rank is trapper, which is fun b/c survs are predictable so I got soo many traps that game
---
Rank 1 takes forever to get to. Until they have Rank 1 Survivor and Killer, they have to grind and go with Meta or whatever seems to work. If they didn't have those two achievements, meme builds would be more prevalent.
---
Ardetha fan? Bruh epic

Naw it's cool, I DIDNT see it. The only hex totems I ever find are haunted ground.

Never thought of that until now, it‚Äôs badass

Looks like you was lagging and teleporting on his screen so that what take him so long to finally hit you.
---
Btw it was just supposed to be something funny and I like to read other players opinion even if I don't completely agree with them. I'm sorry if you got so pissed about the discussion with other redditors.
---
holy shit, man
---
&gt;My dude, shut the fuck up. If you don't like what you see, UNSUB.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre one of those people that complain on Reddit after losing but don‚Äôt go criticizing someone over a meme.
---
you're trying to do what exactly? defeat my "anger" with more anger? i'm not even angry, i just don't understand the fuzz and, please do follow my logic here, why in the world people can't complain and suggest crap but yet someone else is entitled to criticize them but then i am not entitled to criticize those who criticize?
---
&gt;You are acting like a fucking dick towards OP 
---
what i said was
---
-it feels like a lot of people who post similar things to you, OP, don't play as much and not that much involved and prefer to shitpost rather than actually play.
---
^that is not being a dick.

&gt;shut the fuck up/Don't post it/Stop being a dick
---
^that is being a dick
---
&gt;and others by insulting their work and not being a reasonable adult

where exactly did i insult someone's work? if you mean "low effort meme" that's literally a genre of shitposting that you call memes that don't involve original content or much effort to make, we good? how we feelin, mate? there's a shit meme i made, do look at the title lol https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c6lfr4/low_effort_meme_posting_should_be_a_flair/
---
You down somebody near killers shack, hook them in the basement. Take some time to plant traps around, and while you do it somebody manages to trigger it, you down them and add them to your basement collection, returning to previous routine. Meanwhile someone else triggers another trap... damn it guys, is it hard to wait for 30 secs and then go save your teammates?
---
The one that was cleansed first was Ruin
---
No, there's no way for killer or survivor to tell which totem is for which perk. Otherwise, there'd be way less sense in running Haunted Ground.
---
This statement is utter bullshit tbh
---
Very much big reel Dead by Daylight survivor mulitplyer gayme very feel 100 certified actual reel game with 9 survviors and 6 killyers and buy are game. Certifuied reel 100% seel of approoval.
---
At rank 1 I'm running Spine Chill, Iron Will, Dead Hard/Balanced/Sprint, Adrenaline/DS/WGLF/Meme Perk.
---
In this game, people are gonna trash talk you no matter what. If you get a 4K, they will write toxic stuff to you. If you get no kills they will be toxic. If you don‚Äôt camp or tunnel they will be toxic. Best thing to do is ignore them and just enjoy the game the best way you can.
---
I thing they should put skill checks and if you fail you lose health instantly, but if you hit a great skillcgeck, you gain a little bit of health
---
This is my only problem with GF. He is a really balanced killer, but completely bullshit to play against when then game doesn't register that he is right in the middle of your screen.
---

Omg the entitlement
---
Entire sub is BABIES
---
But yeah, there are a lot of people who just love to complain, and I get it, sometimes (a lot of times) things don't go the way you planned and many thing seem unfair and stuff, but you know, you just gotta get over it and continue playing. Making posts about the same complaints, about survivors being assholes, about killers being assholes doesn't really make this sub better, and doesn't make the community less toxic. We should focus on what really matters... meme shitposting.
---
Jake is pretty rare even though he came out with the game
---
Amazing!
---
The legion = the edgy trick or treater
---
Freddy‚Äôs is the biggest lunge, he can hit me as I leave the killer shack all the way from the basement.
---
You sound like the nerd tbh
---
Cool cosplay but fuck legion bro
---
Dude this game isnt for you
---
Funny how you don't mention survivor sided "outplays", hell anyone who thinks they outplayed a killer while having instaheals bnps or the most bs of all keys aren't exactly smart and hey did i mention adrenaline?  A completly braindead perk with no outplay to it, it even gives you invulnerability for a few seconds. I must correct you though there is outplay in predicting survivor pathing and pressing m1 - it's called mindgames, it's reading your opponent, it's the most fun in this whole game honestly.
---
I agree, BUT playing LF correctly requires a lot of skill! /s
---
Thats really good! I‚Äôm thinking about buying legion really soon, looks fun.
---
It‚Äôs still a game, you won‚Äôt die if u derank.
---
&gt; Rank 1 takes forever to get to.
---
I'm not sure if it's still a thing (I feel like it'd be harder for survivor, easier for killer), but I got both on first try (like "this month I go for survivor r1") with reasonable hours (Steam 2-week playing time was never higher than 35-38 hours, and that wasn't DbD only).
---
I can't anymore. My braincells are dying one by one in this conversation. 
---
You are literally acting like a victim to OP and you are being a cunt. I'm telling you exactly you are acting. I might be a dick, but at least I can admit to it. You are acting like everything is an attack on you. THIS is an attack, THIS is me calling you out for acting like a douchebag. You are whining, complaining, making yourself out as a victim when you are doing it to yourself. Just mellow the fuck out dude. You took this post really fucking seriously.
---
PRAYER BEADS IS FUCKING BROKEN AND NEEDS REMOVING
---
Well...Let‚Äôs see! If we go with it‚Äôs been out for 3 years ( since they just celebrated it) we can say there is 26280 hours available in his life since release.  With 2000 taken up by DBD that is about 8% of his time since release spent on the game! 
---
Another way to look at it is he spent 92% of his time since the release NOT playing DBD.
---
I like reading some of the posts for nerfs and buffs for a good laugh. I don‚Äôt mind ideas floating around but sometimes it just makes my head scratch. Yes some things combine with the right perks and add-ons can make a game 1 sided at times but what are the odds that‚Äôs going to happen more then once a day in matchmaking? Well unless you get the same killer cause it‚Äôs a slow day.
---
Plus these threads make a nice conversation with my buddies when we play DbD casually and bring up perks that we don‚Äôt usually see and ponder what would turn this unused D tier perk into a B tier perk. Not everything needs to be viable 100% of the time. I personally like some of the situational perks. Some things are better on certain maps. Unless you have an offering for that map chances are you may of screwed your self out of a perk you like using. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I get upset at times when it‚Äôs a farm map or shelter woods and I have balance landing. Feels like a waste of a perk slot, but that‚Äôs the price I pay. Adapt with different builds and try to mix and match. You don‚Äôt have to always run the Meta unless it‚Äôs a sweaty night. Have fun! We‚Äôre all in this together and should enjoy such a great game.
---
But....they are mandatory? Lol.
---
I had someone tell me that this sort of thing was exploiting and not an intended game mechanic. lol  yeah ok buddy killers were not intended to be able walk backwards, that's one hell of a developer oversight there.
---
I'm fairly certain it's not just me who thinks the system is dumb
---
Matchmaking is trash in this game
---
I was refeeing to healing, sorry ill edit.
---
Exactly. I swear people want him to have built in prayer beads where he gets an instant grab on any gen he teleports to. It‚Äôs a map pressure tool! Not a free grab or hit.
---
Is the point of the killer to...ya know...kill survivors?  
---
How is camping a hook,or tunneling,or whatever else considered "bad form"?
---
It's literally how the game is built lol
---
Fire crackers
---
No man, I never did because I heard people get banned for it.
---
wow the only answers i get are these guess the game is locked behind paywall sad i wasted money
---
It‚Äôs the most boring games EVER, for both killer AND survivor when killer camps. 
---
I understand ‚Äúcamping‚Äù when you saw/hear another survivor while hooking but camping while everyone else is on the other side of the map ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
What rank?
---
Glad to know it's not just me, although it sucks. I contacted support, hopefully, they will answer soon.
---
I swear playing killer makes me audibly groan sometimes at the stupid shit survivors try to get away with like going for the unhook when I only walked 10 feet away. Wish me and the teammate they just fucked over could slap them through their screen for that dumb play.
---
11.
---
The shrine perks can only be purchased with in-game currency. They aren't behind paywall.
---
Im fairly certain they made huntress' humming 2D, like freddys new lullaby. So it no longer has a directionality to it, just a distance range. 
---
They also lowered the terror radius audio for all killers in the last patch. The distance is unchanged but its quieter overall.
---
The only characters that you can't purchase with in-game currency are the licensed ones. Which makes sense, because BHVR doesn't own those characters.
---
dude what the fuck
---
Fact: You don‚Äôt have to make a meme on something you probably have done yourself.
---
"THERES NO WAY MY BRIGHT PINK SHIRT GAVE ME AWAY. YOUR HACKING" - a salty survivor after her swf team even backed me up on her wearing bright pink
---
One of the best cosplays i've seen on here
---
I only tell people good luck and end up in hook faster than Adams with deliverance. Help
---
i think he really likes you
---
Seems perfectly fine to me
---
I am sorry about this, I know it is gonna make you sad but you sound like 10 yo and in general you should not be allowed to play the game in first place. Come back here when you grow up and we may give you a better answer
---
why was this double d meme template redrawn?
---
School Shooting. Pallets went from loud thud to a trigger. Horror game, dark and terrible atmosphere, and suddenly "BANG" - Kinda tends to trigger your deeply repressed trauma.
---
I never messed with any game files or anything. Didn't have legacy, I have the game for less than a year. Didn't cheat in other games either. I know that some people would think that I am guilty just because I posted this, but I am really just a casual player. Don't care about ranks or anything. What would be the point of cheating in a game like this where you don't even get ranked rewards?
---
Nah I agree with you, you could probably get away without the commas but the way you explained it makes perfect sense too imo
---
I doubt it, since it recently got a minor rework when EGC was added.
---
You can get the perks from the shrine by using shards which you get by playing the game and gaining xp points (the same goes for any character that isn't licensed). The DLCs are also on sale very frequently and the lullaby for the dark DLC is completely free. Playstation Plus users got the game plus two DLCs for free last year. It's really not that expensive.
---
I understand that, I misread and attributed the whole lot of complaints as bannable. That said, a calm pointing that out and the conversation being normal is not what happened. 
---
After calmly stating why camping isn‚Äôt bannable, despite that being the intended topic of conversation or not. This guy sarcastically responded and the comment got downvoted a ton for no apparent reason other than me not throwing killers under the bus.
---
You can buy spirit with shards too ...
---
Enjoy your ban kiddo my dad knows McCote.
---
I made it into a [clean background](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ccbefp/created_a_clean_background_from_unotascammers_post/) if anyone's interested
---
When all of top killers are in the base game/free DLC/unlockable with time, how can a game be p2w? BBQ is the only "essential" killer perk in licensed DLCs.
---
That is just too much work!  I just go to the next lobby XD
---
[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cc7sna/got_disconnected_from_a_game_and_my_wifi_killed/) from u/Not-a-Scammer-

Only exception is face camping and such
---
Could be worse, in spanish he is "El Mayas" or "Bayers".
---
oh right. sorry im a dumbass
---
No matter what you do, there will be someone calling you toxic
---
So just don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
I use it. I think it‚Äôs a good perk
---
You're pathetic.
---
I need it....**I NEED IT!**
---
Do kindergarteners say stuff like weak minded? Lol legit never heard a kid say that.
---
what? what's your definition of "pay to win", if it doesn't take into account the fact that best killers are not in DLC that you have to buy?
---
BBQ isn't essential, it's just a very sweet bonus that would be shitty to not have.
---
Sally doesn't miss him. She's is considering dumping him for a top tier killer.
---
She should have just booked it
---
When you unhook the first guy after 0.3 seconds on the hook, you can be damn sure someone is gonna get camped.

---
Laughs in Star Platinum
---
i read this as it was actually the boat wtf
---
100, it‚Äôs pretty easy to get used to.
---
So the most basic way to explain it is it‚Äôs a fighting game based on three factions knights, Vikings and samurai.  When your in a fight, you have a guard which means there are three areas were you can either attack or block. Main goal is to obviously kill the other person with heavy and light attacks before they kill you. The character in the killer position is called raider and recently a couple months ago he was a really bad character. You couldn‚Äôt kill people that easily. So what the devs did was they reworked him and now he is arguably the best character in the game.
---
:^)
---
Oh i must have missread the thing about pathing sorry, but NOED is a end game perk that CAN BE countered meanwhile there's nothing that can be done about adrenaline, try chainsawing someone with billy while they pop adrenaline, you will be pleasantly surprised. You can't really blame killers who complain about not having enough gen pressure while playing any other killer than nurse,billy and spirit, cause experienced swf's usually win quite easily against them, gens get done in seconds believe me. (it's almost like survivors have the upper hand or something). Some words on NOED: i don't really understand the hate behind it, it's an excelent perk for any killer as a Plan B and don't tell me that it rewards the killer for being shit cause decisive dh bt rewards survivors for being shit.
---
Billy is decision making. do i chainsaw or m1? do i go here or there? granted that goes for a lot of killers but i fell its more for billy
---
You h a v e to do the gens that are right outside the building, keeping the upstairs one is okayish because the killer has to walk up there and you can ditch it quick with the drops. As a general rule of thumb always consider doing middle of the map gens first
---
You beat 3 gen strays by completing a gen and not immediately hoping on the nearest gen.  Cross the map.  See two gens bear each other?  Do one.  Find a different one.
---
This is easy is SWF and hard in solid
---
i was playing around rank 8. these killers were by no means bad i even died to the spirit and leatherface. i just happened to pull off some jukes on them.
---
still waiting for bbq
---
Every gen done makes him weaker and at endgame he's lost all map pressure
---
[Enjoy] (https://youtu.be/OYa5aQb3YGE)
---
Woah, and in the end when it finishes the killer appears a little behind the camera, along with the menu options.
---
Why are you soo emotional?? I 4K without the exploit, it‚Äôs not like you can use it willingly. Resorting to insults shows more about your character.
---
Defeating a sandwich.. Only makes it... Tastier...
---
the auto aim on console honestly fucks me over more than it helps when i‚Äôm playing killer. i‚Äôll land the hit but then it‚Äôll skip a frame and i‚Äôll hit the air.
---
"Guys I just lost a game as Trapper, let's buff I'm and give him the gift of flight!"
---
Well can't say I'm a GOD nurse or a NURSE that will make people quit games but the only thing I can say is use add-ons like less fatigue time and longer range like pinecone or the skinny bottle, don't use only both range or blinks with range, unless you are amazing with these just use pocketwatch and pinecone or even skinny bottle
---
it‚Äôs a temple of time remix lmao

The obssession will get more benefit from Object of Obssession " **As the** [**Killer**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Killer)**'s** [**Obsession**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Obsession) **, this effect applies to a maximum range of** **56/64/72¬†metres. Otherwise, it applies to a maximum range of** **44/56/64¬†metres."** But sole survivor remains the same regardless of being the obsession or not.
---
Thank you bud. Probably my problem was trying her at rank 1 with no add ons or perks.
---
The maths still doesn't support your claim. 0.01% is still too low of a number to claim that the trophy is "easy" to get. If that were the case, people would play the game for an easy platinum.
---
Really? How long have you played the game?
---
Yeah, I think it‚Äôs that one.
---
Not for me
---
Looks like the front door of the Sawyer house from TCM!
---
good killers on consoles can counter them. i‚Äôm in pretty high ranks and i‚Äôm usually able to hit survivors who 360. i do agree that the 30 frames sucks but if i could put console on 60 frames i would.
---
I'm not saying you should throw obsceneties, but what I'm saying is it is completely unfair and it would be right to be furious at a situation like that.
---
Generally speaking, it's going to be hard on you if you set the killer up with a cozy job like that. 
---
In order to beat that, someone needs to be moving on each gennie all the time.  Hag comes, they run until she gives up, then moves right back in to work when she goes after someone else.  Bonus points if last person just runs around blowing all her traps.  If at least 2 gens are consistently getting worked on, you'll eventually break through.  This works less well against nurse and one hit downs.  If the killer can end chases fast, then your best bet is to give up once you give them a tight 3 Gen.
---
But thats the fun part, creating debates and discussions keep the sub alive.
---
If you really want that, go take a look at r/leagueoflegends , they only talk about news of the game and about some popular players occurrences.
---
just throw the controller and you‚Äôll move outta the way, lmao
---
&gt; Also, as I am only rank 12 for both killer and survivor then it is not necessary to analyze the killers at a rank 1 perspective but more a generalized tier list.
---
You can be at r1 playing any killer. It's just easier with some of them. Play a killer you like, and with practice you'll get there.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm only purchasing one more dlc right now
---
I'd say Spirit. She's fun to play and (if it's really important for you) she's very strong (top-3 or even top-2 depending on who you ask)
---
Yeah, it's fine. No DBD works for me.
---
The main problem is the delay from the Xbox controller to the console. Sense all the attacks are so fast you have about 200ths of a second to react to most attacks. In pc The mouse is directly connected to the pc so there is no delay. Something that you have to react to in 200ths of a second on console you can react to within like 300 to 400ths of a second on pc
---
I mean.. What the fuck is the point of writing -rep on someone's profile.
---
Like people look at other people's profiles right before the match, right? Unless they have an interesting name
---
i don‚Äôt really have a good way of explaining it but i know someone did in the comments. i know the camera spinning isn‚Äôt necessary but it‚Äôs a comfort thing for me. thank you!
---
I agree but the thing is it can‚Äôt find you anyone who‚Äôs crouching and isn‚Äôt as precise
---
Billy is much more mobile as well, which is a huge issue for both him and the survivors. He misses, he has to make a quick turn around to try and go for them again. He gets close by, he can M1. He hits, it becomes an instant down.
---
Billy because u can literally dodge his attack simple as that
---
my sensitivity is at a 100 for both survivor and killer. i sometimes make the same mistake especially against bigger killers and ill just run into their hits.
---
So what?
---
Honestly, I seem to be having more success with slugging the one that got rescued and go after the one that did the saving. 
---
That way you occupy 3 survivors, 1 on the ground, 1 being chased and 1 that needs to heal the one on the ground.
---
Too bad if you like the game, but theres others to choose from so dont worry
---
The top tier killers can all be bought by in game currency if you grind. There is only one perk that is meta and behind a paywall: BBQ. And that's also been available twice for purchase with in game currency in the Shrine
---
Yeah, it's easy to counter 360 when you know that lunge have a auto aim, so you just have to step back and lunge, but like, corns give you a massive drop of fps, so 360 in a corn is legit cancer for 30 fps
---
Honestly, it's an old mechanic that no longer has a place in the game as it has evolved.  Imo.
---
i don‚Äôt have a decent camera but i could definitely try but i‚Äôm not sure. i‚Äôd let you know if i did though.
---
wake up is still applied every time you open a gate and highlights it for teammates, not saying it's the best perk, but something like Left Behind won't override it.
---
Remember for Left Behind to even activate, the other 3 survivors have to die, if you're already winning the match or are the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd to die, the perk won't even come into play. It is designed to be a last ditch effort and give you a boost in some way to escape when the odds are stacked against you and everyone else died.
---
Killer can still have knowledge of the hatch beforehand and is still capable of beating you to the hatch, not to mention the killer can still catch you before you even get to a gate, or if you have shitty gate spawns that appear right next to each other.
---
üòê mate it takes too long too do, you‚Äôd be better off just buying the killers and survivors together.
---
Sounds more like he just wants to complain about DLC than a serious answer.
---
Yeah, felt realy like freddy. If the devs gave him his dream powers and fixed shit getting done infront of him he would be fine. It added a learning curve to him due to his invisibility frames in the transition, allowing him to mindgame with them. It was realy satisfying to pull off.
---
i spin like no one else and hope i don‚Äôt die! but you‚Äôre not wrong, it is a bit of a luck game. most good killers will counter 360s and these killers did but i didn‚Äôt want a montage of me getting hit by them.
---
Heavy dwight and Engineer seem okay, but the other two seem a bit OP
---
I am interested, would purchase. Are you making all killers?
---
Run deliverance and DS, guaranted escape
---
If pig got her addons reworked she would be a monster. Nothing in her base kit would need a touch, its already actually quite good.
---
Yes thank you I agree. I‚Äôve heard any killer can work at rank 1 so that‚Äôs part of why I didn‚Äôt want to put emphasis on what‚Äôs the meta at rank 1. 
---
Okay great! I was leaning mostly towards spirit. She seems unique and relatively fun.
---
Do you know if the Freddy rework has made him more viable? 
---
Thanks for your help!

I had a few friends just start up this week. The first thing I told them about this game is it isn't about winning, it's about doing the best you can. You can have an amazing game without even touching a gen. Get out and have some fun.
---
It's pay to get more content, but you can do very well with the free perks and free killers.
---
That's some bullshit. She hits you but the game decides "nah, she fine" and you walk away without being hurt. I know is probably because the game registered the hit on the hooked survivor, but still.
---
If they removed the randomness, everyone would shoot straight for meta perks and be a beast by level 20.
---
what's the point of Engineer? you're just wasting a pallet. why would it be good?

how good is stunning the killer when no one's around? not at all, wasted pallet.

how good is auto-stunning pallet during looping? not at all, the pallet will just waste itself.

So like "i trade you 2 moris for the wraith for your purple flashlight". Could be fun lol
---
I appreciate the sound design for getting bloodweb items. I just wish unlocking an ultra rare didn‚Äôt sound like an epileptic had frantic doggy style sex on top of a piano
---
Can confirm. I'm an achievement hunter, and the grind for rank 1 was absolute hell. I was so salty all the time because all it took was one mistake or some bad luck to yank me further and further away from my goal. The moment I got the achieve, it became a whole new game for me and SO much more relaxing.
---
how do i get that blue thingy next to my name
---
because you lost the game.
---
In league of legends if your team sucks and feed, there isn't a magical way to get a win you don't deserve.
---
Anyways if the killer is very cautious you aren't escaping, its just annoying.
---
Sounds like a good idea to me. Soaring above the map, dropping traps from above...
---
In league of legends (or any team game for that matter), if your team sucks and you lose badly, there isn't a magical way to avoid your loss.
---
End game hatch play is just annoying imo.
---
Just checked steam and the dbd forums and barely saw any complaining within the last 24 hours on steam and 48 hours on the dbd general discussions. I have seen tons of these strawman "survivors mains crying" posts on this sub however.
---
thank you, i‚Äôm glad its at least entertaining.
---
Pretty nice, OP. Keep practicing, though, drawing is an awesome hobby.
---
Not a faster break speed, but rather a single swing at the end of the usual double kick. Like a wind-up at the start.
---
I see your point though.
---
I dunno why but I feel the title would've become the funniest joke ever if you were standing next to a 'keep off the grass' sign.
---
Nonetheless, spot-on cosplays! Love all the work you put into them, they're really well done.
---
Yeah, once you don't have to worry about achievements, fun and memes become what you hunt.
---
Or he can just chainsaw across the map if he doesn‚Äôt like who he‚Äôs chasing and find a new victim... billy is much better than the killers below him
---
If you get always these answers it‚Äôs because...its true?
---
I think that‚Äôs Kara from Detroit: Become Human
---
I think shaming someone through their work is very offensive. Going back to MJ and John K: we don't put "THIS MAN WAS CONVICTED AS A PEDOPHILE" at the start of all of Michael's music videos, or "THE CREATOR OF THIS CARTOON HAS A PERVERTED SUPEREGO" at the start of Ren and Stimpy.
---
You can maybe say that being a Nazi sympathizer is worse than these other two, but that then sets a questional precedent of what is and is socially inacceptable to do.
---
It‚Äôs not hard to press a button multiple times for as long as the entire struggle phase is. If you‚Äôre wearing out keyboards or controllers because of that you‚Äôre probably too hard on them anyways. Making them skill checks makes it even more likely that you‚Äôll fail and die on hook which would just lead to people being mad at BHVR and demanding a revert to the current system. Holding down 1 or 2 buttons/keys isn‚Äôt difficult in any sense of the word and doesn‚Äôt really simulate a ‚Äústruggle‚Äù which is what the second stage of being on the hook is all about. If they did change them to skill checks would madness effect them? Spine chill? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the current struggle mechanic y‚Äôall just want it to be easier when it isn‚Äôt even hard to begin with.
---
Every time a killer drops you, it adds something like 15% to the wiggle progress bar, so when he pressed the drop button, you wiggled off, but it still played the animation of you dropping before you stood up again and stunned him
---
I wasn't outplayed, my team all dropped into a pile at the killers feet and I was in a 1v1 with a closed hatch.
---
The yellow rank survivors chose to play with their red rank buddy, the killer didn't. If they get stomped (getting a red rank killer), it's their fault; if the killer gets stomped (because the system averaged out their levels and the red rank just looped the killer forever), it's not the killer's fault because, again, he didn't have any choice on that.
---
Had this one, too. Picked up last guy, heard a hatch, dropped him on top of it. In the chat got flamed for being toxic :C
---
r/nocontext
---
Lol, give me some creative nerfs xD
---
What I like to do is get the most dangerous ones done early and work out from the centre of the map to keep the last three far from eachother. Naturally it's more difficult solo but it's a good framework.
---
No you
---
Killers are supposed to have tank controls.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be a survivor I would be a killer because the entity would have a easy time turning me into one :/ but I would be spirit
---
Dude, you're the nerd looking THAT deep into my profile and achieves to try and find some holes to poke in what I said. Again, just because you found something hard doesnt mean others couldn't do it. Yeah I got deranged pursuit very shortly after Legion released. It took a few nights of going for ONLY that achieve, and throwing many games in the process. But I got it legit.
---
Killers could actually fly in the early versions of the game
---
Converting offerings to bloodpoints would be great considering I have at least 60 event offering I won't be able to use again.
---
Just look up Identity V. It‚Äôs a DbD reskin. Has some cool skins, though, like Tomie from Junji Ito‚Äôs works.
---
This survivor was in first person, must be a glitch.
---
Nah but great cosplay, looks great &lt;3
---
I play on Xbox, 360‚Äôs aren‚Äôt difficult to counter as long as you have your sensitivity on a reasonable level. Every once in a while I‚Äôll get spun, but it‚Äôs pretty rare
---
Yeah, because your whole attitude is making you seem like a shithead. Pessimism is an unattractive personality trait
---
Yeah, let‚Äôs just keep it at ‚Äúagree to disagree‚Äù because I rather chase a team an entire game then stare in one of them their eyes until the rest escape.
---
And give traps the ability to chase survivors!
---
They record most games they just don‚Äôt use the footage. All though a lot of those people do stream and you can see they do well on the stream. And yes Tru3 is a whiney bitch but he‚Äôs not bad at the game.
---
its your own fault for playing as shirtless david
---
did you really expect the killer to be able to resist the urge to unzip his pants and pleasure himself to that manly body?
---
Well DbD is a game that you can either help you teammates *or* go lone wolf, both are ways to play. Just because teamwork helps doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs required, and you can still escape alone.
---
This isn‚Äôt a moba or a team deatchmatch game, it‚Äôs a survival game.
---
Wait you mean you tell me a perk that punishes you for doing your job is bullshit and unfun 
---
*looks at noed, the perk that punishes you for doing the main objectives instead of wasting your time looking for shit that may or may not even be useful*
---
When you have nothing else of note to say, you will focus on other things like that to save face. W/ever.
---
Yeah I dv'ed you, because you are dv'able. Simple as that. Based on many of your other comments here, others seem to think the same too.
---
9% is not a small speed boost
---
you are talking like anyone gives a shit about points
---
I don't care about points, I care to kill as killer, even if I get 1000 points and depip.
---
And I don't care about escaping as surv, I care about having fun and juking the killer, not doing boring gens and getting points.
---
Also, I am rank 1 in both every season since the release of the game. And as a killer I am going to camp if I see some motherfuckers playing swf wanting a free ride on the festival, because that will make them salty at the end of the game where they will run to the chat to insult.
---
I‚Äôm interested, but I‚Äôm also a bit weary of buying from someone online that isn‚Äôt using a typical marketplace. May I ask why you are choosing not to go through EBay and what form of payment you accept?
---
It would be a fun perk though, useless but fun
---
no it isn t
---
Whenever I come back to play after a break, I'll wiff and survivors think, "oh I don't need to loop, I'll just 360 this noob" then I get my shit together and down people really quick cuz they'll just stay in the same spot and keep trying to 360. I love being underestimated.
---
Try spirit
---
Well of course the choose that. Why would people  not want to play with their friends? 
---
There is no ranked or normal just one mode. You cant seriously expect people to not play with their friends because they are different levels? 
---
&gt;if the killer gets stomped (because the system averaged out their levels and the red rank just looped the killer forever), it's not the killer's fault
---
Yes it is. Dont blindly chase the guy who is clearly better than you. That's something that applies at all ranks and something even rank 1 killers know not to do. Having average killer and 3 average survivors is still so much better than 1 sick killer and 3 average survivors.
---
And yet he doesn't consistently 4k
---
&gt;they just don‚Äôt use the footage.
---
Because they get curb stomped and that's not fun to watch
---
Better prepare for a long shift...
---
‚ÄúJust like a teenager, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.‚Äù ü§î
---
The bloodweb is outdated for sure. If they want to bandaid it, they could just add a third perk to the bloodweb. I feel your frustration.
---
You don‚Äôt have to spin the camera stick. If you‚Äôre spinning clockwise, push cam stick to the right. If you‚Äôre spinning counter clockwise, push cam stick to the left

---
Saw someone else describe it like this on the sub. Think of it like a pair of goggles.  Where the lense would be, that's where GF needs to be to expose him. Being dead center on him, like where your nose would be, doesn't work.  So have your camera slightly to the left or right of him. Once I read that I never have a problem popping him out now.
---
That is not an excuse dude and what if  there is a hidden strat but only with these perks
---
To what u/oogabooga1469 said I had a match where a ghost face camped and tunneled me for like the first 3 gens until I was dead because "I was using crutch perks" funny thing is he used noed (I try to start cleansing dull totems when I see them and hunt for them with 2 gens left if we at least 3 people)
---
depends who are you camping.
---
I'ts more funny to see a swf scream post-game on the chat and namecalling because you dared to kill one of them instead of giving them a free unhook than just chasing shadows and see 4 escaping because they are breaking the game rules with voice and crutch perks
---
Look at my above comment. His reveal area on your screen is slightly to the left or right of him.
---
Your missing my point, and don‚Äôt even know that it was an exaggeration. It‚Äôs stupid and unrealistic too grind out shards too get killers for free. That is my point.
---
It probably comes across as bragging to people that can't manage to do that, but I can assure you that it is not bragging. Perhaps people that are doing well should just never open their mouth about their state of life, in case it comes across as bragging.
---
And you know you are out of things when you try you act condescending with conparisons to teenagers and insults like "immature".
---
I think I am quite done arguing with the housewife that used to strip for a living, rofl
---
I like the new Freddy rework, it launches him from f tier up to about a B or A. He‚Äôs good but there are a lot of ways to counter him.
---
Meyers
---
I‚Äôm still pretty noob at this game but play a lot of killer and whenever I manage to kill 3 I‚Äôll let the last one go, especially if they‚Äôve gave me the run around or I‚Äôve seen them save their teammates etc.
---
Usually I‚Äôll message them so we can look for the hatch together, people are often hesitant and think I‚Äôm trying to bait them out though which is understandable, once they realise I‚Äôm being for real though I always get a happy thank you message afterwards and it makes for a nice refreshing end after the tense chase and murdering beforehand

---
I wish they were bankable but I haven't seen anything done. 
---
I have been threatened by survivors with hacking my profile and IP/location knowledge (literally my first ever game as killer level 20  using level 1 Hillbilly after the guy I was going to hook disconnected and had his whole group of friends find my profile and coordinate message me at the same exact time) thid made me question what kind of game did i just buy if I'm going to be threatened. I have been berated, harassed,I have had angry survivors attack me for even using certain killers, I have had killers message me after triumph just to dig in more that I should delete my game and that I'm trash. Just because i died in that game. I have had survivors quit on me and leave me with 4-5 gens left because the killer was nurse and I couldn't find a hatch before she blinked to me. I have had survivors quit on me the moment I drop them or before I get them on hook or before they die on hook (which I found out the game doesn't count a hook death until the sacrifice completes and the hook breaks).
---
None of these actions have been bannable. 
---
The ONLY thing I have had done was the guy who got his 10 or so friends to message threats to me change his name. 
---
But Xbox doesn't report anonymously I also found out (been gameing on Xbox for over 10 years now and never reported anyone) so I never got the other guys who threatened me reported in the event they could actually do something to my account or, worse case, safety.
---
BHVR, hire this person!
---
I‚Äôve only played a few killers myself so I can‚Äôt speak from tons of experience, but from what I know Billy, Spirit, and Nurse are pretty comfy sitting around the top tier, Ghostface is fairly strong as well. Legion and Freddy are lower tier and most other killers can be ‚Äòokay‚Äô with the right builds
---
And her cow
---
Something as simple as that would help a lot, yeah
---
Such a gentleman
---

The games been out 3 years of course there is a lot of dlc. The games only 20 to begin with
---
IT STILL SUCKS EVEN THO IT IS NOT 100% CLEAR P2W
---
You *can* technically get everything but the licensed killers, however it‚Äôs going to take you a fucking lifetime to do so. 9000~ iridescent for one killer or survivor, and you don‚Äôt exactly get those things together very quickly.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù perse, but a lot of potential fun  content to play is sort of locked behind a pay wall or at least a really-long-grind wall.

It's unlikely but I do really wish this was the case. I did a [survey](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c72j0e/survey_results_the_worst_perks_in_dead_by_daylight/) of what people's least desirable perks were and Left Behind was the worst Survivor perk according to the votes. Bill's other two perks are great too it's just Left Behind that no one likes.

Nah Billy is still far better than Myers even in console. Yeah the chainsaws are a little harder to hit due to frames, survivors spin better with joysticks, and using a controller but regardless of that his map pressure &amp; mobility is incredibly useful in creating pressure. All it takes is for Myers to mistime a tier 3 and he‚Äôll get looped and pressure gone
---

---
So... You've got a lot of options. That makes it easier actually...
---
Maybe we should start a petition?
---
The Huntress = The Female Hunter
---
I think it‚Äôs more than 15, cause if the survivor is wiggling it takes 3 drops for them to go on foot, 4 if they don‚Äôt wiggle at all
---
&gt; Buying, selling and trading ***of any kind*** is prohibited
---
Yeah no shit. It's supposed to sound sketchy lmao
---
Because i asked a question? 300 iq right here high change of virgin neckbeard
---
Help this baby survivors join the real game :) it's good that better players get matched with slightly lower players so they can learn. Soon there may be so little people playing that rank matchmaking may be turned off :P
---
If heavyweight were to decrease the speed more than 3%, killers might just give up and go for slugging. I think the perk would give a chance to wiggle off.
---
I have constantly said there needs to be a nerf to something killer based of camping the perimeter of a hooked survivor and a buff to all survivors on gens insuring the game keeps moving forward and the killer is penalised for staying in proximity to a hooked survivor over a period of time just to get 1ckill. I know there's a score penalty on the killer for being too close to a hooked survivor, which stacks against the positive points for your actions. 
---
 
---
I also agree that if everyone is rushing for the hook save, you should be allowed to attack back and it not being "camping".
---
Where else will I go? A gen not being worked on so the 3 flashlight warriors can run in and save their hooked friend and I'll just wait at that dead gen until they are healed and running so i can attack again? Bull.
---
&gt;Why would people not want to play with their friends?
---
I didn't say otherwise.
---
&gt;There is no ranked or normal just one mode.
---
Which is ranked.
---
&gt;You cant seriously expect people to not play with their friends because they are different levels? 
---
I don't expect it, but nothing more fair than balancing it towards the highest rank survivor. It's you who's choosing to play it that way, I'm talking about the whole "isn't fair to have 3 low levels going against a higher level killer". Yeah, it is, simply because you chose that. What isn't fair is having a killer going against a higher level survivor just because, again, the survivors chose it. I hope I'm being clear with that.
---
&gt;Yes it is. Dont blindly chase the guy who is clearly better than you.
---
That's something me and you know, but lower ranks don't. Isn't simply about loops, they'll think they can get him then he'll just 360¬∞ them (I'm playing on console, so that's even more effective due to frame drops), or dead hard them (and they don't even know what just happened) or just juke them. I know this gets a bit less problematic the higher the killer's rank, but I've seen my fair share of rank 18 killers (myself included when I started out) going against a red rank to advocate that the balance should occur towards the highest rank survivor.
---
How do you keep your 360s so wide? Also what rank are you playing at.
---
&gt;Hey mom can I have Dead by Daylight?
---
Serious moment though this is probably why they're making a mobile version of DBD: they need more grounds to sue people who make shovelware like this.

Lol ok dude

Possible Solutions to Left Behind Perk:
---
--Allow Bill to have a perk that lets him open the hatch back up. Now.. hear me out on this one.. It wouldn‚Äôt be instantaneous. It would be very comparable to repairing a generator or opening an exit gate. It would be a timegated process. This would put pressure on the killer to check three exit points, rather than two and give bill some end-game last man standing play (Which is what the perk was suppose to be). 
---
--Alternatively, you could have his last perk still be left behind but instead of it not activating until the end game, its based off of the number of survivors alive. So, if all survivors are alive, it is not active. If one survivor dies, he gets X amount of speed increase to gens. If two die, the X increases even more. Seeing the odds dwindle as his comrades drop, he works more efficiently trying to save those who remain. That sort of thing. 
---
--Another idea would be to just completely eliminate that perk all together and make something totally new.
---
*DON'T LET ME SEE YOU ON MY EARTH AGAIN, VIRGINIA*
---
That's a huge risk though. You could travel to the other side of the map and nobody would be there
---
Yeah Steam consider the time spent with the launcher open so with WF it's kinda easy. I have 5k hours because I often forgot to close the launcher after I open it just to update.
---
This sub is 5% people complaining about nerfs and 95% people complaining about the complainer.
---
You maybe right... if im playing against rank 20 killer and the other survivors 5 and they are trash talking him. I always try to explain how they can improve there games.  It's very frustrating when im playing with new survivors and  rank 9 killer. It happens too. im aleways trying to stay positive tho
---
Xbox
---
360ing for me is predicting when the killer is going to hit, in most of these i start spinning before they even swing. i cant really explain but it‚Äôs a matter of not thinking of it as just a fancy spin and actually physically moving out of the way of the killer. i‚Äôm playing around rank 7-8 but i keep getting black or negative pips even if i do 3 gens and never get hit by the killer.
---
Every game ever
---
Ah yes the classic Dead Hard into the wall lol. I can see how it can be optimally used like how you described it. It's just a rare sight to see people not dash into a wall or dash before the swing.
---
Yeah, but you know you want to.
---
I haven't got a 4K yet, thats prob cuz i just got DbD 2 days ago.
---
The way I see it, they‚Äôre using those perks/addons in place of ones that would help them stay alive in chases/lose the killer/help teammates, etc. It‚Äôs still annoying but it‚Äôs a trade off.
---
I agree?
---
Combat straps should be part of pig‚Äôs base kit
---
Exposing him is easy. Just try _not_ to expose him so as to avoid revealing your location. Works everytime.
---
I really love Nea, but damn those bangs need a quick lil revisit.
---
Why would they ever nerf wraith xD
---
auto aim is the enemy of the 360, but i don‚Äôt mind it because i play both sides in fairly decent ranks and i think auto aim screws me over when playing killler more than it helps me
---
If I even see scratch marks, faded or especially bright, around the hook I just used, I will check the vicinity. Call it camping if you want, I call it hunting at that point.
---
Ye but you act like choosing to play with there Higher level friend is a tactical move. I get your point. It's not complicated I am just disagreeing with you. Choosing to play with your higher friend is just that. Its just playing with your friend. Most swf are just chatting while playing the game. They ain't ruinng strats and tactics. Just playing a game with friends. They shouldn't be punished with red rank killers just because they "choose" to play with friends. Not choosing to play with a red rank not choosing to be a dick just choosing to play with friends. 
---
No one is disagreeing that a low rank killer going against a rank 1 is fair. I am arguing that it is more fair then having a red rank killer. 
---
As far as low rank players not knowing that
---
 Well tbh tough shit. I had to learn it by getting my ass looped. As did you as will they. Everyone learns by getting destroyed. It's part of every game ever.  There is however fuck all to be learnt from a rank 1 nurse omega blinking 3 yellow survivors.
---
Thanks for the response, I‚Äôll be trying that strategy.

Spent 20 min yesterday with a Claudette waiting for a David to stop hiding in a locker, she was DOH and he hadn't been seen since the start of the game
---
Claudette kept trying for gens and I kept downing her and walking away waiting for the David, went far away so they could start on gens and I could finish them, coming back and once again finding only Claudette.
---
Found him upstairs eventually, gave Claudette the hatch, that dickhead was just waiting to scurry off on his own.
---
Thing is a player DC'd at the start so I was gonna leave the last one alive anyways, which would've been him had he not abandoned his team

---
That's a very fair point. I'll put my shirt back on.
---
If you‚Äôre not using Hope, you‚Äôre a dope.
---
just be wary of what gens are being completed, this comes down to map knowledge and knowing where gens spawn. There are perks like Detective's Hunch and Deja Vu to help letting you know where gens are if you need them as well as the Map item which tracks all gens you run by on it (along with other stuff should you use add-ons or use the UR Map). Generally speaking you want to get the gens either in the middle of a map or switch between sides of the map to ensure there's always going to be gens far away from each other.
---
Though this can't always be in your control since other survivors are (hopefully) doing gens as well, a good practice is if you see people doing gens in a certain portion of the map, it's a good idea to go to another and do gens there.
---
No problem! Just be mindful of when the killer is occupied and you should have no issue getting those unsafe gens done. Perks like spine chill, alert, empathy, and bond are all fantastic information gathering perks for when you're playing solo and attempting to do gens safely.
---
From me going for the adept achievements I‚Äôve figured out these tips if you‚Äôre interested:
---
Hook people and walk away within 10 seconds. You lose points camping a hook while not in a chase and especially if no survivors within 16 metres. So hook and walk away and start damaging gens or chasing other survivors. You want the person to get off the hook so you can hook at least 9 times in a game. You don‚Äôt want them afraid you‚Äôre camping and leaving the survivor to die or struggle. This also makes DCs less of an issue.
---
You lose points, especially in early game for survivors doing gens. Damage gens as much as possible early game, I‚Äôve even let survivors go after I hit them once to go and damage gen. You also get bonus points at end of match for gens never completed.
---
Chasing- end chases quickly and they have to result in a hit, if someone is looping you just leave and monitor gens to find others.
---
Try not to use insta down killer abilities. As Michael I didn‚Äôt tier up so I could get a hit in before downing then. You lose points if the survivors heal so run around a lot and don‚Äôt spend too much time on one survivor. 
---
The legion ability deep wound cuts gives lots of points and seems easy to pip.

I‚Äôve noticed at high number ranks 17-20 the requirements for getting iridescent are more lax. More detail on emblems [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8bvz68/emblems_explained_the_eli5_version/) 
---
At rank 17 I was able to get adept legion my first time playing legion and I didn‚Äôt get a 4K. The last survivor escaped through hatch. I posted about it being a pleasant surprise that I got it without 4K but people were upset I was ‚Äúbragging‚Äù at such high number rank and mod took it down because any picture with emblem screen is ‚Äúover-saturation‚Äù. Whoops
---
Its still nice that you aknowledged  that David didnt do anything and that u let the Claudette get the hatch
---
one of the easiest ones to do though, I'd rather get that than "land 4 stealth attacks with the pig"
---
Putting aside the fact that BBQ is a near staple perk of most killers, usually things *are* supposed to be a large risk with dbd. There are perks that help your tracking, which helps your tp.
---
It's the same with Nurse and Billy. You could use your power to go to the otherside of the map and maybe no one will be there. But their powers have a short cooldown? Well, Freddy has a second, equally powerful power built that helps him in other areas.
---
Cosplay?
---
Or if you have BBQ and literally no aura shows up and the gens re other side of map. It‚Äôs just kind of like well, I know you are here, I‚Äôm not leaving lol.
---
I think Jane Romero screams louder
---
YES! Exactly. I SWF all the time and we aren't toxic players at all.
---
Loved that video lol
---
It‚Äôs because of the fact that it takes 4 survivors to every 1 killer.  It‚Äôs those odds that make it difficult to get faster queue times
---
I'm complaining about it. I'm just not complaining that it's OP or needs to get nerfed. I just think it's a hot mess that's annoying to play against.
---
Fall asleep every minute? Ick. Except it doesn't actually do anything, so who cares? There are two alarm clocks, but only one works at a time, and there's no indication of this except the aura at a distance. WTF? But again, being asleep doesn't really matter anymore, so why would I bother running all the way to a clock? And you can see and be hit by Freddy all the time even though he's supposed to be a dream demon. What bullshit.
---
Freddy wasn't broken before, just slightly underpowered. He needed tweaks, not to have his entire identity wiped away and replaced with some kind of weird hag variant.
---
Unpopular opinion, I know. Go ahead. Downvote away. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I'm on the same boat, would love to have one but also a bit weary. Will think about it for a little bit.
---
have the same problem but i'm the killer 
---
its doesnt really feel like an achievement to win and i really feel bad for them because many ranks 20 are new and i just ruined the fun to them
---
hopefully it will be addressed and changed
---
What does the key do anyway? I have one and the description leaves much to the imagination
---
Does she ship them worldwide?

---
This chat was before the bug happened, but if that were to happen then I would understand
---
*eats orphan*
---
Camping isnt a reportable offense. Neither is tunneling or dribbling.
---
When a full team brings in 4 toolboxes and gen speed perks to end the match as fast as possible, thats genrush. People choosing to sit on the objective when injured is not that. I've seen too many people be completely unable to do anything when they are injured, that gives the killer an easy 4k.
---
Now that's a twist
---
I get your point. I know that not all SWF is a bunch of tryhards, but the way I see it, there's only two options: either the survivors get a high level killer, or the killer gets a high level survivor. By picking the first option, the survivors have the option of simply not playing SWF if they don't want to get a high level killer (or doing it anyway and, just as *you* said, learning through getting their asses kicked). By picking the second option, the killer, who had no choice in the matter, gets punished by having to play against a higher rank survivor. Even if he still manages to get the other 3, this is still blatantly unfair against him simply because he had no choice on that and still got punished for not having a fair chance to get his 4k.
---
&gt;They shouldn't be punished with red rank killers just because they "choose" to play with friends.
---
Yes, they should. I get the whole "they want to play with their friend, not with a higher rank player", but not only this isn't true for 100% of the cases, still, by the end of the day, the other player is a red rank before being their friend both for the killer and for the game. I'm not even getting into the whole communication part, which is a **huge** advantage, even if they're not communicating their positions and etc 100% of the time. 
---
&gt;I am arguing that it is more fair then having a red rank killer. 
---
Which is not because, again, one party had a choice to simply not play it that way, the other didn't. If one of the parties gets to face a higher rank player, is just the consequence of their choice, if it's the other way around, is someone getting punished without doing anything because some other people decided to play with their friends. And don't come to me with the whole "so, people shouldn't be allowed to play with their friends" entitled thing, they can very well do it, but there's simply a fair and an unfair way of doing it.
---
Oh that's just farming, I'm not sure but I think you can report ppl for that.
---
As annoying as it is, it's not at all a bannable offence.  The devs have said so many times.
---
the fast ones on the right side of the circle are a nightmare
---
I play custom games with them a lot and the only characters they don't want me to play are Freddy and The Pig
---
It allows you to open the hatch before the requirements are met.
---
holy shit dude ,that what it is ,i got really nostalgic when i heard it and could'nt understand why 
---
damn this music just dropped massive nostalgia on me
---
Unfortunately there isn‚Äôt anything you can do about face campers. The developers came out a while back and said that it was a legit strategy. The only thing you can do to counter a face camper is essentially have the other survivors split up and do 3 gens at once for a gen rush. Then the killer will get a very low score and hurt their rank. It sucks but if they face camp and everyone comes to save then the killer ends up scoring very well and ranks up for him camping the whole time
---
But it's not like playing killer against SWF is THAT bad unless they're stacking toxic stuff like bnps or insta-medis and do gens in a smart order

Find those nice windows that don't have a door necessarily RIGHT next to it, and loop between that and nearby pallet. If you can't find one, or a long loop with a pallet, keep trying to break LOS and vault windows you think will get you a tiny bit extra distance (but only fast vault)
---
Survivor mains are like hey man, if you don‚Äôt about face, walk to the other end of the map and dc. You are area camping. And that‚Äôs heinous, and bannable. This subreddit is the best example of the mentality that most survivors have lol

to be fair, LF chainsaw is a thing to learn too.

but yes, i like to insidiouscamp the tbag bois and last second switchers.

Welp if you say so. I will try to improve myself to not get hit then. Thanks for the reply!
---
You're faster than nurse without it, and you're almost as fast as huntress had and spirit with it
---
Something I saw in a stream was Freddy chasing a survivor who was running in the direction of a generator, Freddy would teleport to the gen and cut the survivor off as they're still running away. That's pretty cool.
---
So how would you react if you lost because of some speed hacking, flashlight spamming survivor? Or a lag switching, teleporting, face camping killer?

Yes she has one for nurse, what I dont know is if she has any nurse in stock.

I'd have to see the gameplay from both perspectives because there was a time where I did actually go up against a wall hax killer. So I can't say for sure who's really telling the truth.
---
Still not worth it

*Drinks Vomit*

They don‚Äôt make ‚Äòem like they used to...
---
Nothing a good mallet can't fix

If there are multiple survivors nearby, not a long one, maybe 30/25/20 seconds
---
Left Behind activates when you‚Äôre the only person left. Also, once the hatch is closed, you‚Äôve screwed yourself

Always be tapping your chainsaw, ready to rev. Getting up close to them is real good. Also, he isn‚Äôt the worst killer on lerys or the game. You can still chainsaw people through windows.

The only genuinely skilled bubba main I've met is a girl on my gfs friends list, she made it to rank 1 with bubba and doesn't use noed or bbq, makes it a point to never tunnel, and every time I've tried kyf with her as the killer I get absolutely slaughtered.
---
With that being said, most bubba's are indeed insideous campers lol
---
Self-Care is not terrible by itself. 
---
However, Self-Caring against a Sloppy Butcher Legion is *dumb*. 
---
As a rank 3 killer, I stopped running Sloppy Butcher on Legion as survivors never heal against me cause they are capable loopers and their time is better spent on generators.
---
You know that whenever they reach for the "your hacking" card , they had no valid point to begin with
---
More like MacMillan
---
I really don't understand where this crying for how BHVR always nerfs killers comes from, they've been buffing killers a lot more and making changes where necessary. The only 2 instances I can think of that was a hard nonsensical nerf was Freddy a couple weeks after release and that weird flashlight stun change they did a long time ago that lasted like a week because of the outrage.
---
Anything else has just been small needed tweaks or typically in favour of killers. Unless people want to call whatever Legion was on release fine. Clown is a decent anti-loop killer, Spirit is one of the strongest killers we have, Plague is still up there, Ghost Face is an OK mid tier killer, and they are now entirely reworking Freddy. They are now tackling really safe loops and redesigning how they function with the new Badham and are going to start going down the list for all maps in this way. If they do redesign loops this way, this will make like half the killer cast much more viable. If I'm not mistaken they are also looking at redesigning add-ons for a lot of the killers to either be more potent or add more variables on how they play which can be seen as killer reworks themselves.
---
I'm sorry but I can't possibly see where this mentality comes from of "BHVR only cares about rank 20 survivors and hates their killer community!"
---
Devotion level zero.
---
I had a stroke trying to read this one

Yeah they reproduce asexually so it probably doesn‚Äôt but I mean the Mind Flayer is an eldrich horror being and Will still refers to it as ‚Äúhim‚Äù

It annoys me so much when they missspell his name. It's M-y-e-r-s and by god, it really isnt that hard

Sure

GhostFace next pretty please? : 3
---
Most of the time I do this to the last survivor as a way for me to say congratulations you are a good survivor. However if they teabag me they are sentenced to the hook
---
It's your friendly survivor mains ordering a few extra pallets :)
---
Literally have a friend writing his name like that. Unironically.
---
interesting seeing a clearer view of her face
---
This is a simple statement of fact that I believe a lot of people forget.
---
So civilized
---
Outplayed by big brain killer
---
but....it looks way worse...
---
Actually that's kinda what I was thinking of, making an inverse of Thanatophobia (but with actually good stats for it) since Thana doesn't affect dead survivors I figured Dying Light could fill that spot
---
Same thought here
---
Ps4 Europe: algiuz
---
Just looking for decent people, no mics needed.
---
Whispers is going off but I'll just walk away
---
So i now understand this is a very specific situation (sloppy butcher, legion). But as a more general rule, i do think self caring is usually worth it. I actually get annoyed when my teammates refuse to get healed, especially if they are dead on hook.
---
* First they deny me precious altruism points
---
* Second, their next chase is gonna be close, which will mean less evader points for them.
---
* Third, they have less chance to espace, which might mean less survival points for them.
---
There are definitely times where self caring is bad thought, and your situation seems to be one of them.
---
I remember a game where i played huntress and destroyed a swf (feelsgood), but i kinda felt bad for the Bill because you could clearly see that he's done with life. I gave him the hatch, just so he can insult me and my mother.
---
Nah bro killer stresses me the fuck out. I dont play it much at all anymore since apex came out. Now i play survivor with my friends.
---
Xbox queue times are ridiculous man , my average times for killer games are 7-9 mins but with survivor it's almost instantaneously in a solo queue
---
Well I imagine I wouldn't be too happy but I've never had to deal with that on PS4 yet.
---
Best way I can explain it is that this is a videogame not a real life simulator of someone being a killer chasing unlucky survivors. What I mean is as it is a video game the Human Bean behind the game starts the game to have fun and play so when you face someone who is exploiting the poor balance, ie. camping, to get their win it will ruin the game for the other person as they have no chance. So yea some people could argue 'its the point of the game and I am supposed to be a killer' but the difference from this and a horror film is the survivor chose to play and participate so they can just as easily leave. Poor analogy lol but simply put if the game isn't fun for both sides then sooner or later people will stop playing one side theirfore the other side can't play either. 
---
From a gaming sense have you ever played an old school FPS online were they hadn't thought hard enough about spawncamping? You get that one guy who will sit in the right spot with the right weapon and eradicate people as they spawn. Technically he is doing what he is supposed to do in getting kills to win but its not the way the game was intended to be played and their is no skill or element of fairness to that.
---
Sorry if I make no sense lol
---
Dont try to pull a scarecrow falasy into this. I play killer but probably 1 out of every 10 survivor games even at that. Its too stressful for me compared to survivor and i cant play wigh my friends as a killer.
---
Nice job, l see you‚Äôre spending your bp wisely üòâ
---
Ok true I didn‚Äôt know if you meant like you turn it up because you like it or because it‚Äôs loud haha
---
Why so i not remember that episode
---
Alright, thanks üëç
---
Plague got the ancient gear from BOTW
---
This is actually distressing af
---
It‚Äôs the one on Soos‚Äô birthday where they go to the laser tag place
---
Even in those situations though I still feel as though you should just move on. Case and point i played against a well coordinated SWF two days ago as doctor. I was basically crushed and got 1 kill. I just took it as a "Hey, you got outplayed, but learn from it and move on, you'll get better."
---
That's the gayest thing I've ever read.
---
I know loads of people who mostly play swf. And it‚Äòs the same on every plattform, but they announced that with dedicated servers it will be changed.
---
Am i the only one the has to mute when im leveling up?ü§£
---
I'm sure the prefered ideal is killers don't use location awareness perks but survivors can run Kindred, Dark Sense, etc
---
Damn... I really have to watch Gravity Falls again
---
Except for tier 3 Myers üëâüëâ
---
Left behind = slowly reopen hatch. 
---
Self care = medkit 
---
Head-on= flashlight
---
Saboteur = toolbox
---
Left behind = key
---
It would be an insult to us if he was nerfed
---
Yes and No. It's always a good tracking perk, one of my favourite perks, but you wont get the jump on players ever when using it
---
165
---
Even before the gens are done and when there are still people alive?
---
My queue time on killer ps4 is 2 mins max rabk 12

Joseph Joestar is disappointed

Open 1 exit gate as David King, against a 5 blink ebony Mori nurse, and 3 Disconnected teammates.

Every. Fucking. Time.

Im usually against NOED, but if she didn‚Äôt hit anyone before all gens were done, you guys fucked up by not doing totems. You easily could have cleansed.

I agree. If survivors got a buff (they need a buff they keep nerfing survivors and buffing killers), and made an option to opt in or out of swf groups it would be way better imo.

yes

Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time....

Don't stop me now, because im having a good time...

I'm a sharpened claw, carving through your neck like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity...I'm a nightmare passing by like Claudette the survivor, I'm gonna kill, kill, kill, theres no stopping me...
---
I'm carving through your skin yeaaah....
---
Exactly. I run DS and adrenaline. So I would have no right to get mad at a killer for running bbq or noed even if I wanted to. I‚Äôm using perks to help me survive and they‚Äôre running shit to help them kill it‚Äôs the whole premise of the game and why these perks are in the game.
---
I agree with you.
---
The problem for me, it's the people cheating. and for me cheating is SWF with mic.
---
That breaks the game, any other thing is in the design, but not that.
---
Couple goals
---
nerf frickin dageas whard so that when they dash they get downed cause this stupid David just jukes me with a FRICKING DEAD HATD!!!‚Äônananahenene
---
If I were to roughly guess, I'd say less than 15 hours are idle hours
---
And about 60-100 spent in queues (totally joking... right?)
---
While they're micropenis trashcans for doing it, unfortunately it is not against any rules so it is part of the game.  Best advice I can give you is play to punish that shit.  Focus on learning how to properly loop pallets, windows buildings, etc...run Decsisive, Adrenaline and Dead Hard.  All hurt pretty badly against camping and tunneling particularly Decisive post rework.  And if one of your teamates is being facecamped just crank out gens the whole time.
---
The hatch spawns when there are enough gems done. So basically you need to do (number of survivors alive +1 gen). So if 2 survivors alive you need to do 2+1=3 gens.
---
Technically you didn't win because you didn't teabag
---
But no one really runs the same 4 perks at higher levels anyway. There's a good number of decent perks on both sides
---
The only perk that's pretty much required is Ruin, so I'm still not seeing a difference other than people would have access to decent perks earlier on
---
Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!
---
this picture cracks me up I‚Äôm making a new photo album
---
Most time the killer closes the hatch anyway anyway.
---
Thats fine too. But thats not what Im talking about. Im talking about the swf 4q that brings one deranked player so they can play against a killer not nearly close to their skill level, then tbag and flash light spam the entire game, then decide to be a holes in chat
---
&lt;3
---
I could see that yeah, but most of the time I go really easy on them and will try and injure all of them before downing them but I could still see that being an issue
---
She‚Äôs gonna become the new Nurse
---
I think you confused boil over and dance with me, Dance With Me removes your scratch marks for 3 seconds after vaulting a window or pallet while Boil Over is the one that increases you struggle affect on the killer. Otherwise, very good changes and I‚Äôd love to see most of these reworks implemented
---
I was coming on here to make some witty comment it seems I'm too late
---
I see why coming from your user flair
---
I don‚Äôt get it.
---
What song is this?
---
I skipped that goal because you can't complete them all without making more purchases. I got the game for free through PSPlus and got my platinum and am happy with that.
---
wot
---
Camping is so boring and dry and hurts everyone‚Äôs ability to rank and gain points. The only reason a killer should be camping is if a terrible teammate is looping them around your hook. Play the game, leave the hook, get your damn points.
---
Would love for auto aim to do that and not just whip my camera around into a wall instead.
---
That's just being a developer in general üòì
---
Having exactly what you want all the time kinda takes away some of the challenge.  I don't like having to grab shit like Hangman's Trick on my killers, but if I had rank 3 Ruin at level 3 with every single killer that would be kinda goofy.
---
Wow i have just about 9k shards rn, totalt buying jesus when i get in the game again just for the memes
---
I‚Äôm gonna get my flashlight you fool
---
Spirit and nurse are the vets at rank one but as you want stealth pig/Myers
---
Here is the thing: nobody is supposed to win every game. Rng, maps, perks, add-ons, etc. can influence things.
---
If it's worthy enough to share, I clip it
---
Then in that case, yeah, you have every right to be angry, but I don't think you should hurl obscenities¬† and such at them. Just move on, but if they engage you in chat then talk back. That's what I always do. I don't ever trash talk and in my 1 year and 9 months of playing DBD I am actually kind of proud of the fact that I've never sent any sort of hate message and I've also never purposely DC'd when things weren't going my way. But I understand why people do.
---
Call me a salty killer but these jukes are just dumb. Like, they look dumb, the survivor looks like a headless cockroach
---
To be honest they should rework it so if all other 3 survivors escape you have immunity from getting downed once (like OLD MoM) as long as you get 3 hook rescued / gems finished
---
Did you break any bones making that stretch?
---
Unless you were toxic all game.         
---
Then a Mori ON the hatch
---
That'd be a possibility, especially if he had more traps on hand to begin with.
---
You're gonna end up with that anyway, why should you shift through the pile of trash first?
---
It's not fun having to grab all the shit I'm literally never going to use just to find something I want. 
---
I'm not even saying have rank 3 right away, just rank 1 would do. Adding more perks to grab. Something, anything.
---
The system needs a rework
---
Eh, a quick "fuck you" or "toxic piece of shit" gives some level of satisfaction. Normally I'm with you, but if they aren't budging its harmless.
---
Tbh auto aim fucks me up more than it helps against 360.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call Legion or pre-work Freddy midtier, other than that I agree with you on the rankings.
---
What gets me is when you get double tapped.  Get a skillcheck, take a second to adjust yourself, move camera to keep an eye out for the killer, and wipe your bro.... shit.
---
Me
---
This I did not know, may help explain a bit
---
I‚Äôve played for approx 250 hours and level 50ed most of my killers keep grinding mate!
---
‚Äúmommy they don‚Äôt wike me so i am going to be a jerk to them and call them a filthy survivor main!‚Äù
---
(you‚Äôre aware this sub is mostly killer mains being more active, right)
---
Lol, I had a game where there were 3 gen setup, and it went from 4 living, to 3 dead and one escape through hatch!
---
swf is a noooo for me
---
It's suppose to be not fun and uncomfortable, it's called "Struggle" for something
---
Spoiler alert thank you :)
---
I believe they've made all ini edits that can give an advantage non-editable.  Anything that's left should be fair game.
---
You would be right but looking at it side by side they look way to similar
---
Can you stop posting this
---
I agree
---
Hex: Sleep Ruined
---
With all due respect if survivors were complaining about Freddy as much as you claim we wouldn't have to go anywhere.  It would be right here on this sub.
---
LMAO but I wonder if she gets increased damage against survivor ‚Äùguardians ‚Äúof hooks
---
1400 here.  I still can‚Äôt get past rank 9 lol
---
No, I‚Äôm not taking the L on anything lol. Explaining my point without sarcasm or obnoxious PAL statements is not a problem unless it‚Äôs made out to be one by illogical people. 
---
He purposefully uses an unnecessary sarcastic description at the end very obviously driving home that he wasn‚Äôt intending it to be simply a ‚Äúhey you misconstrued the context‚Äù 
---
The fact so many people ‚Äúless than 20‚Äù downvoted a comment proves nothing on the survivor majority subreddit and purely proves the point of the meme post this whole conversation is taking place under. I‚Äôll say it again, camping isn‚Äôt bannable, survivors should get over it and the context of this conversation is just going way pst the necessary limits anyway. 
---
This subreddit is so toxic and biased and it becomes impossible to have a discussion either way without people getting out of shape immediately as demonstrated by the immediate sarcastic reply to a comment that simply is explaining why something is the way it is, regardless of initial context I‚Äôm allowed to explain anything want on any post anywhere. Deal with it and take the L man
---
One of the legion
---
I got scared for a second thought that was me lmao
---
This is pretty well agreed upon, some of the moris are just pathetic
---
yeah it really does, it‚Äôs better to just hope you get a hit on them than rely on auto-aim
---
I can see your a toxic killer man, you didn't even think to give them their ebony key in the revolver's chamber.
---
When I heard that time traveler character speak for the first time I went, "Holy shit, is that Morty?" Talk about a role.
---
I jut pee my pant
---
Nope that would be bullshit because then you could trap up every possible access to the basement to screw survivors but still be able to get in and out effortlessly yourself.  On basement builds this would be unfair.
---
Lmao ima trade all my survivor stuff for spirit moris
---
If these get put on Etsy or elsewhere I will happily buy one! So cute!
---
If that's the case we should get behaviour told that we want new ones. I don't care if they're monatised, as long as we get better ones. I'd happily pay 300-500 cells to get a much more brutal Mori animation.
---
‚ÄúWould you like to hook this survivor? $2.99 for Yes, $5.99 for No‚Äù
---
Oh yeah there were multiple
---
I don't understand. What's the difference between Quentin and Feng?
---
I feel like one of the bigger problems is that somewhere along the way Survivors started expecting to bully every killer every game, Killers started expecting to 4K double pip every game, and they both started caring more about rank and BP instead of *having fun*.
---
I barely play Killer so no comment on playing against Survivors, but I miss fearing the Killer. I‚Äôm happy to see them actually having some power behind them now. Just because you died/had a shitty game doesn‚Äôt something was broken.
---
I agree. It's definitely an untapped area for them
---
i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre salty lol. as a killer main i do agree when a survivor 360s they look stupid.
---
Yes, lots of politics about a game where kidnapped supernatural killers hunt kidnapped fictional people to sacrifice them to a spider god who feeds on emotions. 
---
Obviously a critique of the horrors of capitalism in third world countries under the near fascist regime of Trump from the point of view of a urban college educated man in his mid twenties.
---
I don't play nurse, spirit, or Billy. My fastest killer is either the doctor or wraith. I think I'm screwed.
---
I'll take Lery's for my Billy over the Game for my Trapper any day of the week.
---
Legion can be tricky, frenzy mode clouds the vision just enough. 
---
Once you get enough practice, Legion can be a stall-beast.
---
sorry sir but I‚Äôm gonna have to trash talk you into posting a salt/rant post on Reddit
---
Dying light bro
---
Manage gens so that it doesn‚Äôt happen. You have to be especially carefully against Trapper and Hag, since these killers will often set up and guard a small area with this strategy in mind. The easiest way to prevent a 3 gen lockdown even when solo is to do the gen closest to the center of the map first, so you spread out the gens.
---
Even still, if the killer is 3 gen patrolling and your teammates have locked you into that situation, the best thing you can do is either locate the hatch and the gate farthest away from the hatch. If the hatch is near the 3 gens, wait and hide near the gate farthest away from it for the killer to catch the last survivor needed to open it. They‚Äôll close the hatch, and you can immediately open the gate.
---
However, if theres 3 or 4 of you left and you‚Äôve been three locked, you need to trick the killer by having them fall into their own strategy. Have one teammate loop them close to one of the gens and distract them while they rest of you work on the gen farthest away. The killer may lose interest if they can‚Äôt catch the other survivor or they try to lead them farther away, and go to check on all the gens, so you‚Äôll have to scatter and hide. He won‚Äôt chase very far from that gen for a while, since they‚Äôll want to guard it. So at that point you need to switch positions and loop at that gen while working on the other farthest away.
---
A lot of the time killers will target newer players because they can tell that they're easier to kill. I personally go easy on new players.
---
But judging from hitting you on the hook, it sounds like this Myers was just a dick.
---
"uh im sorry what exactly is a pallet"
---
dc irl
---
Yeah I'm playing on console. My analogue appears fine in every other game. This issue just started happening after the most recent update. It's infuriating knowing that survivors are getting away because of this lol
---
Laughs in Scratched Mirror Myers.
---
It's a feature.
---
The first comma seems fine, the last is ehh but I didn‚Äôt have a stroke reading it, so you good.
---
This had me dying lmao üòÇ she was big mad at you üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
PTB Kate be like *breaking the Sound Barrier noises.*
---
On topic this is why Ace and Tapp are best Survivors. Built-in Iron Will.
---
I've had a blast hooking people and letting them loose by hunting others and then coming back to them while they're still injured lol rather than how I played it initially which was a Lazer focus on killing all, one by one by ensuring if you're hooked once... You dead.
---
I've had a game yesterday where they all escaped eventually injured, and the last player got his second hit from me right at the exit, I picked him up only to drop them inside the exit and waited as if I'm departing with a lover... They crawled out after wiggling their crawling bodies as if to say goodbye, it was.... Beautiful lol
---
I had so much fun losing because I laughed my ass off, I really wish most the players don't take it as seriously as they apparently do!
---
Anyways, thanks for the input :)
---
The last Myers I faced had to have been a cut from a different cloth.  Specifically a cloth draped over his face because he didn‚Äôt find anyone the whole game..
---
If you‚Äôre playing on controller and you have this problem, just zig zag slightly
---
Rip the Old Pill Bottle :(
---
"Killer's ability to see needs to be nerfed REEEEEEEEE" - Rank 20
---
Idk I think it‚Äôs partially because survivors have the advantage and people know that by now.
---
As others have pointed out, the way to beat 3 gen strats is not to let yourselves fall into that scenario in the first place. Much like being  hooked in the basement, it's a position that's powerful for the killer and not meant to be easily overcome.
---
However, whenever this topic comes up I know there is the inevitable "But what if the killer specifically guards those 3 gens the entire game and never goes anywhere else?"
---
If that's the case then you need to switch tactics. If you think a killer is going to just hunker down and claim 20-30% of the map for a 3 gen strat then the best thing you can do is prepare yourself for a war of attrition.
---
Begin by understanding the dynamics have now changed. The killer no longer needs to go hunting for survivors, since the survivors will now come to them. And if they commit to this strategy from the start then understand the survivors now have the following advantages:
---
* No one should be getting hooked prior to 4 gens being completed. In practice since you won't know at the beginning there might be a hook or two since people will probably wander into that zone during the game. All in all, there should be 9-12 hook states between all 4 survivors by the time the 3 gen strat goes into effect.
---
* A majority of the pallets should be intact. Minimal / No chases? No pallets being thrown down. 
---
* In most cases, the killer will essentially be tethered to that area. Which means you can take a hit, run away and if you get far enough, they either  have to commit to downing/hooking you or cut back and check on the generators since you can repair one in 20-40 seconds with 2-3 people depending on perks/items. If you have self-care, this is a situation where it can shine since you can hang on a gen longer than normal, use the speed boost from a hit to get far enough a way and force the killer to make a choice. Most of the time they'll leave you alone and go back on patrol.
---
* Generators lose roughly 1 second worth of repairs for every 4 seconds of regression. You can use this as a rough gauge on whether you're actually making progress or not. Even if it's just a few pixels at a time, your efforts are worth 4x as much as the killers. 
---
* Last but not least, if you feel like your team is slowly losing ground (i.e. you couldn't get the last generator with 4 people, now someone is dead leaving you with three) The map will momentarily be free to explore and find the hatch. Unless it unfortunately spawns near the last 3 gens, you have complete safety to scout it either where it is or where you know it isn't.  Keep in mind, if all the generators regress to 0% and stay that way for awhile, the killer may start to roam knowing they've got a buffer and can afford to maybe pick off someone.
---
And nurse but shhhhh
---
Our fingers are not supposed to feel discomfort either.
---
In Mortal Kombat, Scorpion's tier placement is based completely on his risk-reward scenarios: I tend to think of Billy like that. With Billy, it's all about calculating the risk-reward scenario. You can make all the predictions you like, but unlike killers like Nurse or Spirit where you have to learn your timings, spacing, situational positioning and correction, you just have to calculate risk and trajectory, and the tradeoff is that there is no buffer: if you hit, you're a top-tier instadown killer. If you whiff, you can suffer harsher penalties than almost any other killer bar Legion
---
I mained Trapper at rank 1 for about a dozen seasons so I'm very familiar with the man and the spots.  But only potatoes eat traps on that map.  They're all so painfully obvious to avoid.  Not a stitch of grass anywhere to hide any.  Also ultra rare addon in general will make most games less painful but that's a big thing to have to rely on especially considering their rarity.
---
sneaking to get a surprise hit
---
Man, that was a good joke, I am just laughing on the floor LOL fam, I should save that one for next time, just can't handle that Freddy lunge
---
I mean he wasn't going for other survivors
---
Agreed, have like a token counter on Small Game that tells you how many are remaining.
---
Golden perk icon pack mod.
---
I don't think this is footage of op trying to solve a puzzle and asking for advice.  That might work though.
---
Sometimes you just gotta say the gamer word tbf
---
Honestly tbagging should be nerfed.. Crouch cooldown timer when?
---
Good Job
---
Hard for him not to be when pretty much everything about him screams "never leave the basement!!"
---
You can tell the age of these people by their use of the same words used by kids on call of duty back in the day
---
Ooopsie
---
I mean, any killer can really work at any rank if your good with them. However, if you want to talk about rank 12, nurse is praobly the worse for you to play consdering hgow hard she is. Otherwise, until red ranks, anything works
---
Happy Birthday, Reece!!!
---
a tier
---
...lmao  Did you really wait almost two weeks after this post was made to comment?  What a madlad!
---
I want it in. Brandon James Ghostface is way creepier.
---
Warms my heart man
---
Thank yee :D
---
newer players are easier to kill, so some killers like to go after them more often, and hitting people on hook is sorta like rubbing it in that they hooked you.
---
This is what bugs me about dbd.  Players feel like they have to nerf themselves.
---
I bet ur lying
---
You are welcome :)
---
Something having low achievement numbers doesn't make it any less easy to get. People have to care about achievements to get a lot of them.

He just corrected me. He free handed it off of a google search. Sorry!! Original artist called Amino.
---
Fucking NICE, I've been waiting days for your render on my main, good job man. This is a must have outfit.
---
Tbh I've seen way better from our community!
---
I'm relatively new (about 50hrs over a year but I'm getting into it more) and pretty much only play surv, but you're my kind of Cannibal. That sounds terrible, but I'd gladly be hooked by you!
---
Not to mention offerings, which literally reduce the lifespan of survivors by up to 33%
---
Her addons need the nerf, not her base kit. Only reliable counter to gen-grab Ive found is to run spine chill.
---
They also 'buffed' it in the same patch.
---
The No Mither buff sounds perfect. Doesn't sound OP and makes the perk much, much better than it was.
---
Spirit is the second strongest killer. The strongest is nurse. Even whitout addons, good nurses are broken. With omega blink, its just dumb :P I'm not even a good nurse and i almost always 4K at top ranks using omega blink and range addon.
---
But they won't nerf her because the community is against it.
---
Exactly, as a killer/survivor main, they need to remove the ebony mori, at the very least.
---
the funniest part is knowing how he plays F13. Had the experience of playing survivor while he was survivor too. Was max level and yet was easily the worst survivor of the bunch. Did absolutely nothing and left in a 2 seater, came back as Jarvis and did absolutely nothing and left in the 4 seater with 1 other person IIRC.
---
He seems fine, a real fun killer to go up against. But I wonder, how common is the Dream Pallet add-on in bloodwebs? Because in solo q the add-on will/is extremely powerful especially and for him to have 10 fake pallets every other game which almost guarantee a free M1 (unless you‚Äôre in a SwF) seems pretty damn strong. Maybe change to a purple or red and change the rarity accordingly? Just don‚Äôt want it to be too common.
---
Playing wiht friends for fun is toxic you know? Just stand still and let me kill you.
---
Yah, but I don‚Äôt use spins chill. I also don‚Äôt come across them very often, but when I do, it‚Äôs not fun at all. And that‚Äôs what I was suggesting, maybe, not a nerf to her base gameplay, but her add-on.
---
Lmao
---
Sorry for this response, but:
---
Yeah, you really get outplayed when you
---
-get hit by NOED
---
-get camped
---
-get tunneled
---
-get teabagged
---
-get farmed
---
and you're another toxic dickhead
---
Make sure to stare at it so it can‚Äôt stalk you
---
And Happy Birthday!
---
At the very least do some work on them cus Billy's at least just looks like hes chainsawing the ground.
---
Yep but some people think anything less than a 4k means they are underpowered. That's why this sub is flooded with salty killer mains.
---
This comment better get a shit ton of likes
---
They are better off removing it and making a new perk
---
I play console, luckily, so even at rank 3, (my rank) I never see them. 
---
Yah I‚Äôm aware of how strong she is without add-ons, but at least she‚Äôs playable, playing against gen grabber build is seriously just, almost automatically a loss.
---
Oof. Not surprising though.
---
No man, you sound pretty butthurt and insecure. I thought the video looked cool and added to the community as a whole by providing us with a useful clip on how to dodge huntresses ‚Äúranged‚Äù attack, you don‚Äôt have to undermine everyone you meet, we get it, your good at the game too. You don‚Äôt have to ruin it for the rest of us with your saltyness.
---
&gt;Not that noed is avoidable.
---
What? Its avoidable af.
---
Yeah I feel that. It sucks that the meta for some killers makes the game just brain dead and boring for both sides. At the end of the day though I don't really mind because I can just not be an asshole. Even if it means I'm not ranking up lol.
---
I don't play console but yea from what i've heard its totally different.
---
Yeah,  I just sometimes sit in the middle of the grass or behind a tree in my  fully  brown Blendette outfit and admire how well I blend in.
---
*sees perk discussion*
---
YOU KNOW NOED OP!!!?!
---
That huntress cracks me up. Idk why lol.
---
Nah, with the buff months ago her crouch speed is fine without CS.
---
I'm pretty sure everybody thinks pallets are stronger, that's probably why they're add ons as well instead of the standard
---
was ghostface capable of 4 kills at rank 1? im thinking to buy him but not sure
---
MegHead
---
Gotta check your ping in the lobby or you'll get games like this.
---
You have to be pretty lucky for the combo of those two to work well but when it does all come together and you‚Äôre miraculously the last one left despite running OoO, then you‚Äôre pretty much undetectable
---
Yeah dunno why you got the hate. The reason I actually like legion more than the other killers is because of how human they are in comparison to most of them. Like they are just delinquent teens with edgy masks not freakizoid doctors or ethereal nurses. I'm happy everyone seems to like the photo.
---
To begin the end game collapse. To end the game rather than letting it be drawn out. Like I said, I only do it when the survivors are both good and toxic. Running up to you and then continuously 360'ing you, looping and teabagging, locker hopping, etc.
---
Why does the fire look like a person
---
When your teammates are so bad that you consistently run a useless perk to counteract that shit
---
Once I kobed off a hook, adrenaline popped and I ran right into a trap I saw the trapper set
---
But the rest of the perk stays in tact. Another comment pointed out that they could combine Dark Sense and WGLF. That would also be acceptable. I dont understand why people get so up in arms about changing anything for killers.
---
They have so many advantages, the only way I ever really lose is against 4 man SWF teams who outrank me.
---
There are too many incentives to just killer main. And BBQ is one. Survivors gets shafted 85% of the time. Ive been tunneled by killers then got "thanks for the gateau" messages.
---
The survivors have to give up an extra perk slot to get BP. On top of inherently earning less than the killer unless they're a god survivor. Whereas a BAD killer: A.) Gets help from Bbq because of its ability and B.) Gets just as many BP because of the bonus. It makes the game easier for them as well as rewarding them for it. 
---
All I'm saying is, it could either be broken up or give the survivors something similar.
---
You cant see it clearly but I made the knife as well.
---
Didn't they change it to 33%
---
But isn't the issue that dropping the pallet "moves" the survivors hitbox? So he was safe, but because he wanted to use a pallet he now became a literally bigger target from the hitbox stretching back into the pallet? Combined with the killers swing getting stretched a bit further into the pallet as well. Hard to see that as balanced when its literally the opposite of a fair balance.
---
I'll be making a post with links to all the tutorials I made for the mask and props.
---
XL Downstairs? 
---
Let me live my fantasy!
---
I think only prayer beads needs a nerf
---
I actually got face camped the other day on PC near red ranks. It was a streamer. I actually watched the reply of his stream and his reason was because i choose claudette....
---
HornWATER on xbox. I'm looking for SWF/KYF matches where we can practice to get better, run meme builds, try to sandbag and see who is last alive, have a match where we don't do gens but the killer has to try to slug all 4 survivors and the survivors have to try to get each other up, really anything.
---
You had better be memeing. Hope is a super underrated perk.
---
Imao.
---
Why?
---
It's cause most the op shit is worse on console (except nurse)
---
Until console gets that 60 fps patch it'll be like this
---
It's so much easier to abuse speed perks, and bt console side because killers have wierd framerates and that's not even factoring how much worse console connections seem to be
---
My game always starts minimized for me, can't get it to stop soon enough
---
BBQ should be default for all killers.
---
OwO
---
I'd actually like a small buff to it. Aura of survivors should be yellow to be able to tell difference between them and gens more easily.
---
Makes sense.
---
This puzzle or whatever this is look really annoying honestly...
---
*sniff sniff* 
---
Is something burning?
---
*gasp!* My survivor pudding!
---
I really want them to put in an addon for GF, so when hes in nightshroud he can scream it. Itll take him out, but holy fuck the jump scares would be great
---
frames te is bad all around but it really affects the killer more imo

---
I agree. Wanna play with your buddies, no prob. Just tell them what to do when going against Nurses, billies, and spirits
---
Yeah but they *need* to hear Pig's/Myers'/Jane's breathing/Ghostface's music/Spirit/Hatch/footsteps to invalidate losing and hearing past the age of 30.
---
Not very often do I get people that run into my mori, sorry my photo doesn‚Äôt appease to you
---
Really actuate
---
I wanna make a dismembered corpse outta you!
---
Yeah I understand the attraction with Wraith. Being able to locate survivors on gens while cloaked with no terror radius is definitely appealing, and I like ringing his bell.
---
I didn't stick with any particular killer at first because I was concentrating on getting Platinum and 100%, which I crazily did in 19 days and 26 days respectively.
---
After that I felt more inclined to spend time with the licensed killers and ultimately, ended up spending most of my killer play time using Piggy and Freddy.
---
Nice try, killer player
---
Ya dam kill rushers. Literally taking perks to help them kill people faster and more reliability. The logic that gen rushing is a "negative/toxic strategy" is insane. Look how foolish it sounds when reversed on the killer.
---
Most add ons should be base kit
---
Let's look at doc, why does he need 5 different add ons just for madness to do anything?
---
This is true for so many other killers
---
Basically every green cool down add on and  other similar ones should be base
---
And the add ons should change the powers in some neat aspects (like how new Freddy works)
---
Using doc as an example, what about an add on that allowed shock to do damage but the trade off was a longer change
---
Or a plague add on that removed her blood spit, but doubled her normal infection rate
---
This is the kind of stuff I want to see
---
Mine are probs too strong, but y'all get the idea
---
The issue I see with this is that it‚Äôs bound to Leatherface and as such should be thematically similar.
---
It's most likely this. It just gets me every time. I do feel that the in-game sound is a lot lower than the menu sound though.
---
I had someone report me for "colluding with survivors" for giving them the hatch
---
I think you meant to say "totally ethical surprise mechanics"
---
It‚Äôs weird everybody says it‚Äôs random because from the couple times I played the pig, my friends got  out of the trap on the first box they go to. Idk if they just got really lucky or all the boxes are the same.
---
Hey man you can still have your Airpods in The Fog.
---
Oh, I always just assumed that the hatch was meant for 1 person only at the end of the match
---
The plagleg
---
Typo. Corrected
---
With the new rank system, it's easier for survivor as long as your team doesn't sand bag. You can single pip without escaping, let alone finishing all five gens if you rescue some people and lose the killer one or two times.
---
For killer, even 4Ks are safety pips if the game goes too fast.
---
It is true that killers outside the big 3 have tough times but it‚Äôs not all impossible to 4K with them. Often times it‚Äôs the killer‚Äôs player that doesn‚Äôt induce enough gen pressure that makes it seem like gens are getting done so quickly. SWFs sometimes put themselves at disadvantages. You know they‚Äôre going to be near the hooked player, running Devour Hope, (Make Your Choice works as well) can easily turn the tide in your favor. Add that with Thrilling Tremors (to slow the game) and Haunted Grounds. As well as Franklins Demise if they‚Äôre using items. This gives opportunity to farm survivors onto hook and make them take risks to take each other, which you know they‚Äôll do. They spend time not doing gens, looking for totems which are also a risk and looking for their items too. As a killer you can change your loadout and pathing in game necessary to lessen the advantages that an SwF would have and turn it against them. 
---
With NOED, you‚Äôre crippling yourself as a killer. You‚Äôre using a perk which only comes in when you technically lose. When you let survivors complete the main objective of finishing 5 gens, you‚Äôre admitting defeat in advance and being given a crutch to make a come back in the game. I think it‚Äôs cheeky, NOED and totems are a huge problem in solo q where you have no idea which survivor has done which totem. You can spend the whole game looking for all 5 if 1 player already did 1 yet couldn‚Äôt communicate that. It totems are to be a second objective then a totem counter is necessary. If NOED stays in its current form then a totem counter is necessary, no ifs and buts about it. 
---
With Adrenaline, it‚Äôs entirely different. The survivor is making a bet that they will survive to endgame, and with a good killer, doesn‚Äôt matter which, if you are good at least 1 surv will be dead if exit gates are powered. You‚Äôre healing one state for being alive, many times it gets in when you take a risk. When you engage the killer for a distraction or are being tunneled AD is a life saver. It‚Äôs a strong perk, yeah but it‚Äôs nowhere near as strong as NOED. You are being rewarded for failing to stop the main obj, you can 1 hit me because I completed my main obj. And if totems are a side obj, then an in game counter is needed. 
---
You‚Äôre clutching for straws. BT gives a fighting chance for the player that got hooked from a tunneling killer, it‚Äôs almost a necessity. Farming tm8s off the hook is a dickhead move. You can bait dead hard if you have a brain. It‚Äôs legit a couple seconds that you wait, then the pallet must come down or you get a free down. DS is a good perk yes but it was literally changed so that it only last 60 seconds. In those 60 seconds you can slug the surv down and continue rotating or pick them up for an escape you can expect and plan for
---
I wish I could do that and still pip, nowadays when I play billy I always have to 4k to get a pip because the chaser emblem is always shitty for him
---
When will we see bbq in the shrine again!?
---
It's called fashion
---
Me too I prefer to stay on hook rather being unhooked in front of the killer, being tunneled sucks so much.
---
You'll have more luck throwing the hatchet directly up and it landing on the survivor.
---
Oh yeah. run the best and second best calm addons with M&amp;A, hex, sloppy butcher (for additional pressure, and a perk of your choice
---
Oof. Meg dose not have the face for cornrows lol
---
See I like this. Or combine it with Dark Sense. The only reason I don't run WGLF is because I freely admit I'm not good at killer dodging, and I need perks to help with that. In fact my build is made to AVOID the killer.
---
Technician, iron will, (perk that makes breathing quieter), and urban evasion.
---
Don‚Äôt get me started on console frame rates ;(
---
Just don't buy it if you don't like it, LOL.
---
Yeah recently I was playing wraith and this nea was looping me and 360ing me and was so much better than her teammates so I downed her and tried to find hatch. She was super non toxic and it made for a great chase early in the match.
---
RESPECT THE 4%. HOW COULD YOU SMH
---
Technically it is random because no one knows which box you have to open.
---
Think of it this way, The box does not have a chance to unlock your trap after opening it. One box has a 100% chance of unlocking your trap and the other boxes have a 0% chance to unlock your trap. It's just a matter of taking a random guess at which box it is that will open it.
---
OH I am just poking shit at my main. I was a LF main for the longest time so I am just going for the low hanging fruit that LF is no skill. Insidious camp and win is the strategy
---
&gt;and Beast of Prey aren‚Äôt the best
---
I can't hear you. LALALALALAA
---
They're mad because they're bad
---
Maybe in the entity :)
---
Don't 3 gen.
---
A lot of their add on‚Äôs make more sense now.
---
Sorry there Shiro, but here people dont die when they are killed, instead a spider deity takes their bodies and returns them to life so they can keep playing this game of cat and mouse until they are so far gone the only enjoyment they get is from bullying each other and taking a piss on the killer.
---
Ok, but the post was about splitting off the BP gain, how does that specifically pertain to LF?
---
I'm honestly asking.
---
I would hardly associate Kleptomania with Leatherface
---
U down people so easily with him too, i get no brutality points with him because i down every1 with my chainsaw and don't get them extra bloodpoints
---
No. Then make kleptomaniac one of the standard BW perks.
---
Thats nice from you
---
Na, I honestly rather enjoy watching the streams of updates and the memes more then I do playing anymore.
---
Then what would replace BBQ as Leatherface‚Äôs 3rd teachable
---
:( you said in all seriousness.
---
No. You leave the rest of BBQ alone. Make the aura thing its own pwrk
---
Hey, it's me! I mained ol bubba for this reason lol. I hate how he gets such a bad rep of being a camper and all-around shitty killer. The advantage is I very rarely get salty survivors because he isn't seen as OP and my respectful play surprises them I guess.
---
They do say they were working on a 60 fps rebuild for console no clue if/when that's coming out
---
That plus servers would fix so many problems
---
I wish sab was more useful. The only way to make it help is 99% them and drop them at a key moment. The problem is that being right there for that key moment is rare, and even when u do get it there's always a convenient hook 5 seconds away. Too risky to sab so many hooks and waste time not getting gens.
---
what rank and what killer do you use? Cuz an ACTUAL RED RANK survivor , not a carried or boosted, one is very hard to play against unless you‚Äôre spirit or nurse. Theirs only TWO killers that are viable in red ranks, the rest of the killers just end in a ‚Äú entity displeased ‚Äú or ‚Äú brutal killer ‚Äú at best.

---
But you wont be able to see the killer yourself because you need more than 32 meter but less than 40, which mean either he will se you or you wont be able to see him , 8 meters are not enough to control it .
---
I hope soon, when a killer swings sometimes dead hard is just impossible to use
---
Wazzzzzzuuuuuuuup
---
standing still and waiting for them to stop spinning like a goof ball is a good counter too.
---
If they really bother you that much just bring a Mori or do a build that‚Äôs annoying AF. And or dodge since a lot of people like you tend to do that
---
Honestly, I figure it would be better the other way around, make the Bloodpoint boost separate and keep BBQ as the aura reader making the boosting more accessible to players who can‚Äôt really afford Leatherface
---
Meg, Michael tiered up, oh no oh fuck, she cant hear the music
---
No killer is too powerful when I have the power of bad internet.
---
She only has the face that just recently sniffed a cows ass.
---
In 2 or 1.5 months the new killer comes out I think and rank resets tomorrow
---
Why ? That perk is useless and Freddy has add-ons for seeing auras after someone failed a skill check.

can you see?

Rank resets tomorrow.
---
The new killer in September.
---
i think thats the wrong freddie
---
thanks
---
Saw people do this at Miami super con. Looks great!
---
right lol
---
PREACH! I wear the brightest/flashier cosmetics as a Claudette main and if you can't even see me then it's a YOU problem, not a ME problem.
---
1st world meme if I've ever seen one.
---
You've beaten me to it. Fair play
---
don‚Äôt get me wrong, i enjoy looking at cosplays, but you‚Äôre right. but that‚Äôs bcuz legion is the easiest one to do. just get a random black leather jacket and throw a mask and you‚Äôre done. A cosplay i‚Äôd love to see is Wraith, HillBilly, or Huntress ( not her basic skin, the one with a bear on her head )
---
Yes convert!
---
Will do this, thanks
---
I know someone who has this as his profile picture. But his Huntress also has wings ...
---
Yuhp, and then killers also have the joys of physically hitting someone, but the game saying nope
---
I run into this a lot if someone has so
---
Because the game registers the so before the hit
---
Most I wish I could summon the devs on here xD
---
Serious question, what makes a non-toxic survivor? Not sure if I'm doing it right I haven't been playing long
---
You grabbing her new outfit? I know I am üòÄ
---
Sabo Jesus it is!
---
Thank you for your opinion. I too really want to see bunny feng
---
Ahem....nice bulge.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm sensitive, just considerate and respectful of other people‚Äôs traditions and cultures. It didn‚Äôt say anywhere that white people cant wear black hair styles, it said its offensive, distasteful, and above all- does not look good.  It‚Äôs not calling for equality and demanding rules, the article is asking for respect. If you used more than 1% of your brain to read the article instead of rambling about your superior complex, you would‚Äôve have seen and maybe understood(?).
---
Penis
---
Except when a killer runs NOED and thinks they're actually good.
---
Fuck, I was gonna comment "Hex: hax" and get all popular and stuff
---
Spirit herself is fine. For every upside that she has, there's a downside to counteract it. So overall shes more balanced than the likes of Billy or Nurse.
---
Phase walk makes her good at mindgames? Can work against her, requires full power. 
---
Speedy phase walk? You know when she's close unless she runs prayer beads and she's a 110 killer outside of phasing
---
But at least get the save dwight ü§¨
---
Yeah, you often find a lot of Insidious LF in Rank 20 absolutely demolishing newer players. When they deal with a more competent team, they don't have the tools in their kit to deal with them as easily. Mainly because LF has terrible movement, kind of why he is a terrible killer for higher ranks. Nurse, Billy, and Huntress are way better due to the nature of how they work. Huntress can throw hatchets, negating the need for movement, Billy can chainsaw sprint, and Nurse can teleport, effectively removing pallets quicker or ensuring they have little effect.
---
wasn‚Äôt this jut posted?
---
&gt;Spirit is the second strongest killer
---
Not really. She's underneath Billy definitely. Billy has very few downsides for what he offers whereas Spirit has at least a 1:1 upside:downside ratio
---
Tbagging, flaslight tapping, always be salty if u lose, insta-healing in front of the killer to get him mad and overall just that make killers mad purposley
---
After years of searching, we have finally found the Messiah to deliver us from RNGesus! üôåüèæ
---
In the twitter page of DBD Mobile there are a list of countries where you can play the game, try changing your location to one of those countries.
---
Try selling them on etsy! (Unless this is a scam)
---
Not quite, so it's only the blue and green dress that show survivor auras for failed skill checks. Otherwise you're in a game where the most effective way to wake up and avoid the dream pallet/snare shit is to fail a skill check. Technician makes that MUCH safer to do. Don't knock it until you try it.
---
I haven't seen any survivors complain about freedy. I'm a survivor main and I think it is fun to go against.
---
Why the hell didn‚Äôt you tbag? &gt;:/
---
It can be given with a brown addon, I think.
---
Is that second lady with a gun Mike's mom from Stranger Things?
---
Oh yeah that is what I meant. Sorry im bad at articulating.
---
Keep the aura reading as BBQ, and keep that as a teachable LF ability. But no double BP
---
Make a Bloodweb perk called Kleptomaniac and it literally just says "earn 50/75/100% bonus Blood Points."
---
Better than before.
---
Happens to me too....
---
Do ya one better, call the new perk Blood Feast
---
Those 60 secs are what I call "booty clenching time" cause you know your was is got if she see you.
---
Updoot for Spookyface
---
Also Happy b day random internet person
---
jesus
---
I've only been playing since the first anniversary and I'm nearing 3200 hrs, which is excluding an alt I have üíÄ
---
feels really good to waste your free time
---
Where did you get this picture? Are the new cosmetics official?
---
Nerf bad internet too op
---
The ugly hair Legion.
---
That sounds more killer-y.
---
I was thinking maybe they could release a survivor with a themed perk called Kleptomaniac.
---
Wazzzzzzzzzuuuuuupppp
---
Oh my god even wraith is there O:
---
Coming from someone who is actually salty. He wasn't rude or even wrong. He was actually pretty nice and OP had no problem with his comments.
---
Technician is a weak RNG based perk and nobody gonna run it just for Freddy. 
---
Again, Freddy could as well just run these add-ons to counter it. But nobody is gonna use it anyway.
---
Yes, unless ghostface is around, then it becomes a buttdance party
---
Thicc terror radius
---
Ah okay thank you very much. My friend told me that TBagging was funny when I'm about to be picked up, but evidently not!
---
Hm....sad to see the Egyptian Cosmetic made by a fan be better than this. That guy who entered his cosmetic did a great job and they should go with his idea. Not this. So much potential for an Egyptian Cosmetic lost. Their design team lacks in creativity.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ccf0bh/cant_wait_for_the_new_update_to_come_out_so_they/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
BBQ is easily countered by survivors. You can hide in a locker for a few moments after hook to mask your aura, or you can fake out the killer by walking one way and then switching directions after the 4 seconds of aura reading expire. Hiding in a locker is especially effective, since that fools the killer into thinking there is a survivor near the hook, and they'll waste some time looking around for them. 
---
The survivors can turn it into something that just increases bloodpoint gain and has relatively little effect on the match, or they can allow it to be one of the stronger detection perks. It's almost a no-brainer for most killers either way because muh bloodpoints, but I don't think it's overpowered at all. It's not like NOED or Adrenaline or something which can just invalidate a well played game for no good reason.
---
I don't think the entitlement will ever end because if they complain and whine loud enough the developers will listen.
---
lmao that's an enormous stretch
---
I still haven't seen any proof, just jokes, so I'm guessing this whole thing is a typical massive reddit overreaction.
---
If it's so easy to make a game un-fun for others when not using things such as exploits/glitches, then there's something fundamentally wrong with the game itself and something needs to be changed. Like more countermeasures guy. My message at it's core is not "this is still fun wtf is your problem," I don't LIKE being camped or tunneled, I'm just not gonna get pissed at someone for playing a certain way. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
Finished after Full Moon
---
Chill dude, it's just a game.
---
I used ooo and sole survivor to see ghost face for almost the entire match when I had teammates dc and kill themselves early on.
---
Without it, he would have stalked me to death literally.
---
So by that logic Freddy should also be affected by his Blood Pools if he walks over them?
---
The pallets are a choice not every Freddy game will be with pallets, they are obviously strong, but spinning the table on who is actually more affected by them is just, well I want to say whiny... but... yeah, whiny will do!
---
Well, if the killer is close too you and you can't escape a hit 'cause there are no pallets or windows, tbagging like twice can be looked at like a: oh u got me so im greeting u for your well play. But tbagging behind pallets and stuff like that is just toxic
---
Well, tell the survivors to stop using troll tactics and garbage perks. Last match I played had three Claudette clones clumped in a mobile shell game while the other two got themselves on top of a rock with no way for me to get to them and just stayed there the entire match. 
---
Honestly, I'm fine taking an L when it's fair, like yesterday I had one where it was 3/5, but the last two pulled some kind of ping pong tactic with the gates that got me running between them and they juked me. However, the majority of matches are stacked in the survivors' favor, especially if it's someone new to the game.
---
PS4 Europe, DegeneratePleb. Rank 3 survivor right now, no mic.
---
Oh yeah that shit is stupid, I wouldn't bother doing that. Sometimes killers message me and promise not to kill me if I let them run me around for points. Is that good etiquette or should I say no?
---
Dude that auto lock or whatever the hell
---
Bs where I‚Äôm literally right next to them and it doesn‚Äôt connect pisses me off so much
---
Yea I played with you few times, not many red rank survivors :)
---
I'll add you.
---
What does bhvr stand for?
---
Then we are gonna get the reputation of being garbage instead as againt a decent surv team non cheese canibal is suicide
---
Woah, really? What‚Äôs your gamertag?
---
Thx man!
---
You better believe I run or swing through 90% of pallets
---
OK
---
She‚Äôs second best mate, mind games aren‚Äôt the full of it, if you try to walk, she‚Äôll hear you if you‚Äôre injured, if you try to run, she‚Äôll trace your track marks, prayer beads are ridiculous.
---
It's in a first post...
---
I play on a PS4 and this is the game that made me turn of PSN messages from strangers.
---
u/Lord-Lukefj don't give them the satisfaction of getting annoyed at them, that's what those toxic saltmongers want. Just go to the next game you did good and they got the rough end of the deal.
---
Depends, if u want farm points its ok to farm here and there, but if ur at higher ranks where it takes about 15 min to find a game, I would just reject it and play a normal game, but yea, farming isn't something I would consider "bad"
---
Heated gamer moment
---
Yea I tend to just ignore it, if u don‚Äôt say anything in endgame chat and the survivors puke out a bunch of tripe their the ones who look immature and dumb. Like last night I played against premade SWF, obv on comms, they actually got all gens repaired but I hooked one of them end game. And OF COURSE they could not accept the fact that one of them was not escaping. I knew this and slugged the other 3, 2 with DS, they didn‚Äôt get far and I turned a 1K into a 4K because they couldn‚Äôt accept the fact that one of them was not escaping. End game chat was a waterfall of salt and a bunch of stuff I wouldn‚Äôt even repeat, bet they felt pretty silly when I just left without giving them what they wanted... a reaction.
---
Usually in endgame chat I start with "GG" If the complaining starts then I say "Sorry that you feel way" and just leave. If the want to be adults and talk or have a laugh about something that happened I'll gladly stay but as you said its rare that they are civilized adults.
---
Can you get a better pic of the knife?
---
Wtf is a crutch perk. Every perk is a crutch for playing.
---
oops, thought you were someone else
---
It barely changed visually, from what I can tell? And the original pretty skybox is not back, sadface.
---
Fair enough. I have been playing for just over a month and I'm rank 15, not sure if that's low enough to warrant farming?
---
If it makes you feel any better BHVR said that won't happen anymore when dedicated servers are live.
---
It may be garbage, but it's my garbage.

If you don't like unfair situations, here's my complete killer guide to never getting them:
---
Step one: play ONLY NURSE. You'll lose a lot but when you get really good, you're unstoppable.
---
Thank you, that was my TED talk.
---
Just her add-ons but mainly PB. Her base kit is fine
---
Julie is gonna have a feral frenzy if she's finds this photo...
---
Slightly, still majorly depressed lol.
---
Sure thing I'm working on a series of tutorial posts that I'll end up linking on the sub reddit be on the lookout for that.
---
Agreed.
---
I just got to the point where I'm just like fuck it and run noed with Franklins when I get a 4 man at rank 6
---
I like this idea, except that it would encourage killers to bring an ebony mori every game so they can show off their new animations. Survivor would be a miserable experience until the hype dies down.
---
Or is this a feature for survivors that die before everyone else escapes/dies?
---
Why do people like susie so much?
---
I got her skin because I liked the color blue.
---
*mumbles in Huntress is all well and good until a survivor does a tight walled loop and most half walls are impossible to throw over*
---
What does this have to do with the post?
---
The killers loadout will not be shown to survivors until the game is over. This is so SWF groups don't inform their friends of all of the killers perks once they die. It's been like this for a while now. Are you a returning player or just don't normally play survivor.
---
OR are you saying that even after the game is over over it still isn't loading.
---
Wait is their a new skin for gf? Or are these just made by op
---
It is, red and purple ranks is somewhere where it happens rarely, but in those ranks it takes a long time to queue so i woulds just play normally w/o farming
---
Yup one of them spun around on the ground and I just said you spun with me we are brother after letting him get the hatch
---
So am i to understand that any late game perks are admissions of defeat? Such as remember me, bloodwarden? The game doesn't end when all gens are done, the game ends when survivors escape. I would reccomend you try some late game builds ,those are really tense and fun games.
---
You cannot put enough pressure with any m1 killer (excluding the big 3 ofc) on big maps,that is absolutely ridiculous ive seen tru3 ardetha and many other killers mains who get solid down hooks and so on but the gens still get done in seconds and aint their fault cause they are experienced players and put lots of pressure but it's simply not enough. Smart survivors dont usually 3 gen themselves and if they are a swf on top of that they will know when to stay on gens ,when to go for saves ,when to hide and so on, funniest thing is when you injure everyone and get a down BUT wait it doesn't matter cause the fuckers are a organised swf and as soon as you get him down the last gen pops everyone's back at full health ready and daring.
---
Aint a survivors objective also to survive? So you are constantly failing your objective to survive by getting downed and so on, perks like DS and BT reward you and your teammates for being shit and not taking hits eachother, not picking the right time to save and so on. They ain't called second chance perks for no reason.
---
Camping is punished by losing score. The killer is meant to kill multiple survivors. If camping was intended then survivors would not be able to rescue eachother and would die on first hook. And wtf is a gen rush, thats doing the only thing we can as an obj. You wouldent be able to kick gens or have perks like bbq if camping was intended.
---
Thank you but I mean I can do well with them if I don‚Äôt let them a chance but with people that goes and trolls knowing I‚Äôm a low killer is the things that bother me

Borrowed time should not be a perk, it should be a mechanic of the game. Whenever a survivor is unhooked they get borrowed time for 60 seconds. That will stop campers and tunnelers. 60 seconds is too much time to waste, they wont tunnel anymore.
---
I think it should come down too this; if u need bloodpoints for something; go ahead and farm, but if u dont need them at that moment then just play the game normally
---
What is coming with the new update that should "remove" these exploits?
---
When you freeze in place but to you you‚Äôre still running around there‚Äôs a good chance of lag switch. That‚Äôs what they do, they freeze you in place while killer just runs around killing.
---
Wat
---
*sigh* once again. Taking the blood Points away from the perk literally won't change the perk, just the bloodpoints. Why do survivors have to run 2 perks to get a watered down version of 1 killer perk? The killer doesn't have to do anything special for his BP or aura reading. Whereas the survivor has to jump through hoops.
---
The perk is a cash grab attempt to make people buy LF. I've read more than a few posts saying BBQ showed up in the shrine TWICE in all of '17 and never at all last year. Then another post saying it won't show up for another year in the past week.
---
Leave the aura reading the same and a LF teachable. But removing the BP doubling will have no impact on the gameplay.
---
I see alot of wanting cake and eating it too on killers already inherently stronger than survivors.
---
"Its easy to get gen rushed and get no kills"
---
Against 4 man SWF, meaning you got outplayed. And again, removimg the BP double DOESN'T AFFECT THE GAMEPLAY. You'd still have lost against those survivors with or without the extra BP.
---
I'm just hoping that the new update will remove these exploits.
---
Can you elaborate? Here's a few reasons why i think Spirit is higher tier:
---
* At the highest levels, Billy remains very loopable. If survivors makes very little mistakes, they should beat billy. You can mind game the spirit but she will catch you at some point if she's good.
---
* Billy is quite weak in some specific maps such as Lery.
---
It's pretty safe to say that literally everyone thinks this unless they just bough the game yesterday.
---
Yes of course;)
---
There's nothing wrong with doing what you're doing people just get salty so just keep playing like the way you want
---
thank you for saying it, this is why I can't be on reddit for too long.
---
&gt;I'm just hoping that the new update will remove these exploits.
---
How would it? I might've missed something in the patch notes that you are talking about.
---
Wow is this Nintendo switch?
---
My PUB build is Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, and Small Game.
---
Give it a try. Even if you just run small game in place of something else in your build, it helps out a LOT. The problem isn't that you couldn't find the totems, it's that you haven't played long enough to know where all of the totems couple potentially spawn. After awhile, you'll just start knowing where to look, and it becomes a matter of luring the killer away once you know where it is, or when to strike on a totem.
---
No need to worry. It's a Meg. She hears him; she's just saving her sprint burst.
---
Yep!
---
150k blood points is what you get if you already have the perk and you buy it
---
I'm hoping that the update will fix this, I never said it was in the patch notes.
---
Not mad at all, and I guess you speak for OP since your able to just know what everyone means all the time, OP knew there would be people trying to shit on his video because, this is reddit where people take out their frustration on others genuine excitement, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs nice at all. undermining someone‚Äôs clip that they were excited to share by calling the killer ‚Äúbaby‚Äù is a pretty scummy thing to do. I accept your opinion on the matter, I just don‚Äôt agree with that the guy said. In other words, cool opinion bro!
---
Flair checks out
---
The first 2 are actually very common thoughts, but  that's the first time i saw that for hillbilly.
---
Agreed, incredibly underrated against campers. I suck at Decisive strike (100 percent failure, but i am a level 8 survivor üòÇ), this perk seriously fks with campers and can even make it harder to patrol certain areas (hooks near gennies, for example, getting disabled).
---
Gang bang me at once.
---
Combine WGLF and We‚Äôll make it
---
Lmao the generator destroyer one made me laugh
---
Why would they body block lol? 60 of borrowed time, no need to body block lmfao. Its just a waste of time for the killer. You can pop a gen in 60 seconds, so why would they still tunnel?
---
Restored later. Still, losing the right hook can be incredibly shitty for killers, especially since breakdown does it without you using any resources (outside of a being hooked üôÉ)
---
I play Billy, and I don‚Äôt have a problem with Lerys (or the game). Sure, you can‚Äôt  do chainsaw snipes, but using windows puts the survivors at a disadvantage, since you can still nab them through the window very easily. And those maps are small enough that his mobility doesn‚Äôt matter (but it‚Äôs still very possible to patrol well on them using the chainsaw)
---
It's players like this is the reason I started playing huntress
---
last time i played doctor and got the game map everyone d/c‚Äôd
---
That last part is kinda my whole point. If these people wanna play like that, just let em, they'll derank and you probably won't see em much longer. Well, if they ever fix the matchmaking lol, I still see the occasional rank 17 or so in my rank 7+ games lol.
---
Myers??? Wait tops him on what?
---
I like the dying light perk. Anything to slow the gen rush down will help
---
‚ÄúAs a survivor main‚Äù
---
**I decide to state my role in this game cause doing so makes my opinion more valid than yours**
---
PS4 US: micropunx. I'm level 17 I think. I've only been playing a couple weeks so I'm looking for some chill swf and people to get better at the game with
---
Like Lakitu from Mario üòÇ
---
Dodge this
---
I once did the same thing as a baby dwight against a camping shape. He stood under the hill hook and even looked straight at me
---
Luckily I was able to hit them twice to down them.  Later they finally crawled down so I was able to hook them.  Too bad I didn't get to Mori them.
---
So you really think that DS and borrowed ARENT some of the most powerful survivor perks? Come on now.
---
Y.. You do realise I am the OP, right? It's kind of MY discussion?
---
FYI: the point is that BBQ is a strong perk. The BP is unnecessary since the killer inherently earns more BP. Then you run BBQ and get a strong perk with double BP, just for doing what killers do. Whereas survivors have to run 2 perks for a watered down version on top of playing a very specific way to capitalize on it.
---
That‚Äôs quite interesting that you would even remember me playing. I haven‚Äôt been on that game in probably 6+ months now. I don‚Äôt even know who you are. But please keep lying.
---
So then wtf is the problem, killers literally waste peoples time and ruin your games with their countless options of how to make the game an insta-lose or just to be a dick in general but here we're talking about how that all doesn't matter but the "fuck you" afterwards is the real problem? I don't get how people get more upset about swearing than the actual  act of being a douchebag, I get why companies give a shit with the FCC existing and all but why do you as a person care so much?
---
Remember that guy that would DC when you down him then comments on your profile telling you to kill yourself yep that's this dude
---
Negative reputation?  Excuse me?
---
It's super fucking annoying
---
&gt;I am interested, would purchase. Are you making all killers?
---
   
---
I will be glad to blind everyone. if order =)
---
Mmmm ok so from a killer mains prospective it works great when multiple people are off the gens trying to help. If not then it's not worth it.
---
I my experience Killer lobbies get me in pretty much instantly and I am usually waiting around several minutes on survivor side.
---
They are if you are dumb enough to let them trigger. You, as the killer, are the one in control of their trigger condition. No tunnel -&gt; never see DS in your life. If someone tries to force it by running into your face directly, you should be suspicious.   
---
Borrowed Time -&gt; only triggers when the unhooking happens within terror radius, even if you go back to the hook, if they are out of your terror radius -&gt; no borrowed time.
---
Tis naught but naysayers speaking of whimsical tales of camp.
---
Barring hairstyle and beard, which're reasonably common? No.
---
This place isnt a bad spot. You can go on the rock across from it and lunge over to it, the survivor is probably doing a disservice to themselves by being in that spot
---
I like this as well. Because WGLF forces you to just unhook all game for the perk to even be worth running, where you could've ran adrenaline/DH/DS/BL, or any other perk more useful.
---
Have a screenshot of a feng on a rock in one of the Macmillan maps, I was trapper and there was nothing I could do. 
---
It was on that day I started playing 360 noscope bunny
---
Imagine the worst version of DBD possible. Stiff and blocky character models, zero music when in a trial, minimal graphics (basically just some Minecraft looking trees/gens/exit gates with no walls, floor or sky) and the ‚Äúvoice acting‚Äù sounds like it was ripped straight from DBD by recording it onto a cassette tape, then the cassette tape got run over by a car lol.
---
This was the funniest meme i seen in a long time
---
&gt;I'd seriously want a Michael Myers/the Shape one.  Do you have a website or something? I'm interested! This looks super authentic, original and well made.
---
you can pribrobovat. you can write me on twitter or instagram
---
Ok so when I have someone hooked by the gate I just need to run 32m away and hope I get to the gate in time. Got it.
---
So when exacly does bill come out? Along with freddy rework.
---
Ya it‚Äôs me who is pathetic, you‚Äôre right.
---
Just like the ending to Hereditary.
---
this is supposed to be part of the native-tribe set.  From what I know there‚Äôs other killer skins involved and they included plague because she would most likely be the insane human sacrifice tribalist.
---
But is enough to make jukes and running to opposite directions, and thats only with Normal Terror Radius Characters, agaisnt Spirit or Hag and things like that you have a larger window of Safe Aura-Reading, anda agaisnt Pig and Wraith you just laugh on their faces as they try to Crouch/Go Invisible
---
I meant I believe the only reason the killer should be around the hook is if the survivors are giving them a reason to. Map pressure is better than camping. Ones on a hook, another is being chased, one person is probably going for the save, which means maybe one person is doing objective.
---
That is so cool! Very good job on them.
---
Thats very true (+ ghostface).
---
How nice of you to admit that my earlier comment was right.
---
ThE kilLeR hIt mE, HiTboxEs trAsh
---
When you have NOED and instantly slap her back down
---
But at least it wasnt old sabo where it forced the killer to slug/basement hook
---
Is this /s?
---
LMFAO I thought the same thing!  It's like the two freddy's had a glorious baby.
---
This is pretty satisfying to watch
---
Since it was in the shrine this year already, probably like another year or two.
---
Killer or survivor? PC or console? What is your region? All of those play into your answer. Because as a rank 10 killer i wait 2 minutes tops for a match. As a survivor I wait 3 tops
---
Susie is my favorite legion but it‚Äôs true.
---
Good job, Kronk!
---
That sound at the end spooked me.
---
Unnoticeable...so it was good?
---
Maybe with the picture add on forgot what it‚Äôs called
---
He‚Äôs struggling with the reality that we do not have Bunny Feng.
---
Most definitely would be them but I think I would play Bill because I love L4D and Ace because I like his design for killers it'd be Ghostface because well it's Ghostface
---
In the video you can see that she hit the hooked survivor instead of me, it was cause of the angle we were at that she missed.
---
Thank you for the non toxic and thought out response. The actual best solution I've seen is combine WGLF and we'll make it. It basically just adds extra BP to we'll make it.
---
And I agree about the gameplay. I can instantly tell if it's SWF by how hard it is to find anyone. Or the teamwork i see. And it gets incredibly frustrating getting macked on and losing a pip because I just couldnt do anything. It also doesnt help I choose not to run perks like ruin and noed very often.
---
But if it isnt SWF I get all 4 kills or at least 3 a good portion of the time. (I'm rank 9 killer btw)
---
In short: I get killers need stuff like BBQ, NOED, ruin and such to counter the communication of SWF. But if you're solo surviving it sucks ass to play, then get face camped or tunneled and leave the game with 5k BP. While he gets 40k+ for toxic behavior. I should've realised I just wanted a BP bonus for survivors that was more viable.
---
The Hag = The Old Lady
---
oMg, kIlLeR nEeDs nErF
---
Ahh so you wouldn‚Äôt care about their perks just their character in general, cool!
---
We took the photos on a abandoned ski lift, so it was probably forbidden to enter anyway:D
---
And thank you:)
---
Never gonna happen
---
Nea has the most diverse and useful perks. IMO.
---
As a MegHead, I give it to other fellow megHeads :)
---
I just said that to say that I'm on the receiving end guy lol. I also never said my opinion is more valid. Argue with what I actually said, and not what you think I meant by it.
---
I'd say is more due to the game's bad hit registration. If you want, look up True's videos, there's one where the game clearly turns his chainsaw (Hillbilly) to the hook instead of letting it hit the survivor.
---
She does. Wouldn‚Äôt have any p3 Clauds speed crouching around the map anymore if the game was like this.
---
Julie too pls
---
That is satisfying?
---
Then why even bother bringing in Hex perks if you can't handle them being destroyed? That's the entire point of the Hexes it's a high risk-high reward system, if you can't handle your totems being destroyed then that's a personal issue and I recommend using alternatives.
---
Yes, give reasons to farm survivors off hook soon as they get hooked
---
I agree, though, I do have a lot of fun with insta heals and one shot hatchets lol
---
I do believe I said I don't want the aura reading nerfed. Right? First paragraph? I fail to see how removing the BP makes the perk "weaker"
---
I can get 4 kill games without running NOED, bbq, ruin, or nurse's. The killer is inherently stronger at base. Even more so on certain killers like GF and MM who have INSTA DOWNS. They also earn more BP easier.
---
So yes. My point changed to the fact that theres no incentive to play survivor because killer is easier, in gameplay AND BP earning. You happy?
---
My view changed through discussion, which IS the point of dsicussion, no?
---
Way too far. Maybe like 12/10/8.
---
Yeah, I just played a game and this Claudette was quite literally, right next to me, and I missed. ?????
---
Reverse the numbers, right? It would give MORE distance as it levels up right?
---
I mean you're not wrong
---
But eustace! You ARE bald!
---
It was at first but I‚Äôve got used to it üòÇ
---
Hey, I'll send you a request!
---
Pretty nice. Did you make the masks yourselves?
---
Ok heathen
---
I‚Äôve never been as confused and astonished as I am at this current moment.
---
I just got bitched at today because I had a "good" build as Survivor, he called me Toxic and Trash and said people like me ruin this game because I was using Self Heal, it's impossible to have fun in this game because no matter what you do people will blow up messages with hate
---
Same but then I go back to an old video of his or another dbd youtuber and I feel the dting ths second I go back
---
Also that new minecraft video he did was fuckin wild
---
Same and inoo aha I watched it soon as it was posted
---
You don‚Äôt understand lmao he‚Äôs not wrong.
---
Ur forgiven if u need them bloodpoints
---
As long as you don't start killing people before any gens are done you're probably fine. if you start rushing kills you risk not pipping
---
You accuse me of salt but man, I can smell the ocean. I JUST said, maybe instead do something with survivors. Like combine WGLF and WMI as others have stated.
---
But you keep focusing on the fact I ORIGINALLY said split bbq. When I just admitted my opinion had changed. Go ahead and read my other comments throughout this post before you respond. I have changed my mind. Leave BBQ alone. And do as stated above is now my opinion. Make it worthwhile to play survivor alone.
---
Idk why ppl downvoted u, as a main killer, I even let ppl like u escape.I hate to see dumb asses screwing good players game.
---
I'm just looking for DBD friendos. My steam name is "Whomst" and my profile picture is Mr Meeseeks.
---
i feel like the cooldown to teleport is a bit too long
---
Whats pipping?
---
Yea I agree not sure what it should be changed too though
---
You‚Äôre 100% right, I just think it‚Äôs funny how survivors will preach/bitch at killers who are doing things a killer would reasonably do.
---
I was about to commend you for playing Kabal and Huntress until I heard you play Legion. You were this close to greatness!
---
I like giving the hatch to either A.Someone that I feel bad for bullying if i felt like I did so, or B. Someone that genuinely did really well but still would have lost because of their team
---
I actually kinda like it
---

---
Kate and Jane looking good
---
I‚Äôve got a better idea, here‚Äôs a cosmetic for 1080 Auric cells. And there‚Äôs a season pass coming too. What a bargain!
---
Not sure how he has Insta down when he's always running after white chicks stabbing them multiple times and falling down 24/7 lol
---
Or you turn on your monitor and look with your eyes
---
Spirit only harmed a window
---
I think having it on a cooldown 30/45/60 which will 100% suppress the next notification of a failed repair check would be nicer so survivors have more control.
---
Death is not an escape, but escape is a death.
---
No problem! Glad you‚Äôre liking the game too! The doctors pretty great for locating survivors. I love using the Distressing perk with him, which increases your terror radius 20+ meters, causing survivors to go mad quicker (letting you find them) and gives a nice bloodpoint bonus. Fun stuff :)
---
Especially when there was no ruin
---
nice!!
---
I would say "that one from the legion that have a feminine voice" but susie voice is deeper than joe
---
It is alluded that the entity granted her the power to take revenge on her father, but we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs dangling that on a string or if she already has, and servitude to the entity is payment. Damn you, ambiguous lore!
---
It has a demonstrable niche use against Freddy. Plus killers don't really expect it which gives it a little bit more use. Embrace it.
---
Killer was lagging the whole game so that explains me being stuck on the window and whatever the hell that noise was but no idea how I appeared on top of the roof.
---
I dunno have it be a side ability. Let him use all his bombs
---
1st bomb could just be M1
---
Sheer Heart Attack could be his power. Maybe he could deploy it and it could hunt survivors on its own or he could control it idk. 
---
Bites the Dust could be an ability he can only use when the gates are powered. Maybe make it an obsession mechanic of some sort. Have it be able to rewind the game to 1 Gen with survivors being healed and Kira getting a second chance.
---
Mori could be what he did to Koichi, but with the successful finish
---
I won‚Äôt embrace it, since there are many much better perks to use. Plus, if you‚Äôre missing skillchecks against anyone else.... the killer deserves to get you. Additionally, just missing a skillcheck to wake up against freddy isn‚Äôt even deadly. Just leave that area. Automatically works better than technician, and you still get a perk slot.
---
Nobody is gonna run that perk for Freddy, trust me.
---
At best, people will keep running Adrenaline to counter his Dream World by rushing gens.
---
The community is toxic on both ends, get b*tched at for Killing as Killer and get b*tched at for Surviving as Survivor. That's just my games anyway.
---
800x600 dbd looking good

How were they able to even get a copyright on that??

---
That's what a lag does too though. I deal with my connections bogging out sometimes.
---
Downvote for preposterous use of c.
---
That's wicked. Do you run record for all your game time or got lucky with the capture?
---
1 min as rank 1 ps4 killer, survivor is way worse
---
Hmm, sounds pretty bad, but there are teammates far worse who literally just hook farm and urban evasion along the edges of the map until they get the hatch.
---
You want proof that a console can be hacked?......do you live under a rock?
---
I had a game the other day as Pig on Gideon's. Two survivors instantly dc'd and I knew what had to be done.
---
I farmed with the David and Nea, taking them to gens and letting them wiggle out when we got there. When all of them were powered, I carried one to an exit and dropped them, opened the door, and carried them to the entity's wall. They didn't leave right away, they teabagged as a "thank you" and I (slowly) teabagged in response.
---
I felt happy
---
Michael is daddy don't do this to him
---
Can you play mobile
---
IKR!
---
I tend to not cleanse anything unless I‚Äôve hit my first skillcheck. It kinda depends on the game.

---
Why she got a prosthetic leg tho? ü§î
---
Dead by daylight in a fucking nutshell, lag, ear rape and glitches, i see nothing weird here, everything is fine, perfectly fine, nothing wrong at all, it's all perfect
---
Then there's the SWF that's suicidal for the meme. Friend rushes over to save me? I stop struggling and yell "GET BAITED".
---
Just so you know, Freddy is getting removed from the game and will be replaced by a different killer with the same name and model, but different abilities.
---
EA BAD
---
Good luck taking the survivors out
---
I dunno, that leg looks dope tho.
---
STOP
---
Meh, it just makes for short and boring games on both ends in my opinion. Less bloodpoints too.
---
True (although I never played back when it was permasab). I think either faster sab times or longer disable times would help balance this out. I'm sure there are other possibilities as well.
---
So playing with friends is considered cheating now? Huh that's new.
---
Green mori's just for people who equip this
---
Joey is the best Legion but I seem to be the only one who thinks so.
---
This game is in a *perfect* state
---
Follow the scratches...
---
I'm only 12 after 400.
---
Yeah they're official
---
Am I supposed to be offended?
---
1: You should learn how to code so you can write your own (along with scripting) and get familiar with reverse engineering and proxy devices. 
---
2: What you choose to do with that information is on you.
---
The LOL
---
i do but i end up losing the scratches because they are really hard to follow in the corn
---
Yea he‚Äôs like a bloodhound. I just wish his hallucinations were more believable to the survivors. Like if they swung at you or chased you for a sec it‚Äôd be way more effective at confusing/scaring the shit out of them.
---
No that‚Äôs not what lag does. There‚Äôs a distinct difference between normal lag and lag switching. I have horrible internet with 500 kB a second I know lag. Look up monto or puppers lag switch videos for an example of the difference with lag switching. It‚Äôs a very obvious difference from normal lag. 
---
Normal lag is rubberbanding. Lag switching is when everyone freezes in place and just start dying magically.
---
How does it work now?
---
Now of course I only scratched the surface with my previous comment but for very obvious reasons I won't go into detail. But that's basically how it can be done.
---
The video here was a rubberband no?
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
*Cries in Legion*
---
Yeah I love character customization too! And tbh it would be a nice sight to see rather than having 4 of the same character. Although it could be possible to be put in the game as new survivors come with perks that players want.
---
Dint worry thatll be me
---
[Mori WITH the hatch](http://imgur.com/a/XemqqQq.gif)
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm glad, this thread was a success. My last one wasn‚Äôt very well received. To say the least.
---
I tried that and it did seem to work, but the problem still persists and also the slight zig zag is another slow down. It's terrible. I can't believe this is even an issue in the game. Since the last update, there has been more than one game breaking bugs i.e., killers being able to see survivor silhouettes near aura items. This is just another smh.
---
As Survivor: probably Nea. Urban Evasion is incredibly useful in my experience.
---
Killer: Billy. I find Enduring is just too valuable to go without.
---
They should just change it so it‚Äôs 100% for the whole trial.
---
I only recently got back into this game since the initial launch, and am amazed we've gotten this far. The developers have a whole horde of shit to wade through.
---
Yah, I agree for the most part. Maybe, remove in-phase collision.
---
Vs Billy? Who can do the same thing except instadown you and moves faster and his power has no cooldown?
---
Yeah I can see nea being used a lot. And yeah Billy‚Äôs power is one of the more better ones.
---
I was totally hoping to see you hit him again XD
---
Probably tinker perk
---
Thats pretty fucking unlucky
---
I would play spirit but ghostface is too hip to not be cool to play üòé
---
Yes! That's the only thing I wish were different. Right now nobody cares about them
---
Remind me who Adiris is again.
---
Ducking a hatchet and watching it go over your head is one of the most fun things to do in this game
---
Susie
---
Spirit does have some quite solid perks plus power
---
Daddy myers will never die
---
Hopefully he's still fun. I didn't know that when I bought him.
---
take my updoot
---
Freddy.
---
It even says in his lore that The Entity had to temper the hell out of some of his skills to make it fair for the survivors.
---
I use to enjoy using a range of killers but I feel at red ranks a lot more survivors can bully the weaker killers and it happens often so I try to stick to the top 5 unless I‚Äôm going for an achievment.
---
She obviously just got back from the music festival in Costa Rica on her self-discovering life journey.
---
Good luck

/s
---
I think you dropped something bud
---
I‚Äôd rather the devs buff WGLF than nerf BBQ. Everyone needs more bloodpoints to deal with the grind.
---
That's what the dbd forums are for
---
I become a massive pussy as soon as I see that dying light is on me
---
Who do you think the entity is? Pac-Man was chased by ghosts for long enough
---
He had the mask on backwards
---
But how else will I be able to let my salt out after carrying a team only to be left behind on my first hook?
---
I really don't know why they removed the little screaming heads from Freddy's hand when he puts down dream snares and dream pallets. I think they make a lot of sense, at least for the snares.

it has to be satire
---
like yoinks scoob
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt play at rank 18-20.
---
Killers like Myers just want what they can‚Äôt have
---
i also never notice warning sounds
---
Because you made a statement about what lag does and I just wanted to clarify and differentiate because what you said sounded like you weren‚Äôt sure the difference. Besides this is public so you‚Äôre not the only one who can benefit from information. Sorry if it came off douchey, Not my intention.
---
^this
---
Should I pair it with No Mither?
---
He escapes when he was already hooked. That should have clearly been a sacrifice for the killer.
---
I realized too late that I forgot to give the original source with this. While I wish I could be as fabolous as him, [it is actually this man.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9teqjx/want_as_freddy_mercury_kruger_for_halloween_my/)
---
I mean, a decent killer should know "wait a second, I've already killed one guy and only 1 gen has been done. I need to slow down on the killing and focus on other areas if I want to double pip". It's happened to me before where the first guy I hooked killed himself and the second one Dc'd. I decided to slow down on the hooking and focus more on just bashing the gens, stabbing them and waiting for them to heal
---
*Oooohhhh, he‚Äôs trying!*
---
I think you overestimate the complexity of that dude's comment. It was a direct reply- not too confusing.
---
Technically there's only two. Joey and Susie are literally just names and cosmetics. They don't really have much story or even their own voices. The legion is just that killer that costs $38 if you want all four of them. Mind you none of them are better than D tier
---
#BUT THATS JUST A THEORY
---
*A GAME THEORY*
---
I'm a proud person and being given the hatch offends me. Let me die an honorable death. Pity is for the weak.
---
And here we see a salty p3 claudette who somehow survived with barely half a brain after egc killed her while she was too busy t-bagging a baby killer in the exit gates
---
It seems like the Freddy vs Jason scene where he was going to kill that one teen and his shadow grows across the street.
---
If you want a cool Freddy Glove I can link you a site where a guy will Weld one together for you and it will take about 6-7 months or so. 
---
The cheapest goes for $65 U.S. dollars I believe.
---
Thats why I told him an advice
---
Survivor Wise: Meg, Nea, and David.
---
Killer: myers, clown, hag, spirit, billy and nurse
---
For me.
---
If both of them were base kit, yea, that would be stupid. Especially in the end game situation. 
---
Other than end game however, it wouldn't really matter. So as you said, they could deactivate there and that would be it. There's nothing wrong with camping or tunneling when the gates are powered.
---
Why clown? I can see the rest of the killers though
---
I was going the opposite way.
---
I love the body and head but the weapon is kinda underwhelming and boring. Would look amazing with a blight weapon.. I hope she will get one.
---
Preach!
---
My internet is kinda unstable from time to time too, so unfortunately inconveniences can happen.
---
But trying to explain it in a logical manner, like you did, often doesn't work - people just scream "laG SWitcHer!!1!!!" and don't think any further than that. It's really annoying - I'm convinced there are just very few ACTUAL lag switchers going around in DbD! Most people who get accused probably just have some normal connection issues.
---
Bamboozle and PGTW
---
Imagine if you tunneled me with feral frenzy. Haha that would be so dumb...
---
...Unless? ;)
---
Freddy. Have you seen the NOES movies?
---
On which ranks though? Usually yellow and green ranks are good for killers, but purple starts being 3-5 minutes (10+ in rare cases like new killers or events) and red ranks being even worse.
---
He‚Äôs not wrong but he‚Äôs not right either only time will tell.
---
I'll show you how feral my frenzy can get ;)
---
Wait, African or European?
---
Yeah good perks
---
It looks like if dbd had a character creator and tried to make bo rai cho
---
Honestly sounds cool but I was literally sending a spap to someone and I was wearing a bucket hat and my hand was positioned in just the right way i was like ‚Äúwait, holt shit I look like Freddy‚Äù
---
There are teams of people breaking the game regularly and nothing is being done to address the issue from what I can find. SWF teams will run one person with OoO and using 3rd party voice chat tell everyone where the killer is at any time you glance in their general direction. This is not an isolated event either. Every time i run into this i'm going to post it.
---
Nah if I get tunneled I‚Äôm calling you the N word
---
I'm honestly surprised this wasn't about the matchmaking, sheesh.
---
Let's be real, the only perk us survivors need is Pharmacy. Best perk in the game I'll tell you what.
---
Okay but who cares if you miss a skillcheck just leave the area you missed a skillcheck in or just go to one of the alarm clocks? Lmao Jesus Christ
---
Yes, I agree. There are always cheating cocks who do use lag switches but people are far too quick to say they're using one. I don't even know how one works! Let alone where to get one or have it set up
---
Annoying to the point where 10+ people decided to go out their way to click the downvote? That's not what the button is even there for.
---
Reddit hivemind; people will bandwagon on votes if enough people are doing it.
---
No one is saying that? He was saying that the only resemblance is a common hair style
---
This is so sad, despacito: Play chase music
---
That's actually a good theory on why the demogorgon will come to DBD.
---
If you play a short killer like Hag or Pig, you just have to keep practising. Your lower set camera makes it way harder. Try to keep your camera up and not pointing at the ground, you can usually see the upper body and head of survivors as they move through corn. 
---
Otherwise, play tall killers like Plague. It‚Äôs much easier to see people from a higher vantage point. Or accept your corn blindness, like I have, and come to terms with the fact that you‚Äôll inevitably look like a rank 20 every time someone 360s you in the corn field. :(
---
Why tf do people get more BP on console than PC?
---
Lol that made me laugh
---
https://www.razorgloves.com/
---
That‚Äôs the website lol. Those are the best moments where you don‚Äôt try and tada! You did something cool to made something cool.
---
Whats with the arrow on the cake?
---
Gotta confirm a one time pass from my friend first tho
---
oh fuck i spelled it wrong
---
It's called an "appositive", FYI
---
https://data.grammarbook.com/blog/commas/commas-with-appositives/
---
I can tell, just trust me. I‚Äôm a Jake Main
---
Trapper is D tier. Hag at best is A or B tier wdym
---
What chapter are we on now?
---
If something make the game completely unfair then they should be taken out if the game. Sloppy butcher, Iron Maiden, and especially Premonition should all be taken out to start.
---
Damn. Were you born this stupid or is this a recent development?

I would love to know on what grounds.

Same here, but yeah, people are always quick to judge. Sadly and annoyingly.

How am I dumb for telling you that it is to late to start appreciating Freddy?

especially her broken ruler
---
You say "go out of their way" like it requires more than a modicum of effort lol. Also- I'm not saying that hive mind isn't a thing, but I like that you immediately jumped to the next excuse you could think of without acknowledging that maybe you were wrong.
---
So kill the OoO ?
---
Looking at the forums it also says you get a 24 hour, then 48 hour, one week and then a perma ban. I didn‚Äôt even get a 24 hour ban I got a week when it‚Äôs supposed to go in order. Still so confused.

I will be more aware of that in the future. Thanks!

Why is it so hard to make the Legion mask ‚Äúscary‚Äù?

I find most cosplays with it are always ever so slightly misshapen and off-proportion enough to the point that they just look silly/goofy instead of ‚Äúintimidating‚Äù
---
lol true mvp
---
Alright, what‚Äôs happened this time?
---
The raider rework is probably one of the best thing that has happened to the game. It's the result that we're shifting away from the turtle meta. Maybe his damage didn't deserve buff, but he's fine. He no longers need to dodge gb spam or turtle to win. He has offense and that's all he needed.
---
The player peaks are obviously not related to this raider rework, I'd rather say they're related to a lack of content by the game, or just the fact that it's not noob friendly, but frankly the game is better than ever now. 
---
Also centurion rework.
---
We dont care. Send a support ticket. We can't help you and this isn't the place to rant about it.
---
I see Keanu Reeves, I upvote.

where can i get one of these?

Because of the insane distance she covers with her vomit and the lunge when she hits
---
Had the same thing happen to me aswell I also had a game against a ghostface where I got insta targeted and the ghostface and the other survivors just t bagged in front of me until I died
---
thx
---
I gave up once. I was rank 19 one perk level 1 Trapper no addons, SWFs were teabagging me and flashlight saving with White Warded god flashlights when I didn't even know that was a thing. I went to hide in the basement. After game:
---
&gt;Toxic survivor: are you okay?
---
Hey, maybe you were right; we'll never know. Good thing it doesn't matter.
---
Shadow isn't accurate to the in-game ones tho
---
The killer in this game was also a ghostface but i guess I got my revenge when the jeff got the big mori and disconnected. It just confuses me why people act like this? And then if i report them nothing happens.
---
He's still a dude with a knife hand, even in the real world. He can't even be killed in reality, he just returns to the Dream World.
---
The only way Freddy's powers are focused in game is that he can force survivors to sleep. Other than that, the game version is a heavily reduced version of the film version's abilities.

He is fine he legit just came out and is A rank or at least B rank leave him be

Console, Myers is often played as a Nurse stand in from what I hear

Lol at "I've never deranked before I just want to see what it's like"
---
Douche with a capital Bag.
---
Don't open your eyes.
---
Just stay in the dream world please.
---
I'm just a killer, no time for sympathy.
---
If it‚Äôs Dwight or GROOVY Ash I give them escape all the time. And I give last people hatch
---
Better idea, git gud and quit crying. OoO is an advantage, yes. But guess what? You see them too.
---
If I'm teleporting to a gen, I'm not feigning it.
---
Holdup, with Smart Strike, that would mean killers would get stunned for OVER TEN SECONDS on a pallet stun?!
---
This is impossible! According to reddit bhvr never does anything! ^s
---
no there is no problem but it does not just change it with the game open
---
My comment better get a shit load of dislikes.
---
I wanted to see if anyone else had a similar problem it‚Äôs the reason I posted it. Seems you do care considering you took the time to read and comment. If you‚Äôre going to be rude just keep it to yourself
---
The only thing I care about is how you camped the God pallet. But no seriously wtf happened
---
That‚Äôs what happens when you camp aswell. 
---
In both chasing a survivor or camping, you are occupying 1 survivor. Yet chasing rewards more bp and is imo more fun. 
---
But in both scenarios, you leave the other 3 survivors to do gens.
---
I give hatch to the ones that don‚Äôt wiggle, the hopeless, the defeated. At that point I already won. Unless of course they were toxic lol
---
Why do people want the Demogorgon so much? What would the lore even be? The creature works as a low level threat in the first season, but look at it this way;
---
The Demogorgon isn't a human being, nor has ever been. It doesn't have anything for the Entity to manipulate or bargain with. Also, its power really couldn't work. It works in Stranger Things because its a tv show, but in game, any power that would remain true to the Demogorgon would just be a timewasting gimmick.
---
I'd not hate if we got it, it just feels like a strange choice, especially considering the Demogorgon was just a feral beast from the Upside Down.
---
And thats when I start slugging
---
I've yet to meet a single shirtless David that didn't have it coming. They're always toxic little shits in my experience.
---
Dig deep. You did something. Think.... What was it..... Hmmm.....
---
I didn't! In the developers' native French, they use the feminine form of the word.
---
I don't get it either man, seems like some people are literally just out to annoy the crap out of others :( sux
---
The other way around. It's a bug that causes lag. Basically it desyncs you from the killer, so you run away "offline" while your "online" version stands still. After the bug is over the game unfucks itself and sets you back to your online position
---
WAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZUP
---
Damn someone already said it
---
I would play Feng, lithe is a decent perk, technician helps with gens and alert helps keep track of the killer, the spare perk (if they would exist) is spine chill.
---
if i killed the other 3 and the last one is downed i give the hatch. Also i give the hatch for the lucky people who get the 4% hook escape
---
I really can‚Äôt think of anything. The only thing would be leaving games but I rarely do that either like one out of every 50 or something
---
Old Mcdonald had a ....
---
With the Obsession perk its a SWF KNOWING they're going to win because they'll have wallhacks and just evade the killer all game. They're abusing the Exploit to farm bp.
---
I'm talking about more from a survivor perspective.
---
Entity offers food bam demogordon happy killer
---
I feel like camping with cannibal now
---
Respect, but if someone is being toxic I will try to not escape while not being a tunneller.
---
It's not being outplayed that causes rage, it's when they feel like cheap tactics got them to lose.
---

I guess disconnecting might be it although I rarely do it. I had to do it recently because of the storms that kept shutting my internet off and I live in the south. Thanks for being nice and suggesting what I did wrong instead of being rude about it
---
dbd community is toxic, simple as that.
---
kinda unrelated to this but I was playing last night against a wraith and he hooked me, then facecamped me for no reason. while doing so, he kept hitting me like a pi√±ata the whole time till there was a sliver of time left before the entity took me and a fellow survivor finally came and rescued me. 
---
now free, I started to work on gens. wraith tunneled me multiple times and I evaded each time and this gave my team time to complete all gens. then, once all gens were done and we were all on the verge of opening the gates, THE WRAITH QUIT GAME.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why the dude had it out for me but whatever, he was toxic then took the L. and there are a bunch of killer out there that play like that unfortunately.
---
Just wait until the rift comes out. We‚Äôll get SOMETHING on the two. But no technically there is four. We‚Äôre talking about lore.
---
Pretty sure that's accurate
---
It's a perk bud.
---
Killers aren't a RACE. They're (mostly) all humans. If the criteria for a Killer is "a human capable of killing and willing to do so for the Entity," then ANY Survivor could turn Killer with the proper mindset. If going insane is good enough for Wraith, why gatekeep Dwight?
---
You're backpedaling if body count is now relevant, since you said just having the potential to kill is enough, but Susie didn't even want to kill anyone, and her victim may well have been dead before she touched the knife. Not that I'd say unwittingly killing someone counts towards someone's character. If Dwight's car spun out one night and he hit someone, is he now a valid Killer?
---
Oh, okay. 
---
Yeah, those are kinda lame and not very rewarding (in both bp and feeling).  
---
Altho I try to do gens as much as possible, I‚Äôm not ignoring totems and other survivors (that need healing or saving).
---
Why would the entity have to bargain with the demogorgon it is literally a bloody thirsty Hunter it would be a perfect fit for the entity also BHVR is so inconsistent with the damn lore I don't even think you need to be human to be taken by the entity also yes the ability would be gimmicky but itd be really interesting. The only reason people want it is because they(Netflix) made a partnership with BHVR and everyone is hoping for the demogorgon
---
Id rather be saved then know that the survivors didn't want to save me.
---
Unless they are camping. Then I'll gladly die
---
I only swing early with Spirit. It might just be me, but unless I‚Äôm coming out of phase to lunge, her lunge feels incredibly underwhelming.
---
**Pros**: Not only do they have some really high rank players, they also have the advantage of voice comms, so of course they should be matched with a killer that's of a similar rank to their very best player.
---
**Cons: "**Ok buddy I'm going to teach you how to play Dead by Daylight, let's join a lobby together and I'll help you learn the ropes. Ok, so here we have a 5-blink nurse with ebony mori because I'm rank 2 but don't worry, it'll be a good introduction to the game for you."
---
Makes me wonder why the Killers put up with it. Survivors are just trapped and hunted, but the Killers can pretty much tell the Entity to shove it at any time and it's too weak to really fight them on it. At best, it could send other Killers.
---
nobody will survive the tetanus she inflicts, oooo spooky
---
&gt;He's still a dude with a knife hand
---
That's the coolest weapon ever.
---
&gt;Other than that, the game version is a heavily reduced version of the film version's abilities.
---
Yeah, I remember what he did in Freddy Vs Jason. Still though, what about just game counterparts?
---
Ahhhhhh the old spagatti
---
Dead by Sega Genesis
---
&gt;Lore wise.
---
Here's a tip:  
---
if you are the last to get hooked after a devastating 4k, don't wiggle. I notice immediately &amp; will take you on a nice tour around the map, with the destination being of course the hatch
---
Come play with meee!
---
fucking weirdo
---
I‚Äôm sure they could probably reuse some existing cosmetics and allow the skin/hair color to be changed
---
Very much so.
---
Regarding original killers, probably Nurse, yeah.
---
Unpopular opinion: survivors choosing perks and items that help them complete their objective quickly is literally as acceptable as killers choosing perks and addons that help them kill people better.
---
Only toxic M1 killer‚Äôs hook survivors!!!11!!2
---
Those are some Really Nice Teammates.
---
The better question is why does it take 30 minutes to get through one bloodweb. Should be an option to have an auto buy button so i dont have to sit in my bloodweb for 30 minutes using my million bp.
---
A lot of streamers have their own community that wants to be toxic and you can't say anything, they are even fog wisperers
---
spongebob has a scene for everything
---
I think that the non teachable perks could still be in the game, but yeah she‚Äôs decent. I would use resilience tbh or we‚Äôll make it
---
WAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZUP!
---
Gimme your name I'll add rn I'm playing lol
---
Actually Ghostface wasn't persuaded he actually went in without bargaining just happiness that he could kill(also entity can manipulate it's thought process maybe or since I believe it's a give mind the entity could force it to hook people) also it could be something else that you could use to hook them besides the hook which would be interesting. The ability be could be it could make rifts on walls to teleport to certain areas. I feel if they did anything or else for a stranger things killer it'd just be boring as we have so many killers that use knifes and cleavers etc.
---
Side note, Grunkle Stan for new DBD survivor
---
Sure that sounds awesome :) I usually solo que all the time. I will add you , my gt is Iwantzwaffle

Does it matter if it follows the rules it‚Äôs dbd we‚Äôre talking about here if it walks on two legs has two arms and can reach the hook then who cares?
---
Happy birthday
---
Time Baby for new killer
---
Universal Meme source
---
Yeah, i love when they call you out for using game mechanics like setting a trap by hanging one of their friends in the basement and patrolling the surrounding generators. CAMPER!
---
Spine chill is a life saver.
---
It does matter though, considering that's a pretty set rule within the lore, hence Trapper having hooks inside his back.
---
I remembered it because it was hilarious to me that the biggest Gun media apologist is garbage at the game he spends hours defending on reddit for no financial compensation.
---
Ah alright. Not too knowledgeable on this particular bug or game programming as a whole.
---
I don‚Äôt see the appeal to it? It just seems like resilience but only when the killer looks at you (with the increase in skillchecks)

Ash is the loudest in the game, no contest.
---
I had a match where I was chasing a nea as ghost face and after I got the first hit, she stop dead in her tracks and sold out an ash repairing a gen. I think about that sometimes
---
Watch pain relievers
---
Yea, I mean it‚Äôs so toxic to not let them freely unhook their friend in the basement after you went through the trouble of carrying them down there!!!!1!12 /s
---
r/whoosh
---
They‚Äôre refusing to participate in normal gameplay, which is a reportable offense.
---
You feel bad because... she sucks?
---
Go ahead and waste your karma lol, you don‚Äôt really have any substance in your argument here. Swf is a game mode, discord is a whitelisted application, and OoO is a perk. You can‚Äôt report people and expect them to get banned for things that are officially approved and already in bhvr.
---
Ikr
---
Fair enough, glad you're still enjoying the game in a different way!
---
Do people in this reddit even know how to make memes?
---
Exactly, killing survivors means you‚Äôre toxic!
---
I wish they would buff the distance
---
I think the major implication here is that it is either the game being broken, or that the killer was lag switching. This might have prompted the above comment
---
Farming isn't normal gameplay, and that's not reportable. You're not gonna get anywhere with this.
---
This is how I learned to stop using borrowed time.
---
I also love how sadistic we all sound playing the killer.
---
Not the killers following the rules the rules in general like as we know the killer has to be humanoid that‚Äôs it plus demogordon could make a good pet
---
In the show the Demogorgons are a race of beings that have been enslaved by a shadowy entity (named the Mind Flayer by the kids) that uses them as slaves essentially. It can control them when needed. It also does so with rats and humans too. 
---
How does not that fit the lore of DbD? Just replace the Mind Flayer with the entity. Boom. Ez fix.
---
Username... does not check out
---
It‚Äôs still a stupid RNG perk, so it can‚Äôt even be counted on as a serious counter to him.
---
may I use this for my background game?
---
No cause she accidentally dropped the pallet in front of her self
---
This is not something that needs to be removed. It's a visual effect that's completely seperate from Freddy's kit. This is like saying that because Sprint Burst got nerfed Meg's not allowed to be a redhead anymore.
---
Iwantzwaffle lol but also I kinda have a trash can mic :'( so I don't want to bother anyone
---
It's funny I encountered a Feng earlier with OoO while playing GhostToast. Y'know what I did? I sacrificed them and kept playing the game normally.
---
Killer: Ohhhhhh It's your birthday? I'm. . . I'm sorry to intrude. I didn't mean to try and ruin your birthday. Well. . . uh. . . happy birthday! I'll leave you be.
---
Few seconds later.
---
Killer: Oh, and just to clarify I will come back tomorrow to hook you just so we're clear okay byeeee.
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZUP

---
Definitely Trapper, he can literally HIT and KILL survivors.
---
I propose keeping Huntress at 110% as long as she has any hatches abd bumping her to 115% once she completely runs out.
---
Really??? I only got 25k each.
---
I'm not 100% sure since I never got this bug but that's what I guessed from the way OP described it. If a lag happens consistently when you do a specific action, it's usually becouse said action causes a desync
---
For real, why tf do so many people still crash while loading a match? And the bugged 3 surv lobbies? Like everyone gets this and it‚Äôs not a hardware issue. 
---
These are bugs that have been around for ages and instead of fixing the crashing they just made it so that the match doesn‚Äôt even begin after you have to wait for it to load...
---
Well damn when did you do it
---
How does this happen?
---
Yeah, and so did Myers. He's a human being, with human processes.
---
If the Entity could manipulate thought processes, it wouldn't have to look for murderers throughout history, it could just force people to kill. Why bother bringing in The Demogorgon when a pissed off Bulldog could do the same job?
---
Right as I saw the post. Maybe I'm just on crack and didn't notice but I thought it gave 25k.
---
You kinda proved my point = one won mind game and you win the chase that‚Äôs so powerful and then you can glide the next generator and down a guy really fast Billie has upsets especially if you miss a chainsaw it‚Äôs a huge set back where as spirit they‚Äôre never too far away or at ‚Äútoo strong‚Äù of a loop
---
Good teammates doing what they should but with regards to the tunnel comment. It's end game it's the killers best option to go after who is going to die. But kudos to the team for getting you out! Too many just leave and do nothing.
---
Ghostface always stabs buttholes.
---
Its just me or this meme seems recolored to be in Full HD
---
People will say about any killer that is OP, but that doesn't mean anything. From PTB I saw that the Dream Pallets aren't as effective as people say, you still get looped before you can use them and survivors seems to adapt to them, like they don't fall for them that easy anymore. Most people seems think that Dream Snares are trash and I think that their only use is to stop fast windows vaults and that's it, maybe they can help you to counter strong buildings like the ones from Ironworks of Misery or Rancid Abbatoir, but other than that, I don't think they gonna help you too much.
---
He doesn't deserve to be called baby dwight or dwight in my opinion.
---
‚ÄúRefusing to participate in normal gameplay‚Äù is literally a reportable offense. Everyone else was trying to play except for this person. The devs have said farming is not bannable, and this wasn‚Äôt farming. Also, by this persons own statements, they implied they‚Äôve done this enough times to get from red rank to yellow rank, meaning they‚Äôre consistently sabotaging games.
---
I care
---
The customisation would probably be lame
---
I did it when the tutorial came out
---
Thats fine üòÇ
---
Someone left a mark with a map.
---
I've been against a 4 man swf all running it. Pulled a 3k, 4th disconnected. Granted, they were dumb enough to get close to the basement, and continuously go for saves. I also run spies from the shadows, thrilling tremors, and I'm all ears so it's pretty easy for me to counter alot once people start rushing around. Either way, OP needs to git gud if hes going to flip over 1 person running OoO and someone running a bp bonus that benefits him also.
---
even if this is satire, the devs confirmed they were looking into making bunny feng a real thing? There's been a few posts about it. The big issue holding them up was a need to rework the whole cosmetics system and it's something they said they were looking into?
---
Oh okay so maybe it's nerfed to 25k each now and I'm not crazy.
---

I think it's a phone game thing, but defs hoping for some DBD crossover.
---
Like how is it even pulled off? Can I do it in custom game?
---
The thing is that 1/3 of this is not mentally insane and she is only changed by the master legion and the netity
---
Yeah it was pretty much ‚Äú here have these blood points and have a amazing start‚Äù
---
You know she sacrificed a lot of people right
---
That's a really shitty thing to say. Talking like autism is something you can "catch", or that should be feared, I don't understand why you would needs to be so rude on a Reddit post of all things.
---
What if the character model blocks the ghostface reveal?
---
I have no idea. As far as I know it can be done in any game mode
---
That is true.   Totally spaced on that part XD
---
No of course not. I just wasn't sure if you were being for real lol
---
In fact, you're running 2 detection perks on your build as is. 1 person using OoO isnt a big deal at that point.
---
Never really understood why people bother with all of the made up rules in DbD. Just play the game the way you want to play it, and have fun.
---
People take DbD way too seriously man.
---
Once is a courtesy, twice is BM, three times and you're just beating your meat.
---
Still, there's pretty much 0 chance they'll be banned.
---
And here's post number 203 on this topic.
---
I was asking if I could report on the DBD service website because I‚Äôm on console, not on PC, not if they will immediately be banned.
---
Because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to throw a pallet on a bulldog I would feel too bad.
---
One won mind game is true for Billy as well. Same thing for the "down one guy and fly to the next one." Lmao the only difference is that Spirits power doesn't go from one end of the map to the other, has a power guage to manage, and can be used against her way better than Billy's can. 
---
If Spirit DOES end up getting nerfed in any field that isn't prayer beads then Billy should get nerfed too. He's easier and iirc more commonly seen in red ranks than Spirit.
---
False report.
---
I get OoO is annoying as hell, but just tunnel and facecamp the Obsession if it bothers you.
---
This is not the way to handle it.
---
We're fairly new to the game, didnt know.
---
Oh thanks now I feel like an absolute idiot lol
---
Sure do what ever you want with it
---
Rin is the embodiment of fury and wrath now tho
---
You would think they would have fixed this already. Been pointing this out since the End game collapse. . .
---
Cuts right before Bubba downs them.
---
Pig = upvote. Oink!
---
fight The Man, man!
---
I don‚Äôt like playing either and I only think spirit should be nerfed billies chainsaw is easy to use against him like how a huntress winds her hatchet
---
It says that no where in the lore. The closest thing to that is her cutting off her own toe in an attempt to cure a sick woman.
---
I actually play Dwight because I feel like his pain grunts are the quietest. At least until I get Iron Will.
---
I have very mild ocd
---
One game i was hag there was a 3 man then someone saw this and just decided dc for this and i felt super bad cuz someone brought in this purple toolbox and i just decided not to put them on hooks so they have a higher chance of rescue but that really wqsnt enough so i just lest them do all the gens and escape and i didnt de pip as i used my traps to gain points by spamming them around gens so after they finish i get somewhere around 1200 points and it would start a chase and find survivors giving me an additional 800 points so we were all happy in the end
---
Good point but I think a survivor could just punt the bulldog rather then a creature from another plane of existence and I think it only takes truly hateful or evil people like the Trapper and Ghostface but honestly the lore is so weird like oh I'm not going to takes this convenient store worker that's dying but I'll take a old army veteran that's on the brink of dying and a somehow Ash gets sucked through a rift which puts him in the entity realm which wasn't even stated in the damn lore(I get he's licensed but still atleast say that in the damn lore)
---
Satan walks the earth and this is the first thing he did
---
lmao, i wish. i evaded him for a little longer after that but they weren‚Äôt 360s. he eventually downed me though with his mallet and then i got farmed.
---
Haha I didn't know what it was the first time I saw it either
---
This is nonsense. The likelihood that another survivor is within close range when another is down is slim. 
---
What's likely is that the killer goes back and forth to the hook like a facsimile machine with nothing better to do that safe unhook is practically impossible. Then the killer will tunnel the unhooked person. Trash and scummy.
---
If they're SWF, the teammates can easily avoid you.
---
My Nea was like level 15 at the item.
---
Goddammit, he's getting ready to mark me isn't he
---
As the trapper: figure a way to solve world hunger while training to become Batman and bring balance to the force
---
The problem is, skilled or unskillful, the majority of the time you lose to bullshit in this game. It rarely ever feels like you just got outplayed, which is a problem I absolutely think the devs need to address. When I lose, I like to lose because my opponent was just better then me, not because they had NOED, full SWF, camping, tunneling, instaheals, etc.
---
And you said why it would be poorly designed for x reasons, noed fits that reason
---
wait you didn't have monitor or shadowborn is the fov just naturally higher on mobile?
---
No I meant like he didn‚Äôt go after anyone else the entire game. During our first chase he chased me around for five minutes then didn‚Äôt care to attack anyone else after that.
---
Literally what happened to Noob3
---
Yeah it was a hard bullet to bite. I started playing the day it was released on console. And just started on PC this April.
---
You can't use the chainsaw against Billy. He doesn't have to commit to it.
---
Unfortunately she didn't have the mask with her and she didnt oink, but she is super friendly though!
---
She had the munchies.
---
I think he's only labeled hard because he is very easy to gen rush because he has no generator pressure but yeah the difficulty ratings are so weird like the nurse is considered hard while hag is intermediate.
---
People only complain because they love. The moment you stop seeing complaints, it's sign the game is dying.
---
Technically, the devs never intended people to have voice chat. They just can't do anything about it.
---
OoO has always been OP when used by SWF, but almost no-one used it prior to Ghostface.
---
Ahhh I see. Yeah that sucks. Hurt him I'm the long run which is good
---

---
Maybe if the Freddy is doing silly double pallets, sure it's going to lose its effectiveness, but to say that they're not that good isn't giving the power too much credit. While a survivor can be keen to figuring out which pallets have and haven't been used, it's safe to say the vast majority are not masterminds and are likely to die due to them. All in all, I expect the dreamworld to get you royally fucked, so it's good to have a strategy against it. And the community typically wines saying that a killer sucks or is OP, and in this case they're leaning towards the latter, so here's a strategy.
---
I mean, you'd think an army veteran could fight a small teenage girl too, so doubt they could just punt a bulldog. 
---
Your theory on them only taking hateful or evil people is flawed because it took Plague.
---
The Entity takes people with the capacity to act as murderers, either because they enjoy it, they're insane, they're easily manipulated, or they're full of hate.
---
Oh my fault I ain't see that well then in terms of lore it ghostface or mike
---
I had a game with 2 Claudettes where one just hid in on the boat on the swamp map the whole time. Then when I was downed and while the billy was chasing someone else one of them just tbagged me on the floor the whole time. Finally healing me just as billy came back to hook me. Then after they unhooked me the 2 of them pined me into a corner while the billy came back. 
---
I literally did 2 gens and started getting chased by billy...I don‚Äôt even know what I did. I was fuming and confused. 
---
Another game I came out with the spirit and a jake just starting ranting racial slurs. I can swear on my life I didn‚Äôt see him all game. Wtf?
---
Yeah I think it's hilarious that they even bothered to "buff" it with the EGC patch. Just ignore it and hope it goes away like you normally do BHVR, you'd be much better off.
---
I don‚Äôt know know why every multi player game has to be so toxic now a days it‚Äôs just for fun but people make it their mission to either make sure you don‚Äôt have fun or they just ruin the game by last second dc‚Äôing so you can‚Äôt get the win you deserve
---
I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt sometimes work against him, but there are other ways to counter him. Technician isn‚Äôt going to be an end all be all meta perk.

In his dream world he is pretty strong. When he is pulled out of the dream to the real world he is still dangerous. He is stronger than a normal human and can take hits that would kill a normal human (he got his head cut off and that didn't kill him). Even if 'killed' in the real world, he just go back to the dream. Only way to weaken him is to make people forget about him and even that didn't work because dude is very good with manipulating and was able to make everyone remember him and powered himself up again.

This shit happened to me a few days ago I was like ‚ÄúWhy the hell are you getting off the gen?‚Äù And I got yanked by Myers.
---
Reminds me of a enemy out of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice.
---
Hey, it happens on survivor too. In the last game i had an omega blinking nurse both tunnel and camp the first hook at ten five.
---
*^^Nature's ^^equilbrium ^^is ^^not ^^evil*
---
This pretty much happened to me on my second night of playing.  I got off the hook and in my amazement, I was just standing there and got knocked down and rehooked.  Now I know to at least run away from the hook.
---
If you are the last person alive at the end of the trial, gain increased interaction speed with chests, health kits, gen repair (if you want to be greedy for bloodpoints) , vaulting and lockers
---
Wazzzzuuuuppp
---
But the Ghostface identity itself is still a license owned by Fun World that BHVR had to buy. Just because it isn‚Äôt movie Ghostface doesn‚Äôt mean the character isn‚Äôt licensed.
---
I‚Äôm a PS4 killer and I play clown, so you have at least some possibility to survive :))

Send you a request too. I‚Äôm rank 16 and looking for others to swf. Psn is juicycherub
---
That's the mindset of the habitual DCer. Get downed, get mad at everyone even though it's directly their own fault, DC and learn nothing. Repeat at rank 10 for life.
---
Well currently with the new PTB, head on is glitched and you can like stun the killer multiple times and kind of create an area where the killer gets stunned if he walks into certain area. And then thete's mad grit which lets you spam M1 while carrying someone to move much faster while also hitting people.

Yeah but that‚Äôs a small licence that‚Äôs not gonna cost millions, and wouldn‚Äôt need constant copyright approvals to make cosmetics

Legion characters as actual survivors, maybe as a sort of AU legion

We cannot accept that all cosmetics are cannon.
---
Frankly, default Shock distance is so dang low I find it not worth the bother to use it in a normal chase. Only against people just standing next to a barely-safe pallet.

You do know how this works, right? BHVR can‚Äôt just make whatever they want for Ghostface without any approval- they have to run it through the license holders to make sure it isn‚Äôt damaging or misrepresenting the property. Large license or not, Ghostface is still a licensed killer.
---
Nothing like a little tag-team
---
Dude, I just explained the lore to you. It's very evidently not wonky in regards to why The Entity chooses people.
---
Besides, you're completely off topic to my original point. I never stated that they CAN'T add the Demogorgon, I simply stated that it's an incredibly odd choice, and that I imagine his power will be too gimmicky.
---
Oh em gee!!! he can freakin inSTadowN, PLS nerf BHvr!!!
---
Ignoring him doesn't stop the fact that they regularly update their whole team on where you're at.
---
The ‚ÄúHEEYAH‚Äù they do when wiggling is ingrained in my brain
---
Fair enough
---
Meh Imo when you do an asymetrical multiplayer game, you can make it fair, to a point. It is normal to feel frustrated, but imo, the dude who created this thread isn't saying "guys stop doing threads because you've seen a frustrating pattern that could be fixed with logical arguments and yet won't unbalance the game", he is saying something like "guys, you are frustrated, you lost, but why 1/2 thread is about nerfs or buffs you want bhvr to make? It is just because you cant accept to lose sometimes".
---
I've seen so much ppl trying to "balance" the game, and yet proposed 90% nerfs on killers and 10% on survivors, or the contrary. They just want to win more. And yet they blame the devs, and call the game shitty and stuff.
---
But I'll check your threads, I'm curious to see what an actual game designer could propose. I've also seen many interesting threads on this sub, that could actually improve the game imo.
---
Damn that sounds incredibly scary, I'm sorry that happened. Also I've began taking the DCs while survivors are dying on hook with a grain of salt on XB1 lately, because recently when I was playing survivor it said I was disconnected from the host a couple times after I'd been killed on the hook before it was completed, despite the killer not disconnecting even though it's what it shows me at the end game results
---
There is always that odd team that does gens for your first two states and saves you last second, but yeah any save is a good save I guess haha.
---
The scream made it more funny
---
I don‚Äôt mean to sound harsh but why you got alien arms?
---
I‚Äôm looking right at the picture and can‚Äôt seem to break him out of his Stealthü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's not the point, in general you want to avoid going into the dreamworld and that failing a skill check is an effective way to reset the timer, it comes at the cost of a sound notification though. Searching for the clock and trying to search for others to be woken up is a huge waste of time. Running technician helps out with that a LOT. Just try it.
---
I‚Äôve tried to give the hatch more than I‚Äôve actually given it. If you‚Äôre the last survivor and I‚Äôm violently shaking my camera after picking you up, stop fucking wiggling you nonce.

Fair enough, that is why so many people try their best to stay in lower ranks. Once you hit red ranks if you are not playing either nurse spirit or billy the survivors will dumpster you, and if they don't they rage and if they do they gloat like survivor is the hardest thing in the world to play.  
---
But if BHVR actually made killers powerful the survivors would just whine until they got nerfed/killers would whine because they queues would be so long.
---
I‚Äôm a pretty low rank right now(18 because of some bad matches before getting out of the low ranks) and let me tell you no one knows what Discordance is. They‚Äôll quad a gen when i‚Äôve attacked them there before because they really want that one and then split and duo two gens. Once i get to higher ranks again(highest of all time was on an alt at 11) i probably won‚Äôt be able to do it but it‚Äôs funny while it lasts.
---
Or...you could use the power of two human eyes and ears. If a person says "the killer is on me", then what exactly is the point of running object to notify everyone of your position. People use object for the sole reason of distracting you and making you chase them at the cost of giving up their position. I don't know when all of a sudden people have found object to be op. I remember when it was considered trash.

I saw survivors baiting hatchets at high walls loops even with these add-ons equipped. It's not impossible. Unless hit boxes play a role there, broken hit boxes are literally the only thing that saves Huntress in this game, maps just got so worse for her ...
---
Because it‚Äôs also against the rules under support posts.
---
Or shirtless Michael (although, no homo, I personally want shirtless nea)
---
So you acknowledge that they've been nerfing survivors to make the game more balanced and that you're able to stay at the top rank with mid-low tier killers, but you're still going to complain about survivors getting "handicap after handicap"? 
---
So how easy does the game need to be for you to keep it installed?
---
DbD was made with spaghetti code because the devs never thought it would get this popular. That means it's horrendously difficult to change anything in the game without a million other things going wrong, that's why they take so long to fix stuff.
---
WAAAAZZZZZZZUP
---
thank you
---
Lol ok bye
---
It‚Äôs not just that they were ‚Äúsuiciding‚Äù it‚Äôs that they said themself that they were intentionally deranking by throwing matches.
---
Did you even check their friends list? They were probably not even SWF. Burning a cake does not mean SWF.
---
Toxic
---
Watching doin son?
---
When you outplay the game its not so bad, but when the game outplays you.  
---
They do need to fix that though.
---
No I understand but that‚Äôs essentially the same thing as suiciding. It‚Äôs not bannable unless they‚Äôre ‚Äògriefing‚Äô which is when they start sandbagging teammates and helping the killer.
---
I'll just tack more onto your handicap argument. It's absolutely stupid that survivors can literally make a second-chance build, and all four of them can run one at the same time. So much for the devs' nerf to the old tank build. Survivors are still too strong, and SWF has been needing a ginormous nerf for quite a while now but the devs have done nothing about it.
---
Wait what? Why?

Oh yea, I didn‚Äôt mean this one sided, but I feel like survivors do a bit more shit talking on this sub. It seems like toxic survivors talk more, while toxic killers play more lol
---
How?
---
75% battery is yellow?
---
Truth, truth. What‚Äôs your main?
---
But it doesn't equal bad
---
The most powerful for me is probably Myers or Ghostface. The scariest to go against is Myers because he‚Äôs just down right creepy but Ghostface is probably the most difficult for me to beat.
---
I don't. 90% of the time they can protection hit and it benefits both of us
---
You'd think you would since he's so new but all I see are spirits and freddy's
---
&gt; Lol ok bye
---
After I helped you by directing you to a place to look for groups.

---
I'd be surprised if this wasn't a troll comment
---
I don't, I blame the map aswell.
---
What about overwatch? I‚Äôm a soldier main?
---
I beg u shutup now honestlyüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Caaaaarl that kills people!
---
I mean, kinda, if I get tunneled/camped ill be salty. But then I just go to the next game because I got unlucky. After multiple games in a row of it, I usually stop playing for a bit like how in other games if you get 3 losses it is usually best to step away from it for a bit. And as survivors, you have tools to combat it and worst-case scenario just do gens if someone is getting camped/tunneled.
---
I don't want another licenced chapter tbh, just want something original.
---
Yep i like it too but its the meme so who am i to go against the grain
---
Playing mercy,but I used to play 76
---
I've had the same luck rank 4 soloqueue survivor.  Last 6 games straight have been tunneling Ebony Mori Spirit, basement camping ebony Mori Iri head Huntress, 4 blink noed Nurse, hardcamping, tunnel Clown with Pinky Finger who slugs and bm's with bottle spam animation, Mint Rag ebony mori Hag, Proxycanlmping Hard tunnel off hook Spirit who ignored every other survivor to focus me down for running her at the same pallet for an inexcusable amount of time due to terrible play and the refusal to use ability on her part.  They were all so sweaty and some resorting to BM.  I don't teabag or play disrespectful, just loop and attempt to survive.  I had to switch to killer to relax lol.  That's saying some shit.
---
How can you tell whos toxic before post-game chat?
---
It looks like she's holding a Chinese take out container on a chain
---
Repeating a post I saw before  
---
"If your SWF comms sound like a military operation you need to chill out and go outside."
---
Does leaving the item actually give the killer anything or is it just to show your appreciation? I know it's a thing and I once left a toolbox for a plague who let me escape and she thanked me for it post-game, but I don't know if it's actually "worth" anything
---
Thank you! Hope she gets many more and posts them all.  I can paint models pretty decent, sadly that‚Äôs as fair as my artistic side goes. I can‚Äôt draw a stick figure to save my life üòÇ  so glad I got to meet you folks.  Happy gaming!
---
I really hope they don't nerf him.
---
What's the reddit called
---
Lol HUH? I only ever get toxic messages from survivors, almost never from the killer
---
Totally meant to post that under the main post, my bad
---
looping the Cannibal on Blood Lodge for 4 minutes while my teammates get only 1 gen done without ruin is absolutely worth complaining about. Especially when I do 3 gens by myself and have to lose due to my teammates fucking up.  
---
Other than that I agree.
---
She's not crap
---
Imo you should be able to use glitches on the PTB
---
It's really terribly weak. Even with the range add-ons the charge time is increased by so much that more often than not you lose more distance.
---
Don't forget spawn point and overall rng. Then theres the connection and lag. And if needed, my Damn stupid controller why wouldn't it register the shoulder button. Need to buy a new one.
---
"Fair compensation for all killers!"
---
Well if my other changes go through than you can probably win before the endgame because the matches will be longer.
---
And I just don't like the design behind those endgame perks , Adrenaline has the idea of being a well designed perk your betting that you'll make it to the end in exchange for a perk slot , but in practise there's no counter play other than kill all the survivors before the generators are done. And if I touch noed , i'm gonna touch Adrenaline.
---
And noed shouldn't exist to carry weaker killers (especially when it can be used on stronger killers). Why not  buff the weaker killer.
---
i absolutely love huntresses snow ram skin :D
---
Doctor DCs are sadly not uncommon
---
Kotal Kahn back at it again
---
Is this your own design?
---
I'm gonna tell him.
---
Change sometimes to most of the time
---
What the fuck kind of cursed clip is this? What even happened im so lost
---
My head canon is that Susie assumes everyone else has a knife too and she‚Äôs just trying to defend herself.
---
Myers? No. Spirit.
---
He brings a similar touch as Mike with his stalking and stealth mode to come out of nowhere and he's intimidating
---
Lol, initially I imagined this like the mortal kombat fatality dude speaking whenever someone ducks out. "Toxic meg has left the chat"....
---
Feng said "üëÅüôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
---
Yeah and it‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôm only a level 12 survivor main and he‚Äôs really not that hard to counterü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
nah it is 33%
---
&gt; And noed shouldn't exist to carry weaker killers (especially when it can be used on stronger killers). Why not buff the weaker killer.
---
Because back in the games early days, noed wasn‚Äôt a perk. It was  INBUILT into every killer. It was a mandatory game mechanic. That‚Äôs why we have weak killers now.
---
Or it screams that they need to make better perks? The main survivor meta is all old perks because they‚Äôre worth using. The meta for killers has changed a lot from a year ago because some newer perks have been strong enough to use for serious gameplay, while all the new survivor perks have been basically memes or weaker versions of old perks. You run perks that work, not shit perks. What do you use on killer? Guarantee it‚Äôs a build of the strongest meta perks and you don‚Äôt change them lol nobody does until another strong perk comes out.
---
Doesn‚Äôt do anything but take your item away lol
---
it's not about how difficult the game is. It's about how toxic people are. I play both roles I just prefer the challenge of killer bc survivor is super easy. If you have a team that's not completely potato you give the killer 1 good chase and it's gg. As a killer you're pressured from the very start of the match till the end.   
---
I've reported several teammates as survivor bc they were tbagging at exit gates or pallets. For some reason people think it's ok to be huge assholes to the killer. \*cough jendenise cough\* angrypug\* cough.   
---
It's absolutely shitty to troll people especially when you KNOW you're playing the real power role.
---
Cosplays please me.
---
thats a good start, i also think think that BHVR should alter his cone a bit, i remember that survivors would shove their face into my chest in order to "dodge" the shock, maybe make the cone's start at his heels? or maybe make the space in front of him like his sniping add on then it spreads into the cone.
---
my other solution which would be more satisfying imo, is having an alternate power to his shock, maybe even his punishment mode, where he just straight up punches the survivor if they are in melee range, it gets them into a madness tier and prevents them from cheeseing the shock attack.
---
having it in punishment mode would give the Doc more options in a chase, if he's chasing a tier 2 he could punch them to go to tier 3 then continue the chase, i would say the punch would act like his weapon and would be effected by perks related to his weapon.

I definitely don't respect pallets as much as I should, so it stings when I swing and miss without a pallet drop. It hurts especially cuz 80% of the time I don't get the hit when they actually do drop the pallet.
---
With a name like BallerMcBallerson it sounds like you are prone to talking a lot of shit post game lol.  Honestly I'm kind of kidding I don't know you but every PS4 player I know with Baller in their name are usually toxic caricatures made to crudely resemble a survivor.  The same goes for King, God, and DaGreatest,
---
No it wasn't , unless your getting at some weird inaccurate metaphor?
---
Freddy never had noed built into him it took up a perk slot just like everything else.
---
Something something different teams
---
I‚Äôm meeting her in September! I‚Äôm so excited üñ§üñ§
---
Console Meta changed? Neato. Former PC player, I just gathered Console from other people describing their meta.
---
Wraith doesn't have a TP or traps that slow or pallets that bamboozle. He runs at the same speed as Freddy so theoretically they should perform the same while being looped, but even with Freddy's dream snares, if you position them correctly you can make an entire loop useless to a survivor. And the pallets are counterable if you stay awake, so if you stay asleep all game you will never know what pallets are real or not, and at lower ranks like below 4 you can easily get a free hit for every dream pallet a survivor tries to use in a chase.   
---
There are plenty of killers that don't nearly come close to him in potential power, Trapper, Legion, Leather Face, even Pig to a point. But at the very least even if he is just mid-tier he is no longer a meme and he is hella fun.
---
Hey! Least she got that daily done!
---
For Corrupt Intervention I'd like to see them remove the timer and unlock 1 generator after each generator is completed. Thus it would limit the survivor's options for starting gens and slowly open up as they complete other gens while not putting another timer in the game to keep track of.
---
welp here : www.reddit.com/user/PotentialRelation7/comments/cci9tr/claudette_morel/
---
Right? Like as if management doesn‚Äôt decide where to allocate finances.
---
You can't win a shouting match when you're one vs four.
---
Although it's nice when a survivor starts trashing another survivor. I'll usually sit in the lobby and let them argue.
---
It doesn't look Egyptian. It clearly has some Hindu inspirations.
---
I took a few months off and got reset back to like rank 16.
---
Its shocking how many pro survivors you face in these ranks. Either swf intentionally abusing the ranking system, or people who derank/just simply dont play the game that much anymore who have over 2000 hours in the game.
---
I feel bad for new players.
---
I love how you couldn‚Äôt just appreciate the design, you had to say it makes you want to cum. You‚Äôre a special person.
---
I'm totally down with the first skin making into game but that would be a little ridiculous without a small change.  Keep the cosmetic exactly the same just make it for Freddy.  Stupid Sexy Freddy FTW.
---
Bug and bug and  bug and... Mmm yes other bug
---
You must have misread. I kill whoever destroys it. That's how I handle it. You having a problem with the way I play is the personal issue, as it really doesn't affect me   whether or not you down vote my comment. Recommend these nuts.
---
So killers do it, therefore survivors can do it, yeah that mindset doesn‚Äôt screw up the game.

People don't need to be professional game designers in order to have good opinions on balance.  Just like you don't actually have to be good at a game to be able to balance it.
---
Use enduring &amp; spirit fury. And brutal strength. And bbq is fine
---
Face camping is bad, because it's ineffective, I agree that some of the hinge should be made to prevent senseless face camping.
---
However not all forms of camping are bad. If I hook someone, and know that someone else is right there, I'm not leaving.
---
Another example is a game I had recently where you they did 4 gens, and the last 3 th y left were right next to each other. Then I hooked someone in the area, in a way that I could see them and 2 gens, with the third if I took a quick glance to the left. In situations like this camping is the only smart thing to do. I can't go away to find survivors, since their either going to save or work on gens, and all those things are right in front of me.
---
Point is. Face camping should be punished, but nothing should be. Added to make any forms of camping impossible.
---
If you disagree, tell me what the right play would have been in both situations.
---
This isn‚Äôt at red ranks. And there‚Äôs no justification for intentionally deranking. Just play the game and quit being a baby.
---

i don't know if 6 more feet would help, im thinking like going to 40 feet? (or 12 meters)
---
If EA owned DBD then you would have to buy the survivor game and pay for killer. Or buy the killer game and pay for survivors. You wouldn‚Äôt get both.
---
That's genuinely interesting. It might be a bit too strong, but nothing that some tweaks wouldn't fix.
---
By early dbd your referring to like the pre alpha dev build? 
---
I don't think we would because those would still be the weakest killers.
---
Yeah they are getting rewarded for being nice by not ranking up even more or straight depipping if superlucky. Why do you think a lot of people in rank 20-10 give hatch 9/10 games? To avoid ranking up or doublepipping...
---
That aside some people just wanna have a good time and dont give a fuck about hatch... its like when there was no EGC. I either jumped in hatch or took a swing at the survivor, pretty much guaranteed ‚Äúloss‚Äù on my side, but standoffs were never worth it.
---
really typical answer
---
Eh, that could work.
---
‚ÄúPatrolling gens, you?‚Äù- Sassface
---
I *HATE* this because when I'm playing survivor, since I play solo I run kindred. It's so fucking frustrating watching 3 teammates not too far away working on gens, despite the fact that they can see that the killer isn't camping and no survivor has gone for the rescue.
---
Wtf is going on
---
You mean the devs dont want people creating OP perks that destroy balance? Odd...
---
Remember the classic saying, there‚Äôs a game in this bug.
---
You‚Äôre a saint
---
No, full release.
---
More like admiring my hatch
---
Get a job.  Get a life.
---
I always expect Spirit‚Äôs to be longer because it‚Äôs a flippin sword
---
its a shame too, my favorite killer but i'll never play him since i don't want to be humiliated and physiologically pummeled by the survivors, so i play clown, when i get the chance to get on.
---
They have better things to do (like actually fix the issue) than give you ONE offering. It sucks that it happened to you, but do you really expect them to take the time to give you one offering?
---
That upset about losing a useless offering in a video game?
---
Feelsreallybadman. Hopefully there won't be so many DCs with dedicated servers.
---
Really honest answer you mean.
---
I actually had a glitch where there was no terror radius and all auras vanished. I didn‚Äôt know if it was a perk or something at first but when a trapper lanked me off a gen without me hearing it I knew it was a glitch.
---
So..you just go to insult me because I have a different opion then you? I have in fact played him, and seen over 15 hours of stramers play him. And guess what. He can in fact counter loops. He has amazaing map pressure and mobiliy. 
---
How about you acaullty try to counter argue your point isntead of insulting me, bedcause it makes you look patheic.
---
I only play doc at rank reset, him, trapper, leatherface, wraith, and most other killers need buffs right now
---
larger maps would help survivors out more than harm them since killers have to deal with 4 people. If each survivor is at a corner of a map they have way more control over it when it is large than when it is small, so that would not be a nerf.
---
Looping is a skill while it may not be too interesting in certain areas, but I would like to see varied tiles so you never really know what the optimal path is for looping, also fixing some maps that have loops that can be run for minutes at a time.  
---
Communication would completely screw over the balance if there weren't some gigantic nerfs to survivors and many objectives, being able to say hey the killer is at this side of the map, do generators would lead to games currently being sub 5 min even at lower ranks. Also, there is a communication for I just cleansed a hex, it is the thunderclap when it gets destroyed.
---
Placing hexs could be cool.  
---
Idk how you would nerf camping considering against some teams camping is almost required if you want to keep up the pressure. Take this example, 1 person on the hook and you see 3 people coming to save them, there is no reason to leave since you know where everyone is and you know where they all want to go, if you left to not camp you would just be letting them get a free unhook. So camping really isn't a problem except for the people who are being camped in which I guess they are just unlucky. Just as usual in this game, if a killer wants someone dead, they usually can kill them one way or another. 
---
The nurse is only imbalanced with more than 2 blinks and certain range combos, otherwise, she is the competitively viable killer the game needs and if her base power was nerfed in any way there would probably be many high ranking killers leaving the game because they legit can not win anymore. Probably many people leaving the game just because they would lose faith in the team balancing the game. So no touchy to nurse base power she already has enough downsides and is really the only killer that can compete at the highest levels of play.
---
Noed, Rancor, Adrenile are all really powerful perks, well maybe not rancor, it is powerful but not meta. They all are interesting things to play around and can be frustrating to deal with if you aren't ready for them. Not sure if they need changes, but they definitely are not OP.  
---
BHVR needs to make money so probably no store changes, certain cosmetics could be wished for enough  
---
2v8 would always be a welcomed game mode.  
---
There is my input on those suggestions.
---
Show the add on screen coward!
---
Really eh, that's sweet. Will look into it. Thought maybe I seen something similar with Radeon Relive but haven't gone back in to see what that was yet
---
Why is that ? Aren't the perks supposed to be random on it ?
---
On the flip side bro maybe my group and I are just trying to have fun too as survivors but the first person down gets face camped. Is it fun for the person who is gureanteed a derank all because he was the first to get found?
---
He gets to sit on hook all game and play spacebar simulator, and his teammates won't even have fun because no killer = no pips = no fun. 
---
Obviously if you have decent teammates they can finish gems and win in that time and maybe even attempt to save you, but if "playing how you want and have fun" means being a douchey killer who completely ruins 1 persons experiance and usually more than just him, then I have to disagree man
---
nah the avg answer you get on this forum from people who obviously have nothing smart to say
---
If the person you were replying to was using logic to begin with, they wouldn‚Äôt have listed legion as being bad.
---
No, you‚Äôre proving that you rely on your skill to earn your points. üôÇ

Wraith is better at Gen pressure how? Freddy can move faster then Wraith can with the teleport in the same time. 
---
Can you run around Hag Traps? Trapper traps? You can't just always avoiud traps like your saying. 
---
And you can't honestly remmber every pallet spot in the game espcally if you havent used it yurself.
---
&gt;Or it screams that they need to make better perks?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;while all the new survivor perks have been basically memes or weaker versions of old perks
---
Survivors got Mettle of Man, but there's a damn good reason it got nerfed. Survivors aren't supposed to be that strong. The same should go for perks that are continuously used repeatedly by people, if not whole teams. That means those perks are way too strong. 
---
I can't tell you what build I use on killer, because Freddy's getting reworked. Don't even try to put your argument on to me, besides.
---
well 9 meters is 29 feet, so with me double checking my math and being in America, i found that 12 meters is really 36 feet, so eh i guess 12 meters works, though it a bit hard to see it as a killer, i would say at least change his add on that lets him see his shock range to be more visible.
---
Your post gave me the impression that your big issue was balance while people being toxic was like a secondary thing. Sorry about that.
---
Yes people in this community can be terrible people, but you're going to find that with any online community which is why pretty much every game has a mute/block function. In DBD you can hide the text chat and never see anything from other players again.
---
You're going overboard about tbagging though. Like yea its toxic and it would be nice if people didn't do it, but you're reporting people for it? All your doing is clogging up their reports because no one will ever be banned for that. I don't mean to be rude here, but you need thicker skin if you're going to get that upset about people tbagging.
---
I mean, he just goes to insult us and refuses to listen to reason so yea it is.
---
Haha he‚Äôs my favourite to play against! Scratched mirror has me on edge all game
---
Downvoted for telling the truth. Can tel this is a survivor heavy community.
---
Swf abusing OoO is the most broken thing about this game. I mean i know people are going to use voice chat with friends but throwing OoO into the mix really is using a third party program to gain an advantage. Its ridiculous they havent fixed it yet but then im not surprised considering toxicity is what makes BhVR money and they thrive off it
---
Why arent the scooby gang atleast costumes. I would love to see a meg dressed as shaggy zoom across the map.
---
Or have some sort of entity block over it/doesn‚Äôt spawn in until - 1 minute
---
They can be, but let‚Äôs be honest, would you like to play against a level 20 killer that has ruin, nurses, pop goes the weasel and monitor.  
---
They also release perks that are going to be changed within the newly released update on the sanctuary before it goes live.
---
i thought trapper and wraith were in a good place right now? not a great place but not a terrible place ether
---
I also forgot totems we‚Äôre a thing so maybe trade that for gens to counter NOED?
---
No. Spirit fury/enduring, but not brutal.
---
I didn't know this existed until I went against a pair doing this today. Game went really freaking long but I got my 4k.
