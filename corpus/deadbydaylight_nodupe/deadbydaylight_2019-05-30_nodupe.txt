Yeah luckily i derank a lot bc i get queued with red rank killers. Otherwise id be back at rank 3 like before the reset. It seems the better you are (according to rank) the harder it is to actually find a good game
---
---
---
Removed as someone already had a post explaining this
---
Great concept! Although I think it's far more likely that we'll get Candyman instead of a Beekeeper of their own creation.
---
sometimes killers do this trick so survivors will panic and jump out (good thing you didn't fall for it haha) but i'm more concern to the fact that you didn't have iron will, how couldn't she hear you?
---
My money is saved atleast.
---
I doubt it’s time based. The associated licenser probably sold the rights at a one time price with a percent margin from sales for purchases. They wouldn’t sell it to us just for it to be taken away before the games untimely death. Haha.
---
Yeah, we get it, but after seeing the reveal we got all giddy thinking that if we didn't get Sidney and the Prescott house we'd get Fatso and knock off Home Depot. I'm excited for Ghostface and the hype spiked when I saw a potential survivor and new map.
---
I promise you the only thing of significance in that trailer was the killer himself.  The cashier and store were just part of the scene.
---
I was a little disappointed too but honestly we should be glad we're getting Ghostface at all. 
---

---
Besides they said they have other things in store for the anniversary, so can this subreddit chill with posts like these until everything is announced?
---
I love how dapper Myers looks. Like walking into a southern house and he is just staring at you silently in a sitting position, this is when you realize you made the biggest mistake of your now short life.
---
Woah
---
walter
---
u are wrong, trapper is forced to kill by the entity, he doesnt like it, even though he killed men in a mine,  
---
spirit wanted only to kill her father for what he did to his mother
---
When the survivors find ruin first insted of huanted grounds for the third time in a row and your contemplating wether you just dc or accept the gen rush
---
Because if they perfectly followed the survivor without any mistakes for five minutes, the loop would eventually break. Who cares whether that would mean the whole match would be over at that point, the killer should just wander off and let the survivor go back to working on gens.
---
I seriously do hate that this is the devs' actual stance on stuff like this. Broken loops are okay because they're not literally infinite, and they think it's fine to let a survivor abuse them because not every single survivor ever knows about them. I keep seeing them tell people to let survivors go at these loops, completely ignoring that that just means the survivor will run directly back to the loop whenever they are in danger.
---
About huntress you right, wraith and hag were forced?  Wraith killed by his own will, and noone made hag to eat people
---
To be fair he could of died and was taken. Bill died and was taken I think? And Detective tapp died and was taken.
---
Get To Da Choppa
---
Scary Movie has nothing to do with the legacy of Scream. It's nothing more than a parody. I'm not saying Scary Movie is bad or I hate Scary Movie, I just hate that Scream gets overshadowed by it.
---
Actually insane animation. Good job Behavior!
---
Now that I've seriously tried to think about it, I can't think of other ones that aren't much more borderline like Normon Bates or the Candyman.  Maybe a Xenomorph or Predator.
---
----------
---
They specifically said they were trying to come up with ideas to support it in case they ever got the rights to do Chucky; so if the license-holder actually offered that one is technically possible.
---
Their response on Jason was "we wouldn't turn it down" but it's highly unlikely they would ever get the option for that one given recent events.
---
I don't think they've specifically stated anything on Pinhead, but I doubt they'd turn it down lol.
---
-----------------
---
The only killer they have specifically stated they will never ever do is the killer from Jeepers Creepers due to who the license holder is.
---
They never said it was a scream chapter though? It was always just Ghostface.
---
And obviously this isn't all that's going to come for the anniversary.
---
This subreddit is dramatic sometimes.
---
He's super cute, and it'd be really nice to actually have someone I'd like to hug in the game for once. Instead, we just get a litany of hardbois and Ace.
---
Amazing.
---
Sometimes the lockers glitch and you can see Survivors through them as well
---
There's meme potential in this Pic
---
As an individual claiming to hate angrypug, you seem to know an *awful* lot about what he does in his stream...
---
Because we are supposed to get more chapters every quarter. 
---
Maps are probably the most important frequent addition because players are always affected by new maps in circulation.
---
New maps are the lifeblood of the game that keeps things feeling fresh for everyone, even if they have a killer or survivor they're happy with.
---
Just a plural version of gg lol. Kinda just saying it to everyone at once.
---
DS was changed. Now you can use it 60 seconds after being unhooked and stuns the Killer for 5 secs. Legion got reworked. Meta perks for Survivor are Mettle of Man / Adrenaline / Decisive Strike / Exhaustion Perk (usually Dead Hard or Balanced Landing). Killer meta is same as usual for the most part. Meta perks depend on Killer but the most popular build for a lot of Killers is Ruin/BBQ/Enduring/Spirit Fury.
---
GG means good game. Basically the match was a good one.
---
If you hit both skillchecks, it's 25%.
---
I love how it was teased/trolled that may have gotten more than just Ghostface and for us to wait for more info.  I figured as much it jus be Ghostface.  Tho,I WISH we had a Supermarket or Town map
---
*gets facecamped*
---
Ah, okay. Thanks a lot for the answer.
---
We are just getting Ghostface sadly
---
Oh no deep wunds, ill guess I'll just loop you like all M1 killers now then.
---
thats interesting...
---
ez game
---
packet loss and ms are two different things
---
The no survivor, as much as I love Sidney Prescott, doesn't really bother me. But no map? No Woodsboro?
---
Dude. Fuck Sydney, if we’re going Scary movie I’d root for Brenda. MVP for life.
---
You don't have to play a character to level them up. You can play on someone else and the use their BPs to buy things on another character's web.
---
You know a level 20 claudette probably took it with them at the other exit gate when leaving.
---
i think thats just the trailer's model, happened with the shape and his trailer, his mask looked more similar to the movie on the trailer, but in live version, looks like a raper.
---
when you’re taking a shit and the water splashes on your ass
---
I want to believe they might still get a license for her in the future and maybe add a scream cloak to the store for ghostface with her :,(
---
The NOED gamer accusing someone of being no skill.  Ironical...
---
then everyone dcs beacause the facecamper downs them
---
I don't care if it's a joke you don't put pig at bottom ever
---
Pallets too strong devs pls nerf
---
[removed]
---
Good bois?
---
Ok I won't doge. Then I get a Dc When I get my first down or hook. Sorry if I see a name of a person who I know will dc and they join the lobby I will doge. At higher ranks I see the same people or swf squads all the time. If you are playing solo and killer drops at high ranks it prob they see a person who Confirms Dc. It sucks but I'm not going to burn add ons on a team if I know a guy will Dc me. Sorry dcing is the real problem but I will admit it sucks for you to be punished ifI have to doge you because IHartToXxic420 keeps jumping in to my lobby. You lose nothing but time I lose my add ons if a dc cascade starts. Roll with the punches I guess.
---
Leatherface was a Paragraph.
---
Confirmed yeah?
---
Ah well, having Ghostface is a start.
---
She will always be top in our hearts... And in our fantasies with a strap
---
Tbh Laurie looked very similar to Jamie Lee in her DBD trailer and she looks less similar with her in game model.
---
I'd pick bbq easily.
---
That's all I've seen all over the place
---
Honestly the newer maps have had really odd/poor design choices, it definitely doesn't "feel" like a chapter but I'm kinda glad to not have another map in rotation that will make people want to impale themselves instead of playing on.
---
Haven’t we talked before?
---
Obv bbq, so your bp income is increased
---
Gotta get that BP multiplier
---
my reaction when someone cleanses against The Plague
---
Guys should I tell him I play Nurse? Or let him continue thinking I'm a survivor main?
---
Yep
---
Nothing is confirmed yet. I may be a chapter. Only reason they are calling it “ghostface reveal” is because it’s blantantly obvious that we know ghostface is coming. As for survivor and map, we will find it soon enough. They didn’t confirm it as a paragraph yet.
---
&gt;we get Ash by himself
---
&gt;we get Ghostface by himself
---
&gt;logically the next step is getting a new map by itself
---
&gt;survivors like this being greedy and asking for yet another survivor for more perks they can use
---
You can get the perks without spending money by waiting for them to come up on the shrine. If you want the survivor purely for the skin, that's fine. Just make sure they're a licensed character, as you can buy survivors for free if they're not.
---
those resources have been devoted to the battle pass :)
---
Ye
---
The next chapter should release on June 11 or 18 following the same pattern as before.
---
So if Ghostface comes out then instead, then they are considering him to be the "chapter" for June and we won't have a full chapter until September.
---
Some of the loops that are still in the game take about 5 minutes to break if you follow the survivor and don't make any mistakes or fall for mindgames. So no, you're not necessarily bad.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes but it's a hassle as it involves inputting your psn password and changing a setting that I will have to input my password to revert literally just for this one game. And it's only the killer side, i do want to be able to get messages from people when i play survivor.
---
I just love the Rope's product label. It's fun
---
PS4/Xbox One versions already cost around 30 and is digital only, while Switch will get some retail release, I think. And those only include 6 killers and 7 survivors. Pretty sure that Switch version might be priced much higher. I'm expecting something between 40-50.
---
Some people are so damn entitled. The biggest part of any chapter is the Killer, the map and survivor are secondary. The Killer always has the biggest impact on the game. We are getting Ghostface, GHOSTFACE yet people are still disappointed. I get it, it would have been great to have it as a full chapter but BHVR only got the rights for the mask. Be grateful for what we have and stop mourning what we were never even going to get. Bring on the disagreements but it’s true.
---
Considering how much they charge for it and keep charging for new characters, I expect more
---
You had mostly already lost those pips when you let them do 3 gens before getting first hook, it has little to do with what you did after that. But you would have been wise to only down and hook two at a time or even just one in the basement so you could farm them instead of having them all die on firsthook. That's 2 hooks/surv you missed out on, in addition to all the extra hit and chase points.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Read the emblems and find out what the game expects you to do, and try to follow that. The emblems heavily encourage slowing gens for as long as possible, going on chases and winning them, getting a LOT of hooks (12 total is max, I believe), and getting sacrifices/kills, among others.

I played exactly 40 games last weekend on PS4 . I counted 24 first down or hook dc and another 8 random dc. That's insane. PS4 survivors are boo boo face pussys. Sorry guys but it is true. People will dc just to stop u from getting BBQ stacks. I'm a killer main this month and I can confirm all the rage about the dc epidemic is real. I used to think killers were just salty but after losing so many add ons just because we have so many little dipshits is frustrating.
---
I said it sounds like you are. I never said you actually are. No one cares what you are.
---
Don't forget to run overcharge. Screams and explosions everywhere
---
No, it's very rare.
---
I the Clown cosmetic but,not enough to buy it, loved his,previous ones tho
---
I'm sad we're not getting Sydney...having said that, please stop moaning about everything.
---
That's not how it happened little guy.. yall little moderators wanna attack me so I told yall moderators to suck a dick...
---
All I asked was if he was gonna play killer and not afk gens all stream, because ya know its boring.. 
---
Then the mods wanna freak out and be baby back bitches, so yeah.. 
---
He said that was to much sass.. imagine being banned for defending yourself.. omegalul
---
Ah the traditional "I didn't say you were a bitch I said you were being a bitch" argument
---
killers when a survivor exists
---
My god I just noticed that now, that’s pretty dark.
---
If the shoe fits. Stop being a bitch. You’re literally crying about a game mechanic right now and hoping people will side with you. It’s pathetic.
---
Does it actually block them. Like if you report for dc will they never be allowed to join your lobby again?
---
For real
---
meg nO
---
Yeah but bbq is good to get more bp and lf is the one with bbq.
---
I've come to bargain
---
Probably just survive with friends. If not, internet connection issues are possible but I really doubt it

---
Reboot Jason would be so cool
---
MAKE THIS SKIN
---
That's completely made up. The "goal" (as far as ranking up goes) has almost nothing to do with sacrifices/kills. This is not a competitive versus game, you can't just kill everyone and barely play the game. This is a co-op game. The survivors and killers have to work together to create a (hopefully) intense and interesting slasher experience for on-another. Killers that don't understand that camp their way into low ranks, and survivors that don't understand that genrush into low ranks.
---
You're not supposed to just "muh objective." Your only objective is emblem points, period. Don't like it? See if the devs will take all the time needed overhaul their co-op game into a competitive one when there is almost no demand for it. As the devs would say, "Go play Civ V."
---
Use scratched mirror, M&amp;A, and pop out from around corners. You won't win, but it'll be a blast seeing survivors poop themselves when you suddenly show up out of nowhere.
---
\&gt;saw this
---
saw dlc confirmed
---
i only had the digital version on my mind, i forgot that Nintendo sells the cartridges  for 15/30 to the developer.
---
This is why you won't find many indie games in physical unless its some kind of special release 
---
I think the switch might come with most of the killers/survivors unlocked, except the Licensed killers / Survivors 
---
so yeah i can see how it might be around 40/50 or even a full 59.99 game 
---
i just need to keep in mind to look for a sale in store for sdcards as amazon/ebay are swamped with "fake" cards
---
I wanna say in certain maps setting the resolution to 0 will help you see survivors in the distance better?? I know it used to be a thing.
---
&gt;keep charging for new characters
---
Characters are free with in-game currency. Unless they're licensed, in which case part of the money is obviously going to the license.
---
New Hiding Place , Shopping Trolley
---
Ah, good ol' Xbox messages. I blocked incoming Xbox messages from randoms months ago strictly because of this game, but damn do some of these still make me laugh.
---
Got queued with a R2 guy yesterday, while i'm sitting at R11. Got lucky that the rest of the team were potatoes, but he ran me ragged every time I tried to do anything to him. Only got him at the end when I decided to let him win, and just tried practicing loops against him. Not sure if I learned anything, but at least it wasn't over in 20 seconds like most chases.
---
There is nothing intense or interesting about 4 friends genrushing and teabagging the fifth supposed "co-op" player on sight, and so your argument is ridiculous.
---
Plus, reworked maps and new Freddy. After Ghost Face, the two horror icons this game needs and doesn’t have to go through legal limbo to get is Pinhead and Candyman.
---
Casey Becker makes more sense lore-wise as well
---
spirit is underage and dead why the *F U C K* is she at top
---
I can agree with pig tho
---
His name was Steve D:
---
I gave a map I found in the basement chest to a pig after she hit me and stared at it only to let me go.
---
Gave her a flashlight the second time she came after me but she shook her head and killed me anyway.
---
Ms. Piggy only gives mercy once.
---
"Git Gud"  "good game" tomatoe Potatoe
---
she literally looks like SCP-096
---
Right?!
---
You have a loicence to agree with that m8?
---
Its not like they don't know that he is there, they see the killer and the killer sees them and they do this half ass cat and mouse back in forth around the hook for no reason wasting time and doing exactly what the killer wants them to do....gets a hooks and now at least 1 other survivor is standing there like some idiot wasting time and not getting gens done.
---
I mean, I say this from a killer perspective, and this is how I play. I'm not saying the killer is necessarily wrong, but they could have had two people injured(possibly another hook) rather than chasing an injured who has to heal. 
---
I get that it's probably two gens left, and the killer is just trying to get a sac, but it may have worked out better for them.
---
Damn, that’s high quality.
---
Btw, how do you post gifs here? I can’t figure it out, and I have some Ash gif’s I wanna post. :)
---
Thats not even the official scream 3 thing.
---
Oh D A R N!
---
I'm not sure how this is gatekeeping. I'm just saying as a killer it's kind of a silly move when you could have TWO injured(and possibly another hooked) rather than downing someone that was unhooked in front of you. 
---
I pretty much only play killer when I play this game, and I always go for the unhooker, unless the unhooked simply isn't running or something.
---
Agreed!  As much as I love Laurie, I hate that she’s supposedly in the entities realm but not really.  I was so happy Amanda got to come to life through Dead by Daylight, I’d like to see Casey have a second chance as well.
---
Hey there! Marilou, DG's community manager here. I'm late to the party, but I wanted to reply!  
---
So yes, crossover masks are here to stay, even after the revamp, for people who own both DbD and DG on Steam!
---
I wish he could use that as an emote in game, cause I’d stare at the camera and wave whenever someone got sacrificed
---
I have no idea where you got your information from but clearly you haven’t read the thread. I simply stated that if you’re going to acknowledge that looping isn’t toxic then you also have to acknowledge that killers using their tools provide isn’t toxic. You started arguing from there. And then you said requested other redditors to take your side by saying “hey guys should I tell him this.”
---
That's exactly what I'm trying to tell them, lol. It's not that hard to go for the unhooker, and usually nets better results because you're wasting two people's time, rather than just one. 
---
Everyone feels better, and everyone gets more points-- and you are doing better for yourself than tunneling.
---
I don't like that Ghostface doesn't really look like Ghostface outside of the actual "Scream" mask.  The hood and cloak, the coloring of it, it doesn't look right.  
---
No Sidney is a big loss too.  I'd rather wait for something to be pulled off right, than be given a half-hearted attempt.
---
your under 18 and into necrophilia
---
ok
---
Is there a chance the map could be the grocery store and that the survivor could be the dude with the killer back scratcher?
---
Brenda or Riot.
---
Hurrah more NOED!
---
Im just wondering how the Spirit didn't hear you, considering you don't have Iron Will wtf
---
have you WATCHED jojo?!
---
Scream, as a franchise, is not as widespread known as Halloween. The Ghostface mask is recognizable to just about everyone, even people that haven't seen the movie, because of how saturated that mask was as a Halloween costume, but more people have seen the Halloween movie. Jamie Lee is FAR more of a household name than Neve Campbell, and Halloween is for more popular a franchise than Scream.
---
Ash is debatable, but I still think Evil Dead holds a bit more popularity sway than Scream. Bruce Campbell is still a far more recognized name and face than Neve Campbell.
---
Yeah and just to clarify only survivors can see it.  It’s invisible to killers.
---
I bought rope when i found out there's no Sidney coming with ghostface.
---
Oh I get it... Suicide
---
he didn't disconnect! he even talked to me about how long it took for the mach to end!
---
it&gt;Chucky
---
Asymmetrical
---
You really think you are entitled to have a perk that can be strong or stronger than a killer perk when it's a 4v1?
---
I'll let you think about it for a second
---
(Without even talking about the Adam's teachable that are very strong for altruistic builds or Kate's dance with me which is very strong on stealth builds since you even mention bamboozle which is hilarious)
---
I'm not kidding, whenever there's a Hag I hold my crouch button for most of the game. I just care for my health more.
---
I think it’s just hard to tell because we still don’t know a lot about them. Obviously there’s gonna be release hype and all that, but you can’t be so definitive of the character when you still don’t know much about their perks, addons, playstyle and such. Being a killer main means nothing because you have no point of reference for the character outside of the small spoilers about one perk and an idea of how the mechanic works. 
---
Plus game improvement is still ongoing. Like we are still in the pipeline for more improvements, releasing a character doesn’t halt that. It’s not like 100% of resources are funneled into one specific thing, different people do different things as different speeds. The team who is in charge of game optimization has a bigger workload with less people than the people who design a character because the coding and designing of that code isn’t something that should be handled by more people, that just exacerbates the issue. 
---
Also it’s one thing to not like ghostface, sure. But you really stretched that first post just to say you think the company is wasting money.
---
Guys quit acting like bhvr listens to us
---
Correction: Leaving mid-game for literally no reason at all.
---
Ther is no survivor with ghostface?
---
There's more killers already???
---
Weird bug tbh, never happened to me so i can't say what was going on..  i think this was a one time bug so lets believe it will not happen again!
---
With builds, is he like most of the other killers and benefits from the usual skills? Or does he require certain specific skills in order to be good?
---
You misspelled Shorty
---
LOL That’s not even a good build. Survivors are such crybabies.
---
He probably didn’t have that information, and was guessing that with Ashe being just a paragraph that ghost face would’ve been part of a chapter
---
yeah I'm not arguing that he isn't a sociopath. I'm just saying that him being a sociopath doesn't exclude him from also having autism, which he does have traits for as well which aren't necessarily linked to sociopathy. But in the end everyone is different and the spectrum can only really be used as a guide rather than full on diagnosis
---
Bugs most definitely included....lmao
---
Nah. PC.
---
The problem is the trap disarm notification, if he puts it directly under the gate.
---
Why would you jump out the locker? Your not any better than that confused bubba
---
I never said I disagreed with OP. I agree entirely. And whatever you say champ. End of the day, when a survivor OR killer uses a tool given to them by the developers, and uses it for the intended purpose whether it be to kill someone or escape, it’s not toxic. It’s doing their objective. Tunneling is better known as efficient killing. Camping is better known as being a noob. Looping is better known as evading. Using NOED or MOM is better known as winning.
---
I’m sorry, but this couldn’t be more incorrect.
---
Thank you so much! Cloaking between hits seems quite hard though.
---
I hope he does because he was too, robbed.
---
I mean not really a spoiler if it’s an official trailer right
---
Can you make one of the money throwing? Haha
---
Great now I’m disappointed again. Thanks for reminding me of that
---
I’m gonna test if this works. I’m so curious now.
---
👉😎👉
---
We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw. Does that sound *fine* to you?
---
Is it expected to mute the trap disarm or the gate opening noise? Because the real problem is that you have to make noise opening a trap to begin opening the gate.
---
Candyman as well can't let a brotha down man.
---
I’m surprised change.org still exists. Has it ever helped anyone?
---
The Rope. Killer we don't know about?
---
I can see the trap -.- but I have to alert him before I can even start opening either gate?
---
I'd be fine with something like that for ghostie.   
---
Maybe mix bits of Badham with Lerys - hint of Haddonfield ; Boom. Scream map.
---
It’s not broken, he just did his job by killing the 3 others and happens that his power is more useful than others in the EGC.
---
I main killer as well. I never camp a hook. As far as tunneling. Depending on who I'm playing i might need the edge of taking someone out. In general i know what it's like to be survivor and I'll purposely go after people i can hook over people i can kill. I think if you ensure they can all get the most out of their game they're less likely to complain
---
Wait so ghostface is a standalone with no map?
---
Thats always been a mechanic. And trapping the exit gates is nothing new. Hag does it, trappers does it. Billy just zooms between both of them. You wanna get out? Disarm the trap
---
Ghost face Killllaaaahahhhaaa
---
The point of doing that is to catch up to them after they get a speed boost from you hitting them.
---
If you hit them as they drop a pallet/vault a window that's even better for cloaking, as you have to kick the pallet/go around the window to catch up to them. 
---
You need to judge a situation before you cloak of course, if they are still pretty close to you after the hit then yeah no point in cloaking. If there is a noticable distance though it's usually better to cloak in to close the distance. Think of it as using a very slow version of Billy's chainsaw x)
---
While their goal is "get gens and escape" gen rushing and fleeing to exit will deny them major BPs and possibly pips.
---
Just comes down to rng at that point I was last alive and the trapper trapped both exits but the gates were so far apart that I could disarm it and open it in time
---
updoot
---
Apply directly to the forehead
---
If you only use shards for characters, one a week is reasonable. Maybe 10 days, just depending on how much you play.
---
If he gets added i will drop kate and main him, i never felt so compelled to protecc a grown man before. I hope that isnt what all i feel...
---
&gt;Quit acting like they listen to us
---
David bodypillow.
---
Sure, there goes Deliverance, and she'll slug the Decisive, but Unreakable will still never work, no gens done so never get to Adrenaline, Dead Hard into a tree...no matter what, just gotta smile and remember the bloodpoints.
---
Can she teach The Spirit on how to glue herself back together?
---
Reminds me of a time there was a meg in my lobby with the deathgarden mask and their name was "Bootleg legion".
---
I couldn't have said it better myself and though I mainly play survivor I also have played killer quite abit. It's a fact both sides take this game far to seriously, as far as unhooks go I don't know why killers get all the hate for downing a survivor fresh off the hook when their teammates made the dumb move of unhooking them right in front of the killer.
---
And yet no one complained when there was no killer for the ash update
---
So why is MoM getting a rework/nerf but NOED isn't getting touched?
---
Cost the company. Cost. Not Revenue. If you’re going to try an argue at least give the illusion you’re reading.
---
Better idea: spend more or less 30,000 BP to reach an item that'll get smacked out of your hands by Franklin's.
---
As an Adam main, I appreciate this.
---
The trap never activates. So I’m thinking crouch over the trap so it doesn’t activate. Without releasing the crouch button, open the gate. As soon as the gate animation is completed you’ll still be crouching and the trap is still open.
---
Or whenever two p3 neas pop in
---
Yeah isn’t it more of a hello?
---
Because the developers have a soft spot for killers? I don’t know. But you just proved my original point that clearly NOED isn’t overpowered.
---
Zoop
---
Idc for another survivor but a new map would have been nice. I'm getting bored of the same maps over and over.
---
There are 11 non licensed killers so they can definitely do it without licensed ones. 
---
Just makes you wonder which ones are included.
---
Yeah all these people are really bumming me out. Just chill out a bit and be patient. Im sure they have something up their sleeve. Thanks BHVR!
---
Yes, but the rope is a swing, hanging from the tree
---
Haha I wanna kill myself too because BHVR doesn’t give me a new map and a survivor
---
I believe in them.
---
I don’t care much about the survivors so I really just care about the map and killer.
---
at least they actually look at this sub
---
I do understand it's difficulty. But it's been over 2 years since they got the licensing for Halloween. I'm sure they thought they would add more licenced DLCs to the game, and they got Nightmare and Saw no problem.
---
Scream is one of my favorite movies, and it just sucks that they couldn't get everything out of it that they could
---
So what you're saying is that you had a 20 min queue time before it placed you with people of a relatively similar rank, but you want ANOTHER 20 minutes added to that to wait to have only people of the exact same number rank as you?
---
It has a similar issue to the old swamp mape though, the map is so giant that unless you playing some hyper speed killer a gen is going to be 50 percent done by the time you cycle back to it in a patrol, and if you see a gen pop or about to be popped on the other side the map map, well your out of luck. Unless survivors play stupid or 3 gen themselves the map is not kind to killer.
---
You spelled "best exhaustion perk" wrong.
---
Be polite.
---
It's still rope then? OP's point still stands.
---
Literally me when I shit my pants
---
After the MOM nerf I don't think any survivor perk is considered toxic anymore. Run whatever you want as long as you have fun. That build looks pretty good.
---
Will pay double for cashier man.
---
I try to get everyone to play it! All my friends, anyone who just plays games in general and they just won’t! It’s frustrating! They won’t even give it a chance! How do you guys do it?
---
What’s free weekend?
---
Im still waiting for the other Clown maps since he didn't even get a unique tile set and it seemed like they were going for the traveling circus deal.
---
HAHAHAHAAAAAAA!!!!!!! SUICIDE BECAUSE ME WANT MAP BUT NO MAP!!!!! FUCK BHVR
---
I think youre missing the point
---
If there is a streamer, a game is pretty much guaranteed to be cancerous. As a solo red rank survivor, most of my games end in "gg" and that's it. Maybe 1/10 someone gets really upset, but those are really only when I somehow end up with green rank teammates.
---
Yeah it used to bug me at first. Then i really just stop caring lol. Its just some dude hitting ctrl. Why should i care about something so simple. My goal is to at least get one while maintaining good DBD etiquette. If i can pull that off im happy. Also if you know they're going to be toxic. Just leave quickly at the end of Match. Don't let assholes take away your enjoyment.
---
Can't wait to see the face of the ghost
---
Unfortunately, no. If you wanna grind for the achievement your best bet is to run Flip Flop.
---
A portion of people actually wanted Deadite Ash but yeah, Evil Dead has always been about Ash fighting a bunch of bad guys, Scream is literally about Sidney being targeted by different killers so she'd make more sense than Ghostface
---
Not quite that simple, bud.
---
With the Weinstein scandal, and Wes Craven's death, the Scream license is in a tricky place. Hell, we were only able to get Remake Freddy. Be grateful we're getting Ghostface at all.
---
Plus Clown has still been done dirty, we all sorta expected the lack of a new theme for him would mean that his Caravan would roam through all the OG tile sets.
---
I think it was hyperbolic
---
I find using it really boring since you just walk everywhere until the killer shows up. Run Balanced Landing or Lithe, or if you're willing to learn to use it, Dead Hard since I believe that's the best exhaustion perk.
---
Scream shifted the horror genre upon it's release spawning many movies to follow in it's footsteps. To say it was never interesting back in the day is not true at all
---
Perk: Heavyweight.
---
The Entity has trouble transferring all the hope in you. When carried by the killer he suffers from 50% speed decrease. 
---
Struggling past 75% injures the killer’s shoulder and is unable to pick up another survivor for 30 seconds.
---
*2% chance of breaking the hook and freeing yourself during attempt to free yourself.
---
Evil Dead doesn't really have a specific "villain" that would make a good killer. Scream has Sidney Prescott. Still, people ought to be more grateful.
---
Why would I even get downvoted for that?  Are people here that salty and immature?  (Rhetorical question)
---
Yeah I wouldn't try that the next time you're 1v1 against a trapper...
---
They referred to the leather face dlc on their website as a paragraph back when it came out. They have used this term before but not frequently.
---
That sucks:/ I am going to have to lean the other way, but I was rooting for you! If you end up finding proof, post it here. RemindMe! 2 weeks
---
Self-care and bond for survivor. Barbecue &amp; Chili for killer
---
I was boutta say
---
Im play as a killer, literally NO ONE AS ESCAPE YET when i activate the end game at least closing the hatch Xd. Like survs got 1% to get out. Is not fun as survivor XD
---
50 was just a theoretical number and as I recall during the last broadcast thing they talked about work burn out and how everyone has what they consider healthy work schedules so they probably have a few days off and don't work as long hours as a traditional job or split them up amongst the team.
---
Honestly I just tab out and watch Youtube or browse Reddit until I get into a game. Having a second monitor really helps since tabbing out doesn't minimise the game.
---
No, I am a well adjusted productive member of society.
---
Man, I just see the apron on her and figured she worked at whole foods
---
Unless I'm mistaken, if you didn't get any points then the DC was on you, you keep your points and get your 5k Survival when killers DC now.
---
Then they can pay for their game and unlock the next character they want after three months.
---
XD too true
---
Cause it makes the animations look smoother XD
---
Do 5 generators so 2+ Survivors are alive to distract the Killer while another opens a gate
---
Find the hatch first
---
Use a key on the hatch after it's closed
---
If you failed to complete 5 generators AND to find the hatch first then you only have one choice and have to disarm the trap, it sucks but you blew the first two chances so a third shouldn't favor the Survivor at all.
---
i agree with this, there is like 1% chance to get out with the doors
---
It doesn't. But NC is still a godlike perk on Spirit! PLEASE use it!
---
It would create another counter. If he hits 2 survivors for example that would mean he only has 1 left.
---
One of the hooked people gets saved. And now ideally you have 3 survivors roaming, 1 hooked and only 1 noed hit left. Now someone with deliverance or DS could bait a hit and now the killer has no noed anymore and the survivors might have a chance at saving their teammate.
---
With current noed you cant do that. Thats one reason why everyone instantly leaves when noed pops up. The killer can one hit your team 50 times over and there is always that one insanely good totem spot which takes minutes to find so finding the totem might not always be the answer.
---
How was it on me tho? I didn't d/c? Nobody d/ced but the killer. He had 0 points on the end screen while it said I had 20k. But I got no blood points out of it. The wierd thing is tho, it showed the escape icon next to all the survivors. And yet no BP or Adept Trophy?
---
I didn't know squatting can bring about such strong emotions xD
---
If we can't get Sidney— I want Cindy from Scary Movie.
---
Idk if it's just me but I prefer playing against the killer rather than as the killer. I love playing against Michael and I'm gonna love playing against Ghostface but playing as killer just isn't my thing.
---
Are you sure you aren't confusing it with Scary Movie? Scream was created to parody cheesy teen horror movies, and ended up being a genuinely well made horror flick.
---
Oooh, is it time to share petty insults? 
---
I have to say the funniest thing I've ever been told to do was go to bed. It's just like "what, am I your child or something?"
---
Though in all seriousness, Ruin is proving to not even be enough anymore. It's too luck-based to make a difference by itself for a Trapper main like myself, so I have to run something else that's more active and foolproof with it, like Overcharge or Pop Goes the Weasel. Not even Corrupt + Ruin is good enough. Something to help with active regression is more potent than prevention for a certain period of time.
---
This game should absolutely take steps to move away from RNG when it comes to things like totems and the like, particularly if you're running more than one hex. Not to mention the auras should be different for every perk or at least different between actual Hexes and Thrill of the Hunt or Haunted Ground. That way you know which one to defend.
---
So the road map they keep showing and is on their website is bullshit?
---
the others are on their twitter as little gifs
---
[https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR)
---
Ash was called a chapter as well, but it was the same price as Leatherface. I wouldn’t worry about Ghostface being more expensive.
---
I want Chucky just so he can talk shit to survivors and give them the finger
---
I was just mentioning this to my friend. Almost 500k views and the day isn't even over. Pretty crazy!
---
Don’t you just hate it when they release more content for something you enjoy. Harrumph.
---
Totally down, actually.
---
Wow great banter, thirst for karma is real
---
Baal would’ve been pretty cool and work fairly well. He’s also big enough of an antagonist to make sense.
---
Except there is literally no counter play if it's a 1v1. So smartass, how about you and everyone else quit downvoting the guy over a legitimate complaint?
---
He's probably talking about a 1v1 scenario
---
DS is fine now and MOM's getting nerfed anyway, so...
---
Baal only made an actual physical appearance in the latter half of season 2. Making a power for him would be really difficult too.
---
Just did research, I didn't realize that you get 15 for free
---
No, it's not 1 persons fault their team was shit/camped/tunnulled
---
what if his special is you can voice chat with a random survivor for a certain time, showing their aura.
---
Indeed.
---
I hope they don't add any more talking characters. I didn't realize how quiet it was, or how much I enjoyed the quiet, until that guy started talking by the campfire.
---
Adam perks &gt; Claud’s perks, all day 
---
I like when people play him, glad they bought him, good perks and never as toxic.
---
no they are not teachables, they are repeats of tier 3 perks that I already have i.e spine chill, self care, etc.
---
prayer bead spirit is better than nurse and billy. prove me wrong
---
I understand you play SWF, but for me that kills the tension in the game. You gain huge amount of map and killer location knowledge. The game is not really balanced for SWF. That is not the way the game is designed (regardless of if it is how the majority play). That is on the Devs. 
---
Back to the point, hexes are not great, Survivors do need something else to do, and the game is not fair to solo Survivors when faced with NOED. These are all Dev issues. The resolution is not to say play SWF and use 3rd party coms to gain a advantage. That may be how you like to play, and that is fine if you find it fun. I and many others don’t.
---
I was just saying that i would simply like to imagine that lol. I was not against a nerf to DS. And MoM is going to be useless now. Who in the hell gets 3 prot hits....
---
I’ve always been here pal. A lesson I’ve learned being on this sub is in order to accomplish our goal we must be discreet. People on here hate our kind and will continue to feed us downvotes. But I assure you once the greatest horror icon in history is finally added to DBD, and he will be, the turn tables will turn and we will have our well deserved revenge.
---
A cool trick to try out, is to run distressing, stand so that a gen is just at the edge of your terror radius. Phase over and try to get a yoink. Pretty fun thing, most people seem to forget you can't hear her wooshing while in TR.
---
Follow up to that, using that to jumpscare people while chasing someone else can be a good idea. Alot of times survivors can get cocky while you are chasing someone, and if you know where they are you can phase over when they least expect it.
---
Alternatively to distressing you could run Monitor and Abuse, and simply walking to gens, to save your power. Spirit's "chase loop" is to try to get a normal hit off, and then phase after to get the fastest possible down. Monitor brings her terror radius down to 16m.
---
Spirit is a stealthy killer, abuse the unpredictability of her phasing to catch survivors off guard.
---
If you are having trouble catching people with your phasing, try standing still for a second, watching what the survivor does, and then phasing after them.
---
Spirit's phasing is generally best to use when you know where survivors are. Try not to just throw it out to get to gens if don't really know where survivors are. It's good to find a balance between phasing in and out of chase.
---
Holy. Shit.
---
Is that steam only?
---
That would never work for numerous reasons, SWF being the primary one.
---
Yeah ikr.
---
All these posts about this new record make me roll my eyes.
---
Just as I said in another post about that a couple days ago - nothing special. And wow look at that , only 13k players after it ended. 
---
But don't pay attention to me , I'm just a negative and toxic guy for saying that (stating facts apparently makes me that, lol).
---
I hope to god this is a short-lived meme
---
Still not that much of a gen rush. I agree it was busted before. But using it as argument for genrushing in the current state of the game isnt exactly valid.
---
That's totally subjective. Since it's his opinion, you should probably ask him.
---
They xouspnt for legal reasons I can't feel emotion over something they can't control
---
Right? I’d prefer the reboot Jason over any of the others. He’s the scariest imo
---
Legit thought I was on r/adventuretime
---
It takes all of 3 seconds to disarm the trap
---
Too bad Clown is a shit killer compared to Nurse / Billy.
---
for killer i have bbq as a staple. imo surveillance is underrated. 
---
for survivor - it depends on how you play. i like to be a sabotaging jake so MoM comes in handy so does dead hard. 
---
if you want to run gens ive found poised and prove thyself to be effective 
---
if i start feeling like im being tunneled game after game i might throw on decisive strike or an exhaustion perk like balanced or lithe
---
I yell at people that I SWF with if they take their offerings back. Like that's just rude and I will help the killer camp you.
---
A shark would be my main
---
You know they did the same thing with Leatherface go look on the official website. The Leatherface chapter is only him (and yes I'm aware about grim pantry coming out at the same time but it doesn't list it as part of the chapter)
---
Since he's so popular and respected as a good killer, I thought he best represented the opinions of dbd players.
---
Yes, and now he knows which gate I'm at.
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
mostly its just what he says.
---
But also, its wasted if you still take the Hit when throwing it down, or when you use up many/important pallets early in the game
---
You are aware that money doesn't magically mean they get the licenses right?
---
I Haven't really seen anyone "Complaining" about Ghost Face being a just paragraph, just people being bummed cus pretty much everyone wanted Sidney Prescott lol
---
It's because some survivors decide to put their own immediate self preservation over later parts of the game. An example springs to mind with throwing down the shack pallet with 5 gens left to go, which can make or break an escape attempt from the basement.
---
A wasted pallet can make a section of the map unsafe. The term tends to be thrown around more when a survivor refuses to loop, and just runs from pallet to pallet
---
And then camps.
---
&gt; I understand if Haddonfield, Springwood, and Gideon realms can not get more maps due to being standalone licensed locales. 
---
And thank god for that.
---
I think the mask is actually *named* "Ghostface", because I read somewhere the designer of the mask named the character, so yeah as long as they have the rights to the mask it's all good.
---
Yeah, I can see where you're getting at. Put more money towards a map reaction of the street in the film (Complete with a disembowelled corpse for your lovely viewing pleasure!) and even Sydney herself! I saw a bunch of good perk suggestions on this subreddit for Sydney.  
---
Though... If I can give a reason why you may of been downvoted, it was because you said "Ghostface just isn't that interesting". I mean to many, the film series is such a landmark in their lives where it was some people's first ever horror movie. (I mean this is a low hanging fruit but) Not to mention its based on real events.  
---
I agree that you wanted more from this chapter, I think we all do. But I'm just pleased we're getting new content.

---
Iv watched survivors being chased and the killer is way beyond getting stunned and they drop it don’t even loop around it and take off to another one
---
Not like you had the 15 to begin with.
---
Hahaha all these killer mains are mad for no reason
---
That would be cool, but I see why they don't do it. It wastes time, but they want Trapping to be a mark of skill and good reads on the environment, which is why they are all manual. It's lessen the impressiveness of the character if people got trapped in a a trap the killer hadn't even seen yet but they got lucky with a spawn. (I mean IS sorta does this, but it's an ultra-rare addon so that gets a pass).
---
until it gets Nerfed get mettle of man
---
Then you go to the other gate he can't guard both at the same time. It takes him longer to place it then you to disarm
---
The only thing that makes me doubtful is the fact that they only got the rights to the ghostface mask, which makes me doubt if they got rights to Sid or Woodsboro
---
Nice trailer but I can’t help but feel disappointed about his inclusion. If his leaked ability is his actual ability then he will be pretty lame. His power doesn’t seem interesting at all. Hopefully it’s better than the leak.
---
Except your wrong. He beats them both in terms of sheer GIRTH.
---
Except he makes up for more than enough of that time by moving faster than me.
---
Honestly? Considering we got Bill from Left 4 Dead, we could only dream that we could get other survivors. Joel or Ellie from The Last of Us or Jim from 28 Days Later (NOT from The US Office, I see you jokers in the back there). We got Ash from Evil Dead. Why not on the subject of Zombies, give us TWD costumes. I've said this before in previous posts, and people have agreed that they would be interested in seeing The Walking Dead costumes. I'd throw money at it!
---
&gt; Everyone knows everything they need to know about the DLC. It has 1 killer 0 Survivors and 0 maps.
---
Right, so you know in advance that it's not going to be a full chapter, hence not the same price, hence worth the cost.
---
&gt;A killer is a huge change to the game and should come with a new map that allows the killer to utilize its abilities as best as it can.
---
Killers can utilize their abilities on all maps, A New killer does not guarantee a new map, that's just you being entitled thinking it does.
---
&gt;If they are going to spend thousands of dollars on a high quality promotional video with a setting that would be a perfect map then why not go the extra mile and create the map to go along with the killer. 
---
Because of Time, Money and licensing. They only got the licence for the mask, that's it. Anything else and they risk being sued for copyright infringement.
---
&gt;The only reasonable answer is that they are being rushed which is not how quality content is created.
---
Again, The DLC has not even released, you don't get to claim the content is not Quality until it does.
---
Legally distinct tape and dissimilar rope are my favorite brands
---
Just play the game man and leave right when the game ends so you don’t have to here idiots complaining. It’s easy
---
I'm saying the could go the who ever owns the movie rights and get them aswell. Sindey, woodsboro highschool and some classic Ghost Face cosmetics for a "Scream Chapter"
---
I know right? It's just so baffling to me.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
They did this 2 years ago with Bill and Leatherface, but I'm not sure if there was a map
---
Did they not have the rights to anything other than his mask i mean it’s a cool design but it strikes me as odd considering Myers was based off part 6 mask Freddy is female Freddy and leather face is the original 74 bubba
---
I like how you ask for a counter and they just freak out
---
yes, as far as i know. unless you are one of the people that got the game for free forever on playstation that one month
---
You do make a point. Then again, we can't say for certain what BHVR had rights to. Although do you think if they had the rights to use Ghostface, they would the rights to use Sydney as well?
---
Say it’s “horror-themed” as opposed to be an actual horror game.
---
Depends on the context. But there are some pallets that are very strong, like killer shack, where it's a waste to throw it down early in the game. Even it means you're going to get downed if you don't throw it down.
---
Also, taking a hit while throwing down a pallet is a waste. Because you could have used the sprint burst to get away, and save the pallet for later.
---
Gotta hand it to BHVR for the attention to detail they do. They really know how to make a trailer for those who are huge fans of all horror movies.
---
If it's just a killer then theres no chance it's going to cost as much as a regular DLC. IF it does then it's them being money hungry.

---
Since reboot has him as an A.I. it is possible to upload it into a bigger body.
---
BHVR lawyers and marketing have been very good on this one; what we call Ghost Face is just a Halloween costume. Not even related to the movies.
---
It is, but at least for me, if you count Friday, Halloween, Nightmare and Texas Massacre, Scream is the weakest. Also in my country when people see Ghostface, Scary Movie is what comes to mind first for most of them.
---
For context, I don't play, but my friend does, and she had at least once had to survivor rank 1 for a while. I think she plays less now but this looked awesome as an outsider looking in and figured y'all might appreciate.
---
I mean, you could have one game where all the survivors just have the unluckiest game imaginable. But as SOON as some guy doesn't do the T-bag greet. Then suddenly the other 3 have the team composition like SAS Navy SEALS. It is a right of passage. You must greet your fellow survivor with a t-bag.

This is a fact i think people keep forgetting.

How does that matter? Lol. Movie can be boring to 30 year old as well as for 12 year old. Me being 21 has absolutely nothing to do with it. I'm not attacking your favorite shit, you can cum while watching if you wish so, I'm simply saying I don't love it.
---
Because sometimes, it’s better to take the hit than to drop a safe (loopable) pallet like the one at the killer shack, the one at the cow tree, the double pallets by the basement on The Game, and so on.
---
I’m (rank 10) playing with my sister (rank 20). She is brand new and I’m trying to help her figure out how to play. I ran the killer around after this guy got hooked 2x and tried to swoop in for the last minute save. Obviously I failed and I got this message.
---
WHY IS IT NOT THE SHAPES, BECAUSE THAT BUTT IS AT LEAST 30 SHAPES WITH THAT SIZE

I want to see this as an emote while getting face camped pls
---
Because we're here for content of the game, not for people to use this as their personal venting about an individual who plays the game. Use your goddamn twitter to whine about stuff you don't like. I do not why this post hasn't been taken down, there's nothing in this post about the game AT ALL.
---
Yes all the way
---
IDK OK I'M NOT JOHN CARPENTER
---
He’s big and he plays football, and he’ll kick the shit out of you!
---
You're free to not comment on this post then.
---
Goodbye, Felicia.
---
My philosophy is "It is my Job to Kill you and I don't give a flying fuck how I do it, I'm gonna do it." If Camping is the most beneficial thing You can do at that moment (I.E. The Survivors Bum rush the hook, there are people around the hook, etc.) just stay. You aren't their to  make them happy...again, KILLER.
---
Scared some survivors last night and killed 3 of them.
---
Immediately felt bad when I realised they were ranked 20-18. No wonder it was a walk in the park.
---
Taking a guess and saying Plague since she's the newest ? I believe console players had to wait for huntress
---
I just prefer killer over the cycle of: hold down a button to fix a gen while occasionally pressing space -&gt; hide -&gt; get found -&gt; loop -&gt; go on hook -&gt; get freed -&gt; repeat until you die or escape -&gt; get like 75% less bp than if I played killer.
---
But Sydney Prescott... i need her in DBD but unfortunately we wont get her.
---
Give us Cashier guy!
---
definitely takes some of the fun out of it coming to the switch! the original killers are fantastic but I wanna play as Myers on the go!
---
Exactly. My point was that $30,000 is a lot less than you think it is. I'm sure not everybody can work on the character at once. And not all 50-ish members are working on the Spirit. But it's still not very many man-hours that add up to $30k.
---
Complains about toxic people, acts childish and toxic themselves. Love the tactics.
---
It's timeless imo. Honestly, despite what many people may think of it now, it will always be one of my favourite games of all time. Have so many great memories with it, and in its glory days it was pretty much all I played. The gameplay still holds up today, because it's solid from the ground up, even if there are some balance issues.
---
Use your ears more than anything! Survivors can juke with their scratchmarks but have no control over what sounds they make. (unless they have Iron Will, but who the actual fuck runs that?)
---
Not necessarily, the mask has seperate rights I think, so probably even him. I heard it's very complicated.
---
He's not bad, but he's add on reliant. You pretty much need to use the add on "Windstorm" every game
---
...you’re joking. The devs have spent the past months working on reworking Freddy’s power, to be revealed this Friday during the 3rd Anniversary stream.
---
Oh! I must've though something else, I meant the Senior or Jock Y'know. They usually wore some blue suits
---
Here here! It's frustrating seeing people badmouth a business who are genuinely trying to do their best to provide good entertainment while also not working their employees to sheer breakdowns (We're looking at you Epic...).Without people like Dave, Ash (Who is now working on Deathgarden) and McCote, this game would have never seen the light of day. Its awesome to find passionate people like the people working at BHVR. We as the customers need to find the right balance in expressing our issues and concerns and respecting the company's work schedule.
---
Freddy's lunge caught on camera.
---
Looks like someone's got a debt with Jotaro incoming.
---
Didn’t even have a gg ez dodge noob killer
---
Next time reply with "just don't get caught then!"
---
Either shuts them up or makes them enraged. Either way it's a win against these types of crybabies.
---
by using ruin, hooking People or blocking of 3 close gens
---
You think it would of been the same with the Left Behind Paragraph? I mean it probably wasn't just Bill, but also the costumes and clothing for the survivors to wear.
---
My big concern is they are consistently calling this a chapter. Does this mean this is the standard for chapters now? Are we paying full chapter price for 1/3rd of the content normally in a chapter?
---
what’s your favorite few builds?
---
If you believe that 2-man SWF + 2 random solo survivors can effectively "gen rush", then there is nothing to help you fight it. Not a killer, not a build.
---
Absolutely i still playing it for shits and gigs, the community servers just have some absolutely hilarious maps and game modes. 
---
The zaniness of the characters and the background lore is a good example of what and make a good game fucking great.
---
I know and I'll definitely get Ghostface but Scream is definitely my favorite horror franchise and it's disappointing that we'll only get half of it in the game, not because I don't want the half but because it kinda seems like it throws all chances of ever getting the other half
---
Additional Survivor PSA: On be half of All Killer Mains out there, *Fucking Stop*! Its not fun, you ruin the experience for everyone, and you're just kind of an asshole that can't commit to a team if you do it.
---
Thank you
---
I would drop Min to P3 him. No give him special Legacy Skins on him.
---
Intense! I love it.
---
You need pressure. Basically anything you can do to prevent a player doing a generator. So chase a player, wound em, then switch targets. Hook a guy, defend it from one person so another has to come. Basically waste their time while you whittle them down.
---
[||||||||||||||](https://i.imgur.com/WOEC4O7.gif)
---
-     A good one to start out with is:
---
*Addons:*  *Katsumori Talisman* (Considerably Increases Duration) and the *Dirty Uwabaki* (Considerably increases Speed)
---
*Perks:*
---
Barbecue and Chili
---
Stridor 
---
Hex: Ruin
---
Hex: Haunted Grounds 
---
           This will give you enough time in the game and with the duration of your power to practice your tracking and attacking with the power. ( Also, in my opinion she's harder than the Nurse, so don't be discouraged if you don't start winning instantly.)
---
-      A more advanced build when you have the Listening for survivors thing down:
---
*Addons:*  *Prayer Beads Bracelet* (Makes your power completely silent) and the *Mother-Daughter Ring* (Tremendously increases Speed but at the cost of you not seeing scratch marks)
---
Hex: Ruin 
---
Hex: Thrill of the Hunt 
---
         This build will,  A. allow you to pull survivors off of generators/totems without them knowing you are coming and B. Allow you to have INSANE map pressure. Don't do this right off the bat because beginners not being about to see scratch marks more often fucks them over in the long run.
---
Keep at it and I hoped this Helped.
---
Edit: In the Second build, You can replace BBQ with Hex: Devour Hope and play *Hex Roulette* if you wanna meme. (Its actually way more effective than it should be tbh)
---
Cotton would be a cool survivor too
---
Hex: No.
---
Somehow that’s a downvote
---
Chainsaw won't give stacks, and it will insta-down when healthy. However, if you're injured, it will work since you go from injured to dying in that case.
---
That's from some past experiences though, I've not seen Hubba Bubba roaming the fog much since then but I have seen it happen once or twice, not certain if that was changed though.
---
Depends on why the pallet was thrown down and it’s location. The shack pallet is god and it would be stupid to use it up early in the game
---
If you're playing killer and are using bbq you can have all four people escape and still walk away with potentially 50k+ bloodpoints.
---
*gets Survivors who dc on first down*
---
Entity during the EGC: muhahahahaha...
---
&gt;  I have no idea why people expect them to call it this.
---
You asked what else would they call it. I personally don't expect it to be exactly "paragraph." What I would like is for different terms for when they're releasing content that isn't their normal full release.
---
Main reason to dodge is high ping. There's no way I will play Huntress vs 200+ pings. Second reason (and yes, I'm not good at killer) is the amount of items they have. If they think 3 toolboxes is what they need to "win" in green ranks, they can find another killer. Third reason is twitch/youtube name.
---
I've been maining survivor and I agree. It's the same case with the Bill and Leatherface situation. Back then I think people were just stoked at getting Leatherface ^(^before ^he ^became ^the ^beacon ^of ^basement ^camping).
---
I'm ok with just getting a killer for now since we got Ash. 
---
I would like a new map though or an addendum/variant to the maps we have.
---
Remember when people were all about Friday the 13th ending DBD? Lol
---
Yeah lay one on me
---
If you really want the survivor go for it
---
And it's more mentally damaging since your all alone and as survivors it's a team effort.
---
No I agree with you, I upvoted you so you at least got back to zero
---
Eh.
---
Me! I'd love to play as Chunky Boi Cashier!
---
Yeah I'm strange
---
And I get removed for my salty post game chat post. Bs.
---
uuuugh. the art has nothing to do with a person. god damnit. Jeepers Creepers looks literally like the Entity. they can be god-like siblings. he can be *in* the Entity during the times he's *asleep*.  he can be a ranged killer with float-like-flying sprint or can use flying as a way of detection. holy shit he is so perfect who cares what his licence holder did/said/whatever. the world is insane.

Not too much just 7 bucks
---
Of course when I check his profile on Steam; he had *preemptively* blocked me, as if expecting salt. I'm not even mad, just amazed how someone like that can still play the game. 
---
I'm a [DEDICATED](https://i.imgur.com/RncpdDE.png) killer main ([Survivor ranks for the curious](https://i.imgur.com/UH6UAHK.png)), I have shit matches at times, sometimes I'm purely outclassed, more often its through the mistakes I make which survivors capitalize on. But to be so unaware as to how self-sabotaging your tactics are is amazing. Then to *disconnect* as if you're a toddler throwing a temper-tantrum that your square block isn't fitting in the round hole is just astonishing.
---
Another Survivor is nearby and is helping release them. Beyond that you might need better addons.
---
And look at that drop! Sick.
---
BHVR actually had stuff like emotes in the survey. I wouldn't mind some "iconic" ones like Myers head tilt or Bubba's chainsaw pelvic thrust.
---
I have 65 dollars in my steam wallet but i dont want to spend it on a character that i can get without paying, i also need to get the perks like bbq to actually play spirit well. Ill probably give up and buy  it soon though.
---
It’s school hours on a Wednesday, people at this time are either working/going to school, sorry to break it to you but people that play this game have things to do other than play DBD
---
Not really but he is very fun. Just remember to bodyblock survivors when they're trying to do gens or throw down a pallet
---
I think Chief Hopper would be a good pick.
---
But what about the killer?
---
18th of june

I just sent a tweet out asking if they would make it so when you get prestige three his face pumps blood like the Halloween costume.

Thank you!

Hi Kate! 👋
---
If the map has grass, good survivors should see it move. Also the more people that learn about the build, the less effective it becomes. Surprise is a big thing with this and if a spirit gets a couple grabs, then good survivors will adapt. ie. Gen tap, 1 person per gen or tap a gen and walk away to counter surveillance.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I know it's strong, but whats the back up plan if the survivors know what you're trying to do or they have spine chill?
---

Just because you don't know about it doesn't make it false. Scream revitalized the slasher genre and is among the highest box office results in horror.
---
For the life of me I can't remember what were the motivation for the killer(s), I only vaguely remember the motivations from the scary movie counterpart.
---
This would be cool, but I think its just common serial killer associated things.
---
Alright. But I'm keeping it real close and lit
---
LOVED getting facecamped today with that face staring at me the whole time👌🏼
---
That *could* be a reason, however that stretch was to illustrate the very same point.  *Anything* can be written to contradict what's visible and plain to see.  The fact that doesn't change whether a character is 'written' to be 1000 years old or 29.

To be downvoted so fast when the post actually contributes to the conversation tells me there's a truth in there people are desperate to avoid.

&gt;The LEFT BEHIND Paragraph also include 4 new outfits for the Survivors inspired by the Left 4 Dead series.
---
Yea hopefully! They've said they'll be talking about something like map reworks for several maps and we know very little about that so far, hopefully that's a large change, maybe adding new tile possibilities for existing maps? That could go a long way and be just if not more interesting than a single new map. 
---
And the Freddy rework is finally on the verge of release they've said they'll be revealing that as well. 
---
Maybe there's some other little surprises in store with their year 3 announcements
---
Cool comment bro

Maybe general brightness or something with gamma though? You think that could help?

Not only did you crawled through the exit on time from the killer, but also the endgame: collapse.
---
Hey, I wasn't trying to offend you. Just saying I don't think it's a reference.
---
Like, it's a really famous opening, but not for the exact ways they got killed. It was really famous because it made jokes and referenced other horror movies. It also killed off an established, famous actress who people assumed was the leading girl. Also, the tape is a different color and Drew Barrymore wasn't hung by a simple rope.
---
I don't know much about that, so I can't tell
---
Am currently saving up all my prayer beads so I can go on a spooky spirit rampage, forgive me papa ash

Uh dude scream is on that list

For survivor, Mom, exhaustion perk, adrenaline, BT/iron will/self care/DS.
---
Killer varies a ton, depends who you play
---
Uh ya i see that. It's also at the bottom of that list see the other 46 above it? That also made way more money? And are considered better movies?
---
That fast? In less than a second or so of getting trapped?
---
I don't know. Maybe? Game is designed with non optimal visibility in mind, and that's the way I play it.

If I remember correctly, Sidney's BF's dad cheated with Sidney's mom and he believes it ruined the marriage/his life. And I think Stu just did it for fun.

If you look at the amount of pip spaces, you can tell that the OP is somewhere between rank 20 and 17.
---
What would be a sentence?
---
Which perks should i get for spirit?
---
have mother daughter ring or the amulet, you move so fast and probably will notice your spine chill as soon as your yanked off. if they gen tap then your slowing the game down immensly, now if you add a ruin the game will be so slow. Personally, i never feel safe working on gens against prayer bead spirit, you can get off the gen or tap it and she still gets a hit, slowing the game down more by forcing you to heal or forcing you to run injured and making you a one shot next time she finds you. dont forget about the mind game potential she has still has even without prayer beads on.  Spirit is dominant, prayer beads make her the #1 killer hands down, her learning curve is insane but pairing it with hex totems like ruin devour toth and either lullaby or HG will destroy any 4 man swf. they work on a totem? pluck them off, rinse and repeat, theyll keep trying and they will eventually start destroying totems but its going to be to late when everyone is on second hook and if tou run HG you can slug almost the whole team in 60 seconds.
---
Theyre also trying it with predator now lmao DBD is starting a trend of these 4v1 killer games and none of them have been very good besides DBD. Theyre fun for a bit to get something fresh and then after that? Nothing
---
Well I see I have found a self portrait
---
It's true, I really do.
---
I love Lampkin and Badham...

does it?

Do you have base console or the pro version? Because that might explain it. On a sidenote, if you play on PC and console both then even the pro feels like horseshit.

---
I main killer and I always gg. Gotta kill them in the match and kill them with kindness afterwards.
---
Only certain people know this killer.
---
I don't think he's saying that, but he could be saying that they do Ghostface AND a new map, killer, and survivor. or new game mode or something that we don't know about yet, unrelated to Scream.
---
I don't care if I step on a trap that spawned by luck a lot of parts in this game is spawned by luck anyway(totem placement,generator placement, basement, map, loops, window spawn, hook escape,...).
---
In your opinion it was a bad movie. In many other peoples opinions it was a great movie, and that is why many are excited for Ghostface coming to DBD. This is what we've been talking about this whole time. Just because you don't like the movie and think it was bad doesn't mean it wasn't well received by many, and seen as a successful and popular movie.
---
Jesus these rules are so arbitrary

hmm i wonder why i can see the killers aura monkaMEGA

---
I honestly am confused by this. Great potential there with another iconic survivor like Laurie with Sidney. I’m also confused because, whether anyone admits it or not, it’s quite clearly obvious Legion was the Ghostface knockoff like Trapper is to Jason. I guess Legion was just a colossal failure with extreme backlash, so they went ahead and got the licensed Ghostface. That’s the only think I can think of.
---
That doesnt count with a free weekend lol
---
I mean supposedly he can only suppress his TR + red stain for 5 seconds after a noticeable screech noise so probably not better than Myers or Spirit.
---
Considering you're in the grey ranks.. good job, I guess?
---
Considering the game is basically dead and I swear I read they lost the rights to make more content for it, I’d actually say Jason could happen. 
---
But Trapper is already basically Jason (but Billy was basically Leatherface too so idk).
---
The risks of a slugging attempt
---
Yeah, Store Manager sucks. I thought you meant that mid-level manager; above cashiers but below Store Managers.
---
Honestly I just hope he talks. 
---
He 1M% won’t. But I’d like to dream. Ghostface always had such a great voice.
---
What if instead of Sid they get  Henry Winkler's character and then have a young principal that wears a leather jacket?
---
Lol
---
I wouldn’t mind if they delayed the chapter and even just added a new map and ghostface. Most of the maps are really similar and a hardware store like the one in the trailer would be cool.
---
You just ended racism congratulations
---
But but but the meta.
---
I'm happy.
---
If they had the movie license the killer would have lame lore, and probably not the ghost face mask we are getting.
---
It works out better that they got the license that counts
---
I'm glad it's not the stuff that is literally just a Meta horror, and not the same thing as a real horror movie. With a real monster.
---
Did the fix the bug already? I haven't heard from him for a while.
---
Most people only play survivor. New survivors tend to have game-breaking second chance perks.
---
I am mostly bummed that there's no new map but if Ghost Face adds a lot of fresh new gameplay to the game, I won't complain.
---
&gt;And the people who have the latter way of thinking clearly just don't care about the movies in the way many other people do.
---
I partly agree but I think what's those people are trying to say is that we should be grateful we're getting Ghostface which is fair. They are going about it the wrong way imo like calling us "entitled" but I think generally, people just want us to be happy we're getting the killer which is understandable.
---
You saw this shit aswell? 
---
Yep.
---
Those darn kids.
---
I hope so. Michael scares the crap out of me sometimes and I love it. Ghostface...should be even worse😂
---
It's better to not even look for the Ruin totem, faster this way. Of course keep an eye on your immediate surroundings and maybe give an extra look or two around corners but that's it.
---
If they ever change her hitboxes ill actually be very disappointed
---
Good luck pressuring the map with an average killer against very good survivors.
---
While a new central feature might be cool, *maps* like these mostly use old assets which is just boring to look at. Not much work has gone into a map like say, Haddonfield. All fresh textures. 
---
When they announce a New Map, I'm expecting a new playing ground with a unique feel and look rather than a New Map that is just 80% assets with a couple of new ones.
---
I destoryed a 4man swf in 60seconds with Pig. I let them live because I felt bad. They then toxic teabagged me and wrote me messages saying they "outsmarted" me and that I should have finished the job. They forgot that an active RBT will still kill you. ThanI got 4 hate messages on my profile saying I was a toxic killer. BEst day ever.
---
I'm not thrilled we dont have a map. I'm not worried about the survivor. It's nice to have the hole deal though with a licensed chapter but I get it. The mask and rest of the franchise are split up so it's understandable. I just hope when the stream happens they explain what all happened with acquiring rights.
---
Plague was a priestess of Babylon granted powers of disease by the entity when she was at her last moment.
---
But they call him Ghostface in the movie. I know it's the name of the costume within the movie's universe but I still would've thought it all tied in within 'Scream'.
---
That doesn't make sense at all considering that Leatherface got released exactly 1 month before a full chapter came out whereas this year Ash got released 2 months before Ghostface which **isn't** a new chapter.
---
Yeah, that's true! I agree that we should be happy (which I am, I love Ghost Face still), but it's just so hard not feel some sort of of disappointment. It's unavoidable if you're a big fan. And being rude online to the people that feel that way is a dick move haha
---
Even then claudette is more blended in.
---
“Oh, you’re approaching me?”
---
“I can’t get the shit stunned out of me without getting closer”
---
“Oh then come as close as you’d like!”
---
Agreed he looks so bad that I wouldnt mind if they delay the Freddy rework so they can give him a face rework.
---
Latern was only created last year, and there's still a lot of association with Weinstein.
---
Fun World makes masks for kids, so they don't need that funk right now.
---
Ghostface definitely is one of the 4 chapters in Year 4. There's 3 months between each chapter; so June -&gt; September -&gt; December --&gt; March -&gt; Year 5 June. They wouldn't begin Year 4 at a later date than the chapter that releases around the anniversary (like Clown).
---
But when you know the camera angles, you just have to create the backgrounds, not full 3d objects.
---

---
Lol. Old doesn't have to do anything with a game when it's still pumping out money.
---
Efficiency effects the rate of charge getting used while using. Speed effects the gen repair speed (for example) at the cost of increasing the item usage rate
---
Trueeee, leatherface wasn’t classed as a chapter, neither was ash.
---
ITS MORPHIN TIME
---
We can hope.
---
But, I didn't bash anybody?
---
I wasnt very impressed, as I play huntress a lot and those are pretty common, but then I realized that's on a controller so jesus christ that's pretty epic.
---
Spirit does not need bbq. I’m a spirit/pig main. My favorite build to run with spirit is a basement build consisting of Strong Hold, Agitation, Make Your Choice, and Hex Ruin to slow the game down just a lil bit. It’s a very strong build that completely demolishes games on certain maps. Another good build is the don’t touch my totem spirit which runs Devour Hope, Ruin, Haunted Grounds, and Thrill of the Hunt. Lastly, the build that I used to use most often consisted of Rancor (deal with pesky mettle of man and good locator perk), Ruin, Save the Best for Last (to combo with Rancor), and Make Your Choice. Make your choice is such a strong perk and ultimately should be taken over anything unless you are playing the totem build. Spirit can travel fast back to the hook and can follow scratch marks very well. You’ll definitely be able to get at least one down whether it be the exposed guy or the freshly unhooked person. When somebody is hooked, someone will eventually die when spirit has make your choice.
---
As for whether or not to buy spirit, I wouldn’t buy her for real money. Like you said, you can just buy her with in game currency. She’s a lot of fun, but if you play for a couple of weeks you’ll be able to get 9,000 shards for her. BBQ is most likely not going to come out on the shrine again for another year, just take a look at a shrine calendar and you’ll see it’s only ever been in it twice with the last time about a month or two ago. I think it’s worth buying leatherface especially if you can get a sale. I’m expecting a sale event for the three year anniversary anyway so it would be a good idea to save up for then. Leatherface has 3 really good teachables (Knockout for slug builds, BBQ for bloodpoints, and Franklin’s Demise for Survive with Friend teams). Whenever you are angry, you can always play insidious basement leatherface and just facecamp them. You’ll receive hate mail for sure and the reactions are priceless.

Try to do a gen while an urban evading Quentin or Claudette is coming towards you, and you get a mini-heartattack because you thought it's piggy.
---
But, I wanna message survivors to wish them good luck and  play my Pig games.
---
Stu dated Casey. They broke up and she got with Steve. They mention it in the movie in the beginning when they are all talking about the first murders. Billy prob told Stu that he would help kill them if Stu helped him.
---
Lol, see I knew you were young. Because it's not a boring movie but I can see how someone young who has grown up with 20 years since of horror films would find it boring. It revolutionized a lot of the things about slasher films. Plus I mean it's 23 years old so it is an old film at this point and that can feel boring to someone.
---
Badoop 👉😎👉
---
The ghostface mask and the scream franchise are owned by two different groups. Negotiating both licenses at once would be a nightmare, so they got the mask and made their own ghostface, hence no Sidney.
---
As for Legion, we know that they were working on getting the license way back when Spirit came out because the license holder was talking about it. So there was no need for them to want to make a knockoff ghost-face. Legion's an original idea they wanted to use that just happened to share some similarities. The core concept of Legion is really nothing like Ghostface or a scream killer.
---
I would love to hear your theories on the killers deaths!
---
This game can be alot of fun or the complete opposite, depending who youre playing with/against. Also depending what system youre getting it on you could run into more or less DCs and "sweaty" players. I mainly play survivor and ran into that issue on more than one occasion, and as killer im getting at least 1-2 DCs every couple games. Its not a bad game, cuz you can have alot of good games and definitely some very bad ones too. If you have friends that play it, thats a good way to pick things up kind of quick. Definitely worth giving a shot
---
It's actually getting it's major rework patch today with progression, unique characters (not just survivor reskins!) and unique powers. Should be more than just a Meg mask DLC after today ;)
---
"Ghost Face" chapter  
---
No mention of a survivor or map  
---
No movie locations in the trailer
---
They got the rights to the mask, but the rest of my theory is apparently correct
---
This guys model is so good. The environment is so great too - Such a waste! What are the devs doing?
---
Based on the current roadmap they have set up, if it's going to take them 2 years, it's for a good reason and will turn out great.
---
I'm just happy they are aware that the current map design is problematic for the games overall balance and flow.
---
It should be really hard to escape if hatch gets closed mate
---
This man deserves the chance to slam a pallet on Ghostface.
---
DIIIIIG DEEEEP
---
Well people still dc against legion after the nerf.
---
Ghostface built them a swing before killing them. Case closed.
---
Bill says otherwise. They decided against it for marketing I suppose but they set up the paragraph idea real early.
---
Okay.
---
Why is the cashier looking up so high at the end? Ghost face would have to be on top of the checkout conveyor belt looking down at him.... Cashiers model looks SO good. Strange that this was approved.
---
If you camp you dont rank up, quite rightly honestly. You arent showing any skill
---
&gt; We know y’all shadow nerfed bloodwebs of bloodpoint offerings.
---
Link to proof?
---
Much love
---
Well i was told im being reported because they didnt get to infinite loop me on haddonfield.
---
I'm mostly downvoting you for making the s in only cosmetics and battlepass dollar signs. Either go big or go home with that.
---
I mean most new maps they bring out suck so im not bothered, there are still tons of fixes needed on spirit/legion map
---
Probably somewhere in the forums. But I noticed when I got Laurie to p3 in July of 2018 I had atleast 8 of every green bloodpoint offering (excluding bps), with 11-13 of the yellow offerings, and I just prestiged meg and I have 1-2 of the green offerings and 3-4 of yellow.
---
OH shit sorry, I didn't clarify lol. I meant that referring to the people calling people entitled and selfish and shit like that. Wasn't saying you were bashing anybody at all fam
---
I think everyone did at one point ahaha. I used to wear it around the house when I was like 10 and wouldnt take it off
---
It would be nice to get the packaged content deal like the other chapters have. but as other people have pointed out, we got Ashe Williams VERY recently, new liscensed killer cosmetics added AND more on the way, and new cosmetics in general. Tbh, there are alot of things to complain about when it comes to BHVR, DBD and it's various issues, but the Scream chapter not having more content is definitely not something we should be complaining about.
---
I find it interesting that they’re doing Ghostface as the summer killer when he’s literally called The Icon of Halloween. I liked when they used to do a killer every Halloween. Would’ve been smart to do a Child’s Play chapter now if they’re ever going to do it instead due to the free promotion they’ll get from the movie. I think Ghostface is launching 3 days before it comes out.
---
That’s what I’m saying.
---
Have faith brothers.. Or we will boycott the entity by not playing the game so it cant get stronger ggez
---
First of all, forget what this people is telling you about patrolling. This may work at rank 15, but doesnt go any longer. At purple or red rank you need to learn how to play properly, wich is more than pressing M1, mindgames ore using your power.
---
You need to spread pressure, so the survivors can not work on gens. Not tunneling or camping, always keep them injured, rotate and slug when needed. See Fungoose on Twitch, he is the best killer Ive seen.
---
I'm actually really excited to try out the new rework on the free weekend.
---
Shit. Well I had too many brews. Happy to see what agree on the same shit.
---
Fuck I have 1100 auric cells saved for ghosface but he just got competition
---
Whoa, Ghostface! This comes out of nowhere!
---
That's awesome, the Nurse was so close to you too! Good job :)
---
r/entitledgamers
---
They dc no matter what.
---
They are the same type to ask for nerfs if they cannot deal with her with one loop for 5 gens.
---
Oh, that sub actually exists? .-.
---
Loomis killed Sidney's mom because she had an affair with his dad and then wanted Sidney dead too because of it too
---
Every other kill was probably just for fun tho
---
So, it's not something "we know". Just your speculations.
---
Ahhh I’ll be honest, I missed that part. I accidentally tuned out a few of the early conversations but decided not to rewind. Dude’s still not the smartest though.
---
In those ranks people run in straight lines so getting a 4k and double pip is not that surprising tbh
---
I get that Chucky and the Child’s Play series are iconic in the horror community, especially the slasher sub-genre that makes this game thrive. However, Chucky wouldn’t work in a way that would make sense and not make him look a bit ridiculous. He’d have to be scaled up, size wise, and his only real power is his stature aside from the slashing. Pallets, Windows, and his movement speed would all be really big issues for him if they did a Chucky chapter. 
---
I think the remedy for this is a good old fashioned Behaviour original killer that is in the same vein as Chucky, Perhaps a mannequin that was possessed by the entity?
---

*GASP* THAT WOULD BE SO DOPEEE
---
Generally survivors tend to travel in packs, especially when they are Gen rushing. If the survivors are escaping the traps as fast as you say they are, and they are doing this consistently, it means two or more survivors are together. Generally it takes a good 10-15 seconds, sometimes even longer, to chance your RNG out of a trap.
---
There was definitely always one in the family, my cousins would bring theirs over every Halloween
---
Oh shit you're right omegalul
---
It's out? Welp, time to get me wallet
---
Killers when Their Devour Hope gets destroyed by a P3 bushette who disappears right after the killer sees them.
---
Clown wheezes alot and kept pinkies and trinkets in a cigar box sounds like emphysema or cancer in the lungs. Wraith killed a mob boss and then just disappeared. Usually if you were to do something that big you would have to face repercussions but it's just speculation that the mob made him sleep with the fishes. The legion gang was at a abandon ski resort. They went to dump a body when frank seen something and left the group. The group followed him deep into the woods trying to locate him. Resorts often have dangerous restricted areas because of steep inclines and the risk of avalanches.  The wraith and legion are the most speculation because of their models. They are some of the ones with nothing particularly damaging to them.
---
Hopefully they figure something out with the license for F13. But I think the F13 Reboot is safe from all the bullshit. So maybe we can get reboot Jason.
---
I can’t wait! As a millennial, this is a killer of my generation!
---
Maybe after the previous leaks, they're just *saying* there's no map or survivor to throw us off? 
---
I know it's not the case but I'm hopeful.
---
Uhm.. Hello?
---
You’re not going to “destroy” a good swf. You underestimate how much of an advantage communication is to good survivors. Sure you’ll do better than most killers, but every killer will struggle against a good swf. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, i am aware the spirit is strong, but even with prayer beads I don’t think she’s number 1
---
What if they’re statues?! They did say they were releasing a bunch of them when the Wraith one dropped?! 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
To be honest I was pig and she scared me more than I did her.
---
Hahahahahha
---
I once did this exact thing, and I was so shocked I forgot to even run away.. Turns out she hadn't even seen me so my panic actually saved me
---
🖑
---
You could've just cropped the picture, put a little effort into something.
---
Surely not. Do you have any idea of what it might be?
---
Ah dope !
---
i understand about the voice comm part, but she has immense map pressure and when shes invisible you cant do call outs, or at the very least it makes it harder, i been on both sides and I can tell you at least on console you will destroy. I have also been on the 4man survivor side and the only problems we ever have are against good spirits with prayer beads. The only killer that maybe is better than spirit is a god tier nurse and we dont have many on console but i have seen gameplay on pc. I still think a god prayer bead spirit with MD ring is as good or better than nurse.
---
I had a Billy saw me at the gates when I was injured with MoM. It worked like a charm and got me right out. It was totally a crutch perk moment.
---
I play as killer with Haunted Grounds and this happens so much I love it, I'll be mid swing or about to swing and it activates
---
Fuck Sidney, I want cashier guy. He’s THICCER than Jane.
---
Yea you can use balanced or if you have dead hard I’d recommend that over sprint burst
---
When I regularly did tournaments, this was common as to throw off the killer's sense of awareness.
---
Is this loss?
---
When he's injured he sounds like he's being bonked. 
---
For similar reasons I can't play as Meg, her asthmatic breathing all the time is horrible.
---
I think they should change the wording then. It says I won a percentage of the chases instead of getting hits.
---
I can’t speak for console gameplay, I’ve only played on pc. Maybe because i use Iron will I manage to get away from spirit half the time. Thing is with spirit in hindsight i can always think of something i could have done differently, often against nurses I honestly can’t think about how i could have played a situation better.
---
That's why you equip items during the last 5 seconds. The killer usually won't have enough reaction time to equip Franklin's.
---
You're not the only one, I thought the cashier would be the survivor.
---
Late night walks with *shirtless* Myers
---
Not like they've been working on EGC and other things along with that. We got a cool survivor before hand and now we're getting Ghostface AND the Freddy rework very soon.
---
Please either think about what you're going to type before you send it, or work on your social skill or how you present yourself on the internet.
---
Losing a game or loop and being slugged or gens being done means you had wrong perks or played wrong. Not being saved means YOU die for someone elses mistake. Yes you could not get hooked, but if a killer wants you at the start they will get you. So not being saved is in my book worthy of trashtalking.
---
At the same time I’m also confused because a survivor only wins a chase when they get away and if they were feeding you like you said,if they were running in your sight and then running away and then you see someone else it breaks the chase and that means you loose the chase and they won so if they were doing that sort of thing then that could be why as well. Happens a lot with hook divers.
---
I honestly did not know they were separate. Assumed all the same. I just feel Sidney is to me the second most iconic “victim” (for lack of a better word) in horror film history behind only Laurie. I’m biased as I grew up in the 90s but that’s what I feel. I don’t think other franchises or movies had such an iconic actor/actress like Halloween with Laurie (Curtis) and Scream with Sidney (Campbell).
---
I suggest not playing those two killers. If you need a stronger chase game play trapper or someone that has a weaker power until you are good without having a chainsaw burst or legions dash attack. I learned to play using freddy because everyone said he was garbage and now I'm just starting to learn console nurse and it helps being able to track and cut people off on common loops.
---
Yeah i know, but now i have like 25% cut off from top and bottom. And i dont know if you are familiar with it but (and i am 100% on side of this fairness when it comes to fov) there is an option as it was eg in F13 - fisheye effect. You see exactly the same as it is in 16:9 but with slight fisheye. Its not noticeable after some time and it helps a lot
---
You should get tougher friends. Never heard of people not playing game because it’s “toxic”. Mine are just douches that won’t hop off Apex long enough to try DBD.
---
Definitely. The biggest problem about it is that the perk has no counterplay, as hitting survivors is something you obviously can't avoid. So if they would make it more difficult for a survivor to get the stacks it would be ok.
---
tbh ur an idiot if you think its time based. Even if it was, legally, everyone who purchased it would be retracted the character, and this "time-based" license would appear on the rules/guildlines and before purchasing the character... which it isnt either. Think about any other licensed video game characters, like mk9, freddy is still playable. Or mkx, leatherface,alien,predator,jason are all still playable
---
I can tell when I'm the killer who wastes pallets and who doesnt. If you go through 5 or 6 before I even hit you that's a waste. Especially if I still down you afterwards. You did all that for nothing and it only helped me the killer not you. Its selfish or at the least ignorant. If you throw down those pallets and the killer chases you for five gens good job. You kept him busy. At the end of the match it's only wasting if it gets people caught because they wont have anything to use. It sucks getting found after you know a teammate threw down every pallet in the area around a gen.
---
I saw a wraith sitting in the corner just watching the game. He had rancor so I knew where he was but he had no intentions of moving or interacting with anyone. So I dropped my item in front of him and then proceeded to loot every chest I could find and bring him the items.  After game he thanked me for the items.
---
He just doesnt admit faults. I guess in confidence you could call it narcissism? Hes never wrong.
---
This ain't the Scream chapter, this is the Ghostface chapter.
---
A Scream chapter/paragraph with a survivor, map, and classic ghostface cosmetic, is all still possible for certain, probably even a little more likely now.
---
It is obvious that the killer goes to the farthest away gen from him, because that's how spawning works and there is guaranteed to be a survivor there...
---
That's why we never got Reboot Jason in the actual F13 game.
---
Now that's the way more of us should be thinking like
---
I understand, it just feels weird you know.
---
If you have a high ping as killer everyone does. It sounds like you are getting into matches with high pinged killers and that could also be because of your connection. If I have a bad connection in one match and ask the killer the ping and it's not high it's because of me. Trying clearing out catches and resetting your internet router. If that doesnt fix it then I dunno.
---
*killers disconnect right after the loading completes (literally yesterday)*
---
Not really, BBQ is the way to go. Nurses is great as well, I dont deny that, but BBQ feels better ALONE for the BPs.
---
When’s the free weekend? I never got to try the game out
---
Who else has been jumpscared when the surv drops a pallet around the corner and it catches your hand as you try to lunge at them? Always scares the shit out of me cause I don't see the pallet, I stop moving, and I hear either a scream or a roar (depending on killer)
---
That's my brand!
---
True
---
of course people are going to be dissapointed.. some people dont play killer, like myself. i play this game to survive with friends. Yes adding ghostface is cool but obviously people who dont play killer want a new survivor as well.
---
&gt; the art has nothing to do with a person
---
The person in this case makes money if you use their art.  If you don't want to do business with and be associated with said person, then you choose not to use said art.
---
Calm down
---
I guess that’s good for a beginner
---
I heard it's gonna be more lore friendly.
---
...So I guess people will turn their backs and be like "You're not real!" to make him wanish, lol. Or he might posses one survivor to enter the real world for a moment like he did with Jesse.
---
But with our luck, we're probably wanishing, lol.
---
That's very true uwu thanks for the hope haha
---
I like the idea of the change they suggested where MoM requires the survivor to take protection hits to activate it. However I think asking for 3 protection hits is a bit much and would make the perk too weak. To get that many protection hits you basically have to throw yourself at the killer, countering the extra health state reward. I'd suggest one of two options. 
---
1. Receiving a protection score event as a survivor activates MoM. The next time you receive a protection score event, you do not take any damage.
---
2. After receiving the protection score event twice, MoM becomes active. The next time you take damage that would put you into the dying state, that damage is negated.
---
Plus that standalone survivor was goddamn ASH WILLIAMS, like jesus christ they even got Bruce campel to do custom voice lines AND released 3 different cosmetics for it. The fact we're even getting a new *licensed* killer so soon is outstanding.
---
I really hope using an ebony mori at rank 19 is not considered indicative of the normal killer experience.
---
Yea unless you prefer a more stealthier play style. Dead hard and balanced are more situationally useful
---
Thye wouldnt need to size chucky. We have several post on how to make him viable with new mechanics that arent too complex. I think if he could change between a zero terror radius doll and his human self that would work the best.
---
That's because the hood and mask are separate pieces and the mask is sliding under the hood.
---
As an m1 killer (meaning he has to rely on basic attacks), spirit-fury (spirit) and enduring (hillbilly) are highly recommended for him so he can swing through pallets efficiently.
---
As a stealth killer, he benefits from nurses calling (nurse) to sneak up on healing survivors.
---
As a first-hit killer, he can make the most of sloppy butcher (all) since he can easily injure survivors and tag them with slower healing.
---
Also as a mobile first-hit killer, he can make good use of exposure (instant-down) perks. Make your choice (pig), Devour hope (hag), Haunted ground (spirit) all are good on him because he can quickly get to exposed survivors and get a hit on them before they get somewhere safe.
---
I recommend this guy for builds, game knowledge, and general tips: https://youtu.be/L1VneL4Ip5M
---
It's not. I think at the time they were having to pay for rights to reboot the first friday film but they didnt do that. They labeled that movie as a sequel and not a reboot to avoid paying victor Miller money. That's what victor said in a interview I watched atleast.
---
I loved this mask when I was little. I was literally going to my kindergarten with this on my face. I have no idea why the teacher let me. It's kinda fucked when you think about it, lol.
---
but then you find the inmersed claudette, and you feel inclined to say it.. but you can’t
---
The developers of Dead By Daylight cannot force the license holders to let them use their intellectual property.  I understand maybe being upset if we don't get a map *if this is the only character content we get until September*, but people are acting like they could have put Sidney into the game if they just worked a little bit harder.
---
A guy last night was saying that BVHR made a poor business business and deserve to be punished for not including a map, Trust me, theres people who're upset.
---
uuuuuugh
---
The Freddy rework will not make him worse as long as they give him the ability to hit survivors without some catastrophic downside.  ....... Like that it's.  If he can hit survivors right away without using his power and keeps 115% movement speed, that is an instant buff over what his current state is.  Even if it's 110% movement speed there is a decent argument it would still be a buff.
---
It isn't growing, it was just literally people downloading for a free weekend.
---
When they got into the lobby, they were the same character with the same outfit, but they changed to 4 different characters before the match started, which was kind of strange.
---
Justice for Cashier Guy! I would main him.
---
Is it really the identical names that causes this or something else?
---
your teammates played horribly
---
Bill was released at a time without a definite roadmap, though.
---
I mean, being dead and all he wouldnt be able to do much anyway XD
---
fam it takes no jokes about 30 m1s to get your chaser upto iridescent, shits broken
---
They just advertise it as a noose
---
They can't force the Scream license holders to let them use their intellectual property.
---
For Sidney Prescott specifically, it is unreasonable to blame the devs for something they probably cannot reasonably control.
---
They mentioned some "Big Surprises".
---
As a Quentin main I'm hoping its cosmetics for my boy. 
---
It would make more sense to get Freddy cosmetics, but honestly does that guy ever wear anything else apart from that red sweater?
---
Shirtless David, even.
---
Yeah, barely.
---
Welp there goes my dream for another indoor map.
---
If we get Quentin cosmetics, I’ll buy the Elm Street chapter when they come out... bet.
---
The problem was and still is that steam charts lists its average players as 2.2 over the last 30 days.  I would be afraid to buy this after a free weekend, and I am concerned that could have a drag on potential renewed interest.
---
Its the identical names, atleast when I messed around with it that was the cause. I think I first noticed this half a year ago when I was messing around with a friend of mine and gave myself the same name, the UI somehow just cant handle that. Forgot about it untill a week ago and tried to do another meme build and it happened again, especially against the plague it can get really confusing if both get infected and the UI starts having seizures.
---
For clarification: I really hope they are not balancing the game around rank 19 with an ebony mori.
---
Put on iron will, don't run around - just do a generator and wait for a survivor to come find you. 
---
This way you will be actually useful to the team, instead of wasting HALF A GENERATOR OF PROGRESS on healing 1 health state that you will probably lose anyway because people with self-care tend to have little chase experience or skill.
---
I... actually  think it's fully fine and I main killer, I just use it to my advantage because they can't heal then
---
Maybe there is a survivor and map coming to the game but behaviour do not want to spoil the fun with it so they will just say it just a killer or they have a second killer
---
Absolutely yes.
---
Chests exist. I don't run Franklin's on EVERYONE, just Clown and Leatherface.
---
I would be so happy if we got shirtless Quentin skin
---
Bond will always be meta contrary to selfcare specially if you play Solo.
---
But what is more interesting than selfcare anyway is : just bring a medkit, bring pharmacy, do gens until someone with a healin build come to heal you.
---
never ever selfcare, only villains do that.
---
How do we communicate with BHVR to tell them how much we want this supermarket map and this cashier? 
---
A supermarket would be really different from what we have and add a lot of variety to the game.
---
"Sucker hahahaha**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!**"
---
Couldn't that be considered cheating?
---
Lots of people have 'weird' kinks. Can't help liking something.
---
As a 50/50 killer/survivor main, I dislike both NOED and Adrenaline. In my opinion, NOED is justifiable against, and only against, survivors using Adrenaline. My problem with NOED however, is that it punishes survivors without Adrenaline way too harshly.
---
The purpose of my suggestion is that the more survivors using and getting healed by adrenaline, the more they get punished.
---
The perk is counterable by healing before the generators are completed. This takes time, and may not be worth it, but can make it much easier to escape.
---
I don't think so. They should focus more on the lvl ,where players with a lot of gametime are sitting.  There quite some imbalances on both sides
---
If you refund Deathgarden, do they also take Meg's mask away?
---
I don't think this is even possible, considering how bad he is atm
---
If anyone plays Cashier Guy I will drop my chainsaw and chase you out the gate with flowers and a smile
---
I believe it's not automatically removed but it could easily be retroactively be done by the people at BHVR
---
&gt;Save
---
Hes wearing a ring on his ring finger
---
Or maybe this,
---
Killer making lobby: Has to select perks, addons and offerings, which will then be fixed until game starts.
---
Survivor joining lobby: Character does not display for killer until survivor selects perks, item, addons and offerings which will then be fixed until game starts.
---
So if I get this right, the survivors can potentially get a 20 second EGC?  
---
In my opinion, Adrenaline isn't that strong a perk, as it only helps you survive once a game while other perks like Balanced Landing, Sprint Burst or even Dead Hard(on a good survivor) can save you multiple times in a single game.  
---
Adrenaline is just more painful; you sometimes just see all survivors heal to full from injured and think where your work has gone?
---
Thats a fat fucking oof from me bro, must hurt BHVR.
---
Yes, i know first hand.
---
That would nerf killers. If you see 4 man swf with items you select franklins and now you can no longer do that.
---
Yes they did. Just check the steam shop.
---
Sat here waiting for that one guy who doesn't understand what a "shitpost" is and says "What the fuck, it's a game why would you get mad?"
---
Broke: using BPS with your best add ons because you can get a lot of points with your best add ons and the BPS doubles that. 
---
Woke: using BPS with your best add ons because the survivors won't disconnect due to the BPS, so you can enjoy a 4v1 with your best add ons.
---
Actually one of the comunity managers said on the forums that a chapter can refer to one character, just like the ash dlc, they called it a chapter aswell.
---
It was only free for the weekend, you didnt "own" the game after that. Never been free to own on PC.
---
It's coming to Game Pass on Xbox. And it was the free game of the month on PS4 a few months ago.
---
When it comes to Game Pass....be prepared for server overload.
---
I really hope they will reanimate it. I like so many things about the concept, but never actually played it because I don't play betas, and after that the game died quickly
---
The add-ons only increase the size and Intoxication duration, not the cloud duration.
---
Bing Bong best boi
---
Wow I'll try it thanks!
---
I must have misunderstood your comment, whatever :P
---
True :D
---
Is it a Chapter or a Paragraph though...
---
&gt; you also need to consider the fact they released a stand-alone Survivor two weeks after the last full chapter,
---
I'll go ahead and say it;
---
I can't speak for everyone, but as an Evil Dead fanboy if we didn't currently have Ash and were still waiting for Evil Dead Representation I'd be perfectly fine with that.
---
As a stand alone chapter, Ash is missing out on most of his iconic features (Chainsaw hand, boomstick, the cabin, the Necronomicon, the handful of villians he has, I could go on). I mean, I'm happy he's in the game don't get me wrong, but if we were still waiting for  Ash Williams, The Doppleganger (Evil Ash, complete with Chainsaw and shotgun), and The Cabin in the Woods, I'd be more than willing to wait a while for the whole deal.
---
They should always have a killer and survivor in a DLC. With maps they should focus on balancing the current ones (fking loop heavens...)
---
Probably so they won't lose pips?  
---
The killer shroud offering only hurts them; it spawns survivors on separate gens, so they can get progress on 4 different gens instead of the usual 1-2.
---
To kill every man you meet
---
Calm down, Dwight, damn.
---
When u need to sneeze but it won’t come out
---
What's your discord user name bruv?
---
Nope
---
Aww :(
---
No one? Surely. It takes two seconds to see it was Dead by Daylight official YouTube channel that posted the trailer
---
Leatherface is worth it just for the economy gains with bloodpoints.
---
Other than that, its all down to preference. 
---
Freddy and Pig aren't in a good spot right now.
---
Freddy at the moment has a niche that people are overstating due to some kind of hipster effect but hes not the best.
---
Shape has always been good and I would argue most players have satisfying matches playing as him, he captures the essence of this game.
---
It's a small discord for ppl who wanna get swf squads
---
I still have one of these in my dresser drawer. 🤘
---
We got a variant of the swamp with Bubba iirc
---
You know there still is one person. There always is.
---
Indeed. We just get Ghostface next month. No map or survivor.
---
Lmao still not a reason to DC
---
lmao i just love her &amp; think a team of Gales would be hilarious
---
Nobody thinks it's fake. This post is pointless.
---
I think a normal door in the Game is 2meters
---
And what, she spilled orange juice on it?
---
Had pretty close to this exact same scenario happen to me, but fortunately I was leveling Tapp and had Tenacity equipped.
---
It's damn intense when this happens. Especially that end bit where you have to crawl through the gates and hope the killer isn't anywhere near you.
---
Use perks like Whispers to learn it.
---
Like a doorway? Okay!
---
Okay, thank you! It just is confusing to grasp because I’ll think I’m 40 meters or closer to a hook, and then the killer zooms over to me.
---
Behavior just needs to punish DC'ers much harder i.e. taking AWAY bloodpoints from their "wallet" or whatever its called where you store the BP
---
Probably the cashier
---
Let's have a perk that counters another perk yeah.
---
Sometimes people don't understand that not every perk needs a counterplay.
---
Call the koreans
---
The fun fact is that it was nerfed to 12%. It was 15% a long time ago.
---
Nah dude, MoM is balanced, I should be able to endure a hit just because I've been hit before
---
Killers just need to *adapt*
---
On the end game chat i was expecting salt, but they knew that it was stupid leave the hook
---
i think it was kind of obvious
---
No one wanted end game collapse, ash is just one guy and all he adds to the game is MOM, which is super generic and getting slapped on every build imaginable, freddy could still be broken after the fix, so we'll so how that is when we see it.   
---
I credit them for getting licensed skins, and their recent work on getting ghost face is great, but it is not up to par with what we usually get when we pay for a chapter. I get that a new map would be hard, but it wouldve been the perfect opportunity to get a proper school, but eh, not super worried about maps. I still would have liked to see a new survivor tho
---
Wait we not getting a supermarket map?
---
I couldn't care less. I'm a killer main and I'm not disappointed, maybe a little bit for the map. You guys got Ash.
---
Spirit too. Really distorts the grass moving if you use prayer beads
---
The tbag bond is the strongest yet. I would do the same for you my dearest friend.
---
4 now 👏👏
---
Oh God I am in a metro and it's 9pm here, I laughed like a mad man
---
Yeah, just sit on a generator and someone will find me... the killer for example.
---
I mean, not healing in general is a strategy one can use, but one I'm not fond of, as I do like staying alive throughout the trial. Can't do generators if you're on the hook and someone has to waste time to get you off, or if you're dead.
---
But I guess you consider No Mither true OP tier then.
---
*cries while remembering legion changes*
---
I agree. DC'ers need some kind of punishment if they keep DC'ing.
---
&gt;No one wanted the endgame collapse
---
Fucking what??? Removal of the hatch stand off has been begged for 2 years, together with fleshing out the end game.
---
Many people love Ash as a character, be it that he gets overlooked because Mettle is such cancer
---
I will come back to this comment tomorrow
---
Fair enough
---
I always turn my back to them when getting healed so we all can enjoy some kinky butt rubb.
---
NOED already completely counters Adrenaline, and Stridor partly counters Iron will. I don't get your point.
---
I was letting a two person survivor team do gens because two of their teammates DC'd, as I was letting them heal each other I used that to test out the length of Nurse's Calling, so that's a good way to test as well.
---
from 20-15 thats pretty much everything. 14-11 you get a lot of guys who think they know what they are doing, but you mostly get fucked by how bad the other survivors are. 10-6 is a really nice balanced place
---
People don't like the spirit, even without prayer beads I've been getting a lot of shit recently just for playing her. It is what it is.
---
Sooooo close to the death
---
Dc'ing has kinda become a standard in this game. There should be taken actions against dc'ers
---
Stop crying people.
---
Damn
---
lol
---
Sounds fun! I suppose you can make a similar effect with an active and an inactive RBT.
---
Glad you're happy most people are just whining about no map or survior release
---
If someone heals you, that's still 20 seconds that person and you are not doing generators, amounting to 2 times 20 seconds lost and now I'm going to use my awesome math degree... LE GASP it's 40 seconds lost in total.
---
Billy: the cosmic chad
---
Huntress: good at singing, surprisingly skilled athlete, has very heavy Russian accent
---
Cannibal: does a lot of parties and is responsible for bringing food during almost every party the group has
---
Freddy: edgelord who just had puberty (the... mating part) kick in
---
r/cursedcomments
---
I'd rather none than ones that aren't in the movies. Would be cool though if this was secretly teasing a future supermarket map with the cashier and the yet to see killer. Okay I'll stop dreaming.
---
Yo homie you seeing this shit?
---
GAUD damn
---
&gt;  i haven't heard anything about this
---
?????????????????????????????
---
Any map?
---
🤩
---
i havent seen the movies but when i saw the trailer i knew those things were references to the movies, guess i was right
---
I love that you just copied the same comment lmao
---
Just give Freddy his trenchcoat from New Nightmare. Done
---
Hatch stand offs are annoying yes, but now that hatches become active with literally no gens done, you can play a perfect game as killer, never allowing a single gen to be completed, and someone still just gets out. The game should play normally until 3 gens remain, then hatch becomes active and you can close it, activating collapse. It just feels so sloppy. And I know a lot of people do like ash, but for a lot of people the hype died pretty quick, and hes more obnoxious than anything else. If it had to between ash and getting the map/survivor for ghostface, you know who everyone would have picked
---
Hmmm nurse has counter :)
---
Haunted grounds*  
---
Made me chuckle a little bit
---
Just so you know, there are people who may think YOU are hot and others who think YOU are ugly as shit.
---
That's kinda how it works. So instead of questioning why others find someone hot that you don't, and acting like your perception of someones beauty is the standard and better than others (hint: it's not), how about you just leave them be and enjoy what you like.
---
Kthxbai
---
Alright thank you!
---
imagine trying to loop around coffee break tables lol.. atleast you would have the nice looking biscuits and sandwiches to look at whilst being chased by a killer.. probably make you hungry though, only downside.
---
Its cgi. Probably mocapped tho
---
I’ve never been more surprised to check a post flair and see something other than Shitpost...
---
When i first heard the news about us only getting Ghost face, i really didn't mind. But honestly after seeing the Ghost face trailer and seeing the indoors shop i'm really bummed out they couldn't somehow make that into a map and release along with Ghost face. We need more indoors maps and this one could have been amazing.
---
Encouraging people to stay at gates for killer to down them so they can get a few more points. No thanks. I'd rather save the time cus I know survivors would stay and waste my time as killer, speaking from experience as survivor.
---
Note: I do hope there is more but I’m thinking from what the community has gathered so far, these are the surprises.
---
it's number 4 now!!!
---
I want to know this killer.
---
I mean, they might be calling them surprises because they haven’t confirmed any of them
---
whats really annoying is they flick your mouse towards the trap every time, thats frustrating
---
This. I took a break and started playing a month ago again, and it was annoying to play against billy with lower ranks as everyone would instantly go down by the chainsaw lol. Like any other killer, you can loop him and force him to m1 you
---
The Hillbilly is a little over 2 meters tall.  He is 6' 8'' and 2 meters ~6' 6''.
---
If that's your first thought instead of thinking people actually just wanting a fucking character then you have issues, sorry.
---
Maybe because the game isn't supposed to be symmetrical? If there'd be counterplay to everything in a 1v1 scenario then why even bother to play killer anymore because it's literally of no use of trying anymore?
---
Yep, I'll uninstall then, i don't have a high end riug to wait for dual-core Console players.
---
Microsoft and Steam will never have crossplay. You can downvote es much as you want, won't change it.
---
That’s how I feel.  Or when you’re on the hook and you have 3 survivors really far and they all assume that someone will else will get you.
---
Then you go into struggle and then they all stop what they’re doing and run for you (or just stay where they are still hoping for the best).
---
No Sydney or new map, yeah talk about lazy. Extremely disappointed.
---
Haha nice list, all of them accurate 😄
---
Don't think they could get the Joy division t-shirt stuff but they could come close , would be nice for some stuff for all the licensed characters
---
They'll talk about the new map rework philosophy aswell.
---
EZ CLAP
---
Hey what do you typically run for nurse perk wise? And any tips for her? If no tips that's fine id mostly like to hear your perks.
---
I'm guessing you have sensitivity maxed too?
---
This gave me anxiety, you never look behind when you run!?
---
Is there actually confirmation there is no map and survivor? I can't see them doing this.... at least give us a map
---
What an absolute mad lad.
---
Where
---
Please! Please give Quentin his bloody beanie
---
Did you hear of this shadow nerf somewhere or is this your assumption? Because i've noticed way less bp offerings myself. Way less green and survivor puddings are once every 40 fkin levels
---
It's just called "Ash Vs Evil Dead", not a Chapter
---
Thar may be true, but there really isnt much to do about that until the dedicated servers come. But 9 times out of 10 people DC due to getting downed when they think they shouldnt have, when in all actuality they got hit and are just pissed. There was times where i got downed whenvi thought i shouldnt have but i stayed in the game. You dont gain anything from DC-ing so whats the point? Get whatever BP you can
---
Thus is a pretty bad rework. Like imagine if survivors had a perk that just said "If playing against The Shape, he gains 5%/10%/15% less Evil Within progress when stalking you"
---
No one would play it because they don't know if they'll be up against The Shape every round
---
You must be pretty trash if you get looped as pig
---
You might want to make the lines a bit thicker and add light shadows around them.  
---
In game the details are very washed out, using them myself I ended up increasing the contrast on each one by 50% and lowering the brightness by 50% and while that helps the stronger details by making the lines thicker would be much more effective! \^\_\^
---
He was my favorite part of the trailer!
---
I'm not even ashamed to admit that I pre-ordered Deathgarden mainly for the masks (pre-order gave me deluxe edition for free). Only reason I played it was because one of my friends genuinely liked it and wanted me to join them.
---
Maybe do it based on distance crawled/time downed
---
at least add a new map please.. :(
---
If you want another character's perks for your main you will have to level up the character who owns that perk until orange perks appear in their trees (orange means that those perks will be teachable to any other character and they'll eventually appear on their trees). You can also buy some perks in the store every week for 2000 iridescent points
---
The other one might have been opened
---
I could not test them myself since I don't have the right to play , so thanks a lot for your feedbacks I'll try to fix that
---
Every survivor has 3 teachables specific to them. You can unlock that teachable in the bloodweb at levels 30, 35, and 40. Once you unlock that teachable you now will have those perks on any survivor you choose to level
---
Highly doubt it. Two DCs and only one other escape.
---
Also purple and pink keys only open hatches. And the wave thing is just an emote that everyone has. If you’re on console it’s on the D pad.
---
this was never a thing bud
---
Good for you I have close to 200 and I still sometimes lose my shit
---
This is BHVR.  I'm frankly expecting his current upsides to be gutted and replaced with an even worse power that's more in line with Clown since 90% of the complaints about him were chase related.
---
Yo u/glenOck help this boi out.
---
ever heard of using "/s"?
---
Take a better look buddy.  [https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1113112638047780864](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1113112638047780864)
---
You main pig and you dont even know how her base kit work , what do you want me to say
---
This is the stupidest rework ive ever seen posted here
---
I bet he's a top 5 killer and excels in chases after the rework.
---
And I’m pretty sure the outfit is still buyable. I only got it about a week ago.
---
Queen metioned in the Y3 Anniversary video "exclusivities that you guys don't know about". That heavily implies they know that some of the beans were spoiled but that there's still more we genuinely don't know about. 
---
Peanits also said in the DBD Forum that "we don't keep all of our eggs in one basket".
---
I hope these surprises will make up for the fact that we aren't getting a new map and survivor.
---
I was actually convinced you were rank 20. But the comments have already told you the things you were doing wrong.  So let’s say something you did right...       can uhh.   Anybody see anything?
---
Oh they'll disconnect anyway.
---
10$ for one outfit is already unhealthy monetization, at least a battle pass would get us more for our money
---
I do know her base kit lol
---
"special power which activates another special power"
---
Question is what are you trying to say?
---
Implementing her dash attacks is the real threat and  what takes skill but I guess you are lost.
---
I get what you're trying to say hiding her red stain with crouch and going for dash attacks to cut the survior whos trying to loop by coming from the opposite side
---
But dude this shit is hard I doubt you can pull it
---
This was a few months ago I took this screenshot, so it could have changed :)!
---
Noob here, why is that bad?
---
You forgot Mettle of Man. No ash player doesn't have Mettle of Man on
---
1. Don't hunt for Ruin. You waste too much time in doing so, unless you're incredibly lucky to find it early on. Instead, use Ruin as an opportunity to practice your ability to hit Great Skill Checks. The more consistent you get with Great Skill Checks, the better.  
---
2. Make sure to spread the generators out. Don't work on one and then move on to the one right next to the previous one. The closer the final generators are to one another, the easier of a time the killer will have protecting those final generators. Working on the generators near the middle of the map first is a solid plan, and you always want to crank out the unsafe\* generators first.  
---
3. Totems often spawn nearby generators. If you find a generator, check around for any totems, and if you find them you cleanse them. Lit or dull, doesn't matter, always cleanse totems.  
---
\*Unsafe meaning there are no nearby loops or pallets to retreat to, should the killer find you.
---
Honestly the only reason I have any hope for this rework is because the community will probably have a collective fit if he's not at least top 5 lol.
---
As much as I wanted Dewey so I could do my Buddy Cop duo with Tapp and Dewey...
---
I wouldn't mind having this pure chunky boi as a survivor.
---
Anything that affects the UI Icons really so yes probably
---
This hurts because people have used this argument against me unironically
---
I’m pretty sure this one is the one DBD based his default outfit on so I doubt they’d give us this one
---
Whats offering items and how does it work?
---
I usually just run around normal and I dish all my RBT's as fast as possible.
---
Thats what i say from the begining : its hard cause you dont know how to play her
---
It's like I main pig, sometimes wraith but going against even a 3 man running mom and bt makes you contemplate life lol
---
Honestly I'm not even going to get my hopes up for this being a side-grade.  As a Freddy player I'm going in fully expecting to watch my boi get butchered and put back together in some grotesque mockery of a worse killer.
---
I'm sorry, but between Clown, Plague, and Legion, I really don't have faith in the devs.  At this point I'm also pretty sure that Spirit was a fluke lol.
---
That was just one idea they had for the perk and taking multiple hits for a Survivor just doesn't happen. They woul done effectively killing the perk.
---
Fcking hell lol I just explained everything and you're out here
---
"don't know how to play her"
---
Peace out.
---
The fact that he assumed there would be one!   He has nothing to do with Dead By Daylight.  He just directed Scream.  He later corrected himself somewhere.  I don’t remember where though.
---
r/madlads
---
Me noticeing that ghostface power is just a myers sidegrade.
---
If the gen's almost done and the killer's on the way, COMMIT
---
Yeah. She escaped ;) She's actually rank 14 and I'm 15. She's a lot better than I am though. We still have a lot to learn after playing for less than a week but thanks.
---
Ooooo now this I love.
---
Why
---
How do you want me to call a pig main that doesnt know how to use the dash to her advantage ?
---
He already said a couple weeks ago that he didn’t know much and that we probably knew more than he did
---
Really hoping my joke actually came across as a joke.   It literally took me 3 days for my first escape.  So I can’t say nothing 😂
---
You have the door trapped for a downed survivor? Great job!
---
C H A P I T E R
---
Oh damn, I’m using my phone so I don’t think I can use that function. Thanks though!!
---
why is this a big deal,ash came out by himself and no one was complaining,now ghost face does it and now its not ok??
---
So when this hits mainstream viewers, imagine the confusion when they think this is a new movie coming out..
---
You lack the ability to properly express yourself.
---
*pepe laugh*

---
Thanks for the gold kind stranger.
---
Very Groovy, great work :).
---
Ayo, don't call that dog a loser! I am pretty sure he can get past rank 20 he just doesn't want to!
---
i understand the killers a lot, this is a tier list overall not just if you are pro at killer thats why i didnt pick nurse to be top cuz she is hard to control and stuff
---
Scary Movie is one of the best titles of its genre, but I suppose that doesn't matter to people who don't like parody flicks.
---
I advise this on every post i see thats like this, but my advice wont ever change. Download the Huntress dlc, it should be free. It comes with David King, who has the single best survivor perk. WGLF. It basically doubles your bloodpoint earnings. He also has Dead Hard, the second best exhaustion perk in the game. Level him up, get dead hard and WGLF as teachables (lvl 30 and 35 respectively) you can play him and level him as much as you want, but keep in mind his third teachable, No Mither, is one of the worst perks in the game.
---
Typically you should only throw down pallets when you absolutely need some extra chase time or if the killer is close enough to get stunned. Dropping all the pallets in a single area makes said area a lot less safe to get chased in later on in the match. With experience you'll better understand how to preserve pallets, though some survivors just don't end up learning yet make it to high ranks lol
---
Maybe you should check the pc and console release date PepeLaugh
---
As well as the 3rd year anniversary event, yeah.
---
Zoidberg!
---
Isn't it June  my man ?
---
Still does not fix problem, like how DS use to work with the obsession its basically a free escape for the obsession which takes barely any skill to use from the survivor player.
---
My perk load-out is Nurses Calling for tracking, Deerstalker so I can slug when needed, Hex: Devour Hope to get easier downs, and Make Your Choice to help with easier downs before your Devour activates and after it gets cleansed(I would replace this for BBQ &amp; Chili, but it hasn’t appeared in my bloodweb).
---
Never swing after blinking if you aren’t close enough(seems obvious but many nurses just always swing, and there’s a short period after each blink that can be used to check for the survivor).  When you see a survivor hiding, a cool trick that also works for the huntress is to charge your blink/hatchet as if you were blinking away/ going for a long shot then quickly turn to the survivor for an easier hit. They often remain in their spot rather than running away.
---
I also personally never run add ons because they mess up the Muscle memory.
---
Jeff: ‘excuse me what the fuck?’
---
One is 2016 ,the other is 2017 PepeLaugh
---
But yea i guess im a console player now :(
---
you don't want to be instadowned by her basic attack, so you give her an easy way to instadown EVERYONE from range. seems like a great idea! you'll get sick easily anyway so it's just not worth it
---
You are why people DC
---
A lot of people,  including myself,  would rather have less content but have it be done better overall.  BUT,  there are a lot of people who just gobble up content and without fresh content constantly they will just stray elsewhere.
---
&gt; Granted, the stun from Feral Frenzy ending is 3 seconds
---
It is 4 seconds, unless you stack Cold Dirt and Joe's mixtape.
---
Im pretty the terror radius ones work with the Legion and the iridescent button, but its not viable at all and trying to hit someone down with Frank's Mixtape is impossible.
---
Thank you guys for the tips 😊
---
I love this community.
---
They should add a suicide button
---
Love the puppet, you captured Papa Bruce's likeness extremely well! Keep it up!
---
Actually, if you thought this out more maybe they could add survival point instances for evading a killer while knocked down. Although it'd be hard to put in without encouraging people to not recover. It'd be good for anti-slugging though.
---
If he's playing daily and still rank 19, he's probably not stomping new players or he would have ranked up.  I suppose he could be resetting his rank, but i doubt that.
---
Best tip I can give you is to watch gameplay on youtube or to wach twitch streams. Playing killer yourself next to playing survivor can help you understand the game’s base mechanics
---
No it wasn’t, Scream was insanely popular even back in the day, made a ton of money and inspired a whole bunch of new horror
---
Ehh check my comment I said in my own experience of playing the game on console I've faced comparatively bad surviors compared to pc but go off I guess
---
#Wewantcashierguy
---
If you watched the video you'd see it closed
---
not in general for a pro yes but for none pro she isnt
---
He could have embers coming off of him too
---
Sure, but I don't think you understand the concept of a Paragraph. A Paragraph is a standalone DLC character whereas a Chapter is a DLC containing a Map, Survivor and Killer. BHVR somehow decided they should completely throw the consistency of that in the water though.
---
And Adrenaline gives you a free health state just for making it to the endgame. NOED gives you a free down. Rancor lets you kill and mori the obsession, with NO downside.
---
Let's not act as though MoM is the only perk in the game that's powerful. A good amount of killers can circumvent MoM completely. I think it'd be a fine tradeoff to only allow one survivor to use current MoM.
---
YEAH LOL WHAT AN IDIOT SHE IS 
---
*sweats*
---
but I bet she'll totally remember to do that next time...
---
Wow this is beautiful. Well done!
---
Also, we already have ash as a survivor
---
I actually do like parodies though, I like Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th better, which is another Scream parody that came out around the same year if not a bit earlier.
---
And I’m one of those people who finds enjoyment in Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, etc. lmao
---
Swimwear Quentin or we riot
---
o7
---
Maybe with enough demand they'll release him
---
For Deathgarden not DbD.
---
I actually enjoyed this tale, survivors tend to think killers need to just hand them the game. Great success story
---
Carl the Cashier. A hero amongst men.
---
The Wraith looks the best tbh
---
In the leak the perk was revealed. Basicly its like STBFL but it gets stacks when hiting the obsesion. It decreases your TR in chase with each stack.
---
Thanks, that took the longest haha
---
Traps slow the game down and the no terror radius thing canbe useful. Her charge is pointless against good players, do not use
---
i have moris but i dont use em cus i wsnt bloodpoints
---
Yeah, I remember as a kid wanting a game with all my favorite slashers so badly, I thought it'd never happen haha, and thank you, I appreciate it!
---
As much as i would've loved to have Sydney Prescott or a Ghostface themed map in DBD, i will gladly take Ghostface as long as he isn't trash.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I don't see how you can counter Adrenaline. They get a quick 150% speed and a health state. I'm not saying it's OP, but it's powerful.
---
There isn't a counter to MoM, because the counter is to just hit them again. As I said, this isn't really a huge issue if it's only one person able to use it, as it's essentially a wasted perk after you hit them again. As well as this, multiple killers make this a wasted perk slot.
---
&gt;The atmosphere is the same color
---
Mostly that. It feels the same as mother's dwelling. I like the temple part, but most of my time on the map is spent in places that look the same as mother's dwelling. I've never criticised the devs for it and I'm certainly not mad, just would be nice to have a map that felt new, instead of a rehash of an old map with a new feature.
---
Haha Papa Bruce, I love it, and thank you!
---
This has nothing to do with Dead By Daylight.
---
I been looking forward to another event to grind skins on
---
That's why I've become a gen jockey. I see someone get injured? Good. They're wasting the killer's time.
---
Usually if I hook someone as killer and then go two feet and immediately some clown comes up for the unhook, I purposefully down the farmed then tunnel the farmer until they're hooked. Don't need that kind of shit in this game.
---
I teabagged a Nea when she came running up to me. I didn't see the doctor in the distance. He saw me. I got camped and "deserved it for teabagging."
---
..
---
No regrets.
---
What do you mean with the coutes? He pays for them
---
Her corrupt purge is more punishing for everyone than being a one hit down from her basic attack.
---
Killing an overpowered crutch perk? oh the horror 
---
/s
---
That *No Mames* shirt tho lol
---
What about sydney?!
---
Thank you, I appreciate it!
---
Removed for unrelated to dead by daylight
---
MoM is a bit too strong, especially if you can play it with Adrenaline. One or the other would be ok with me. DS is great now, even as killer I’m ok with it.

It’s also more possible, let’s be honest. There’s more of a possibility of Ghostface’s license holders going ‘go on, then’ than Michael’s.
---
yes, i want ghost face money
---
Evan didn't abandon his father, the Entity kidnapped him after he trapped all the workers in the mine.
---
With Evan trapped in the Entity's Realm there was nobody to take care of the old, sick, and insanely paranoid man so he probaboh starved to death in his own room because he was too weak or too afraid to try and get help.
---
I think one of the reasons Evan has so many scars and pieces of metal shoved into him is because he used to be furious at the Entity for taking him away from his father. Evan took care of him for years, he'd know better than anyone that his father needed someone to watch and take care of him to survive.
---
By kidnapping him, the Entity basically murdered his father and he's aware of that.
---
This was literally posted like 3 days ago. At least wait a couple of weeks.
---
Why is killing a character an acceptable answer though? People called Freddy OP. Lo and behold, it's taken over a year for them to (hopefully) rescue him from what many see as trash tier.
---
Let's maybe make perks have a fair use, rather than destroy them.
---
for the love of god look behind you!!! 
---
but yeah as others have said you want to try to save the pallets until absolutely necessary. time is the most important thing for both killers and survivors. a well timed pallet drop can waste the killers time while giving team mates more time to finish gens
---
I never realised watching people never look behind themselves game me so much anxiety
---
As someone else said in another thread,
---
We just got:
---
+ 3 original killers, survivors maps(kinda)
---
+ an entire endgame rework including hatch closing and DS rework.
---
+ motherfucking Ash Williams.
---
+ numerous cosmetics
---
on top of that they're currently working on,
---
+ Freddy rework
---
+ Dedicated servers
---
+ GF 
---
+ Potential Map overhauls and reworks
---
+ optimization
---
+ DBD mobile
---
I'm pretty sure they've given us enough stuff over the previous few months to justify one chapter with no survivor or Map. But that's just me.
---
Can't you make the text readable?
---
Oh, special edition also gave you 80s suitcase. Thanks for the help!
---
The shroud is the only secret offering that’s not a mori, and it’s not a very good offering, so maybe they thought you had a mori so they dc’ed
---
Just look to the original series. Sure, he almost always wears the sweater (par New Nightmare, but even then he still has one)- but there are variations. Original Freddy has purely red sleeves. Then there’s part 3’s syringe fingers Freddy. Again, New Nightmare Freddy has an overcoat and the rest of it. There are plenty of options to choose from.
---
Haven't heard anything like that. So it'll either be a surprise or won't happen
---
Basically when a survivor willingly drops and sacrifices their item in front of the killer. Some people let you escape or make a temporary truce for that.
---
The wording is a bit strange, but it doesn’t mean that you won 19% of your chases.  All it’s doing is laying out all of the events that affect your score in that category and telling you how much percent towards the emblems you gained for it.  
---
So when it said “Chases Won: 19%” it means you got 19% progress towards your emblem from your chases won.
---
Jeff aint exactly string cheese, also Clown.
---
Yea, I didn’t notice that. It’s says invisibility but I’m 100% sure I killed my creation
---
[Have this and many more](https://imgur.com/a/fx4xols)
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Also, if you buy the game during the sale you get a free copy to give to someone!
---
And if you already own the game you get 2 copies to give to friends for free
---
This trailer actually got me interested in picking up the game. I was surprised to find that the game was still getting new characters and major content additions after being around for 3 years and so it made me feel like it could be worth getting into.
---
Then I found that it's available on Xbox Game Pass and so there's really no reason at all for me to not start playing it. I played both tutorials this morning as well as a couple of matches. I don't completely know what I'm doing yet in terms of ideal tactics and strategy but I'm going to keep practicing.
---
Not gonna lie, he had us there until the endgame.
---
DG and DBD are 2 different teams at BHVR so deathgardens failure would have had no impact
---
stand behind someone when they are cleansing your haunted ground. any survivor will keep working on a active totem, especially if you don't hit them. it's perfect when they have that feeling of pride, then confusion, then the dead sea's entire salt content.
---
just because someone watches jojo, doesn't mean they don't contribute to society. it's a good show to watch.
---
Ok cool, and are these usually pretty substantial?
---
MoM pretty much procs with 1-0 gens done anyway due to the activation requirements, so the no healing is not as much as an advantage as you think it is.
---
Ah right, i did see the clown got some new cosmetics and i wondered if a whole patch had gone out. Thanks for the reply :)
---
GODDAMIT I JUST WANT A SCHOOL INTERIOR MAP
---
this rin is so scary omg :(
---
Well, to be, fair him not having his Boomstick and chainsaw makes perfect sense- kinda takes a lot of the tension out when you can just shoot the killer in the face and begin tearing them to shreds.
---
Burger price for a game... Sounds easy
---
Depends on what you consider substantial. Sometimes there’s a character rework
---
Who doesn’t love a good meme?
---
Well... yep.
---
R.I.P. Cashier.
---
I’m still yet to level up literally any of my killers for the TP’s. But I’m excited to see what perks GF comes with.
---
Lore
---
Damn, apparently i like the killers who everybody hates haha
---
Sad to admit this is basically me IRL.
---
Yep, whenever survivors do this I just assume they know what they're doing to the UI and play accordingly. Even better if they all dress the same too and then complain about tunneling post-game.
---
this is how it feels when you miss a skillcheck
---
Unpopular opinion but I don't think it is OP honestly. It's a gamble to run due to the fact that instadown killers can bypass it, but even if you've already taken your 3 hits necessary for it to activate, instadown perks like noed and make your choice still bypass it, which could make it a wasted perk slot. It's also the fact that it helps less skilled players out more when compared to the more skilled players. In many circumstances, MoM activates after being hooked at least once, maybe twice, which means it's a last chance. Skilled survivors running this perk will either use it to taunt you at the exit gate or run back into the trial to help someone, they don't really need it, it's overkill for them (if it gets use).
---
I really want to play as him. :(
---
Take the concept of Friday and make generic killers and survivors, like what DbD started with. Have more maps, and more options to fight with, and you have a golden game.
---
We just got ash not so long ago
---
No, it was an animated cashier that died.
---
You can but it goes on sale later today.
---
\*Cries In Doctor\*
---
Take my upvote good sir
---
Thats a shit excuse. If you fail your main objective then why should survivors be punished for it without you even using up a perk slot? "IT WOulD teAcH tHEm tO Do TOteMs"
---
Dude do you even listen to yourself? Maybe play a bit survivor so you know our struggle these days....
---
"Waht? Poeple dont do totemz? Letz maek killer OP now lol"
---
I say that on a main survivor perspective. Dropping all the pallets isn't a skill
---
E
---
If he can hit awake survivors, that would be extremely OP unless they made him visible at all times, which would mean his power would have to be something entirely different than what it is now and he then wouldn’t really be Freddy anymore.
---
My unpopular opinion is that Freddy is actually a strong killer.
---
Same! He was only on screen for a few mins but he had so much character and personality. Really loved that he was just an 'every-man' a regular Joe. PUT HIM IN THE GAME!
---
This argument (because you don't want a discussion and I know it) could go on for ages so we can stop here.
---
I mean this is literally Quentin's default outfit that you posted. 🤔 But yeah I think Quentin and especially Freddy could do with some cosmetics.
---
Just wanted to say that I am experienced with the game. I didnt want to brag lol.
---
And yea, it kinda works against calm spirit. But like I said, these are just suggestions out of my head. I am not saying that this unique ability perfectly works
---
the fuck you mean "buys" he payed for it fair and square.
---
PLEASE GIVE US CASHIER GUY!!!!!
---
You catch a keyboard one bad day?
---
This is a really cool theory and I personally find it interesting, but some of these deaths can't work.
---
The Huntress one doesn't work. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster occurred in 1986, while WW1 began in 1914. She'd probably have died of old age before the nuclear disaster happened. If you want her to fit your theory she'd need to die in some other way. It's pretty lame given that she'd singlehandedly murdered multiple platoons of invading German soldiers, but as a suggestion she could have died from a household accident or an illness that she couldn't treat.
---
The Freddy one also doesn't work. His lore describes in detail how he entered the Entity's Realm and the events leading up to it. It also ignores the twist at the end of his movie where he appears and murders Nancy's mother. Unless you retcon the film's ending as well as the character's lore Freddy doesn't work.
---
Finally I feel compelled to mention that I'm fairly sure Leatherface and the Hag aren't connected. All of Leatherface's relatives are male (at least in the first film) while Hag's story prominently features a Granma as a member of the cannibal tribe.
---
I like your theories, but I personally think the Entity just grabs people that it wants regardless of whether they're alive or dead.
---
Ash vs Evil Dead (by daylight)
---
That makes sense thank you.
---
stab
---
Hopefully and I and of wish he was a bit more of a douchebag like in the movies in my opinion
---
Self care is so bad it’s kinda sad. I guess it’s only good in low ranks so you don’t have to rely on your brain dead teammates, but in high ranks it’s just a waste of time. I’d only actively try to find someone to heal me against spirit and huntress.
---
Not hard though, bbq is always the option
---
No problem!
---
Would LOVE this map and also cashier boi. Please devs!!!!!!!
---
Honestly, I think the CORE design of F13 is WAY better then DBD, but the execution of the game was bad. I have 160 hours in F13 and 1200 in DBD, and I had way more fun in F13 then I ever had in DBD.
---
In F13 the killer was a threat. If he caught you once you were dead. This made the killer feel powerful when you played him and make him feel threatening when you played against him.
---
The multitude of ways you could escape in F13 was a great idea. You have so many options as a survivor in F13. You are given multiple ways of escaping, you can decide which one you want to work towards, which ones to abandon etc.
---
As the survivors it was optional if you wanted to work together. Since many escape routes have limited spaces it created conflict between the survivors aswell. There is a benefir to working together, but it's not obviously the best way.
---
The killer got more and more powerful as the game went on, creating a sense of urgency for the survivors.
---
Meanwhile in DBD you have no options. You better do those generators or you will lose. Does the killer in DBD feel scary or threatening? Not at all. You need to get caught 3 times and even then it's not the killer that "kills" you. Is there a sense of urgency? Not at all. Feel free to just hide all game. In the end the game gives you a hatch no matter how useless you were to escape.
---
The only thing that is good about DBD is it's design direction(very cool looking killers and a good idea for the world), and a very engaging almost never ending impactful progression system(there are allways more perks to unlock that allow for fun unique ways to tailor your playstyle). Apart from that, DBD is such a shit game compared to F13 design wise. Execution wise F13 flopped hard, and I'm not gona say DBD is executed well. Infact the development progression speed is a joke in the industry, but the game has 0 competitors, so anyone who likes multiplayer assymetric horror games are pretty much forced to play this game that is just about to start to feel like an acceptable game after 3 years post launch.
---
Its times like these when I wish the killer could decide to lift people off the hook themself.
---
False. Look at the bill dlc, they clearly refer to it as a paragraph. Might want to use that brain of yours before you hit send
---
If anyone is curious, the speedpaint of this was just uploaded at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KitGhcienGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KitGhcienGo)
---
Adding onto the advice here- I spend a lot of time watching DBD videos on YouTube to try and get better, and I highly recommend watching HybridPanda's gameplay videos if you really want to improve your gameplay skills. He doesn't do tutorials but he plays full on games and you get to get a sense of how to be effective as a killer/survivor and you can see what the best techniques are to win at the game.
---
I also like The King in terms of one-off "tips" videos.
---
Lol yeah. Its fine as it is, like... just hide or go one way, then turn around after the 4 seconds
---
Pig=upvote
---
BL is highly dependent on map. Most maps have limited use for BL and one map literally has no spot for BL to activate. DH can be used anywhere.
---
BJVR once said they never want anyone to be in a scenario with a 100% lose rate.
---
That is a 100% lose rate, unless the killer has the brain of a rat
---
Yeah, was playing survivor the other day and a guy got downed and hooked while the Legion had NOED active and he was hooked right next to an open gate. And by time it happened the collapse timer was low so looking for the totem was a no go and Legion face camped him so we couldn't do anything but we tried and failed so we left.
---
Little old survivor cursed out me, my friend, and the other random for quite awhile for not saving him somehow
---
I saw a comment from some guy somewhere on Reddit that read "Ghostface is my favorite slasher franchise but since it's only a paragraph I'm not going to buy it." The guy got downvoted to shit and a bunch people pointed out that "you're not going to support your favorite franchise just because it didn't come with a map and a Survivor reskin who'd probably have some low-tier perks?"
---
Welcome! Stay frosty and have fun! :D
---
Looks amazingly spooky. I love it. Keep it up!
---
Of course you do lol.
---
Lets be real now. You just want killers to be OP hahaha. You dont really give a shit if survivors do totems or not because you never play survivor and dont know at all how it is to be a survivor (ESPECIALLY a solo survivor. You just cant get the 4K and now want killers to be much stronger lmao.
---
Talk about a straw man
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Bruh. keep your text in a frame.
---
Exactly this, I'm buying the second it releases because i've been happy with the other DLC and want to support BHVR. After everything we've gotten lately i can handle not getting a new map or survivor.
---
Sry
---
I spent 80% of my playtime on survivor, especially solo survivor
---
Michael Myers would like to have a word with you and who ever think Ghostface is the icon on Halloween. But I do agree that the Ghostface costume was very popular when the first movie came out.
---
wait but there are ways to force end a match... Im amazed people arent abusing this yet to just get 30k bp for no work
---
MoM helps with this also... its helped me save people from being camped I can go in and take extra hits!!
---
Both no and yes.
---
No they way it works is fine exposed and 2/3/4% movement speed boost.
---
yes: the big problem is survivors don't know if the killer has noed or not. which makes survivors ignore totems. Ohtofu explains this in depth. the amount of time needed for a generator to be done is 80 secs, totems need 12 secs to break you which means all 5 would take 60 secs almost a full gen not to mention all the time you spend looking for them. but last but not least if the killer didnt have noed congragulations you wasted a lot of time. 
---
if survivors got a warning the killer has noed at the start of the trial surviors would go out of their way to cleanse totems. 
---
which A. slows the game down and B. gives noad a reliable position of power.
---
it's a bright text on a bright background. it hurts my eyes more than it's readable
---
I feel the sarcasm radiating through this comment.. lmaooooo
---
I think the match has to start first.  Only way I know how to get that to work is for the killer to DC
---
Officer Dewey &gt;
---
I can't see the original post. Did you maybe word something in a weird or condescending way?
---
Not relatable but I thought this is loss at first
---
I never liked having to pay for killers and survivors anyways, but at least it felt like a supporting the devs kinda thing. Them making you play the game non stop just makes people take bigger leaves from the game as in, "I've already missed most of the battle pass so what's the point?"
---
They can. They're just bad ones.
---
He is a competetive person,if you havent realized yet. I still don't get these memes ,when they are far worse streamers out there. Mainly survivor mains .
---
Her leaked cosmetics show a very Hoffman inspired design, with the coat and all. And I suppose the reason we haven’t received one that transforms her into Jigsaw himself is because he’s completely against killing (even watching Dead Meat will tell you that), so just plopping people onto hooks for them to die would be completely out of order for him. That, and he’s a 70 year old man.
---
I assumed they would have pulled resources and reinvested them into DBD.
---
Exactly. MoM HAS use. It's just that people only use it for a free extra hit, which is stupid.
---
Which is probably why the outfit is completely different.
---
I made and posted this meme literally 4 minutes after the release of the trailer. It was before the actual trailer had even been posted on the reddit. I wanted to give people a chance to actually see it first :/
---
This re-work and free to play weekend goes live at 6pm UK time. Quite hyped to be fair !
---
[Nah, this right here is what we need](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bp9n9k/im_uninstalling_if_there_wont_be_this_skin/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Instadown stuff is a counter for it, but apparently that isnt enough for killers, because they want the kills. I agree with you, it isnt OP.
---
HOW COULD YOU NOT!!!
---
HITS MEAN YOU LOSE YOUR LIFE AND IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME YOU DIE FOR REAL, MAN!!!
---
I definitely think he’s one of the better streamers, but that doesn’t mean he’s perfect. 
---
It always seems like he downplays the skill of survivors to pure luck, their perks/items, or him messing up.
---
I mean I only started during the free month on PS+ but considering the game is only three years old, yes the dark ages only did take months may be a year at most. What your talking about are design flaws, not programming flaws (except the bugged perks obviously.) They were balance flaws which does take time to sort out, because there aren't easy solutions especially not in an assymetrica horror game.
---
Also, dude's funny. |'ve never seen him laugh either.
---
Even better when paired with thanataphobia, but honestly stacking both effectiveness addons or just being able to aim her vomit good enough is better than using the corrupted pools
---
Damn this looks fucking amazing.
---
Daaaaaaaaaaamn!
---
Since it hasn't been mentioned yet, and even as a longtime player my dumb ass still forgot about this recently (even though it's really obvious), you can level up another character's bloodweb using bloodpoints earned from games as a separate character, since BP is collective across your entire account. So you can keep playing as Claudette or Trapper or whoever to gain BP, and then spend that BP leveling Nea to eventually get the teachable Balanced Landing
---
now all we need is jason and the slash street boys will be in dead by daylight....
---
You said everything I need. As someone who recently redownloaded F13; I can agree it’s hella fun. But between squeekers and counselors killing each other I can’t play for more than an hour.
---
Yes and no but you can see the similarity
---
Holy crap you cut it close.
---
Nope, death garden team is still going at their own game and trying to revive it
---
Never seen that one before!
---
I loved F13 a lot but it just unacceptable that every single patch would always add in more glitches and bugs. And even the ones that were fixed ended up back in the game eventually. I cannot believe they are still dealing with roof glitchers for instance, that was a huge problem around launch that was eventually fixed for a while but apparently it’s just super common again.
---
Such a disappointment for an extremely fun game. One of my favorite uses of voice chat in a recent game, met a lot of really fun people through F13.
---
lol what the fuck is that build. Ebony mori aside that perk build is potato tier and does not come close to what a semi competent hag would run.
---
A broken and jagged baton from her track days
---
Yeah it is, when the protection hit change comes, then it'll be good.
---
This doesn't even seem like it's related to scream at all except for the mask at the point. The costume is... different, and they're just using the name ghost face. They haven't mentioned scream to any degree and his backstory is incongruous with any of the scream killers.
---
amanda and michael are a definite ship.
---
*stands over it and gets ready to close it the minute that one dies*
---
As lonh as it's not priced the same as a new chapter with a killer/survivor is, I'll be perfectly happy with it
---
Especially with the leak making him seem like he's just 2 other killers mashed together.
---
feelsbadman Game could have been amazing. Had a very good core concept. I heard that the new Predator game will be from this dev team aswell. Let's hope they can deliver with that one.
---
I assume he's just play testing everything to make sure it works, as I would imagine. Usually what QA would do.
---
The hatch only spawns when the number of generators completed are the number of survivors left+1, unless you're the only survivor left, which then it will always spawn. Hatch always opens when you're the last survivor left, but the killer can close it. Keys open an unopened hatch, wether just spawned or closed by the killer.
---
Or when you see a 3-4 person SWF squad join
---
Hex: Herobrine
---
It's cool. Glad for the clarification.
---
yeah but map would have been cool
---
Try to learn to loop him.
---
The biggest surprise would be a mobile port that doesn’t suck ass
---
Personally I care about a survivor because unlike other horror series like Friday the 13th, Scream actually has a consistent, well written protagonist who is just as important to the character of Ghost Face as the people under the mask.
---
Ha, give me a break. Any good survivor wants you to see their aura. Especially as an M1 killer. 
---
It’s clear you don’t play killer at a high level and don’t understand the frustration on that side. If you played Wraith in red ranks and get hit with the 4 man MoM/Adrenaline you will understand the frustration. One or the other is ok, not both. 
---
Thankfully everyone plays Billy to counter this and makes the game super fun.
---
Ya, his design could be by Behaviour. Not bad but looks somewhat assassin creedish.
---
This is a no for me.. basically you are punishing survivors for using a perk that was given to them... just stop...  
---
You want the egc timer to be even shorter?  I'm so confused... 
---
Just practice at killer and get skill instead of trying to nerf survivors every which way possible!
---
Well I never go to Red ranks because game isn't fun anymore once you get there
---
well he died in it thats probably why isnt the game and besides what perks would they give him?
---
At rank one everyone is so sweaty it's awful
---
Nah some of them really wanted a full chapter with map and survior and I am like it probably must've cost them a lot to bring  Ghostface in, stop crying we have one of the most requested killer by the community.
---
People will be happy when he comes and forget about there are some who will bitch no matter what tho
---
But it isn't - the beanie in game is grey, this one is blue.
---
The shirt is totally different, here its a Joy Division shirt and ingame he has a black and blue tree pattern. He also has a denim jacket ingame and in the picture he has a blue hoodie with a backpack.
---
So its literally totally different. Maybe the colour scheme is the same, which is why it looks similar.
---
When you hear his lullaby hide (not in locker). When he finds you run to a pallet, sprint burst compleatly detooths him. It takes 7.10 seconds for him to sleep you and thats plenty of time to get away. Good freddys will use invisibility in the dream transition to mindgame you however your unlikely to see that in lower ranks.
---
But he’s faster so what do I do then? Even if I try to use balanced landing he eventually catches up
---
No problem, I'ma be using the hell out of these!
---
Present. Though I ain't touching Freddy until the MoM rework. Plague temporarily until then. 
---
It's not even optimal to tunnel someone off hook as Freddy if you catch the saving survivor in the act. Tag both, the one that was unhooked will be in a panic to get somewhere safe since they know you'll see their aura even if you don't tunnel, and then just target the saving survivor since they often act with complete abandon cuz they figure the Freddy will go for their teammate. 
---
That's how I play anyway.
---
Yes it could be slight narcissism. I noticed he used to only reply to comments he thought were insulting him (happened to me once trying to make a joke and he thought I called him pay2win LOL) 
---
I have a grandparent with it and I noticed it in Monto so I stopped watching. Not that he’s bad or anything just my preference. I’m glad I’m not the only to notice it lol.
---
I personally don't rely on traps - I just make use of her crouching. Sneaking up on survivors is my thing!
---
Dead By Daylight as a whole involves understanding the inevitability of the killer catching up. You want to try to stall him by looping for as long as you can, and get your friends to do gens.
---
BPS for a killer is just pudding anyway.
---
They should make it so everytime a survivor falls a sleep, they then fall asleep faster each time, and after 4 or 5 times they can not wake up or they gradually fall asleep on their own.
---
That would be the first cosmetic item I’d actually pay money for
---
What part is the stand no mither from? Is it kira's 4th power?
---
I'd pick ash still, he's better for the game because it brings in his fans and I bet there are people that agree
---
Yeah but ebony Moris are an ultra rare addon that can only be used once and most meta killer perks are easily counterable.
---
That can happen if a counselor steps in a bear trap another survivor set up. Or getting hit by a car. Sometimes they jump in front or freak out when Jason shows up
---
Why can I hear the Michael Myers tier 3 music when he opens the door
---
Just a reminder that the Doctor got his black clothing and super sparky cosmetics after BHVR reworked him, so we might be getting something simpl-ish for freddy and quentin too, I really doubt adding these cosmetics is the big surprise they're preparing for us. Probably an event like Hallowed blight and etc with lots of bits of lore, or its gonna have something to do with DbD youtubers, tournaments, etc.
---
Great work OP!
---
White text on a white board. 11/10 design
---
Which kinda suits him given his game play style.
---
Ctrl+Alt+Del this.
---
If you had seen some of the videos of him playing killer regularly, on his streams for example, it's most likely not for playtesting and just for fun. It's pretty apparent that he's a very bad killer, I remember seeing him trying to M1 someone who was right in front of him and missed multiple times when there was no way he could miss, not sure if the rush was getting to him and he was panicking but my god... That was painful.
---
She was the first killer I ever chose and I chose her because she looked the scariest (out of her and the original three). I feel like a nurse hipster because I played her for different reasons than everyone else :p
---
Googoo gaga

well its just i feel  like the reasoning behind why they arent is because they only got thet license from fun world not the people who made the scream movies. and i would prefer a new killer because a new power could have a lot of potencial for killers similar to spirit, billy and nurse they have the power you can do the most with and thats what i love the most about this game other than perks/music

Ok thanks for the help👍🏼

_t bags on the hatch as last player gets tossed on hook_

I played that game for like an hour and hated it. The survivors couldnt run and were tripping over nothing.. the killer teleports and knows where you are at all times..  
---
DBD should have an option to play like that but with good perks and no teleporting lmaooooo.. the concept was cool.
---
Dude. Chill. God damn...
---
It's in a basement...
---
I have forbidden knowledge and I can 100% tell you that yes, Reboot Jason is a separate license

Don't really see the issue honestly, so long as the survivors aren't potatoes and respect bbq you can't pull any LONG range insta-downs and hatchet-&gt;melee is already quick enough to kinda be considered an insta-down. Not to mention she is 110% movement speed, gets progressively more cucked with each new map and loses out on all the other addons she could be bringing instead. Besides ultra-rare, supposed to be strong af, thats why they ULTRA-RARE. They can remove iri hatchets when they make her base 115% movement speed and fix all the janky hitboxes in this game, till then they're fine.
---
His rework is coming out soon so he’ll probably need a whole host of new counters but for now stall him/hide and you should be good!
---
It wasnt, I checked basement and it was somewhere else
---
When I was a kid my brother chased me around with that thing on and scared the shit out of me. He trapped me in the bathroom with full ghostface getup. Scared me so bad.
---
Basement chest boe
---
Amazing. I'm an Ash and Michael main so to me, Ash is definitely at the forefront (only survivor) but I also see as Michael being at the forefront too.
---
I can't speak for everyone, but I don't find him hot either. I just think his character lore and design is cool.
---
Plus hardly anyone played Quentin when I started the game, and I knew I wanted to prestige someone "rare". I literally go months of playing this game before I get lobbied with another P3 Quentin.
---
Really? That's fucking weird lmao
---
Josephuu
---
Freddy can read your aura if you are asleep. Much like BBQ&amp;Chili, try to position so you are behind a generator to obscure yourself. Failing a generator or healing skill check will wake you up from the explosion/pain, giving you a chance to reposition without your aura being read.
---
I just hope we don't get "CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY AT 15FPS" I mean when Scott and JenDenise made the joke, it made me laugh. But when many more people carried that on, it started to get a little irritating.
---
Exactly. Not to mention, every Ghostface we ever got was linked to Sidney, so it feels weird that we only get the killer.
---
I've been playing for over two years and I only learned a few months ago that crouching prevents hag traps. I still feel like an idiot.
---
Damn ur dumb..
---
I want survivor and map because the game is really lacking content for me rn. Ive done everything to do
---
And you can't say this is rank reset or low ranks, the killer was legit rank 2
---
Tbh I'd buy that.
---
I have trauma from attempting to use that add on, don’t even get me started. Every time I’ve tried to use it my Obsession has been some ultra immersed P3 Claudette who immediately wakes up and then disappears into the ether, never to be seen again. You get more utility from Freddy’s brown add ons than that garbage.
---
Bill and Amanda died in their respective Franchises yet their  in the game and it’s proven in the lore the entity can save those from death.
---
Well done. 👍
---
Riiiight
---
Search Mc_ote and LMclean on Twitch. They both stream DBD weekly and answer any questions you might have. Mathieu is definitely a potato when it comes to killer.
---
I´d love that since I use adrenaline
---
Agreed.
---
I’m so sorry, that sounds like a nightmare
---
No u
---
Both are toxic, nobody is under any false pretences about that.
---
It's just that getting mad about it is silly.
---
9 killers
---
10 survivors
---
3 cosmetic packs
---
10 frames per second
---
Honestly, it's not even funny. Like, you just know when someone drops you by the hatch it's only to close it so they can have their min of glory.
---
Not every killer had a insta down so what do they do? Just say fuck you deal with it?

Agreed! I think the spirit is the scariest to fight gameplay wise, but visually....
---
I just searched it up; the trenchcoat one looks really cool - that would look great.
---
Oh my god, I don’t like the combination. That sounds awful
---
d e s c e n d
---
Watching several streamers/youtubers is actually really useful for a game like this. Say what you will about any of them, but all the popular ones have different enough playstyles and approaches that I think you could learn a lot from all of them.
---
I personally watched several of them for months before getting the game and it really helped me skyrocket out of low ranks and start off decent at the game. HybridPanda who was mentioned and Monto I feel are the better ones for beginning since they both upload frequently and always try unique builds along with explaining the reason/use of the perks and what they're trying to do with them, people get annoyed with Monto for it but he always spends like the first minute of the video explaining what each perk, item, and add-on does.
---
just look for the rest, I can name them all but a lot of them don't have the best reputation among people here sadly, and I don't want to start an outcry of how they act, but they are all worth watching imo if you want to pick up how/why they do things to help you play better.
---
Agreed theres been so many times that I don't even get to use it because I was always healed between each attack. Or I use it to taunt killers at the exit gate...  but when it comes in handy is when I gotta make clutch saves because killer wants to camp and secure a kill... 
---
It's fun trying to make Billy's r1 you tho so you can activate it.
---
I honestly I don’t know and I’m not gonna say it’s an easy fix because I’m not a game Designer
---
&gt;but only after it was overwhelmingly rejected when they surveyed players.
---
Did they release the survey results? Where are you getting that info from?
---
Oh dear haha! He did only manage to kill one of us, and we managed to get the final survivor off the hook at the end whilst getting chased we got out fine and stunned him with pallets! I’ve not actually watched him play! Maybe I should ;3
---
The survivors do things 50% slower while asleep. You know their location while they sleep. So having all 4 survivors asleep is a very good thing. Combine it with Green Dress so they have way fewer skill checks, Pill Bottle if you wanna remove the lack of a mind game and get an easy first hit, Red Paint Brush if you are good with the 7 second mind game and want max auras, or Nancy's Masterpiece so you can start sleeping survivors from 24 meters away. Sure the 9 seconds is rough sometimes, ESPECIALLY the endgame, but with all the information and every survivor doing things 50% slower, you more than likely won't reach endgame because it now takes 120 seconds to do a gen, and they lose 10% waking themselves up, and reveal their location, which allows you to sleep them again and see EVERYONE'S auras. 
---
Blocks ARE good, but they are only his best option in Endgame Freddy. Overcharge / Huntress Lullaby Freddy is the only other style that you can say it may be his best option, but even then, it competes with Green Dress + Swing Chains / Jump Rope. And yes, Class Photo is still good for Overcharge Freddy, even if it is one of two Freddy styles you can say it isn't his best in. Even in Black Box tunnelling Freddy, seeing the auras of all survivors upon sleeping someone allows you to force them to have a 75% action speed penalty.
---
If you want my tier list for his add-ons, it goes
---
* Class Photo
---
* Range
---
* Skill Check decrease
---
* Pill Bottle
---
* Blocks / Red Paint Brush
---
* Action Speed Penalty
---
* Speed
---
* Black Box
---
Killer used Cut Coin, I guess the solution is not spawning less chests but let them spawn under the ground. but idk
---
This made me feel sad for the Trapper. The idea that he has fought the Entity for so long to try and get out, then mutilated and hurt for him not to leave sounds like something the Entity would do for sure.
---
It's not finalized and MoM is too good at the moment.
---
I just wanna see him crawl up someone's nose.
---
Ever since I started playing this game, I immediately wanted Ghost face to be added. I wish they were adding things actually related to Scream with either maps or survivors, but them adding the Ghost Face killer is satisfactory enough for me
---
For the love all of things scientific, THAT IS NOT HOW BRAINS DEVELOP. Sweet jesus, socially inept? Maybe but you would be too if you lived near your entire life alone surviving in a forest. Mind of a child? NO, a child doesn't successfully hunt and kill entire groups of soldiers in ww1, a child doesn't build all of their tools and learn to hunt with extreme precision.  Please before you start spouting bullshit you heard somewhere else at least think about what your spouting logically.
---
i LOVE speed paints, thanks for linking!! i'll be checking this out after work for sure.
---
Use Noed, use make your choice, play Instadown killers... or yeah, fuck you just deal with it 😝. No, but really... its not OP, no m1 killers may be able to down them, but don't you think that was their intention? They added the perk in the first place... they made it work the way it does... its supposed to work against M1 killers and not instadown stuff....
---
Just make sure you’re always doing something if your not being chased.
---
Nothing more frustrating than taking a 2/3 minute chase to only have 1 gen pop.
---
This combined 2 perks are the only realistic way to be able to get out your teammates, and yourself, from the basement (which is not an uncommon situation). 
---
The process consists on you unhooking and giving BT to your teammates (or teammate), so they can leave with any kind of hit (chainsaw, NOED, or whatever); after that, you get into a locker, and when the killer (who knows you're still down there), comes to your locker, you stun him and run out. It's not easy, but it works and is satisfying af if performed well.
---
Seems like the community is displeased with my suggestion. It may look like I wanted to nerf survivors or killers. My original intent was that killers could have a security against eventual toxic gameplay, and that survivors that believe NOED is unfair and irritable no longer have to deal with it (From my experience, people are getting pretty salty in post-game chat). I can see that this suggestion for a rework has lots of flaws and I am convinced, that if any rework should take place, this is not an ideal option. Perhaps it's even as good as it could be. Thanks for your constructive feedback, everybody.
---
that's an Ash cosmetic, linking back to the original media he's from, Ash Vs. Evil Dead.
---
Spawns work completely different my dude. There is always a survivor near to you ;)

---
I actually love the attention to detail on putting the Nurse and Doctor heads in the right places.
---
i personally prefer a new killer to map/survivor because the killers power matters a hell of lot more to me than those other two because i see more potencial in it.
---
Well this should increase that player base. Even if its temporary.   Glad to hear more people will have access to it.
---
Maybe they couldn't get the rights to it? I've read somewhere that there is some copyright trouble with that franchise right now, simmilar to Jason's franchise.
---
^ found the person that wants to sleep with the real version instead of a body pillow.
---
Introducing:
---
the ghostface sentence.
---
i agree with your meme
---
Totally, I’m not mad, just a lot of people are complaining why its not a chapter. I would of loved a scream chapter, but in reality this is not a scream paragraph. It’s ghost face paragraph.
---
I love this so much. Ofc I would like to see a new map but what people usually say? "STOP MAKING NEW KILLERS AND FIX EVERYTHING STUPID DEVS!!!1". So they only made a new killer, reworked Freddy, they are planning on reworking maps, fixed hatch standoffs issues with really cool EGC but ppl are now complaing the chapter misses something. like what the actual fck?
---
Damn, wasn't able to see it in time. What did it say?
---
I don't!...only because they expect that. I run it on Quentin.
---
Near is a very widely defined term. There will never be a survivor that spawns nearer than a tile away my dude.
---
I like when survivors put their twitch stream in their name and then after the game they say "why are you stream sniping" when you aren't stream sniping they are just trash.
---
I agree on this 150%
---
It doesn’t block them but BHVR stayed somewhere that if people get an obscene number of reports it DOES actually affect them and can result in a ban on console now. Something we didn’t previously have.
---
Oh I’m aware it’s not a Scream chapter, it’s still disappointing tho.
---
I like tru3, but I was playing solo survivor and we demolished him so much he camped the hook. He accused us of being SWF but there was only 2 people who were together.
---
Yeah, Ghostface literally wouldn’t exist if there was no Sidney.
---
AS A FREDDY MAIN I WILL ALSO ACCEPT THIS
---
Man I bet they regret using the term paragraph that one time because the community has made so many assumptions. 
---
Pretty sure they used it because LF was an added bonus between chapters, and not because it was a killer only.
---
Dropping someone on hatch and closing it = just as toxic as t-bagging at exit gates.
---
That’s not my own opinion before anyone says anything.
---
Hate it when that happens
---
Yes, you absolutely would.
---
Why is the cashiers body beefy asf but his face suggest chub?
---
Soon as a i see TTV or a 4 piece immediate pop. Im putting on a mori. Then i get my fries ready for the salt.
---
When was Ash called a paragraph? Link?
---
Gain...?
---
Then it should go both ways where you can see the killer's name like on ps4.
---
Look behind urself. Dont drop pallets instantly
---
I’m not seeing any release date on that post. Just the date of release for the Switch version of the game in September.
---
I care about maps because I like seeing new places to explore and hide.
---
Nah, it wasn't because of me. My boss pissed him off saying he wasn't allowed to go into a certain part of the office anymore because too many people had complained about him.
---
He flew into a rage and started pounding his keyboard, picked it up and started hitting shit with it. He was yelling "I don't give a fuck what's professional!" right at my female boss who was only 3 feet away. 
---
I had trouble with this guy, but after seeing how he treated my boss, and she let him walk all over her...yeah, I quit that week. I realized if she let him get away with treating her like that, none of my issues would ever be listened to. That guy was a nut.
---
LF wasn't a paragraph he was a word: BBQ
---
i personally prefer a new killer because a new power i think has a lot more potencial than what is pretty much a brand new character skin and new perks
---
Oh it was, the best part was that the Kate and Jake just spammed the unhook button until I died and didn’t even try to unhook me when there were two of them there to try AND I had decisive and MoM😭 I could’ve gotten out.
---
More then half the killers are M1 killers. It's a problem dude.
---
the salt is the best part
---
Haha Thank you!
---
yay finally someone who understands
---
I’d be ok with a NOED rework but this is not it.
---
I played it for a few hours and the interaction mechanics pissed me the fuck off every time. The one thing I did really really like tho was the chat functions where the killer could talk to you and hear the survivors talk and it’s all proximity chat, that was cool.
---
its not even deleted lol
---
Well yeah but that’s still only one time in 4 movies and not what he’s known to do
---
Except teabagging happens pretty much every game. Hatch carry and close is extremely rare.
---
i agree with you
---
So his accusation was correct then no? By your own account at least 2 of you were exploiting voice comms in a game design'd from the ground up to be played without communication. Don't get me wrong I don't really care too much for true but his complaint here is founded. Swf is busted in nearly every capacity.
---
it could've been there connection and hits weren't registering, i wouldn't get to upset about it, if anything there the bad ones for being rude.
---
you. basement not there ma boi
---
think again bud
---
Survivor turns arounds, presses 1 at Freddy, game ends and all survivors escape.
---
What was their ping? If they were actually Russian they probably had some dogshit ping.
---
I never said it happened more often , I said it was as toxic
---
Wtf.. did they edit it out? It did say June 18 on all platforms..
---
Found one
---
There will be a full chapter announced during the stream.
---
Hopefully. I mean, they Scream lisence is a bitch to aquire, since it's owned by like, 3 companies, I understand why they just got the ghostface mask from funworld.
---
From what we've seen so far, I'm wondering if he's a default 115% killer in the real world and can hit awake survivors, but can enter the dream world and become a souped-up version for as long as his ability lasts? Whatever the case, I'm super excited for the stream
---
Does anyone know if the Nintendo Switch version will allow us to link to our existing accounts?
---
Why would you get downvoted? I really hope *everyone* agrees with this
---
Yea dude, I will agree this is broken. Personally, I enjoy the harder pip system mainly because I don’t want to rank up. But for people actually trying to pip, it’s crazy hard.
---
I got a 21k/4K game earlier and got a safety pip. I pretty much stomped on the survivors and didn’t get a single pip.  That’s pretty nuts.
---
I never said the game didn’t have flaws, I was just saying that it’s unrealistic for a game to never have anything wrong with it.
---
Join the discord.
---
deathgarden is being relaunched tomorrow
---
I originally thought it was in the basement as others did, but looking closer, it almost seems as if it's right underneath the barrier. Wondering if this is a glitch caused by cut coin or something, as I run Plunderer's a lot and never saw that, or, at least, never noticed it if it did happen.
---
3 survivor in the game
---
1 infinite loading screen
---
I just want more free brown rarity cosmetics in general.
---
9 killers?  Does that mean included or that far fewer killers will be available on Switch than other platforms?
---
Lol i just camp, its far more efficient as they can't handle letting the killer get 1 kill out of 4.
---
I mean he’s got a good voice tho, so it would be dope to hear it. Even if it’s just his classic “do you like scary movies” or something. 
---
I’m also rewatching all of the movies, I’m really excited.
---
I know it won’t happen but i really wanted them to put Nancy in the game she’s one of the best final girls in all of the slasher genre I was low key mad when they chose to put Quentin in the game but I wouldn’t mind some cosmetics for him
---
#No.
---
ye ofc, I Run noed on Legion, big Boy.
---
And whats wrong with ruin? cant Hit greats/remember Totem Spots?
---
Patches &amp; updates =/= Chapters
---
Every chapter we've had has come with a map + survivor..
---
Hmh, good point.
---
He's pretty, and pretty groovy.
---
Seriously though, I love him and I'm so glad he's been added. Made me wanna [dance.](https://i.imgur.com/Hay3p6F.gif)
---
Cant win without assisted perks i see ^^
---
I kinda like being able to see their names. Some of these dudes have names that make me chuckle.
---
It's implied that Ash is a paragraph. Plague was chapter 11, and Ghostface is allegedly chapter 12. If they're calling Ash a chapter, they've severely ruined the system of chapters and paragraphs they had established originally.
---
I think there are some perks that can help you a lot, and they are useful most of the time against another killers
---
Sprint burst can help you outrun the freddy boi when he puts u in dream state
---
Spine chill can give u some time for predicting from where he comes and etc. (Like premonition, but I prefer Spine chill
---
Adrenaline is hella good in probably all the situations, I would say it is a S-tier perk
---
Oh I WAS civil in my first post, that was just me expressing my grave contempt to the idiots who believe in that dribble and laying some SCIENTIFIC FACTS out to support my claim. I stopped being civil when some little fuckstick decided to ignore my argument for seemingly no reason and decide to attack me personally claiming me to be a pedophile. See the difference now lad? One statement  is civil, one you can disagree with alebit incorrectly and the other is a baseless, derogative claim posted peerly out of spite in an attempt to discredit my previous claim. Perhaps instead of attacking someone with baseless accusations you can instead focus your vigor on dismantling the argument presented? Perhaps thats too much to expect from an inept child like yourself. See one only shows a curtsy back to the other when given.
---
I’m my opinion, bbq should either lose the effect, lose the blood point part, or wglf should gain a great effect. It’s not fair IMO bbq can be so amazing AND give double bp. WGLF is arguably harder to get stacks, AND there’s no effect other than BP
---
I'm saying this game had way more wrong with it than other games. But hey, it's pretty ok now. Took us 3 years to get here though.
---
This is something else hahahah
---
Better than never imo
---
Okay...    you show me where I call you a paedophile...    I’ll wait.
---
Haha yea and I kinda only just started playing with her 😅 thanks though. So you like her? I’m still on the fence. I only have her like level 19 not sure if I want to keep going, I need some input
---
*Im a little teapot short and stout*
---
*Here is my handle*

*Here is my spout*
---
*When I get all evil up*

*You will shout*
---
*Hook you up and pull your soul out!*
---
Michael's Tier 3 actually hurts this emblem a lot for him because of the instadown, which is quite lame. The current emblems are very counterintuitive, and negatively affect some killers more than others. I really wish they'd tweak it sooner rather than later.
---
Your not alone
---
Well said. However I believe the two main things that killed F13 are:
---
  
---
-The bugs. So many. Every damn patch. Insane bugs such as the fuse, a crucial object needed for an objective, getting stuck in the ground every match, a bug that was not fixed for 2 months. I made over 70 friends playing that game. With each "patch" 5 to 10 of them would just drop off because they had enough.  
---
    
---
-It was a nightmare for solo players because of how easy it was for a counselor to team up with Jason and cheat. Every other or third game. This was a huge oversight by the dev team. You cannot have that in this type of a game.
---
Just play the damn game.
---
Yeah tbf cant complain either it feels like it’s only been a few weeks since ash came out so it’s just kinda like a chapter extended over time, minus the map which isn’t the worst.
---
Ya Halloween 11 when Laurie and her friends go to the ski resort and Myers chases them through the mountains!!
---
but of course.
---
Tbh I usually start playing killer after I’ve seen my own randoms being toxic. 😂 it’s time to punish these fools! Congrats on that Merciless Victory!
---
Well, y'know Morty, I mean- if you wanna sell rope, you gotta- you gotta pump the gas a little!
---
Ah yes now a stawmen argument, I think i'm done here, you've proven time and time again your too childish to actual participate in a civil discussion. Maybe if you don't want people calling you out for your shit, don't go slinging it around in the first place, bye lad.
---
If you want to be technical it’s 3 words, unless you count &amp; as a symbol, then it’s 2 words.
---
Me forgetting that your own traps can stun you
---
Again. Start the civil conversation. Then I’ll probably take part in it.  Continue to be the biggest douche on Reddit. Then I have no reason too.
---
Thanks lol. It’s not everyday you see a rank 11 get a merciless victory with Nurse lol. Especially on console
---
If you say you don't want a grocery store map you lyin'.
---
Don't worry everyone here means well. I hope you enjoy your stay in the fog. Stay safe and remember! Death is not an escape!
---
I hear you! I’ve tried so hard to like her again. It’s just so hard to be precise. It takes a real level of skill to control her on controller ✊🏼
---
I've seen posts here and there complaining about it. Personally, I kinda wish we could get the shopping mall from the teaser as a map at some point, but they are already doing a lot right now so I am content.
---
*\*happy entity noises\**
---
no i think bbq and chili should stay the same wglf should just make a better way to get stacks like completing generators or something
---
*its
---
I also put my profile on private. It’s just dumb and asking people to literally come and cry on your page.  It’s like Yelp for steam, people are only gonna post shit when they are upset.
---
Goes invisible so you can barely see him further than 30m, he is faster when he is invis and there is no sound cue so he can wait for you without you hearing him
---
We honestly can't stop playing it. It's such a great game. I have no idea how I haven't given it a shot until recently.
---
yeah there is at least 7 counters to it now
---
But that still doesn’t change the fact that you’re wasting a slot just for bp. With barbecue you get stacks for doing your job, and on top of that an amazing effect.
---
ghostface is one of those guys that gave himself a nickname hahah
---
Not how it works. All Dead by Daylight looks for is if you own Deathgarden on Steam. Therefore, if you get the game refunded, it will remove itself from your Dead by Daylight cosmetics. A similar thing happened with Deathgarden's launch where people lost the mask if they hadn't bought the game after its initial free period.
---
BHVR have absolutely no control over whether or not you have the mask in DbD, short of giving you a key to redeem Deathgarden to give you the mask. They definitely can't take it away themselves unless they remove the mask from the game itself.
---
“I can’t use sole survivor with one person dead without getting closer!” “Oh then come as close as you’d like!”
---
We all know Monsterous Shrine OP af for killer it helps you out guys what a crutch perk. Useful in situations = Crutches 😡😤 I bet they use Dead Hard and Adrenaline, Decisive Strike and Self Care and Hope too OP might as well bring in a wheelchair because they ran out of crutch perks to use eskeetit ex dee 😂😂😂
---
Yeah I had a guy do this to me last night and I definitely felt some kinda way about it... but I mean, oh well, I just moved on to the next match. I usually picture those killers as 10 year olds with snot hanging from their nose and it gives me a good laugh anyway.
---
Same. And now I don't even regret it because they're giving us two free copies of the game for friends.
---
Man back to this comment. How cool would chucky be?! That would be super scary to me since I was a child and totally afraid of him when those original child’s play movies came out. Yikes! But I wonder if he would have tiny hooks haha I also feel he could slit an Achilles’ tendon effectively in dbd.
---
i dont know what "amazing effect" to give it though
---
No one ever counts Bill :'(
---
Yeah who cares about motorcycle billies or dbz nurses, jump scare killers for the win.
---
Funniest killers to play against are the spirit, myers, piggie (if she is not a head trap stalking cunt) jumpscare hag and bing bong, Because they can actually give you a heart attack.
---
Maybe you whenever you take a hit or do a gen, all other survivors auras are revealed for 5 seconds, and the killers is revealed for 2
---
Its been surreal. Ugh the show is a gold mind for potential DbD chapters. Like even for the weaker seasons, you'd have at least three potential options to pick from one season alone.
---
Same. Even with 3 blink Nurse, I give it a bit of time to see if the Nurse is terrible or not. For iri heads, I flat out refuse to play. Instant DC.

This is perfect and I love it!

the one parallel between both games that I absolutely hate is you are completely capable of bullying the fuck out of the killers given you have prepared to do so. 
---
I’m not sure why but it seems like every dev thinks it’s a good idea for survivors to be able to do this
---
There is no "civil" conversation to be had at this point, you have disgraced yourself and excluded yourself from the possibility of one. By all means continue to deny your wrong doing, continue to attack people rather then the basis of their arguments, but know this lad you won't ever get the respect you seem to so desperately desire doing so.
---
With the new MOM, you have to go much out of your way to get hit. Let’s say you run out in front of killer while they carry a person twice, then another time you get hit saving someone. Each hit takes about 30 seconds to heal up with self care. That’s 1:30 minutes. Then let’s add the time you waste by running from your gen to the killer for all these hits, adding about 30-40 seconds bringing us to a total of around 2 minutes of time wasted when you could have gotten gens done instead. Then let’s also take into account plenty of killers such as huntress, plague, and Michael can render this power useless. Then let’s also take into account the fact if you actually get it to go off and manage to escape your aura will be shown. This perk sounds pretty shit, right? You said you don’t play survivor often and it really shows.
---
Imagine being upset that they used one word over another word
---
The protection change was an idea, its not theyre final choice they even said that in theyre latest stream.
---
I'm suggesting the budget was allocated towards something else, smoothbrain
---
*pills here*
---
I stay as long as they don't camp. However, for some reason, every Huntress player camps.
---
Vanessa is made for running. If you spend your early game running after a Vanessa as jason then you are making all the wrong decisions. You guard objectives, and you go for the easy pickings. Vanessa might be fast, but she is useless at working on objectives. Also, you can run everybody out of their stamina, no matter what. It's only a matter of time. Don't compare F13 now to what it was when it came out.

Can you make this but for the supermarket map instead of cashier Carl lol

Even then, if they get to you, you can hide...

There seems to be a lot of JoJo fans in this subreddit

Looks fantastic, I really like the style!

he was probably thinking of the green/orange botanist aprons (or smhock)
---
You see his name at the end..?
---
You're complaining about NOED and Ruin, but the way to stop NOED and Ruin is by breaking totems. If you dont break them, you get punished. The purpose of Ruin/NOED is to extend the game or punish you for not breaking the totems. They're balanced.
---
Not now. When I saw it it was [removed]
---
i think they were trying to get sally hardesty with leatherface but they had some licensing issues or something, so they just turned her in to kate and slapped her on curtain call.
---
i could be wrong, i’m not sure if this is true
---
That would actually bring Freddy up to at least a B tier and make him a lot of fun. I'd buy him.
---
Where am i complaining exactly ?
---
Which killer would be next on the list?
---
The rage rework is ridiculous and didnt make me want to come back. Teaming is literally impossible to stop now. I used to fuck with teamers all the time with my friends and run out the clock easily. All it takes is a teamer to have his friend find a machete and smack him into rage mode and he cant be stunned.
---
Even not considering teaming its a ridiculous change. Goes to show how smart the devs are
---
If Dwight's a top then Quentin must be one of those "Vers tops".
---
As will I
---
I like calm spirit bc it feels dramatic when you fall over with no scream
---
I kind of want The Swamp Thing... they are doing a remake for the DC app and they made him look like some cool super villain killer trying to protect his SWAMP!
---
Maybe
---
Kinda wanna go with Chucky. New movie, new TV show. He's got the clout.
---
I would LOVE to have Carl as a survivor
---
Agreed. And schools have lots of opportunities to for open spaces with lots of obstructions
---
i wanna see black jacket leatherface from the final portion of the original texas chainsaw massacre
---
If only there were some type of wooden-like obstacles in place to run to when he appeared

How did she not hear you on coming back to the house?

---
I would love they implement a punishment for DCing, you lose your match points(already in place) and 10% of your pool bloodpoints if you have 0 yo go to negative and 10/2/30 minutes of wait time for the next match. OR something like DOTA2 does, pool you with people that do the same, so you are playing with a mirror reflexion of your toxicity.
---
Yes please.
---
Is this supposed to refute what I said?
---
I’m a simple man I see Carl I upvote.
---
Being a competitive person isnt an excuse for being such a crybaby every time he loses. If he was as good as Zubat then maybe his attitude would be understanable but hes barely above average after playing the game almost every day for 4+ hours.
---
Its 3 now.
---
By saying that running NOED and Ruin makes a good killer on a satire post about survivors. Comes off like salt lmao
---
I guess in case DH totem dies, at least you still have MYC
---
I think the change Iri heads needs is the 1 hatchet per toss should be a hard limit.  You shouldn't be able to run utility belt with it and get three 1hko hatchets.  While still powerful at least there's a clear change in how she's played and you have to be extremely accurate and have 1 shot at taking down the survivor before going to a locker.  It should get a "This add-on overrides all other add-on's" at the end of the text.  At the very least it's still a powerful add-on while having a clear drawback and a change in playstyle.  
---
Because yeah I would like to use the couple I have, and I know when I play against an iri head huntress everyone just DC's anyways, nobody wants to play against it.
---
\&gt; Make trailer about Ghost Face
---
\&gt; Everyone wants Carl, the cashier.
---
He's super dead though.
---
They may have done that cause it's the remake and the Nancy actress wasn't that great. They can get New Nightmare in cause he is a different character than original Freddy. That way we can have the original Nancy.
---
Wait, that game's server is still active?
---
Forgot gen rush with toolboxes, T-bag on every pallet, flashlight clicks and gg ez babykiller after killing 2 of them.

It’s her hips

I feel dirty.
---
Bruh i just read this thread. "Ruin helps you when you play bad." I've never seen this level autism.
---
I'm on board for everything but Chucky. And if they size him up then he isn't Chucky anymore. Tiny killers just dont work in this game. You'd lose survivors in literally every loop since your POV would be on the damn floor. Hag is bad enough in cornfields.
---
⸤  N O T O R I O U S  C L O W N  ⸣
---
Unlikely due to that lawsuit
---
Well i dont have most of those perks so ill have to work really hard. Thanks for the help!
---
Im new to killer, i was previously a survivor. Who should i level up first to unlock teachables? Im currently leveling up the cannibal for bbq.
---
Remember that good survivors don’t care about losing the killer. It more valuable to loop the killer for 10 minutes than it is for a minute and lose the killer. Do not use pallets unless you have to. Do not use a pallet and run to another pallet that is 10 feet away, put distance between pallets u use. If you don’t you will create entire dead zones. Remember you can fake a pallet drop, wait at a pallet like your gonna drop it and when the killer approaches just run. If the killer swing you can restart the entire loop. Look behind u as you run to judge the distance between you and the killer. Noob survivors have a tendency not to do this. Remember to watch the killer, when u loop a killer 90% of killers have a tendency to go the opposite direction they where going to trick you. You can restart the loop if they do this. At high ranks killer will start moon walking, if you don’t know where in the loop they went the best idea is to just leave the loop
---
So lets get rid of spirit fury then.
---
After the 4th that happened to me, I started maining killers
---
Wonder how spirit would work as a statue
---
Number 3 now!!!
---
F13 is for people who like to mess around and scream at random people in lobbies and during gameplay (although it sucks if you die early, and are stuck in the dead lobby for up to 20 minutes while waiting for others to die/get away)
---
At least in DBD you don’t have to wait forever if you are killed early in match (just leave the results screen and you are on your way to your next match)
---
I honestly really want this guy as a Survivor.
---
You're lucky I don't know where you live, buddy. I'm tard raging in my living room right now, spinning my replica chainsaw around manically,  making chainsaw noises while simultaneously screaming at a deafening volume. All the potted plants have been knocked over - soil everywhere. Kids are crying, well done.
---
If you ever disrespect sweet boy bubba again I'll face camp you for 12 consecutive games, then Mori your friends with his fat, meaty  mallet.
---
Uhm excuse me... F13 is super duper extremly better than DBD........
---
the game was great at its prime even with all the problems the community and just fun you had with other people was great now it's just terrible tbh doesn't make it better that the game is pretty much dead
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/let-dodge-sFMEZ1ZFToyha
---
With this attitude? No, you can't. If all you see is SWF r1 smurfs at green ranks gen rushing like madmens... No.
---
I think were gonna live forever needs an actual perk, bbq gives bloodpoints and does something wglf just gives bloodpoints
---
Wowwwww... again, huge congrats
---
I have another question, im new to killer so i basically dont know anything about killer. Which killers should i level up first for teachable perks? In currently leveling the cannibal for bbq and ill be done in a few hours, who should i level up next?
---
WE NEED CASHIER GUY    AS A SURVIVOR
---
Considering that New Line is 'The House that Freddy Built' you'd think they'd have more respect for the o.g. dream demon, huh?
---
New Decisive Strike is not worthless, IMAO. 
---
And they might come with a new idea for MoM nerf than protection hits.
---
I play her a lot. Have a bit over 1k hours on the game and at least 700 on huntress. She is hands down, the killer with the highest skill ceiling, as you can always get better aim. For example it took me a long time to get the skilled huntress achievement for downing 30 people 30 meters away.i just started getting used to the hatchet arc and learning how to throw them accurately over walls. She is super hard at the start, but once you get a feel for her aim and how she plays, along with how broken hitboxes are, she is one of the most fun and rewarding. Also both bbq and nurses are basically must haves on her.
---
That makes sense, Reapers mask goes farther up his head
---
AYAYAYAYAYAYAYA
---
It means they are only high ranked because they have had help from their team mates to get there, or they have only gotten to high ranks because they use nothing but the best addons, basically they have been “boosted” by all the help.
---
So we are forced to give extra time to chase someone, wastingf the killers time with litterly 0 way to counter play the free hit and its not your problem cause your a survivor main. people like you are the problem, thinking things arent a problem cause it doesnt effect you.
---
I've always thought David a vers, who's capable of flipping to either be a rugged top or a power bottom.
---
Why is this so true
---
I’m fine with this idea.
---
Just personal, I think it is better after chases, to know if the killer is still on your back
---
If SWF is such a big advantage, then why do SWF teams only have a survival rate a few percentages above regular solo players?
---
Evil Ash was behind the mask the whole time! \*Scooby Doo theme plays\*
---
Like 1 week ago I got legion to 50 and learned every perk...I have so many that I wish I could turn them in for bloodpoints
---
They should have said this when it first leaked so people wouldn’t get excited or have their hopes up.
---
No new map is kinda messed up though.
---
I picture the bear trap chomp-chomping around the map like Pac-Man...
---
Yeah, Ghostface and Ash kinda go hand in hand just like Leatherface and Bill.
---
Awesome work
---
Ahh, so basically, never really learning the characters strengths (in terms of killer, I suppose) and just going with whatever overpowered things they can obtain.
---
Because most people are survivor players.  Not a peep when Ash was released by himself.
---
Nah mate, he paid for the knife and rope he brought to the checkout lane lmao
---
I demand supermart and Carl!

---
Herbert West as survivor &amp; that damn cat as killer, make it happen Queen!!! O.O
---
Real talk tho, Candyman &amp; Maniac Cop would make for such great chapters imo. Phantasm might, but would be tougher to pull off (this coming from someone who wants to play as the Tall Man soooo much)
---
For a few, they changed the rules to not allow this, but majority didn't care.
---
Aw sicc
---
I don’t play much killer and when I do I suck but I have no issue with the killer playing toxic. Why not? If they’re not cheating and the killer is good enough to do what he wants with the survivors let him. He’s taking the risk by trying to show off. The point is to survive from the killer if you can’t then you’re at his mercy. Killers in horror movies are “toxic” and would do the same thing. Have fun with it.
---
Sure, the killer spends half a minuite in bloodlust three while I loop him round a dropped pallet, definately sounds like a free hit.
---
I mean you could stop chasing then after the hit, so they need to heal, or they wont heal and you can go back for them later... is DS a problem too? It stuns you and forces killers to lose extra time. Is BT a problem? It wastes the time you used to chase someone with BT only to have them absorb a hit. Its not a problem, its just another obstacle you guys have to play around now. You killer mains want it easy mode, and you dont get that with MoM. Too bad, so sad.
---
I don't know why you were downvoted. This is literally what it is. This community is utterly insufferable sometimes.
---
Any you get a free copy for a friend
---
Carl's perk would make every chest on the map have a "checkout" effect, where if a survivor chooses to loot an item, they must sacrifice bloodpoints to him. \*evilgrin\*
---
You definitely can put pressure on the map with an average killer against good survivors.
---
Last month he was playing the MK11 beta where people don't really want to waste time trying to learn a character for something lasting for only a couple days. He went a guy playing as someone he claimed "was the easiest and noobiest fighter in the beta" and kept losing because he couldn't learn from the opponent. So he started talking about how he could show him whose boss by selecting that said fighter because of how easy he is so chat starting saying "why don't you just show him then" and he just replies with "Oh well I would have to warm up first, of course." Tru3 can be entertaining at times but I feel as if he just lives in his own little arrogant world at other times.
---
To be fair, the addons are bad anyways.
---
NOE
---
Beautiful
---
This was me with the shape i used his three perks and almost double piped
---
F13 is trash sorry I'm surprised the game isn't completely dead
---
black outline white text
---
Very disingenuous. There are almost no pallets in the game that can be looped for more than a few seconds at bloodlust 3. (Shack and some pallets near the basement on the Game.) 
---
Just stand on the short side of the loop and force them to vault 1-2 times before hitting them. It's doable at no-bloodlust on many loops, and as soon as you hit bl 2 on "safe" loops.
---
There is no real counter to spirit fury other than making sure you don't give up a free double hit. Dropping the pallet early is worth 4-12 seconds at a safe loop, but eventually you have to take that hit. At an unsafe loop it's pointless, just explode the pallet and take your knocks. e.g. free hit.
---
I’m cool with it too, mostly. I’m more disappointed that we’re not getting a map than a survivor. Sure, Sidney would’ve been nice to have, but it’s not a big deal to me. Mostly I feel this is a missed opportunity to have a cool indoor map.
---
If in 2hours its 3am est for you then it's in 14 hours for 3pm for you
---
In 2 hours plus 1 day, it starts tomorrow
---
Okay thank you
---
Same, that would’ve been really cool. We have tons of outdoor maps, need another indoor.

Really?  [Cringe](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bha8cn/possible_ghostface_dbd_info/) and [Whining.](https://twitter.com/TheWorldOfRSB/status/1129905230190141441)  It was really cool of RJ Torbert to let a fan announce Ghostface but to say that he isn't being a complete baby about it is false. Looks like his whining paid off though because he's getting it paid for by Paulie.
---
Edit: And no I haven't been harassing him...  It does suck that he didn't get to announce it but he's not entitled to that announcement.
---
CAAAAAAARRRRL!!
---
im thinking since its called the ghost face chapter instead of the scream chapter it means they only got the killer license
---
Maybe survivors blink inside his terror radius
---
Meh, Ill probably buy it just to play survivor. The survivor grind is kinda small compared to the killer one.
---
Rush the good teachables, and then just drop all the BP to the survivor you like the most.
---
I'm sure Myers could find someone better
---
Then 2 survivors, just like how SCP contains him
---
All survs blink at once perhaps?
---
You always have to take that hit with or without playing against SF; its just a matter of when. Useing the stated counterplay you can significantly increase chase time against it. Yes on some maps the perks stronger but that's some map and even on the game there are still loops you can waste a lot of time at.
---
Instructions reduce charge depletion by 20%. So if you would use 20 charges on a regular toolbox, if you had instructions, you would only use 16 charges for the same amount of repairs. Repair Speed increases the speed in repairing.
---
Lol wtf. Just joined this sub yesterday.  No regrets so far xD
---
I think Maniac Cop or Re-Animator would be really cool, although both aren’t as well known as the others.
---
Why did it seem like the ghostface trailer had a bigger budget than the entire game?
---
If you're having trouble with Wraith, you'll get destroyed by Spirit lol. Spirit is so much harder to play against.
---
exactly. 
---
Until survivor gameplay changes between different characters, new survivors will always be irrelevant to me outside of grinding out their perks for my current main.
---
Maps and new killers &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
You are correct. The exact point of the post is that chase is sometimes not occurring despite all of those conditions being met.
---
"Nobody cares about you anymore, old man!" -GhostFace, probably
---
Either.  key sites can be a bit shady, so watch your back.
---
I look forward to tunneling/camping you in game.   Only the cockiest of assholes run that mask, and are usually the saltiest shits (win or lose) in post game chat.
---
You're just getting unlucky.
---
In case you're unaware, there are offerings that can be burnt by either side to increase the odds of getting maps from a certain realm. You can see which offerings were burnt before you load into the map or when pressing "Escape" in-game. Your best bet is burning a map offering that isn't Coldwind Farm.
---
So, the dark times all over again? No thanks
---
Its random, so you are just unlucky.
---
But farm maps are not the worst for killers anymore, you will get used to the corn, its not that hard to track surivors in there.
---
Unlucky, unless the survivors bring offerings that allow the chance for  Coldwind Farm to be picked
---
Revert back to sabotage meta?
---
No thanks
---
I pay attention to the offerings, i don’t see any that indicate Coldwind being picked. That’s unfortunate though for sure lol.
---
I wouldn't say so. It would be an ultra rare addon and the ammount of hooks destroyed would be limited to amount of charges in your toolbox
---
No worries. Hard to tell either way though text.
---
I don't understand how they are "extremely toxic". They are pretty harmless honestly. By the way, I don't do these things.
---
Your bait is bad and you should feel bad.
---
I just see a lot of people with weird humour on here.  So I try to assume that everyone knows that I’m joking.  That’s my bad.
---
Yeah no sabotage is cancer if the hooks don't repair, thats how it was when the game came out so we had to run Iron Grasp.
---
 I’ve put a considerable amount of time into the game in the last few days, and i have yet to see probably 60% of the maps lol. Unlucky is a good word to describe it i guess.
---
DemiPlays has a Discord server. He’s a really funny DbD youtuber and I think he deserves more respect. It’ll be in any of his Video descriptions
---
I watched Tru3 a few times and he's basically everything i hate in a killer.
---
Thinks bringing items are toxic. Every team that does well must be swf. Looping = toxic. Doing gens in a timely manner because there's no pressure = toxic.
---
And when he has a bad game he spends like 10 minutes in endgame chat just ranting about it. Uses literally every excuse as to why he didn't win and tries to make the survivors feel bad about it.
---
And then says his stream is positive vibes only, lol.
---
I really love all the contrast!!! It pops so much, it's very appealing to just look at.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Ze1ZztPKA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Ze1ZztPKA) 
---
This one? No, I hadn't. Nothing I was unaware of though.
---
First example loop, pallet by the crane: 100% bloodlustable. Survivor will take a hit within 8 seconds.
---
Second example loop, pallet in long-wall jungle gym: Not worth bloodlusting, killer breaks pallet. Loop is now dead. There are not that many long-wall jungle gyms on a given map. 
---
Countered?
---
It wouldn’t be too hard to add him with the model already. They might possibly release him for free once they get some time after this 3rd year anniversary
---
I mean yeah sure its not like if players i dont do gens while im chasing one or looking for one. Its like they have never had 3 gens pop after one chase. Im a survivor main btw.
---
Yeah. If he did it the whole game then you have the absolute right to BM him. However if he only did it once the gates were powered then what did you expect him to do? Leave the hook so the survivor can escape for free? I hate when survivors complain about it in the end game when the killer LITERALLY has nothing else they can do.
---
But that’s it. He eats the shit out of pallets and stealth usually isn’t that good against competent survivors.
---
This looks fucking awesome
---
true, in high ranks, if the Players know what they do, you can easily have 3 gens pop at the same time
---
N. E. A. T.
---
Thanks :)
---
Possibly.  But there are 11 original IP killers.
---
What if freddy get's dragged out of the dream world for a certain amount of time when getting stunned or hitting the obsession? The meter on his power is time he has outside of it.
---
Lmao got em
---
"Exploiting" lol. 4 man groupz only have a 5% better chance at surviving you're over exaggerating real hard here
---
sprint burst your problems away!
---
That's definitely the case. The rights to the face belong to a Halloween costume/mask company. The ghost face mask came out in the early 90s, years before the film Scream. The mask was used in the film because the director insisted it be used as he thought the design was perfect. So Ghost Face and Scream are two entirely different things. If the devs wanted to use actual characters, locations, and references from the Scream films, they would have had to not only acquire the license for the mask from the Halloween company, they would have also had to deal with the movie studio that owns the film franchise, which would have perhaps cost more work and money for the devs. So I'm happy with what we're getting, but I'll always wish for more and perhaps we will get actual Scream content in the future.
---
Coughing intensifies
---
Lets say its 2-3 hooks per toolbox you know you’ll get the 4 man swf who run 4 toolboxes so you’d either have to run franklins instead of a better perk and all it takes is one person running you around for other survivors to sabo all the hooks. I’m also having flashbacks to 4 jakes running around breaking all my hooks when i first got the game and my god was it awful.
---
Killer but im biased
---
Its kate. Always the ones you least expect

Of all the trailers that had kills, which one did you think was the best?
---
All streamers do tbh
---
Ok so lets keep talking about Carl at the devs and they might add him
---
I always thought Meg looked a bit like Sidney.
---
In Scream 2 Sidney has a short bob that resembles Meg’s even more.
---
Hahah, poor you. Looks like this problem is everywhere. The devs gotta do at least a little bit to close such big gaps.
---
100% have seen Xbox One disc copies at Target.
---
Damn right thats what their doing
---
It's because they don't have the scream license.
---
You might be right about the use of paragraph but leatherface is not listed as chapter 6, ANOES is, as well as Ash not currently being listed as Ch12 so again it’s a bit inconsistent if ghostface is listed as a chapter. I’m still happy to get him in the game regardless:)
---
Spam the crouch button when you see the killer
---
We all have to demand Carl into the game
---
Nope , I was watching a video in the second monitor and it kept going on .
---
Edit : Also game gave me 4 quiter bonus points 1250 x 4 which equals to 5000 and that 102 is chainsaw rush.
---
He erases time
---
Yeah they died so why not add Carl
---
Carl
---
No thank *you* random citizen!

Just tried it, pretty horrible
---
When you're in the Dream World, Freddy can see your aura when there is no heartbeat.
---
Some actions can wake you up or wake someone else up:
---
* Failing a skillcheck on a generator will wake up anyone on it.
---
* Failing a healing skillcheck will wake up the person that's being healed (this also applies to self-healing). 
---
* Awake survivors can wake up slept survivors by holding M1 on them.
---
* Adrenaline will also wake you up when activated.
---
* Fully healing someone on the ground will wake them up.
---
Split up so he can't sleep all of you at once.
---
Try to understand when it's worth to be woken up or wake up somebody. Freddy could just sleep the both of you afterwards.
---
Premonition is good if you want to try to prevent the chase, but you dont get chase points. Premonition is just good because even if you dont avoid the chase, you know which direction they are coming from, so you can start your run. He is slowed down when uncloaking so try to run before he starts uncloaking. Urban Evasion could be good if you want to lose him, vault over something and then try to crouch walk away.. idk, I usually never lose a killer unless I get to somewhere I can. Instead of trying to lose the wraith, try lopping for a while, so teammates can do gens. If you really want to try to lose him, Urban evasion and a window is good. Either vault through the window and then crawl away and hide until he loses you. Idk, you lose him like you lose a normal killer, I am not good at doing that so I am probably not the best person to ask... when you do lose him you need to watch him and see where he goes while invis and go the other way.

For all of the super strong ultra rare addons, like Iridescent head, or Infinite tier 3 Myers, exposed clown gas, extra nurse blinks etc. Should take up 2 addon slots IMO. That way you can have a powerful addon, but can't run iridescent head with more than one hatchet, like you suggest. This would also make it easier to add strong addons for future killers without making them too exploitably strong.
---
Also no nurse needs 5 blinks &gt;_&gt;

This is kinda why I prefer Zubat over Tru3. Sure, Zubat might be pretty dickish here and there, but when he loses hard, he admits it was his loss.
---
What im going to do is buy hag with money after i finish cannibal, ill probably have enough shards to buy spirit after i finish leveling up hag.
---
We’ve known this since he was leaked
---
I often see what he means though. 
---
The maps are RNG based. They can either have 30 pallet spawns, or 15. There are only so many tile spaces on a map, some are landmarks, but the rest are random. Either it has possible pallet spawns, or its just windows.
---
If you get the unlucky spawns, even if you don't get max pallets, or min lockers as Huntress, it can be a bit more survivor favored, and good survivors will be aware of this. 
---
The hills are rotated the wrong way for Hooking, or the right way for escapes with balanced. The gens are in safer spots, or are spread out well from spawn. Lockers are all clumped up and hard to get to for Huntress. 2 cow tree loops on rotton fields. The rare double pallet loop. Window beside top of basement stairs on haddonfield is open, among other window spawns. All can add up to a harder match for killer, and it's undeniable. You can't win them all, because the RNG can make it less or more difficult.
---
He does need to understand that more, but it's not uncommon for a killer to always have someone on a hook, and always be in a chase, yet still have a tough time closing it out against good survivors.
---
At a point, rank 1 killers should expect to lose, and get a kill or 2 at best if the matchup is fair.
---
I actually thought about buying the new Legion neon skin but the price is fucking ridiculous. I'm not paying that for a digital skin.
---

---
Chill out dude it's a game. People been teabagging in games since they added the crouch feature. I would hardly call it extremely toxic.
---
I know it's not Tuesday, but here it goes... Can you distinguish which hex the killer is carrying due to the totem? As if the design of the totem changes depending if it is NOED, Haunted Grounds, or Ruin? I know the difference is the fire - but I have noticed some streamers point out that a firey totem is either Haunted Grounds or Ruin.
---
Ask them. They probably think I'm boasting

He's right there goddamn are you blind just take a slice!
---
Need more jpeg.
---
Video was probably making the survivors lag
---
I disagree, the map is the biggest addition to the game. It is immediately added to rotation as soon as it launches without anyone having to buy anything. Everyone is affected. 
---
I've probably seen 3 or 4 Plagues since she released. And survivors are just skins.
---
Pretty much this.  Its absurd that at these ranks this still happens but I'll get started on a gen immediately, less than 30 seconds into the match a survivor gets downed (Hit then hit again almost INSTANTLY), and everyone else goes for the save leaving all gens unattended.  The next 5-10 minutes are the 3 other survivors saving then taking the saved survivors turn on the hook until they're all on death hook and I've only got 2 generators complete. Increase in Hex: Ruin aside I'm really hoping that ranks 8 to 1 have level headed survivors that can make good judgement calls and run more than 10 second chases.
---
I never said F13 was flawless, infact it had a lot of flaws, but the core concept and basic ideas were great, whereas I believe DBD is flawed in it's core.
---
If we talking characters they are and if you mean the game play, they can easily give him a different power than what Freddy have since New Nightmare is an actual demon and not human.
---
Nah, I play p3 Freddy on ps4
---
Putting ttv in your name is just a free victim card. You can say anything that happens is stream sniping.
---
Isnt it kind of toxic to assume we are just greedy for perks? Lol
---
I corrected it to the 30k mentioned in the dev stream. Again, reading would help. Relax you concentrated dust
---
OK hun bye
---
How do I change my user flair to yours!
---
Bye!

“You’re illiterate because you didn’t see my edit in time haha”

“NoED is unbalanced and needs some minor tweaking.”

“That’s perfect!!”

No one complained about Leatherface. That was called a chapter and all it came with was Leatherface. That was called a chapter by players and devs as far as I know.
---
No one complained about Ash, and I swear I counted several people calling them a chapter.
---
Why complain now? I'm sure I got one of or both of these wrong, but really?
---
Start diggin boi
---
He did, the person who is dead on our team died because of this. All 3 of us tried to save him and he slugged us, luckly i had unbreakable and tenacity and was able to revive the other 2.
---
Are you talking about pigs traps?? If so they have to be inactive.
---
if the timer is on, the trap still kills
---
Okay, thanks, unfortunately I am still a high level (like 18) so my teammates aren’t the most helpful, I can usually loop for quite a while, I stopped playing but I used to be able to infinite loop pretty decently until it got patched.
---
Also kind of unrelated but I have noticed even when I lose pretty badly I still sometimes gain exp for rank points, I would prefer not to rank up to a level where I can’t contend, but is there a reason for this or is it basically the same as exp
---
they have the right for the mask from the Halloween store that sells it. they don't have the right to scream
---
Yeah decisive strike is a must have. I’m gonna go with Myers. ☺️
---
If they are nice i will be nice, if they are toxic i will be even more toxic&lt;3 I love faking that i will give them the hatch lmao
---
I'm pretty sure literally no one who face camps complains about gens getting done, man this community sure loves to just, make up silly complaints that the "other side" are supposedly saying
---
Reverse Bear Traps? They will still go off if they are *active.* They'll only activate when a generator is powered now, they will not activate if the trap is applied after the last generator is powered.
---
Yeah I bought it just now. I love the Laurie Perks, she’s the only reason I wanted this dlc.
---
Can we get a face rework?
---
Maybe the original green and red sweater
---
As someone who plays survivor 2/3rds of the time, I still feel like this is a bad idea.
---
But like the usual one or THE SUPER LOUD HADDONFIELD EDITION?
---
Jeff is real Jesus
---
yep his ego is very fragile, but at least he's entertaining
---
wish they would make it so DCs give a BBQ stack for the point bonus.
---
Tru3 has always been a competitive person,  plays mortal kombat and what not. Puppers is a chill streamer, always in a costume. I don't think you can really compare the two.
---
Quentin, for example
---
New line is a joke, wanting reboot freddy to be the freddy is a chance they had but it is no longer going to happen because they made their movie bad and his design silly
---
On one hand, I love watching a knowledgeable player like him fucking dump on a group of survivors, SWF or not. Some of his games are against some real pissbabies though, especially the ones who DC cause he outplayed them. 
---
On the other hand, he is really annoying to hear complain about anything. And some of his decisions on things are so silly it’s hard to tell if he’s just trolling or actually that thick sometimes. 
---
At least he’s mildly entertaining to watch cause having to listen to many of the other popular dbd content creators is a fate worse than death.
---
Except it's on an Alex's, the worst toolbox for doing gens. I got it from a a chest.
---
\&gt; Announce Ghost Face
---
\&gt; People want Carl
---
We had our priorities wrong this whole time. *Darn.*
---
Doctor was reworked?
---
nah men , they're just butthurt , when i get 3 down usually they rq and this one is also a similar game .
---
[http://prntscr.com/nvjlym](http://prntscr.com/nvjlym) because quiting without dying means obviously you win !
---
Oh that’s totally cool. But in my scenario the guy just hooked me afterwards and then shook his head at me. Wack.
---
Camping IS a legit strategy.  Mostly only good against tryhard swf groups, because you know they’ll come for the save no matter what.
---
2 words : Dwight cult
---
i wouldn't suggest you to learn more about the game from the person who knows dead hard from its release and still can't wait for people to use it.. knowledge, i guess yes but not skill
---
I browsing it only for official news and shitposts
---
I love this entire conversation.
---
Overpowered? no. Annoying as fuck? *yes*.
---
Unfortunately yes. There are also the pants from the new hiking set that you could potentially wear but they're kinda pricey.
---
2 words: oh no
---
Recently? Went back and forth between the hatch and a hook on Haddonfield while carrying the last surv during EGC. I hadn't been goofing off at all during the round so they didn't know whether I was being toxic or not. Dropped them on the hatch with just enough time for them to jump in before the timer ran out, nearly gave them a heart attack lol
---
Freddy. Camp. Yikes.
---
I'm at a gain for words
---
Ni-
---
thanks :)
---
The trapper and the wraith got me tangled
---
Of course you need to go out of your way to activate it, the problem with the old MoM was that most killers had no option but to activate it. That's the problem with it.
---
[Probably this](https://youtu.be/nvcKr9ynf0Y)
---
:D don’t care
---
[this is also a favorite of mine](https://youtu.be/EgdvhEuQG-4)
---
I can't wait to run spine chill as survivor and literally counter his entire power lol
---
“I might lose all my karma on this post”
---
Who even cares about karma. It’s completely useless
---
Calm down killer main, they do. 
---
I’ve had nurses facecamp then complain we genrushed and that’s why she facecamps lmao
---
Appreciate people with this attitude, welcome.
---
Oh my god... I’ve been stuck at rank 9 for a week!!! Nobody does gens at all and nobody knows how to juke the killer for more than 10 seconds!!! Fml
---
Yes! 540p, 15fps, no cross progression and less content.
---
I can't wait for the Switch version!
---
Lol nobody wants to go back to the perma sabo days except toxic Survivors.
---
Ok uhhh, but I’ve been watching tru3 for a year or two now, and in all that time, I have never heard him say that looping or lack of pressure is toxic, but I would love to be proved wrong there. Heck he even plays a good survivor to see the other side, where he’d be a huge hypocrite to say looping is toxic. When he talks in the endgame, it’s because the survivors have a misconception of how he played, for example a recent Freddy game where he juggled the survivors, and they ended up blaming him of tunneling, despite him playing a 4v1 instead of a 1v1. This game has a way of making the most tame people salty, and you gotta be hard pressed to find someone who gets a little salty from it. Every game he plays he says gg at the end too, so idk what you’re really talking about. Overall I’d like to see some proof of your claims, but I hold a firm belief that, while not perfect, tru3 is one of the best killers out there.
---
Yeah I have a disc copy
---
Offerings are supposed go back in to your inventory when this happens.
---
Console or PC?
---
Because I thought they literally just changed that, unless the patch is still incoming, you're supposed to go back to load out, and keep all stuff.
---
me and these dudes found a bubba protecting his chest and our goal was to open it he actually didn't hook us
---
I'd like steve to come in since he's fought the demigorgon
---
Lol kinda pathetic tbh
---
You "Heard". if it didn't come straight from the devs not a single thing  you heard were true.
---
it was once against an insta hatches Huntress (i tried to do my adept Laurie) and all of my teammates dc'd so i got the tokens for Sole Survivor and i messed around with that Huntress so bad that i thought she was going to dc as well (the match was on Haddonfield and she was on top of the balcony in the Myers' house with her axe up, hoping that she can spot me and get an easy down) while i safely did 2 gens and looked for the hatch but she found it first and i was kind of scared to go there so i did one more gen to bait her and i escaped (she messaged me after that i'm actually an immersed god so i told her that SS+OoO carried me and she never knew that you can gain tokens for the dc)
---
Be careful what you wish for.
---
I thought he would be the new survivor and the map would be the super market. Such wasted potential.
---
Bro, i just did that too lmao
---
PC.
---
i agree espescially with that annoying youtuber sleeved\_biker like he just spams his opinion about ft13th being better which is annoying af
---
map
---
It's really easy since all you have to do is survive. You should get it within 3 games per survivor unless you have really bad luck. Only difficult one is Laurie since you have to use object of obsession which is tricky, but she's DLC so you said you're not focusing on that yet.
---
He’s going to be the unlock for getting to tire 100 in the battle pass.
---
It will sell millions.
---
He might end up in the backrooms
---
Then someone told me im a dirty farmland in france because i gave him the hatch
---
Okay maybe it is a big problem, apparently, judging by the downvotes I got? Maybe I just get lucky or something
---
 Also made two copies of Legion: https://imgur.com/pGaILqc
---
Tbh I'd prefer him over pig 🤣 ( I'm a Quentin main 😑)
---
Yes
---
Noob3 seems less toxic than before but he'll still bully killers that obviously aren't that good.
---
Sure, but the problem with the new version is that it wastes significantly more time to activate it than the use you get from it. There are many better perks you could use instead. Clearly you didn’t read my comment very well.
---
Had to post again with a diffrent screenshot of the rope cause the bot thought I was reposting because I posted this with a picture of "The Rope" and it was a screenshot used in another post lol
---
Even though the killer is facecamping, obnoxious hyena laughing swf group with crutch perk loadouts makes me wanna root for billy
---
I literally thought the same thing until just now. I was also hoping for fat guy survivor. RIP tubby.
---
I'm wondering if it's 9 Killers included at base; so you buy/download the 6 licenced Killers, Huntress and possibly Plague?
---
"I face camp cause of gen rushing and then I get gen rushed even harder" I mostly play killer cause on ps4 you can barely find survivor games at night and have gotten gen rushed sometimes but wtf is the point of face camping. There is nothing fun about it. When I play survivor it makes me furious that I waited 20 minutes to get a lobby with an insidious using trapper or leather face who is face camping and have the nerve to hit your body on the hook as if they are doing something challenging. Don't say he's a killer main cause most are not like that.
---
Its buried treasure my guy. You gotta dig it up.
---
one thing that is diffrent between them is tru thinks hitboxes are fine but puppers think they are not
---
&gt;rank 19
---
Imagine my shock
---
You don’t get it dude- it’s not that it wastes time necessarily, it’s that it activates too easily without much of a consequence. In a close game, even one person with MoM will break it. Yes, decisive wastes time too but the killer has a way of countering that- it doesn’t activate by merely playing the game (getting M1’d in the case of MoM).
---
You already admitted it isn’t your problem and you haven’t dealt with it yet, so I’m not sure why you feel the need to argue against it being OP.
---
Such a shitty design. Can completely block the basement
---
I’m over here like “oh the killer is coming our way? He’s chasing you? He’s still extremely close? Ima just stay on this gen til he commits to me” lol
---
I mean the things he says about survivors is based on experience. If they look back he’s expecting dead hard. Why are people crying about this? I watch True for pointers and to get better. I watch Monto for pointers and to laugh. Then Puppers/Ohmwrecker for just laughs since they probably take it serious the least.
---
i dont understand why people prefer a killer to a survivor when killers are like the number 1 part of this game and are probably more important than survivor
---
Leatherface for Barbecue and Chilli, Ash for Mettle of Man, and Myers because ~~he’s daddy af~~ there are so many different ways to play him.
---
Made a streamer whiff 3 hits on me during a chase, he dc'd, and when I went to watch the vod he blamed me for cheating and reported me. Lmao
---
It is utter garbage. I only solo queue and that's where I run into face camping fuckheads. You make the gen rush happen by sitting with a thumb up your ads doing nothing.
---
Exactly! Ahah
---
All original content up to and including spirit/adam is my guess.
---
No Pumpkinhead?
---
i think we did a pretty good job so far
---
A lot of people were also for it or indifferent towards it.
---
Those who were for the pass got downvoted on most of the threads talking about the topic. It was not appreciated on this subreddit to be for the pass, so few of those who liked the idea of the pass voiced their opinion.
---
Just because reddit was vocal about it doesn't mean that majority of the playerbase dislikes it. 
---
Reddit HATED Legion for months, and in the weeks approaching and following the rework we suddenly started getting Legion loving posts. I wouldn't put too much value in reddit posts.
---
Warner Bros if you hear us, make a dbd x DCAU crossover happen
---
They actually called Ash a chapter, but its unnumbered.
---
If you play altruisticly then you'll get it easily. If we're counting a protection hit as when the killer hits you when they're trying to hit someone else. So theoretically, the perk will work.
---
Yeah that’s what I’m saying, they did it for LF too. Labeling the DLCs isn’t consistent for bhvr haha
---
Yay this game is getting even more recognition :)
---
He's in there lol
---
I think hag is a free killer on all platforms unless I’m mistaken. I just know the PS4 version has it included.
---
Is that what bottom right is? I couldn't tell. I guess I forgot what he looked like.
---
Yep thats him
---
Wat.
---
i agree but i hate when people teabag especsially at the exit gates espescially when i never do anything to bm them pretty much
---
Can I ask for the original template?
---
if you pay attention that is not the location of the basement just saying
---
I really hope the Dc's get fixed soon.
---
meh
---
Biggest respect for such skill...Will be looking over at your twitch, gotta support people with talent like you
---
Ntrd?
---
Premonition has a cooldown. Whereas spine chill is always active and ready to alert you.
---
So what, it's an extra hit that leaves them visible for the rest of the game. Its really easy to track them.
---
Don't tell these victims that.
---
Bro, I want bbq so bad but don't want to buy big botch bubba.
---
The hatch spawns when the number of generators completed = the number of survivors left alive +1. Otherwise, as part of the new endgame, the hatch always spawns and opens when there is only one survivor left. In return, the killer can now close the hatch but this instantly finishes all generators, powering the exit gates.
---
🎵Here comes the trapper, better watch out for his traps!  Here come the trapper, better eat some ginger snaps!🎵
---
Dude
---
Then you met the prerequisites.
---
The hatch spawns when there are 2 survivors left, opens when there only one alive. Now it doesn’t matter how many gens were done. The killer can also close the hatch triggering end game collapse. At that point the doors power on.
---
But in the end it should be at least expected to someone who calls himself TRUE TALENT to be arrogant, I realised too late
---
You have to double pip.
---
It sounds easy in theory, but for killers who need help slowing down the game, it's extremely hard to do. Some killers genuinely just suck with their base perks, and you pretty much have to have a perfect game with said shitty perks. Also at higher ranks, this becomes an extremely frustrating task.
---
Not only that, but the game has to go on long as well. If you end it too quickly, you wont get enough points to double pip. 
---
And if you extend the game too long, you run the risk of losing control of it and the survivors destroying you. 
---
So for example, if you face a bunch of potato survivors, you have to purposely let the game go on because you can't end it too quickly. If a survivor DC's you also can't get it now, because you wont have enough points. 
---
It generally just puts too much power into the hands of the survivor, when it's a killer based achievement. You can get screwed out of your "perfect game" by someone who quits, or you straight up can't get it the team your facing sucks ass. 
---
A killer should not have to purposely extend the game to get an achievement. The killer's job is to kill, you'd think an "adept killer" is one who can do that as quickly as possible, yet you are now forced to let the game on longer. 
---
Whereas Adept survivor is still to simply escape. It's ridiculous.
---
you mean the one who wears make up and dresses like a woman!?!
---
It means they're AFK
---
I don't think any of them died, although these theories are super cool! I think they almost died or just got kidnapped. Basically, The Entity found them on the verge of death or hopeless.
---
People who DC are pieces of trash on both survivor and killer side. Literally trash cans.
---
Quick reply, but I've seen the crows there even if they are moving and doing other actions.
---
It means they’re useless teammates
---
F yeah!
---
It takes time for the crows to disappear once you come back. They don't instantly go away.
---
From the wiki:
---
Stillness Crow | Time the Survivor is Active
---
---|---
---
3 | Immediately on interaction, 5 seconds on leaving the area
---
2 | 15 seconds
---
1 | 30 seconds
---
I'd say David, dead hard is more fun
---
The birds take time to go away.
---
They are literally babies
---
Even if they deliver with that one, I will never purchase it or drop another dime on them.
---
this is the oposite of me when i play lf
---
Remember all those videos and people saying that DBD was doing to die once DG came out because it was so much better, much more balanced and all the killers were going to leave DBD for it? 
---
DG came out and the only talk I saw about it was about the Meg mask lol.
---
Doesn't have to be AFK, necessarily, just staying in the same spot for extended periods of time. They don't immediately disappear when you move away either.
---
Ay, nobody's perfect lads, I like him tho, his arrogant side is more funny to me than anything else
---
Everytime someone disconnected while loading I got my offerings back. Just when you are the one who crashed on loading screen you gonna lose your offering.
---
That's what I did. Got them all in the same day.
---
Oh yea i got so used to it that those didnt pop in my head
---
I don't have legacy skins. I only joined a week before they went exclusive and the grind back then was miserable. 
---
And maybe there's a point if the old players are complaining. You know, the ones who've played the game the longest. This would be like me telling a mom how to parent better.

When the team dies to this, I cry.
---
Same for slug nurse. Everyone wants to run in help right away, and then they go down, or sit there waiting for the killer to stop playing scummy. Like they will switch starts mid match.
---
Yeah, it's a total nightmare
---
I dont call dropping a pallet early precise.
---
Whoa rotten fields can spawn two cow trees? I don't think I have ever seen that before. I have encountered a double pallet loop once which was pretty wild.
---
It's a player versus player game. As such, how difficult the game is always depends to a large extent on the player(s) you are playing against. In general, playing survivor is more mechanically demanding, and playing killer more mentally demanding.
---
damn what? i only have meg prestige and i like the mask. That is no indeed that im salty or an asshole :( i never flamed in after game chat. You broke my heart
---
Pretty much the exact same thing Ive been saying for a while now. Glad this sub is finally getting over their hate boner and actually upvoting a comment like this.
---
Well, rank 1-3 is mostly only played by people in SWF so yeah, it is a big deal when all 4 have 3 hits to get down in the late game, "but just use a killer that can instadown" yeah, that is why high rank is full of hillbilly and nurses, because m1 killers have it hard to down a guy that has dh,adrenaline,mom and ds/iw.
---
I'm fine with her but I hate her camera spin. If prompts weren't locked to the camera's position I'd like her better. So many times going in lockers instead of vaults.

It sucks when the survivors are just a team of ghosts who left without a trace. :(
---
The traps aren't for you to catch survivors with really. They're more about buying you time.
---
A Survivor with a trap on is a Survivor not doing gens.
---
So if it takes them 2 min to search all 4 jigsaw boxes to get their trap off (best case scenario for you), then that's 2 min per survivor where you have one less survivor working on a gen.
---
So game flow ideally goes like this:
---
-Game start = 4 Survivors on gens
---
-Chase 1 survivor = 3 survivors on gens
---
-Down and trap Survivor, then hook.
---
-Now since someone has to unhook them and one is on hook. You have only 2 survivors on gens.
---
-If you find one of those gen rushing survivors and chase them, now only 1 survivor is on gen.
---
-Meanwhile after first survivor gets unhooked, they still have to go get trap off. So if you're on someone, that means still only 2 possible survivors on gens.
---
Wash, Rinse, Repeat this formula.
---
So instead of you chasing 1 survivor while 2-3 work on gens all match, your traps make it so only 1-2 are working on gens as long as you keep pressure on.
---
This makes gens take longer to pop and gives you more time to get downs and hooks.
---
But if you keep focusing on the person with the trap on, you might as well not have trapped them at all because you're keeping 2-3 people on gens that way.
---
Yes traps can come off on the first box if they're lucky. But that's part of the RNG.
---
Even if they only give you 30 seconds of non-generator time each on each survivor, that's still 2 extra minutes for you to get downs and hooks without gen progress being made from them that you wouldn't have otherwise.
---
So don't look at the traps as something to help you continue to down the trapped the survivor but to help buy you time to down ANOTHER survivor that isn't trapped atm.
---
I do like me some thumbs up my abs. ;)
---
Okay buddy. I'm just saying if you do have a red pinp it doesnt matter which side it's on it will screw up everyone's ping. Sorry for trying to help lol.
---
I finished my essay for my finals and I'm bored. Loaded up reddit and saw comment notifications.
---
Is half of Jojo just classic rock references?
---
I suspect OP got trapped *before* the last gen was done, last gen popped, and he ran for the door thinking it wouldn't kill him even though the last gen armed the trap.
---
That's exactly right. But it's so nice I dont want to not have it. I'm pretty op against stealth killers.
---
I play both survivor and killer and honestly i think playing survivor is way easier, unless they are playing against hillbilly or nurse
---
Pumpkin head fucking please. I would love a large monster killer
---
half the characters and abilities are musical references
---
&gt;Mainly survivor mains
---
And then people wonder why there is so much animosity between both sides. Survivor mains aren't more toxic than killer mains, there are just more of them due to the asymmetric nature of the game therefore creating that illusion.
---
Ok maybe I'll check it out. I'm not typically an anime guy

I watched his hag video last night where the survivor brought the flashlight, and he wasn't calling them toxic or anything.  He literally was just making a point that one good survivor with a flashlight can ruin Hag.  Which is true...
---
Iron will doesn't affect survivors in the dying state
---
can recommend
---
It doesnt? Actually didn’t know that, thx
---
Quick! Prestiege him and get his 3rd legacy
---
Solo survivor is hardest.
---
I never use that. Do you mean urban? I just walk around. If my cat lights up I just crouch.
---
I am he is 33 rn
---
That takes me back. It really makes me realize just how much I take the updated lobby for granted, it used to be so grey.
---
Points and SOMETIMES fishing noobs as billy/nurse
---
Man, it needs a tweak, its too powerful rn, its that good, that survivors that have it use it in every damn build
---
Basically it's not a chapter.
---
That’s just objectively wrong
---
Yeah, kinda, they basically gave him a fat buff as he was extremely weak when he was first released
---
That too, but I'm not referring only to the code specifically. Game balance involves a lot of interconnected abstract stuff that gets changed if you touch only one of them as well. You change how rank is calculated? Now all rank requirements and AI settings and lot's of other things should be adapted as well. And it's not always a straightforward adaptation. And it's not always a healthy change to begin with.
---
And you say that the code should have been better to begin with - but everything should be perfect while it's not. It's how games are developed, and basically how everything goes irl - there are mistakes and here we are, searching for ways to deal with them.
---
I understand where you're coming from though, just personally I'm not that affected unless I'm playing a killer I suck at. You have a point but I still think this Nerf is a little much
---
That's because it's Ash. Who would complain about that?
---
What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?
---
I'll Be Back
---
The Rules
---
I was kind of bummed about not having a new map, but I could care less about a survivor. Killers and their perks are what bring variety to me.
---
It is I... a terrible noob at being chased, apparently. I'll have to memory erase the subreddit once I learn how to run away better w/ all this new advice!
---
Ohh, I see! Thanks for the heads up since I've only gotten into the game during the free weekend and didn't understand the whole fuss over him.
---
i guess im buying hag with iridescent shards and clown with dlc then, already have ace lol
---
Thanks for not dcing instantly. My last prayer bead spirit 4 survivors were working on a gen and I must have scared the one I pulled off as they dced  as soon as I grabbed him.
---
Grim Pantry
---
Quentins rise up
---
Clown is big dick energy RRRRREEEE
---
Hey hey. Stop it.  We're getting battlepa$$ with some $weeta$$ co$metic$!!!!!  I cannot wait to pay good money so that I can grind like holy hell for some cool looking skins!!!!!!!!  
---
We should be grateful we're getting stuff like this.  GRATEFUL.
---
Adrenaline &amp; MoM
---
what lmao
---
That last paragraph is true, but damn, once Hide or Die and Hunt: Showdown hit console and become widespread,  the DbD team is going to have their work cut out for them.
---
Clowns cooler than hag!
---
The Cure
---
that's wrong because you call it so? People take ruin MOSTLY for points. you can't even tell if there are people close to the hook or not because you can simply get into a locker or run distortion. you might know where one guy is but this guy is probably where you'd expect him - on the other side of the map - and probably will be gone once you get there.
---
People said the same for ds, but that people still uses it, because it is still a good perk, the same will happen to MoM if they decide to add the change, it will have a counter play for the killer ( should i attack the guy protecting the other surv? ) and it will have a high risk high reward instead of the low/no risk high reward.
---
Why should you buy the hag? Isn’t she a basic killer everyone has?
---
I tought of the WIYFSM? one but tought it was to long..
---
I cant wait for more maps I cant throw my hatches on.
---
woah, the eyes are gorgeous
---
As odd as this sounds, I want this as a poster for my room. One of the best pieces I've seen.
---
I used to be a killer main and iron will, Lithe, q&amp;q and dance w me would screw me over in chases SO BAD. They vault a window, double back around the gym and hide behind a tree or something. Or did they?? No tracks, no noise, no hook. Then post game chat be like "omg how did you lose me?? U so bad lul"
---
Iron will
---
Hag is a purchasable DLC
---
Yeah. But these two deaths in-movie might them be a nod to Halloween then.
---
Face camping isn't a thing, it's just the survivor sucking at loops and the killer just doing their job.
---
hands down this one, easily one of the most powerful perks in the game too, especially against Freddy :(
---
Candyman is obviously the best pick of what's left.
---
I would say killer
---
I have a very stealthy and gen rushing playstyle as a survivor you won't get many bloodpoints like that but the game becomes incredible easy If you use a stealth build and have half a brain
---
She comes with the special edition (along with Doctor), which is the only edition available to consoles.
---
Why did you post this to Reddit?
---
I’m sorry but I infrequently get rekt so GET NAE NAED
---
ikr... freddie was an example of a great man
---
Oh it was back before they reverted the changes. Makes sense
---
I thought it was current
---
Nooo
---
Just a little bit
---
Probably one of the better summaries I've seen on here. I got into F13 after DBD and after it started declining so I never got to really enjoy it. But I still had a lot of fun and I bet having all friends makes it insanely fun.
---
Yes, the only SF mindgame. It's not exactly new or unexpected. Good survivors loop the pallet an extra time+ because they are expecting the respect. The second loop gets a pump fake, then usually its a hit to break bloodlust. It's net about the same value. Really good survivors can still get the SF to proc, but they are way better than me. (Those are usually 3k+ hours) It's amazing to see, truly.
---
Seems like you should concentrate on gens if that's happening.
---
This is so lame, I feel cheated from the add-on. It's like they tell you this ice cream has strawberry, this one has orange and this one has kiwi but they're all just almost the same flavors with slightly different artificial sweeteners and dyes
---
*just a little bit*
---
ty :)
---
He should be training get off your ass and run a lap
---
Just a littl- *explosion noise*
---
I’m glad Legion is fucking dead and you can’t convince me otherwise.
---
good question...i think most are salty they get found and downed so fast but I have to say I dont mind being the first person found. Ya know why, because all of the pallets are still up :D
---
Not even if a battle pass is released
---
If you have steam then buy the game, it only costs £5.83 (if you have dead by daylight already) which would almost equal the cost of buying auric cells (unless they let you buy it with shards)
---
im sorry but i infrequently get nae naed so PERISH
---
He will probably cost the same as ash and bubba.
---
All gens were done. I booked it, cuz f that shit
---
The double pallet I saw was on the Thompson house in a jungle gym.
---
We're tired of paragraphs.
---
*uno reverse card*
---
In before
---
Survivor rank or profile level?
---
Before I got into this game, F13 was my favorite game to play. Since I've gotten into this game, though, it's only really fun when I play with a couple friends.
---
Started off a killer main. Solo survivor main now. Killer was by far more stressful and challenging.
---
‘I’ll kill you that way’ I think you might be thinking of. Band name is the slash street boys
---
If you have a commodious box with wire spool and instructions, it can go through almost 5 gens. The instructions are extremely valuable, you just don’t see it.
---
uno add 2 cards card
---
Sprint burst 🙃
---
I don’t main killer but when I play omfg does this make me want to die
---
They probably wouldn’t want to make that explicit of a reference to Scream.
---
I can just imagine hiding in the isles, seeing the killer walk past mine and me luckily surviving.
---
yea which is stupid imo
---
NO GOD PLEASE NO
---
I agree
---
You're ignoring reality here. Please go watch literally any high rank killer stream and count how many times they ask "why am I not in a chase?" despite clearly meeting the conditions for a chase.
---
Jokes on you you’ve just unknowingly handed me 2 *uno add 4 cards* card
---
All you literally have to do is click their name and the Steam profile opens.. it's obviously tru3. 3k+ hours, huge page of comments, save avatar.. and his Steam name is never Tru3
---
It’s our garbage
---
they do, because not seeing anyone no longer means "they are all around and are about to bomb the hook". now it means "they MIGHT be around OR in lockers" AKA you know nothing
---
Im on PS4 and I got both for free. Probably due to the ps+ offering months backs
---
Bad advice
---
Console players smh
---
Wait I'm a console player.
---
But I also dont really care
---
Meh, I don't get the typical reddit Tru3 bashing that I see on this sub. Pops up every now and again.
---
Dude usually has pretty fair and well reasoned points about how the game is played, and actually plays well enough on both survivor and killer.
---
All threads like this do is feed more attention to him. But I guess that's part of what shitposts are for.
---
Damn I can’t unsee it. It takes a real lack of skill to make people confuse Nea for Benny.
---
yea i got that add on and was thinking wtf am i gonna actually use this for?  
---
i guess traping people in the basement sounds pretty sweet
---
New desktop wallpaper incoming
---
Wow it’s cool that we have the first 4 characters from Terrordrome at the top in the game already. Besides Ghostface I sure there’s more to come as well.
---
I've never seen that before.
---
You can still by a hard disc version thru Amazon, I did so back in November for my sons PS4 for Xmas.
---
What a wonderful DBD-centric copypasta.
---
Why has everyone forgot about Jeff ;_;
---
Yes defiantly. Not to mention if you’re just not doing well as a killer it just turns into 4 bullies bullying a nerd.
---
Hecc yea then
---
Exactly and it only cost me $19.99
---
With free 2 day ship
---
Edit: typo, IPhones bs spell check programming
---
Nah dude
---
 On the 12th day of bloodhunt the entity gave to me

AND A SHIRTLESS DAVID ON THE TREE
---
happy anniversary you toxic fuckers, from an equally toxic fucker :)
---
Edit: I did an oopsie. Its totems burning now please don't hate me.
---
Camping is a legit strategy.. just not a good one.
---
There is also a bug when you are picked up or hooked it can disconnect you from killer happened to my brother and his gf alot when we play
---
I played against him a few months back, he was the Huntress. Got 0K and started calling us out because we were a "toxic swf" "full of luck" when we were just well coordinated solo survivors. His chat was full of people telling him we sucked, etc. whereas he was the one who made mistakes. He spent way too much time trying to chase a survivor who was obviously good at looping and it got to him.
---
 I used to think he was a decent streamer to watch. Too bad.
---
Online always has the best game prices. Places like walmart and gamestop wanted 39.99 for the physical game. Retail sucks. People in /r/gaming argued with me about gamestop being good but they literally will hike the price of a 34 dollar game to 59.99 and pretend that it was on sale before.
---
Thanks I am!
---
At some point it's not lore wise anymore
---
Doctor is good at finding people so try to loop him on pallets and make him abandon you for spirit walk when she is phasing she can only see scratch marks and nurse lose line of sight as quick as you can
---
Are they really? I haven't been keeping up with whatever they've been doing since September so all I know is some rework drops today
---
Is that actually attention to detail or just spending 1 second thinking about it?
---
Well clown was also athletic and still is really strong and fast according to lore
---
I don't understand why Behavior made an entire store and character model just to use it for one trailer for one killer. Maybe it could be the survivor and map for the next chapter?
---
The general way to counter most killers is to waste as much of there time as possible by pallet looping. 
---
Pallet looping is where you run around a pallet with obstacles to force the killer to chase you around it. When the killer is close enough to hit you, drop the pallet and use it until they are forced to kick it which will give you enough time to create distance and find another pallet. 
---
Although you may not escape the killer, you waste their time by forcing them to chase you which allows your teammates to do gens and help you escape the trial. 
---
Here is a vid to help with looping;
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFJeojqiTGk&amp;t=4s
---
Now for the specific killers;
---
Doctor
---
- Although Doctors ability allows him to easily find you, the best way to counter him is to pallet loop.
---
- His power does not help slow your movement speed or end chases faster so you can utilise pallets and windows to their full potential to force him into wasting time chasing you around them. 
---
- You can use the perk Calm spirit to stop yourself from screaming. Its a teachable from Jake. Perk is not great otherwise as its only good against the Clown and Doctor. 
---
- His shock can be used to stop you from vaulting or throwing a pallet down if he hits you with it early. If he is aiming his shock at you try to make a sudden change in movement to throw his shock off. Since you are new it's unlikely that you will meet many docs that try to block your actions as that's a relatively advanced killer skill and takes alot of practice to master.
---
Legion
---
- Legions frenzy is not lethal. Although it harms you with the deep wound and makes you stay injured, it cannot down you and if he exits frenzy he has a long stun time which can allow you to cover some distance. 
---
- When hit with Deep wound, mending and being in the killers terror radius stops the deep wound bar from falling which means its unlikely you will go into the dying state from it. 
---
- When a Legion chases you with frenzy, try to run in the exact opposite direction from where he is chasing you from. If you are lucky he will run out of frenzy before he reaches you and suffers a large stun allowing to make more distance from him.
---
- Do not use pallets against a frenzying Legion. Although you may stop their frenzy, you waste a valuable pallet against a killer power that cannot down survivors. Its much smarter to leave the pallet up so that you can use it later on when he is chasing you outside of Frenzy as you will much more vulnerable.
---
- Looping him like any other killer works. Just make sure to stay away from team mates if you see him as his power is based on punishing survivors that stay close together.
---
- Avoid using perks like Self-care around him. He can injure survivors easily meaning healing against him can be wasteful. Would only suggest healing if you are with another survivor or you have a decent med-kit. Using Self-care will waste alot of time.
---
Nurse
---
- Nurse is one of the hardest killers to play and complete counters looping. 
---
- The best way to counter nurse is stealth or blocking LOS.
---
- While running from the nurse try to move unexpectedly and keep LOS blocked from her. If she cannot see you then her blink is rendered relatively useless unless she hears you or predicts your movement. 
---
- General tip is to use Iron will to mask your grunts of pain as that can allow the nurse to track you and/or hide from her LOS and move unpredictably. If she cannot see you she has to guess where you are. 
---
- After her blink she fatigues meaning she cannot really see anything after for a few seconds. Use this to your advantage by blocking LOS right after a blink to help hide you from her.
---
Spirit
---
- Her power allows her to go invisible and travel at fast speeds. The only drawback is that she cannot see survivors and instead relies on sound and scratch marks left from running. 
---
- When outside the spirits terror radius you can hear a whooshing sound effect which tells you she is phasing. During this her original body will stand still and then teleport to where she phased too.
---
- Whooping gets louder the closer she is to you. You could spot her if grass moves without you walking past it as her body still interact with the environment as she phases.
---
- When in her terror radius you cannot hear her phase meaning she will look like she is standing still. She could be faking it or actually phasing. Kind of have to guess.
---
- Best way to avoid her detecting you is to walk. Walking leaves no scratch marks and makes little sound. Running will leave scratch marks that lead right to you.
---
- Avoid walking in corridors or areas with narrow paths. She still has collision while phasing and if she detects you blocking her path then she will know that a survivor is in the way. 
---
- If you are injured then your only hope is Iron will. Because you make grunts of pain you have to rely on her not being able to fully track you via sound. Its unlikely that you can escape her phasing unless you cover alot of distance from her original body. Make sure to heal whenever you can against spirit or bring Iron will.
---
It's not, but please, explain to me *why* you think so.
---
First of all, perks, level up people and obtain the good teachable perks, however that takes time and effort, so for the meantime, heres a few tips and tricks to help for the now.
---
Pallets are your best friend sometimes, loop a killer around a pallet and then drop it at the right time to stun them and get some more headway in a chase
---
Same thing with windows, minus the stun, you can either fake going into a window and keep running to make them lunge attack and miss, or you can fast vault and make them hit the wall (though bad hitboxes make this sketchy at times)
---
Killer shack can be an infamous loop spot when you learn to run a killer around, so keep that in mind.
---
When you do eventually get to obtaining teachables, nea’s balanced landing, david’s dead hard, and a few of the other exhaustion perks can give a real good edge in a chase if needed
---
*Cough* Also Detective Tapp *Cough*
---
So was Bill, Amanda, Tapp, etc.
---
Play how you want.
---
That said, you should play both sides, you'll probably figure out what's fun to play against  and what isn't.
---
It's there to use how ever you feel fit. How you gonna tell people how they should use the perk. Dude you need to take a chill pill.
---
They could shorten the name in some way as a refference like, scary movies or favorite movie idk
---
Dinner and a movie is a start.
---
One thing that you are absolutely not allowed to do is body block a survivor into a spot where they can't get away and then just wait there indefinitely, because that is considered holding the game hostage and is bannable.
---
But to be clear, doing this for special reasons and not to just permanently trap a survivor are still valid, like if you're Doctor and trap a person you can keep them trapped as you shock them to full madness. Or as Myers you can keep them trapped while you stalk to tier 3.
---
Dead By Daylight, as narrated by Charlie Kelly
---
Only problem with that is no one pips and might not safety pip since both killer &amp; survivor need to interact in order to achieve a pip or even a safety pip. Everyone says do the gens, get your points and leave. Well on PS4 allot of people are doing the face camp and it really fucks the hole game and makes it a hook simulator game. If it was once in awhile I wouldn’t care.
---
Hey op, mute messages :) 
---
Anyway, after you hook someone, don’t be afraid to run around for ppl. You’ll get more points overall, and sometimes ppl don’t get as salty, but with that said, more will anyway. Apart from the face camping, just do you and not overstress it
---
We’re gonna get music for ghostface, so that’s a step in the right direction
---
You probably won't be able to buy him with in-game shards since he's a licensed killer
---
I would *Mori to see that?
---
That's not how a lot of Leatherface players use camping as a strategy though (in my personal experience). The ones that do camp generally just stand in the corner with insidious where they won't be easily seen or straight up face camp. Though I'm not complaining about them playing like that. I just agree with the thought that they forfeit the right to complain about genrushing by playing like that.
---
Why can't it just be getting a 4k to get the acheivment
---
I mean, you can use it however you see fit. You can also throw down a pallet while the killer is on the other end of the map. Both are stupid uses of a good tool.
---
No, I think if anything, *you* need a chill pill. I'm calmly discussing misuses of a perk, and I think you're just irritated that I'm calling your playstyle of choice stupid. Don't be so sensitive.
---
Doctor: Finds you but doesnt have a reliable way to down you, loop him
---
Legion: Can injure you for free but needs to M1 to actually down you, don't heal (stay injured) and loop him. 
---
Nurse has no counterplay, you can try to juke her and/or hide from her, bad Nurses can be abused easily though.
---
Spirit: When she stops running you start walking, she cant see you when phasing so if you dont make footstep-noise and dont leave scratches she has to guess your position. Also focus on making distance.
---
Except the reverse when he gets a 4 man and all the survivors are crying
---
Take what you can.  Give nothing back.
---
At least F13th was fun for over a year, Last year didn't last fucking 2 months.
---
I wouldn't say Hunt: Showdown is a competitor to DBD, and Hide or Die, we will see how that turns out.
---
I'd like to know too tbh because Puppers's gameplay is painfully average for someone with over 6,000 hours
---
Honestly, whatever helps the game succeed. If they are still making lots of money, let them ride it out. It gets around some of the kids and whatever as well. If they implement something that makes more money in game, such as the battle pass, it would be more incentive to push it out free for all players
---

---
Balanced Landing and Mettle of Man. 
---
BL because it enables disgusting BS-loops that shouldn't exist.
---
Mettle of Man because it makes playing any killer besides Nurse and Billy really unfun.
---
It would bring in new players, but I think the majority of the existing community would be sorely disappointed in the quality of those players.
---
Man, i am just here happy we are getting a new killer, no complaints here ❤️
---
Hag because she has Hex: Ruin which is one of the best killer perks in the game. She's also a pretty strong killer because she can use her traps to both cut off loops and apply map pressure.
---
That’s what i thought, and it would also lessen the wait times.
---
The first perk might have to say that if you used Deliverance it wouldnt work.
---
I feel you! After your post, i looked through my old screenshorts too and smiled, when I saw that I did the same. A screenshot from my first prestige (https://imgur.com/a/blyhrJG). Thanks for the good old feeling! :)
---
If they just have rights to the mask, does that mean BHVR can do whatever they want with the body?  I don't think their current model is really based on anything.
---
I just saw people giving you shit for the first version of this.  Poor guy, lol.  I think you're doing great!  Keep coming with the memes, you'll only get better. :)
---
Survivor has the harder basics (low-tier survs often suck at looping, routing their chases etc.) 
---
Killer has the higher skillcap.
---
How long does the aura reveal after using mettle of man last?
---
Getting hit by a killer then show his/her aura sounds great. But it need more than 2 sec. Alert perk is great even while getting chased. When a killer break a pallet or gen. It gives me an idea where is the killera next move.
---
Nah it already wouldn’t work since deliverance gives you the Broken effect
---
Damn Carl🤨 Fuck it up!
---
Same here! All though I do see why people tend to complain over this being called a chapter rather than a paragrahp, but it's content never the less!
---
Just imagine the army of Claudettes entering  in the fog.
---
infinit at full health
---
If you’ve read enough books, depending on if there is a change in perspective, a chapter can almost be just a paragraph, but called a chapter.
---
So BHVR can still call this a chapter.
---
So its either pay to progress real fast or get fucked until you have enough shards to progress more? Im on pc so i dont have hag unlocked, ill pay for hag and by the time i level her to 40,  ill probably have 9K shards for spirit.
---
Because they've been advertising it as a Chapter (Killer + Survivor + Map) while it's actually a Paragraph (Only a Killer)
---
Getting a kill or 2 would be fine and the devs even said that a 2 kill is considered a good game, sadly in red ranks that outcome will almost always depip you so getting angry at that is fair.
---
Dude, Thank you!  
---
This is exactly what I was looking for!
---
I wasn't aware **at all** that Frenzy couldn't down you so that came as a suprise, I also didn't know that Spirit couldn't see me when she was Phasing.
---
I'll be sure to watch the video you linked since I'm open to all kinds of guides and tips to make me better at this game!
---
And lastly, thank you for confirming my suspicion as a noob, that running caused scratch marks. Since I would always just crouch or walk around since I always thought that scratch marks appeared otherwise!
---
So, Thank you. Now, **Collect your arrow**
---
Lol GameStop, yah the place that rips you off, those assholes were selling PS4 refurbs for $50 less than what they cost new in the store for at Walmart! they only came with the remote and power cord and that was it, no manual, no charging cord, no hdmi cable and no earbud mic like what a new one gives you in the box. That made my decision on where I was buying a PS4 for my kid real quick. Walmart got my money.
---
Oh yeah, I understand that, but from experience, most games tend to die out in terms of content, so I am just happy that we are still getting new things :) 
---
With that said, I don’t over stress like most people anyway, and I understand that we can’t always get want we want all the time :p
---
What country?
---
Ahh that really sucks, but oh well. I think Ghostface will be an awesome killer to play and play against!
---
Damn. Well worded response. I agree
---
Adrenaline and Mettle of Man. These 2 combine to make the killing life absolutely miserable these days. 
---
Mettle on it's own isn't really so bad, but when you have at least 2 survivors every single game running it, with 3-4 survivors running it happening more and more frequently now, and no way around it, it makes getting kills before all the generators are completed just absurdly difficult. Then when you combine it with at least 3 survivors running Adrenaline every game, it's just too much for most killers outside of Billy and Nurse to be able to handle a lot of the time. This past month has easily been the single worst month I've had as killer in terms of fun level in my games. Even the pre-nerf Decisive Strike meta was easier to deal with than the Adrenaline-Mettle combo.
---
My build is:  
---
Decisive Strike - for tunneling  
---
DH/BL - Usually DH because it's more fun and consistent, but I use BL when I feel worse; it's a better perk overall.  
---
Adrenaline - I feel gross using MoM, so I picked the 2nd best alternative(imo).  
---
Hope/WGLF - Hope is a fun perk that's really good at end-game. We're Gonna Live Forever is a nice perk for bloodpoints.
---
Upset wasn't the right word but eh
---
You're making yourself look stupid here.
---
I'm simply stating my own opinion, and providing reasons why. Don't like it, don't comment. Or at the very least, provide something more interesting than "BUT I THINK THE PERK IS INTENDED TO TAKE AN EXTRA HIT"
---
Don't waste your time responding, I'm done trying to explain simple concepts to you.
---
Hell yeah, my dude
---
Damn right
---
That said, this is a dumb idea.
---
The issue is that the ranking system is intended to prevent camping, but it doesn't. What used to happen is most campers would eventually reach a rank where it was ineffective. Most players just realize the ranking system is stupid, and campers will camp anyway. Now they don't rank up and camp against players who either don't know how to deal with it or aren't equipped to deal with it. It just exacerbated the problem it was designed to help.
---
Yes he is
---
I love getting ash obsession using rancor cuz I hate ash mains
---
Where you giving the killer a handy?  Is that why you didn't want to look?
---
 *Play with friends!* 
---
*...*
---
oh my god i never knew this LOLOL.
---
I hope they make a comic or YouTube series or something for DBD to explore more of the lore
---
There is those survivors that keep staying around even though its apparant the killer is camping. And then complain about the killer camping and how toxic it is.
---
&gt;Nice build. Is deliverance worth it though?
---
I am solo queuing so, yes. Countless times I reached struggle before my immersed teammates had the balls to unhook me.
---
Getting my Deliverance up is my first priority in every match. 
---
By unhooking myself without requiring a teammate, I deny a lot of pressure for killers. After being hooked, usually someone needs to leave a generator, travel all the way and maybe even heal you. 
---
If I unhook myself, thats 60s worth of generator progress I can make while being protected by DS and before someone else can heal me (broken status), unless the killer chooses to chase me. Then he will down me, usually get DSed and then another chase will begin but he won't be able to catch me just yet because MoM will be up. All of this while the other teammates mind their own business (hopefully doing gens). 
---
Basically a 1v1.
---
More often than not I reach end game without being hooked which means deliverance + DS + MoM are very likely to give me a escape.
---
Naw. It's an achievement, a challenge, not something you get for being basic.
---
I swear to god, I am in love with those skins. I just need it in my life. I already dreamed about it.
---
By that logic then why is Adept Survivor simply escaping? 
---
It's not a "challenge" it's a nuisance. Like I said, it's a killer achievement that isn't even in the hands of the killer. PURPOSELY extending the game because the survivor team you're facing sucks is not a challenge. That's an annoyance. A survivor quitting because you're winning is not a challenge, yet it robs you of the achievement. 
---
The requirement is fucking stupid now, 4K made way more sense. That's "a challenge", while also being in the hands of the killer. You have to do so much extra shit to secure a Merciless now and, again,  its in the hands of the survivors more than the killer. That's not a challenge, that's unfair and unfun. I shouldn't have to let chases go on forever to secure a pip, while simultaneously keeping pressure on gens (without any help from good perks), but also making sure that I'm wasting enough time, but not too much. It becomes a chore, not a challenge.
---
Ah, you're looking for the Survivor Rulebook. Here it is:    
---
1. Hooking is questionable, but mercifully allowed, just try not to do it too much.  
---
2. After a person is unhooked, you must give them 5 minutes of total immunity.  
---
3. If you hook somebody, but see another person right at the hook, you must pretend they are invisible and walk away.  
---
4. You are not allowed to use the Hex: No One Escapes Death perk.    
---
5. If a survivor jumps off a hook on their own, you must leave them alone until they heal.  
---
6. You must always give the hatch or the gate to the last survivor.  
---
7. If one or more survivors disconnect early in the match, you must let the other survivors farm points for 25 minutes.  
---
8. gg ez baby killer.
---
I approve
---
I wish that were the case when I solo queue, but there's usually one teammate that breaks and causes it to snowball.
---
the plague over babylon well it may be from Nergal he was god of war and plague also underworld he spread the plague and attack babylon when marduk was not there
---
Mettle Of Man.
---
Almost every farm map has 2 harvestor/cow tree spawns (barn does not) and it's 50/50 which one spawns. You used to be able to get 2 harvestor or 2 cow trees but I believe it was changed where it is one of each, because cow tree has always been much stronger (even though *both* were infinites at one point). 
---
Harvestor is almost a guaranteed hit without Balanced Landing. Hopefully there will be a day where the Entity Blocker mechanic can safely be removed and harvestors will be a better tile. It sucks that Bloodlust and entity blockers completely destroy the balance of certain tiles.
---
I use people as bait, if that's what you mean? I'll down people and let them bleed for a bit to draw people closer. Then I'll track another down and do my best to hook them.
---
If I'm The Trapper I try to hook people near rooms with a lot of windows/vault zones so I can set my traps up there. If I'm The Doctor I try to hook them in zones with a lot of cover so I can hide nearby in treatment mode and hit them with Shock Therapy when they help their friend down.
---
Killer perks are supposed to be 4x stronger than survivor ones, thats why bbq does more than just be a survivor pudding
---
Thanks!
---
Really nice thinking. Will try it.
---
Gen rushing isn't a strategy, your objective is to do generators when not pressured by the killer, so you do that when you can. If the killer doesn't pressure the map well, you have a ton of free time to do gens. There is no "rushing" involved, please tell me what is the difference between gen rushing and doing gens normally.
---
What else are you supposed to do, loot chests? You can do that after the gens are done.
---
Tunneling is only going after one person all game till they die, literally going tunnel vision after one person. It's not a very effective strategy most of the time, you don't put too much pressure on the map.
---
&gt;a survivor not looping well enough
---
Tunneling doesn't imply that you WILL go down, you can get tunneled all game and still survive. 
---
Plus if you get tunneled off hook, I wouldn't say you did a bad job looping, since most of the time you don't get enough distance to loop anything if you get downed right after the unhook.
---
‘Murica
---
Did I read that sentence right??? Did it refer to Nancy as a guy? lmao
---
I paused at that moment because that’s gonna be me when the DLC drops :)
---
I played during the grind. You don’t see that many people with legacy because they have given up if it wasn’t for the new players we wouldn’t have a game. 
---
But I get your point &lt;3
---
ill have to give this a try ty :D
---
it can go with any build tbh, but UE won't help you in chases at all if you're playing against a competent killer + UE is really strong only against Hag, Huntress and Plague

---
&gt;what are your thoughts on the proposed changes to Mettle of Man?
---
Gotta wait for the PTB and see it in practice. How viable will it be to get stacks from protection hits. 
---
MoM needs a rework but not sure this is the one.
---
i guess that helps considering those are 3 of my 4 most hated killers to go against, the other one being billy ahah
---
COME BACK HERE
---
You need 4 Iridescent Emblems AFAIK.
---
My favorite part is watching their broadcast to listen to their salt with their SWF. "This guy has got to be stream sniping."
---
I know it will never happen because of the maps but a guy can dream :/
---
It’s a okay game
---
Oh Jesus Christ!
---
AND YOU BETTER LIKE THE DAMN VIDEO
---
That seems to be 2seconds more than I run on a daily basis.
---
It's not supposed to stay up there forever. Just the fact that we were top three is good news. People love Ghost Face, and if they even Google the game they'll see Michael Myers, Leatherface and Freddy Krueger in a fun, thrilling survival game. 
---
This is excellent news.
---
Low tier. People are learning that her power and a majority of her add ons are countered by simply not cleansing.
---
If survivors don't cleanse she's effectively an M1 killer and in the current meta M1 killers suck.
---
To be fair the mori is pretty funny
---
Found the sensitive soy boy killer main
---
you also have to understand that many survivors define "camping" and "tunneling" in terms so broad as to to be meaningless. many of them will call it camping when the killer is anywhere within 40 meters of the hook, or returns to the area after an unhook. this despite the fact that killers only get counted off if they're withing 16 meters of the hook, AND no other survivor is within that distance, or if they arent in a chase. 
---
I've also sat and listened to survivors who bitch about being "tunneled" when they get found and downed several minutes after escaping the hook. meanwhile, the scoring system removes points from killers if an injured survivor manages to heal. and It's usually more points than I'd lose from the "proximity to hooked survivor" reduction that I'll get from hooking someone, kicking the nearby generator, breaking the pallet they dropped a moment before going down, checking the area for a few seconds after heading across the level. 
---
and many survivors aren't willing to take the risk of being seen by BBQ. and that's fine; but if all 3 survivors don't take that risk, and I see no auras when I hook somebody, then I know one or two of the others are nearby. why should I search 3 miles away?
---
To be honest there ain’t much you can do about slug nurses. You can be found popping a gen, working on a gen, or attempting to pick someone up. So it’s pretty much a loss unless the nurse just sucks.
---
I actually play survivor way more than killer though. So I can see both sides(equally bad at both). Its just how I chose to play. 
---
Thanks for your support!
---
When i read all the stuff about the sexual harashments Ochido did on underrage girls (asking for nudes) i was utterly disgusted.
---
I dont really dislike No0b3 but i hate the fact that both him and Ochido are promoting toxicity in DBD and attracting a lot of toxic people in the game. I can guarantee you that 80%+ of the people that are toxic in this game are fanboys of one of these two (i guess ANGRYPUG's too). It just sucks that this kind of toxicity is promoted in game by streamers and the game becomes so unfun to play.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Why does the killer need to play fair? The goal is to win.
---
Huntress is free on all other platforms, why would they change that just for switch, its probably legion and plague you'll need to buy.
---
Im pretty sure you can get 1 gold and 3 irridescent. I think the criteria is that you have to double pip AND get a 4k in order to get it
---
But then she's effectively an M1 killer that insta downs
---
 *Self-preservation is paramount, at any cost!*
---
Dead hard is a crutch perk? Well I'll be damned. Killer can just I dont know wait.
---
Glad you think killer finds you = instadeath after waiting for fucking ever to get into a lobby is good game design.  
---
Dbd killers aren't scary because the people usually playing them are sweaty manchildren adhering to consistent meta, never changing tactics and always playing the same.  They're PREDICTABLE.  You can almost guarantee on going against BBQ, Ruin, and Sloppy Butcher.  Most only target one person at a time, use their power in a routine pattern, and proximity camp.  It's easy.  It's predictable.  And it isn't scary or threatening.
---
Tldr; pressing the killer button doesn't magically make you scary and threatening - get some fuckin skill and be scary, don't presume you inherently will be.
---
The way to get Merciless is to get iridescent for all 4 emblems. You might not need to due to your lower rank but its a general rule of thumb. Especially for the higher ranks.
---
The best way to do that is to;
---
- Allow survivors to save each other through a match. Even if it involves letting a survivor go while chasing them to unhook its the best way to ensure you get the iridescent emblem for devout. 
---
- Try to keep as much control over the gens as possible. The slower survivors progress through gens and the more you kick them, the better the gatekeeper emblem is. 
---
- Try to get into chases with healthy survivors. From memory, the best way to level up your chaser emblem is to end chases fast and to get a lot of hits during chases. To do this doing a lot of damage to healthy survivors during a chase instead of tunneling down injured survivors should help with the emblem. 
---
- Make sure to kill all survivors. This may seem impractical at times especially with the hatch but I do believe it is quite necessary for the merciless killer result. Because your rank is relatively low, the ranking system may not be too strict with the emblems so you may not need to get 4 iridescent. If you want to do all your adept achievements its best to do it at the lower ranks as its easier.
---
&gt;not thong quinton
---
I used to watch him all the time thinking he was the best killer but as I saw more of his streams and not his YT videos I realized he’s kind of a baby when it comes to this game and losing in general
---
.
---
Those issues can be fixed with some mumbo jambo to his size, and it makes for interesting animations when vaulting (the pig and legion are smaller and actually put effort in vaulting instead of just walking to the other side). Something that it makes me think about is his playstyle since he physically relies a lot on sheer brutality and mauling everything on his way, even tho he's able to supernaturally track it's prey and follows a queue format even after being killed, which gives a lot of room for obsession perks.
---
Most of his gimmicks come from the effects that his existence take on the summoner, the way he becomes more alike to his current summoner as times goes on without fulfilling his mission (the same happens to the summoner,), etc.
---
Overall, I can't think of an interesting power for him aside of an evolution mechanic as the game gets longer...
---
Don’t lie. You only play leatherface. ;)
---
Holy shit. I just wanted to say thank you so much for this write-up! I'm not as new to the game as OP (a few months in now), but this is really informative and helpful!
---
Oh thank god. It looks like at my rank I might be able to get away with 2 golds as on 14 sections are required to get a double pip.
---
cloak of separation would actually be op on the killer. If you find a survivor before the survivor finds another one you're gonna get a really rough neck massage
---
Even tho the layout could be visually appealing, gameplay wise it would be either Hospital 2 or even worse, The fucking Game 2.
---
in what fucking universe is quinton a top
---
Honestly carl, or any cashier, could be really cool since his perk could be store-products based.
---
It's not for everyone. I have 3 friends who exclusively play survivor because they dont enjoy killer.
---
In comparison to survivor perks they are pretty bland, it’s why everyone uses the 4 decent ones.
---
Ugh.... at least use your cakes and streamers first. And drop purples for people.
---
just had a similar experience where a killer took me to the open exit gates, let me crawled all the way to it and then moried me on the spot. at first it was funny but then i thought 'oh, why would you do that?'
---
Imma be real here, I've seen a lot more Ghost face's during Halloween than Michael Myers'
---
The only reason why a killer carrying a survivor would come close to the locker in the basement is because it's a Trapper and there's a trap downstairs.
---
Same with Nurse blinks.
---
It’s hard to take someone who is mainly posting anti-furry shit in r/drama seriously tbh.
---
It makes me happy seeing this game get recognition at this kind of magnitude :D
---
Monto is a good guy though he jokes around alot and chirps himself when he fucks up.
---
fair enough. though I have to point out that in the age of Mettle of Man, the best strategy for most killers is to tunnel non-obsessions, in order to avoid wasting time on someone with MoM. a lot of survivors on this sub don't like hearing that, though the results seem to be proving me right.
---
I like how THAT is the part of my comment you took issue with lol
---
I wish there were more MEPs and AMVs for this game.
---
how can i be a “sensitive soyboy killer main” if i’m not even a killer main lol
---
I also see camping/tunneling accusations a lot from people who don't vacate the damn hook after getting unhooked. I'm sorry, but I don't care if I just put you on the hook if you're the only one there, and you're still standing near or right under the hook. You're going back on. You should have left the hook.
---
If I get back to the hook and the rescuer is there, I'll go for the rescuer instead, or I'll slug the guy who was just unhooked and leave them there while I chase the rescuer. If they get picked back up, it's not a big deal, but if I win the chase with the rescuer and come back to see they're still there, it's just too bad.
---
It's not. If anything it's more likely to be a reference to Dexter than Halloween. 
---
P.s Dexter should be a killer in DBD.
---
well,i pmayed a tonof ti e as learherfa e and i have never camped the entire sacrifice process
---
Let’s take away ghost face and get the new survivor instead
---
BHVR 100% bought that spot. I mean #3 trending with 700k views? lol
---
And that gives you an excuse to screw over your team?   
---
No. It doesn't.   
---
Just because you don't like playing against it doesn't mean you can just leave 3 people out on a rope. I hate the hag, but I will still be there to unhook the David who ran no mither.
---
We still need a ton of other characters added to the game, just to mention a few we need Jason, Candyman, The Bee,  Pennywise, or even Henry Warden, not to mention Little Killers like The Leprachaun, Chucky, or Sam. And THAT'S not getting into the more animalistic killers like The Thing.
---
On top of that, we could see a bunch of cross overs like something from Resident Evil, a Necromorph, or (god help us all) Freddy Fazbear.
---
AND THAT'S NOT INCLUDING all the original killers BHVR is no doubt wanting to put into the game just because they think they're cool.
---
We don't need a "Freddy, but slightly different". New Nightmare can be a skin.
---
Fuckin thanks dude
---
You deleted your other comments but leave this one? Why's that?
---
Killer mains are a salty and vindictive bunch, can confirm.
---
Wat
---
Feels like im watching a “funny” moments video
---
Pig = Upvote?
---
"I'm tired of only giving you guys hope."
---
People say Freddy's great at tunneling and while it is kind of true, I don't think he's better at tunneling than anyone else. He's probably worse because the unhooked guy has to go through the dream transition and will be vulnerable AFTER the unhooker becomes vulnerable.
---
I used to tunnel with Freddy alot but I started instead returning to the hook to sleep the unhooked guy, but then target the unhooker instead. Tunneling sucks when it happens to you. (It's a valid gameplay tactic though, especially if you're going after a Dying Light obsession but I quit using that perk often due to the difficulty in actually pulling it off in a reasonable timespan. Often by the time he's dead the gens are done even if I tunnel as hard as possible) 
---
By sleeping the unhooked guy, you prevent him from wandering off so you can't track him for later while he works at full speed, or awaking the unhooker if he's already asleep which means you're down TWO asleep survivors. Best case scenario the unhooker is awake so you sleep both the unhooked guy and the rescuer and thus half the survivor team.
---
But the Freddy we have now isn't the same as the old Freddy.   
---
There's like 3 Freddy's.
---
Scary Terry - 4. There's 4 Freddy's
---
how would you know he is camping and not just patrolling tho? it's really only swf that cry about this because they know exactly where the killer is.
---
The Hag isn't stupidly overpowered though...
---
And I've got a lot of time in this game and I very rarely DC. I really don't care what anyone thinks when I DC against an iri head Huntress.
---
Thank you for your addition.
---
No, a friend gifted him to me though when he gifted me the game.
---
I've had a perk kicking around in my head for a little bit. It would show your current emblem status above your perks. And then give you a bonus based on which emblem has the lowest score. 
---
 if you had low lightbringer it would give you a repair speed bonus for example. And then post game it would give an extra 1k blood points for every iridescent emblem you get.
---
Yes, also the time-space doesn't flow naturally in the Entity's realm. That's why we have multiple multi-leveled Claudettes in some trials. We could be playing as a Survivor that lost hope.
---
I dunno why Freddies often tunnel. I do return to the hook often so I can re-sleep the unhooked guy (and the rescuer) but prioritize the rescuer as he'll be vulnerable first. Maybe I've lost my "bite" but nowadays if I hit a guy off the hook I simply slug him and run away because being tunneled sucks when it happens to you, and by just hitting him you still punish the rescuer (He gets a unsafe unhook point/emblem penalty and no WGLF stack) but without making life super miserable for the unhooked person.
---
I agree. Games are taken too seriously. Grr
---
You right.   
---
I main killer, and the only way i'd to this now is if a survivor was insanely toxic. 99% of the time if they find it or it's near the hook, they get it.
---
What? It's not hard to figure out a killer is camping..
---
Clearly you do. You are replying.
---
Even the stars refuse to shine.
---
I gotta say, that situation is tilted too hard into the survivors' favor.
---
It does.
---
That's kinda the key. It's a competitive game. If your competitive game depends on one side 'playing fair' instead of playing to win, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Certainly. I think DS is balanced now. If anyone thinks otherwise, they're just salty bastards for all I care.
---
It looks like he just threw the knife over head and it landed perfectly.  I'm loving this image so much\~
---
Well right, I'm not saying that Ash as a survivor should have that.
---
But The Deadite totally could have, where his melee attack is the chainsaw and then he gets the Boomstick as his ability.
---
Your....*ghost* face?
---
Shop smart, shop S-Mart.
---
That’s the point, the game bugged out
---
A good Myers mask is much more expensive than the easily mass produced ghost face mask.
---
Myers needs a full mask with hair and a spicific set of features, while GF is just the front, and can be punched out of plastic.
---
You must have both games in your steam library. 
---
Once free weekend is over, it goes away.
---
711k is a lot, but it's not as massive as it once was.
---
You shouldn’t play so selfishly, because you ARE forcing people into that game where you are avoiding objectives to let them bleed on the ground.
---
I’m a fucking idiot my bad
---
It’s the type of people this game attracts.
---
To add to this if you have BT or legion's stab active on you MOM won't activate (even if it's charged) until you mend it away
---
Survivors just get mad when they have to fight a killer who doesn't let them win, or goes easy.
---
Adrenaline, DS, BT, &amp; WMI.
---
What kind of jouvenile counter is that? You mentioned how I was screwing my teammates over and I was saying that I don't care what *they* think of me. I was explaining to you why your comparison with Hag was wrong, and why it's not important that I DC because there are very few matches where I DC compared to others. Why don't you have a go at some more mental gymnastics? :)
---
Dead Hard + Iron Will + Adrenaline + Plunderers Instinct
---
The last one I switch off to whatever I’m feeling. Lately I’ve been enjoying plunderers because if I live it’s like getting an extra prize 😂 and I love hoarding items so...
---
Doesn't change the fact that there is usually more Ghostface's running around. 
---
Good reason or not, in THAT way, he kinda does fit the title. He owns the streets on that night presence wise
---
You're welcome :)
---
Decisive Strike + Dead Hard + Adrenaline + Borrowed Time
---
I usually get chased a lot so my build has a lot of focus on that with DH and Adren. DS for teammates farming me or late game unhooks. Borrowed Time to save the Baby Dwight. I usually take a medkit to make up for the lack of SC, but I don't find myself missing it too often.
---
I don’t use it, but it’s a super strong perk, even at red ranks. 
---
Look at it from a killers perspective, they are tall, and having someone sneaking around with urban is much more difficult to see. And urban allowing you to crouch around walls quickly can easily get around the killers vision. It’s just really good
---
Great detail by calling it Lery's memoire!
---
Who ever said I wanted to be taken seriously?
---
&gt;Or as Myers you can keep them trapped while you stalk to tier 3
---
False. Myers will lose all collision if he starts to stalk someone. This is to prevent this exact situation from happening.
---
What he says when someone subs. It's not actually what he says but it's what it sounds like. A lot of jokes are made about it.
---
Just leave you don't have to sit and wait while people comment in chat
---
The survivor get hurt and its one less hook for them typically if u get downed as a survivor ur most likely going to be hooked immediately which most survivors aren’t bothered by its when u “down them and use them as bait” is when its toxic and it ruins the game for said downed survivor. U probably won’t receive nasty message if u didn’t down and bait like u said u did
---
Username checks out
---
That is the objective, though, isn't it? I let one bleed to draw out another, hook the second one and, if they haven't saved the first yet I go get them and hook them too. 
---
I try to lay traps to catch others before they can rescue them, or toss out shock therapy to get madness stacks.
---
How else are you supposed to play the killer?
---
But what.. is it.
---
reread your comments before posting pls
---
Yep you’re absolutely right my dude, altough i would respect it if the survivor had been teabagging the killer all game
---
I wish I was eternally stuck at low ranks
---
“If I'm The Doctor I try to hook them in zones with a lot of cover so I can hide nearby in treatment mode and hit them with Shock Therapy when they help their friend down.”
---
This is typically what most survivors see as camping and is also deemed toxic and will 90% of the time ruin the game for survivors
---
I mean sure.. it’s a legit strategy.... it’s just also a bad one.
---
Its not fun. Im trying to get my rank as low as possible and Im just fuckin stuck lmao
---
That's why I love SWF. Unless everyone's running altruism perks like deliverance, we'll make it, borrowed time, dead hard, etc we just let the killer play scummy and rush. Sucks for that one person, but there's no reason to fight stupid with stupid.
---
So what should I be doing then? I'm not trying to be sarcastic, I'm just using the tactics I'd use in F13. I down someone and go after the first person who comes running to help, then go back for the person on the ground (if they haven't already been rescued). 
---
What should I be doing alternatively to not seem like a troll?
---
That baby got me outta more jams than a fist full of lube onna Saturday night
---
Prepare for two years worth of Teabags.
---
Dont down them and let them bleed out, that ruining the game for the other survivors. Hook them instead ull find the game being more fun as well. Ur getting messages for that reason.
---
It's not trending due to the video having 700k views. It's trending due to the rate in which the video is obtaining those 700k views.
---
Please don’t misuse the word literally. The killer could have gone after the Bill when he was in clear sight. He could’ve checked the exit gates after he hooked. Hell, he could’ve run around in circles swinging his weapon for no reason. There are dozens of possibilities the killer could’ve done. He was not “LITERALLY” restricted to face camping. The game did not restrict his movement to that one square and the chainsaw button. He chose to face camp. You may say it was his only logical move (I don’t agree) but it was not the only literal move he could make.
---
got it ty &gt;:)
---
Complaining about flashlights in 2019, LUL.
---
I'm just upset because for the two years I've been playing the game and wanting him in it, I hoped we'd get Sidney and a map. Besides for the MTV show that came out a few years ago, Scream is dead. I was really happy/grateful when I heard about it, I was bummed about the robes but I could deal with that I suppose. And I get the rights are different for the films and the mask, trust me I'm not delusional about that. Just hoped it would be the whole package.
---
that guy looks like human shrek
---
no idea why they wouldn't DC if they knew the mori was coming as a SWF
---
Okay, I'll try not to wait around for people as much. Thanks.
---
No prob fam, not sure what your rank is, but it’s super common to see the perk at red ranks
---
my point is that swf are salty they can't fuck with a camping leatherface and then twist it like they didn't know exactly what was happening the entire match.
---
Okay, I'll skip to step 2 of my usual approach then and just hook them + trap the area. Thanks.
---
Bamboozled again
---
Wasn't that the joke tho?
---
I wish they gave us a new survivor as well as ghostface. But atleast we're getting new content.
---
#JusticeForCarl
---
Fair enough, I did misuse 'literally' when writing that. My entire point is just that survivors shouldn't be surprised or complain when a killer heavily patrols the hook as, unless it is very far from an exit gate, the killer's overall options for adding pressure or downing survivors are significantly more limited.
---
Rank 15 is the sweet spot
---
We still don't got Bill
---
She can deal with MoM, unlike majority of others killers. But the rest is true.
---
I would recommend watching youtube.
---
These are who i watched and it helped me learn, the games pretty simple. I wouldn’t play it like f13 cause those are different games all together.
---
[monto](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMontologist) 
---
[noob3](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-6CA78zz_ZBl1vvJs5cWlw)
---
I know.
---
That’s most of the content creators though. I’ve seen big ones rip apart a killer for every mistake they made after a 4K. The person doing this has a friend that made a tutorial on how to play where they said “you’re not supposed to win every game” so it’s extra ironic. 
---
Can’t win.
---
behold! \*opens the curtain and shows rank 90\* oh- whoopsie! Now behold! \*That image\*
---
I'll give those a watch, thanks.
---
But im just tryna get my rank lower 😔😔 i just started playing this game a lot more and wanna work or rank but im just stuck here
---
55%solos , 29% duos, 11% trios, 5% squads  
---
I didn't misread the statistics, I know there's duos and trios, it just don't bother me, most of the time people just wanna play with their friends.  
---
ah, the survival rate goes up by 8% from solo to 4 man SWF
---
Its called a 3 gen strat. I have to admire the perseverance
---
There it is.
---
I know it's like people forget about this amazing perk. Been using it a lot lately and it definitely helps, plus you can find out if they are using nurses calling, bitter murmur, or bbq
---
Gen Rush - Viable Strategy
---
Camping - Viable Strategy
---
Difference? One takes coordination with a team, at least enough to not get caught and to get three or four gens online at near once. The other one requires the opposing team to not be fucking braindead. Camping works because you keep going to save the person on the hook after the last time didn't work. When you see one person get hooked in basement, then you watch as a second person gets hooked in basement - DO NOT GO FOR THE BASEMENT, WE WILL BE INSIDIOUS CAMPING. IT IS BLOODY OBVIOUS. If you fall for this after the first person did, it is your own fault. Keep doing generators or search for the Hatch if you have a Skeleton Key.
---
Sincerely, a Leatherface Main.
---
Kate's head is so perfectly on the neck it looks like it wasn't even edited. Beautiful work.
---
As annoying as it may be it's a valid strategy. If you don't want it to happen, don't 3 gen yourself.
---
We knew about Ghostface for weeks now but never anything about a survivor. So of course we want to hear something new.
---
Its BHVr’s fault
---
♥️♥️♥️
---
They got the license from the halloween store that sells the costume, not Scream the franchise. That's why they can't add Sidney or a new map. They don't have the license to do it.
---
9. You aren't allowed to hook a survivor with a bear trap on.
---
yeah neither tbh, i do lean towards a bit more of the survivor side but have been playing killer more recently
---
&gt; If the killer wants to troll or talk shit I couldn't care less.
---
wow you really are new
---
Oh, when I know I’m going to prestige a character, I will burn through all my BP bonus items and bring purple items to drop every match, but once I run out of the BP bonus offerings, I prestige regardless of the items I have left.
---
I don't get why you're being downvoted. Kevin Williamson was very much inspired by Halloween. There's a heavy nod in the beginning when Casey's dad tells her mom to go to the McKenzie's.
---
What’s scummy about slugging? Isn’t the purpose to win?
---
I let survivors win at times, but I try and grind as many points out of them. Chase them down, lose them. Hit them, chase them, hit them, hook them, run off. Keeps the game interesting until last gen, then I do 3 Gen Rotation or just wait somewhere and Chainsaw Dance out from a hiding spot
---
It's not required by the killer to ensure the other players have a good time though. As a survivor, you should be fully expecting the killer to want to ass blast you any way possible,  since they are the boss of the match so to speak. You know, as a killer should be. But regardless, it isn't toxic to kill someone by messing with them very briefly before hand.
---
Can confirm
---
I mean to be fair, logically speaking, she had absolutely no reason to leave since the generators were so close together 
---
She’d be essentially giving up a massive advantage by allowing herself to be lured away
---
I feel yah. Sometimes I’m just tired of looking at all my shit. Lol
---
Entity blockers are there to deny infinite loops. With certain perks, certain loops are impossible to counter.
---
This needs a Deja Vu soundtrack
---
?
---
Hi, I would like to say - All of us are toxic because we can be. I main LF and Myers, so I have serious gameplay, then I have "Fuck it, I have been dealing with idiots" and Insidious camp as LF.
---
theres a reason hes called daddy myers
---
a boring copycat wuss of a killer gets generic copycat skillz; very fitting
---
r/woooosh
---
Anybody want some free Karma?
---
Yea but I like to see the stats, the survivor builds, and maybe send a screen shot to my friends
---
Nah, I just don't get bent out of shape. They can do whatever they want. Doesn't bother me. Only time I actually get a little angry is when I think someone is legitimately cheating. Which has happened maybe twice.
---
Strategically,yes. But is winning a single round really that worth it that you would rather stay in a game for over 40 minutes?
---
It’s the only way we defend ourselves from merciless slaughter tho
---
It’s more toxic tbh. Tbagging is rude and all but most of the time it’s an opportunity to get more hit points.
---
Some people are very competitive.
---
Yeah thanks. Was wanting to get some actual discussion not just "your team didn't do all gens in time you don't deserve a free escape, entilted survivor player". A thing most people don't get this game is this isn't a true team game, like say in LoL.
---
Win or lose, all 5 people on a team get the exact same result (on LoL). In this game your points and whether you pip or not is purely based on your own performance. It's beneficial to work together to win, but not required and doesn't always happen. At least when you aren't 3 or 4 man SWF. More so talking solo here.
---
So when you get games were one person dc's at the start, next survivor dc's when they get downed first time and final person suicides on hook and you are playing solo. 3-5 gens left, solo player survivor is alone then killer finds hatch quickly and the survivor has little to no chance to get out. Does that survivor deserve a "free win"?. No. But they also don't deserve an almost free loss. Situations like this aren't all to rare, sure they don't always go down like this but just an example.
---
Maybe I didn't explain my thought process well, maybe people didn't read it all or whatever reason. Just shame as wanted ideas to making this situation a little more possible for the survivor instead of near impossible, ended up wasting time.
---
I absolutely love this artwork, well done!!
---
She is not too good. You need to use her Apple add-ons, or good survivors will never give you Corrupt Purge. Or they might cleanse on the other side of the map, making you wasting too much time for getting Corrupt Purge and Corrupt Purge has a timer, survivors might just hide or counter your Corrupt Purge with high walls loops in that time, making your Corrupt Purge worthless. With the right perks and Apple add-ons, she's mid tier, but she would need some love.
---
Closing the hatch is fine. Doing it right in front of a survivor? That's just dumb. Remember adrenaline?
---
It's fine to close the hatch, but if there's one survivor left, just hook them and be done with it.
---
Yes, and here is the thing, it stacks quickly. One person gets stacked into two, then you can generally leave it be for a minute or two and nobody will come by. Once people see the first person bite it going to basement, they fear for their lives or they think "I am a total badass - Nobody will see me!" and get Chainsawed. Honestly, biggest IQ play I saw, the LF was facing the corner by the door, and let the dude get the two people off the hook. He proceeded to chainsaw and run into all three. Pretending you are AFK works surprisingly well.
---
I think that's just the nature of it being an asymmetrical pvp game. The side that has multiple players inevitably gets more variety of things to do, because there's more players to do them. 
---
There's always going to be people that enjoy one side more than the other. Some people hate playing survivor cause they feel that side is boring, or they hate having to rely on teammates doing their share. 
---
I don't think it's important for every one to enjoy both sides, it's just important that both side have enough people that do enjoy them to keep the community healthy.
---
It is number _ now
---
a cake and an envelope.
---
again, sorrynotsorry. by the time I was able to confirm they weren't that skilled and consider going easier, it was basically over. the rank screen merely confirmed it was worse than I thought.

I hope they make him look like a human in game 😍

I mean i dont consider it toxic when im blinded but i do consider it toxic when they click it 189 times after stunning me with a pallet
---
OHH YOU FUCKED UP
---
it's a bullshit salty survivor meme that twists perspective.
---
Upgrade your PC poorboy
---
In my opinion, all the DLC is worth the money as every killer brings a new power on to the table for you to play with while the new survivors bring new skins and new perks you can experiment with. 
---
This is going based on how good the killers/Survivors are and perks you get from the DLC
---
Haloween DLC is great as the survivor has a good perk (Decisive Strike) and Myers which is a fun versatile killer. He even has his own custom chase music.
---
Of Flesh and Mud is a really good killer DLC. The hag is a really strong tactical killer and has some great perks, namely Hex: Ruin and Hex: Devour hope which are both strong perks. Ruin is very popular for killers as it helps slow the game down for them. Survivor is not the best as his perks are relatively weak and his best perk is currently on the shrine of secrets meaning you can effectively purchase his main useful perk for free this week. 
---
Sparks Of Madness is a good DLC. The doctor is a relatively low tier killer but some of his perks are quite good, namely monitor and abuse. The survivor has 2 good perks which are useful and are relatively popular. One more so than the other.
---
Leatherface DLC is one of the best killer DLC for perks. BBQ &amp; Chilli helps with the grind of blood points by boosting your bloodpoint gains and gives you map readings of survivors locations to help initiate a new chase. His other 2 perks are more situational but are fun in their own way to use. 
---
Nightmare on Elm Street would normally be a DLC I would advise you to avoid as the survivor and killer both do not have many good perks and are relatively weak but the killer, Freddy, is receiving a rework soon so he might improve drastically soon. 
---
The demise of the Unfaithful is a DLC I would not recommend if you are buying for the best perks/killers. Both the survivor and killers perks are relatively poor and the killer is rated to be mid to low tier when it comes to strength in the game.
---
To be fair he's mentioned a few times that he'd like to change it to just Tru3. He picked the name when he was a teen, so it's kinda expected it'll be a little bit "edgy".
---
To clarify I'm not really a fan. I even unfollowed him because of his behaviour. Just pointing out something I've heard him say.
---
sorry for pixilated look, had to enlarge the pic for the doggo
---
Depends on your playstyle. I personally run Bond, Iron Will,Borrowed Time and Self-Care or Spine Chill

I thought that too! I thought you only got the mask if you preordered the game when it came out last year but nope :P it says you get 2 mask (meg &amp; trapper) if you buy the bundle on steam. I played the free trial and have already got the mask somehow? It might disappear when the free weekend is over though. I would love more survivor masks brought to the game too
---
I recently had to take off my beloved Resilience and am using Borrowed, Hope, Small Game, Lithe. 
---
The map rotation of Haddonfield, Lerys, Gideons made me put on small game to find totems and I quite like it now, especially with all the hags and trappers that have come out of the woodwork the past few weeks.
---
That is prime example of douche billy.
---
I completely agree with this
---
Deathgarden aka 2 cosmetics for DbD for the price of a full game.
---
Jokes aside, the game just went through a MASSIVE rework and devs are actively working to make it better, I hope that now everything goes right for them!
---
Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher.

Surveillance, Sloppy Butcher, A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker.

Save The Best For Last, Rancor, Surveillance, Brutal Strength.

Hex:Devour Hope, Hex:Haunted Ground, Hex:NOED, Make Your Choice.
---
A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Hex:The Third Seal, Hex:Haunted Ground.
---
Hex:Ruin, Surveillance, Discordance, Monitor and Abuse + Prayer Beads and Mother Daughter Ring.
---
It’s one of the fixes that the game desperately needed, so much so I actually use it now! Never did before. Still amuses me seeing the odd killer or two still juggling survivors that are the obsession. That’s always worth a giggle
---
Panda is awesome. Definitely one of the more enjoyable streamers. Even when he gets tilted he makes it amusing.
---
Aaaaahhhh right. I would level Hag for her hexes next. For your build based off your options, probably go with Sloppy, Bbq, Whispers and either Knockout/Deerstalker or Haunted Grounds.
---
Depends on what kind of a player you are. Are you immersed, team player, heavy on chases?
---
Thanks! I'll  keep that in mind
---
except that the survivor needs no skill at all, they only need to escape. its actually possible to downrank and escape. you could hide in corners all game and do nothing, then escape because others got the gens done and opened the doors. that's how I did it with David a while back. after all, how am I supposed to do well with No Mither weighing me down?
---
sounds like lag at the best and hacking at the worst though I'm not smart enough to know the diff, but abnormal definitely the chainsaw hitbox is somewhat forgiving
---
So if we think like you , it should be normal that survivors t bag if they're better than the killer or bring any crutches possible, after all they're just trying to survive :)

&gt;You... Got the point that I made, right? It's not about my Pc, but yes of graphics customization, where deathgarden have a way better one.

If it's the game and not your PC then why are you the only one complaining?
---
From memory, the sales are relatively rare, usually only happening during steam events. You just recently missed a sale with dbd during the steam cleanout event. 
---
Most of the killer DLC items though that are not licensed can be purchased using an in-game currency called shards. Shards are earned naturally from playing the game and can be used to buy perks and killers/survivors from the DLC packages. Only Licensed DLC items cannot be purchased like Myers and Laurie from the Haloween DLC.
---
Each killer/Survivor costs 9000 shards. Perks from the Shrine of Secrets cost around 2000 to 2700 if they are newer perks.
---
I think I have lost some brain cells after reading this comment.
---
Yes. That is normal. It’s a competitive game which means innocent teasing and banter is perfectly normal. Even some degree of trash talk is extremely common in any competitive game. 
---
To sit and cry because you got “t-bagged” and then flood this sub with the pointless whining is absolutely ridiculous and far more annoying than a few pixels moving up and down on a screen.
---
I wonder if that can be done again...
---
Not anymore but it used to just fine, pipping system man it fucks the game it always has.
---
Is ochido the man child youtuber?
---
There can be no hope in this hell.. no hope at all
---
uhh hello, Franklin's is banned too
---
So was I. Which is why I used "they" and not "you".
---
Actually speaking about that you might be in luck. The Dead By Daylight anniversary is happening on the 31st of May where the dbd devs are having a special stream celebrating it. 
---
The games DLC could go on sale during that time so I would wait until tomorrow to see what happens. It might not consider a sale just recently occured but there is a chance if you are lucky.
---
Probably. There are good reasona,why he was banned several times from the devs.
---
i think legion is fun to play as... i started playing him alot more after he was nerfed/buffed
---
cringe toesucking whiteknight
---
I think you're a little confused here, bud. What I'm trying to say is that the original poster, who claimed that they would main Legion for this skin, was being hyperbolic.
---
I was under the assumption you were talking about the dude who was like "Wut it's basically the same skin"
---
You... you...
---
**DOUBLE NEA**
---
I had someone "give me the hatch" earlier, only to follow right behind me while I looked for it. Couldn't hear anything over the chase music. Was looking for a good 3 laps of the map. Finally found it, then they downed me and closed it. Such a waste of time.
---
Yikes. I watch noob3 and bricky and thats about it for dbd tbh
---
It’s just that personally, I find his power of “move fast, jump things, hit gives boo boos” boring compared to other killers and hard to balance overall without making it really boring
---
huh, I didn't know that, thanks for sharing dude
---
In a vacuum, yeah, she can deal with MoM.
---
Best case scenario she waits until the survivors are broken to hit them and manages to get them out of the game before MoM procs.
---
Outside of the vacuum you're dealing with Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, flashlight saves, pallet saves, instaheals, survivors taking hits for other survivors, so on and so forth.
---
This is an MoM problem though and not specifically a Plague problem. Still, it has to be taken in to consideration for the time being when rating a killer.
---
One of the devs called him Carl on Twitter.
---
hag devour soap is second best perk don't at me
---
worse for killer, i get consistant 3-4K's as huntress but hardly ever a merciless killer result even if i landed impossible shots and steam rolled them with 5 gens left, its absolutely fucked
---
All I see is something that's your fault...
---
not much with huntress tho, that's like the main killer you 100% need to have eyes on ALL the time
---
*squee* *giggle*
---
The puppet just made me laugh so much, it made me think of those memes where it has that one image of someone face then like a faded out enlarged version of that person screaming
---
My thoughts as a survivor main who very occasionally plays killer:    
---
I like the idea that survivors get a warning the killer has NOED but I think 5 totems go down real fast with 4 people looking for them as soon as the match starts.  Maybe NOED also adds like 0-2/3 totems to the map (amount is RNG-based) to even out the power of notifying the survivors of their additional objective.  Or maybe adding additional totems could be its own perk altogether.  Maybe add another factor to it like cleansing the NOED totem just temporarily deactivates it and puts it on an X second cooldown until it spawns on to another dull totem (this would require testing to find a fair amount of time for cooldown.  30?  60?  IDK).  I like the idea that the entity buffs his boy when he's getting his ass kicked.    
---
The survs can then either ignore NOED, cleanse and try to make saves or get out while it's temporarily safe, or play it safe early and get rid of all of them.  I see how adding extra unknown amounts of totems could be too strong.     
---
That could also lead to buffing Small Game so that it shows how many totems are left on the map in total?  Or add a survivor perk that cleanses totems faster while showing amount of totems left on the map (a sort of mirror to ToTH while giving more map awareness), IDK.  I think it could be interesting to make totems more important.  This could create a whole new totem hunting role for survs instead of just gen jockey, medic, and chaseboy.
---
I’d give gold if I had money
---
His stain was painting your ass red, he looked close enough for a hit but the animation wasnt there. The 2nd hit was perfectly fine
---
I'm gonna challenge that, unless it was a limited time thing, pig is not buyable with shards
---
u/PeterExplainsTheJoke we need you here
---
Nothing wrong here. You just didn't have the time to make it.
---
I’m talking about the big fucking tree in the exit gate for anyone that’s unclear
---
 2.7.0 mid chapter patch:
---
“Fixed an issue that could cause a tree to spawn within the exit gate area in the Backwater Swamp maps.”
---
Ahh thx man
---
You could have just run straight and made it. This is 100% your fault.
---
Seems like the design worked fine then. You wont always get all survivors saved.
---
It depends if they were actually trying to find a match. I get matches typically between 1-4mins after searching
---
Yeah, in the beginning you need as much time as possible in a match. Ruin is almost necessary. Try to revolve your build around delaying the game. I use BBQ, Ruin, and usually, Sloppy and NC. NC isn’t too good on Nurse because survivors figure out you have it pretty quick. Don’t *ever* use it when it’s tier 1 or 2. Tbh, most PC builds work. Pro tip. The broken watch is great. The watch cuts fatigue time by a lot. It basically lets you make *way* more mistakes. It’s only an uncommon so it’s fairly cheap. Cosmetics are cool yeah, but wearing the WW2 stuff or the base is a great advantage. Survivors automatically assume you are bad. It’s like a default Dwight.
---
Also apparently they're already busting out licensed "hunters" with The Terminator.  Bet that means we'll see stuff like Predator in the future.
---
Especially when you're running bbq and chili and the one who DCs is the one you haven't hooked yet
---
Cue several horrible cracking and snapping sounds
---
I love Noob3. I also watch a fuck ton of SxyHxy but I started watching him before DBD was even a thing and before he changed his name to Hxy. Puppers is another good one. I used to like Pug but he gets pretty toxic and obnoxious so I can't really watch him much anymore.
---
Was not aware, will burn the perk, thanks.
---
Pretty sure they said that without dedicated servers it's not possible. When dedicated servers are implemented that will be a feature.
---
If you research before complaining, you would know that they can't do this just yet.
---
They need dedicated servers first, which won't happen immediately no matter how many threads people create about the issue.
---
What? They commented twice, and they also didn't allude to this being hyperbole. What's your point?
---
Bricky is pretty cool, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him mad at a video game but maybe I just haven’t been watching the right videos of his
---
I am glad the devs are trying to stop Ochido from promoting toxic behaviour tbh though. At least they care about their playerbase enough to try
---
Seems about right tbh
---
Ok sloppy, bbq, ruin, and nurses calling got it! Thanks so much for the tips I'm starting to get the hang of blinking (just a lil bit) but I haven't pulled a 4K yet hahah
---
Flashback to legion trailer...
---
They kinda need to otherwise their game would become a complete wasteland
---
"I would totally main Legion if they did this"
---
I mean, I doubt a skin would be the make or break factor in them maining them. Or, maybe they really would.
---
That would make it either hyperbole, or a fact. Definitely not sarcasm.
---
I watch him for the perk builds tbh
---
my shitty ass grammar
---
"Sporty Fleshlight" so a Meg Model?
---
we want carl as a survivor! i mean hes already modeled, easy money for bhvr
---
# research? What the hell man? How many hours and screens do you think i have
---
I know. I said GG to a survivor who escaped today and because I used corrupt perge to down a survivor who was unhooking right in front of me said "You camped no GG for you"
---
It was my first time playing plague, on lerys
---
I'm talking about the fact that you ran around the pillar instead of just going straight. Why the hell would you do that? If you hadn't you would have lived.
---
I just hope they release Sidney Prescott sometime in the future
---
Standard.
---
Why would you run around the wall on the left?
---
Its not like you got chased from a billy or a huntress and you had to dodge a hit, he would have never hit you if you would have went in a straight line.
---
You're ignoring the fact that this could also be read as sarcasm, seeing as it's only one line. You could also read it as not hyperbole and actually a statement of fact. 
---
It's one sentence where you can't hear or see any inflections.
---
Please dont find out. For your own good
---
Twitch and YouTube
---
Just reread the post. 
---
Nice
---
See and that's dumb, but i wont GG nurses because that killer is literally game breaking lol
---
Thanks Ghostface
---
I find that missing a blink raises a survivors confidence way high. They’ll do really stupid things. Hide in plain sight, jump into you, 360 you, and heal next to you. Sometimes you don’t even need to blink to hit a survivor. You are slower than the average killer but you have the same lunge. Another tip, on Console it’s much easier to land long range hits than close range. If they are looping a pallet and you can’t hit them just move away and blink back.
---
100 screens an .0001 hours
---
What did I just watch
---
Tip from a killer:
---
You’ll have more fun if you just play. 
---
When you try hard and start smacking killers with every pallet on the map and other lame stuff like 4 man flashlight crew. 
---
You’ll be your own party pooper.
---
What were they actually reacting to lmao?
---
exactly thank you
---
I dunno man, I think you're looking too deep for something that really isn't there
---
This is incredible.
---
I was kinda like "ok then you do you boo" and went about on my day. I don't think we need a youtuber promoting that behaviour. It makes killers feel like theyre being punished for being killers
---
Logically speaking they would have to right? We know the survivors are aware of one another so I would imagine the killers know about one another even if they don’t directly interact with one another.
---
Okay so that’s 5am for me. Awesome thank you ❤️
---
Well if you stop overthinking, it's also likely not hyperbole.
---
Well you have to remember that this entity playground is it’s own little realm, separate from regular reality. A good example is leigon. If you read his desc, he just wanders into it, even though it probably has never been in those woods. It’s another dimension, if you will, so most likely, yes. Most killers probably have went in the same way and, like the survivors, have abilities to sense other killers.
---
What sounds are you referring to? And also probably not. I'm pretty sure the dev's said that they wouldn't release licenses killers side by side anymore
---
Wait, weren't you the one being defensive because I didn't fully agree with your belief that it was hyperbole, and suggested it could be sarcasm? Yeah. You weren't ready to agree to disagree. Seek help.
---
Its the 4 mans i hate. I dont mind up to 3 but the 4 mans are just bloody awful. I went up against a rank 4 today and I'm drifting between rank 13 and 12 at the moment (perks arent levelled on plague yet lol so struggling)
---
Do-sign.
---
Headless Horseman.
---
Survivor - Icabod Crane
---
Ash when you compliment him for his altruism
---
I believe the Wraith and Nurse have cosmetics referencing each other
---
Ah yes, the "TTV" crew. Many of which want to be Noob3 and attempt to troll the killer.  If only they truly could play that efficiently.
---
You did misread. The recent statistics only showed "How people queued up". It did not say "This is on average the team makeup for survivors".
---
Or in other words saying "55% survivors queued up as solo" doesn't mean" "55% of games are 4 solo survivors"
---
I think there is a point people can reach where they're just being unfair for the hell of it. it's no longer about gameplay, really, they're just straight up being an asshole and abusing their side of the game
---
but on the contrary, sometimes people can go too far in restricting what the other players can do "fairly", to the point the game is no longer fun anymore
---
slugging is a viable strategy, but imo it should be saved for situations where it's specifically useful
---
a killer that is trying to slug survivors the entire game just makes it an unfun experience (and yes, I have encountered people like this before)
---
tactics like this, when used in excess, start making the game boring for everyone
---
I believe the Nurse and Wraith have cosmetics referencing each other
---
Oh yeah that's pretty much it though to my knowledge
---
Yeaahhh the fact a level 4 can play with his rank 6 friends against a level 13 killer is so dumb
---
I’d personally say it’s just shitty to do to the survivor. Playing slug simulator isn’t fun at all and survivors are 100% justified when they say they’d rather DC than crawl around all the time.
---
Fr. What an elitist tool.
---
They can walk over them and escape if they pop it.
---
No, I'm pretty sure what happened in this thread was that I clarified whether or not we were talking about the same person, then once I knew we were, offered my reasoning for why I don't believe it was sarcasm, and when I realised that you weren't willing to budge from your belief, I decided to agree to disagree, and wished you a good day.
---
Rather than take that as a respectful and mature adult, you decided to parrot it back like a 5 year old in an attempt to try to get the last word. No bud, I think that *you* need help.
---
Don't waste your time responding, your stupidity has gotten boring. Take care, mate.
---
Its like its 9pm my guy i just wanna play a couple matches where i can just get a few kills without tryharding. I start to lose all my skill after that time
---
went against this one jane, did nothing whole game and i let the david go after killing her because i cross map sniped him there, if i see a useless survivor and its like 2 guys left typically i target the useless one
---
Hey fair enough! I didn't actually know that, I've never felt compelled to actually try it. In my effort to provide some examples of body blocking having a fair reason, I've exposed my ignorance. Thanks for the correction!
---
Way to rewrite history. Is that you, Trump?
---
Don't forget: "I knew that was going to happen"
---
Lol now do the opposite where he gets a 4k with Insidious and the basement because dumbass survivors play super altruistically even after they know its a Leatherface.
---
Most killers in one meme...
---
Yeah, because no one has done this meme before except you.
---
Then they deleted that part of the post.
---
What Mizuna said, unless specifically stated otherwise most skins aren’t really canon in most cases. Things like the Hallowed Blight skins are different though
---
Pockets full of posies
---
The shirless Myers isn't mine but the actual meme is. If you have a link to one that's exactly like this one then I'll take mine down.
---
I love it
---
Monto and noob3 are much more entertaining. You feel they're having fun when youre watching them.
---
The dev also called him thick and juicy so it’s not like they were trying to prevent these memes.
---
Upvote this post, then link it to steam, then link it to the official forums.
---
No problem, glad to help.
---
Yeah! I can’t believe they haven’t done something like this yet.
---
They never will and my heart aches because of it :(
---
Friday has more potential, more atmposhere and the different objectives give it more variety. It was just cut dead early
---
Are u kidding me 310 hours and didnt notice it
---
Shirtless Huntress would be better.
---
Would buy this so fast if they did.
---
Agreed the tunnels A LOT and gets mad if a survivor has a flashlight (yet he uses mori?), but he's entertaining.
---
Mori me mommy UwU
---
Quitting the game is never justified unless the opponent is using a third party cheat. It’s part of the game and it’s not like it happens every single trial.
---
I cant play the game for more than a few hours without getting a bit tilted, so I feel you lol
---
Well, if the killer leaves them on the ground and camps them, gens can get done. If they leave them on the ground and go away, other survivors can heal them. Either way, the killer is giving up a hook. I think it’s a bad idea to balance the game around uncoordinated, solo queue teams.
---
What do you mean? What's the wrong spots
---
Didn't get the "kill yourself" message but I certainly got the "you didn't save me. delete your game fucker" message in my very first game. I was honestly too terrified of the heartbeat in the game to even know what was going on, let alone understand I had responsibilities to other players.
---
The traps only detonate if someone walks nearby without crouching, so the counter is to notice the traps and slowly approach, followed by slowing crouching away until you've left their aoe. This makes the Nea perk Urban Evasion(crouch at full walk speed) extremely useful if you happen to be running it.
---
Hello lovely folks who want to help DbD science! The chest statistics experiment is going strong! I recently spent 3 hours with friends on KYF and all I got was this ~~lousy t-shirt~~ 220 screenshots, which together with the ones I collected last week and the ones some of you have sent me, means I now have almost 300 non-Plunderer's screenshots and about 200 Plunderer's screenshots. There is thus a deficit of the latter category at the moment. May I persuade you folks to help me with collecting more screenshots using Plunderer's (and, if possible, Ace In The Hole)? (Hey, it's much easier than the other option! 😄) Once both are over 300 the collection phase can be over.
---
Thanks again for your great help so far!

Sometimes I want to but I never do, I'm a slut for blood points
---
I would rather not go against pc nurses thank you.
---
"the icon of halloween" is a trademarked slogan for the ghostface mask, not an actual description. Just like how no one actually loves mcdonalds, despite their "i'm loving it" slogan.
---
Only problem with it is it’s a crutch perk. Killers that NEED wall hacks to find survivors are bad. Survivors that don’t know you can hide behind the gen you’re working on or hide in a locker to counter it are bad. Yet it’s still run on literally every killer for the effect, not just for the bp. 
---
I guess my bigger problem is I hate seeing the same perks every game. 
---
I excuse hex ruin because gens are completed way too fast. It’s a problematic perk because nerfing gens makes the perk op and nerfing the perk makes gens way too easy. They should just remove the perk and make gens harder to complete in general.
---
Possibly have multiple survivors come in; one to distract. If you think it's hopeless, you can also go for the arm wave to let others know she's around. Then they can do gens.
---
No, those two nodes are just replaced by other stuff.
---
She was proxy camping, when I got off the hook she came back and downed me again. I could have ran her for longer if I put down pallet, so it’s kinda my fault. 
---
I’m going to run urban evasion just in case I come against a hag. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
[It’s been like this for too long](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9tgzyh/ghostface_waiting_to_be_put_in_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2)
---
there's a pretty clear line between playing the game and abusing the game
---
no human is obligated to be nice to any other human at any time in life, but it's a fucking lot better when we are
---
this doesn't mean you have to give up playing the game how you want to or having fun
---
I don't condone survivors being toxic or overusing game-changing tactics either
---
my original comment was intended to apply to both killers and survivors, except the part where I specifically mention killers
---
Nonchalant leaning cup included?
---
I like "run like hell"
---
"Peel out" is really strong. I feel like That would be the best exhaustion perk in the game.
---
"Wheelie" is cool, but it feels like a better version of that one Quentin perk.
---
I think his power will stay the same, but he’s going to get the ability to enter the real world once he builds up enough meter, so he will be able to hit people without putting them to sleep.
---
I think the only counter to a campy killer is for your team to rush gens and leave. You'll die but the killer only gets a 1k and barely any points. Might prevent them from doing it again as they'll see it wasn't worth it.
---
This also goes for this entire community.  Nobody who plays this game knows how to take a loss.
---
Yes. [If it can hold on for this long](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9tgzyh/ghostface_waiting_to_be_put_in_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2) I think it will be fine.
---
I don't think you should ask ME about it, I thought about some reasons but i'm not a dev. So I'm not the proper guy to answer you, I'm sorry :(
---
That would work if they didn’t just spam fuck you
---
She had Ruin and they couldn’t find it. I told them to just go through generator. But they insisted on finding the ruin. So by the time they found it, one tried to get me while I had a second left. She teleported and downed him.
---
Yeah, that's what makes it funneh
---
True. I didn't really think of Quentin's perk. If Peel Out was actually in the game I'd despise it since it'd make pallet looping even safer. Run Like Hell is one perk I think is realistic that it could be in the game since it directly counters tunneling.
---
I love this glitch, I’ve only had it happen to me once
---
omg
---
Pepehands
---
Possibly have multiple survivors come in; one to distract. Crouch around traps and they wont go off. If you think it's hopeless, you can also go for the arm wave to let others know she's around. Then they can do gens.
---
Edit: Crouching won't work if Hag runs Scarred Hand, but then she can't teleport.
---
5 gens left, with ruin and SWF team who hate doing gens with ruin. 
---
When I get another team I’ll tell them to do just that, thanks for the suggestion.
---
Reverse order.
---
My favorite is how if a killer DCs, even at the very end of the match, none of the survivors get their blood points. It literally wastes the 15-20 minutes you spent in the match when it's like you never even played it. Shit is so stupid
---
OoO is so funny you just make eye contact with killer and sit on their gens as they hide in the basement watching you
---
I heard, but I never saw where. Though, that means the PTB isn't too far behind.
---
AHAHAHHAAH no. I try sometimes, to get those faces..and then never again.
---
He's not even a real doctor, and I don't hear you complaining about that.
---
It's just strange to me is all, how certain playstyles are considered toxic because they're effective
---
Best way to change him without giving a chance of making him worse
---
2G1C
---
*laughs in oink*
---
why not? i thought it was easier to 360 with a controller
---
Well yeah, they paid for a license. The hype needs to be strong.
---
I know. It's just VERY much likely to killers to face solo survivors with some duos and ocasionally trios with the solo guy, and rarely a full squad. And like I said before, I don't mind it, ppl Just wanna play with their friends.
---
oof
---
Also the xbox version is getting more players because of Game Pass. Hopefully since they are bringing Game Pass to PC we may see more PC players as well
---
aha yes funny meme
---
Freddy's original design was meant to include the trenchcoat from New Nightmare, so I'm pretty confident that they're one in the same
---
Besides, they're not really that different. Freddy showed up in Dylan's dreams before he possessed him, and the movie is still considered canon (despite completely changing how Freddy's powers worked and apparently bringing Nancy back from the dead)
---
Implying that No0b3 actually plays efficiently...
---
On a related note: What else was in that community form thingy again? Seeing as how the battle pass seems to have been in the plans all along, so very well could all the other stuff in there.
---
whats michael’ stun noise??
---
the game was bopped from the start
---
Sony and Microsoft are working [together!](https://twitter.com/pcgamer/status/1130176308061855744) So I think we should be fine
---
(Redhead pinkie intensifies)
