Spirit relies on addons to be good, too much of a notification and not many mind games anymore. That said, shes still top tier.
---

---
Switch Hag and huntress imo. Huntress is a slight bit more effective.
---
Fucking *legion*? Hes mid at best. Sure, hes amazing with shit like mix tape and cold dirt but his power isn't all that great and hes more annoying.
---
Micheal should replace legion though. I feel hes more effective with his stealth and instdown capabilities. His power is made amazing with addons.
---
LF is too much of a chance to hit survivors tbh. I find them running straight through my chainsaw more often than not. His power is an instadown and a slight acceleration with a real bad penalty.
---
Trapper is lower IMO.
---
---
---
I run Lithe because I can't accidentally trigger it. When I had sprint burst, I would constantly use it on accident. Also, it's great for breaking hatch standoffs, especially if the hatch is by a window or in the killer shack.
---
Restart your console. Also, she would appear locked (I believe) if you didn‚Äôt have her. 
---
U/not_queen_bhvr - I know this might not be your area but can you pass the message on??? It would be greatly appreciated if we knew you guys saw this!!! Thank you in advance &lt;3
---
Ignorance! Gamers are the most oppressed minority! By god, what are they teaching you in school.
---
Yeah I just did that I'm gonna take this down tho
---
it'd be pretty weird for meg to switch skin color in one of her skins
---
Ok, did it work?
---
Tis the bee. 
---
You sound triggered u ok?
---
Yeah 
---
Twitch emote theft is easily countered and a very quick way to get your channel's reputation destroyed. Doubt anyone is stupid enough to do that. Last week I saw a streamer get absolutely blasted on Twitter for these reasons.
---
If everything goes on sale, then I might consider it.
---
I MIGHT... be fine with getting everything in the game again. Every single trophy. Every single teachable.
---
It'll take forever... but maybe, in the far future, I'd consider it.
---
Not sure if I'd experience the same LMB issue though. If that ends up being the case, I'm not sure if I'd buy the game regardless.
---
The thought of going up against Tru3 and Noob3 sounds soooo cool though...
---
I know how Noob3 does 360s, I could probably catch him with my own theories on how to hit someone who does that...
---
Nice
---
Everyone says nea is the killer but we all know its claudette 
---
The issue would be swf just loading in and quitting all at once to farm bp
---
Feel free to add me if you would like!
---
Not a good one. It‚Äôs one of the trappers add-ons. It basically downs you if you get trapped.
---
Don‚Äôt be dissing owl boy like that. 
---
A pretty good reason why I run Kindred in pubs even though it's bad. If they choose to check one by one and don't get gen's done. I kill myself and cue for a different game.
---
If they keep running gens while I am being camped, I stay as much as I can.
---
Go ahead and find any comment that remotely infers that XD
---
A yeti and a himalyian temple. Probably not but i really want a beast. 
---
You can use it to rush pass clown's gas clouds
---
Trying to escape a Trapper's trap without help will down you. This is a warning that he's got that add-on. Honing Stone.
---
I think I just came everywhere.
---
Had this happen to me on fathers chapel with Michael, thankfully he was the last dude so I stalked him and used the EW3 lunge to get him, it was annoying 
---
A buff on survivors for a under powered character. 
---
DONT FUCKING DISCONNECT AS I HOOK YOU OR AS YOU GET HOOKED WHEN YOU ARE ON MY TEAM. IT'S FUCKING POINTLESS!!!!!!
---
Rank explains this
---
I bought the game 1 month ago and when I started playing I was always seeing different things and having fun,non toxic killers/survivors etc. Now rank 10 and I begin seeing the same thing again and again,with sometime some variation
---
I agree, I just try to enjoy every match I get as survivor or killer. Seeing as the wait to my next one will most likely be 10+ minutes on a good day.
---
I think people forget that how the killer chooses to play will GREATLY affect the outcome of the match and can possibly ruin it for everyone. A killer that just afks and does nothing is a boring match to play, a killer that just facecamps his first hook EVEN if you counter against it optimally by gen rushing is going to be a shitty game to play for everyone involved, a killer that holds the game hostage by body blocking you or just standing over your slugged body will make matches drag for a long time. Same for slow ass 3 gen strats that drag forever and so on.
---
I'm not saying this shouldn't be allowed but when it's the only match you have within half an hour to an hour as a survivor it's going to be a really shitty time.
---
I'm just genuinely curious, Owl boy is beloved in my household.
---
Thing is though, Killers will then just slug Survivors who use No Mither. And if you get downed... a Killer will just pick you up. You'll never be able to recover, so infinite Unbreakables is worthless.
---
A looper would want the ability to take a hit, not get one hit in exchange for a CHANCE to pick yourself up without any help.
---
Oh sorry then :3 not native English 
---
It‚Äôs not hard to hit them on console. 
---
Sisi tu tira de google traductor fenomeno

All good.

A golden encrusted temple. It could be Indian though too. Hell what temples dont have a little gold?
---
Really? Cool

[Everything they said! Just adding this here for accuracy's sake ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://i.imgur.com/9we7Sim.png)

They're bomb af
---
I guess so
---
The game says team up or go at it alone. You're not required to help others. Just because you're 4 players in a game, doesn't mean you're a team.
---
Just if you feel you can‚Äôt get a game at all, maybe try the other side. 
---
Fix the frames on console and I‚Äôll agree
---
idk, the only playable killer I've got right now is Freddy, and although he is good (in my op), he's kinda boring from time to time, just got into a game with a spirit, made her pretty angry
---
Usually the gen grabs are a result of a survivor looking away, not necessarily because of whispers - but it helps a lot.. Don't listen for the audio cue. You have to watch your perks on the bottom right and wait for whispers to light up and crouch as soon as it does. You can get gen grabs/ambushes without whispers but it lets you know the exact timing to crouch so you don't have to walk around the whole map in super slow crouch mode.
---
Pretty much every DBD game at this point.
---
I'd assume the Entity's torture.
---
I'm fine with it either way, if I'm having a bad night getting great checks I'll go hunt it down and destroy it. If I'm doing ok I'll take it out if I come across it but meh.
---
What pissed me off is I actually had a killer use the survivors destroying his ruin totem as the reason why he face camped us recently. He caught me fair and square, hooked me, and then spent the rest of the time waiting for me to die on the hook. While I was dying, and he was watching, someone else found his totem and destroyed it. When we called him out on face camping 2 of us, the other two finished generators and got away, his excuse was it was because we destroyed his totem...
---
Sigh
---
I DID BECAUSE I PLAYED A LOT OF SURVIVOR FIRST. MY FIRST KILLER WAS LF WITH BBQ 3, WHISPERS 3, SLOPPY 3, AND IRON GRASP 3. IT WAS A LITTLE UNFAIR FOR A WHILE
---
I bought LF just for BBQ&amp;Chili but man the days of Insidious Basement LF were indeed dark times
---
Going at it alone doesn't mean you should crouch around corners the entire game and ignore the only objective 
---
HEY CHIEF, ITS NOT FACE CAMPING JUST BECAUSE I DONT TOUCH MY DICK TO A WALL OK THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MAP. SORRY YOU GOT HOOKED AND HAD 1 TEAMMATE VISIBLY NEARBY AND THE OTHER LEFT SCRATCH MARKS
---
Actually perfect üëå 
---
[Keep him away from grampa](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t0wLnMn7fos)
---
Each hook phase is 60 seconds long. That is 3/4 of a full gen. If someone gets hooked, do half a gen and then for the unhook, go a bit earlier if you know no one else will go for the unhook and/or you are far away. Nobody wins if you hook rush, you give the killer more opportunities while also not making any progress in the game (except the killer, they will probably win).
---
This is my current tier list after 1300 hours in the game. 
---
I feel very confident in this list. 
---
Please keep the comments civil.
---
About 80% of the time I power through it, but if I‚Äôm tired or sleepy I just say fuck that noise. I look for it for about 2 mins and if I can‚Äôt find it I‚Äôll go back to gens lol.
---
I might start putting stakeout in my main perk rotation for those games where I‚Äôm too tired to concentrate on hitting a great skill check. 
---
That's what I thought. Thank you.
---
YEAH I MEAN DISCORDANCE IS A GOOD PERK, BUT LEGION IS JUST REALLY BORING TO PLAY. THERE IS NO SENSE OF REWARD LIKE WITH OTHER KILLERS BECAUSE OF HOW HE DOESN'T REQUIRE MUCH SKILL AND ALSO HE'S REALLY WEAK. I WOULD SAVE YOU SHARDS AND SEE WHAT THE NEW KILLER IS LIKE BEFORE DECIDING HONESTLY.
---
This type of body block might not be against the rules, since he‚Äôs technically killing the survivors. The ruling would be dubious at best
---
I feel like legion is more consistent and efficient if played properly. He can close distance, and end chases faster than some of the other killers. But he still can't end chases as fast as b tier killers. 
---
But why exactly? Because I voiced my opinion? Do you call everyone who disagrees with you in anyway a cunt? 
---
It would also make Gen pulls so much easier and you wouldn‚Äôt even need Pill bottle. I still think survivors should glimpses so it at least has some counterplay. 
---
I disagree, I think the squeal is cute af and I go out of my way to stun her because of it
---
Well. Yes actually.
---
Then you're the cunt (: 
---
No u.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the entity has thousands of unplayable human killers and survivors so I just assumed that her, the trapped guy and dead hooked girl were just somewhere in the fog unplayable by us.
---
Yeah they probably did turn it off. Yesterday I didn't have any trouble finding good lobbies but the day before oh my lord don't even get me started 
---
Based of an Asian story, but the character in the game is black
---
No u...
---
The way you say things can come off in a rude manner. Your comment was one of those and it certainly was intentional. I mean, you literally said who cares.
---
It takes like 4 or 5 stabs to down a survivor, and while he has no counterplay when it comes to pallets and windows, chases are long as shit because you‚Äôll either have to stab them 4 times in frenzy or stab them in frenzy then chase the survivor as a 110% MS killer, which isn‚Äôt fun at all. 
---
Could be changed to Claudette. Besides the trailer had a dead girl on a hook that would be better suited for meg.
---
He's right though. Yeah it may hinder you but he's playing how he wants. Thats out of your control. He's not an idiot for being himself.
---
You‚Äôre a meanie but I see the intention
---
There's a lot of factors. But I find that he can end a chase. Trapper, Wraith, and Leather, can't as well. And he has much better pressure than clown. 
---
There's also moonwalking, which allows him to close chases faster. Doctor needs specific loops to counter chases, and a good legion can force survivors to run where they want them. 
---
This was one of the hardest decisions, and honestly, his placement is still a constant thought of mine. He's a delicate killer, and there's no one else like him. When the devs finish balancing him, his placement will be more clear. 
---
None here.
---
So y'all slug and camp the down person ? I'm confused
---
Okay. I definitely see your point but hear this. This is obviously a sexual thing, no NSFW tag on it, straight on the dead by daylight thread. (There's apparently a dead by daylight gone wild thread where people enjoy getting fucked by the killer and killers like fucking survivors etc) Why wouldn't he post it there? Randomly putting it in the DBD thread is like bapping a dick pic on the ask reddit thread, no one wants to see this apart from the people who are into that little sexual scenario. So of course a large amount of people (My comment got more upvotes than the post) wouldn't give a flying fuck what this fella looks like or what gets his dick hard. 
---
&gt;LF is cheap
---
&gt;LF is a shit tier killer
---
Some people need to pick one
---
You‚Äôre both wrong, it‚Äôs a nurse teleporting
---
That is a good point.
---
whoopi goldberg status
---
Why on earth is that downvoted? Losing faith in humanity. A bigger, more diverse cast is realistic to life itself and a lot more enjoyable. Survivors are basically skins. More variety is GOOD.   
---
Want an Indian girl with a traditional Sari so bad. Please!!!! 
---
I see what you're saying ...but wouldn't u end up getting hit with the DS anyway ? I'm just a little confused on the strategy thats all 
---
He's Italian, but born in Argentina. 
---
Yeah idk man, because there‚Äôs buffing what he has now or reworking a power. If that we‚Äôre to happen though, I think that the Aura reading range would have to change
---
Imagine being hooked and facecamped by Freddy
---
Dwight schrute cosmetics 
---
when did the devs say she??
---
Laughed at this for a solid 2 minutes, thanks OP
---
Lmao 
---
Hag is underrated. She can close loops mid chase making her more effective than Billy and spirit in many circumstances. Huntress doesn't have the map control that Hag has, and her song hinders her from being as effective as hag. 
---
Pig can end chases faster than Michael. Except when Michael has tier 3. Pig also has traps for slowing the game, where Michael spends the early game building tier, only to use and it get maybe 1 person, IF he doesn't get chased.
---
Clown has 0 pressure. He can only close loops. Think of him as a hag, but without map pressure. He doesn't have enough capability to be effective. He's a single purpose killer, that doesn't even do his "end chases faster" power well. Abandon the loop, and he's back to square one. He has the same problem doctor has: he needs to chase survivors to a certain small loop. 
---
Not necessarily cherubs, I'm not very familiar with Inca myth, but I'd imagine they have a god that features wings. I know the quetzalcoatl is a winged serpent.
---
Coming soon to switch!
---
The game has its issues with framerates and killers with bad connection. Even with its problem I have fun playing  it on the xbone. Hopefully I'll see you on there if you decide to buy it.
---
But not a babyfaced angel. That's the thing. It's little angel baby faces.

---
Freddy should be higher, clown should be lower. I respect the hag placement tho.
---
Always figured him for a Nick Jr guy.
---
He is one of them :D
---
That you're about to be bricked 
---
Looks good although I‚Äôd put clown in d.
---
Gatekeeping is stupid everywhere, but gatekeeping something that's only there  for enjoyment, like a video game, just makes you sound even more petty and sad.
---
That or lower lmao
---
ESCAPING ISNT REALLY THAT IMPORTANT OTHER THAN THE BLOOD POINTS BUT IF YOU WANT THE BLOOD POINTS SURVIVOR ISNT THE PLACE TO GET THEM. KILLER ID WHERE THE BP IS AT.
---
Yeaj, but adding time to the Gen won't do anything to make the game more fun for survivor. They just get to hold m1 longer.
---
r/jacksepticeye
---
Damn... why the Meg hate :D
---
Idk if he is Freddy tier but he‚Äôs very easy to loop even with his ablility.

&gt; I wouldn't say any of that. She is good, don't get me wrong, but she isn't more effective as Billy or Spirit because while she has really good map pressure, her chasing isn't as godly as you would think. She has the ability to close loops but survivors can outplay this or play around it.
---
Not really, you wont be able to see the traps and once they are triggered the hag gets a free hit most of the time. Hag is worthy of at least A +, I reckon shes as good as Billy.
---
I'm gonna assume the survivors can run past this chest but it's fat shaming you?
---
Cocky bastard. 
---
Don't tell me yo're one of those people who played Freddy once with double block addons and NOED then called him trash. If so then theres goes my respect for your list as you obviously haven't done your research.
---
Enjoying the memes ofc :)
---
I'm sticking with Nea and Jeff, the best survivors 
---
ds only lasts 60 seconds after being unhooked after its change, so just don‚Äôt pick them up for the next 60 seconds and slug like the fellow above said
---
Haha haha
---
ok let me explain - a new survivor is better than a skin for another one is what I meant by this. also, I meant survivors when I said characters - I just want more diversity in both race and choice! :)
---
He isn't Freddy tier bc Freddy isn't a bad killer, although thats an argument I'm sick of getting into. Thing is about Clown is that camping pallets completely neuters his power, and he doesn't have anything other than chase.
---
Lol. I've been called cheater many times. For some reason they think having skill is cheating.
---
Great list. I agree with everyone one. I think doc should be a bit higher especially with distressing / calm. His shock therapy can actually work on pallets / vaults with polished electron addon but without addons he's very weak. Couldn't agree more with clown. His power does nothing on safe pallets and only really helps for catching up to far away survivors. Basically useless when he's out of bottles. People think that clown is anti loop but they just utilize bamboozle which make them overrate his aftertonic. I think the fact that pig's power is left completely up to chance should count for her being a bit lower. Also agree with Freddy his game stall is very powerful and most people that think he's bad are just bad at playing him
---
Doc on console makes the game nosedive. 
---
I've only played nurse once, so that question, is not a good question for me. Also, my PS4 is brand new, and is really good.
---
Ok
---
Im not referring to prayer beads, I'm referring to addons in general. Read my comment then. 
---
From my experience, he seems to walk slightly slower.
---
Type it out for me so i can use it for Zubs next stream pls
---
Did you really just edit this to circle the barrel?
---
Indeed. Holding the game hostage is a shitty thing to do for both sides. Being frustrated at defeat is normal but holding the game hostage isn't a solution to the problem. Sadly the devs, as far as I'm aware, haven't sent out bans for holding games hostage but I hope they improve in the future 
---
it's not it's just boring 
---
A good console =/= an average gaming computer. Consoles have limitations, of course a beat up PS4 isn‚Äôt gonna do as well as a new one but that isn‚Äôt the point. Console is badly optimized, something the devs need to do, not the companies that made the console.
---
 oof you got me there
---
Enjoy the massive increase in BP gain
---
he's upstairs taking a bath...he'll call you when he gets out. 
---
I forgot to mention that my memory sucks, and I don't play on PS4 a lot. That may be the problem here.
---
Her add ons are not needed. If you are reliant on them, you are most likely playing her wrong. 
---
Her power is balanced in a way, so that cooldown won't kill it. You always seem to have it when you need it. 
---
I'm sure half the replies simply being "fix the game" is really helping 
---
Claudette was white in the original trailer anyway, so they'd both be switched. I think they should just think about reusing the designs.
---
Wow. Someone actually used something from the original Spider Man movie!
---
it doesnt make you slower
---
Is it worth unhooking someone when the killer is around if the they are about to enter the struggle phase?
---
Excuse me, sir. I do believe it is pronounced Bing Bong Boy!
---
i love how you didn't even bother to put the legion lol 
---
Oink
---
It doesn't make you slower at all. When not in a chase and just travelling the map, keep it out and wave it from side to side. You can eaisly catch hiding survivors.
---
It's the icon that tells you to use your phone because Dokkaebi is calling you and interfering.
---
Good
---
I'll deny the points if I can and just leave them downed and chase the other one. Yeah, it's not his fault but I'm not respecting bad saves.
---
If Claudette and new had a child
---
thank you literally couldn't find it anywhere
---
Yeah thats where we are going to have to disagree mate. 
---
Alright Mr trapper I'm sorry
---
I legit did not notice that it was you who commented twice. I tend to not look at usernames a lot, so that's my mistake.
---
You are not slower while "channeling" your power like that. You obviously get a slow down if you tag someone with it. And personally, I feel like when  you activate/deactivate it you slow down by some super lower percentage. That might just be my mind playing tricks on me.
---
But yea, on corn maps especially just charge it up and spin like a sprinkler if you think someone is near. Unlike Myers, Freddys power isn't stopped by corn so you can easily tag someone you don't even see.
---
\___/  \___/
---
*"dead by dayliiiiight"*
---
I'm sure there are people who leave without saying anything but the survivors can arrive at the end game screen slightly before the killer. So sometimes a quick "thanks" or "gg" gets sent before the killer  gets to the score screen and therefore the killer does not see it
---
Behavior has a bigger chance of making a Sari outfit for Claudette than ever making a brown survivor. 
---
Ok. That's fine.
---
I‚Äôm just being honest. I play killer for the most part, but ruin skillchecks aren‚Äôt hard. Genuinely not trying to flex, I‚Äôm just voicing how I feel. 
---
It was satire y‚Äôall. No need to downvote him. 
---
Nope, you're fine. Just survivors being entitled as usual. You get used to it after awhile. 
---
I hate that this is true
---
I used to main him for about 6 months. 
---
this man gives Quentin mains a bad name
---
all 6 of us
---
Did he escape? If he did, he acted correctly.
---
It‚Äôs 1v1v1v1v1- not 1v4. Your goal is to survive. 
---
It seems like one out of every three or four matches I have against Leatherface, someone hides in a locker to dodge his chainsaw, yet they forget about the tantrum he has when he hits an object, so they get out and immediately get downed as he swings the chainsaw around a couple more times.
---
Maybe it's just that not that many people know how to face him.
---
"Fine I'll make my own game! With black jack and hookers!" - Jason

---

---
LMAO yup. Those arguements like 'oH WEeL IM a raNk onE KiLlEr' are so stupid.
---
He was on first hook.
---
What was your go to build?
---
that literally happened to me
---
Sad thing is is that Ruin does almost nothing. It adds about 30 seconds of wasted time, even less if the survivors know how to hit skill checks. Its just the gen speeds that hurt my soul.
---
why does the wrong answer get upvotes?
---
Disagree, Freddy is fine rn. People just don't know how to play him.
---
Id tbag too if i almost escaped jumpscare myers on lerys. One of the hardest matches in the game lol
---
Please tell me you‚Äôre joking...
---
Yeah, like he said, a month.
---
Yeah maybe, I feel like people would get butt hurt about it though.
---
i feel like you guys look for literally any reason to plug that sub. it's in every comment section since it's establishment
---
Be careful of any cheap USBs plugged into your PC. Cheap USB devices often have poor shielding.
---
Alright, now that I see he wasn't on death hook I get where you're coming from. But the fact that he wasn't struggling probably meant he thought you were gonna let him go. Anyways, I no longer think you were completely in the wrong, though I would advise letting them go if they were dead on hook or something. Getting stuck in a tree and getting hooked for free is no fun.
---
Oh ffs im sick of this shit. Freddy is not a bad killer.
---
Hitting great skill checks on console is luck of the draw.  Half the time a lag spike will fuck it up. 
---
They need more people to stare at trappers monster cock.
---
Same to you!
---
no one mentioned console lol

On PS4, the master account shares its DLC with all other accounts, unless the developer indicates otherwise. I'd assume this is how they have him, though I always thought BHVR blocked it.

Playing on console is ez Change My Mind
---
Annnnnnd we found the immersed useless survivor ladies and gents.  
---
Was playing pig yesterday. Had 2 on hook one down and a feng min searching every jigsaw box. I finally found her and noticed her trap beep faster and faster. I just started watching her in the grass while crouched. But she found me, started to follow me. She eventually stood under a hook while the beeps got faster. She was frantically spinning and running in circles as the trap seperated her skull from her jaw.
---
That was the most satisfying game as Amanda. I felt like Jigsaw would be proud. I did give her a choice to save a downed teamate or search more boxes. She chose death. 
---
...
---
I‚Äôm not even going to explain how stupid this is. 
---
Look at ANY tier list, talk to any top tier player, they will all say the same thing, ‚ÄúFreddy is the worst killer‚Äù
---
Hell, I‚Äôll link you to multiple tier lists so you get my point 
---

Look, disagree with Tyde about the rest of his list, Hag isn‚Äôt bad and Michael isn‚Äôt THAT good, but he does explain why Freddy is shit. Btw, these are all fairly recent tier lists so don‚Äôt say something like ‚ÄúOh that was ages ago‚Äù because Freddy hasn‚Äôt been changed in the last 6 months. 
---
Hopefully killers doing this will increase so BHVR will finally see it as a problem. Or they will just ignore blatant problems like they always do *shrug*

Yeah I mostly agree, glad to see people not underrating pig and overrating Myers, because chase aside, the natural effect on slowing (or the exact opposite) the game is something many people overlook when considering how good they are. Yes michael can one shot, but he has a really long startup phase
---
why would killer be salty when it's literally up to him to win or lose lol  
---
survivors are salty cause other survs usually farm and then killer tunnels
---
More like.
---
"Mamma saids I can't come play today."
---
They are salty, end of story.
---
I don‚Äôt blindly follow these people. I agree with them and they know what they‚Äôre doing. You can bitch and whine that they‚Äôre playing Freddy wrong but you are the one whose wrong. 
---
Also, how else do you play Freddy? You sleep a survivor, you chase them until you down them, you find another and repeat the process. You can‚Äôt decide if they‚Äôre playing him wrong because you only have a 5 minute clip of them playing. Bricky has multiple videos of him playing Freddy on his second channel so go watch those and tell me he‚Äôs playing him wrong. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to do that, then I have a take for you. Go to twitch, go to the DBD category, go to the top streamers who are live (Puppers, Scott Jund, Vinc3ntvega) and ask them who the worst killer is. It‚Äôll only take 5 or so minutes in total. 
---
Yeah. It is but i dont really care at this point. If the killer wants to slug everyone for a 4k instead of just playing the game they really need it i guess. I mostly see it with nurse mains and hillbilly mains but it still annoying unfun gameplay.
---
Wow ok. Is this the next picasso, cuz why the fuck is your art not at an art exhibition, yet. Ive seen countless drawings, yet your simple subtle piece speaks a thousand volumes of depth of creative imagination which is limitless and intangible.
---
Picture or it‚Äôs fake ;)
---
Yah I had a game 2 nights ago where I had skill checks every 2 seconds, one after another, after another! I was crazy, I gave up and started gen tapping until 2 gens left and someone found the totem, then to find out it‚Äôs a pig and she was afk!
---
Is this real? Please tell me it is it would be so epic
---
Also shirtless Meyers and  shirtless David are a thing
---
I HAD A MYERS DOWN ME, HOOK ME, AND START CAMPING ME AND TUNNELLING ME, BUT FORTUNATELY A NICE BILL HELPED ME OUT WITH BORROWED TIME, WHICH GAVE ME EXTRA TIME TO RUN AND I LOOPED HIM FOR A FEW GENS, THEN HE GOT ME AND HOOKED ME AGAIN, WHEN THE EXIT GATES OPENED, BILL CAME TO GET ME AGAIN BUT FOR SOME WEIRD REASON HE COULDN'T UNHOOK ME, SO I DIED ON THE HOOK, BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THIS MOTHERFUCKER CAMPED ME FOR 5 WHOLE GENS WHILE EVERYONE ELSE ESCAPED, I REALLY DON'T SEE WHY ANYONE WOULD DO THIS, ALL IT DOES IS DENY ONE OR TWO PEOPLE FROM GETTING A LOT OF BLOODPOINTS, AND IT MAKES YOU LOOK STUPID TOO.
---
This guy......
---
 He gets it.
---
I get it now ...I'm a full time survivor just wanted to see exactly how they helped the killers now 
---
Well yeah you dont play them often so its gonna be stressful for you. Literally as soon as you get ruin it stop being stressful. As long as you can get one hook before ruin goes down its usually ez mode. I made it to rank 1 with trapper only being a survivor main. It was stressful my first 5 ish game but then i realized how easy it was to just semi patrol a hook a win the game because they gotta save eventually.
---
Lol
---
Nobody said anything about slugging all four survivors. Not sorry new DS is so easily countered it basically doesn't exist now.
---
Also, it's not like pig's power doesn't help in chase. You almost always get first hit + pallet games. 
---
But that‚Äôs my point, I wasn‚Äôt using an op build. Wtf would have happened if I was? ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I thought posting nsfw content was against the rules? Wraith‚Äôs looking pretty sexy.
---
Just wait until Freddy puts him to sleep
---

I‚Äôm guessing they brought a game offering and then insta dc‚Äôed to fuck with people but I‚Äôm not entirely sure. 
---
Why are you being downvoted? You just spoke your opinion, that should be allowed.
---
Who stores pizza vertically?
---
Killer mains will ignore this comment lol everytime i go for a save and the end of the game and get caught i always get called greedy...Uhhh what if i just wanted him to escape? Is that not a possibility? Sometimes i know its a death sentence but i usually get enough points from gens and running the killer that ill usually still pip so im ok with dying while i know that survivor might need those 5k points. But im just greeedy. :p
---
He's kinda bad against good survivors. I still think he's mid tier of course. 
---
In white countries. Tell that to the black slaves in Libya 
---
WHY IS IT THAT WHENEVER THE FUCK I GET HOOKED, MY STUPID FUCKING TEAM MATES JUST JACK OFF AND DO NOTHING. GOD DAMN, WE LOST TO A FREDDY BECAUSE OF YOU, YOU FUCKING IDIOT.
---
Like i said i dont really care i never ran DS anyways my problem is just with slugging. Unbreakable stealth buff.
---
For me? Sure, its not fun but I can deal. 
---
For battlerobert1465, 007ruler007, and shadowwolf125767, the &lt;10 hour people who are for some reason on my team at rank 13 and delegated the task of doing gens when the killer inevitably finds me and my "aggressive playstyle" ass first? No deal.
---
or his DUMMY THICC ass cheeks clapping in response to traps being set
---
It‚Äôs in one of the best spots it‚Äôs ever been. This subreddit is ridiculous 
---
I mean, other killers have different strats, too. Nurse is move unpredictably, Hag is gen rush (lel)
---
Trapper is have fucking eyes, legion is disconnect. 
---
It‚Äôs just people wanting to disagree with the majority. The worst part about their arguments against Freddy being the weakest are terrible. They just automatically assume everyone plays Freddy by tunneling one survivor down at a time, which is something no decent player does. 
---
He will be doing the following:
---
1. Find the person he hooked and their saivor.
---
2. Chase and down the obsession.
---
   2A. Do NOT pick up obsession for 1 minute. This is the timer for DS and thus they can't proc it.
---
3. Now that obsession has lost DS he can safely hook him for the rest of the match DS free.
---
After downing the obsession he can just leave him and chase the saivor. 3 survivors not on gens since he is chasing 1, 2 is down, and 3 is getting 2 back up.
---
Puppers has 6K hours so unless those guys have more than 6K I‚Äôm gonna call them bad. 
---
I guess but I kinda like it just for the getting to hooks is so much more convenient and helps me get back to catching survivors
---
Scumpost 
---
Only a suvivor main that can't win without cheating, would say that. Congrats. You played yourself. 
---
Oooo there is a *La Llorna* movie coming out, coulda been a good shot for a licensed killer
---
Exactly. I get 4K‚Äôs all the time as Freddy at purple and red ranks but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm using 2 block‚Äôs with Ruin, Enduring, Brutal Strength, and BBQ. 
---
Probably Tuesday. 
---
I see nothing! 
---
Just as it‚Äôs a choice to go and save a teammate at the end of a match or escape by yourself, nobody HAS to play as a team if they don‚Äôt want.
---
Your personal opinion doesn‚Äôt matter, because the game allows this. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt care. Move on to the next game and forget him. If he has fun that way, more power to him. 
---
I'm going to argue. It's shrek. The picture is clearly and onion.

You should pretty much always make a hook without agitation or iron grasp with hook spawns these days.  I just prefer something to help slow the game down and give me more time to operate and apply pressure accordingly.

This was my first time ever playing with one of the purple mirrors. I'd have taken a 2k, but hey, he volunteered for a 3k!
---
Yeah I guess Ruin or Pop Goes The Weasel would be good 
---
Yup, get that terror radius huge 
---
Aight well join then form your opinion
---
Dude lol killers camp ... tunnel .... And get buffed every week ....win without cheating ? Lol how the hell can u cheat as a survivor lol it was a joke d**k waud 
---
No thanks. I‚Äôve heard enough to form my opinion, I don‚Äôt need to join your circlejerk. The other joined and told me all about it so I think I‚Äôll pass. 
---
Different server bro, the one i sent him to was a hag main server. This is a teaching server.
---
I actually don't think this game would be too bad on console. Sadly, I don't have a PS4 or Xbone. Just PC.
---
Aight you do the same
---
But M&amp;A normally makea your TR smaller. It's only bigger when you are I'm a chase. So when you are not in a chase, they counteract each other.
---
It lags sometimes on certain maps *stares at badham preschool and the ski resort back when it came out* and skill checks are fluent af on console
---
Meh. Unbreakable doesn't really matter if the killer was just going to stop chasing that survivor anyway.
---
Agitation isn't very great in general, and M&amp;A doesn't so much for the Pig.
---
SERIOUSLY FUCK THE RANDOM SURVIVORS ON THIS GAME TONIGHT!!! (PS4) RANK 8-12 SURVIVORS WHO EITHER WERE SANDBAGGING ME RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE KILLER OR THE COUNTLESS GAMES WHERE YOU WORTHLESS SCARED LITTLE KIDS WEREN‚ÄôT DOING ANYTHING BUT HIDING!!! GUESS WHAT I CANT RUN THE KILLER AROUND AND DO THE GENS AT THE SAME TIME!!! IF YOUR THAT LAZY OR SCARRED TO DO ANYTHING THEN UNINSTALL THE GAME!!! 
---
JUST PLAYED AGAINST A SPIRT THAT WAS RUNNING BBQ, HAUNTED GROUND, SPIRIT FURRY, AND RANCOR, I RAN HER AROUND FOR THE FIRST 3 OF THE GAME, NO GENS DONE, I LOSE HER, SOMEONE POPS HAUNTED GROUND, THEY GO DOWN. I START WORKING ON A GEN FIGURING HEX RUIN SINCE NO GENS POPPED, BUT NOPE! I SAVE THE PERSON AND GO BACK ACROSS THE MAP TO TRY WORKING ON MY GEN AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE GOES DOWN. I GET TO MY GEN, SHE HOOKS PERSON THEN COMES TO ME AND AFTER A MIN OF LOOPING FINALLY GETS ME DOWN AND HOOKED. THEN TO MY SURPRISE THEY ARE ALL IN THE CORNERS OF THE MAP HIDING DOING NOTHING, NEXT IDIOT GETS DOWNED, NO ONE MOVES, 2ND PERSON HOOKED, DAVID FINALLY COMES TO THE RESCUE WHILE IM IN STRUGGLE, I RUN OFF TO GO HEAL NOT SURE WHERE HE WENT, 2ND PERSON STILL IN HOOK, NO GENS DONE, I GO TO SEE IF OTHER GENS ARE WORKED ON OR ALMOST DONE, NOTHING, ALL OFF EXCEPT MINE WHICH IS REGRESSING, NONE OF THE OTHERS WERE KICKED EITHER. SPIRIT FINDS ME AND I LOOP HER FOR ANOTHER 2 MINS, (SOMEWHERE IN THERE SURVIVOR 2 DIES ON THE HOOK) SHE GETS ME DOWN AND HOOKED FOR THE LAST TIME, I GO TO SPECTATE AND GUESS WHAT THEY ARE BOTH STILL HIDING DOING NOTHING!!! MAKES ME RAGE I WIIT AFTER THAT AND CALLED IT A NIGHT! SORRY FOR THE LONG RANT BUT THIS IS BS!!! HAD WAY TO MANY GAMES WITH SERVS DOING NOTHING!!! 
---
Oof mate this guy just linked me to this comment. Theres no point going against the hive mind dude, you cant change most of their opinions. I've tried it, didn't work.
---
Myers Tip #493:
---
When the gates are open it's always worth wandering over to see what's going on.
---
9/10 times there will be a cocky survivor teabagging who you can use to build up a nice stock of Evil Within all ready to take back into the map and use to kill his team mates.
---
Seriously, forget NOED I've lost count of the amount of  times I've got an extra kill because of this.
---
Like I told someone else, Unbreakable doesn't really matter if the killer was just going to stop chasing that survivor after they slugged them anyway.
---
How about both? Instead of Agitation and M&amp;A.
---
Honestly Freddy isn‚Äôt all that bad of a killer, he‚Äôs viable at high ranks. Still the worst that we have currently but not all that bad nonetheless. 
---
It could come in handy though but I see what ur saying
---
I thought Alex Jones was revealed to be in the Monster costume for a hot second
---
Its better than being slugged lmao
---
Yes, he isn‚Äôt as bad as people say, but he is the worst. 
---
People get butt hurt about a lot of things in this game so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. This can be rationalized as not *completely* different from slugging, but man having a 4 man slug fest sucks
---
The game easily can tell. When people enter a lobby together the game just needs to remember 4 user names. Seems doable with the gigabytes of ram they have in computers now.
---
The Mummy.
---
Wow! A BRAND recongiz E a sda kafja aup43134p
---
I regularly change up my builds between killers and I have one survivor with all the perks that I just mess with different builds. A lot more fun. 
---
I love when she helps me with generators. 
---
Monitor is actually super good on pig because you can get so much closer to a gen before you have to crouch 
---
Are those the Entity's claws?
---
M&amp;A does a lot for the Pig you can get so much closer to gens before having to crouch and it speeds up getting to gens so much 
---
I agree. I don't want games to go faster for killers in the low ranks, but games go a little too fast for survivors in the higher ranks. Unfortunately I have no idea what they could implement to counteract this problem.
---
i bet the rank 2 raged quit
---
You shouldn't encourage doing nothing the entire game 
---
LOL
---
GAMERS *RISE* ***UP***
---
How do I take this the right way because you ended it with I eliminate the African...uhhh
---
Shove it Negan
---
I meant a part of the map XD sorry for such a late response
---
So True!
---
Here‚Äôs my opinion on tiers:
---
S+: Nurse
---
S: Billy
---
A: everyone fucking else
---
B: Freddy
---
This is a game where knowledge and comfort matter a ton. At top tiers of play, you‚Äôll see a lot of killers do spectacularly. Nurse is at the top because nurse, billy for map pressure and movement speed, and Freddy is at the bottom (slightly) because of his power‚Äôs limitations. It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs bad necessarily, but the lack of a way to interact with survivors without that definitely hurts him (like endgame he doesn‚Äôt necessarily get a ‚Äúfree secured kill‚Äù for downing someone)
---
I will never *not* argue that tiers are almost meaningless for killers in this game
---
Yea my bad urban does nothing but unless she is using prayer beads you can hear her right?
---
Claudette, Adam and Tapp... and no one plays Tapp cause they kinda did his model dirty and his cosmetic choices aren't good. What's wrong with wanting more black characters? Killer ethnicity hardly counts, as you barely see yourself when you're the killer, and you play killers for their powers. Survivors are literally skins. 
---
TO THAT FUCKING GARBAGE LEGACY DWIGHT THAT KILLED THEMSELVES ON THE HOOK BECAUSE THINGS GOT TOUGH, I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT WE DID THE FIVE GENS WITHOUT YOU AND ALL ESCAPED TOGETHER
---
Likely felt it would be unnecessary. A lot of Survivors will panic and save themselves in that situation, rather than risk the rescue.
---
Don‚Äôt let OP see you 
---
People on this sub really hate LF, but like he destroys pallet loops because he forces pallets even better than billy, and his major weakness is that his power is useless if they window loop. He‚Äôs definitely not OP, but damn dudes realistically midtier
---
I GOT CALLED A TRYHARD 4 TIMES BY THE SAME SURVIVOR BECAUSE I GOT A 4K
---
HE CALLED ME AN INBRED NIGTARD CUS I WAS PLAYING HILLBILLY
---
Yes, also the award amount is really small for the price of cosmetics which I understand why but it kinda sucks.
---
And the survivor is there to survive, so get over it if you get decisive striked. It feels cheap sure, but thats how it is. get over it and move on to the next game
---
I feel like Hillbilly could be placed along with Hag though. I don't even have 1/10 of the hours you have so I might have not met terrifying Hag players. But I sure am terrified of Hillbilly's map control and insta-down capability. Quickest hook I've ever seen so far was like... 40 seconds into the match?
---
...And yeah, a veteran nurse player is literally the most terrifying killer I've seen. How foolish I was to think her slow move speed will give me more chances at living.
---
well it is so ya better shell out the cash
---
uhhhhhh.......dude wtf
---
Very, VERY good choices. Maybe reconsider Monitor and Abuse for something to help in a chase (e.g. Brutal Strength, Enduring, etc.) but otherwise very solid. 
---
Horrifying 
---
I...don't think you know what sensibility means.
---
Is this a mf One Punch reference!?!?
---
I was thinking dropping agitation for enduring/brutal strength but Monitor and Abuse really helps getting closer to gens before crouching it saves a lot of time 
---
It's not Dwightlivery-- it's Dwightgiorno
---
I have seen some mentions of fps going down when looking at things like fire, but this is on all maps. It's still technically doable, but when you get the really early skill checks, there is absolutely no hope for you.
---
It's.....a..rock?
---
Did he camp or do his job?
---
Big tiddy Poe GF
---
I love the username, too. 
---
I'd take bubba over the doctor any damn day, wtf.  Anyway, any team/survivor who dc's over nothing like that isn't worth your time.  That early in the game, the tides can change so dramatically.. super lame
---
My how......
---
Naaaauuuughty
---
Do his job, was good 
---
Then not a toxic Hillbilly. Can't call him toxic if he played fairly lol.
---
Screw it. I'm makin' one of these and posting it just to see Trapper at the top. 
---
Toxic isn't necessarily camping, it can be about the perks ;) 
---
The Naughty
---
You mean sensitivity, not sensibility.
---
Imo, it's just useful for getting people to the edge of the map for BBQ&amp;Chili to activate or for basement based builds.
---
Have you tried reinstalling? I have this issue crop up once in a while and when I restart my pc it goes away entirely. The little skill check cursor stutters while it moves, right? If you have a nvidia gpu you can go into the control panel and force vsync off for it through the game profiles (or mess with other settings there).
---
&gt;  but don't try and pretend that
---
I don't disagree that people are too quick to throw the toxic label at survivors because they're unhappy with certain game elements; however, your original claim is patently false. I can't recall a single time I've ever read someone ever claiming that killers can't be toxic or salty.
---
Both sides are quick to throw the toxic label at the other side because they're pissed off for losing. These babies need to grow up and get over it. 
---
&gt; My personal opinion is IDC what you use
---
As is mine, we don't disagree here. That said, I don't see it as unreasonable to be frustrated about certain things, be it survivor or killer side; I have my own issues with things on both sides of the aisle here.
---
&gt; the bias on this reddit is fucking real
---
I don't disagree with that either, though the balance of which side is more complained about seems to shift at a given time. From my own observations, the hate circlejerk tends to get more pointed towards the killers than the survivors, particularly because of frequent crying about "tunneling" and "camping", but my own observations don't really mean much because the sample size isn't consistent, nor is the viewing pattern.
---
Half of all the auric survivor skins (which is a small number) is still over a hundred dollars. That‚Äôs not okay.
---
BBQ, Hex Ruin, Whisperers and Lightborn, right?
---
Yeah I figured that out pretty quickly, but I just had that moment of "OH SHIT, THE BEE?!" when I saw it lmao
---
You are right, my bad.
---
Didn't have the last two, I think it was nurse 's calling and something else, 
---
That's an urn? Where did you get this information?
---
Is that what Trump would look like if he were the Grinch?
---
Im spanish and in spanish is Sensibilidad, so yeah.
---
In beta, Claudette was actually white. No joke. 
---
Ya see, the problem here is that I didn't actually make a complaint about DS, so your strawman here is pretty useless. 
---
Inb4 "yeah well other people complain about it so". 
---
Not toxic then. He played, he used perks, you guys used flashlights... seems fair.
---
BUT... BUT JUMPSCARE MYERS 
---
Love it! Very well made.
---
I'm not certain if its an urn. It looked like one to me. All the other info I pointed out shows this killer is most likely ancient
---
Ikr? That's my favorite way to play!
---
It ia confirmed that this killer is far older than any of the other killers in the game, and possibly extremely ancient.
---
Monitor and Abuse, Enduring, Whispers, Brutal strength(can be changed). This is PsychoScorpionZ build. When whispers turn on crouch to the gen go for the gen grab they won't hear the heartbeat initially because your terror radius would be 24m and whispers triggers at 32m. Enduring to never respect pallets. Also use your dashes at short loops. 
---
I love it. Could see Jeff as a fan of either Metallica, AC/DC, Nine Inch Nails, and System of a Down especially. Big on Metal and Hard Rock in general. 
---
I only know of 3 black people in this game. Claudette, Adam, and Tapp.
---
Focus on being scary and quit worrying about ranks/bloodpoints/badges. Try new killers and builds if you still want to be competitive. 
---
I used to always be in the 9-8, was fun, more challenging. But tbh 2-1 is awful. I always get camped or tunnel üòµüòµ  I don't know how we could make it more fun tbh 
---
Give us the ‚Äúreturn the slab‚Äù guy from Courage 
---
This just makes it so you can't(or shouldn't) tunnel the Dying Light obsession.
---
Shall I also give his highness my SSID? 
---
Agreed. 
---
Also, happy Escape Cake Day. (: 
---
Decisive Mallet 
---
I really wish Devs could somehow remove the.. I don't want to say *skill level* from the game. But I really wish they could somehow make the lower ranks like the topper ranks where people hide a lot more, looping is a lot worse, generators don't pop like bubblewrap, killers can't find you within 10 seconds of the game starting, they miss their swings a lot more, they *lose* you a lot more, Ruin's not as common, etc...
---
I just wish... everyone was bad again. The game was lot more fun back then.
---
No kidding. Just tonight I had some douche escape because of it. 
---
That‚Äôs not meg meg isn‚Äôt black 
---
I think Jeff is a real metal fan. Dying Fetus, Cannibal Corpse, Cattle Decapitation. 
---
On a macro level, sure, but you don't spend every other second going "Sweet Ruin stopped a gen from being completed" because it's not possible to know exactly when a gen would have been completed had you not had Ruin. It's harder to directly attribute Ruin to doing stuff, whereas if I use something like Nurse's Calling and find a survivor because of it, I can directly attribute that fun that I just had to Ruin.

Only problem was that after sending in the application, the hiring manager never replies back to you until you go to ask the status of your application and it turns out you've been fired 3 days ago for not showing up.
---
Camping a hook =/= hiding.
---
Camping a Hook technically advances the game (killing survivors) it‚Äôs shitty and bad, but it‚Äôs there. 
---
Hiding it not advancing the game. Actually, you‚Äôre going out of your way to *not* advance the game.  The equivalent would be standing at the top of the stairs as killer to lock people in the basement and then not hitting them at all - you‚Äôre preventing the game state from advancing on either side intentionally. And that‚Äôs holding the game hostage. 
---
I‚Äôd like to hear your counterargument 
---
I never rank passed 11. Omce i get there the fun stops. Turn off messages and just play if you derank then have fun again?

It would make Iron Maiden a Meta Perk.

---
This is Right.
---
I don't mind being advertised to when I already like the products. It's hardly sinister to remind me that frozen pizza is a thing, and im obviously invested in the game... I'm just happy that these companies employ people and pay them to make me smile.
---
I can power through Ruin, but not when there's a survivor with me, 'cause I choke on the pressure of not screwing up for both of us.
---
Id imagine the skill checks would need to be harder (dark cramped space). If it blocks nurses it would also need some kind of sound I feel like slight bumping or knocking
---
So this is a new account I made on Reddit and I'm only subscribed to DBD and Apex subreddit. This confused the hell out of me "wait Wraith goes through portal, not invisi-... ok"

Best Perk for Killer in the Game. Nurse's Calling being 2nd.
---
A man that finds it necessary to wear a helmet everywhere when not riding a bike. A very special man. 
---
Damn üëè right
---
His booty low
---
How is slugging not playing the game? 
---
So people who do swf are morons that cheat? Sounds like survivors got what they wanted lol 
---
Yeah, as soon as I hit red ranks with killer I stop playing them until rank reset. At least with survivor, I can play with friends and have fun that way lol. 
---
You could always derank some, though that kind of sucks for the survivors you're going against. 
---
Wish it was harder to rank up. I feel like a lot of people get boosted into red ranks that don't belong there. If it took longer to rank up, there'd be more diversity in the type of people you faced. 
---

Brainless convo between a DS using survivor and a NOED using killer. Both sides equal out to negative brain cells 
---
Doesn't he look like the Wraith basically?
---
"DS is fine just dribble/slug"
---
Use billy, spirit, or nurse and you‚Äôll be just fine lol 
---
IM SO FUCKING SICK OF TEAMMATES WITH NO BRAIN CELLS. RUIN SLOWS GENS DOWN, IT DOESNT PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING DONE. FUCKING DO GENS THROUGH RUIN. EVEN IF IT DOESNT GET FOUND. 
---
Pretty sure it was suppose to be original meg but they changed it like how they changed from teacher to nurse 
---
- Console players (including myself) ;(
---
Needs at least one chase perk. Spirit fury, enduring, bamboozle, or brutal strength
---
"Can they ban for dribbling/slugging?"
---
"Dribbling/slugging is toxic!"
---
u/not_Queen_bhvr

Wtf is this lmfao
---
That‚Äôs why I run Save The Best for Last in my eyes it‚Äôs a chase perk and a pretty strong one at that but I was thinking of dropping agitation for enduring

He wasn‚Äôt aesthetically pleasing either.

Uhhh I don‚Äôt know how much you have played but if you have enough peoples teachable unlocked then I‚Äôd say go for it, other wise I‚Äôd wait for some meta perks in the shrine if you don‚Äôt already have them
---
Fingers crossed PTB is released on all platforms at the same this time (coming from an Xbox mixer streamer and player)
---
Same, the only time I have a hard time is when the killers ping is high and it likes to bug out 
---
Encountering a friendly survivor is a .0001% probability. Regardless of how you play, regardless of if they lived or died, regardless of the build you are using, 90% of the time the post game chat will be like this. It stems from having a desire to always win, to always be right, and to push blame onto anyone but themselves. You played fine, you did what any other killer would have done, they just don't want to acknowledge the fact that it was their own stupidity that got them killed. Insulting you like that makes them feel better. 
---
Honestly, revel in their misery and anger, laugh at them, and move on. It's a game. 
---
We have a problem?
---
I honestly hope people start using his helmet on every outfit. 
---
I like to see both sides being toxic to each other.
---
This way, no one innocent is effected
---
Yeah, they said they'd be turning it on and off rip
---
Nice, I'll be doing this from now on. Hadn't thought of it that way. 
---
What even IS the Nerf to DS?
---
What are the rewards?
---
\-5 points? Ah, you never let me down reddit.
---
not sure, just did a quick check but didn't find much other than youtube and google play (to pay for). watchcartoononline.eu is somewhere i look for this stuff if i can't find it on netflix or prime. 
---
Really no one else does the totems?
---
I once got into a match with a Rank 2 who got less that 9K points, and he escaped
---
Yeah, honestly that's fair, I can understand not letting them go if they're BMing.
---
‚ÄúUh hello, yes, I‚Äôll take one large Meat Lover‚Äôs please.‚Äù ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Just letting you know it‚Äôs 049
---
I always just thought she was a poorly rendered Claudette. Now I gotta look into this
---
‚ÄúLol, later feng! Dwight has pizza waiting for us!‚Äù 
---
Thicc
---
Might sound weird but how many bloodwebs have you gone through since grabbing it in the shrine?
---
FUCK YOU GOT ME
---
If you're not interested then why are you here?
---
I mean damn, better than I could do! I love the colors and Nea is one of my fav survivors. :) love it
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and encounter the same issue from swf‚Äôs all the time. I don‚Äôt think they realize that the entire convo is looked at before action is done and they are potentially telling on themselves. Today I received my 4th message, since feb 14th, from Xbox love notifying me action was placed against a player lol. I just roll with the extra salty ones and let them make it worse for themselves
---
like 4
---
why noed isnt that powerful
---
thanks mate
---
That tier 1 ruin really messed someone up I guess 
---
Sometimes people just don't want to trust killers, so they GTFO as soon as possible and just get into the next match.
---
Sucks but hell I've done that before.
---
Friend: "I asked the killer if they wanna farm... Hey he's not hooking me!"
---
Me and the randoms start to heal in front of him. After 5 minutes, he downs all of us then hooks us all
---
Not gonna lie this reminds me of Black Clover how Jeff is holding up the Legion 
---
use stridor even i can consistantly get 4k games with it ^^
---
If they rework NOED please at least make it so adrenaline doesn‚Äôt give you a speed booste it hurts so much 
---
Playing the same three killers gets boring after a while. 
---
Shouldn't have to play for 20 minutes by entering and leaving a match.
---
Devs really need to fix Billy and Nurse.
---
I don't think they need to nerf NOED so much as make it less of an all/nothing ability.  I honestly don't believe people ignore totems because they want to rush gens or whatever, but because finding all of them is such a pain in the ass on the gamble that the killer has NOED.
---
So do something like:
---
"Once the last generator is repaired, all remaining totems activate.  For each totem that activates, all survivors suffer exposed status for 10/15/20 seconds.  Downing a survivor refreshes the effect.  Cleansing an active NOED totem stuns the killer for 1 second and reduces the max duration by the appropriate amount."
---
I think people would be much more likely to go after totems they see because it would at least have an effect.  It would have the intended effect of slowing the game, while still remaining an impactful ability.
---
Did you just sexually assault me?
---
Yeah. I guess a shotgun at the peak of fame is pretty edgy. 
---
Dave is a gift from god. I may not listen to the Foo often, but they are good people. The fame and fortune is just a bonus for doing what they love. 
---
&gt;Claudette, Adam and Tapp... and no one plays Tapp cause they kinda did his model dirty and his cosmetic choices aren't good. What's wrong with wanting more black characters? Killer ethnicity hardly counts, as you barely see yourself when you're the killer, and you play killers for their powers. Survivors are literally skins.
---
Not to mention Tapp is a licensed character. I'm definitely in the market for another black woman survivor. They could just add this character the way they did with Kate, Kate was originally going to be added in with Leatherface but they shelved her until the Clown DLC. 
---
Sorry, the *Teacher*?
---
People who know nothing of the genre tend to think post hardcore is edgy
---
Angelica as new killer
---
Perks:
---
Temper tantrum: throw a fit till survivors hook themselves 
---
Kick over blocks: all gens regress to zero even completed ones
---
Time out: bubba joins game and cellar camps survivors 
---
&gt;We really don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs more races than just black.
---
Says you. 
---
hes literally mumen rider from one punch man but with pizza, its perfect
---
This game is NOT in favor of Survivors
---
the problem with wraith is that he only has one consitent strat and that is a brute force strat. Bamboozle/spirit fury/enduring/ruin. Leave bamboozle away and a survivor can literally vault windows infinite times if you go invis (it takes longer to uncloak then to vault...). spirit fury and enduring are needed to shorten loops generally but the point is that good survivors will always go to long loops after the first hit.
---
10000000/10 for being a good enough not to run noed. Someone get this person a medal 
---
As someone with 2400+ hours played I have to disagree with alot of these if we're talking with add-ons. With add-ons Spirit is above everyone but Nurse. Legion, Hillbilly,Hag, Huntress, Clown, Doctor, Myers, Pig, Leather face, Trapper, Wraith, Freddy. I could go into lengthy details on why I'd put doctor as high as I do an Pig below Myers for example a 3 gen stall with Doctor is almost unbeatable and his kit has a ton of variety and versatility he can play differently and effectively around his perks and add-ons in a balanced and effective way that not alot of other killers have the ability to utilize. Between Restraint giving away survivors locations the entire match or Calm making his terror radius take up a large chunk of the map or even brute forcing and well timed shocks he's really hard to stop once he starts to snowball. Myers is another great example of add-ons and perks entirely changing a killer and how they approach survivors in a game and I feel even with the Pigs built in insidious and easier pallet mind games they can still waste alot of time on missed lunges or people steam rolling the gens and ignoring the reverse bear trap almost entirely. Legion with his absolute best add on is higher tier and outright not fun to play against and doesn't really have many options as far as outplaying a killer deciding to Frank's mix tape the shit out of you. Clown has poor map control but if used properly can end chases alot quicker than most of the killers underneath him if played smart. 
---
No Double BP...OP is just referencing doctor farming. Pretty misleading. 
---
May he RIP 
---
That‚Äôs neat, thank you!
---
I meant it more of a joke than a factual statement. They are still "playing" the game of course but not really playing the game in a way to have an actual back and forth.
---
Who said he would be a survivor? Maybe just a pikachu skin for dr because shock therapy
---
I'm trying to hide from the killer, but I'm dummy thicc and the sound of my asscheeks clapping together keeps altering the killer
---
BUT I LIKE THE SOUND THAT PLAYS WHEN YOU ESCAPE. AND I MAIN KILLER, SO DONT WORRY ABOUT MY BPS.
---
This joke is oversaturated 
---
it‚Äôs honestly looking a bit flat. i really wish they‚Äôd update the models a bit. some of the bums on characters really don‚Äôt blend with other joints that well. 
---
WHERE IS MY GODDAMNED FREDDY REWORK!? I WANT TO KILL YOU IN YOUR SLEEP BITCH!
---
Man that barely looks like him. I keep seeing a weird Sam Winchester/Jared Padalecki
---
THATS A THING ?
---
Yea just waste 60 seconds following the killer instead of powering through ruin. For 4 skill checks. Godsend he says.
---
Fuck that would be amazing. Agarrenlo! Esta herido! 
---
Kinda of, even running it on doctor who is a distressing king I only netted like 3k extra 
---
Totems do nothing but hurt you and your team. Survivors really don't have that much extra time to do things other than gens. 
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking!!!
---
I have to agree with you there wholeheartedly. 
---
Gimme some extra meat on that pizza. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Honestly, while I haven't played killer a whole lot, I've played a good 200 matches or so. Only once or twice did I come across a whole team using it, and still 3/4 of them died
---
Bottom left is my favorite
---
Just gentap?
---
I don't believe this character was Meg, the characters in the trailer struck me as original characters that were shelved. It'd be cool if they brought her into the game the way they did for Kate, to anyone who don't know, Kate was going to be in the game as a survivor opposite to Leatherface but she got shelved.   
---
She was the original locker person before Dwight so her perks should center around hiding.
---
It‚Äôs giving me some Egyptian vibes with the inscriptions on a sort of gold background. They said it‚Äôs the oldest killer, so my guess is it will be a mummy. 
---
I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THIS. IF THERES REALLY NO HOPE THEN JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU DIE, BY DCING YOU LOSE BP
---
He's not billy
---
... Fine.
---
*upset heavy breathing intensifies*
---
Lmao, what is this picture originally from ?
---
Don't use it but okay. 
---
NO BIGGIE IM SUPER USED TO IT WHEN IT COMES TO MULTIPLAYER GAMES SADLY
---
So wait does this mean 75% gen decrease is possible? That would mean Ruin is being replaced
---
I‚Äôm honestly fine with NOED as is except I‚Äôd just like to know it‚Äôs popped with the exit gates instead of when I try protecting a teammate, get downed, hooked, and left 4 dead.....
---
I was waiting for the Wraith burn, and it never came.  I'm so triggered.
---
BNPs are worthless now anyway.
---
Ruin gets me heated lmao 
---
&gt;Maybe if the surv bonus is only if you finish the round.
---
it only gives the quitter bonus to killer when the match is over so i'd imagine it would work the same
---
nah you wouldnt, as long as the timer is ticking down, its the same as facecamping
---
Freddy and I* Michael please.
---
Can someone explain how Adrenaline is supposedly so good? The speed boost you can just have all game through Sprint Burst and the instant heal is nice but can again have all game with Self Care. It just seems like an incredibly niche/situational perk?
---
reverse bear traps should activate with the trapdoor, its bullshit it doesnt
---
Apparently you didn't read the fourth section. I don't know what your intention is, but I don't think you reached it.
---
Yep. Was waiting for an insta-unblink Wraith with a NOED.
---
now thats an ass i would chainsaw
---
[https://imgur.com/a/lX2cldE](https://imgur.com/a/lX2cldE)
---
This but unironically.
---
We don't need a nerf to NOED, we'd most probably need a rework that deals with how Totems work. We won't have that any time soon tho. Or at all.
---
[I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs correct](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/bdfc0679-c320-47c4-90d6-b1650e058bcf)
---
his fetching fur his fetching eyes did hypnotize 
---
ITS NOT DELIVERY
---
Couldn't you call that..... a *Trapperzoid?*
---
BNPs are literal trash lol
---
On, high ranks on PC I have no doubt that's the case.
---
On console Ruin shuts down even Rank 1 games unless it gets cleansed, since the bad framerate combined with most Killers having bad ping makes hitting even good skill checks a challenge at points (Overcharge can be found in the Red Ranks for this exact reason). Generally, Survivors won't even try to do gens until Ruin gets broken.
---
Similarly, if I encounter someone running Ruin on PC, despite that fact that I'm in the Rank 10 range, I will usually be the only person who works on gens while Ruin is up.
---
OP's message is definitely still pertinent.
---
Quit guessing and get a clue!
---
No. You lose the 25%.
---
Love that Mumen Rider, the great C Class Hero, is here to help us out in Dbd
---
k
---
It‚Äôs a good perk for people that like to run the killer around because they won‚Äôt use self care cause it wouldn‚Äôt be much help 
---
A bueno, entonces solo escribes mal xD
---
You know where they are going and can use it to punish them for trying to get the trap off.
---
I'm guessing legion is still in the corner 
---
It's Claudette's mum
---
A very... [special guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/avntz5/ladies_and_gentlemen_special_ed_dwight/)
---
It's definitely part of the meta, but it's rare. You can actually go upwards of 7 games in a row WITHOUT seeing a Decisive.
---
Compared to my experience on PC it's practically a different world.
---
But what good does that do? It just pushes progress faster by causing the other survivors to not feel the need to worry about essentially killing their own team mates by doing gens. It takes away her unique type of pressure. 
---
The Entity ordered ham and pineapple.
---
We all know it, right?
---
My Freddy end game build: bitter murmur, dying light, blood warden, remember me with classroom photo, other add on doesn't matter
---
Np, thanks for the nice comment 
---
Like I get that, but again it‚Äôs only really useful if you‚Äôre the one being chased AND it‚Äôs when the last gen pops. Maybe I‚Äôll just have to try it out for myself to see, but I‚Äôm usually the one fixing the last gen üòÜ
---
It doesnt speed up the game any faster than any other killer. Besides, which is more important, stopping them for the moment (lets face it, they are going to get the trap off), or taking them out of the game?
---
Your not the sharpest knife in the block eh? ;3
---
Solo survivor is hell no matter the rank. Youll escape maybe a few games if ur lucky
---
True, it's just about who you feel the most comfortable with playing. I main wraith, doc, trapper, Billy and clown even though o think a few of them are quite weak
---
Even if they do eventually think it‚Äôs due for a rework, and looking at the DS changes we know they think it‚Äôs fine, what I‚Äôd like is more endgame shenanigan perks. Nothing feels sweeter than ignoring gen progress, chasing someone around most of the game and getting all the safe areas out of the way and suddenly when you let that last gen goes off, all your perks come into play and you‚Äôre just dunking all their hopes away. 
---
Pizza Time
---
I've also gotten pretty good at hitting Greats unless the game starts lagging, but most people I've played with don't even try to power through it. They either gen-tap or run off to find the totem.
---
Honestly I should probably always look for the totem first since I run Small Game, but I always try to get the Hatch ready to spawn before I hunt totems (and usually by then Ruin is either broken or being actively guarded).
---
At least you understand my LF placement. Everyone compares him to Billy and say he's worse, but that's not the way you should be looking at it. He had a fucking chainsaw! That's mid tier alone for me
---
only way to know if all totems are cleansed outside of calling out how many you cleansed in SWF is to personally go around and check all of the totem spawns yourself. If everyone had this mentality; Because apparently that's the mentality you're supposed to have if you want to counter noed; then you're probably spending 3-5 minutes per player checking every totem spawn across the entire map with no way to tell anyone else "ey you can stop wasting your time looking for totems, i got em"
---
Theres a difference between being useless and being selfish. You want to be an asshole cool, but sitting in a corner does nothing
---
That should be Michael!
---
"I could have kicked it apart by now."
---
Ultimate farm build (this is mostly a joke)‚Äô
---
Distressing, BBQ and Chili, Beast of Prey and Thrill of the Hunt all give extras points then put up a Survivor Pudding/Bloody Party Streamers 
---
You could also run this on hag and use her add on that gives her 300% more points in the deviousness category but or Billy/LF with the add on that makes their chainsaw not one hit but gives more BP or you could run the Trapper add on that makes it so the traps don‚Äôt do damage but give more points 
---
No unrelenting will though i assume
---
I thought PR was Public Relations. Can some one get us a link to what PR actually stands for?
---
I agree they should ignore the hook entirely however people with traps on rarely heal and as such are easy ambushes while on boxes. I agree people who camp/tunnel or chase trapped people for a long time are idiots
---
That would suck. My experience with using NOED is that all totems are cleansed almost every game.
---
I had someone with the same exact icon and username length send me something similar not that long ago. It wouldn‚Äôt shock me if it was the same person, yikes. 
---
It also saves you the time of healing, allowing you and a teammate to focus on the final generator instead of wasting the equivalent of half a generator healing. This game is all about time management. However, with NOED being so meta right now I would probably run Hope over it for the end game. 
---
Loud Clown coughing intensifies 
---
I would cleanse it
---
Gentapping is such a horrible strat. You get a gen done in like 160 seconds. You‚Äôd be better off powering through it or finding ruin 
---
Even as a survivor main I think that‚Äôs too much, it is a fairly risky perk. It‚Äôs only useful endgame, can be cleansed, and can be stopped entirely if all totems are cleansed before the end. So it definitely needs to be strong to make up for it, it just shouldn‚Äôt be so frustrating to get surprised by it when it‚Äôs too late (especially now that I wont even have a chance to save myself with DS)
---
I'd squat, rub it up, and awkwardly grunt and groan.
---
(Uncomfortably sexual grunts continue)
---
Mentally handicapped people like Dwight. 
---
It‚Äôs unfair to the artist to get your content stolen didn‚Äôt want it to happen it‚Äôs good that people point it out :)
---
If nobody is trying to even power through a gen, then yeah I'm gonna sit there for 2 minutes and gentap that shit 
---
Looks like a Roman Triumphal arch.  Rome also had the Cult of Mithra, patronized by soldiers... 
---
  
---
"Mithra, legend says, was incarnated into human form (as prophesized by Zarathustra) in 272 bc. He was born of a virgin, who was called the Mother of God. Mithra's birthday was celebrated December 25 and he was called ‚Äúthe light of the world.‚Äù
---
Lol they literally just made it to where you can no longer see the killers load out when you've died. It used to show them and now it doesn't. Because it would allow SWF to tell their team mates what the killer had. 
---
Is proportionally too big of a word for you ? 
---
That is the douchiest opening sentence to a message I've yet seen on this sub.
---
There are many clips of Tru3Ta1ent(and possibly others too) predicting whether killers have No One Escapes Death or not based on how well they play in the game before the generators are done. Of course this logic doesn't work all of the time but his success rate is pretty high which would suggest a connection between the perk and killers without a lot of skill.
---
How would you balance it?
---
I think you and me can tell the difference between people upset about the change and toxic survivors getting angry.
---
I mean, the joke was that one of the most evil humans ever called you mean for getting their hopes up and then crushing them.  So the joke only works if people agree with you that devotion changes are long overdue and the news for them long awaited, because otherwise the psychopathic torture fetishist complaining about you being mean even by his standards wouldn‚Äôt make sense.  So upvotes for this joke are still upvotes for the message of your post.
---
Lol only little bitches gen tap.  Just hit skill checks they aren't that hard.  I play on console with shit frames and they still aren't that bad if you play regularly.  Gentappers are for infants.  Eat your wheaties and work through it like the grownups do 
---
now might be the appropriate time to haul ass out of there 
---
(Resumes on blank totem to prevent noed) 
---
A bit off topic.  But my god do I miss the old Cartoon Network.
---
Not a nerf but okay.. 
---
Just Google it. You'll find tons of stuff on it.
---
Watch your 6 as you run. I hate seeing survivors not watching their backs when running from a killer.  
---
I have thought of this aswell, but i kinda like like the idea of having him here with the rest of the great slashers. 
---
I actually though of an idea for he is uniqie skill. Like what if like every 45 seconds Jason Mother calls out the location of one survivor for few seconds (i know this is like bbq and chilli but i would be a cool id√©a) and Maybe give him the abillity to break loops in a better way? 
---
Basically a lawsuit over the rights for the franchise but that can possibly be limited to the story itself and exclude character entire since he made a slight debut in the first film after which the guy who is suing for rights had no hand in the character Jason himself? Ah legal battles and the idiots who wage them instead of making a good movie/slasher tv show
---
Small game. Nuff said
---
Impossible = possible apparently.
---
Its not even a nerf, is a balance lol.
---
He's good for farming too. Or when you're pissed off at this game so you feel like annoying the crap out of everyone. 
---
The Hag: "Tired ass Ogre"
---
Shrek: "at least I am an Ogre, bitch! Go back to Grim pantry where you belong!"
---
Damn these totem spawns are really getting out of hand huh 
---
I feel like it's the "She has a gas mask!" kind of situation. The other thing is: decorative cherubim. It's not Mayan in any way. 
---
Never. There's a lawsuit going on which seems to have no end and even if it does, Jason will probably not be able to be used outside of Friday the 13th properties.
---
0.85a you mean.
---
That lawsuit is actually tied to the original movies. Platinum Dunes, who remade Nightmare on Elm Street and Texas Chainsaw also remade Friday. They can try and go for that license. 
---
A D M O R T E M
---
Loll really?
---
God damn it you beat me to it
---
Too long
---
Simply reading this post broke my fucking ankles, and I will be seeing you in hell.
---
In solo surv, not really. One match one of my teammates cleansed Ruin, and i cleansed 3 dull totems, but because i couldn't find the last one, NOED activated. Sometimes it's not about "wanting to genrush the killer" but how it's so fucking dull and annoying to run around the map trying to find some bullshit totem spawns
---
Yup. I responded
---
"What logic is that?"
---
And he started the bollocks about all survivors are toxic scum or whatever ugh
---
I WAS PLAYING SURVIVOR ON BLOOD LODGE AND  WAS BEING CHASED ME INSIDE A BUILDING, I RAN OUTSIDE, GOT HIT OUT OF NOWHERE AND RUBBER-BANDED BACK INSIDE WHERE THE KILLER WAS. WHY
---
And you also have to use DS withing a timer of 60 seconds. And they reduced the stun.
---
Honestly I use DS and happy with the changes, your salt is pouring out fam
---
But all nerfs have the purpose of balancing the thing they're nerfing. They reduced the stun, added some requirements for you to use it and added a timer in which you have to use it. Does that not sound like a nerf?
---
I think if you play a lot you can guess that someone has adrenaline when they don‚Äôt want to get healed when there is only one gen left
---
The man at the bottom of the screen had a fair point 
---
Ug, can‚Äôt you just use Satan like the rest of us? I mean I figure that wasn‚Äôt a quote of his but I don‚Äôt know what that mo fo was thinking, and I don‚Äôt really want to google ‚Äúwhat was that assface thinking‚Äù cuz that‚Äôll just lead to some bad shit. We just had a congressman quote Mussolini unironically on Twitter so I was a little concerned that this was like normal now. Sorry to snap at you. Hex: r/deadbydaylight just vexes me sometimes.
---
IIRC, actually Sean Cunningham sued Victor Miller because he made a legitimate claim to the rights of a script he worked on; thanks to the recent Copyright Act, which allows for copyright claims to be made 30 years after a transfer of said rights.
---
Regardless the whole thing *was* stupid and easily could have been avoided.
---
I love the double standards some killers have on this game, always saying that survivor mains are the ones crying about everything, while at the same time bitching about literally EVERYTHING.
---
I play both killer and survivor and jeez, if I lose I lose, why ruin the fun of others just because you‚Äôre a sore loser?
---
Heres the thing, you all assume im not rank 1 lul.
---
my thoughts after cleansing the killer‚Äôs supposedly Ruin totem
---
Its also good if you are hooked when gens pop. Once you are freed it's  instant full health and speed. Good vs endgame camping. 
---
The community
---
Getting health state back is massive in endgame, especially is killer doesn't have noed. Combined with resiliance and gens will fly pretty fast, if killer doesn't find you.
---
STBFL is legit good now what you talking bout.
---
__If you add up all the survivor ranks it comes out to 23 though so really it‚Äôs unfair for the survivors.__
---
Ah might have confused the two, but yeah really should've been avoided and believe that law needs a touch up to avoid stuff like this. It's pretty much putting a strangle hold on a good slasher character so nobody can use them
---
Honestly losing as a survivor in the asylum is a shame on its own. Unless it‚Äôs the spirit or the nurse..
---
Now I know why my pizza arrived 1h late.
---
And, how is totem cleansing going? Every game all 5 totems cleansed?
---
I would hardly call myself a fan boy. If they fixed the game maybe I would have a easier time enjoying the game. 
---
That was really helpful advice.
---
Having an actual punishment for camping or hard tunneling.
---
Theory: Anyone who unironically starts post game chat with "ggez" is also going to tell *some*one to 'commit die' in that same post game chat.
---
There's a few problems with that. 
---
It's a massive waste of time. 
---
They'd get far more bloodpoints by playing normally. 
---
If they all quit, they forfeit all bloodpoints anyway.
---
I don't see why you'd be worried about a SFW group doing that, because it'd be *stupid.*
---
So they killed the perk to make another one better. Seems logical.
---
Run Enduring if you have to.
---
Hallowed Ground is the best designed perk in the game IMO. All totems should have some risk reward design, not just 
---
&gt;See totem
---
&gt;MUST DESTROY
---
I was the first found, chased, downed, trapped, hooked. No probs, it's the aim of the game. Killer goes into the creep mode, waits for me to be unhooked, follows me to a box, chases, downs me. Hooks me again. Repeat, and I'm dead. In that time 4 gens got done. Other survivors were very visible. One tried getting behind me to take a hit and was ignored. It was excessive. When I play killer I have different styles for different killers, my own methods od tunneling and camping as well, but that to me was just excessive. I was the only kill they got because of that. 
---
In your situation, sure. Reasonable. I'm talking more specifically only going after the people with traps. It confuses the daylights out of me tbh.
---
The ultimate troll move, especially if you get lucky and SIE hands out a ban
---
It's an emote already :) 
---
I honestly think leader should have been left alone and prove thyself would increase great skillcheck zones for each person near you, so you know, you could actually "prove yourself" or something
---
Nah gotta follow the high ranks, just facecamp with noed, your power even helps you do it.
---
If the legion doesn't tunnel and moonwalk they're pathetically weak. If you do play like that then it's horribly unfun as a survivor since you can't do anything.
---
Trump? ‚ÄúNew killer called, the president‚Äù
---
I didnt realize it was the actual company. That's great 
---
Pressing the escape key has become my habit when getting downed by a legion
---
Jokes side, that is pretty damn cool and accurate 
---
It's okay he runs urban

This is how your opinion becomes irrelevant. Ignore the literal undeniable truth.
---
Good point. 
---
Now, how to make the devs take note?...
---
Tbh, I'd just be happy for them to fix the loading screen DC. 
---
I mean the way you described it it doesn‚Äôt sound like that player plays that way specifically with the pig, probably their general way to play unfortunately.
---
‚ÄúXD‚Äù is a naughty word
---
It was a joke, jesus
---
Well I just played a game against a rank 1 P3 nurse and I cleaned for totems and I did get noed :( but after we got one down it got cleansed pretty quickly and three escaped
---
If we had that logic we‚Äôd never have Leatherface in the game. I know people give him a lot of crap but he‚Äôs my favorite killer. 
---
And the licensed characters were put in before the store and thus before cosmetics which means it wasn‚Äôt part of their negotiations. Now that it‚Äôs there it‚Äôll be part of negotiations for future licenses so we might get cosmetics for future licensed characters. 
---
That was bugging me too. I know some arent the greatest at grammar but I just cant stop myself from correcting it, at least in my head.
---
Ruin is a stress of its own. Is it gonna spawn in front of a survivor? How long is it going to last? Is it even going to buy me time?
---
I just run tracking perks and hope for the best. Both sides are fun for different reasons, really.
---
i had something like this happen, i was running devour hope on hag (i was trying to unlock her teachables and level her up) and got a 4 k, but had to dc and lose all my points because once i moried the last survivor i got stuck in the match.
---
SWF destroys game balance more then enough in favour of survivors adding so many info via UI honestly what horror is there in a horror game any more?!? 
---
Also if they add all of those things to buff randoms experience they would need to buff killers further to compensate..., and then you would have survivors pushback on that too!
---
Time to crouch down and make suspicious noises in the middle of the street.....again 
---
Rank
---
I get the bee meme it's just not that funny.
---
Give Michael a break, the last time anyone tried to teach him grammar he was like 6 years old.
---
DARN
---
Gen tapping isnt effective though. Its more effective to just normally work through it.
---
Do you think they do anything though??
---
Here we go, you get it, i WAS running small game but good enough at sniffing out towns that i threw it in for another perk. I cleanse 2 at least each game and more if no one else is doing them.
---
Not to mention all bringing Saboteur and toolboxes. This would make the game hell for the killer.
---
Does it have any liver for toppings? Asking for my gran
---
It's really not especially in solo queue.
---
ahaaaaaa ty i guess
---
Step 1: hit survivor
---
Step 2: stand still for 5 seconds
---
Step 3: after standing still for 5 seconds, use Bloodhound to follow the blood while not in a chase
---
Step 4: survivor either mispositioned themselves while mending and you can hit them normally or their bleedout timer is so low they will go down with a frenzy hit. And almost all legion add ons only make this easier
---
No counterplay from the survivor at all. The chase is in your hands as Legion, similar to Nurse but in a way more scummy and unskilled way. The build I mentioned is pretty basic, BBQ/Monitor/Sloppy/Bloodhound.
---
ok i‚Äôll get right on that
---
Getting a dislike means absolutely nothing lol I think the only thing that matters is unsportsmanlike too many times for leaving the match
---
NOED rework
---
* 50% cdr on hit attacks 
---
* 20% stun resistance
---
* stacks
---
Remove speed and Instadown
---
Fixes one of the main issue with NOED, not its power but the inherent feeling of ‚Äúthat was BS!‚Äù from a random instadown from nowhere, the stun resist makes late game DS and safe loops significantly less powerful (more so with enduring), but the killer can still be looped due to no ms and windows existing.
---
For worry‚Äôs about 90%cdr with STBFL, and 95% stun resist with enduring, I remind you that STBFL needs to be stacked, and it‚Äôs still NOED, cleanse the totems.
---
then get totems? lmfao
---
it's your own fault if noed is activated
---
New to the game, what is DS and why is the community split on it?
---
Yea save the best for last is pretty good. I hate not being able to hit my obsession tho. I want to be able to chase everyone I see
---
&gt;Spirit relies on addons to be good, too much of a notification and not many mind games anymore. That said, shes still top tier.
---
Not really. If the survivor doesnt have Iron Will the chase is pretty much over in 5 seconds against an injured survivor
---
I named Legion the Tumblr Killer
---
I just slug the unhooked guy if the unhooker wanished
---
Killer literally not being able to hit survivors more than lets say 3 times during a trial is better than a survivor who cleansed 3, did gens, unhooked and stalled the killer for a long time? Dat logic.
---
I‚Äôm just saying if you want to be successful and aren‚Äôt good enough to have success at that level with other kills then use ones that are easy to have success with because their powers are so strong
---
It's a rework that was needed and is fair, not a nerf imo as it's still a usable perk considering not a ton of people use moris unless for a daily. 
---
Cleansing totems counts towards Lightbringer though
---
Remove the movement speed buff and let survivors know they are exposed. It doesnt need to be neutered like DS. 
---
Interesting how the devs dont think NOED and DS are similar. I see tons of similarities between the two. 
---
All I really want is a perk overhaul. Buff a bunch of perks on both sides like how they did to Surveillance and Alert. 
---
Not every survivor main gives a shit about DS. That‚Äôs like me saying ‚Äúthe killer mains were so salty when Nurse received her first and only nerf, which then got reversed instantly because they kept crying about it‚Äù.
---
You can be reported 100+ times on PS4 And nothing will happen 
---
I LOVE WHEN I GET DOWNED AFTER A LONG CHASE AND SEE EVERYONE MOPING AROUND CROUCHING, THEN WHEN I GET HOOKED THEY MOVE TO A GEN AND WORK IT. LIKE BETTET LATE THAN NEVER I GUESS, BUT NOW I'M FUCKED BY YOU AND OH YEAH THE KILLER WILL PROBABLY BE A TUNNELING ASS.
---
I got reported for wallhacking.... In a xbox...
---
IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS ANTI CHEAT SOFTWARE THAT GOES INTO EFFECT IF YOU WAIT TO READY UP. WAS THAT A LIE? IT'S WHY I SOMETIMES WAIT AS SURVIVOR.
---
USUALLY THOUGH I READY UP AS SOON AS I'M IN AND PULL UP CHROME UNTIL THE GAME STARTS.
---
torso is still upright
---
He'll have to keep that pose the entire time
---
I MEAN IT LITERALLY IS CAMPING, IT'S JUST CLEARLY NOT TOXIC IN ANY WAY TO DO IT WHEN THE GATES ARE POWERED. THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE FOR YOU TO DO BUT GUARANTEE THE KILL.
---
\[pinches at skull cheeks?\]  
---
\["rattle me bones" sound effect?\]
---
Oh god, that‚Äôs really it isn‚Äôt it?
---
DUDE SERIOUSLY, SOLO IS THE FUCKING WORST. I DON'T PLAY SUPER OFTEN AND SO EVERY RANK RESET I'M BACK IN THE TEENS AND IT'S A BULLSHIT SLUG TO TRY AND MAKE IT TO A RANK WHERE MY TEAMMATES MIGHT BE HALFWAY COMPETENT, ONLY FOR RANK RESET TO HAPPEN AGAIN.
---
KILLER ALL THE WAY.
---
UGH I MAIN HAG AND CAN'T STAND HOW STUPID SURVIVORS ARE WITH HER AND HOW MUCH OTHER HAGS ARE PIECES OF SHIT. LIKE SHOOT, JUST HAVING THEM HAVE TO CROUCH WALK IS PUNISHING ENOUGH, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A PIECE OF SHIT IF SOMEONE TRIGGERS THE TRAP. SOMEONE IS ANNOUNCING THAT THEY AREN'T GOOD AT THE GAME, NO NEED TO BE TOXIC.
---
I'm shivering in my custom baby seal leather boots.
---
The reboot was labeled a sequel to the originals so they should be able to use it but jason with the hockey mask was supposed to have been horror incs because it was part 3 but they still have everything jason related halted for some reason. 
---
Stop complaining about Freddy and spread the message #SupportFreddyDBD 
---
Well duh. I'm just saying it becomes an incentive for a killer to NOT want to because those gens will be popping even faster now. Same premise, faster outcome. Leaves more time for someone to swoop in with borrowed time and save the day.
---
Could be that it only works when the killer is not in a chase.
---
That was a meme premade or these people don't understand the game
---
Yesterday i played a total of 12 games at night
---
All of them at least one of these things hapenned
---
P3 claudette dc'ing after getting downed
---
Someone else also dc'ing because it's a swf with claud
---
Someone doesn't load in and it's a 3 v 1 against a wraith with silent add-ons
---
Killer has the random will to check a locker that im in
---
In one specific game all of the above hapenned at once
---
Thank you. 
---
Op isnt asking why cant he see the killers perks when he dies. He just asked why cant we have a match history log where we can see the game stats after it ended. 
---
Acceptable for normal gameplay
---
almost impossible for nurse and huntress
---
How do you turn the character models? On pc with xbox controller. 
---
The Cheeto
---
I'm really looking for a chapter that's got a bit more of a beauty or "glam" to it. Like Gothic romance-horror haunted lady style you know. 
---
Every chapter with the exception of legion's ability has been able to fill up so many niches and styles of horror. Hope this one ticks a new box in the game that will blow my socks off. 
---
I'm not normally one to agree with the comunity when it comes to speculation (because the majority have been wrong about every chapter speculation) but I hope that they're right time, and the chapter's killer is some sort of priestess or some lady pharoh mummy or something.  
---
(Ds gets nerfed)
---
This guy:

{Mathieu's steam profile}
---
-Rep, nerfing underpowered perks
---
This, and also I‚Äôve seen jokes on this sub and even from my own friends along the lines of ‚ÄúI was doing ___ and this idiot was doing a totem‚Äù like I get there‚Äôs a time and place to do them, but it‚Äôs been memed to a point where cleansing a totem is the bottom of priorities. 
---
Well theh canno only make 25% of a gen so it makes sense they only made 2
---
If u think about it if NOED wasn't so powerful, no one would bother cleansing dull totems
---
That's what people said about the huntress. But idk I think I'd be down for that still. 
---
I'm sure I could get a spagetti pizza.  
---
perhaps asking for it, means they take the spagetti code of DBD and fix it that way?  
---
no? bit to much of a stretch? - Better than just saying "FIX THE GAME!" to twitter accounts.
---
Then hide in a locker and make another awkward grunt/groan/squeek
---
wait wait wait.  
---
BHVR Made that pos?
---
I can see it (now) [https://imgur.com/gallery/V9Dy7Y2]
---
If anything else hopefully someone makes a site like [op.gg](https://op.gg) for DbD so we can look at more statistics like win rates with perks, killers, etc...
---
Hope it's nkt haunted grounds
---
A SWF will just run the killer around the hook while one person does gens.

FREDDY IS GOOD IF YOU KNOW HOW TP PLAY HIM GOOD, CHANGE MY MIND
---
He needs a nice boy bussy, 
---
Checked my Xbox reports yesterday, I have 54 for unsporting, no idea why, I‚Äôm not toxic play solo and of killer I only camp of the doors open. 
---
or if the back just started with a few token at the beginning of the trial...
---
An incentive to reach rank one, maybe like a bonus half mill blood points or something. 
---
What? you don‚Äôt let everyone escape and you occasionally hook someone?! UNSPORTMANLIKE!
---
I love how people will screech this shit but when you ask how the game is broken people either have batshit ideas or complain about the same 10 things that aren't actually broken.
---
I would bend down next to it, stroke it and grunt.

He has a corpsepaint skin so definitely black metal
---
stop being a lazy fuck lmfao
---
Nah, he has a corpsepaint skin, his stuff is Emperor, Darkthrone, Immortal, Mayhem, etc.
---
It would have to be if a survivor is within a certain distance and so it the killer it doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
WHY DOES FRANKS MIXTAPE EVEN EXIST? SO BROKEN.
---
They probably do I‚Äôm just not familiar with psn 
---
That‚Äôs not really the point, now is it?
---
This does little to prevent it from being nearly shut down by the low terror radius/stealth killers, a faster charge and an added ability to gain charge by looking at the killer (who is not heavily obstructed by objects) would help make it into a more consistent perk.
---
How?? I'm still relatively new to the game, but Legion has incredible speed, great tracking, and is super agile. He's easily the scariest killer for me to face, and the most fun to play.
---
Their frenzy can get nuts with some of the addons and what not.
---
I'd be happy with this if they added skill checks to totems. Way too much of a nerf to hex perks otherwise, people would just rush the totems at the start every game.
---
Says the one who probably uses NOED to down survivors without really chasing them. Lazy, huh? 
---
i don't use noed because i don't need crutch perks
---
Dying Light should long have been reworked to only apply as long as the Obsession is in injured, dying, or hooked state, anyway. A perk that directly encourages hard-tunnelling or the use of Moris is a bad design.
---
‚Äú Can I disconnect in real life ? ‚Äú

Calling someone out on flaws of his argument=whining. Huh what do you know, TIL. I guess you can't really support you argument anymore can you? It's okay dw about it.

---
&gt; Murmur.
---
I'm sorry, but do you mean Bitter Murmurs? As an end game perk? It gets value for the entire game. This is irrelevant to the rest of your post, I'm just really confused how you think it's supposed to be an end game perk.
---
I didn't mention unhooking while Noed is active and the killer is there? 
---
Honestly. Just do gens and find the totem endgame if needs be- the killer can't protect a hook and a totem at the same time unless they're very lucky. If you're playing solo you're probably not going to find all 5 totems anyway, meaning it was a complete waste of time and now you have NOED spawned on one of the more hidden totems.
---
They have not nerfed Ruin yet because good survivors will destroy you in 4 minutes without it.
---
The fact that the devs know this and instead of fixing the game they would rather leave the perk in this broken state is a testament to their incompetence. Kinda like leaving the Billy/Nurse alone so they can justify making every other killer low tier.
---
After being downed and picked up if you are the obsession you can hit a somewhat difficult skillcheck and escape the killers grasp. If you arent the obsession you have to get your wiggle bar somewhere between 30-40% before the skillcheck appears. Killers hate it because they look at it as a free escape. It's basically a second chance.
---
Either remove exposed status effect or the speed boost. Cant have both. Then its ok
---
The person you replied to did in his scenario of the survivors being worse than the bad NOED killer
---
He didn't even try to crawl away after getting downed...
---
You‚Äôre retarded
---
I get why they changed it but it bugs me because I like to see the build people use. With more experience you'll be able to know what they are running by how they play. Some arent obvious though which is why I like to look at the perks end game.
---
Those are all reasons why I don't like Rancor. I'd rather just take STBFL and get a guaranteed benefit out of it.
---
[got you](https://imgur.com/a/sD1880m) 
---
Wow what a massive "captain Obvious" 
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like anything to me
---
I don't think it needs to be *nerfed*, it's not overpowered by any means. I just don't think it is fun and would like to see it reworked, but I understand that that is no easy task. Took 'em how long to rework DS? If we're lucky they're working on Ruin too.
---
Maybe we can go back to using it as a complement. 
---
When I attack people with trap on its mostly because I randomly find them. A free hit is a free hit. I rarely chase and hook them though.
---
Are you still in 2016?
---
Got the Adept Shape achievement yesterday, and I also wondered wtf was up with his perks contradicting each other, but atleast I got it on the first attempt
---
&gt;with every successful attack
---
AFAIK, PWYF loses stacks whether you actually hit someone or not. That's part of why it sucks so bad. 
---
But overall, you're very right. STBFL encourages you to do nothing with your obsession, PWYF requires you to find your obsession and consciously choose to lose a chase, and Dying Light encourages you to find and kill your obsession ASAP. They don't work well together. PWYF and STBFL seem to want to work together, but with how the game goes, there's currently not enough time in the game to make it work. 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs part of the problem I can imagine from somebody trying to run all three of his perks.
---
Also, congrats to getting the achievement!
---
No, that doesn't even compare. Ds happens from killer downing survivors, their objective. Survivors activate noed by not doing totems..
---
Exactly. That said, with the new Obsession mechanic a dev said you could get 4 moris out of Rancor. Still has the problem of the gens never getting all 5 completed, still not justifiable a perk slot.
---
BHVR taking a risk? Good luck. Theyd rather nerf something and create a new bug :x
---
Oh shit really? PWYF makes you lose a stack for EVERY attack? That sucks HARD.
---
tell me more
---
Yep. PWYF's description says "Each offensive action spends one Token". This means that each time you swipe your weapon, whether it actually hits or not, you lose a token. It's a hell of a lot of work for an extremely easily lost and miniscule payoff. PWYF just sucks.
---
&gt;What do y‚Äôall think?
---
I think those cuntvivors need to be turbobanned.
---
Two words: Haunted Grounds
---
Adept Shape is basically you choosing what perk to rend useless
---
It's free blood points. 
---
I GOT SMACKED THROUGH A WINDOW AND PALLET BY A FREDDY 4 TIMES. 
---
I THOUGHT THEY FIXED WINDOWS. HE WASN'T EVEN NEAR ME WHEN HE HIT ME TOO
---
Salt can change a man lmao
---
My thoughts? I smile, I brush the salt off my shoulders and drink my wine
---
Think about it from the survivors perspective, you have a time limit where if you don't rush to each box immediately and get super unlucky you'll die before getting the trap off
---
Literally fucked lmao killer dont realize most arguments go both ways. 
---
Ranking system for sure. 
---
Spamming a move is just an instinctive thing, doesn't have to mean anything good or bad. Is like spamming L1 in Dark Souls. Just means excitement.
---
you must be new here
---
Thank yous are pretty rare unless you drop people on the hatch. You can try to play by survivor rules, don't camp don't tunnel and the best thing you'll get is a gg. I actually had a very rare case yesterday where someone typed "nice killer" to me at the end. I asked him what he meant he said because I didn't camp and tunnel. I honestly don't remember the last time someone complimented me or whoever was playing killer before that. To be fair, I rarely compliment other people either, except for when I've been having bad games and start to apreciate fair people more.
---
You shouldn't be nice to get a thank you but because you feel good about it. 
---
When NOED wastes this much time for survivors, compare that to Ruin. Spending 4+ mins not making gen progress. And that's when you've countered NOED. It's still a net gain compared to "countering" perks like BBQ.
---
It was specifically asked for T-bagging though, which assumes they're doing it at the exit gate our when they know the killer is beaten.
---
Stupid sexy Flanders!
---
This is amazing and I will be doing it next time I‚Äôm against a killer that has it.
---
Wow! Where did you get the inspiration for that pose :0... Unbelievable! 
---
Hmm, I have to say I barely ever played Hag or played against her(after the "rework").
---
She might be stronger, but the highest I would place her would be last in B Tier.
---
Between survivors it‚Äôs like a handshake. When you do it to a killer it‚Äôs usually teasing but one or two slow squats is usually thank you. 
---
Maybe they are going for the 125 trap achievement. I wasted all my traps as soon as possible for the achievement 
---
Don't just hex totems count towards lightbringer? I've never heard of dull totems doing anything but giving you 600bp for cleansing. 
---
Humblebragging is for people with a small penis, change my mind.
---
I mean idk about you but I‚Äôm never that happy when a killer disconnects, unless it‚Äôs like at the very end of the game.
---
If they cant hit great skill checks i doubt theyre gonna be able to loop or even lose a killer long enough to get them stake out stacks lol.
---
Y'all gay.
---
kindred buff idea. add this to base kit and make kindred hook to death time take twice as long without having to mash buttons. show the killers aura after a hook for 4 seconds, the same way bbq does?
---
I'm one of the killers who's after the other's throats. if I see that it's a tbagger or that pallet drop flashlight guy, or that attention seeker he's getting the tunnel 
---
After the changes to lockers the only way you can justify that nowadays were if you actually saw someone or their scratch marks. Now theres no justification for "not seeing anyone in bbq camping".
---
I still have to unlock many perks on my Huntress. Mine is in a bad place right now :( I'm working on Freddy at the moment
---
Im starting to work on nurse until i get at least one dlc in the future. Which is probably gonna be Myers.
---
every other swf match with my group, at least 1 person gets killed by mori. I'm the only red rank, the rest of my group is green or yellow.
---
Yes! It also has a slightly different sound in the main menu as well. When I first got the game I did my usual gut check reaction thing for most games and lowered the game menu music volume way down. Recently turned it back on within the last week and think the transitions are super cool! 
---
And doing gens, which are their objective.
---
Well this would be different to kindred as kindered, at its lowest tier only allows 2 suriviors to see each other when some one is hooked where as top tier kindred will allow all the survivirs to see each other plus the killer. This change would only allow the survivors to see the killer if the killer stays around the hooked survivor for a short period. You could say its like an incredibly weak version of kindred. 
---
This one actually had nothing to do with the power, twas merely me having a fully stacked Save the Best For Last.
---
Hello :) How do you do those edits ? Is it a software or something else ?
---
The Devs have suggested having kindred as default but nothing so far
---
I use Adobe Photoshop! I just play around with the warp and transform tool :)
---
Thank you. I needed a thicker Dwight in my life 
---
I keep saying this, if the devs don't plan on doing a rework of Noed, they need to add a totem counter, or some way to identify if all totems are gone, at least. Right now, swf have a immense advantage since they can just count together how many totems they did, and organize where they did them, making it very easy for them while solo has no such information. Even with a totem counter, solo would not know where all the totems get cleansed, but it would be a way fairer thing then it is now.
---
Noed is a pure net positive. Either you get a super powerful effect at the end, or you waste the survivors time. Sometimes both, since only 4 totems did get done (probably one survivor doing all 4 of those, then getting hooked and the other survivors don't know if they need to look for another totem or not). Add to that that each map now also often has 1 or 2 spots that are actually decently hidden, and cleansing a totem is not just a 10 second thing, but something you have to go out of your way to do, easily wasting a lot of gen progress that could be made
---
And?
---
This is scarier then his mask.
---
Just imagine that chasing you, grinning ear to ear.
---
negative im a dwight main for almost a year now and i barely go in lockers &gt;:(
---
May I ask why you are continuing the thread? I know my motivations but not yours
---
What do you mean fix it? Thick Dwight is the ultimate life form 
---
Because the traps are genuinely garbage. They don‚Äôt kill players, that‚Äôs a myth. They serve to slow the progression of the game down and survivors seem to remove them extremely quick most of the time.
---
Playing as pig, it doesn‚Äôt make a difference if you are working on a gen or are trying to remove the trap. The first survivor I see im going to try and hook. Also, you‚Äôre very loud at the jigsaw boxes, so this probably alerts the killer you‚Äôre there as they‚Äôre patrolling gens. Maybe that gives the illusion they are tunneling you.
---
If you need help, hmu with a reddit message and I see what I can do.
---
that would be the difference in a Google search
---
Is that just a coincidence of some random kids' test who tried to troll the teacher? Incase it is, great find, OP.
---
It just annoying considering that the PS4 queue times are terrible. It sucks to wait ten minutes to find a game just for the killer to disconnect in the middle of it.
---
Time to give Dean Winchester a call
---
Good job man you dumpstered some scrubs lol there is always gonna be someone salty. Dont let it affect you. You played well.
---
Cheers man ‚úÖ 
---
Idk he‚Äôs just not for me I guess
---
I don‚Äôt see why people get so pissy about it. In my eyes it‚Äôs a bit of fun in a game that has little to no communication. 
---
Time to cleanse

YESTERDAY I TRIED TO GET MY LAST ADEPT ACHIEVEMENT  THE HILLBILLY FOR 3 HOURS.  ONE SURVI DC'D I KILLED THE OTHERS BUT I DIDN'T GET THE ACHI SO I TRIED AGAIN FOR 2 HOUR AND ONCE FINALLY I KILLED ALL THE ACHI STILL NOT POP UP. I WAS RAGED SO HARD AND I FIND OUT I'M ALREADY DID IT ON JANUARY 15TH.  AND I RAGED EVEN MORE BEACUSE I JUST LET MYSELF SUCK FOR NOTHING 
---
Yesssss
---
The perfect organism 
---
Kindred only really works for killers that are pretty damn close. Kindred doesn‚Äôt matter for a SWF or just smart players honestly. It‚Äôs to help swap the annoyance to the killer as a kick back perk. 
---
So you're saying that the killer is simultaneously able to chase you through 8 pallets while getting stunned and blinded at each one but somehow unable to catch you? Bullshit.
---
bad to none counterplay with low risk high reward.
---
when wiggling, roll the analog stick in a circle instead of mashing back and forth.
---
Which fanfic is this from? 
---
Let‚Äôs toss in that it adds adrenaline to the hooked survivor, borrowed time, and 100% chance of unhook on last gen completion. 
---
Well no one really knows how long people have been stuck here, but they spend a long time running around. 
---
yeah, just like, go with evan instead of myers, at least evan isn't super evil like myers
---
Very solid build but I suggest swapping pop goes the weasel with bbq for tracking and bloodpoints and if you want you can swap bamboozle with enduring because of the current ds+pallets. Throw a bottle at the bottom of the survivor with enduring and it's as if they didn't even use it. After the ds change perhaps you can bring back bamboozle but at the moment enduring is probably better 
---
Its the emphasis on toxic. Surv mains like me and you dont use it. Buuuut, quote on quote ‚Äútoxic‚Äù surv mains do
---
Running don't make your ass big. 
---
I still can't figure it out...is the legion from a movie or not? If yes... witch movie? 
---
Myers is evil incarnate, rationalizing his murders voids the character. Jason is the one that kills teenagers because of peepee adventures.
---
I check that and when it's private or disabled I may delete their post on my profile.
---
DS is made to use it, like NOED is made to being used, too.
---
Still not knowing in which possible way is ds toxic. 
---
Maybe you don't know what being toxic means.
---
What's even the point of NOED then, if survivors immediately know you have it? All that'll do is make survivors hide until it's gone, which completely nullifies its purpose.
---
Here is how you counter ruin
---
You walk around for 10 seconds and you will probably find the totem you are welcome
---
Tremendously ez skillcheck*
---
When you don't have a game that is trying to be a competitor of DBD
---
Perfect totem spot
---
I don't think my Nurse has all perks either :/ But she's got a lot. She's my second favorite killer :)
---
Except a lot of perks are shut down depending on the killer.
---
Spine Chill is shutdown from Myers. Object of Obsession by Freddy. Taht's just two examples on the top of my head, but i'm sure you can find other (such as perk shut down because of the map *cough cough* balanced landing).
---
Charging just b y looking at the killer seems too powerful to me. Survivor have a huge field of vision, and this would make it a bit too easy to gain token. 
---
So you‚Äôre saying he likes to play ~~with his food~~ hard to get. 
---
Not gonna judge you for using perk that the game devs added, perk is not toxic per se its just really crutchy like noed, and can be used in a way to bully killers just like facecamping is in the game can be done but still kinda toxic behavior to do it.
---
But if its in the game why are you commenting on changing it is bad? 
---
If its a bad perk according to you why would you care if they changed it?
---
I actually laughed out loud at this.
---
YOU NEED THE SWEATPANTS WITH THE SOCKS AND THE SHIRT WITHTHE TARGET ONTHEBACK!!!!
---
yeah iknow lol, i just avoid lockers cause every single fucking time i go in one even let it be at the other side of the map cause the killer has BBQ i somehow get caught 
---
Fuck, me tooüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
*tier 3 sound effect plays*
---
Not for the most survivors 
---
Lmao. Just noticed this
---
That last one was a joke.
---
Ah, I see. But wouldn't having a Kindred-est ability by default weaken Kindred and ruin some tactics killers have for autistic survivors? Camping on its own isn't a bad thing, it's just an overused tactic that isn't very fun for both sides.
---
It's completely unintuitive though. Why have a UI or ranking feature that's only relevant if the killer brings 1 specific perk out of 54? It's a weird bandaid when clearly the issue lies elsewhere.
---
Guys my uber driver is facecamping me what do i do
---
Damn you ruined it
---
Meg?
---
That's horrifying haha. 
---
probably not, people who facecamp do not care about BP.  Its all about the degradation 
---
Trappers basement
---
Most survivors dont play cautious unless they know the killer is around. No reason to not focus on generators if you dont know.
---
LOL if the new toxic killer meta is slugging and staring at a body for 60 seconds I'm so in, it's going to be so much fun humiliating them.
---
Even irl killers using ruin? I'd hate to be a generator tech
---
Imma cleanse it immediately
---
Easy fix, once exit gates are powered, the bloodpoint changes don‚Äôt take effect.
---
It‚Äôs a crutch. I‚Äôve been seeing it less in higher ranks recently tbh. So many better perks you can take instead of DS. 
---
im rank 15 and the killer was rank 4 becouse my friends where at rank 7
---
It can now only be used within 60 seconds of being unhooked, it's pretty much an anti-tunneling (chasing after a survivor that was just unhooked and injured) perk, this naturally pisses off half of the survivor community cause they don't get a free escape. I see this change as good for both sides, punishing the killer for tunneling while not giving the survivor a free escape. Even though tunneling is considered a dirty tactic, i think it's perfectly fine to do.
---
Return the Slab
---
It's probably like the same 10 people shilling it.
---
Reminds me of a similar match I had as the Wraith, on this same map. In short, Nea tried to be toxic but disconnected after I downed her. Got another survivor and brought them down into the basement, and the other two tried to make a rescue attempt but were terribly at hiding.
---
That match took less than seven minutes to be done with.
---
100% canon 
---
I am sure this idea can be improved if the bp a killer loses depends of the timing of the match or even the proximity to the hooked survivor. In that case, for example, after the gates are opened, you don't lose bp if you are an specific amount of metres away even if you are not so far of the hooked, but you lose bp if you are facecamping.
---
0 to 2 gens done: 2 bp lost for x metres next to the camped every second, 2+x bp lost if you facecamp.
---
3-5 gens done: 1 bp lost for x metres next to the camped every second, 1+x bp lost if you facecamp.
---
Gates opened: 0 bp lost for x metres  next to the camped to 4 metres, less of 4 metres you lose 1 bp for every second you camp or facecamp.
---
I think that could work :-)
---
Eh, I usually just run a toxic build if they seem like they‚Äôre going to be annoying. (Like MYC-mint rag hag or impossible skillchecks doctor.) I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Moris since it‚Äôs points you lose for not hooking people. Only one I bring is the green one on the rare occasion that I run dying light.
---
Just seems like a non issue to me altogether. Yawn.
---
While that could work, most people would abuse this mechanic by running NOED and just waiting for endgame and while I dont have much hatred for the perk, I see enough people complaining about NOED already.
---
It‚Äôs some kids test! I died when I saw it lol
---
That's my approach too. I will try to get the rescuer, but if they somehow disappeared then I'll punt the hooked person back on the ground and move on.
---
I don't want the hooked person to get their second hook just because their teammate wanted their "we're gonna live forever" stack, but if I can't find the rescuer then I still want the survivors to waste some time on the hook that I put hard work into.
---
The Shape is Michael Myers but the Pigs name is Amanda. 
---
I wish all the survivors who complain about camping would just play killer and try camping to see how terrible a strategy lt is, while also teaching those survivors how to beat a camping killer. 
---
Hillbilly is still able to be looped unlike nurse
---
I think it is better than anything at all.
---
Plus if you also grant these bp to the survivor you are camping (means you are "transfering them to him) may be even better
---
yea they really need to just take input from the people who are good at the game like streamers.
---
I feel the surprise that comes with NOED is what makes it fun. You're never quite sure if the killer has it or not. Makes it have a bit of tension in what is supposed to be a horror game.
---
You can't say that you must hate Ochido because it's meta 
---
More like when the PTBEE starts...
---
I've never used it.
---
I had this last weekend. I think I was playing as trapper (for my daily ritual)
---
I personally use most of them almost immediately because it rarely gets to end game, usually because of the traps. Most of the time I get good RNG and it takes survivors a long time to get their traps off and I snowball it from there. Doesn‚Äôt always work out though so I like to have at least one left but yeah.
---
Or a bee.
---
That's not at all what you did whether it was intentional or not.
---
r/dbdgonewild üëÖüí¶
---
So then why does every killer and their grandma run it over something that isn't "supereasy" to do.
---
The whole "Diversity for diversity's sake" argument is so stupid seeing as, like, Indian people exist, so it's MORE realistic for them to be in the game. It's even funnier when people say "What's next? A black lesbian in a wheelchair!?" implying that there aren't in fact black lesbians who have to use wheelchairs out there in the world.. 
---
Obviously in this game they wouldn't fit (for gameplay purposes), but there always seems to be the hidden "2 steps away" rule that even the most diverse people use, where a straight white able bodied young man is the default, and only 2 of those can be changed at maximum for the character to remain "realistic".
---
Disabled woman? Only 2 steps away. Chinese gay man? 2 steps away. Old woman? 2 steps away. Add in an old indian deaf man and that's THREE steps away, which makes him UNREALISTIC!
---
WOOOSH
---
I thought open handed would only benefit survivors seeing the aura 
---
hahaha  
---
oh I do dislike him. didn't know anything about him and was watching him by random. then I was like... wow who is this dick ? bye!!
---
I really try, but I also need to look forward haha
---
At least you got your daily ritual, right? Was it for chasing?
---
Actually it was for ‚Äúhitting 4 survivors in post phase state‚Äù but uh....I didn‚Äôt do that. So free blood points I guess ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
It works, instead of being 8 meters from a hooked person it extends to 16 meters. 
---
Yea I genuinely believe there is a bug with them. One reason I don‚Äôt use pig as often.
---
Maybe you got it the game before the t pose and just didn't collect it?
---
it's not just a rock, squidward! it- wait, no it is a rock
---
Not to mention there's plenty of other ethnicities that are yet to be in the game, too. Indians and Hispanics come to mind specifically.
---
TBH I dont think the change was necessary, now its like  orrowed time with a small chance of ever working.
---
Depends. I usually work my way up to red rank survivor each month, but i still have a number of survivors that are low character level. One of my dailies might require one of my underleveled survivors, but I go ahead and do it anyway, even if I only have a couple perks.
---
I like to do that whenever I see a ".tv" in a username or something similar. In my experience as a surv twitchers tend to be the most useless teammates, so I take it out on them as killer if I can
---
That's the thing, there's no such "whatever reason". That's what makes Myers scary and different, the lack of any motivation other than just evil. He doesn't kill every single person he crosses path with, theres no way to know if X person is going or live or die.
---
That was a terrifying scene. When he just stares at the crib.
---

---
2nd try? I had to do about 5 trials!
---
Yes exactly! As a brown person who is not black, I would love to have at least *one* character to identify with, although I know it won‚Äôt happen for me (I‚Äôm not from a community that is widely present in North America) I‚Äôm happy to have other diverse brown characters! 
---
I like how even The Bee is definitely OP, no one has even called for a nerf. The Bee is how BHVR should model all their killers after from here on out. 
---
Difference is that bt is usable
---
If you mean what i think you mean, shadowborn exists as well and is probably the better of the two for one killer
---
Compared to without ruin or to gentapping? I'd wager it's about 20-50% slower than normal, really depends on your luck with skillchecks, but it's faster than tapping.
---
Gotta get rid of em red bars.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Could be multiple reasons. Most likely is they are playing a killer they haven‚Äôt leveled up and don‚Äôt have perks. Another is they could be de ranking and trying to make it obvious or just bored. 
---
No there‚Äôs no benefit for running less perks.
---
Suck my dick
---
I assume to *flex* or brag. There's a few survivors and killers on xbox that like to run no perks.
---
...Ok? You're original point of this not being a nerf is still wrong. Nerfing and Buffing things IS balancing. Saying something is a "balance" but not a "nerf" is just dumb. And very wrong.
---
What is different?
---
1 or 2 perks? There is literally not a single benefit to this.
---
Its most likely people leveling some characters or just messing around with weird ideas to challenge themself. 
---
They might just be doing a daily ritual on a low level survivor
---
Yeah, it would make sense if they were prestiged, and as said in the other post, it would make the game that much more challenging. Have read elsewhere about not using add-ons for the nurse when playing with her for the first few times, to be able to get to grips with her blink. Might have to step my game up and try fewer perks.. 
---
You traced this, asshole

In what world is that true? I use it all the time, when the exit gates are open it's one of the best perks.

Moderately reduce survivors action speed when in the dream world.
---
&gt; if you have a key and 2 gens done... hatch is available with 2 people alive.  
---
Sweet summer child you are going to have a lot of difficulty trying to find the hatch that way
---
that's a beautiful picture. the details are amazing, you could swear you were ingame.
---
Long you find your obsession then Fire Up + PWYF is a great gimmick with max stacks as long as you have EW2 nearly full. No body was capable of even near running away.

---
That's not a counter.
---
By that logic the counter to NOED would be "just don't get hit when gates are powered"
---
That said NOED doesn't so much need a nerf as cleansing dull totems needs to be incentivised, rn NOED is literally the only reason you would ever cleanse a dull totem, and that's a bad mechanic.
---
DS didn't so much get a nerf as it got a rework, it can still be a ridiculously strong perk (to the point of making Borrowed Time almost obsolete) and in fact lost the only real counterplay it had (juggling and downing while really close to a hook) and is now just as strong when you aren't the obsession. 
---
THIS IS WHAT SHE HAS TRAINED FOR
---

That depends on the rank tbh. Both Freddy perks are not worth it imo. I usually take bitter murmur, ruin, brutal  strength, and fire up. Is my build good? No, but I like it

Everyone in the theater fell silent during that scene. It was really cool.
---
Another person answered me. I was asking about the add-ons.
---
Yeah. At my theater too.
---
Totally, that's what makes me excited. Toxic facecampers are going to waste even more time failing at the game. 
---
I've done it many times and when you realize how dumb you are you'll see.
---
I'm willing to bet it's because you posted and admitted to doing the prestige glitch to every possible character, with screenshots YOU took and then posted in the ps4 community while bragging and carrying onto saying that "I don't care if they ban me I need a break anyways." in the replies to the comments that were being made.
---
I seen your posts but I didn't care enough to report you for it but I'm sure a few others took the time and advantage you gave them to do it. 
---
Evan is a brute though. Myers is much more of a sophisticated bad boy
---
Yeah he just likes killing. Nothing more to it than that. He kills a little boy in the 2018 one it's not like he's particularly concerned with any reasons.
---
Lol. Did they actually say next teaser at 11 or is that a part od the joke?
---
I think they should create an offering that spawns an extra staircase to the basement. This kinda helps survivors and killers by adding multiple escape routes for the survivors and multiple entrances for the killers
---
That is a myth and a stereotype. Although the original movie did make it seem like teenagers were punished for being sexual, that is not the case. It's been confirmed numerous times that they got killed because they were busy and not being careful (by having sex), but not BECAUSE they were sexual.
---
Killer d/c‚Äôs
---
hm, i suppose you are right on that
---
BBQ and chili for Tombstone Myers? Or are you talking about the adept achievement
---
I wanted to make it as complicated sounding as possible. Also I'm basing this on if they're going for adept
---
You‚Äôre excused. 
---
That build is nasty when it works. You could even swap out Ruin for Monitor and Abuse for extra tracking if you're confident you'll be able to get enough hits on your obsession without Ruin. I've had some good success with M+A on Freddy by looking down to break the chase and then sneaking up on the survivor when they think I'm gone. 
---
We just have super different experiences then, with Billy i always makes sure im in an open area, before i commit to picking up a DS and not dribble. Gone through 4 stacks of DS using that method and regularly get 4ks. Its all about knowing the map and making smart decisions. Counters exist in many forms, and with enduring the fact you dont have to respect pallets either make survivor options limited. Paired with spirit fury, DS is only good for a few seconds, and along with it the longer they stay up the more pallets go. So even if you dont get them immediately it all plays into end game where they can really only run for windows but a wrong move means death with no pallets. IMO DS is a wasted perk due to my killer experience with it.
---
The point of tunneling somebody that has a RBT on is that you know they are going to B-line for a Jigsaw box which allows them to easily find that player and down them because they probably haven't healed at all seeing as they are time pressured to get it off. 
---
Poor Mumen Rider never catches a break
---
Yeah, I know. M+A with red paintbrush is a 0m terroraduis, wich means that you'll always see  survivors aura in the dream world, it works great
---
I know, that's why it's a bad idea to run tombstone Myers, as you almost guarantee yourself to lose 2 pink add-ons (as it takes around 2 1/2 of the survivors "stalk" out of 4 survivors) unless you play in low rank (15-20) then it could *maybe* work
---
Seriously though, just gen tap if you can't hit ruin skillchecks.
---
Can you not turn the camera around on console?
---
the fact that survivors had 5 perks instead of 4.
---
NO !
---
I'll try that, Ty :)
---
Also:
---
* lockers (as you said)
---
* getting in tr (or just 40m)
---
* siting behind a gen
---
* running one direction then going back to fake out the killer
---
* being in a strong loop spot and letting yourself be seen (if the killer goes for you, if your good at looping it takes tones of pressure of your possibly trash team)
---
* Distortion (also hurts NC)
---
BBQ probs has the most non-perk based counter play (and it still has distortion) of any perk in the game.
---
How much we talking ?
---
The only change I'd make it to replace PGTW with Discordance as you'd know where you need to apply pressure the most.
---
The problem now with NOED is, that people think it's unfair that killers, that don't have enough skill to get kills throughout the game get to slug people easily and get kills off of it. Whether NOED can be easily countered or not is not a discussion I want to introduce, but I want to point out the communities view here. With your idea (which is kind of interesting) you'd encourage exactly that. You let the killer start with the FULL power of the HEX, instead of letting him EARN the power (if the totem isn't destroyed before that). Another issue is with Ruin for example. For each totem there is 1% penalty reduction (and I know it's just an example), but imagining cleansing 5 totems before getting rid of ruin is time consuming as hell and who says you'd even get to that point anyway?
---
I think the totems are fine as they are and more important things need to be addressed.
---
It was almost top tier when it came out tho. But Registeel all the way ;)
---
Have to agree, the current progression system is just too easy, for both sides.  Black pip basically ensures that even if you get one hooked, you won't depip.  Not sure what you mean about safe hooks, as if the survivor goes down within 10s (the games definition of a safe hook) you lose emblem points.  Perhaps they need to extend that timer, as a killer who hits the rescuer first and the chases down the hooked survivor will probably not be quick enough to down them to make it count as a farm.  I can agree that survivors who run BT and just run at the hook are the worst, they're guaranteed their 'safe unhook' points even if it screws you over.
---
A better ranking and MMR system would help a lot to keep the game interesting, killing potatoes gets old real quick, and  playing with potatoes is hair-pullingly frustrating.
---
I mean, that ruin example is exactly my intention for this suggestion.  It extends the game, giving more freedom for the killer to chase, something that most people, survivors and killers, enjoy.  The Ruin example was that you could choose to power through it (as you can now), or you can find totems.  For each totem you find, you are rewarded, and you can stop looking for totems and go back on gens at anytime, now with an easier time for it.  As it is now, you have to find the specific totem to cleanse ruin, and after you do it completely negates an entire perk.  With this idea, you would spend less time finding a specific totem, and just cleansing any would weaken ruin, while also not invalidating an entire perk.  It gives survivors more tactical options, whilst also not punishing the killer for bad RNG.
---
That's why I only play spirit.
---
NOT ALL CLAUDETTES! 
---
imo whilst wraith *can* use it, a windstorm addon (Even yellow) does the same but much better without needing stacks, hes best off with perks to help him snowball or chase directly.
---
Being facecamped at the end of a game is normal.
---
Just kick it over! 
---
Why. 
---
Unfortunately, the ranking system was more strict when it first deployed. Now, I'm not saying it was perfect or that it still indicated a skilled player from someone who isn't, but it was definitely harder to rank up than the current situation.
---
Very quickly, high ranked killers could not find games. Killer queue time issues are nothing new but this was on another level. The survivor player base wasn't ranking up to keep up with killers which meant a shit ton of empty lobbies waiting for players who didn't exist, in terms of "acceptable" matchmaking. 
---
So they made things easier all around and we end up with the system we have today. Which is still better than the 7k BP/10K BP point standards for survivor and Killer point cube. It's not good, but it's better. 
---
Unfortunately, with the recent weirdness in matchmaking from their tests, I'm wondering if they're thinking of just abolishing ranks altogether. Trying to see if the upset from horribly mis-matched games offsets quicker lobby times.

---
Dude it's not even been tried yet, behave. 
---
I said i wait for an open area to normally pick up and not dribble. If i commit to eat it which i do 95% of the time it usually takes a whole 10 seconds to knock back down and continue as normal. And if there's multiple DS then so be it, enduring always makes it end the same way. I dont fear DS because i know what the end product is after DS with enduring. DS is only strong against those with no plan and those afraid of wasting so much time without enduring. I run it exclusively just hoping DS is in play because of how fast im able to redown them and put them on a hook like normal and now they have only 3 perks for the rest of the game. DS is far from god tier, maybe so against less experience but from my personal experience it is only top in annoyance and nothing more. I brought up spirit fury as a counter to your "survivor will find another pallet or window" being as pallets really aren't a big deal with it and they slow themselves down just to be downed almost immediately after. DS has never killed a single game for me, and adrenaline is only wasted when they cant get all 5 gens done is it not? And dead hard is in the same category as DS, if youre experienced against it what more does it do for a survivor than gain a few more seconds to just be downed a few feet further regardless. Waiting out a DH is not that hard and can be argued wasted if the killer knows just to wait everytime. I know what top tiers are, but regardless they are all perks with counters to them. Whether it be waiting an extra second or two, dribbling, getting totems down, or just running a direct counter perk. Again our experiences are obviously very different, but i personally have never had a game derailed due to DS even when its a 4 stack of them. Id say a majority of games where i dont get a 4k its due to the hatch with 1 or 2 gens still not completed. The last time i can remember escapes from the gates themselves is when i change killers from spirit or billy because im not that great at them and dont have the time in them to utilize them to max potential as i can spirit and billy.

that would be an option but imo both killers i play with (pig and wraith) are not meant to long chases, I only go for a chase I know I can win very quickly. Most chases I just break 1 or 2 pallets and give up, their moment will come. 
---
I love your style! So cute 
---
You should draw Feng min  and Myers XD 
---
YOU MEAN THE WRUMBUMBUM? YOU GET THAT AS WELL WITH KILLER I THINK
---
Watt are you doing?  Trying to jump-start a pun train?
---
at my theatre too
---
*laughs in Freddy and Friendly Neighbor*
---
Oh yeah. I'm not thinking straight today, I guess.
---
What was he supposed to do? Camping at the end is normal
---
It might have been at every theater.
---
You failed
---
I don‚Äôt use it because I honestly just never liked the perk. I‚Äôd rather run supportive perks like Bond and Prove Thyself in that slot.
---
Nice idea.
---
I thought you were gonna say, increase generator speed according to how close the killer is standing to the hooked survivor. I think that would be a cool perk.
---
Something like:
---
Increase repair speed by 10/20/30% when the killer is within 4/8/12 metres of a hooked survivor. 
---
This perk is only active when there are no other survivors within 10 metres of the hooked survivor.
---
That way, the killer isn't "camping" if he is trying to kill someone who happens to be close.
---
Common perk vs unique killer perk, it's a risk I'm willing to take. There's always counter plays.
---
The camping was legitimate,the discord bullshit is weird af
---
There are already pro&amp;anti camping features in the game. Camping is a tool with its own pros and cons.
---
this build is so much fun, without doubt my favorite freddy build. 
---
Love this
---
Whispers?
---
Oh for fuck's sake! I should have known there would be some sort of catch like that. I've got half a mind to leave a nasty Yelp review! 
---
bzzzzz
---
I think it's definitely a problem from BHVR having to heavily nerf STBFL from it's release form. For clarity:
---
&gt;You become obsessed with one Survivor. As long as your Obsession is alive:
---
&gt; *The cooldown of missed attacks is decreased by 14/18/20%. 
---
&gt; *The cooldown of successful attacks is decreased by 25/29/33%. 
---
And thats it. No tokens, no requirements other than the Obsession living, just a straight attack reduction that stacked with the at-the-time recently buffed version of Unrelenting if you weren't worried about the Adept achievement:
---
&gt;You recuperate faster from any attack made with your main weapon. 
---
&gt;* The cool-down of missed attacks is reduced by 16/22/30%. 
---
* The cool-down of successful attacks is decreased by 10/16/22%.
---
I can kind of see what they were going for. PWYF was originally 5/6/7% movement speed boost as well. So you'd be playing Myers, and you'd want to preferably stalk mainly your obsession. Build up your meter a little bit, let them get away. Repeat and build up PWYF stacks and get close to EW 3. Then go find the rest of the team and just wreck them when you pop EW 3 and have 21% extra movement speed. And if you had to end up killing your obsession and turn off two of  your perks, then at least Dying Light  gave you something back.
---
Instead it worked more like you were a proto-Legion. Just go power walk into chop-chop-chop-chop. 
---
But you're dead on with your analysis. In reality this ends up being a huge conflicting mess no matter what you do. Even if they are choices that benefit you in some manner, it never feels good to take one choice or the other.
---
The original Jason (aka Jason's mother) killed promiscuous teenagers because them fooling around is what lead her son to die in the first place.
---
Jason kills out of some bizarre devotion to his mother.
---
**quit life**
---
Escape now
---
We're sorry you had an unfavorable time at Entity Realm, we can offer you a complimentary Entitee shirt and a 20 Entidollar voucher usable for a future visit.
---
Where tho, why tho, how tho, and what tho?
---
Thats why you must be as stealthy as you can. Survivors do not know I will regress their generator 25% plus the overcharge skill check, so even if they hide, they'll stay close to that gen waiting me to leave, to continue working on it. PGTW is only active for 30s i guess, that's a very powerfull  perk imo, but as soon as you hook someone, you must know right away which gen you will be regressing, you cant trust on luck. Thats why BBQ and PGTW work so well together, it tells you 2 things: location of survivors and wich gen you must tap in order to put pressure. 
---
As I said in the OP, my tatic is do not lose time at infinite chases. If in a chase of 30 seconds I break 1/2 pallets and leave someone injuried, thats fine. Bamboozle is indeed a good perk, but I rather to choose wich chase will I go for instead of go for them all and run all the chase helping perks. While you're chasing 1, 3 are doing gens, unpressured. 
---
I do not like ruin. It indeed "slow the game down just a little bit", but it can be destroyed very fast, some toolboxes are "imune" to it,  and put me a lot of pressure to find someone before the hex is destroyed - wich I already know its just a matter of time.  Haunted Grouds - very situational for me.  Waste 1 slot to give you 60 seconds to down a survivor of a game with an average time of 10/15 minutes and MAYBE hook 1 survivor out of 12 hooks max you can do in a trial, I think it's more fun than an effective perk. 
---
At least they said gg
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs quite my issue, but I understand what you‚Äôre getting at. 
---
I tested it on another game and I stutter step in the same position. -.-
---
I said the same thing. It really bothers me, especially me being a pizza delivery driver, but maybe pizza works different in the enity‚Äôs realm. 
---
I'm pretty sure ds can only be used if the unhooked survivor is downed and picked up again withing 60 seconds of being unhooked, so no he shouldn't be hit with it
---
so I got back into the game yesterday after playing a few rounds last werk have been subbed to here still and saw some of the hate against legion.. why? I played 5 games against him yesterday and he's by far the weakest of all killers.. I mean you just do gens, this asshole comes running by, stabs you and then leaves so you mend and continue and when he tunnels you just find 2 close jungle gyms and he is powerless if you manage to dodge the first rage... is he annoying bc he's bad? annoying bc he's a stabby boi without chases? 
---
I genuinely want to know.. 
---
Uhhh ruin is a unique killer perk too....soooo. There is no counter play to haunted grounds. You either guess right or wrong. 
---
As you‚Äôve seen, a lot of people say the same thing about Decisive being for bad survivors 
---
How about....
---
Making pipping harder
---
Add end of season rewards for those who reach rank 1 (or even red ranks if it becomes really difficult) 
---
Man, I hate this bug. (Doctor here).
---
He‚Äôs got absolutely no wst. 
---
Well I mean if someone was being a dick I have no reason to be nice back. If a guy was just playing and stuff I have no reason to ruin an awesome moment for them.
---
Hmmm, I'd be careful to jump to conclusions which team is working harder. Some things take more time. And you don't usually see how much work goes into a software project, especially since you don't really see "progress" but rather the final solution and nothing in between. So we don't really know how hard the team is working on debugging the game right now.
---
And you kindaaaa implied that you'd rather have the design team work on debugging with your first comment. In any case, I strongly disagree.
---
and as a horror fan, it's fun seeing your favorite movie characters in the same game. Because of the shitshow of the lawsuit and the Friday game being dead, I do hope they can get Jason eventually.
---
Yes, you can wait 40-60 seconds, which is a damn long time to be waiting. 
---
I mean i'm not saying new DS will be OP or anything but it is definitely not as easy as just calling it a nerf. Old DS had a different function and different ways of dealing with it, old DS was almost undoubtedly better *on the obsession* but if you have multiple DS's on a match chances are you will be better off with new DS if you aren't the obsession. 
---
People are complaining about slugging, but by the time the killer does it another gen is done
---
I agree. Enduring eats ds up, making it dangerous if the survivor isn't next to a pallet or vault. Especially at any tier below tier 3 ds. There are also places where you can block survivors into, in order to make them get off your shoulder in a position where they can't run out of, making the perk wasted. 
---
I think ds is only powerful if it's a swf team where all the players are actually good, coordinated, and all land ds (though, at that point, they probably don't even need ds). 
---
He has a guarantee BP with at least one hook. If he did that bad I don‚Äôt fault him. The guy who got camped was just salty he got downed so late. 
---
Are you being downvoted for being the only one who spelled La Llorona correctly? 
---
I mean it causes damage to your controllers on the left analog stick. thus increasing how big your dead zone needs to be without drift. most non shooter games don't have dead zone settings. hell I don't think call of duty even has them
---
How about we just rework kindered and make it base
---
Madre me think of his power as summoning rats or the plague given ghost's last album
---
Nobody cares your horrible advertising
---
No one wants to see your self promotion
---
Nope, just seeing people who either aren't knowingly playing her poorly or just don't care and would rather easily confirm a kill because jigsaw boxes make survivors easier to spot
---
He also doesn't kill any of the other mental ward patients when he escapes. I don't think he'd kill go out of his way to kill anyone that wouldn't even be aware that he killed them or that they were dying. The guy dresses up as a bed sheet ghost to stab someone, carves people's head into jack o lanterns, and stares at his kills after doing it, so he's getting some kind of enjoyment out it. Killing something that can't properly fear for its life or put up a struggle must seem boring.
---
You sure downed us real fair and square with the exceptionally fair hitboxes that are currently in the game.
---
r/bonehurtingjuice
---
That is not camping he is just making sure he dies. Survivors wants free escape but killers job is to kill and survivor shouldn‚Äôt teach killer how to play at end lol.
---
I was actually in a match, and someone had their player name as "Raw me daddy Myer" and the first thing I thought was "this bitch needs some psychological help."
---
So you run enduring exclusively for DS? Yikes. You made a cool meme thingy and it just isn‚Äôt true, sorry. DS in current form is a god tier perk and forces you to build and play around it. 
---
Don‚Äôt question it just cleanse it 
---
I mean people justify it by saying the killer needs it, not the person playing the killer. 
---
"Freddy needs it to be playable" that sort of jazz.
---
The it's for bad players argument is just garbage in general, if a "noob perk" gives you an advantage at higher levels of play it's just a strong perk.
---
Well, yeah you're right, it's not proper counterplay. At that point just hit great skill checks (or run Stake Out maybe) if you don't want to hit totems, like if you know it's spirit or you somehow know they're stacking hexes. It's complicated, but if it weren't everyone would have the same four perks I guess.
---
Its like playing against a good nurse without the skill or ability to juke. You can't be impressed on how well they are doing as they are just abusing an exploit. And if the legion isn't brain-dead you can't juke them.
---
I would but I don‚Äôt have it 
---
Hmmm... maybe I did it previously on a salty day... both of my controllers seems to have that issue 
---
Ok Christ man I just wanted to show people my build that I liked I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs your problem but calm down buddy I can post what i want
---
Never had any issues happen to my account whenever I played on PTB. 
---
Yeah i guess seeing if its the spirit is one counter to Haunter Grounds but besides that theres no real way to know. The flame should be like slihhtly brighter or dimmer or something that only a keen eye would pick up on.
---
The problem with DS was that it was basically a free health state that 99% of the time couldn't be countered and was going to activate at some point during the game, and a three hit chase is often enough to completely reset the killer's momentum. Meanwhile, gens are fast enough that a momentum reset like that is abso-fucking-lutely devastating.
---
The problem with NOED is that it freely *ignores* a health state, and - outside of SWF and one really mediocre/situational perk that will be a wasted perk slot in most of your games - no one ever knows if they've done enough to counter it. I don't how many totems my teammates Jack, Jill, and Stupid have done. Even when the last gen pops and finally NOED activates, I still don't know if we've successfully countered the NOED the killer may or may not be running. You don't even know when to stop looking for totems because who knows how many your teammates have done. That lack of information makes NOED *impractical* to counter unless you're SWF. Countering NOED is a team effort, and solo survivors can't actually coordinate and play like a team.
---
And after that the next big problem is adrenaline, which is a free health state survivors get for having a close game. Like, WTF? "Look, ma, I'm playing the game the way I'm supposed to! Yay, free health!" Adrenaline can easily turn a 3K into a 1K for no particular reason and the only counter is for the killer to have an utterly dominating victory. "Don't have close games" isn't a counter. That's like giving someone the advice to "be Lebron James."
---
And after that you have shit like instaheals, ebony mori's, iridescent head, etc, etc. And thankfully those are all much, much rarer. But they all either effectively add or ignore health states, and they're fucking broken because of it.
---
Basically anything that takes a situation which is balanced around normal health states, and then adds or removes a health state, is broken as fuck. Because fucking obviously. If you want something to instadown, it has to be balanced around the idea of instadowning from the start. Compare Myer's T3 vs NOED. Myer's T3 you give up hits over the course of the game to build meter so you can instadown later. NOED you just randomly get to start instadowning people. Myer's T3 is balanced. NOED is bullshit. Now imagine if NOED announced itself at the start of the game and survivors knew how many totems were left. It would just be a slightly better, more consistent ruin - slow the game down just a lil' bit. And it would be a nerf to NOED that made it more fair to solo survivors and way less of a game of russian roulette.
---
We have Feng tho
---
If I end up right I want my 10 karma back /s
---
A really simple change would be to just change what kind of items survivors can use. For example Dwight can only find Toolboxes, Flashlights and Keys in his bloodwebs.
---
That way you can both add new items to the game without overflowing survivors bloodwebs and finally give survivors a way to distinguish themselves.
---
Oh please, that‚Äôs either a ping issue or Huntress‚Äôs absurd hitboxes. That‚Äôs not the killer‚Äôs fault.

Look at it like the saw films? There picked to play a game. If they lose they die. 
---
I think an Indian survivor would be good. There is so much potential with Indian myths and stuff for a related killer too. Also an Indian map would be cool. Like a temple map. I think Indian architecture looks cool sometimes.
---
I think thats kind of the point. Save the best for last and play with your food require to keep your obsession alive while dying light requires you to kill them asap. I think this is because save the best for last and play with your food give you incentive to keep your obsession alive by providing benefits, but if the situation arises where you think itd be better to kill off your obsession early, you don't lose 3 perks, you lose 2 and 1 perk is activated. Basically, it's so that you still get benefits even when your obsession is dead (if you're running all 3 perks)
---
I wouldn't say play with your food and save the best for last actually go against eachother though, as all you have to do to gain a token for play with your food is activate a chase, even if it last a second. You don't need to hit them, so you don't lose the benefits of save the best for last. Ideally, you occasionally activate chase with your obsession but don't swat at them, instead, going for people that may be around them.
---
This game ain't made for your sexual fantasies you horny ass niggas
---
Yup this is what I was thinking and walk away because in real life you use your feet and not your hands to pull it apart slowly lol.
---
It's because if you listen to the sound track, they're all part of the same "song", making transitions easy because they were naturally made to lead into eachother
---
u/saiiyu 
---
Detective taand Bill are the only dead survivor chosen, the others are just randomly abducted
---
I kinda figured it was something like that, thanks for a full explanation though.
---
I believe they somehow entered into the Entity's world alive and once there they're stuck forever repeating trials until all their hope is lost, at which point they are thrown to the void I believe
---
could try pulling L3 out and pushing it back in a few times. either you're pushing your controller too hard or there's dirt in there.
---
https://youtu.be/1TxEdJaZkY4

(If you wanna listen to it fully)
---
Killers casually chase other survivors for the duration of three to four minutes, it‚Äôs not too far fetched to simply wait or start another chase 
---
I think that are at the brink of death, like seconds away from dying, and the entity takes them. 
---
Are you kidding? I NEED my 600 BP!
---
I will try that next time ty!
---
What if there‚Äôs no pizza inside? What if it‚Äôs just the entity waiting to kill whoever opens it? 
---
What if the box is actually delivering Dwight?????
---
If I catch someone wearing this - they are SO getting facecamped exactly because of this

[***PLACE A SOAP STONE FENG, THE KILLER IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU***](/intensifies)

Freddy jump scare? I need to see this.
---
I understand she'll be a really cool dancer.
---
Bill was taken after he died if his trailer is anything to go by, Tapp was likely the same according to his backstory. However, Benedict Baker, Jeff Johansen, Kate Denson, and Quentin Smith were all 100% alive at the time of being 'chosen' so not every Survivor was chosen at death. 
---
Most of the other Survivors are just teleported to the Fog without a trace, with nary a word specifically being said about their living or dead status before being grabbed. 
---
Basically you can believe what you want, but most of them were probably alive when they got grabbed.
---
You can but only in store, click the character and drag
---
There‚Äôs only 2 explicitly dead survivors. In terms of characters like Laurie or something canonically when they were taken (Laurie being her 17 year old variation from the original Halloween) she‚Äôs not dead. 
---
What's up the prepubescent girls in the background giggling?
---
I think we will get something today, another picture most likely. Why would they post something Tuesday and then nothing for the rest of the week? It wouldn‚Äôt make sense
---
Well, generally you want to try lunging through pallets, because the stun really isn't that big of a deal so you either don't hit them and not really lose much or get a free hit and get rid of a pallet. "Respecting" a pallet (backing up when you get to a pallet to avoid the stun) doesn't akways work as good survivors will use that to their advantage and loop you for longer 
---
I only play survivor and I like going against nurse. It forces you to play differently. Don‚Äôt vault, instead mind game rhe nurse into thinking you are so they blink towards the pallet/window, and instead turn to a different direction when you hear her screech. It‚Äôs all about trying to predict the blinks and juke. It‚Äôs hard, but rewarding when you do it right. 
---
I‚Äôd take about 5 secs to cleanse not 30
---
That would explain why today suck hex: ruin my day
---
Yea, just run forward and Doctor is fucked xD
---
Agree, especially cause the socks 
---
i agree but she says in that comment that they were doing dev streams with no real info to give yet today would be the perfect day to do a dev stream cuz they have a whole new chapter and update/ptb coming very soon so i dunno how i feel about no dev stream today and if that may mean no teaser either :( we shall see.
---
Or take your chances. The choice is yours. 
---
I personally let them go when they get stuck due to glitch. Well... More like give them a head start. They can wiggle out, and I'll let them get out of view, and then it's back to playing normally again. It just feels cheap to get a hook that way.
---
Maybe. Didnt know that was an achievement 
---
The pizza is aggressive. 
---
Up until about three or four weeks ago, I never even touched the perk. But after so many games in a row of being camped and/or tunneled, I started using it. It's legit made games so much more enjoyable for me.
---
I don't know what that is but I'll upvote you.
---
i', high ranked on both, and sometimes I get a daily for things like my lvl 1 clown or lvl 1 dwight. So I just go in as them and get them done. SO not so much bragging rights as in I dont wanna waste bp on a daily.
---
Does it make me a bad person if I thought it was disappointing that he didn't kill the baby? Like he's supposed to be pure evil but he spares a baby for... Reasons. Should have just stabbed the crib and had the baby cries cut out. Didnt have to show anything, would have been a good shock to the audience imo. 
---
It was the killers fault for playing the game, back then you could see survivors ranks in pre game.
---
Congratulations üëç
---
No we can't and won't. Killers got Freddy now shut up and tolerate your weak link.
---
I always kind of hated how people tried to rationalize his muderous tendecies or said think Loomis was "being mean :(" when he said Michael was evil. This man spent eight years trying to connect with Michael and he couldn't any semblance of guilt or emotions of out of him. 
---
Michael Myers is pure evil with zero care for anyone and that's what makes it so scary and great.
---
In a "horror game" that most of us probably stopped being scared of a long time ago, it's nice to have some genuine scares again 
---
All credits to him to be honest. He was the one who made my day.
---
Like I said, all they have to do is drop of picture of the new map or the killer and that will keep people talking until Monday 
---
Have you not played recently? They've broken hitboxes/vaults.
---
IS THE WORD 'NEIN' CAUSE HE IS GERMAN?!
---
Does it matter? We all use the same 10 or so meta perks anyways.
---
Idk. I thought it was just a dumb funny moment to share. 
---
Oh so that was real? I thought it was legit just a shitpost.
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to ask you to snap out of it
---
Why would anyone waste time playing the PTB and give feedback to the devs that they aren't going to read. Remember the staircase desync bug people were complaining about on Ormond Lodge? Still there btw.
---
I'd rather just let the content creators sit in queue forever 
---
If you cleanse it you better get 600 dollars lol
---
Speak up, I can't understand you due to all the stale jizz stuck to the roof of your mouth.
---
Your downvotes. x'D
---
You mean for Haunted grounds? Huh. Didn't know you could see a difference. I'll have to keep an eye out. Thanks for the fun fact!
---
Bush lives matter

nononono im saying it should be not that it is lol right now its exactly the same as a normal hex totem lol
---
Get good
---
KILLERS ARE MORE TOXIC THAN SURVIVORS YET DEVS CONSTANTLY CATER TO THEIR WHINING 
---
*Oh, I know. I just wanted to make it all about dat ass*
---
Honestly, I think it‚Äôs because the killer has placed a trap on the survivor and wants them to die quickly, so she doesn‚Äôt allow them to take the trap off. The killer gets points for trap kills, so why would she? Yes, it‚Äôs unfair and annoying, but it happens. I‚Äôm a survivor main and I understand your frustration. 
---
I love how the killer complained about her as well
---
There is being immersed and then there is literally crouching in a corner doing nothing. Pretty big difference.
---
Why lobby dodge? Why do people get so scared of losing a game? 
---
Be quiet.
---
&gt;Do you mean it takes longer to find a lobby or find  a match? I'll usually dodge the lobby if I suspect an SWF, a lot of ~~killers~~ noobs do the same. When they switch to dedicated servers it'll be harder to identify, so you might have to bear it until then. 
---
Yeah same! I love trying different perks rather than just sticking to the exact same perks. Gets pretty boring pretty quickly 
---
That's still shit design, you get no indication how many totems are left or if noed is active.
---
You shouldn't be basing your success on pure guesswork.
---
Jus bustin chops bro
---
But they came in the same Chapter!
---
Emergency kit is actually not that bad 
---
I don't think so. I would call you tryhard, nothing else xD
---
I guess I have a different view of the toxicity meaning
---
I actually forgot that leaving made your points zero so im just dumb. So yeah just add a bonus to survivors if a teammate leaves. Im good with that.
---
This would make him literally useless as a killer
---
That‚Äôs depending on the killer though, someone like clown or nurse or billy or Face could quite easily turn that around 
---
Tinker Toy

Survivors uncontrollably giggle when within a 5/10/15 meter radius

The killer vaults through windows 30/40/50%

Faster, after vaulting you get a 2% speed boost for 1/2/3s
---
sure i know it does but dont run it for 15% bonus bp or whatever the hell it is they run it to protect the real HEX TOTEM PERKS that actually do something lol
---
Ooooh okay, damn haha. Yeah if only. Oh well.

For the team

That's just the wraith
---
Poop myself, Piss Myself

&gt;Lol I love this, it's the equivalent of *"bawk bawk, you a chicken!?"*. Nah I just have less fun against ~~Discord boosts.~~ good survivors
---
I play on PS4 and swf is beyond broken I experience the same queues as you.  It got to the point that I only sk queue or play killer now 
---
Pretty much the same as mine, but I run enduring instead of sloppy.
---
Me too, and I am the same way now. It‚Äôs pretty much impossible for me to feel scared watching anything now. The only time I‚Äôll cringe if it‚Äôs something that makes me squeamish in real life like you said, such as stuff involving eyes lol. 
---
I don‚Äôt get scared at this game at all, because I don‚Äôt get that feeling knowing I‚Äôm against a human opponent on the other end. I do get really scared in other horror games though like Resident Evil. 
---
Real high effort high quality meme here boys.
---
Is this sarcasm? 
---
So did the teens.
---
*you mean two
---
why didn't you just wait for the timer to go down to 6 seconds?
---
I don't know that it's based on mortality as much as it seems based on choosing someone whose disappearance will not be questioned.  For the dead characters (like Tapp, Bill) that's fairly straightforward, while the film characters (Laurie, Quentin) are a little more generic in terms of their emergence in the entity's realm.  But  if we look at the bulk of the BHVR created survivors as examples:
---
\*Dwight, Meg, Claudette, Jake, Kate all went missing in the woods.
---
\*Nea &amp; Jeff both went missing while going to abandoned buildings.
---
\*David was a drunk with few friends who went missing.
---
\*Ace was a scammer with big debts who went missing.
---
\*Feng had no connections - no family, no friends and routinely disappeared.
---
\*Adam I would argue is dead, like Tapp &amp; Bill.  His story is about landing on a window pane during a train crash and letting a door hit him to save another passenger's life.  But even if he is somehow not dead, he is presumed dead from the train crash.
---
Everybody the entity has chosen is either dead or presumed dead.  Most of them, aside from Kate, did not have many admirers or friends.  In a super creepy true crime sort of way - these are unsolved murder/disappearance cases.  And rather than actually having been murdered in the woods as the media or reality television would presume - they've been taken to another dimension.
---
Seeing a real one....why do the survivors need to mess with it for the better part of a minute? Couldn't you just kick it and stomp on it?
---
Or are they actually doing a ritual type thing to cleanse it? 
---
pokemon != furry
---
To trick the killer into thinking it's a freshly made pizza, so that they will chase Dwight for it.
---
Ripping on a killer for "camping" with no gens left is entitlement at its finest man.  There is no other objective to defend at that point other than the hooked survivor.  Like where would you like him to go?
---
I see you üëÄ good call
---
Oh man, that game and the very first Silent Hill... masterpieces in scare! That‚Äôs why Spirit bead spirit with absolutely no noise and coming to yank me off a generator is so freaking scary **AND I LOVE IT**
---
Only when I first got this game, the hag scared me because I didn‚Äôt know about the traps. 
---
Am I not evading correctly? No, it's the killer who is wrong.
---
Some unexpected hag traps still make me jump
---
shit, you got to be kidding me. Have you seen Ace's perks?!?!?!
---
lol how did i not see this, so you say i should only be able to run 1 hex and that TOTH is good cuz it gives notifications of people working on totems...okay so if i am only running TOTH why the hell would i care about ppl destroying the dry totems? lmao the only time that would be something i care about is if i have other hex totems hence the REAL reason TOTH is a hex perk. nobody is going to care enough about 15% bp in one category and getting notifs of someone destroying dry totems that have no chance of turning into NOED later since in your dream land theory only 1 hex can be played......smdh
---
As I‚Äôm not currently under the influence of any hexes I‚Äôll let this one pass for now, but you better believe I marked it‚Äôs location!
---
Rank 1 NOED brave gameplay
---
What are you complaining about? What else perks would you use for endgame

Should have put Claudette in place to the right

Nah, this totally isn't an overused meme format beating the dead horse that is 'freddy rework'.
---
I can tell you put alot of thought into this meme, I wouldn't be sarcastic with you.
---
I'm never sure how I feel about Alex Jones but he does have some great lines lol
---
I just have take issue with a brag post about any build that contains that crutch man.  It'd be like a decisive user posting their escape build.  Not bragworthy man.

Thanks for the encouragement bro I'm writing you into my will

Yes, and the ones that body block or do the thing with the ear noise still surprise me 
---
WITH A BIG BLACK COCK
---
Pharmacy gels very well with plunders and ace in the hole
---
Not OP but I can still give information. NOED is an acronym for a killer perk called No One Escapes Death which only activates once all generators are complete. This allows the killer to one hit down any survivor regardless of their health along with making the killer slightly more faster.
---
NOED is a hex perk that will activate on one of the dull totems in the map. If all five are destroyed then NOED cannot activate. This is why the meme of "just do totems" exist.
---
If you have any other questions I will be more than happy to explain more.
---
I am not bragging
---
I use decisive,  but I believe the rework will be very good for the game as well as the community.

**Pharmacy** \- Give it an increased medkit efficiency usage and a bonus speed to healing others (small bonus and to non-Medkit heals) and it'll be a good perk that now better fits Quentin's theme of protecting and taking care of his teammates.
---
**Vigil** \- I honestly don't know for this one. I don't run Vigil a lot, despite being a Quentin Main. Maybe it could show you when your fellow Survivors are inflicted by a status effect/how long they have to recover from said status effect? Or maybe it could give your fellow Survivors an additional boost to other stuff; like Recovery Speed or something else? Maybe if you took a Protection Hit for a fellow Survivor it could apply a Borrowed Time effect to you (that'd be hard to code and probably too powerful AND not in keeping with the perk as it is right now, but it'd be perfect for Quentin given how he helps Nancy at the end of the film)? IDK, help me out here fellow Quentin Mains. :p
---
**Wake Up** \- Make the visibility of Gates infinite for all tiers, give the bonus to opening a Gate and visibility to Survivors who are within 5/10/15 meters of you, and reveal the aura of an opened gate's handle to all other Survivors. Still very niche, but it's now a lot more helpful and powerful (which all niche perks should be) and it benefits your team more, which is in keeping with Quentin's supposed theme.
---
I don‚Äôt know the point of dodging those people anyway, Yeah they might be good, but I‚Äôve seen some pretty bad legacy survivors
---
If you‚Äôre having less fun against swf than solos, you should get good so it doesn‚Äôt matter what you play against
---
Yes, saying that a specific killer needs the perk is also nonsense, but it's the only argument they can make that cannot also be made by survivors defending DS. 
---
Lol bring on your downvotes tunneling baby pieces of shit.  You can win with Pig without resorting to the babydick tactics.
---
But did you get your pizza in under 20 mins? 
---
It alerts you the moment you touch any totem that Thrill exists or not.  At that point if you were to find the hex if you spam the cleanse button it repeatedly explodes like someone failing a gen every second.
---
the premonition noise scares me sometimes if that makes you feel better
---
Lmao you must be new to puberty jizz can‚Äôt get ‚Äústale‚Äù when wet, nice guess though beta boy.
---
I'm a Dwight, usually, but not stereotypical Dwight-in-a-locker or red shirt Dwight, I am refined Halloween event 1900's Dwight that doesn't use lockers (purposefully) and can be counted on to trade my life for yours if you're on the hook in the end game, unless noed is present, then, well, there's always other matches. 
---
I prefer one Nea on the team who, if she wasn't already mysteriously crouched behind the hook when I got hooked, will run across the map leaping hurdles like a well nourished gazelle to save me, one Adam to Garner the attention of the killer early on and be the distraction so we can get to mid game, and one David who will be at every generator I get to before I get there and be half way through repairs, furthermore if I miss a skill check, he'll commit to finishing the generator with me and still be there to help when I get caught
---
I've marked your words and have come to see if they spoke true!
---
What if the actual delivery are the friendships we make along the way. D:
---
Just a meme man chill.
---
Yes, you can slug a survivor to get around it i guess.
---
Please do tell more about this ‚Äúdevious strategy‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt like being camped because, just like you, I‚Äôm a person trying to play a game. Even if get caught and hooked, when you camp, you are denying me the opportunity to continue to play or even give me a chance to make it worth my time. Even chase points from being tunneled is better than literally nothing. It‚Äôs just frustrating. Especially when wait times for lobbies and getting lobby dodged make it even bigger waste of time. 
---
Yeah! you are right, but the problem is that survivors are so dumb.
---
I got camped in a game and there was 3 survivors waiting for an opportunity to save me, what waste of time.
---
You didn't answer my question, what skill has to do with the amount of fun you have versus third-party voice apps. I don't see the relationship. 
---
Noed
---
indeed, they are terrible.  The only one worth running is "Ace in the Hole" BUT only if you are running plunderer instinct.  By itself, its worthless...poor Ace :( 
---
I clean all those that it is in a good spot and memorize where are the ones in bad spots.
---
I‚Äôm Meg and I just have to argue a bit - the last few Jeff‚Äôs May have been Jake mains - leading the killer to me and doing almost nothing most of the time (in my games)
---
I love to see a David, maybe it‚Äôs the muscles but I feel he‚Äôs a protector. 
---
I also like to see Nea‚Äôs and Kate‚Äôs. 
---
People get mad at camping because it prevents them from playing the game.
---
Imagine you want to play a game of DbD, you might even bring a good item or offerings, but because the Killer doesn't really want to play the game it's all wasted. Even people who genrush and Escape aren't happy because they get no Boldness and no Altruism AND all they did was hold down a button repeatedly and run out a door.
---
Camping makes a game dull for everyone in said game, including th
---
&gt;Insert Claudette cleansing a totem when the killer doesn't have ruin
---
thank you. i'v had really hard time enjoying life for a few days, you just made me laugh for the first time. i hope you have an amazing week.
---
Because you're trash
---
I'm a baby Claudette that tries to do gens while I want to main Nea as she is Bae. I can't really say about other survivors.
---
As a killer though I find Laurie annoying, Bills to be helpful to their team members and Megs to be everywhere. Not many Tapps or Adams
---
What is the image from?
---
Pharmacy is kinda underrated tbh.
---
Feng with bad ping
---
Megs frequently can be amazing for me.  They can bring a really great competitive energy to a match - "We're gonna fuck that Killer up!  Sideways!".
---
I think that it's still an easy strat to counter, just use teamwork to rescue the person from the hook, like fixing generators. And I don't need an excuse to camp other than it allows me to win games, unless it's entirely broken. It's a competitive environment. 
---
It's from the short film 'So You Want to Be a Pirate!' 
---
Reminds me of Deltarune lol
---
Ok... There already is a 'cool down' for their vaulting since they have to be in frenzy to do so. Also mending Deep Wounds doesn't trigger Nurse's Calling. 
---
I'd like to have some advice on this game. Sending my discord profile on pm to you, wanna chat about the game? My English might get a bit strange bc I speak portuguese natively
---
Really situational. Let's say you've cleansed 3 totems and know where a 4th is but don't know if the 5th has been cleansed yet. In that situation it may be better to check back on it and see if it is lit after all gens are done, but you run the risk that it is the final one and can't cleanse it in time to stop people from being affected by it.

Toss "being a little bitch over memes" onto the pile of problems I'd *love* to have.

Does open handed stack? So if 4 people were running it it would be 32 meters
---
Not even gonna wake him up, huh? Hahah
---
As you approach it and crouch you see words overlay across your vision saying ‚ÄúThrill of the hunt‚Äù and then you hear a whooshing sound 
---
Yep, had the same thing. Took time to video capture the offending players and then disconnected and reported.
---
Got a very nice message from one of the other two solo survivors in the game saying how sorry he was that people like that ruined the game for everyone else.
---
Yes.
---
Meh, I would still eat it.
---
Hand on point
---
It haunts my dreams
---
Hauntingly beautiful. I love this style! I‚Äôm crocheting a spirit right now, so I love seeing love for her! 
---
You're a self-admitted camper. You're trash. Probably a rank 15. That trash strategy won't work for long kid.
---
I don't get it. It's just a normal survivor build?
---
well TOTH would have to be completely reworked or else it would be a pointless perk
---
Only Adam, Bill and Tapp were dying/dead
---
Totally!! That‚Äôs how I love to play. I recently have had some great games where I have really changed the game or felt like I made a difference to taking hits and having the killer chase me while 3 gens get done. It‚Äôs a great feeling!
---
I'm a Nurse main. Here are my stereotypes so far.
---
* Claudettes - can be anything from toxic af tryhards who farm their teammates to completely normal and silent in end game chat and normal. Everyone at the high end or low end of play seems to run Claudette. There is very little in between. Will have DS if there is no Laurie and will tbag relentlessly at exit gate or hatch. The most toxic people run Claudette
---
* Megs - almost as toxic as Claudette. Guaranteed to be a little toxic no matter what tho with flashlight spam and tbagging. Runs everywhere, always. Tries to out run the nurse. Sometimes has DS but will DC immediately after getting caught again.
---
* Dwights - meme builds or legit good players. Former will spam flashlight if they can, later will be super stealthy do 3 gens, get every unhook, and still be left to die after the gates are open.
---
* Jakes - pretty cool actually. Rarely toxic. Likes the outfits. Loops effectively.
---
* Laurie - guaranteed DS, even if not the obsession. First one found with OOO build and yet still runs directly into the killer. Hides and contributes nothing after the first person dies. DCs very often at the slightest inconvenience. Always hits the DS skill check.
---
* Davids - guaranteed Dead Hard. Toxic af. Does everything in their power to annoy the killer so they get chased, only gets 1000 in boldness. Tbags when they realize they're caught. Never gets to use their fancy flashlight. Does no gens. Gives up on 2nd hook a lot.
---
* Nea - for some reason either super chill or pretty toxic. Depends on the outfit. Guaranteed to run balanced landing and urban evasion. Expect salty end game chat at you or other survivors.
---
* Fengs - also always running balanced landing. I don't know why. Flashlight spam is their go to, even if they never get to use it. Expect salty end game chat.
---
* Aces - cool dudes generally. Crouch everywhere with urban evasion. Generally there to farm chests.
---
* Bills - see David but better skilled. 50/50 chance to run unbreakable but never gets to use it. Sometimes salty in end game chat, but not always. Plays the game seriously and is a good team player. Knows to save DS for when they need to make a play.
---
* Tapps - actually pretty cool. Tries to be sneaky but gets caught a lot. Very rarely toxic.
---
* Quintens - for some reason legit really love their quinten character. Plays the game pretty seriously and generally cool in end game chat.
---
* Adams - pebble memes. Doesn't know how to use it and gets caught every time. Kinda toxic but not often.
---
* Jeffs - not toxic really. Hate BBQ with a vengeance. Competent on how to play survivor. Runs everywhere.
---
Thank you
---
No, they do it by neglecting their side objectives you jackass lmao. You survivors can't handle that when there are 3 more of you? Boohoo

I‚Äôm learning this, tell me more since you seem to know so much about crusty cum mouths.
---
**unzips**
---
IMAGINE GETTING CALLED TRYHARD BY A KILLER WITH A RED MORI, RUIN AND NOED WHO BASICALLY CHILLED AROUND THE HOOK
---
We about to have a crusade in the Fog ya'll.
---
Would you also say a survivor is justified in leaving a game when up against an OP killer add-on or mori, because it is less fun to play against?
---
I understand the killer goes in at a disadvantage (unless they are using something OP) against full SWF squads. However, the killer also does have the advantage against solos. Wouldn‚Äôt taking on all comers just make things balanced? 
---
So it's a priest/religious killer! I'm excited!
---
Still not 100% sure what the Mali flag had to do with this but still hyped.
---
Camping sucks. 
---
I only allow it for the end game. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just wasting my time. I‚Äôm not playing the game and I‚Äôm not getting any bloodpoints. 
---
I‚Äôd rather disconnect honestly, unless I‚Äôm playing swf and then I‚Äôll just waste your time while you watch me on a hook.
---
As a killer, it greatly inhibits your ability to get maximum bloodpoints.
---
They need to post this stuff on their social media. The forums suck for finding new information because it's poorly organized and things get buried easily. I found this out by reading this message, and went to the forum to read more and honestly, I can't find this post anywhere. There's nothing new in "News" since the 22nd. Every thursday I ping them on twitter and ask for an update on what's going out and there's nothing. They removed the Livestream from their schedule a couple of hours ago and didn't post about it anywhere.
---
They really have gone from be one of the best developers as far as communication goes, to being totally confusing. I used to look forward to the weekly dev streams, even if they were not the most information filled, because it gave a face to the company. Now it just seems disorganized and messy.
---
Hyped!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Although I don't care about skin colours, having survivors of other ethnicities isn't a bad thing so I wouldn't mind it.
---
If you have 3x as many people, you can handle totems. If not, you need to improve your time management. I only solo as survivor and rarely run into a NOED that activates at high ranks and usually do 2-3 totems on average myself. NOED is going to stay how it is and if survivors don't learn how to do a pretty easy secondary objective that can totally counter it *or* stay hidden until going out the door, the problem is on them and their skill. 
---
Eu posso ajudar
---
2 weeks is plenty of time for a competent dev team to fix bugs. It's clear their QA is weak at best and they're beyond slow to react to known issues  
---
I feel like it'd need to be for those who complete/win a certain number of games in rank 1.  People will just reach rank 1, get the reward, then derank just like they do now.
---
A N G E R Y    O I N K
---
*Drools* Burn victim. So hyped
---
Yes, you are right. Do you have more insight on strategies? 
---
Why do you feel the need to insult me over my comment? It brings nothing to the argument and makes you look like a douche.
---
The only reason for clensing totems is Noed, besides that it's not an objective. Having to assume that every game every killer has noed because there is no indicator for the survivors is bad design.
---
Everybody having to run around for 5 minutes looking for every single totem spawn if you're not in swf since there is no totem counter is bad design too.
---
Bzzzz
---
Me at 3 am on the kitchen to get some food.

Red Paint Brush + Monitor and Abuse for a basically 0 meter tr. If you add Z Block, you also have only a 3 sec transition phase, often giving you a free hit. As long as you are not in a chase, dreamworld suddenly becomes a scary place to be in, since it is basically a Mirror Myers, except the vision is worse for the survivors and Freddy moves at 110% movement speed (red paint brush reduces the speed by 5%) instead of myers 105%, as well as being able to get bloodlust. It is a fun, if a bit gimmicky, build
---
Don't forget the Coxcombed Clapper + The Ghost Wraith. Plenty of spooky gen grabs with that setup.
---
Mali is the internal name for the chapter. Same for haiti chapter for spirit, or kenya chapter for legion. You can see them in your folder under D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Dead by Daylight\DeadByDaylight\Content\UI\Icons\CharPortraits for example. 
---
I want them to fix it cuz I didn't mastered the technique of playing with one hand

---
Upvote because respect to nurse mains. 
---
&gt; Would you also say a survivor is justified in leaving a game when up against an OP killer add-on or mori, because it is less fun to play against?
---
No because that's a false equivalency, leaving a lobby and leaving a match in progress. 
---
&gt;owever, the killer also does have the advantage against solos. 
---
I don't agree with you that players are somehow handicapped by loading into the solo queue without voice apps. Agree to disagree I guess.
---
But if the DL obsession isn't the DS obsession then the obsession will transfer to the DS player after a successful hit.
---
The Hierophant
---
Some objects have what is labeled as 'deadzones' where instead of blinking inside of an object it will just teleport you right back to where you were starting the blink from (at least as far as I know). These deadzones spread throughout the entire hitbox of whatever you're blinking through. If it's a short blink, you might have to charge it to max or simply go a bit farther from the car with a big one. Either that, or blink around it and try to mindgame the survivor into running into you.   
---
Keep in mind, it's all about being as precise as possible and confusing the survivor with unpredictable blinks close to the pallet to get free hits  
---
And those cars have pretty odd hitboxes and deadzones if you've seen huntresses try to hit you over the same cars.
---
\*Flashlight intensifies\*
---
When your English is so bad we can barely understand what you mean. 
---
Depends, what killer(s) do you use? 
---
Itd only count rank one if you're rank 1 at the end of the season, so the only way to preserve rank 1 would be just to not play, but that could also be prevented by adding a certain time period where if someone doesn't play for long enough their rank starts to go down at a slow rate, fast enough to where people who get to rank 1 almost at the beginning of the season and stop playing won't get the reward, but slow enough to where people can't abuse it to derank and go against easier people

I love the crying Markiplier.

Who knows. They're kind of a mess these days. There's some schedule buried in the forums but it's worthless because they've been updating it the day-of and changing things that were supposed to happen. I'm pretty sure they remove the live stream today around 11am and didn't post about it.

Edit: There is apparently a post from today, somewhere, that says they're not doing live streams as often anymore, but I can't find it anywhere because their forum is a pain to navigate.

I think killer was a burn victim, took light a little too literally

I played on console for my first 300 hours of the game. I reckon that Nurse is pretty bad on console, moving from console to pc made me realise the immense difference.

Lol read that as fleshlight

If this killer's power is to create dense areas of fog, I'm gonna be so hyped. I'm always down for another stealth killer.

Off topic but last night I was doing a Nea daily. A really great Meg had been getting gens and saves. We got gate opened and I was hooked, Meg made the save and ended up hooked. The rest of us healed then saved her. All four of us escaped. After in chat killer, a Trapper, was salty and thought we were on Discord. Just 4 randos doing good. 
---
fog machine 
---
I have no idea what to think it is.. I'll just stick with Egypt cos idk
---
This is amazing, and gives me the vibe that this is what she was like in that second before she made a revenge pact with The Entity.
---
Thurifer. 
---
Honestly, I never thought it was that OP of a perk. Even playing as a killer. The only time is when the hatch is open or the gate. When you down the obsession before either of those open up, they use it and then they are done with it. Even when they use it, it isn‚Äôt hard to catch them to down them again.
---
it is clearly a dragon priest from skyrim
---
As an Ace main I can concur that his teachables are weak. Open handed is good for bond and other aura reading perks like kindred. Up the ante is only good with luck offerings but even then it‚Äôs still poo poo. Ace in the hole is a great farming perk that pairs well with plunders instinct and pharmacy.
---
The real killer is this comment
---
True for that one, too! But it‚Äôs getting easier and easier for me to see him all wavy see through as he comes towards me. 
---
Because the Bee is a respectable guy like that. He‚Äôs just chill about life. Survivors doing gens? Well, he‚Äôll give you a couple. Let you have your fun. 
---
Well, that game was screwed.
---
Oh, it's heavily a nerf. Survivors no longer get to whip out D Strike whenever they please. If the 60 seconds after being unhooked is up, or the killer doesn't tunnel at all, it's a dead perk.
---
I agree
---
Enduring main here 
---
Was it ever sober in the first place? 
---
crouch up against it and just keep saying "oh.. unnhh... hm.. ow... hmm.. unhh"
---
You can't juggle anyway. The DS skillcheck is during the pickup animation.
---
We already have one of those, I think he will utilize the smoke for either movement or stealth, maybe both considering the hand seems to be coming out of the smoke.

My question exactly

well well..."demise of the Faithful" is the new chapter.   Looks like you were wrong buddy in them NEVER making a religious character.  Must of been another FAKE statement
---
Yee. Now I can make church puns when I play as the new killer.
---
Lol all you're getting Monday is a dev stream
---
Terror radius replaced by a thick mist effect that's only visible to survivors within the radius, provides debuffs to survivors within the radius (alterable by add-ons), base blindness, and the smoke expands as generators get finished (light won't help tagline) so the killer morphs from a small radius stealth killer to a near global debuff in the late game. Ultra rare add-on that applies the exhaustion effect to survivors within the radius. 
---
Oh yeah. Sorry, I just woke up.
---
Blinding Strike:  The Faithful Strikes his thurible (thank you, Google), sending out a cone of ashes that temporarily blind survivors.  The blind will be similar to that of a flashlight or cracker blind.
---
A little louder for the thirsty fangirls in the back. 
---
So it's a priest/preacher killer! I'm excited!
---
The incense thing is called a thurible or a censer; the only killer I can think of it would be related to is Hellraiser. They said that the killer would be old, and Hellraiser is old as hell (ha), but he's also relevant to religion by his association to hell. However, homeboy hellraiser didn't carry a thurible. Although, I saw some pics of things called 'cleaners' from "Hellraiser: Judgement" that carried thuribles to cleanse the dead.
---
I like that suggestion.
---
I feel terrible for laughing at this
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/woosh/
---
&gt; Lithe should be purple
---
I would but its so buggy with its procing. 
---
That's one burnt survivor.
---
Like some priest who use to burn people alive say during the Inquisition, which would play into his old age. That would be his tormented background 
---
For every clip like this, there are a dozen of a killer missing a clear window hit, followed by a teabag and flashlight blind. Dry your eyes, mate. 
---
That ain't it, chief
---
I thought in Monitor and Abuse, but right there, in theory, starts a chase. Maybe it's a bug.
---
If the killer is a priest or a nun, then congrats, you got me. If not, I'd still be right (Read the top comment).
---
Like jump out and yell 'Boo!" Scare you or "sir your card has been declined" while you're in front of a long line of inpatient customers scary?
---
Imagine if the killer's power is like Singed from LoL. Leaving a trail of long-lasting smoke that impairs survivors. 
---
Where is this teaser from? I don't remember this mist in the first teaser.
---
Matchmaking you're drunk go home!
---
And yet you over here browsing r/dbdgonewild üòÇ 
---
Maybe a killer who can go back in time? Like tracer or somerhing
---
Hitboxes are the #1 reason I'll be dumping this game.
---
ü§ûsilent hill or Eldritch inspired ü§û
---
Same reason I was insulted by everyone saying I'm wrong and downvoted. There are 5 totems that can be cleansed st any point and 4 survivors. There's really no excuse as to why survivors can't find time. The only problem is some totems are well hidden. I've gotten 4 and not been able to find the last one which sucked but overall it isn't an issue for me or any of my friends I used to playwith (that they brought up anyways). 
---
I had a SWF group all with DS except one and multiple dead hards and flashlights who utilized body blocking and had the audacity to bring up NOED after in angry messages after escaping via a crutch perk 3 times and body blocking (the most rage inducing shit on killer or survivor side for me if they do it right) and it's just garbage to me. 
---
The perk is active for at best 2-3 minutes *if* all totems aren't done. It's a full perk slot that doesn't activate until the end if at all. The killer is handicapped by running it if all totems are cleansed (99% of the time very doable) or if they kill all before all gens completed or if there's a hatch escape. If anything, devour hope is more fucked. 
---
Maybe the killer can drop fog bombs. The killer can see through the fog but the vision for survivors are extremely limited within the fog. This means the killer can strategically drop large amounts of fog whilst the survivor will need to avoid or risk going through it. 
---
Made with 100% pain and suffering now with *tears of despair* üôÇüëç
---
From the bhvr Twitter, it should be a stickied post
---
Hello jthorn32, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
at the risk of being downvoted. 
---
do you guys think that noed would be nerfed if they removed either the instant down and buffed the haste from 4/6/8 to 8/10/12 or vice versa and got ride of the haste and just kept the exposed ? or better yet what about they treat it like haunted grounds where you have a timer. pls dont hurt me.
---
Beast of Prey would be especially nice. Here's another thing--the bonus bloodpoints should be awarded post trial. This should also apply to Hex: Thrill of the Hunt, Distressing, etc. 
---
Except killers can‚Äôt. Which is exactly why turdnuggets like this do what they do. 
---
Huddah huddah huh.
---
Can't say for certain, but I have heard that depending on what platform your playing on (ps4, xbox, pc) that queue times can vary. As a PC player, I've never had trouble finding queues in a swf with my buddies despite pretty large rank disparity (a buddy of mine just got this game yesterday, and we were playing games, me at rank 1 and him at rank 20). I've heard that ps4 has the worst queue times due to the fact that the community isn't as active, but I cannot confirm that. 
---
lol...you are hopeless

A curse maybe? Something magical most likely.

I THINK THOSE TWO IDIOTS GOT INSPIRED FROM DEMI'S VIDEO "CORNER CREEPERS" GO WATCH IT IT'S FUCKING RIDICULUS
---
We exist! We're out there! We get a lot of hate but also a lot of praise. Also lots of lobby dodging.
---
Hey, at least we get recognized, right? ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Here is my feedback:
---
-Try using better musics, the music you used became really repetitive
---
-add some sound effects that go with whats happening and try to find new ones(please don't use any ochidoo sound effects)
---
-jukes are fine but try to find better moments in your games, its better to record 300 hours of gameplay for a 3 minute video then to record 1 hour of gameplay for a 3 minute video, if you get what I mean
---
-The zooms ins also need a better focus on when you should use it, try to use it in more moments that we might not notice or should notice
---
Anyways here if my feedback, and don't give up because of my feedback! practice makes perfect soo keep up
---
No dude, look at his legs
---
Not really
---
Perhaps the killer can bee shrouded in mist making it tough to see where he is exactly?
---
heck no.
---
Me too! I'm excited about this DLC, don't let me down BHVR!

Haha oh boy that must be so funny to watch (you in real life playing and getting jump scared)

This is my first proper edited video so I was mostly just testing some things. Thank you for the advice though!! 
---
Oh man that has happened to me if I play a survivor I haven‚Äôt played in a while and I have that perk on. The noise is so unexpected!
---
Same name as my car! :) 
---
Looks scary! Might be kinda easy to avoid her though since you can see her from pretty far away 
---
I strongly doubt it was overly immersed, that Claudette without a doubt knew exactly what she was doing and was probably just trying to ruin the streak.
---
This OP is a witch.  Commence burning! 
---
Something interesting: the censer is clearly being held in the right hand. Assume that he doesn't switch stances like the doctor, this implies that the censer *is* his primary weapon. It would be interesting if he swings it like a flail, maybe giving increased basic attack range or something similar.
---
[Template for others who think everything is worthless](https://i.imgur.com/Mp5CAhu.png)
---
The styles of the killer have been filling a lot of good styles of horror with every new chapter.  The more _hauntingly beautiful, nobel/regal, alluring ghost woman_ femme trope is one of the other tropes that be cool to explore for a chapter. 
---
The new killer is trying to get you to come ta Jesus, but you keep denying it.  Get with the program.  You gotta get saved if you want to get out! 
---
Survivors were cleansing dulls before hex perks were a thing, in the short time between the totem update and hag release. Optional secondary objectives that offer BP gains will always draw survivors into wasting time. 
---
I still cleanse haunted grounds knowing what it is for those sweet BP gains, because if I don't someone else will.
---
Is this legit?
---
Is that an extra dimensional microphone?  Is this man about to testify-uh?! 
---
Being able to 360 is still a thing but realize better killers won‚Äôt fall for that crap. Only high rank killers would fall for that on the regular. 360 jukes only work if the killer messes it up, not if the survivor does it properly.
---
If he is true evil then why doesn't he kill the kids or infants he comes across in the movies? I know in the Halloween (2018) he killed a kid but that kid was holding a weapon.
---
 I think he has a small understanding of relationships but only for the youth.
---
Imo Freddy is more evil to me. The dude preys on children.
---
We were cleansing dulls before hex totems were added. Free BP is free BP.

They stare at the survivors campfire, excluded and breathing at them from 20 feet away.

How do you get mummy from burn wounds and a censer? 
---
Here we go with this again
---
Darkest Dungeon crossover when?
---
More likely the survivor or some irate townsfolk got sick of his shit and shoved him into his witch-burning fire.  As in, S/HE was burning someone at the stake and got shoved in instead. 
---
Whatever it is the art looks fantastic.   
---
That's pretty much why I never use cakes or streamers as a survivor. You either get found quickly, or the loading screen kills you instead.
---
I did until I realized I was wasting a perk slot constantly missing the damn thing.
---
Omfg, if they let me flashlight blind those effing claudette, I'd be sooooo happy. 
---
Except killers totally can.
---
Of course it's a Claudette, lol.
---
Gratis kaffe!
---
I'm a Claudette personally,
---
I tend to clamp down on gens unless a nearby teammate needs me to intercept a killer mid-chase (I bring T3 empathy). 
---
As for teammates I've never played with a toxic Jeff so I'm always happy to see his bearded face :). I also like how most kates I've seen play - Like a less stupid david king imo
---
99% of the lore is speculation 
---
She used to be completely immune to pallet stuns, but they changed it to where if the nurse‚Äôs blink ends within pallet stun range and a survivor drops the pallet, she‚Äôll get stunned and go into fatigue. It‚Äôs still difficult to pull off, especially if the nurse knows that they‚Äôre doing, but it is possible to stun her with pallets now. 
---
ptb is next tuesday, so we'll see him then.
---
The hardest choice is when you want to do that, but then you realize you‚Äôd miss a BBQ and Chili token because you haven‚Äôt hooked them yet..
---
Myers isn't even harder to master than Billy lol. Just weaker. 
---
I only use them rank 4+. Killers are ‚Äúless likely‚Äù to be complete buzz kills. But last reset fucked me. Instead of putting me at 4, it shot me down to 10. 
---

---
Oh shit that's deep.
---
I can hear the IV lobby music in my head now...

That‚Äôll change when I suck his cock
---
That explains the moonwalking exploit. Who but edgy teens would have their entire gameplay defined by abusing bugs?
---
I feel like the only one who doesn't like Noob3. For the longest time I avoided any of his content because of the controversy when he got banned or suspended or something. The way he tried to incite his viewers into doing something and claimed it was completely unreasonable and without explanation--then it turned out he'd hacked for legacy. It was just like every other cheater I've ever heard of denying they did anything wrong. I get that people have been watching his content for a long time but things like that cast doubt over everything someone does in a game for me.
---
That's no mummy,  feminine hands and that chain wrapping the arm.. I'm gonna go with priestess or summat. I was really hoping for Aicha, though. 
---
I think it's a burned witch from Salem, looking at the arm in the tweet. Or a heretic priest/nun. Either way, good stuff.
---
That's not gonna bee a thing anytime soon.
---
Probably a dove. Worst case, a swallow. Another movie had swallows was Monty Python and the Holy Grail. That movie also had witches in it. As we know, witches love honey. Bees make honey - confirmed killer - The Bee. 
---
That‚Äôs an opportunist if I‚Äôve seen one
---
That would be stupid in my opinion 
---
Is english your second language? This is called dindu, this def isnt english.
---
Because a perk like Franklins Demise exists and DS would be useless .
---
PEE PEE
---
ADVENTURES
---
pffffhHahaahAHAH*AHAHAHAA*
---
&gt;sacrificing yourself if the killer isn‚Äôt hooking you and you‚Äôre over it
---
Negative. Survivors shouldn't just be able to be like "Welp, I don't like how this match is going, time to boogie on out of here".
---
Vampires or witches? Those who argue it‚Äôs a man arm, there ARE men witches (warlocks)

Because then you could take four perks, and Decisive Strike.

---
In plain sight, so it's weird that the survivors don't just, you know, *run*. 
---
They do it by disconnecting ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è when you know the last survivor knows where the hatch is and the killer is just leaving you there it‚Äôd be nice to have the option to kys from the ground. 
---
Calm down, fam, i was trying to be nice. 
---
Theres no proof that actually happened tho. People just go based off what their teachers tell them or what some big nosed shill tells them.
---
Revenge for them dang firecrackers!
---
Sarcasm aside I‚Äôm of the belief that the killers are hiding in the woods looking at them 
---
It's because he delivers frozen Digornio pizzas so they don't get crushed like that.
---
I‚Äôm sorry for asking but I have no idea what P3 means. Could someone explain it to me 
---
That's idea that sounds cool when you think off it first, but then you realise that it's extremely stupid in current realia of the game.
---
That's why DC-ing to give someone else the hatch, as well as DC-ing in general, needs to have stricter punishments. Again, survivors shouldn't have the ability to just completely undermine a decision the killer made and leave the match if they don't like how it's going.
---
Well it didnt happen so...

He will just get hardware banned over and over and over.

WHY DO I GET THE FEELING THAT THE NEW DWIGHT SKIN WILL BE AN ASSHOLE FLAG? JUST PLAYED AGAINST ANOTHER WHO CHANGED INTO HIS WITH AN EQUIPPED FLASHLIGHT A SECOND BEFORE MATCH STARTED (WHICH I WOULD HAVE DODGED THE HECK OUTTA USUALLY BC FLASHLIGHT AGAINST HAG TOO OP PLS NERF) AND WOW YOURE SO GOOD WITH YOUR CLICKIECLICKE OH MY GOD PLEASE SHOVE THAT PIZZA BAG UP YOUR BUTT
---
Yeah, probably.
---
There is a stream on Monday on which they want to talk about the dlc
---
Q1: The game is supposed to get optimized around early spring so it might help.
---
Q2: The placement of traps depends on the survivors, if they are bad and don't use loops they are usually useless. You can just put them right after or before a palet in plain sight that they will see and run to. Not UNDER the palet, it's a bad habit that you shouldn't take, better players can take advantage of it as if the trap is under the palet, they can throw down the palet and then vault, and the trap would be useless since it would be under the downed palet. Against better players, the window at the shack is always a good idea since there's always grass there. On the cow tree in the grass on Coldwind farm. And more generally in the grass around loops and windows and not directly next to the palet where they will expect a trap. Anyway, it comes with experience where people go the most, which trap is more useful and which one is useless. Also, putting a trap even in plain sight just to cancel a loop can be a good idea, they will see it but they won't be able to go there.
---
Q3: Practice again, the first couple of seconds when you use the chainsaw you have a LOT maneuverability which can make you fail the chainsaws. After that, there's not much to say, on some maps you can't really make good sprints, but there are usually some corridors allowing you to go from one side to the other, use them.
---
Q4: A lot of the loops in the game have no mindgame for the killers, the one where the survivors can see the killer while looping. These cannot be mindgamed (unless they are really short loops or you're using your bloodlust which is counter productive), and you shouldn't try to go back to mindgame. Just eat the palet and move to another palet, you can test the skill of the survivor though at first, some don't watch behind them so you can turn back and catch them. But at some point, every suvivor look behind themselves which makes these loops really strong. So, at the start of the game, test the survivors you're chasing, if they don't watch behind themselves, try to go back on a loop and hit them. If they do watch behind themselves, follow them until they drop the palet and try to lead them where you can mindgame them (unfortunately, on Coldwind farms almost every loop cannot be mindgamed as a killer). One of the best and most used technique is the moonwalking, it has two uses. One is on loops where they can't see you, so they look behind themselves to see your rain stain on the ground. If you moonwalk when they are about to see you rain stain, well they won't see it and think that you went back around, so they'll stop and go back too and you can hit them. The other use is on loops where they can see you, if you turn suddenly and moonwalk, they might think you're going to turn and go back, so they'll get confused and stop fort a couple of seconds. Allowing you to get to them faster. But don't over use the moonwalking as it can sometimes lose you more time, it's a matter of practice of when to use it.
---
Try to look for OhTofu's tutorials on youtube, they can help you. You can also try to watch some good killers that will answer your questions while showing you examples while they are playing. OhTofu has a lot of viewers usually but answers most of the time, TydeTyme is also pretty good but tryhard usually (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) and he'll answers your questions, he also has a lot of knowledge on the game. Giddawid is a community manager who streams survivors and killers games, he's a very positive streamer and will probably give you a lot of advice for sure. 
---
I guess we're snowflakes for being angry about people doing something that makes you an asshole aye
---
Devour Hope should lose three tokens upon cleansing instead of the entire effect. It's a pretty good anti-camping perk that more people would use if the risk was mitigated a bit. 
---
I'm glad the name caught on!
---
Fragile masculinity? In 2019? Can't relate. üíÖ
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs this. The whole time of darkness/light to follow quote seems a bit cliche for it only be to a reference to a religious killer. I think it‚Äôs referring to a gameplay mechanic as well, such as blinding survivors. Or could just be referring to something happening when generators get lit, who knows.
---
Of course, it‚Äôs also possible I‚Äôm just overanalyzing things.
---
Stands for bad manners. I had to ask a roommate what he meant too. Fucking dumb abbreviation to pick.

For those normies who apperantly didnt get it, its a petition to change the name of decisive strike to defensive strike.

"He is bad with the easiest killer in the game" I'm not sure of we're playing the same game, but hillbilly is far from the easiest killer in the game. Not even close 
---
I dont
---
Screw the hand, looks at that pups face!! üòç
---
&gt;unless they "Clown" this one up again
---
I see what you did there fam ;)
---
Well when you DC you lose all your points and typically get reported. I play from both ends and I think when NOED is in play the killer has a total advantage especially when there‚Äôs only 2 survivors left. I get that DS is annoying af but killers have a decent amount of control over a game and if you main enough wiping out the survivors with certain killers can be pretty darn easy. 
---
Thanks
---
That's probably best, yeah. I take my chances and rush through generators, hoping I can power a gate before he finds me, or he chases some one else instead. Then again when I'm downed by NOED, I don't blame anyone but myself since I could have done more to avoid it....
---
If you combine deerstalker with knock out what‚Äôs the point of knock out?
---
Burning Desire
---
Hellfire
---
Eternal Damnation
---
So it‚Äôs extremely unreasonable that a serial killer bent on killing you could and would reach over a small obstacle to hit you? That isn‚Äôt a bad hit box.
---
It all depends how its implemented.

&gt;they exist in the same game and are often brought up to highlight what people perceive as an imbalance in a game
---
The devs don't perceive them to be equal to each other, though. Doesn't matter in the slightest that they're in the same game, either.
---
Those things are mostly used in churches, and with the title of the chapter and caption, it‚Äôs definitely something to do with a church rather than a cult 
---
Now that's hot
---
Pretty bold words for someone in crusading distance
---
He was around during Nurse‚Äôs time. 1940‚Äôs. Unless he is sent back to the real world to get killers and survivors I doubt it.
---
It's impossible huh? Then how am able to get up there as killer?
---
Just because you personally don't know how to do something doesn't mean it's impossible. And no you don't have to dead hard or get hit to get up there.
---
Base nurse still needs mental skill to predict against any decent survivor. Being able to blink where they are now is how you get run around like an idiot all game when you get to a lower rank.
---
This is DBD history
---
You weren't able to because you don't know how. Also once you're down it takes a while to get back up and it cant be done with the killer behind you

Chill, guys. He done delivered his pizza so it's an empty heat pouch! Can a pizza delivery guy get chased by killers in the realm in peace for once without always getting judged for not doing their job? Geez.
---
Legion needs a completely new power. Idk what the devs smoked before deciding having a killer that runs loops faster than a survivor was a good idea, but they probably bought it from a toothless man deep in a swamp. 
---
As an Ace main this is accurate af. Gotta grow the item hoard :)
---
Report to your nearest ~~death maze~~ ~~trial~~ ~~murder garden~~ Entity's Old Fashioned Fun Yard to redeem.
---
No it doesn't. 
---
A) You don't know what killer you will verse. Outside of first week of release it will just be "Welp, I wasn't Nostradamus this time" moment again and again.
---
B) You should not be obliged to have and use certain offering, prohibiting you from using stuff you really want to use. 
---
C) Survivors have way bigger say in final outcome of reagent usage since they put in 4 and each of those are identical in strength to killers

This looks the most interesting out of the four themewise. Let's hope I will be able to say the same about his power.

I don't want a killer's power to be dependent on offerings.

Happy for Ohm and Bryce, been watching their channels for some time.
---
The survi or will most likely be a holy figure and the killer will most likely be a sonic figure. Think thresh from league. That's how it's seeming to me tbh. What ever it is tho I'm excited 
---
Just watched that whole movie series in order. So good!
---
Now I'm getting space marines vibes.
---
they said their "oldest killer to date" are they talking about their age meaning tof an old person because I'm confused how a priest is old, Although I'm not religious so they could have been around since Medieval times.
---
Nice warframe crossover lol 
---
Rank 1 at both (Hag and Freddy), but I play more survivor since I find killer kind of boring. I even comment on how to counter 360ing prior to the hitbox change in my first response.
---
Your response did not address the change, only stated that better killers are better. Maybe it's a console thing? People always talk about lag on there so it's possible the difference is less noticeable. However, on PC, it is night and day. Practically all of my friends list could run for 3-5 gens relying heavily on 360s (even against good killers since you couldn't commit to vault hits as early do to the threat of 360s; now, you will not last long with that tactic even against mediocre killers). As killer, I can just tromp along straight behind them and swing without reacting to their direction--that absolutely was not the case before the change.
---
This is beautiful
---
FUCK
---
Female. 
---
The power of the Entity compels you *wacks survivor with cross*!
---
I think it will be a female because the last two were males. Also fun fact; the noise in the woods that Frank heard was actually Jeff going to the lodge and cracking a cold one!
---
what the fuck did you just say about Pharmacy, you little bitch? I'll have you know that I graduated top of my class in the DBD school on discord, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on the basement chest, and I have over 200 confirmed Emergency Medkits. I am trained in urban evasion and I'm the top pebble thrower in the entire survivor armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another minor injury. I will heal you the fuck out with speed the likes of which has never been seen before by self care users, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to Pharmacy over the internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Quentin mains (about 6 people) and your emergency medkits are being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call "self-care". You're fucking dead, kid. I can heal anywhere, anytime, and I can heal quickly once (almost twice), and that's just with 1 chest (per a game).
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt trust them...
---
So this is why solo sucks so much 
---
His power is fear. Fear and surprise. Two powers. His two powers are fear and surprise and a fanatical dedication to the Entity. Three! Three powers. 
---
Happy cake day!
---
Appreciate it.  
---
Of course, pre-ds nerf of course.
---
Just looks like that texture didnt load properly, so when you hit a survivor and blood splattered the default box texture replaced it.
---
Clown's got the hookah, Bubba has the coke.
---
I'm not blaming you or anything I'm just correcting you where you were wrong.
---
You said something can't be done I'm just letting you know it can be done.
---
Handle it however you want.
---
Surely that's the point though? You're sexually attracted to him because you want him to *kill you*.
---
New survivor perk:
---
-Pray to God    (It does literally nothing except makes you kneel down in prayer, but maybe the killer will spare you)
---
Ok, that makes sense. Weird though, first time it happened to me. Was trying to hold composure since I was streaming, but it was throwing me off.
---
Its easy. Once you hit a good skill check let go of the generator at the same time. The gen will stop without regression. This is on ps4. 
---
Definitely female because the survivor and killer are opposite genders in DLC. The only exception was Freddy Krueger (but that wasn‚Äôt fully in BHVRs control). 
---
Technically legion as it was multi gender, but like I said otherwise it‚Äôs always opposite genders. 
---
Did anyone ever find that Claud's profile?
---
Detective hunch. That all
---
I think Bubba is more quaaludes. Billy got the meth.
---
What lore does that belong to? Or is it its own thing? 
---
I'm not sure but if I had to guess I'd say no
---
Yeah cause we don‚Äôt have enough of them in every other single video game üôÑ
---
Nurse smokes her cigs with Freddy in the bag, although she doesn't know Freddy is there. Poor Freddy.
---
What a legend
---
So NOED is good against genrushing? It slows survs down if they look for totems first, or fucks them over if they rushed gens and get onehit.
---
Seems like such a win-win perk to me, and I'm survivor main
---
I use kindred so it would be nice if I could if it was base then you could see if anyone is going for the hooked survivor or if you should do it yourself. 
---
...darn. 
---
Well almost all the dlc has opposite genders :P
---
Myers and Laurie
---
Clown and Kate
---
Spirit and Adam
---
Doctor and Feng
---
Huntress and David
---
Amanda and Tapp
---
And don‚Äôt all bunch up at the gate or heal in the exit. You‚Äôre just asking for the killer to chase u out
---
So what i get is an ancient cultest, maybe has effects that involve his terror raidius and fog. Who knows his power could be release fog that harms those in it, hell red add one could give them exposed status effect when he activates his fog
---
Yeah, but unofficially. So the community could've made any abbreviation but they picked one that people know for bowl movements lol
---
There are a ton of more creepy Courage things you can pick.
---
In fact you could probably make a spin off game with just Courage characters.
---
Spirit is not male? This is confusing me. Do you mean Legion? Even then two of Legion's skins were male and two female, so I'm not sure how that works.
---
The saddest thing in this story is the fact that someone suffered the hit
---
That's the kind of wacky hijinks I would pay good money for
---
I am infinitely disappointed that the final screen didn‚Äôt show four disconnects. Spirit is freaky enough; Spirit sliding at you in an A pose is horrifying. 
---
Well given that he was originally on a bike the box would actually be almost level if he was leaning forward on a bike. 
---
We're talking about survivors, not killers.
---
I don't know how I got that mixed up.
---
I asked everyone if they saw me in a t pose and they all said no lol. That‚Äôs even more disappointing. I was hoping to scare them all at least. 
---
Yeah, his name is SpongeBob SquarePants
---
You‚Äôre not wrong 
---
But that's why we would see if the change is an acceptable one. Ds should still be viable even if it is weaker
---
The real MVP
---
You know you just said ‚Äúshaking my head my head,‚Äù right?
---
The only reason is because I kept phasing and following everyone and breaking pallets and gems. It was HILARIOUS. When breaking them, there was no animation and the pallets would just...explode. I wish I would‚Äôve clipped it. 
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone would argue that Survivor BP gains are too low. I understand the reason: survivors keep their items and add-ons if they survive and can pick up new items from chests, whereas Killers lose their add-ons after every match. It‚Äôs just that that comes at the expense of perk progression which is arguably more valuable early on. 
---
Ace Main! ;)
---
It's the most beautiful thing whenever I encounter another Ace in a lobby! We swoon over each others beauty, grace and gorgeousness - lots of finger guns and winks involved ;)
---
You can always trust an Ace!
---
Especially the ones in a leopard shirt ;)
---
Ace Mains - Unite! ;)
---
*^(submissive squeak)*
---
Same! They all kept running away from me :( 
---
Clown is higher then pig and myers
---
We have to remember that he actually earned the legacy. It was BHVR's incompetence that stripped it away. I don't see anything wrong with him "hacking" to get something he originally earned back when the fault didn't even lie with him in the first place. Not like legacy even gives him an advantage. 
---
Nope.
---
Sheogorath.
---
After he hooks you, he begins a story that he cannot finish and starts talking about his favorite cheeses.
---
How is JenDaNiece still a fog whisperer when shes the most toxic survivor that plays this game? She's just as bad as ochido
---
Agreed.  I finally made it to rank 1 last August and kept at it until this season.  Mostly because once you get to red you run into the same people a lot and most of them are sandbaggers or just toxic SWF and I don't mean just towards killers either.  Last season, *THREE* times I had an SWF use a key and leave me behind.
---
Might Be Why Spies Got A Buff
---
Glorifying people like him needs to stop
---
Yeah, it's not okay until it's removed from the game.
---
Instabuy!!!
---
Yes. Cahla, Morf, and Jendenise were originals. I‚Äôm sure theres more but those are the ones I know from watching them
---
Wow, I had history test today on which was the question to explain First, Third and Fourth Crusade. What a coincidence xD
---
How is Jen toxic?
---
I would say that (+) means higher rank, so 4-1. 
---
I've seen the one where they make a folk song out of his clips and it busts my gut every time haha
---
I hope this is a joke :l
---
I, for one, am ready for a bit of heretic purging.
---
Time to cleanse the unclean souls.
---
We must protect them from the cardinal sin of living.
---
Egyptians had them too.
---
Jen is FAR from Ochido.  The hate boner for her here is kind of ridic. Yeah she does some things sometimes where I shake my head, but she's not traditionally toxic. She just plays the damn game with her friends and I  had no idea that was toxic.
---
This is the right answer, they said that during a stream!
---
It's because of the teaser before this one
---
My logic exactly. A Nea got downed near the gate so first, I opened it. As I was healing her I got a message saying ‚ÄúHEAL ME PUSSY‚Äù so I bounced. 
---
Probably some hideous overweight old dude or some random white guy
---
I've kept my expectations low ever since the spirit chapter. Was really hoping we'd get a hot Japanese girl (cuz y'know, it'd fit the theme for that chapter) and instead we got ugly ass Adam. Such a random character.
---
I don't see why not.
---
Everybody can catch these (spider-like ) hands.
---
Those Tendrils are rated E for Entity.
---
What if you just waited outside the exits and scared them into staying
---
Aww, this is cute.
---
I think you might be onto something here.
---
Does Monto even stream? I dont know all these names but I recognize many from twitch, so I‚Äôm guessing thats probably a requirement.
---
I really wish a buff for weak killers like doc bing bong boi or trapper
---
I am thinking that it might it is some super ancient supernatural killer like a folktale from ancient Egypt, that would be interesting
---
Congrats!
---
Exactly 
---
It definitely do be like that
---
If you‚Äôre wondering what it means,one of my friends is very funny and cool but he always annoys me with the stuff he knows I hate(in a joking matter).one of theses thing was the trapper song (the Here comes the trapper one)so he sang it and then I was immediately decide to Mori him.it was a KYF match so it wasn‚Äôt bad.thats when I said this.
---
I have, multiple times. Check through my comment history, most of it is giving reasons why Freddy isnt bad.
---
Looks more like part of a low hanging robe. Like a very wide armed robe pulled up to the elbow that hangs open.
---
Downvote me at will but seeing the animation gave me terminal cancer 
---
Pretty much no one they asked for Legion feedback said it was a good idea and they just did it anyway.
---
Hide behind nearest trash can, wait for killer to come by to check on it, then jump on it and rub that thang!
---
The only good Claudette is a sacrificed Claudette.
---
Which were all countered by other people. He is the *worst*.
---
Fuck
---
Off
---
And in the 11th Chapter, the devs created a medieval killer. And it was good.
---
I was low-key hoping to see OchiDO in there as a joke.  
---
Anyway, I'm glad to see my boy HybridPanda get a spot. He's one of the few I actually watch. Many are, uh, hard to stomach.
---
Generator to the left of me hanging out
---
As someone who finds themselves often going up against teams that are 5-10 ranks above him (ignoring the one rank 15 they‚Äôre grouped with to cheese matchmaking), they sure are!
---
I was thinking the same thing, telling a friend. Let's see if we're right.
---
*she
---
&gt;Same reason I was insulted by everyone saying I'm wrong and downvoted.
---
You don't see me insulting you and you assumed I downvoted you, that was an unneeded and uncalled for insult.
---
To me hacking anything like that just means he could be doing more than that and I wouldn't know. While I can sympathize with that story it doesn't really make sense to react by saying you've done nothing wrong and trying to rile up your fans. To me trust is earned and not being a fan of his before that, I can't speak to his character. Just my opinion though.
---
Able to boost  
---
Accurate
---
Such a great scene. The long take of Michael walking from house to house killing people, Carpenter‚Äôs fantastic score; it‚Äôs one of the best scenes in the whole film, maybe the best.
---
Depending on how they implement it, it's either going to be a way worse borrowed time or a slightly better borrowed time.
---
**Stabs in the back with the knife...28 times**

---
A good killer
---
Using flashlights or ds does not make you toxic.  And probably like most streamers , they are getting tired/bored with the game due to the lack of updates over extremely long periods of time, so she found a group of people who keep the game fun for her.  
---
She‚Äôs bad, but nowhere near as bad as OchiDO. At least Jen isn‚Äôt a pedophile or an exploiter. She and her SWF group do seem to lose their minds whenever they all get outplayed by a Killer, especially in the endgame. I remember when someone posted of a video of themselves as Hag beating Jen and her group. They had three flashlights, and four DS, Dead Hard, and Adrenaline and they got extremely salty over Franklin‚Äôs. It wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúno, my item :(‚Äú salt. They were acting as if the perk was OP and that it justified their meta builds. They were also calling the Killer a lot of names and just being pretty toxic. If that isn‚Äôt enough to prove that she and her group should not be Fog Whisperers, then the fact that she purposefully deranks and publicly advertises it should be. 
---
Oh, and don‚Äôt forget EdgarAlanBro. He plays with Jen a lot of the time and does a lot of the same things she does. 
---
&gt; Also the deep wound from frenzy shouldnt trigger nurse calling or maybe you should be able to mend faster. 
---
It doesn't.
---
Would be cool/different if said fog replaced the heartbeat.  This would have the side effect of fog offerings making it easier/harder to tell if this killer is on the way.
---
None of my points were countered, and if they were they weren't countered well.
---
Are you kidding me? This looked absolutely bad ass and the whole sub was flipping out about it:
---
https://youtu.be/nycaCnKqXh4
---
IIRC he owned up to it after saying he'd done nothing wrong and demanding a response from Behavior, inciting his fans, etc. Probably why he's not a fog whisperer.
---
Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted, that‚Äôs exactly (remake) Freddy‚Äôs motivation for killing. He wants revenge on the kids for ratting him out and the adults for killing him, so he goes on a spree offing the now older children. 
---
I believe he already has a nptice for intent to reappeal. Which is bullshit victor miller got paid like 10k for the first friday film. They will make more money if they pay him and start using the ip

Holy hell, randoms do gens on PC?!? Red rank on console randoms rarely do anything once 2 gens are done. Usually it quickly devolves into who can outlast everyone else and get the hatch.

Wrong. Please watch [this short, 5 minute video](https://youtu.be/jqzBaPOnwtQ). This isn't even subjective. 
---
People honestly think Myers is a misunderstood villain? The guy murdered his older sister with no motive other than he was a bad kid. He broke out of Smith‚Äôs Grove and returned to Haddonfield just because he wanted to kill again. Loomis was 100% right, Myers was never redeemable and was evil in the ‚ÄòShape‚Äô of a man. 
---
I used it to get adept laurie and then never again
---
I like to think that they gather by the campfire telling each other horror stories of tbagging and incessant clicking.
---
He is bad though. His ability is literally a hindrance that can be removed easily.
---
So you mean to tell me as a survivor i should adapt to my opponent instead of sticking with my ez win formula? 
---
LeGiOn Op PlZ ReMoVe
---
Survivor is more than likely female. 
---
Oh? Did you use Google to find that wiki quote?
---
"Google is a search engine that can be employed to find a variety of information such as websites, pictures, maps or even just the answer to the crossword clue that‚Äôs been driving you mad all morning!
---
Google uses a computer program called a 'web crawler' that looks at the billions of websites available on the World Wide Web and examines their content to find 'keywords'. Then it indexes these to make the websites easier for the search engine to find. So if you type the word ‚Äòholidays‚Äô in the search box, for instance, Google will then show you all the websites with holiday information."
---
The architecture/iconography in the first teaser is not Egyptian. Unless cherubim are part of Egyptian culture?
---
As much as I like his videos Monto doesn't stream and is pretty much absent from the community, so I actually understand not being a Fog Whisperer. He may not want to be anyway.
---
that is true. I've stopped caring if survivors use ds because i used it a few times a couple weeks ago and the skill check can be pretty tough sometimes
---
I don't know what was so edgy about it. And I can tell by what you're saying that your "ds is such an op perk" mentality comes from the fact you have no idea how to fight against ds.
---
&gt;mass spamming of flash lights
---
An average killer cannot do anything about this, the only way to counter it is by maybe running Franklin‚Äôs demise or that one doctor perk. But that is if you have had the patience to unlock it.
---
As if flashlight spamming does anything. You don't need to counter it, it's not even strong, it literally just causes a clicking noise, why even bring this up, the clicking does nothing except annoy you maybe.
---
&gt;decisive strike
---
&gt;There is little to no counter to it. The only way you can make it potentially harder is with iron grasp. But most likely they will have it as soon as you pick them up.
---
I hate when killers bring up ds as if it is Satan. There is technically no way to counter the perk by definition other than juggling (because they can't hit the skill check) but there are ways to negate the effects of the stun after ds to make it useless, not even do much but wiggle your camera around in some situations. Enduring makes the stun time laughable, you can drop them off a high ledge, and if they don't have balanced landing and you have Enduring, youve almost destroyed their chance at escaping. Also there are places on the map where you can literally body block a survivor in, meaning once they get out your arms they can't go anywhere, so you can also them down again
---
&gt;selfcare
---
&gt;A hard counter to so many killers, especially Freddy. The only way that you could counter this is with a status effect perk. But good fucking luck if it‚Äôs swf, as they will proberbly have one guy being a distraction wither the other two will either be healing him or body blocking you.
---
Itd be a counter to freddy maybe (though with a lot of experience with freddy, it still isn't much of a problem imo), but it's actually very helpful to other killers especially with sloppy butcher, it takes an absurd amount time to self care, giving killer so much extra time when compared to survivors just healing eachother. Self care is so ineffective now that many survivors have ditched the perk for alternatives. This isn't a problem for a skilled killer who runs sloppy butcher. More time healing themselves, less time on a gen.
---
&gt;deliverance
---
&gt;A free get out of jail card wen ever you want to, providing you save another person. This has not perk counter.
---
Did you forget that in order to use deliverance you have to 1) get hooked and 2) safely unhook another survivor. The maximum of 3 people can run this perk and use it in one match (no guarentee that you'll even get to use it) and it still progresses you to the next phase. This perk is basically the "no one will come unhook me, I'll unhook myself" perk. Saying this perk is a free get out of jail free card is like saying another survivor unhooking you is a get out of jail free card.
---
&gt;unbreakable
---
&gt;You can pick yourself up once every round, plus you can recover 25% faster at max. Again no perk counter other than to smack them.
---
Unless you're going against a slugger, this perk usually gets little to no use. The 25 percent faster recovery is nice, but picking yourself up rarely happens. There's a reason this perk isn't exactly the meta, it's because it's WAY too situational to be consistently effective. The counter to this perk is picking survivors up before they can use it. That's why it's situational, and you also get up injured, which is also a drawback to this perk.
---
&gt;So what do killers have to combat this other than no Ed. Nothing.
---
Killers have tons of tools to combat many of the survivors antics. I think you need to play killer and actually get good as killer to tell the majority of what your saying is nonsense.
---
&gt;Btw I‚Äôm saying this as an survivor main. Most killers need a huge buff in terms of what they can do.
---
I'm a killer main actually. A lot of the killers are pretty good where they are right now, maybe a few minor details can be added to make their lives a little easier, but as it stands, unless you're going against 4 survivor gods in a swf using things like discord, you can effectively kill as just about any killer. Not saying there aren't bad killers, just saying if you become good at them, your games go well.
---
I wish I knew how to read 
---
‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm bad and got shit on so I have to camp to secure one kill‚Äù
---
*a bit closer to heaven*
---
I've noticed that the more I play the more my attitude transitions from being 'the nice killer' to 'I don't care about your made up rules, I'll get them 4k'. 
---
Legion
---
The killer is no doubt really enjoying the fact that they're doing nothing but adding 1/4 to the time he has to account. Removing one survivor from the trial as soon as possible is more effective than Ruin or any other method by which to slow the game. 
---
Long story short? Your team's doing nothing but screwing themselves over. 
---
That ‚Äòsexy nurse‚Äô scene was originally gonna be a lot weirder than her just getting devil eyes and a demon tongue. Her face would transform into Freddy, but the rest of her would stay the same, boobs and all. There are even set photos of when they tried it out, but they decided it looks dumb as shit (hence why she just suddenly transforms into Freddy when the camera pans back to her).
---
If this is some sort of Priest or Medieval based killer, then I hope the map is an indoor one based in some massive cathedral or castle. 
---
Would be great to have another indoor map at all, especially one that'll be another option for a good scratched mirror Michael =D
---
Suicide on hook until you‚Äôre back in the ranks where killers don‚Äôt facecamp every game as soon as someone pallet stuns them more than once in a chase 
---
You should be able to view its progress by clicking on the tab next to it that says +(number) in your profile. 
---
They haven't even addressed this issue. It's not a bannable offense if EVERYONE can do it. It stops becoming an exploit when everyone starts doing it. Remember Legion moonwalking? Exploit right? Still in the game right? Ever heard of Legion bans? No right?
---
tthis
---
If I remember correctly, that Hag was a crybaby who hook BMed and whined in chat. Who cares. Also, she stopped deranking after all the whole controversy went down so that‚Äôs a now out of date criticism. She lived at rank 1 after that. I‚Äôm pretty sure Morf used to derank also and no one gave a shit. The only thing she‚Äôs done lately is DCed at the END of some games at the beginning of rank reset to not reach red too quickly and have ridiculous queues. That‚Äôs perfectly reasonable.

Iron Will is one of the best perks in the game. It's not niche at all.
---
It's the Grineer.
---
"Darkwing SC" ? No, I am also just "Darkwing Dork" on steam.
---
Yeah actually it is have a look xD Either one of us could be right we'll just have to wait I guess
---
All I see is Daddy Myers in the corner. Did... no one else see him? 
---
&gt; But I got to know, why should a Billy that dick-rides BBQ/Chili and Hex-Ruin get the same amount of BP as a higher skill-cap killer like the Nurse or Michael Myers? 
---
Because if a Billy is using BBQ, they're probably not camping, which is the #1 reason for REEEE'ing among survivors. 
---
Nobody: \*insert Freddy joke\*
---
I was thinking something similar but be able to teleport into the smoke. That would be bad ass.
---
I seriously try to derank so i don't have to hit 1 again, and it's harder than ranking up üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Make fun of Legion I suppose 
---
lmfao 
---
You people disgust me
---
Personally, if they did implement a totem counter, put it on small game. Killers need a perk to see how many dulls they have, though granted it's only useful to them for NOED. 
---
Putting it on small game would also make it less of a perk unfairly called a "meme perk".
---
I honestly don't know, but I'm hoping so.
---
Look at the bottom of that thing he's holding, looks like one of those ridged honey scoopers.
---
I'm looking at something not remotely close to Egyptian architecture. 
---
But we already got Jeff duh
---
That would be pretty cool
---
Can we get a gif of delivery boy Dwight doing the Spider-man "Pizza Time" please.
---
You're not even that close to the next phase yet. What she's doing is fine
---
The original argument is that Legion has no counter-play, when there's obvious counter-play. Spread out, do gens.
---
The argument in the video is "Legion is skill-less because they chase consistently." ignoring that the game is hardly made up only of chases and also ignoring that even in that very video there's perks that counter Legion's Frenzy in chase, like Sprint Burst, and that Legion can't exploit their movement speed to cheese windows and pallets like Spirit can, which means Survivors are hardly at a loss for agency at all times within a chase against Legion.
---
This is just another example of the community latching onto something and making a big fuss over it for no reason. Legion is a low-tier killer with less map pressure than everyone but Freddy and, maybe, Trapper.
---
Rest assured, she very much hates you too for even trying with that pallet. 
---
This would only be true if she allowed him to go into struggle phase
---
&gt;Lol, so repeated flash saves just are annoying. Ok.
---
Flashlight spamming and flashlight saves are two entirely different things, should use the correct terminology. Also there are many ways to combat this, especially with the pick up time being 3 seconds and blinds taking a second, flashlight saves are ineffective unless you're a flashlight god and the killer is pretty brain dead. Also lightborn makes flashlights take 3 seconds to blind the killer, meaning having lightborn makes this basically impossible. Also also you can spam the drop button to negate the flashlight save, this method is so effective I actually thought it was a glitch because it looks like it. Flashlight saves are just annoying if you know how to handle them lol.
---
&gt;With no disrespect, That‚Äôs utter bullshit. The only perk that can heal you is adrenaline and surprise, most people who have unlocked run it.

Adrenaline doesnt just heal you though, it gives you a pretty long speed boost, and you don't have to take about 20 seconds for adrenaline to activate, self care takes more than 20 seconds with sloppy butcher, making it very time consuming. I believe gens take 90 seconds to complete, you're wasting 20+ of those seconds on healing when you can be wasting much less by healing with your team. Also it's not a problem with swf. If you are in a swf and youre running self care, you and your team is wasting time.

&gt;Which is what the majority of killers are, except trapper, Michael, leather face/hillbilly

Slugging is a play style. Literally any killer can do it, it's kind of funny you say Michael and hillbilly wouldn't slug much considering those two killers have tons of reasons to slug, and often do, Michael being his tier 3 is on a timer and hillbilly because he has tons of mobility and lethality. Also trappers tend to as well when it comes to someone falling in their traps while someone is on the ground.

&gt;That‚Äôs when ds kicks in.
---
That isn't a problem with unbreakable, and again, there are ways to combat ds you just so happen to have conveniently skip over when I've explained them
---
&gt;I do, I love Michael and I‚Äôm about to prestige him.
---
Why even say this? As if you prestieging Michael all of a sudden makes you a god killer who plays killer a lot. You literally said you were a survivor main.
---
&gt;The edgy LoL GeT GuD retort. You are not a killer main, no killer mains would say that. Begone thot. I bet you are a prestige 3 Claudette in disguise.
---
I didn't even say git gud to be edgy, I said it because it's the truth. There are so many killers who expect to be served a golden platter of sacrifices, when in reality killer does take skill, and if you don't have any skill at killer you will complain about things you do have control over. I'm a killer main, do I really have to pm you my progress on all the killers to prove that? I'm actually really close to having them all p3 level 50, I just need clown, spirit, and legion.

You clearly have a thick skull and I don't know why I'm going to argue this because it won't get through

If you bothered to read what's bannable and what's not, there are 2 things that pop out here, 1) holding the game hostage, where your new argument is "everyone" can get into it, and "Exploit bugs, errors in design or **undocumented features** to gain access to what would otherwise not be available or to obtain any **competitive advantage"** 
---
what's your argument now?

Please do. Nothing will happen

Actually thinking along the lines of black/blood pope/cardinal, due to the jewelry on the hand.
