Pretty good job so far

Maybe? I've seen people mentioning selling them as stickers, but I honestly have no idea what the intricacies are of the legality around selling fan art for profit. I've already looked it up, and since the only surefire way I could find that would avoid a lawsuit is asking for a license from the copyright holder, I guess that's where I gotta start.
---
Nah it was default David lol. Seems it is happening a lot.
---

---
What competent devs. "Here, we're going to implement a timer system, and not bother to check what happens if the killer is still carrying the survivor when it runs out!"
---
Seconding this;
---
When it's Dead Hard I can just bait out the dead hard and smack them.
---
Adrenaline you can either be near them to smack them down, hold onto them, or hook them.
---
DS you can chase someone else, slug them, or just eat it.
---
These are all things you can do regardless of what killer you're playing as. There's skill to countering those perks and it comes down to knowledge, doesn't matter if you're playing Trapper or Wraith.
---
Against MoM though? There's literally nothing you can do as Trapper except hope that the idiot runs into your traps or camp them dead so you don't have to deal with it. The first part isn't going to work, and no one wants the second part.

---
Nurses is god tier, right under ruin and bbq. I've found so many survivors in their weakest position thanks to this perk
---
Listen, I get it that in theory one bit shoudnt really be that detrimental but practically in games as you said you play killer, downing then near a pallet mind game and them not going down while they're on their death hook or them vaulting a window in front of an exit and not going down when you successfully hit them really hurts the killer and ya know?  We legit can't do anything to avoid it? Or counter it or try to soften its blow on the overall pressure we have.
---
We used to not have to deal with virtual currency...  
---
This is one of the most grindy games ever and progression literally affects gameplay if you consider bloodpoints give you in game items.  Something as core as doing gens should not break lmao stop defending these guys.
---
People who play this game, I tell you....
---
"We're getting sick and tired of high ranks because all it is is Billy and Nurse!"
---
"Well, we could do this and this that would allow those other killers to be more viable, but it would require Survivor Nerfs."
---
"What, NOOOOOOOOOOO!"
---
And shit just saw your username and  I just realized we have actually discussed about killers and bloodweb and RNG in the past, so...
---
What's good homie?
---
Why is there not a hotfix for this?
---
Did you warn them? I mean if 2008 called the least you could have done was warn them of the tumpacalypse 8 years hence
---
The claudettes with the bright pink clothes
---
This reminds me of how I deal with toxicity in games. (Namely league.) I sexually harass /sexually advance on said angry player until they mute me or shut up. Seeing my team enjoy it is also good.
---
I thought it was 15?
---
Watch out we got a badass over here
---
Some nerfs I would propose
---
4 stacks instead of three to activate MOM
---
Giving the broken effect after MOM is proc. 
---
Aura reading will be permanent regardless of the distance, After activating MOM. 
---
Just something more harsher than the bs "aura reading outside 16m WHEN FULLY HEALED"
---
Adrenaline: Holy shit the amount of times this perk has saved my doomed ass is astronomical.
---
Decisive Strike: Underrated after the nerf, but I think it's more viable than before. Basically like having a more reliable Borrowed Time.
---
Devour Hope: A very niche perk, if survivors don't come across it before the third token, it's amazing how scared the survivors will be of you. Usually gets cleansed before the second token for me, but maybe you have better luck.

Exactly what this dude says... There are imbalances on both sides. Just suck it up and go next one...

That's Tapp XD

Wack

Personally I think it comes down to playstyle and running Sloppy with it. I usually don’t run Nurse’s simply because I am pretty confident in my sound whoring and I normally don’t play close to hooks which is where the majority of healing goes down. I also find it difficult to squeeze Nurse’s into a lot of builds if you run BBQ. I think it’s borderline op if you play around it properly with high mobility but other than that there’s other more general use perks that offer more value.
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, BBQ &amp; Chili, Bamboozle, A Nurse's Calling, Hex: Ruin, etc.
---
u/ZombieHuggerr
---
Neas and claudettes
---
God I hope we can get this version. Prefer it over default
---
Not much. Just trying to concoct ways to make the game balanced for everyone. It's a big issue man. The ranking system makes it worse though. I feel like low ranked problems aren't the same as high ranked issues if that makes sense. Something in this game can be a huge issue for some players but no issue at all for the next guy. It's insane but it needs to be acknowledge. Like MoM is totally fair if a survivor isnt great at loops. Then you  turn around and it's unfair for a killer that is having a hard match. Then on a good survivor it's unfair because it's making someone impossible to get. You turn around again and for a super good killer it's a minor inconvenience.
---
This is art.
---
Oh I was doing that, my bad.
---
***Bless you, child. Miss Piggy approves.***
---
Save the Best for Last is such a great perk. Not on every killer, but it really helps out the lower mobility ones, and with Freddy being my favorite killer, it's a godsend.
---
Is it bad that I laughed at this?
---
I had lost survivors after being flashlighted before, as well as could effectively hide after blinding killer, so in my personal experience it can work. But it's kind of hard to pull off without Iron Will and Quick and Quiet, yet still
---
Damn that’s toxic
---
I... wha? 2 minutes turns into 4 minutes if you slow down the timer to half speed. You're doing the wrong math here I'm afraid.
---
Yup. It's annoying for sure, but I don't see it as toxic as well, and also see it as somewhat effective action in some cases
---
The way I play killer is I just stack bbq so I hook everyone once and then I should hook everyone twice after that before gates are powered. That's when I weed out all my MoM users. After that everyone should be on death hook. If this playstyle doesn't work for me I just dont get a lot of sacrifices that match. So for me I never have people use MoM to escape. If I activate it when I ideally want it activated and get the hooks the way I want it's just a extra loop or second. Most of the people who use it in my matches dont get to use it to extend the chase. For me it's not big deal unless it's looking like I'm going to lose the match. Then it can be used to take advantage of me if I get caught by surprise and that's a minor downside to me. That doesnt mean I dont get that others may feel different about it. I think the perk needs to remain useful and end up with the same result. I just think it needs to be leveled to the point it feels fair for everyone.
---
kinda had a pic in my head of Myers x Pig with pig holding their new baby ghostface
---
Weird glitch
---
Yeah im waiting till he gets reworked to play him, just playing my billy boi and p3ing freddy with those bps while i wait. Sweater boi shall soon be feared!
---
don't make me have a crush on the pig 
---
don't make me have a crush on the pig- goddammit.
---
I’m literally quoting (paraphrasing) the devs during their last YouTube video talking about EGC, tho.
---
Happened to me too. My boyfriend and some random Meg got kicked out while i and the other person stayed. So weird.
---
With ruin or w/out ruin.
---
Love your art style!
---
I hate this, they ruin the game for everyone else just because they are butthurt they aren’t doing amazing.
---
Yep it's fine having my rank reset in LoL because it happens once a year (not to mention that your placement in the next season is determined by your previous position much more accurately than rank X goes down to rank Y every time)
---
Agreed. Each of these perks can be dealt with on their own...
---
But having somebody be unhooked with borrowed time, activating their adrenaline, and the unhooker having mettle while they all run to the exit gate to t-bag is cancer.
---
Communication isn't fair?

I know, Im a Legion Main since release and also would never Change my Main because of some Problem with it.

Was just a suggestion if someone really has Problems with MoM

We love you. &lt;3
---
Nea has the best spot :)
---
I'm not sure what platform you are playing on but I legit just played 5 matches with zero sacrifices because all I get paired with are shitty try hard survivors who bully you. 
---
I'm not saying I'm a great killer, in fact when it comes down to it I'm pretty bad, but generally I can play a match and get at least one sacrifice. 
---
I don't know if it's the fact I've been playing leatherface or what because I don't have this issue with other killers. Regardless it's so annoying because it starts chase when they are like 10 feet away from you and you either spend 5 minutes running in a circle to either get hit with a pallet or you get lucky and actually hit them and the chase goes on forever while the other survivors are busy finishing all the generators... 
---
Like am I doing something wrong? Or does matchmaking just hate me? I want to enjoy this game but I can't when I can't when get a single sacrifice in 5 games.
---
“From where you’re hanging this must seem like a 28 hundred bloodpoint run of bad matchmaking.  But the truth is?  You were a bitch from the start.”- Freddy
---
Wow. Turns out Ghostface stalks and is a serial killer. Who could have known?
---
It is not my art style, as mentioned in the title.
---
It's disturbing the number of times in post-game killers accuse solo survivors of doing SWF when they're just coordinated properly like decent players. What I'm getting increasingly concerned about is how bitter killers have become in the past few months. It's getting disturbing, like people really need a mental break from this game.
---
Just got Adept Wraith today because of reset. Just need Billy and Nurse for the Platinum. Nurse is going to suck.
---
Serial Killer part was little too obvious on my part. But the stalking part could've not been added to his background and it could've just been written off as "He watched SaW and Halloween and Took notes on how Amanda and Myers Stalked people"
---
True but I thought I could get that Jake in time, sadly I paid the price for trying
---
Just take a break and play Sid Meier's Civilization V.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Actually what I would recommend is finding out what things are frustrating or break the fun for you, and then try to narrow them down as specifically as possible. Come up with a list, put it on here, and the community can start a conversation about each item and the distilled result can be petitioned to the devs, along with proposed solutions. I do not know how receptive the devs are to feedback (I imagine they are only allotted a few hours of internet time a week between making skins), but it would be worth a shot.
---
Or just wait it out and see if the game gets more fun after a few more versions roll out.
---
Then you just wait at the gates while the killer closes the hatch so you can get a headstart, or find the hatch first. 
---
I'm tired of seeing 50 millon posts about this
---
how is nea one of the least likely rofl
---
Well throughout Scream every Ghostface stalked the protagonists. Like I remember clearly that one scene in the first movie where one of the killers was in a bush stalking Sydney.
---
In what alternate universe did they not all DC and give hatch to their 4th man?
---
Just cause you're corn blind doesn't make the map bad for nurse.
---
Nurse has no bad maps, she's overpowered on all of them.
---
wow the killer tried killing you loool must have been a surprise. Just pointing out you're part of the problem
---
The last 2 killer perks depend on the killer. Enduring/spirit fury is the best and most flexible combo to run with BBQ and ruin imo.
---
I want Silent Hill nurse outfit for our nurse :

My teammate tried killing me. On my eyes he got what he deserved
---
Survivor: Decisive Strike, Mettle of Man, Dead Hard, Adrenaline 
---
Killer: Ruin, BBQ, Enduring+Spirit Fury or Sloppy+Nurse’s Calling.
---
No None of the ghostfaces never stalked Sidney from a bush. They attacked her in her home most of the time. Ghostfaces technically stalk but they don't. They attack people they know personally (like stu attacking his ex girlfriend Casey Becker in the opening of Scream 1) they don't stalk them they walk up to their house, one breaks in, one does the phone call, and one kills the person they're targeting.
---
You’re arguing hypotheticals. Apparently you know everything about the game and every exact situation. Like when the killer snaps the hatch shut as soon as it spawns and both gates are right next to each other. Cool. Now your argument is invalid. You aren’t discussing, you aren’t helping. Try thinking before insulting another. 
---
If you’re tired of these post, unsubscribe.
---
No. Have you seen any of the leaked gameplay? As far as I can tell while Ghostface shares the terms of their powers, they have different uses. If you haven't looked at the leaked videos and such don't read the rest of this then.
---
&gt;!Like, Michael stalks to charge up his Evil Within and it changes his stats a bit. Terror Radius, Movement Speed, 1 hit downs and I think vault speed. From what I seen I think Ghostface's stalking will cause the exposed effect on the person stalked.!&lt;
---
&gt;!The Pig on the other hand has RBTs, that's the main gimmick with her. Her crouch a lot of people don't seem to really even use but it removes her Terror Radius and after that short charge up gives her a really far and fast lunge. !&lt;
---
&gt;!Ghostface seems like he's being designed to play very stealth oriented. He can go next to a corner and lean to reveal himself a very small amount, crouch so he's harder to see over objects, his stalk seems to be a charge up on individual survivors, etc. It really does seem like a different play style and goal from both Michael and The Pig. Not counting add-ons changing gameplay aspects, Michael's normal goal is either say tier 1 and try to make use of his small terror radius and lack of the stain to get the jump on people and mind game easier OR time getting to tier 3 to get a quick down with all the added bonuses and hopefully chain it into multiple downs. The Pig aims to try and get people down as soon as possible to begin with delaying generators by having survivors trying to clear the RBT and possibly other survivors not finishing gens to give them time.!&lt;
---
Swear this happens to me so much as pig. I go for a stealthy grab on a gen and get the grab animation just for me to not hit anybody at all and have them freely run away from the gen. AT LEAST GIVE ME A HIT TO PUT THEM IN INJURED STATE #%%##%
---
-20K blood points would be a good start.
---
And Clementine would have damn well survived living with Ana.
---
Happy cake day!
---
You literally didn't mention a survivor in your post. you're gladly stating you DC and don't care even though it ruins the game for killers and other survivors. pretty petty
---
I could see this being a great killer with some tweaking to the overheat perk (how long does true savior last?)
---
It’s because it’s very situational, and most of the time they don’t heal in your terror radius. Also, Italy’s very easy to tell if they have nurses.
---
I got put to rank 14 killer and all the survivors I go against dc
---
Take a break for a few days. That's what I did. I came back and enjoyed most of it my time playing.
---
You're a good sport for not dc'ing. I'm a pretty trash survivor, but I know the gist of it; a friend and I last night played against a killer that didn't have a good game. Once the gens were done he opened the gate and went far away from the gates, and we all left promptly. He even typed ggwp in the chat before leaving. THOSE are the good sports I hope to come across, that and survivors that promptly leave unlike your Claudette. Everyone's got bad games, stick it out and you'll improve. Disconnecting robs yourself an opportunity to learn how to improve. I lose entire games sometimes because I find a survivor that is incredibly good at evading me so I practice my chases with that one survivor. Yes, killing people / escaping and gaining blood points is amazing, but so is practicing. GL out there, OP.
---
Well do you stand there and watch them after you hook them?
---
Detailed Victims Routine sounds more like it's about what the victim does at what times (Alarm goes off at 5:30, leaves house at 6:30, arrives at work at 6:51) over what a killer should have to do.
---
It's the *victim's* routine, that's very detailed.
---
It's not even on PC yet, but the connection seems worse this days, I played against 2 stop-motion davids, but the rest of the survivors were fine.
---
I have never had this problem. Whenever I use a key, I can do it from any angle. My character just teleports in front of the hatch and plays the animation.
---
idk why dead hard is in there, that one isn't really annoying
---
I just go for bloodpoints and hope for a depip
---
Yeah pretty much I just left my piggy and started playing huntress but eventually it gets boring for a while playing a slow killer.
---
Yo as you're a legion main. I purchased the new legion on my pc yesterday and wanted to know after post ptb what will be the best perks and addons for him.
---
Will appreciate some advice, thanks bud.
---
No I play billy and down them very early into the game I almost never stay anywhere near the hook I chainsaw away to find more usually with bbq but even if I dont see any I go to a gen
---
Yes, games would be so boring and unfun if there weren't 4 insta heals, 4 purple flashlights, 4 mettle of man, 4 adrenaline.., should i continue?
---
Decisive striking changes the obsession now
---
Nor really long, maybe 30 seconds
---
I kind of find it stupid too. Rancor is basically NOED except you can’t Mori your obsession
---
Is that the only way right now? An I’m guessing it was added last patch?
---
Apparently DCing is a sign of superior skill.
---
I wish you luck for the next time you run into a jake 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
---
Anything for screaming, doc, infections fright, clown etc
---
Still would be lame if two people couldn't run something like Self Care, or We're Gonna Live Forever. Or 2 toolboxes. 
---
Even multiple MoM and such isn't a big deal, it's only a problem when all 4 survivors are running "Wombo Combos". Full Meta Builds across all 4 survivors with items, addons, and builds designed to squeeze every ounce of advantage out of them.
---
I think people have been asking for the Headless (Horseless) Horseman for a while now.
---
Apart from maybe Ghostface, Pinhead, and Chucky, Harry Warden and H. Horseman are two of the bigger ones.
---
It was added when they changed DS 
---
And yes that's the only way
---
I took a 6 month break (was red rank before quitting), logged in a scatter time for a game but couldn’t get back into it for a while. Started playing last week at rank 15 ish, was a nightmare until I climbed a few ranks, and then it was easy mode, and now being back to the nightmare sucks lol
---
Activate cloak mode
---
You can do slow, med, or fast
---
Slow is walking
---
Med is running but not enough run up
---
Fast is a 10 m run up I believe
---
I don’t know what that is
---
One of my best moments was when I downed a survivor who threw the shack pallet on my head then it disappears and I stand up immediately with an injured fang min staring me down.
---
So i just need to be moving from a far distance. I see.
---
Survivors can always drop the pallet early when they figure out that you have it. Not a bad bit of counterplay.
---
Really? This subreddit is easily impressed...

Right, it’s the same exact thing. I’d even take “oh you can’t mori until all 5 are done”... but that exposed should still be active. :/
---
The hooked survivor.
---
Most important thing as a newbie is to play both killer and survivor. At least enough to know how each side works.
---
Windows of Opportunity great perk for new people Comes with Kate
---
She'd find a way out
---
Yeah. The only way everyone would be happy is if they built or reworked perks into what players find reasonably fair. Maybe one day
---
I want a tall, strong woman to hold me and tell me everything is going to be alright.
---
I don’t like it but the game also forces some DCs like insta down hatches and camping that just make the game unfun
---
Is this perk a must have ? Should I be leveling up clown as a new player for bamboozle? Is that a piroity? Im trying to level up leather face atm for bbq, I already got the doctor perk from the store so that was nice.
---
Well yeah.
---
But i mean maybe more like, punishment for disconnecting every other match.
---
Lol, I have used to have a Shiny Glaceon in Platinum.
---
But yeah, on PC red ranks aren’t worth once you get the achievement.
---
Maybe one day... See you in the fog fam
---
Glad I had a civil discussion with someone in here!
---
Oh yeah that’s just dumb but I hear rank 1 half the game are unplayable but I don’t know if that is true
---
Me to take care friend.
---
I don't even care about the rank 1 acheivement, honestly.
---
Mind, I don't disconnect, I usually just joke around when I stop caring (Doing a daily for a killer I hate, for instance), but if I hover between 12-8, I'm good.
---
Wait? Shouldn't the cap be at 1mil? 
---
Am I about to be whooshed?
---
MoM is not any more stupid than Leatherface being able to down up to 4 full health players, in one hit &amp; at the same time.
---
Just don't get to worked up about kills. I generally play calm and just mess around I also recommend trying to do a perkless killer challenge to add spice in some games. I also recommend grinding out all your killers to p3 if you don't have anything to do.
---
I usually hover purple ranks. You still get diversity there.
---
Thanks
---
I’m just clueless at who to play honestly lol like the killers I actually find fun I do trash with and I play them all the time too
---
If you have a better idea feel free to post it smartass.
---
The killer can open the exit gate regardless of how many generators are completed. This is a pivotal point of the EGC update as it allows the killer to forfeit a match without requiring them to disconnect from the game and lose all their earned bloodpoints.
---
There's more to it than just disabling vsync.
---
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502775242
---
You can also adjust things so that it runs at your monitors native resolution
---
What system are you on? I'm playing 2.7.0 on PC and this is not possible.
---
Is this a joke only Meg mains can understand or something? 🙃
---
So I just found the scene. Sidney and her friend are talking and when they walk away the camera zooms in on Ghostface in the trees.
---
I'm on Playstation 4. You can walk up to the exit gate at any point and just hit the switch, triggering EGC.
---
I love playing trapper now for fun more than kills. Then if I de-pip, I can have more fun with using traps at lower ranks instead of focusing on kills. I find it’s more fun, rank is useless anyways and then everyone gets more BPs from it.
---
We need more dbd sfm.
---
I'd say play pallet destroyer clown. Basically enduring bamboozled and brutal strength. Would say spirit fury but you don't have it I'm guessing. Or do gatekeeper trapper with blood warden dying light,NOED and remember me. I think gatekeeper trapper will be fun with endgame.
---
Have you tried doing trappers basement before? It’s super fun, if you focus more on trapping loops, the basement etc imo anyway
---
I played the clown a bit but I couldn’t get a handle of when to use his ability
---
I actually barely play the trapper so I haven’t tried him much
---
Yet I've seen more Survivors DC when they're the first down or get killed when either the gates are open or they got hatch grabbed, as opposed to when a killer has to deal with a 4E. I don't care if survivors escape via the hatch or gates considering that some of the most fun and interesting games I've had haven't been 4Ks, but I do care if they act like an ass about it and harass/threaten me for things I did/didn't do during the match.
---
It depends on who owns it? Two companies to go through for one character is a lot. It's that way with people wanting original Freddie's skin. Idk if they would do it but if they tried it out I bet people who buy it up.
---
RBT aren't meant to kill you, silly. 🤭
---
Yes but he’s not out yet and neither are his perks lol
---
How could BHVR do this smh my head 😤😤😤
---
Nobody. 
---
She was a 16 year old who willingly sold her soul to the entity so she could avenge the people she loved.
---
Lore-wise, I picture her as a very pessimistic and depressed person; someone who knows they've done bad things but doesn't regret any of the things they've done one bit. 
---
I don't think anyone really wants to spend time with her and I think she likes it that way. There's no way she's romantically or sexually involved with anyone IMO.
---
(But that's just my head canon.)
---
His ability is great once you get the hang of it. He is great and fun killer because he stops loops fast with his gas.
---
Hope not
---
Yeah I pretty much only run survivor and this pisses me off so much.  You can still get taken off the hook, and if the killer is a camper it takes some pressure off the rest of us fixing generators.  People who DC are a cancer.  Especially if it’s within the first 30 seconds of a round starting.
---
Lol “how could BHVR do this shaking my head my head”
---
I’d try it out, it can be so much fun. I used to main Michael lol
---
I just don't really enjoy most matches above rank 5 anyway as a survivor most of the time.
---
Mostly just sweaty Nurses and Billys at that point, at least on PC anyway.
---
I’ll give him another try
---
I was hoping it was a joke most people would understand
---
So like a sleepy hollow type killer? Idk how a horse would work out that thing would be huge.
---
Yeah Michael was the first killer I ended up truly maining I got him to level 49 then I just fell off with him, used to get 4ks nearly every match now can barely get 2
---
Surprise Dean Lewis?
---
Such a P3 Claudette
---
Sorry Captain, didn't seem to work. Am I just screwed?
---
Damn! Bunny Mom looking metal AF!
---
That’s only possible with 5 gens.  You start it early by closing hatch. You can’t open both doors or close hatch and open a door.
---
My apologies, I've never heard of that before. I figured they'd keep something like that consistent across platforms.
---
I mean everyone has that reaction when the drawing cuts like 2 inches from her waist and her cup size moves up a letter. Not complaining though.
---
I’m still learning could you explain what made it obvious or what to look for. Thanks
---
i see thank you! topic closed then
---
Well she has a geisha, schoolgirl and now ANOTHER geisha outfit, hopefully they eventually add a haircut that just hangs down like the Ring.
---
everyone wants a piece of that huntr-ass
---
Yes bish! This happened to me so much the other day. Thought it was just me.

Feels good to me as a clown main that he’s become the face of killers in these multi-panel memes.

If it gives a noise and a red circle fades over them as if hit, they disconnected, if it’s just straight away no sound they lost connection some other way
---
It was acting weird for me as well. Im gonna check later.
---
What are you talking about? I meant Reverse Bear Traps.
---
It was a nooby spirit, and she comes with that perk which is what made it obvious

Thumbnail is stolen from google images, im bad at photoshop etc

there should be a button in the top right corner of the window, it looks like this:

What a sad little man you are :)

To my knowledge the movie is a different license than the mask. Seems maybe they only got the mask license.

Why did you delete your old comment just to replace it with this one? Did you think this one was better? Cause it isn't lmao. And you know you can edit comments, right?
---
*you fucking wot m8*
---
Everyone I’ve talked too has a high affinity for Ace. I disagree strongly on a lot of your list (Exclusion of Ash and Nea’s and David’s placements.) but Ace Mains are the best people in this game. They are usually either new players wearing the tux or they are veterans that have ran out of things to do so they run meme builds. They are good players but don’t take the game seriously at all so they die really quick.
---
This makes me wanna get back into SFM again. I think I just refound a hobby.
---
I wanted you to see what a sad little man you are :) 
---
Now you can go back into the hole.

I always have a soft place for my baby Dwight
---
The only way to make up for the nerfs she got, really.
---
Also, the EGC for her should totally be people dying to the nerve gas from the Nerve Gas House instead of the Entity. ~~Which should also be a map please~~
---
You recommented to get me to reply? First of all, I don't believe you. Second of all, that's extremely sad. Almost as sad as your English is abhorrent.
---
Yes.
---
He knows
---
no don’t you know nurse is the most op killer and anyone who has played her for five games gets a guaranteed 4K because she basically has wallhacks and is unwinnable against /s
---
Please, for the love of God, don’t make risky hook saves unless you have Borrowed Time or are willing to take a hit.
---
Ok. So he's just saying that they're meant to keep you from doing anything?
---
Yeah, and then you depip because they dc cause they are a crybaby.
---
Good game.
---
boi you got outplayed!!
---
This is so accurate.
---
I usually sacrifice myself for anyone on the hook if the killer camps. Otherwise I wait for them to leave
---
I feel like it's weird BHVR just paying Kyle Galner just to have the likeness to the clothes he was wearing in a film from 9 years ago
---
If you’re a survivor main, all you should ever really need is one exhaustion perk, WGLF and 2 whatever you want. If you don’t care about BPs then exhaustion + 3.
---
It has something to do with the naked model for sure. If you don’t know naked modes exist for all characters and cosmetics go on top of the naked model so yeah, there is a Shirtless Myers and Shirtless Clown in the files. Nea’s p2 shirt only has blood on the top, not the skin. The blood on her skin is probably underneath her naked model.
---
Then thats a siutation that you lose, its RNG and it happens. 
---
But there are also times when it does happen, your not helping either. 
---
And im not subbed. 
---
My point is, there is counter play to it, but its also RNG based and it happens
---
That’s the way it’s supposed to be done, but a lot of people just want the points and will “save” you with the Killer standing two feet away.
---
Shit sucks.
---
Looks more like lag or bug
---
Maybe the horse is just as fast as the survivor. This guy would be huge, and definitely not very stealthy, but i think it could work. Plus we already have a horse in the clown's map, so we have a model for one already.
---
I never realized how alike Claudette and Meg look lol
---
Use med kits or another survivor. Self Care isnt worth it is.
---
People tend not to like players that play mostly one side and are rude about it. See how no one mentioned Jen in this thread even though she is a Fog Whisperer LOL
---
Not if your good.
---
"Yes! the ruin." 
---
\*cleanses\*
---
h a u n t e d   g r o u n d s
---
"ahh shit "
---
It depends. Adept is based on your emblems at the end of the match. RBT kills count just a much to the Devout (kills) emblem as anything else does but can impact other emblems.
---
Gatekeeper - Basically not affected, if anything it's improved because gens should be completed slower.
---
Devout - Killing all survivors in any way gives Gold, to get Iridescent you need at least 9 hooks, meaning if they die to a reverse bear trap after only being hooked once, you need to ensure you get a lot of hooks per kill on everyone else.
---
Malicious - Gains points from hits and hook stages. Again if you don't hook them several times this emblem loses points, and if they die early you probably haven't chased and hit them many times.
---
Chaser - Again, if they die to an RBT before you've encountered them a lot, you're losing points for chasing and hitting them.
---
Overall it's much the same as a mori, it's fine to get kills that way, but if you want to get merciless for the adept, you ideally want them dying that way after they've been caught and hooked at least twice or you're losing out on emblems.
---
How do those force DCs? Just play the fucking game instead of quitting
---
Dwight, Nea, and Ace are the cuntiest of them all. Gotta kill 'em all!
---
Definitely go for bbq first then get bamboozle. bbq is a perk that is a huge convenience for all killer's and reduces the grind,then bamboozle is perk that's great for chasing especially at killer shack.
---
Lol i could see, mobile
---
Matchmaking is not random. You will be matched with people at your rank if possible. That's why red rank queue times are so long.
---
huh
---
I'm not sure. Dimension owns scream which is owned by another company itself. Mtv scream lists the Weinstein company as the owner but they sold out to the same people who own dimension so presumably it should all be in once place.
---
Here’s a better idea: don’t disconnect like a little bitch or you go in the timeout corner
---
So you just have to double pip with that character's perks?
---
I am down with a headless dude with a sabre and tossing exploding pumpkins. Double points it he is full ham with taunts.
---
So, just to be clear because I might be confused. I am talking about specifically flashing during stun and at pallet break. Good survivors have done well time blinds on me and its worked. 
---
I just mean whenever I get flashed at a pallet stun it usually amounts to getting my vision back to see someone tbagging or running in a straight line.
---
With all the issues with licenses it's probably not worth their money to collect:
---
* Ghostface
---
* The movie mask
---
* The movie outfit
---
* The MTV mask/outfit
---
Considering it's basically JUST for cosmetics, it would be a lot of money committed just to get a different version of the character.
---
spirit fury enduring ruin bbq: thats the meta
---
I think it'd be cool to have him laugh menacingly like freddy or doctor, and instead of a sabre, I actually think his traditional weapon of a whip made out of a spine would work.
---
It could also be eariler if he ends up not being a chapter.
---
Reagents: bloodpoint sink
---
Myself considering shes my wife.
---
It is. The movie is a differnet licnce from the mask, and thus they cant use the ropes unless they got the movie and cant use the mask without the mask..so you need two.
---
That was Wi-Fi right there
---
Yep, gotta be just their 3 perks, no fourth, but you can use any add ons and offerings.
---
Thank you!
---
Looks like runescape abilities
---
That’s why we wear different outfits; otherwise we’re practically identical!
---
Comparing a video game emote to bombing a country.. ok dude you're dumb af..
---
Wait, how would Nvidia limit my framerate?
---
Folks, I'm not saying that killers don't do this, but survivors do it more often.
---
I get a GG in the post game chat 2/11 matches when versing survivors, but when I verse Killers I get about 8/11 GGs
---
You're saying it is on this game??
---
Dont have that issue I dont use selfcare. Secondly I play on console and you can change the actions to different triggers.
---
While you are correct, i just wish the season was longer than a month.
---
I got tips when I got a 2K as the Plague rather than reported and called names.  We had a civil conversation and I had a good laugh.  The guy's friend DCed cause I Mori'ed him, and he said he was so salty he went offline.
---
I always say "gg that was fun, gl in the next one" because you can't let anyone know they've bothered you because that is what they want.
---
Personally I think wraith should move down and pig should move up just above legion
---
Lmao I would die laughing if I got that message
---
You’re probably just a bad killer then... I only play plague and wraith and have zero problems when i use wraith.
---
Pig just above freddy?
---
*hard disagree*
---
I’d put her at c tier lowest, but probably more around b tier
---
What? They're probably using discord or some other third party voice chat.
---
HEY ! I use them on stealth killers !

Cleansing NOED as a Solo Survivor Guide:
---
1. Go up to dull totem
---
2. Hold space
---
3. Feel good for using intended counter-play instead of whining about fair perks.
---
You realize that they don’t want killers to get 4K’s every match, right? This thread is full of stupid. Lmao.
---
Doeant make it fair
---
Example
---
Bunch of solos looking for hex, one finds it but you down them, while others keep looking for the totem
---
Meanwhile same cenario for swf would be different as they woupd know exactly where the torem is
---
You really will leave these pecs like that - david probably
---
I woudnt say I am bad or terrible but I also woudnt say I am better than most  either. I reached rank 6 as huntress and pig under 150 hours
---
But when if there is a perk which single handedly ruins your experience it hurts and I genuinely don't know if you're playing against idiots running deja VU and premonition, because I feel like every m1 killer is a bit frustrated with the new character (ash), it's like playing a low tier killer against surviors with such crutch perks hurts either if you're God killer who plays wraith.
---
I am on pc so take that into consideration as well.
---
I mained him when I just started the game in summer of 2018, until I get red ranks and started getting shit on. Can’t wait to come back to something decent!!
---
So do I
---
Same. I run bond and spinechill in every build
---
I’ll consider it. Thanks!
---
I almost always do that but killers just disconnect without replying  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
The only time when i don't do it is when im tunneled without a reason.
---
What? People bully Paulie? What's wrong with them? HE'S SUCH A NICE MAN
---
Kinda looks to close to the kitty mask but I do like the coat
---
Only reason i got it was because the killer was afk the whole match lol
---
Amazing! 😂
---
Get a life survivor dick rider
---
Fuck pig mains, most annyoing people in this reddit forums, of course after the shirtless Myers beggers.
---
Me too. At the same time I hate and love getting that salt, but survivors are way too proud and some killers blame the community  way too much.
---
“New”
---
Someone mentioned Overheat being if the gen is worked on too long, that is interesting I think. Like every 40/30/20s of straight repair there is a really difficult skill check (Overcharge) and if it's failed it causes a huge regression like Pop Goes the Weasel and then can't work on it for 30/45/60s or something like that. Dunno if it would be good or not like that.
---
Tl;dr Sweet concept for a killer, I'm bad at perks.
---
Nurse has been OP at the highest skill levels for a while. End game is fine. It's real tough on solo survivors (though since killer hit 3k before gens, that's not unreasonable), but in all other cases, survivors decide the timing and positioning of it. It also has an anti-snowball mechanic with the slug pace timer if even one survivor is downed/hooked.
---
So, I didn't read the whole thing but I feel like alls ur saying is that since rank reset u have trouble finding people to chase/hit.
---
...I think you missed that I was adding on to what you already said. Unless I'm misunderstanding you, it sounds like you think I was disagreeing.
---
I KNOW DUDE
---
Why would you use the new penny? He’s garbage and cringe. Did a horrible act as a reboot and you should’ve made with old penny
---
That's kinda cringe bro
---
Listen here dick head. It’s: ruin, THphobia, monitor and abuse, nurses calling. Punishes people for healing, and punishes for not healing.
---
Hopefully not because that looks like shit
---
Top tier bröther
---
Infinite T3 takes a while to build up, and without ruin you guys might've completed the generators too quickly.  Also the speed boost from noed is nice.
---
But it is super obnoxious and toxic waste of time and BP.
---
I'd rather be full blinded while I break the pallet. Then at least they have a chance to lose me instead of *click clicking*.
---
I play both sides and I'd rather a solid chase where I have to try over teabags and *click clicks*.
---
Well damnit all
---
Yes. Everyone is escaping, I'm not getting BBQ, brutality, or sacrifice points, they're not getting WGLF, altruism, or whatever you get for being in chases. No one is burning any offerings and they're playing like they don't want anyone to get BP or pips. Idk how to react.
---
Hex: ruin your bank account
---
I always say gg cause my name is salty and I feel like people expect me to complain
---
No thanks tbh

&gt; being white knights for the devs
---
you should see the actual dbd forums...
---
I am offended. I don't want my sweet Clem being anywhere near these damn killers, even if it is the most sympathetic one. The zombies are enough for her to deal with.
---
lol, it makes a great wallpaper. Ill probably do more :)
---
You forget the part where you have to do this 5 times with complete strangers
---
Anyone who pretends this shit is consistent is on the Koolaid, not even a courtesy totem counter or anything. Blind luck.

This kid probably 13 yr old edge lord that hasn’t seen the original. This bootleg version is horrible as the actor lacks the acting abilities to portray penny as someone of a horror film instead of a teenage comedy
---
I’ll never understand why ppl eat medium rare. Like, the shit still pink inside 🤢🤢
---
So what? It’s infinite
---
Just screams no talent
---
If the pecs look too good, the killer's eyes are probably right on them too. 👀
---
So, in the two years I've been playing this game:
---
1. Pallet numbers have been halved
---
2. DS got nerfed into uselessness
---
3. Metal of Man, much like Dead Hard, allows for only an extra few seconds of chase unless it's a good survivor against a bad killer
---
4. You're still getting flashlighted? How's your 10 hours of play been? Seriously, face a wall, drop the survivor, check for other survivors if you know or, if you suck that much, run Lightborn. There's a goddamn perk designed precisely for the people who can't avoid flashlights.
---
5. Oh no, instaheals that are one-use? However will you- NOED, Devour Hope, Tier 3 Myers, Redhead's Pinky Finger, Iridescent Axe Heads, Make Your Choice, Mori, chainsaws, etc. Seriously, how can you complain about single-use insta-heals while having access to infinite-use instadowns?
---
This is without getting started on the fact that the changes to exhaustion makes Dead Hard a once-per-chase use, that it's now easier than ever to keep track of survivors as they make even more noise when they drop, that half the killers (Nurse, Hillbilly, Leatherface, Legion, Doctor, Hag, Spirit) all have ways to counter pallets in their base powers.
---
And going back to your original complaint (Mettle of Man), again, half the killers have inbuilt workarounds (Pig, Leatherface, Hillbilly, Plague, Legion, Myers).
---
Now, I'm not sat here telling you killers are overpowered, and I'm not sitting here as a survivor main, but goddamn if you compare what used to be a heavily survivor-sided game to what it is today, you have nothing to complain about. I literally didn't pick up playing killer for the first year or so because it was too difficult for me, then changes came in and made it *way* easier.
---
yeah report those messages definitely a com ban maybe an account ban
---
And it doesn't even work with Father Campbell's Chapel. They should change the name.
---
I actually don't. Never did. Sometimes just want a chill game without dealing with try hard killers and campers.
---
Ehhh again even for infinite t3 Myers the speed boost is quite nice
---
So de rank
---
 
---
* *Platform:* EPC
---
* *Type of Bug:* Gameplay/Add-on glitch
---
* *Description:* Clown's Redheaded Pinky Finger causes exposed when you touch gas after you've been direct hit once. You're supposed to only be exposed when he directly hits you, but if he's done it once, any contact with gas afterwards causes exposed condition.
---
* *Screenshot / Video:* [Boring video my friend made about the glitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnj1CmyHwao&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
* *Steps to reproduce:* Clown with Redheaded Pinky Finger. No other add-on needed, was tested with others but it didn't change anything. Hit survivor directly once, then wait for exposed to end. Let survivor then walk into a gas cloud and hit them, they will instantly be downed.
---
* *Expected result:* Survivors should only be exposed on direct hit, walking into a gas cloud or a non-direct hit should lead to the hit only injuring.
---
* *Actual result:* Survivor instantly downed when exposed to non-direct gas and then hit.
---
* *Reproduction rate:* 100%
---
That would be op af. I think it should be how he said it, but instead of not being able to interact with it, their auras are shown to the killer for 10/15/20 seconds.
---
So many things wrong with what you say first off this is a reboot this is a different version where it takes place during a new time period, second off I’m not a edge lord cause those people are cringe and annoying and third off the Tim Curry Pennywise was wacky and in my opinion cringe.
---
He’s there just invisible
---
You can bet your ass I wouldn't even play anymore lol. I disconnect all the time. I'm sorry but if you catch me once and sit there on the hook staring at me I don't really feel like you deserve a kill(Ill let you look into my eyes while my buddies do generators though) Like yea you worked sooo hard for that kill there buddy. Run Legion with sloppy butcher? Goodbye. 
---
I've been playing less and less already as it is. They do something like this and I'll just stick to Friday the 13th full time until that Predator game comes out.
---
I hate when my teammates disconnect over nothing but I hate garbage killers even more.
---
Pompous disagreement
---
Not while stunned but while breaking the pallet. If you time it right they will still be blinded for a second or two after they break the pallet and that should give you enough time to confuse them and make more distance
---
Imagine deadass complaining about a C tier killer *at best*
---
feng min is feral baby
---
Huntress: Together we are strong (same as Zarya in Overwatch actually)
---
Doctor: I see you

No clue what the Wraith says,

https://i.redd.it/ctgvkfmq5hv21.png Yup, I had a Nea in the same outfit do the same thing, so I watched her bleed out.
---
Someone just dced in my match when it was bubba boi
---
Thank god im not the only one
---
Reminds me of the same meme but with the flashlight Claudette on the bottom, anyone still have that one?
---
But if he can tap the power to get them into the transition then immediately pull them off that seems a bit op. Adding a bit of a delay in between would be fair
---
&gt;MoM is not any more stupid than Leatherface being able to down up to 4 full health players, in one hit &amp; at the same time.
---
Except for that to happen, Leatherface requires 4 brainless survivors who won't split up as soon as they see him.
---
MoM requires nothing.
---
Its 5 secs. There is a delay
---
Same anytime in the match there's a bubba's there's going to be people dc-ing.
---
*get camped*
---
Me: Run! I'll go sacrifice myself for you!
---
*3% self unhook*
---
*Me and killer stare at each other*
---
It’s frustrating because I’m very close to platinum but I can’t seem to get that trophy 🏆 I just want it done with Man U feel
---
Some stupid ones I came up with: 
---
Proximity camp for maximum slappage &gt; Hex: Devour Hope 
---
Where’d they go— wait I found them &gt; Deerstalker 
---
Please break my totem &gt; Hex: Haunted Ground
---
Fuck you and your slugging &gt; Unbreakable 
---
Please I’m doing a daily &gt; Cypress mori
---
Oh fuck what if it’s the hag &gt; any reagent
---
not today camper &gt; borrowed time
---
&gt;The counter is the aura reading which is a red flag you should probably kill that person first since a lot of killers approve of tunneling/camping as a “viable strat”
---
This is not a counter because more often than not, the killer will continue to chase that person after he got protected by MoM. This will obviously lead to him being downed which automatically removes the downside of MoM. For those that don't know, MoM only reveals your aura if you heal after being protected by it and before being downed after the protection. 
---
If the killer decides to drop chase, you can still 99% your heal in order to play around the aura reveal. 
---
Basically MoM has no downside and a huge advantage.
---
Yeah it's very frustrating. This update really gave the killers the upper hand.
---
They used to be each other, in the Alpha. Claudette was white, meg was black.
---
i played yesterday at rank 17 and let me tell you the amount of people rushing at noed without finding the totem is absurd
---
Also i get shat on for escaping. Uh, no thanks, i'd like to keep my pip thanks very much.
---
Your argument was invalid the second you said Friday the 13th. Terrible game.
---
Bubba is a great killer. Such a special boy.
---
And in the qa Video they will say work as intended :D

---
He's the killer I love going against the most.
---
Majority of killers that play him are idiots that respect every pallet so it's very easy to just run them for a long time. It's even more satisfying if they get so angry they face camp you.
---
Even if the dude is the worst player in the game PMing someone to tell them to delete their game and kill themselves is just incredibly toxic
---
Susie's fingers look like cubes on the end
---
ive never felt like i had the advantage as killer in endgame collapse. sometimes it feels worse than before cause pre patch if i kept em at 5 or 4 gens the last guy couldnt even get out via hatch so i could just figure it out with whispers. now i have to get to the hatch every time and even if i close it the exit gates are like light years apart from each other so if im not nurse billy or spirit maybe its literally a free escape
---
Cannibal is my favorite killer to go against, tbh.
---
Yeah, I don't even bother against 3-gen docs anymore. I just try to get as many points as I can and kill myself on hook to go to the next match. I don't have 20 minutes to watch some doc Overcharge kick the same gen 6 times in 2 minutes just to finally get the gens done and he has noed too. Boring, next game please. If they slug too, I just dc, no time for that shit
---
Я в этом шарю, something like, "Watch me do this" or "I'm doing this!". It's from the Russian version of the Sneaky Tom meme ([Ребята, я в этом шарю](https://memepedia.ru/rebyata-ya-v-etom-sharu/)).
---
Teabaging= toxic. Teabagging also= how survivors greet each other.
---
Pointing= fucking pointless.
---
It's a running gag since Claudette especially at prestige 3 is extremely hard to see it gives her a "cloak" ability
---
I agree
---
Yeah. That shit is funny
---
I remember it being lery's and we spawnd near the gate and i walk in immediately scream and had to fight the urge to DC. I ended up escaping bu hatch but that game put me at my limit of annoying gameplay.
---
I was expecting Rob Zombie
---
I think Empathy + Spine Chill is the better combo, imho.
---
You see when they're hurt, and know the killer is with them, plus spine chill takes care of the killer approaching.
---
Bond seems superfluous to me.
---
&gt;Claudette not doing gens while noob looped pig for like 20 minutes
---
Oh, I was there and watched it too. It was epic.
---
honestly i wouldn't blame you if you left me in that case id have left my ass too XD
---
&gt;Wrong. MoM requires 3 stacks from hits for a single use.
---
Which is part of playing survivor... You get stacks simply by existing in the trial. Unless you get grabbed or something.
---
Cannibal is no where near as bad.
---
Less than worthless!
---
Bill aint did nothing wrong
---
my friends always ask why i say gg even if i die. its cause im nice c: &lt;3
---
NOEDucation lol I love it
---
This guy sounds maybe a little bit too strong. Moving only 2% slower for a stealth mode is a bit much, especially because he can attack right out of it, with added detection ability for survivors.
---
Because game is bugged and you will not depip when DC, so currently there are no punishment. Yes, when you DC you will see in interface that you got depipped, but after you play a game your pips will come back.
---
OK, sorry that I couldn't peak your interest today I thought I would just offer everyone a chance to see a new persons gameplay and have a chat about whatever we want to talk about. I hope you have a good day and hope you find something that will peak your interest :)
---
Are you smurfing?
---
Thanks Fam &lt;3
---
I mean yeah survivors can be dicks but killers can too. Every play as a survivor and the killer shakes their head yes/no when downing or hooking u. Or even getting hooked only to get slapped 2-4 times. Then there's pig who will down u and that ur head. Then there's killers who will do a 360 or two at a hook before hooking u. 
---
Moral of the story is both sides are toxic and sadly it's become a normal thing to see in this game. Survivors should just leave through the gate when everyone lived and throw the pallet down without t-bagging/flashlight clicking. And killers should just down and hook without taunting.
---
Xbox DBD is a very toxic place for a killer main. My main got utterly pounded with negative reviews to the point I couldn’t use game chat in other games. These damned SWF streamers
---
Dead hard is so overrated.
---
That fucking sucks to hear to hear bro
---
It really do be like that
---
You right. I guess 110% would be better, especially since the fog is meant to give away his position.
---
This may be a foreign concept if you have some sort of advanced tunnel vision or wear horse blinders, but face cams are on the screen.  You can’t just not see part of the screen.  Unsure where the creep part plays in to it.  Either way, you don’t use a face cam if you don’t want to be looked at.

Good way for killers to body block survivors to force them to DC
---
So two meme perks
---
Nice
---
I like the Freddy rework
---
I'm the purist killer main that exists, but if they do anything to the corn I'll throw a bitch fit. It's literally the only cool thing for the Coldwind farm maps, and it makes me feel like a bad bitch when I snip someone in it as Huntress
---
I always the the luck of being the first survivor to get smacked and find out if they got noed. And half the time this is my first hook. And my teammates instantly leave ans not bother to even take a look for noed. Sucks but I understand.

I wana see a video of this happening

Sort of. Leatherboi's the kind of killer one would play when they want to turn their brain off for a few seconds and just mow down survivors. However, I don't consider him the hardest one to go against. If anything, I find Bubba's long-lost cousin Billy to be far more toxic and harder to counter than him.
---
Even with a basement build monstrous shrine isn't even worth the perk slot. A better pick would be bbq since going downstairs gives an extra few meters for it to pick up on survivors. Or make your choice. Or even devour hope.
---
I also don't like noed. That's another perk that is just straight up badly designed.
---
I discovered it, verifying my files fixed it because the cause of the issue was I installed that “mod” a lot of people have to make my icons look really cool, guess I’ll have to live without them
---
Tbh I think perks/items/add-ons makes a player. In order to prove who was the best in the match all 5 players would need to have no loadouts. Everything blank. Then u could see who has skill and who doesn't. I feel like calling a killer or calling a survivor trash because u have add ons or perks that give u an advantage has nothing to do with skill.
---
“jUsT rUN sMaLl gAmE”

Meanwhile while I’m playing solo my chucklefuck teammates all die and get basement hooked
---
Real fuckin nice perk, small game. Helps bunches.
---
Yeah, because what an experienced Pig player wants to do is crouch and charge dash at every loop so they can 50/50 a hit or a pallet to the face. A good survivor will just keep running the second you are crouch blinded. Not to mention you don't know who is running MoM and who isn't.
---
Is this actually gonna be in the game? Like this exact costume?
---
Always feels good to play Hillbilly, Chainsaw to the farthest generator, find someone and introduce them to my little friend and then have them D/C before they even hit the ground haha. 
---
Makes me feel bad for the remaining survivors in the game, I always feel like carrying the last one to the hatch as a "Sorry about that!"

Odd considering your post is so clearly one sided.
---
Set your profile to private, unfortunately mate it's common across all platforms.

Hard not to get tilted with the bullshit behaviour of some people. Honestly i feel your pain it's awful to see and have to put up with, and i'm a survivor main.
---
Look up no0b3 bud try being more original
---
Yeah, Hag has so much fun on corn, I forgot :).
---
We got a salty whiner over here everyone, surprised you didn't get downvoted like the other whiner that said this dumb shit. So you just say fuck the other 3 survivors in the game with you cuz "Boo hoo the killer is mean to me."
---
"Shut up and kiss me, you sexy noob!"
---
Sex me baby killer.
---
&gt; what you wrote here just doesn't really apply at high rank.
---
From the 14th to the 12th of each month for the last 18 months I've not seen double figure ranks, and if I'm having a busy month I'm in red ranks first weekend after reset. As much as I hate that it is, this game is pretty much all I play now. I play it often enough I haven't paid for any DLC that's available with shards, but all my characters are unlocked and to at least level 50, most prestiged. I'm saying this *as* someone who knows how to cut off loops, *as* someone who has seen how rarely people properly use MoM, *as* someone who uses my chainsaw properly, *as* someone who can avoid SWF flashlights. If you don't know how to play killer, of course you'll find the survivor's skills annoying, but if you can't do that basic stuff, you're not at rank 1. If you're the kind of person whose game can be ruined by someone running a perk that lets them take one more hit, you're probably not even rank 10. Sure, it takes longer when they have those perks, but that's just extra bloodpoints. Everything a survivor can do has a counter, not using that counter is not the survivor having an advantage. That's like sitting and complaining your neighbour got to work quicker on his bike while you ignored the car parked in your driveway and walked.
---
PS: DS is not "personal borrowed time". Borrowed Time when you take the hit you get a speed boost while the killer cleans their weapon, and no negative effect while still in their terror radius. DS you go down and then get a headstart running at regular speed. DS is a one-use perk, Borrowed Time is infinite use. DS requires you to hit a skill check, Borrowed Time is automatic.
---
Put some time into a killer, get to know their strengths, their weaknesses, maybe watch one of the youtubers or streamers playing a bit and see what you're doing wrong, know how to adapt when a player is running a particular perk. Failing that, there's always Civ.

Take a break if you feel like it. If you want to play again, do so but maybe not with the Intention to win and just play for fun. Really, some People including myself, take this game way too seriously and you wont be so frustrated when you just focus on having fun instead of winning. Also its Rank reset so you can play the craziest builds (i really recommend scratched mirror myers)
---
And waste items, bloodpoints, and your own time
---
Why hit the hooked guy? To tilt them? Also i had no idea u can't double pip if u leave injured as survivor :O Is this true? can someone else confirm too?
---
&gt; So two meme perks
---
If every hex in the entire game isn't worth even one perk slot combined, you don't get to complain about hexes.
---
Either you're bad at DbD and refuse to get better, or you secretly believe NOED isn't powerful and worth even 1/4 of your perks.
---
Ye. To tilt them. Also, leaving while injured affects your Unbroken badge.
---
I love her!
---
Or maybe I just want a bullshit frustrating perk to be properly balanced and not reward ass players. 
---
But sure, act pissy about it.
---
You seem like one toxic butthole
---
&gt; This thread is full of stupid.
---
Yeah, and you're the one providing it.
---
Yeah but if there's 4 people, and I get 3 or 4 out of 5 totems, and NOED still activates, that means i'm the only person who does totems
---
&gt;I remember when people played games for fun and didn't feel like they were personally slighted because of a bug that affects virtual currency in one specific scenario.
---
Nobody's acting like they're personally slighted. This bug is directly inhibiting peoples' ability to gain currency (in an astonishingly grindy game, no less) and rank; they have every right to be upset by this. This has literally nothing to do with "not playing the game for fun".
---
I think its intended for the devs to put out a strong perk so people are buying ash. It could use some buffs tho.
---
I played michael with addons that gave me tier 3 as quick as possible with mori and rank reset and they said gg even though they got 4k’d them with the mori respect gained
---
What? I think people just like the game doesn't matter what sexuality they are they just like it and just so happens alot of LGBT people like it.
---
I get that, I just see a lot of people from the drag community especially, and I was just wondering.
---
Pussy
---
I've found that a lot of LGBT folks, myself included were typically in the "Nerd Kid" groups in school, a common trait of those groups is a liking of horror films and slashers and other nerdy things like Sci-Fi and anime, as DBD hits one of the big points for such a group it seems only fitting that LGBT folk were come to the game
---
Also have you SEEN the new Jake skin?
---
I had no idea, thanks for explaining. Also when I get hit while hooked I feel like I tilted the killer instead cuz he is bming :D I usually get facecamped when they hit me tho. I dont really tbag so I guess they just didnt like me looping.
---
I just feel we shouldn't bring up sexuality  in a subreddit about a horror game where you place people on meat hooks and sacrifice them to a spider god.
---
I like the concept of there being fake windows and pallets, everything else sounds way to op!
---
Lol a friend asked this in a discord server earlier today. Idfk I dont think there is anything about it that makes it more popular. I'm a bad judge tho cause everyone I play games with are gay so it's just normal for me.
---
ok
---
T-Bag? Disappointing
---
#*silent nodding intensifies*
---
Honestly I'm not sure. I've just always loved horror and am gay. My bf loves horror too. This game really just appeals to me. I can't explain exactly why. Maybe LGBT people are drawn to horror because it shows characters with strong willpower overcoming difficulties. Maybe we like knowing it's even possible to do that. Lol idk
---
Maybe NOED should be updated to vastly increase the EGC timer when it activates? Something like: "Endgame collapse timer is doubled while the No One Escapes Death Hex Totem is lit". It isn't exactly the nerf people have wanted to see for NOED, given that it's only a nerf in the wake of EGC, but I think it a decent compromise to give survivors extra time.
---
His scream scared me more than the Spirit just appearing **JESUS**
---
Idc lol
---
I’ve always pictured her with the Doctor tbh. I don’t know something about finding a cure for her skin problems. I was happy to see they got cosmetics together only further strengthening my hunch.
---
wtf Huntress? XD
---
This happens to me too on xbox. Although I get a fair amount of GG or giving tips on how to play better. But it is a mixed bag. Sorry this happens to you. I know it sucks.
---
I don't mind flashlights, that is until I got flashed and almost had a seizure.. So now I have to bring Franklin's and hope I can smack it out of their hands, no idea how else to counter it other than lobby dodge. :/ If it's a purple flashlight the game becomes unplayable for me as killer. Its not a good time, and I wish they'd lower the brightness a bit for people like me.
---
It helps slow down the game so they can keep survivors off gens.
---
I’m... really into Kingsmith (David/Quentin) and Jake/Dwight and Laurie/Kate. 
---
Laurie/Kate became a thing because when I would play with my friend, whenever we played those two we’d be super altruistic and just be like “hands off my girlfriend killer!!” and stupid “omw to unhook the gf”
---
&gt;It helps slow down the game so they can keep survivors off gens.
---
Only if you can't math, which alarmingly seems to be the majority of the community.
---
What did grandpa bill do to you
---
Dr. No Heals? What loadout is that?
---
Self care. Yikes.
---
What?
---
i wish i can give this an award.
---
I think it really depends on which killer youre playing.
---
I run it just to slow down the game not to necessarily be "good".  I know it sucks to go against with legion though. Especially if they're running ruin or another time waster. But on the other hand as annoying as it is, ultimately, it's a legitimate tactic.
---
&gt; since you only have 2 mins to find the totem, pull survivor from hook AND escape safely.
---
Oh darn. It's almost like you need to move quickly during EGC to get something done. What a draconic concept. You'll never see people 99%'ing a door before going back for a save, so it's just way too OP.
---
Seriously? You're not supposed to have a wide time frame once EGC is triggered. Do you expect the timer to slow down because you're out hunting for a totem and saving your friend? That's not how it works. The timer is already slowed when they're downed/hooked, so you do get *some* additional time, but it's gotta be one of the stupidest things I've ever heard to suggest that you should have longer because you're out doing something.
---
EGC is more than just people holding the game hostage by hiding and teabagging at exit gates. It represents a type of "ok the doors are open, so you better get out while you still have the chance or suffer the consequences" position. Why is that so difficult?
---
It takes all of my willpower not to DC against a Legion. They are so unbearably frustrating to play against.
---
That's actually a great idea.
---
Don'tcher remember the pirate code? Whoever *gets left behind* stays behind.
---
Did you play this before or after mid chapter? Because 1 blade was enough for infinite mending.
---
&gt;What?
---
People will heal against Legions because of Thanatophobia only if they can't math and think the red bar actually does anything to the gen progress speed.
---
They rather waste 20s healing or 40s self-healing instead of just accepting the additional 12s caused to a gen by a 4 stacks Thanatophobia. 
---
To make things worse, they do that multiple times.
---
1. Iridescent king and High Stim Electrode 
---
Perks: Distressing, Nurse’s Calling, Coulrophobia, and Sloppy Butcher
---
I mean it depends on how long the game lasts doesn't it? I know some people don't mind sticking around but if I get killed 3-4 minutes into the game i'm not going to spectate for 15 extra minutes to say gg.
---
I normally don't post such things and message people the way I did (I admit, some of what I said back was cringey and childish) but this guy absolutely baffled me. I was playing Spirit with prayer beads to get some easy points and two survivors disconnected early in the game after I downed them. This guy then messages me saying that I have no skill for playing Spirit with prayer beads and that I MUST be a killer main for having leveled up one killer in all my two years of playing this game lol. In my opinion, prayer beads isn't that bad at all and actually makes the game more interesting.
---
Yeah i said that i guess in simpler terms.
---
Nobody is saying that one perk is ruining the game. Nobody is saying that. The complaint is that MoM is just one more perk that wastes time and it does so for free.
---
Of course you play Billy. Of course you do. Just one more near sighted individual shortchanging the experiences of others because they don't have to deal with it. I like playing all the killers, for your information. For somebody who types so much discussion trying to look knowledgeable, do you really think omitting that you play a killer that basically makes the perk under discussion less relevant isn't relevant? Of course you're just mildly inconvenienced by MoM. Even if you've triggered it, you've already saved so much time looking for survivors with his mobility, so it doesn't bleed you. I can play Billy too! But here you are, clapping your asscheeks and telling me to study LOL.
---
P.S. Borrowed Time gives you a chance if you are tunneled. DS gives you a chance if you are tunneled.
---
 Both of you are acting like children- trying to piss off the other, baseless insults, dumb shit.
---
For the record, Spirit is NOT a skill-less killer to play. Why would someone even say that.
---
Yep.  If all the survivors don't try and help each other off the hook, I don't pip.  There is literally nothing I can do to pip if they choose not to help each other.
---
Don't do or suggest that, it's 100% useless and it is mind boggling how often I see people repeating it. 
---
Read-only simply means the game won't overwrite the ini file, it can't and doesn't force the game to use the settings. If any of the parameters are out of allowable ranges (which you cannot control by any means) it simply uses it's default setting for that line, it also only writes to the ini when you close the game which is further proof that read-only is useless and using guides or suggestions that suggest to set it should be a warning sign that they have no idea at all what they're talking about.
---
You can change vsync &amp; frameratelimit lines, save and use. 
---
Bonus tip: setting a huge limit is silly. You want to set a reasonable limit that your system can maintain all the time. Otherwise you'll have large fluctuations which are bad.
---
Why would someone call spine chill crutch its good for learning you dont need it? But i agree its a great perk.
---
I’d say good job, but it’s rude to be toxic to especially pig. C’mon man, I just did a slug Billy and bled everyone out and killed the last person with collapse, at least I have *some* dignity
---
No i've tested it it counters it
---
That’s sad. I’ll end up using the one that comes the the devil mask, but this looks amazing
---
That makes perfect sense for when you've had a full five to ten minute match where you completed five gens but doesn't work well in the games that the hatch is meant for. The hatch isn't there to let Blendettes get a free escape, it's there so that a player isn't AS punished by his teammates mistakes. NOED is very well balanced around a game where all the gens were done, but not so much against endgame caused by hatch closing. If you have a d/c 30 seconds in and everyone gets wiped then the killer doesn't really need NOED to catch you at a gate, since if you managed to open it while healthy you did a pretty impressive feat. And in those situations you simply don't have time to cleanse all 5 totems. I'm not suggesting it gets nerfed to hell, just that it triggers when the final gen is completed rather than when gates are powered like many of the other endgame perks. I know that it isn't a super common occurrence for NOED to kill the last survivor after the hatch is closed, but it's common enough and has so little counterplay that the devs should look into potential changes.
---
Dead hard isn't the best exhaustion perk, but it's easily the one that survivors do the worst job of using. Then they talk about it on reddit like the problem is the perk and not them.
---
Distinguished bastard gang 👉😎👉
---
Yeah man. Just go on profile and make it so only friends can send messages. I mean just kill them and ignore them. They'll get mad and get over it in 10 minutes.
---
I always go for the save if there's the slightest chance they can survive, even if I die in the process. NOED can kiss my ass.
---
I mean she was low tier before getting nerfed.

---
Horror genre has always been popular with Lgbt folks.
---
I admit, I was being completely childish and I usually never go this far but this guy just really annoyed me. No excuse of course but I've never encountered another player like him
---
The devs said that once you get the trap put on your head, the box that’ll have the right key is already determined, so no I don’t think it’s luck based. I usually can get the trap off my head unless I’m getting tunneled all game. Do you try to self care and then go look for the right box? Cause if so that might be what’s killing you, sometimes you don’t have enough time to heal unless you have a good med kit or a teammate has We’ll Make It or something like that.
---
Edit: also, I’m not really a killer main, but I’m pretty sure The Pig has ads ons that can make getting the trap off your head much more difficult. So her add ons probably play into it as well.
---
Wasn't aware it was popular with a particular community tbb
---
I’m sorry but you sound like an idiot posting this, and it has nothing to do with add ons either
---
Its whatever man. I dont even respond to people like that.
---
i'm not quite into shipping characters but all i can say is that i'm really into Jake x Myers, Ace x Tapp and David x Adam 'cause, for me, they look hella hot together
---
Yes and no. It's not a free powering on the door, they reworked the previously flawed mechanic to be a new mechanic that is a bit more balanced on both sides. The doors typically spawn so close together that any killer can patrol them both well enough that they never open, so if you have the door open while healthy then you've beaten the odds, NOED simply makes it impossible to open a door and escape unless you're extraordinarily lucky. And not every late perk is triggered by endgame collapse. Bitter murmur doesn't trigger because the gens aren't completed, and Rancor doesn't tell you where survivors are. I think the perk is well balanced for a typical game but should be activated when the final gen is complete so that a survivor still has a small chance of escaping if their teammates d/c'ed or suicided
---
It's extremely helpful against stealth killers for me
---
If they don'e, someone else will tell them to kill themselves. :(
---
This is the Huntress perspective she's always deserved.
---
Logical minded gamers: Brace yourselves, the white knights are coming...
---
You mad? Lol. If you think infinite tier 3 is OP then maybe you should get some of that skill you speak of.
---
Imo, if I’m going to rage quit(which I never do) it would be from the pig or legion. Bubba just makes me giggle when I play against him.
---
Just learn to fuckin do it like the rest of us
---
Lucky, I just got called illegal immigrant.
---
No need to swear.
---
Rank reset makes no sense to me, I can get lowering your rank if you haven't played for a while, but to just lower everyone's rank every month is dumb.
---
I think the point is it shouldn't be a set day a month, but instead a progressive regression. Of course if you haven't played in years you shouldn't keep rank 1, but people that do still play everyday and don't derank from rank 1 eith the existing de-pipping system shouldn't be matched with lower rank/skilled players since both groups won't enjoy their experience.
---
Lol you dont deserve to moonwalk if you cant do it manually
---
Damn😂😂huntress looking fine !!!
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, this is all true. I'm a fan of Noob myself but sometimes he's a dick for no real reason. he typically notices pretty quick and fixes it before he does anything super rude but sometimes he doesn't. It kinda pissed me off when he started playing on an old account because he was bored of high ranks and was just laughing at all the killers in rank 20. He was ruining the first experiences of new players and having a blast with it. but he didn't do it maliciously, he just didn't think it through.
---
When I first joined to fandom I noticed that David and Jake are the communal town bikes. Jake more so than David since David seems to be shipped mostly with male characters whereas Jake has been shipped with both male and female characters. So while I shipped them I had no hope of the two getting paired up. 
---
So imagine my surprise when the devs basically just paired up those two in the recent promo images and even giving context of their closeness via Of Mice and Men comparison.
---
I also like the Wraith and Nurse thing they had going. Jeff is clearly into both Claudette and Kate as shown in the new promo image.
---
wait what
---
You don’t have to be elitist about something so small. r/gatekeeping as well
---
Its true. Look it up my dude.
---
I don’t even have an issue with Mettle Of Man. It has some form of counterplay depending on if you’re equipped for it. My only problem with it as killer is there’s really no downside to it. The aura reveal is mostly worthless for the strength it gives you and the free health state can really let you make greedy or stupid plays because free health state. 
---
What it really needs is one simple change. Show the aura of the survivor when Mettle Of Man is ‘active’ and for the rest of the game. The issue of MoM is that it only shows the aura after you’ve been fully healed after proccing it. If you go down, there’s been no downside to the perk. If it showed your aura after it was ready/for the rest of the game, there’s be much more threat to it being used to get out of jail cause the killer will always know where you are from then on. 
---
Honestly as survivor, I’d been running MoM, BT and just creepy saving other people because you can force killers who could circumnavigate the perk to hit you by body blocking too so even the 6-7 killers who can ease the perk still get forced hits in.
---
I definitely feel killers are more vicious towards me if I play as Meg compared to when I play as Kate.
---
He did some stupid stuff to get banned in the past and makes some interesting comments at times. I like watching him but not everyone here does, some people can't look past his hacking and don't like things like his attitude about de-ranking.
---
I second this. Also, feeling like you’re pulled from the normal world and into something much more mysterious like the Entity’s realm? That’s like coming out. And then we sit around the campfire and talk and do the bidding of the Entity—a large, gay spider god.
---
He streams too dude
---
What's a tier 1 Meyers?
---
Honestly it wouldn’t even feel bad if you deranked after such a game (which is likely to happen) since the satisfaction comes from denying them points, not from getting points yourself.
---
Lery’s with any amount of thicker mist: I’m about to end this man’s whole career.
---
I like to hold LEFT ARROW KEY on em
---
wtf are you talking about, DS was out here for over two years before it was nerfed
---
also, the vast majority of dlc perks are useless.  "devs make op dlc characters for sales" is the dumbest dog shit brain thing gamers say, i swear.
---
Why not? Are you sansphobic?
---
Good for them still shouldn't matter. I just don't want people saying stuff that involves genders and sexuality I just want to talk about the game not deal with anything controversial
---
I use it for opening the escape gates honestly
---
Same map, fighting over the same survivors, and the winning killer gets to mori the other.
---
I’m the one who is left behind
---
Wha?
---
Is that paulie esther?
---
I am chill just saying there shouldn't be any talk about something so damn political we should just play the damn and talk about. Also this fucking subreddit is made for people to talk about the game not sexuality or politics just the game.
---
Camping and tunneling is also part of the game then.
---
Dude, rarely anyone t bags back! Wtf
---
Hex names are my favorite wholesome dbd meme.
---
you can block incoming messages by setting your profile to private or you can mute specific convo's.
---
Funny how you need MoM to survive but still Tbag like you were so good
---
I'm just fucking sick of people saying oh this character is a trans rights activist or anti abortion supporter etc I just want to play a game to take me out of the real world not see people pushing their belief on both sides of the spectrum the second this game forces a character  to be something politically charged I'm dipping even though Bhvr wouldn't  do that as they have a good track record. Edit: I wrote this comment horribly I don't mind characters liking something just when it's forced and done poorly it annoys me.
---
basically the rework we all want that BHVR won't give
---
Well, it’s definitely not something I try to do with much animosity.
---
Most games I play as killer I’ll give someone hatch etc.
---
If I play badly and get teabagged for it, it can be upsetting, but I do my best to let it go and laugh it off.
---
However, if a group of survivors is bming a lot, and I feel like they might be the type to send me “baby killer” messages afterward, getting a couple kills with egc can be pretty satisfying. No, it’s not a thing I’m particularly proud of, but it can feel redeeming.
---
That said, I don’t ever send people salty or mean messages post-game. Any sort of “oh you THOUGHT but you’re GOING ON HOOK YOU FOOL” feelings are for the game itself.
---
Well that explains a lot
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
Guess we will know for certain when the chapter comes out. 
---
I trust his word so I won't get my hopes high for a survivor.
---
They are under NDA but he got caught up in the moment, thinking it would be alright to say everything about the chapter considered it was leaked.
---
Talking about a demographic within the game is relevant to guess what? THE GAME.
---
No it’s another guy that said that
---
I am almost 100% sure it wasn't broken after the update cause I still got a ton of points for my first gen each time up until like 2 days ago. Unless they released a hotfix 2 days ago and I didn't notice.
---
It’s been here, it’s a repost and a half
---
If your temps are going into high 80s and upward it's going to throttle down to keep the card from overheating. I play on ultra settings with a 2080 and i7 3770k for hours With gpu at 99% usage and cpu at 93%. I do have good cooling for both though. My old 680, however, would heat up (before I set a custom fan curve) and the game would freeze up for a few seconds in game...a lot.
---
Ayyyy
---
I agree I was being harsh and not understanding I'm just so fed up with politics and sexuality in games that I just snapped so I apologize it's just annoying seeing everyone push their belief which is why I was shutting everyone down without reason.
---
Not only that, it is also the horror of facing evil.
---
Quentin actually sounds hopeless when he finds out Freddy was and always had been a monster, that there was no revenge for a wrongdoing, and specially that he was not going to stop,  he was doing everything just because he was evil. and there was no way to convince him to stop.
---
Prayer Beads give you gen grabs and free hits, while Infinite EW3 Myers can be gen rushed and looped to hell.
---
None of them are OP on their own. Combining them all is though, and breaks the game.
---
I get so tired of all these imagined rules... If both sides just used the perks and stopped bitching that'd be great! To survivors, bring your good perks and addons. To killers, bring your good addons and perks. Nothing is considered crutch.. Its in the game to use. I like games that CHALLENGE me as killer, and I like games that CHALLENGE me as survivor. Just bring whatever the fuck you want,  I'll bring whatever the fuck I want. Play the game. And don't bitch if you lose... bunch of crybabies :/
---
If she was with anyone, I'd imagine it would be Billy. They both had shitty backstories, and are both disfigured. I could imagine them having empathy for each other and caring for each other.
---
And when is that?
---
I think someone confirmed that we get a new survivor and a new map with Ghost Face.
---
uwu thx fred
---
So u want to beat the legit world record for something that needs movement skill?
---
Just learn it urself, ive been moonwalking since oktober last year, my record isn 30 something seconds. I struggled for it.. it’d be kinda a cunt move to just macro a whole game, + the macro would only work for straight lines, no turning so would be ass anyways
---
Please give our sweet boy cosmetics uwu
---
Am I the only one that's really happy about rank reset because I dont think I deserve to be in red ranks?
---
I'm not red ranks good honestly, but just playing a few games every second day always makes me move up to red ranks and that's when queue times get long, people are tryharding and no one is interested in making the games enjoyable for both sides anymore.
---
I wish ranking up was even harder.
---
I'm not centrist at all I'm very conservative it's just I don't want people talking about it in video games that's why I was trying to be centrist I guess but it made me sound like a dick instead of being reasonable. Plus arguing politics on the internet is kinda worthless as it changes nothing and make people angry
---
Just standing there taunting
---
As a gay man who has played this game for nearly two years now, I don’t know. I think I just like DbD because of the gameplay aspect of it, not necessarily anything related to my sexuality (except for Evan, of course).
---
No one was pushing anything dude, people were talking how/why the game was popular with the lgbtq+ community. Talking about people who play this game is not political nor anything. Its just that, discussing demographics.
---
Much like talking about how toxic the community is.
---
Ikr! Like the optimization kinda helped, but the corn is terrible now.
---
As a Nurse main, I usually get 1 kill on that one Cornfield map that has corn all over the place. Otherwise, 4k is the normal outcome.
---
[Here it is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bnb9fu/ever_had_the_entity_get_the_4k_for_you/)
---
Watch Pain Killers video on all the uses you get out of Spine Chill. Things like juking the nurse amd mindgames in looping.
---
one time a nea told said she was bringing bloody party streamers and told us all to bring it too. she brought an escape cake.
---
the match starts and i spawn next to a hex totem, pop it, it’s haunted grounds, nea gets insta downed right after. haunted grounds is up and i haven’t seen spirit, so you know a bitch isn’t gonna get off this gen to save the nea who bamboozled all of us.
---
she reaches tier 2, gets saved, and instantly farmed and gets 2k points at the end of the match. karma’s a bitch, nea
---
I went against a billy on Rotten Fields that had Discordance, TotH and Devour Hope. His TotH was cleansed on the other side of the map just as I cleansed his Devour Hope, then he DCed
---
I'm not 100% sure since I wasn't paying much attention but I'm pretty sure BHVR called it a chapter when they acknowledged it instead of a paragraph. If it's a chapter then that means a map and survivor are part of the package.
---
You dont lose two pips actually, next time you restart your game it gives the 2 lost pips it said it took back to you.
---
It's just a free hit as a reward for being hit multiple times. It's absurd. I pointed out the other day that the only reliable counterplay is tunneling, and I was downloaded. But people will see soon enough. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bn500c/the_only_viable_counterplay_to_mettle_of_man_is/

Ik and that's why i apologize I snapped it's just anything with LGBT on the title turns into a shitshow and shows our nasty side that's why I feel like it's unfit for this sub as It makes everything turn trash instead of being understanding like this thread
---
I think you're looking for [this](https://imgur.com/a/fx4xols)
---
Same with the map full of corn, it's really annoying
---
&gt;hold space
---
Nice.
---
Despite this tier list, I get spared quite a bit as Quentin, lol
---
I mean Toxic, Tunneling, Gen rush, Sweaty, Camping have different meaning for different people. Personally, I think the game sets some good in game references for a few of them that I use to avoid being “toxic”. Tunneling for me is downing a survivor within 60s off hook (DS timer). Camping is being within 24m of hook (Devour Hope).
---
Yeah I'm with you on this. While it sucks to die or get no kills, if you lose the game you lose. Learn from it and evolve. Like there were times I died multiple games in a row and I'm just like, "Yeah I fucked up."
---
Autodidact is actually pretty fun to use though
---
You can counter all 4 of them making them useless.
---
Dwight, David, Nea, and Kate. That's what.
---
I feel this would be much funnier if I knew who that was. I assume a YouTuber?
---
Don't look for the hatch, as soon as you know hatch is coming (last guy is one his way to the hook), go straight to an exit door.  As soon as killer kicks the hatch, start opening.  You've got a 50/50 shot that they go to the wrong door.  If it's not Billy, you'll have time to open it and get away. 
---
  
---
You already lost.  Killers work to get 3-4 kills and you shouldn't have an easy out just because you managed to be the last one standing up.  Half the time, the last one alive is some jackass who hid from tr all game long and probably did &lt;1 Gen.  Killers work to close out a game, you need to work a little to get to be the sole survivor instead of the last victim.  The endgame situation is currently the most fair that it's ever been.
---
Unrelates to dbd but this post reminded me of 
---
Toxic player: "Go fuck yourself"
---
Response: "No, go fuck me yourself you coward"
---
It was pointed out to me that they also referred to Ash as a "chapter" on Twitter, so that may not mean much.
---
Yeah as I ranked up I noticed my noed was useless cause they would get rid of all the totems
---
Afaik he streams on twitch and has a YouTube channel
---
Yeah
---
I want them to fully support them. If they allowed us to change the backgrounds themselves we’d get much better quality. We’d also be able to actually edit offerings and all this would require less work. Probably won’t happen tho
---
"reward ass players"
---
Meanwhile, the entire SWF coms squad has adrenaline, dead hard, MoM and Decisive/borrowed time to remove any consequences of risky play at the end. But no one wants to use small game.
---
Wow dude, first off, first day running no mither, super fun, I like it :)
---
Also, the heals are nutty, it’s almost instant hahahaha. Was really fun and one dude messaged me thinking I was hacking lol. I don’t know how much I will play of this in the future, maybe I’ll try something slightly different, but I really did enjoy being the team healer :D

Ty for the build fam!

If only it didnt take so long for me ta think of it

I learned Killer on Mikey. It taught me how to be sneaky when approaching survivors, balancing risk/reward between using a 1-shot (T3) or just m1, learning that I prefer stealthy builds (Scratched Mirror) but do fancy the OP tombstone (piece). And let’s be real, having John carpenter’s soundtrack is really nice compared to default music. I’ve since moved on to Hag/Spirit but I still come back to Micheal every now and then. Good killer to start with (or main)
---
You have a killer designed to keep as many people injured as possible as often as possible, and we're going to bitch about that killer using perks designed to work off people being injured? 
---
Maybe killers should all be required to choose mouse OR keyboard, but not both, right?
---
Step 1. Use ruin. BBQ will also help you find them.
---
Step 2. Run any other killer, be OK with sucking at first. It’s fine and probably necessary until you can “git gud,” as the kids say.
---
Step 3. Disregard pallets. Good survs will loop for days. Gotta swing thru em and be OK eating a few. Play with timing to mind game them. Put in Enduring if stun times bother you. KNOW WHEN TO LEAVE if a surv is too good at looping and kills too much time.
---
Step 4. Add ons are key. Billy gets much easier when chainsaw charge is less and steering is better. Bubba needs less charge and longer chainsaw duration. Myers benefits a lot from stuff that helps gain evil faster or EW3 last longer. Etc etc.
---
Lastly, think strategically. Frequent passes by Ruin totem. When to hook vs when to slug. Remember which survivors are working on what gens - they’re liable to go back if it’s far enough along. Aim for a 3 gen cluster at the end you can easily patrol, it really drags endgame out.
---
It’s not that hard, just takes practice. I average probably a 3K with Trappy boi and Myers is almost always a 4K.
---
I wish people could play with taunting people. Like they tea bag and use BM like they are so good. This is dbd I play it. I know you had matches where you got totally trashed hundreds of time. That crap is just so they can act superior but for what purpose?
---
They need to change the dreaming and transition mechanic as a whole. It makes Freddy weak because it makes it difficult to down survivors, and it's annoying for survivors as a whole.
---
Make all Freddy games in the dream world the entire time, give him ways to be in multiple places at once or move quickly throughout the map or alter the environment in small ways to confuse and turn survivors around.
---
Yeah it seems like if they were going to come to console they would have already. It's a damn shame. Just with 1 of those packs we could improve the look so much.
---
That's a mock up and won't be possible in the game.
---
The hatch shouldn’t exist in the first place. Do you know the only reason it’s here? Because when there was one survivor left with multiple gens to do, they would stealth around and try to fix those gens while killer has to walk around the map and patrol all the generators, hopefully finding the last guy.
---
You're right. I guess prayer beads is a bit OP in it's own sense as with many other add-ons can be with different killers. I'm moreso just basing it on my experience with games I've had as a survivor which may be the wrong thing to do. Most of the time I've seen people still mess with and loop a Spirit even if she has prayer beads. But maybe I haven't run into many good Spirits. 
---
Reading other people's comments on my post made me realize that I was just being really childish and it doesn't help that the friends I play with encourage me to say things I don't normally say. I've since messaged the player and we both apologized to each other and ended on good terms. :)
---
When people actually upvote, this makes me happy that strangers are so supportive, we need more of this.
---
That makes sense if he stole there book to keep tabs. Could also be his book of addresses that list all the people hes stalking.
---
Why wouldnt i flashlight someone after breaking a pallet to try and outplay?! Are you Killer Mains OK?
---
Ooooo that's tasty.
---
Courtesy totem counter.
---
In a game that's supposed to be survival horror.
---
Do you just want it to be handed to you, or would you like to be responsible for putting out at least a few iotas of effort?
---
Man you must play at R15 then lol
---
This is no time for rational responses.
---
You stepped into her and tried to dodge. Don’t lie to me.
---
Yeah I hear you. The best you can probably do is just go play some rounds with new killers and focus on improving rather than results.
---
You could always run ToTH if you want a warning for your totems, but then you won’t know which totem is which hex. But definitely want to be running Ruin if you biggest problem is the game progressing too fast.
---
Sounds like you got the right idea with pallets. Both Enduring and Spirit Fury are options.
---
Most of all just enjoy branching out. Personally I main Myers because I just love his abilities and that EW3 lunge is insane. But I also really enjoy Trapper and Clown just for shits and giggles. Find what you like!
---
Yeah. Just do it
---
Do you not see my deliverance? I wanted to be toxic lmao and I had MOM and dc I wanted to make the killer salty
---
Yeah, while they can kill you, the main point of the trap is to waste the survivors time.
---
Yea i wish I could switch wiggle to R3 and L3
---
This example was clearly lag but now i'm going to be paranoid about SWFs doing this intentionally to cause killers to depip
---
Yeah I’ve never liked abilities that were more passive like his were where you get them to tier 3 and it helps you in the background unless I learned how to pallet block or window block with his shock I’d rather play billy atleast recently I’ve had fun playing billy
---
Yeah but Ghostface was in a very unfinished state. Sounds same as Myers for actually stalking, ability icon same as Myers, other 2 teachables completely missing (and his "finished" one doesn't even have flavor text or a perk icon) etc. so maybe they didn't get to that part yet.
---
I went back to rank 15 as killer and wanted a relaxing match... Nope! I had to sweat lmao. Oh well... it'll be over soon..
---
Exactly. They can avoid healing in the terror radius, cleanse all the totems, hide in lockers for a moment whenever someone gets picked up and power through/cleanse ruin. They also should expect every killer to have those.
---
Why would you choose to be trapper main?
---
Everyone has preferences.
---
That is what Killers get after crying so much about DS :)
---
DS was a missable hard Skillcheck that gave 2 extra seconds on 90% of the survivors.
---
Mettle is an auto win no skill just hits required. If you smart u collect those outside of chase on Hook blocks 2.
---
You picked your poison maybe it is a lesson to not cry about every strong  survivor perk thats only "OP" because the majority of killers have troubles pressing the w button.
---
Would you call that “giving a win” then? You really are something else
---
I will admit that I forgot to include killers who dc immediately when they get looped or get maps or maps they don't like, but 90% the dcs I get are from survivors which usually ends up screwing over the whole team
---
Take a look at their perks survivors are using, if they have MoM/Dead Hard/Adrenaline etc it probably means they played this game a lot but took a break (so don’t feel bad about losing to experienced players). The closer you get to Rank 1, the more important it becomes to have a perk like Ruin (there is a reason it is commonly used). I would also maybe learn how to run certain tiles better (Scott Junds vid on YouTube is a great starting point). Lastly, you won’t get good at one side unless you play the other. Play some survivor, see how you would react during certain loops, where you would hide if a killer was coming, etc. and it will help you play against them better.
---
It was a joke lmao wow your so ignorant
---
YES. Thank you. Both of these would be easy fixes to a problem that should be obvious. I can't fathom how anyone thinks that it's fair for the hatch to be permanently closed only to be opened by a pretty rare item that can also be knocked from you leaving only the gates are escape routes. With a ticking timer. So it's not like you can take your time sneaking around the killer to open one gate.
---
Bro, am not going to lie, I felt like such a troll running this LOL. It felt so clunky, but so damn trolly. I ended up playing 4 games with it as I wanted to make some annoying plays with it lol. 
---
I had no luck on Unbreakable, but I did wiggle out a couple of times. Also, on one map (I forget the name), in the corner I could keep wiggling out and running back to the corner. I don’t know if it’s due to the build or what, but it was funny lol
---
I don’t think I’ll run this in the future, but was def funny my dude, ty fam
---
Its happened with me one time, a survival just opened the exit gate and as soon as the gate opened i blink and grabbed him/her
---
If a day or two I’ll upload something there
---
You can change everything else tho
---
Self care usefull but def not meta anymore
---
Can you learn how to reply in a chain instead of making those one-offs lol? And yes, I am. Playing killers is stressful enough already and they don’t need to be BMed like that
---
Lame.
---
Lol I could go on with how useless some Survivors are but honestly, just farm them and go to your next game, you'll rank up away from these idiots and you'll have a better time.
---
I play like a mid-high Surv and Rank 1 Killer and let me tell you after this rank reset I am telling you there is a 100% clear disparity between the survivors I have in my games at high ranks compared to the ones are low tank, too altruistic, too... "MUST GET RUIN OR CAN'T DO GENS" kinds of people.
---
I could go on but all I will say about Killers and Survivors in how they fare within the game but I won't, people won't get it and swing too far on one side to even get it.
---
Yeah, good Spirits never get looped, no matter If they have Prayer Beads or not.
---
Do people actually waste time watching this crap? 
---
The killer is still a month away. A hundred things can change until then and that is before PTB even happens, which will lead to more changes and tweaks.
---
LOUD = FUNNY
---
But they did finish his cosmetics which is kinda odd I mean if they have different teams on outfits and stuff which I'm assuming. we also got ash as a survivor which means they could be doing a leatherface and make him a lone killer idk evidence goes both ways.
---
Just thought I shared it anyway cause I didn't understand what was even happening when the gameplay was reveal, like I thought he was like Michael and you had to stalk for 10-20 secs, but knowing it's 2-4 secs on one survivor clears it up.
---
I am biased because I main her.
---
i just love the thought of michael in the distance stalking you, frozen in that pose. hands on hips. smirkin.
---
I admire the stealth lord Neas. I find their toxicity funny too.
---
my favorite are the ones that rev up the chainsaw at every pallet even if youve still got 15 feet of distance
---
The Claudette in "Don't Like" is actually Jane. Her face wasn't available on the website.
---
I don't care what game I'm in now I just do gens until I'm last man standing, because once someone gets hooked I know everyone else will either crouch in a corner and do nothing, or slowly go for save and get downed and the cycle repeats, no one does gens if there's ruin, no one does gens once someone is hooked, so I better stick to gens no matter the cost.
---
only problem is if he brings insidious
---
He's gross!!!!!!!
---
You haven't faced me then.
---
Doesnt work in FH.
---
if you wiggle, the bar will keep filling up
---
I forgot about Ash when making it. He would be "Ok".
---
Eyes in the darkness and dark assassin are way too op. Seeing aura infinitely is definitely game breaking and would encourage tunnelling, and no cool down means literally death for people
---
Just looking proud of the survivors for doing a gen instead of urban evasioning to a bush. This really is a Kodak moment for him.
---
the killer is better than a survivor 1v1 but put up against 3 or 4 it becomes way more balanced, and if a team really works together they can win most of the time
---
&gt;Just thought I shared it anyway cause I didn't understand what was even happening when the gameplay was reveal, like I thought he was like Michael and you had to stalk for 10-20 secs, but knowing it's 2-4 secs on one survivor clears it up.
---
The killer hasn't been released! How do you expect to understand anything? 
---
Wait until the final version and then start wondering how he works.
---
You're probably right on that. I just remember it's right after one DC and it's pretty long
---
You want get banned for a bad game. Or at least I never have. You can recieve a ban for threats on most platforms however.
---
Well it depends really.
---
Self Care might not be a good option if you have to save people with the killer near them regularly.
---
You'll probably wind up dying because the game wants you to heal right next to the hooked guy.
---
My build would have two versions. The Selfless Healer, and the Selfish Point Whore.
---
Selfless Healer: Borrowed Time, We're Gonna Live Forever, We'll Make It and Botany Knowledge/Auto-Didact.
---
Selfish Point Whore: Borrowed Time, We're Gonna Live Forever, Deliverance and any 4th perk that helps you personally. Like MoM, DS, BL or DH. Whichever you use the most
---
It costs exactly $0.00 to not be a shithead.
---
I literally just got tunneled the last two games too, it's really pathetic.. I go out of my way to not tunnel on killer and wish others would do the same.
---
Yeah. Tunneling as in someone gets off and its passed 1 minute it's fair game. Anytime before that and you are kinda stopping someone from being able to play. It's not fun for anyone to derank because the killer cant get a new target so they go after what's easy. I do get survivors will return to the same gen but if you kick it and you dont look around then that's on the killer. Most of the time I'm 2 feet from the killer when it happens and they dont even bother searching. The ones that do bother with it usually find me easily and it really nips it in the bud.
---
I can't unsee it now FUCK
---
They just want the easy hook. I'm not trying to derank because of it though. It's ridiculous that you cant control if you are hard tunneled then you derank and stay in the fifth because of it.
---
I do it when killer has played fair
---
I think iit was a salty swf, but i hope they get banned, for the death theats. I know its probably just 12 year olds who wont do anything but the fact people say stuff like that over a game is pathetic
---
okay but this is the funniest shit I've seen in days
---
I'm pretty much almost back at rank 14 because of being hard tunneled lol, it almost feels like double BP again :p
---
There’s only about 8 killer perks worth using.
---
This looks awesome, Is there a full Perk colored pack too anyone xd?
---
No probs man, I only really ran the build to try and get the Wounded Healer trophy. Didn't actually think you'd follow up on it lol. Playing the team healer's heaps fun.
---
Just part of gaming and online communication in general. People dont care what they do or say online unless it has a direct impact on thier physical life.
---
If it helps you will always have more good games then bad ones.
---
&gt; I do anyways because I'm leveling him up for bbq
---
You can play other killers and put BPs into LF. That works better with killers who don't rely on add-ons much (you won't miss that much power playing Huntress without add-ons)
---
As for general advice - learn from experience. There's no way around. I mean, you can wait for 3-5 days for better survivors to rank up and leave you with worse ones... but facing better opponents you'll improve faster. Don't focus on how many kills you got. Focus on smaller things: does your chase game becomes better? Do you find/track survivors better?
---
Adrenaline, self care, balanced landing, fookin' ded'ard.
---
Yes ive been on pc for 3 weeks now and that was my first toxic chat
---
&gt;With new DS don't be a mindless bot and don't immediately pick up the guy who got unhooked. Slug them.
---
Obviously that's nice in theory, except the threat of this perk's mere existence means that to play around it, Killers are forced to slug every player who isn't running DS, just in case, making their gameplay super suboptimal. Then they have to decide if Deerstalker is worth it - to find the slugs. Then there are the times at end of match that your slug can possibly crawl out the gate, so you're forced to pick them up.
---
I hate when people simply mention that there is counterplay to perks, in a game where Killers don't know what you're running and playing around everything just isn't possible. This is similar to BBQ, where the threat of a Killer running this perk forces Survs to weigh the benefit of getting inside the radius just as a hook goes down.
---
Also Dead Hard to Balanced is a weird comparison to be making. Obviously Balanced creates a lot more space, but requires setup. Even when it works, it's often toward the start of a chase and the Killer, upon seeing he forced you to use it, can instead decide whether he'd like to abandon the chase and do something more time efficient. Whereas with Dead Hard, it's available FOR SURE when you need it, no special conditions required. Should pretty regularly be getting you a lot of extra loop time in too.
---
F for Freddy
---
Yup the disparity is clearer than glass. Thing is though, the people who are literally this bad will moan about Killers and them being "OP" when they literally play into the Killers' playstyle or something similar. 
---
I'm here like, so when YOU can't loop or last a little while in a chase, know how to 360, know when to vault or not to vault, how to work through Ruin, not to get trapped and bloodlusted at a pallet and not waste pallets, until then, they shouldn't be allowed to speak about anything about the gameplay unless it's asking for tips or help, any sort of talk that comes from those kinds of people deplete my IQ.
---
Just ignore the bad games. If a game has the option I usually just mute other players and stick to playing with friends.
---
Spine Chill is, in my opinion, a top tier perk. It makes every action I spend in a chase, and just out of it, well managed. I'll begin healing the moment the perk stops lighting up because I know the killer isn't chasing me anymore. It really helps me manage my time under intense situations
---
I only watched to see the mori again.
---
You have the leave game button, if u want to u can press it
---
You need to hold it until the bar is full, I hate it when I let go too early they should fix that BS.
---
what about his power? what can he do?
---
Pretty interesting design and perks so far, great job to you and your team!
---
I had a game just before this reset where all survivors were up, I had one person on the hook [first hook], and all the gens were done. I ended up winning that match because they all 'came to the rescue' aka to their deaths.
---
Survivors make a lot of mistakes. Capitalize and win, otherwise you'll never improve.
---
The movies have shown his face a bit
---
Ok while I don't agree that facecamping is a reason to dc, I atleast can understand people who do it.
---
However dc because Legion runs Sloppy Butcher? Thats the same shit as if a killer dc's because the Claudette runs Dead Hard.
---
Freddy main here - If you know how to utilize his Dream Demon well, he can be a very great killer as he constantly applies pressure to the whole team if you can sleep them. By using it well, you can keep track of every survivor, as well as slow down their action speed to 1/2 so they're almost forced to try and fail skill checks in order to wake up. If you try and just put one person to sleep and tunnel them, sure, but if you manage to sleep the entire team and make them hellbent on failing skillchecks (which isn't that hard if you know what you're doing), he can be a force to be reckoned with.
---
It's the rank progress. Pips are the white marks below your rank which you gain or lose depending on your performance in a match.
---
Why do people run slug builds?
---
Isn't that like, A incredibly toxic, and B incredibly stupid, since you get no points?
---
Or do you hook people after they are slugged?
---
But wait, this still leads to much less Sacrifice and Hunting points then normal right?
---
I dont mind leatherface but if they camp theres nothing you can do but gens
---
So it be just like the normal modes.
---
There is a ton of perks that have to be played around with no indication that the killer/survivor has it.
---
You don't heal in the killer's terror radius because they might have nurse's calling, you hide behind a gen/get into a locker when someone gets hooked to hide from potential bbq, you drop the pallet early vs someone who has enduring, because there is a chance they have spirit fury, you wait before you swing because someone might have dead hard, you do totems even tho NOED has no indicator, you don't clense the hex totem vs spirit because it's very likely she has haunted grounds, etc.
---
If you make it clear that someone is running perks which effects only work if you aren't expecting them, you completely remove the possibility of those perk ever seeing their effect in use. No1 would be running blood warden, deliverance, unbreakable, etc. because their effect would never trigger in a useful way.
---
Dead hard can be waited out, just have any patience and you won't be ever missing hits due to DH.
---
Wow what a piece of shit.
---
Can't wait for him to get banned lol.
---
Thats what I've been saying from the start. Same thing happens in R6 Siege. Just have it start at 10 minutes or something and gradually make it go up for every disconnect. However knowing this community I wouldn't be surprised if more than a third of the playerbase stopped playing because of their inability to DC like a little bitch anymore.
---
Even if a killer body blocks you for a whole game, who cares? gg easy win for my team. And they can't hold you hostage indefinitely with endgame anymore. Whats the issue? You're always at risk of getting the short straw in a asymmetrical multiplayer game, if you can't handle it then play a different game that doesn't have that risk.
---
 Get this DC penalty system in ASAP!
---
Please uninstall now. Thanks.
---
I find it hard to care about ingame trolling tbh.
---
I thought I had it all together.... But I was led astray
---
Csgo does build ups, 30 mins, 2hrs, 24hr, 1 week.
---
Why would I be banned ? I’ve done nothing wrong and even if I do one day I’ll just make another account lmao
---
How can you learn when someone is staring at you?
---
That doesn't make sense. It seems like Spine Chill is the run of the mill "This is a nice perk, but I can't use it since so many others are way better."
---
i just thought because they modeled the legions faces and he has eyes
---
The killer equivalent is getting a 4E because you tunneled the looper for 5 generators, got pissy when your NOED didn't work, then you go on Reddit and beg for survivor nerfs because goddamn actually being bad at the game, must be the oppositions being too much.
---
Nothing sucks more than getting caught and fucking face camped several games in a row.  You can't just say "hide better!" because people still get fucking pissy about Stealthettes.
---
Ah I see. Thank you.
---
It really should be triggered. Honestly i feel they should make yellow moris default

---
Wait WHAT?
---
No play against all groups. 4 mans are usually easy as they are so altruistic.
---
Pro tips thanks. I avoided small game cause I thought it was for getting out of traps easily I never actually read into. That would be perfect for killers who run NOED definitely going to run some of these perks in future games.
---
What images?
---
I play both frequently, and tbh it does feel a little more bittersweet when you get 3 kills with no gens done and they still get hatch. I actually liked the system before, if the team manages two gens  one person escaping is something I can live with. Now it removes that incentive, making endgame a real unbalanced scale. If the survivor finds hatch first, they didn't need to do anything that game except find the hatch and they've "earned" their win. As a killer, having already nailed 3 survivors and fucking the last out of their escape also feels too easy. I think the shorter gate timer is the perfect fix to even it out a bit more.
---
On the note of perks tho, whispers seems like ridiculously good in 1v1 endgame. Like if its going off at one gate, just walk off and turn right back around, because you already know they jumped the gate right after you left. 
---
And of course, as I have done multiple times, all you need to do is find the last survivor and chase until the timer runs out.
---
10/10 would upvote again
---
Get me pregnant you braindead cunt
---
I did wonder why I got no points for a gen completion, thanks for the info dude
---
If you failed to do the gens, failed to find the hatch first and failed to open a door before the Killer gets there, you don't deserve to escape.
---
You didn't finish that sentence either!
---
That seems pretty dumb if that's all the perk does...
---
Btw, what ARE his perks?
---
Instadown Hatches can be countered by learning to dodge or not moving in a predictable pattern, and if you don't like getting camped, you can just suicide on the hook (not that I would recommend that, since you can at least buy your team time on gens).
---
Imagine keeping up an argument when it doesn’t make sense in the first place /s
---
Do survivors not see the timer? I should really jump again to play again.
---
The current system is almost perfect. Survs need the “entity take me now I don’t want to be slugged”
---
Imagine replying to someone without a good counterpoint for your argument
---
I didn't believe it but holy crap I cant believe how different the character designs for the two were back then. That's really cool!
---
I completed 2 gens solo and got 277 obj score... wish I woulda read this sooner :/
---
All of which make a killing of microtransactions and are also backed by large funding. Riot, Epic, EA and Blizzard.
---
They can afford to be free-to-play when they rake in the dough by other means.
---
The developers are too scared to punish people who unintentionally disconnect to actually do anything about this issue. Here's a solution: get better internet, or just don't play team based games like DBD at all. If your internet is that bad to where you're disconnecting like that (excluding things like power outages, but those don't happen much, and if they do, then ooof), then it sounds like a personal issue you need to figure out. You put teammates at a disadvantage, on top of creating an environment where shitheads are safe to disconnect whenever something mildly inconvenient happens in their game.
---
There's always going to be shithead gamers and theres nothing to be done about that, so it's ultimately the developer's fault for allowing this to continue for so long.
---
If this is a paragraph (which is very likely), there won't be a PTB and this may well release on the 28th.
---
Even if it is a chapter, and even if it releases for the anniversary (either on the 11th or 18th of June), one month isn't much time to radically change anything.
---
Nurse can still fuck you up tho
---
... So you just want a Survivor to dick around for three minutes once they are the last one left, then die by the Entity?
---
Imagine that there is nothing I could disagree with and I just pointed out that the “I have a life” argument is not a fair agrument and has nothing to do with this discussion
---
Nothing will happen. If it makes you feel any better go to Google and look up the dbd eula and it lists offenses that could result in a ban. (The same eula that everyone agreed to upon installing the game)
---
It’s two minutes and you still have a chance. That’s the point.
---
Well I personally don't have a life. I'm more or less going after the original guy who is basically calling someone shit just because they have trouble with a "C tier" killer.
---
Everyone has certain killers they don't like to go against
---
Nope, you're good.
---
But what's the chance?
---
If you don't want the Hatch, then what do you propose happens once the 3rd guy is killed?
---
Huntress is like zarya,together we are strong.
---
Who the hell downvotes a legitimate question?
---
I swear someone on this sub fucking hates me or something
---
I didn't say I wasn't toxic, I said I wasn't SUPER toxic.
---
Fair enough, fellow of the fog.
---
Damn some people need to learn to chill huh, but like you say they're probably like 12. You won't get banned for that, don't worry.
---
It's a toxic community
---
So you never ever lost a survivor or at least some distance after being flashlighted at the pallet/window?
---
The second one. Two minutes are good, but no endgame RBTs are bad
---
Probably the only way you're going to get those achievements nowadays since Behavior made those pip changes, gotta get lucky and hook those potatoes.
---
What if it was like insta downs or something like noed or, devour hope stacks or something that makes it extremely situational
---
It protects you from killers m2 attack?  How dope would that be, getting sniped by huntress, she gets fkcked as when MOM procs. You won't get hit by it and temporary immunity to hatchet is like going against hag without traps
---
Same with Billy and bubbas chainsaw,  if the killer is camping with his chainsaw up, MOM protects you from the m2 attack?  But not m1, as with m1 they need to go through the wipe animation?
---
THAT would make the perk situational and have some downsides
---
Maybe that'll add some diversity of the gameplay to the cockiest survivors, as in they'll HAVE to sneak around instead of their usual chase taunting techniques, but yes, with whispers that'll be negated anyway, but to be fair who will run a perk only for that kind of situation, and I don't mean those who run it already because of any other reason, like they're good with it
---
I actually like Stridor. I like running perks that will help me like shadow born, stridor, etc because my situational awareness deteriorated along side my mental health :)
---
Agreed with both of ya
---
I escape via the gate around 40% of the time. You have a chance
---
Except, A is usually out of your hands if your team sucks, B is completely reliant on Luck, and C is impossible if the killer is Billy/the Gates are close.
---
Do you even survivor bro?
---
Ah, but how many of those escapes were given to you?
---
How many did you go against Billy?
---
I second this.
---
True...
---
The time required to open the door. If the killer closes the hatch, the door should be instantly at half bar progress, that's what the op says.
---
This subreddit is dangerous and full of terrors.
---
Self-care levels doesn't affect healing speeds, only medkit efficiency. 
---
How many stacks of Thanatophobia? 1 or 4?
---
They didn't wanna fall in the whole stereotypes so they switch them, vut it just ended up seeming they didn't wanna look racist, witch in the end if you ask me, just makes it look worse.
---
For Honor and all their other MP games are forced esports. TF2 doesn't (anymore lol) punish you for DCing in casual, L4D2 doesn't, CS:GO doesn't, CoD doesn't, BF doesn't, DST doesn't, RE6 doesn't, KF2 doesn't, shall I continue? The only games that punish people even in casual are shitter-esports games and of course competitive/ranked modes in certain games. DbD isn't an esports or competitive game in that sense.
---
The only time I don't say GG is when its Nurse or Legion. If its those two I make fun of them for having asthma and stage 4 terminal cancer
---
I tried but it was a facecamping doctor.... I’m not strong enough.
---
Oh I'm dumb... 4
---
Well technically we don't know if they have acquired the rights to the Scream franchise, only to the Ghostface mask.
---
So while we can be getting survivor/map, it doesn't have to be a part of Scream franchise.
---
yes
---
So we start with 32 seconds (base self care speed). 
---
Assuming all characters are injured, 16% of 32 is 5.12 so we’re at 37.12 seconds. 
---
Sloppy butcher is 25% (I believe) so 25% of 37.12 is 9.28. So now we add those and end at 46.4. 
---
50% of 46.4 is 23.2. 
---
Now we’re at 46.4 + 23.2, which is 69.6 seconds. 
---
This is math applying the order that you asked. I believe this should be the right answer.
---
Oooh, I have misread. Ty for correcting me.
---
Here! It's dangerous to go alone, take this!
---
"failed to do gens". If you're teammates are dead and the killer closes the hatch, that's not an option.
---
"fail to find the hatch". If the killer knows where it is, you don't have a chance.
---
"fail to open the door". If the doors are close, you don't have a chance either.
---
So pretty much, what happens most of the games: the killer kills all survs but you (not your fault), goes directly to the hatch (you can't do anything), he closes it and goes from door to door until he sees you or sees the red light of the door, which means you're there (again, you don't have a chance).
---
It's called client interpretation it's not a difficult concept.
---
its fake dude lol
---
Well thanks!
---
Damn. Pretty sure that's the longest it could take a person to heal too right?
---
You're welcome kind redditor.
---
It’s still ghostface lol might not be from the movie or tv show but it’s ghostface
---
They do, I was just being a friendly piggy and I guess they wanted to die for me.
---
God bless.
---
No it's not, it allows you to test killers and still get away safely. E.g Test if the killer will respect the pallet, if he does nice you get another loop or 2, if he doesn't respect, you get to make it around safely again with the use of dead hard.
---
Its not in files but they may add it later this was just a dev build.
---
Counting those which were given to we would be a statistical manipulation and I don’t do that. I didn’t count so I can’t really answer the second question. Some of them were against billy
---
¿Quieres?
---
&gt;Damn. Pretty sure that's the longest it could take a person to heal too right?
---
There is also Freddy dreamworld and Dying Light debuff.
---
Ghostface is also just a mask from a costume store.
---
The skins that have been found on the test build correlate with the ones avaliable in the store, especially the devil mask.
---
Is this fortnite????
---
They’ve already shortened the time to open gates and you get free powered gates if the killer closes the hatch. Your team failed to do the only objective of powering generators and you failed to get to the hatch first(killers cant even interrupt hatch jumps anymore). There are just some matches where if your team performs extremely poorly then it means nobody deserved to escape. tbh the free powered up gates are a second chance after a second chance (the hatch) so I think egc is fine how it is
---
What? You were tea-bagging him and just inviting him to chase you the whole time. You were as toxic as he was imo!
---
Behavior making ghostface as putting the character into the game, not creating ghostface the character itself lol.
---
Ghostface=scream
---
He was tunneling a dwight that’s how I got deliverance
---
Idk man it looked pretty decent to me.
---
Hold space btw
---
All this clip shows is you being an arsehole imo. Now if he was being "toxic" before that then I'll just have to take your word for it because that's not what's in this clip.
---
Basically smaller terror radius in chases when you hook the obsession up to 16 at Max but you lose 1 if the obession dies. That's all we know so far.
---
Things can makes sense in games but it ultimately must be fun for the players, perhaps people are looking for new mechanics
---
Instead of cutting door open time in half, increase the door light thresh hold, making it so the first red light won't turn on until the door is 50% open. This will prevent survivors from getting ezmode escapes while at the same time allowing them to tap the door then go back into hiding as the killer comes back.
---
Sometimes Dbd does feel like some freaking mod for Stardew Valley I tell you
---
You know, actually looking at that corn, if I was chasing someone and they jumped in their IRL, they’d be long gone. Guess the game is somewhat realistic.
---
Hey, thanks about this heads up, now I get it why I missed some BP's :)
---
rank = skill OMEGALUL amirite
---
Not that rare actually, if you are nice to other people they will be nice to you. As killer, I always say "ggs" and there's often at least one survivor who says gg back. It's really depending on the match outcome though.
---
There is very little you can do ingame to earn a ban. The only thing I can think of is if you bodyblock a survivor into a corner and then go afk.
---
All self care levels heal at the same rate
---
Well, yeah. The leaks showed us that it is.
---
If you don't have daily or don't care about the win just go for it. Borrowed time? Then you'll be thankful.
---
The only problem is that the Killer might be camping the hook just because he wants to get all of the kills or just doesn't have BBQ. But Survivors rule nowadays is that don't overfeed Killers' ego. It's gonna result in some nasty reactions.
---
Originally if you blinded Legion during his frenzy it would stun him and deplete his power completely, now it just takes him out of feral with no downsides. A complete 180 from how it was.
---
You won’t get banned
---
Your average survivor has been babied and handheld for the past 2 years, and the majority of good survivor mains have gotten tired of potato teammates and have moved over to SWF. If you're gonna solo queue, you might as well build a perk loadout that benefits you the most.
---
Isn't the definition of a crutch perk something that helps you learn but isn't as useful later on? Isn't it a synonym for training wheels?
---
I feel like we should be looking at the stats the devs just released to back up these assertions. Sometimes as a survivor, you just get screwed. It's okay to just take the L when it happens.
---
Sorry but again youve failed your objective twice. You still haveca chance but it should definitly favour the killer at that point
---
Thanks for this, I watched the gameplay clips but was confused about what was going on. I'm really interested in seeing on how this plays out. I can't tell if the power is strong or weak or what:  Being able to expose a survivor in two seconds seems strong, but the stealth power doesn't seem as stealthy as I had thought.
---
When it gets down to almost 1 survivor just wait by the gate. 50/50 they check wrong one and you're out. Looking for hatch is suicide for a survivor, since it being shut in front of you is guaranteed death.
---
If you're in a situation where your whole team is dead and the killer closed the hatch, you have lost TWICE. Get over it.
---
This has escalated rather quickly.
---
A killer saying GG even tho he got 0 kills because survivors just were better
---
That's what I feel most of the comments on this thread are missing. No perk should every completely nullify a killer's power. 
---
Someone even said it was THE counter to stealth killers? Like, not really, imo. A killer should never turn into a m1 killer because of one survivor's perk.
---
You mean they gave Legion a buff? Is this Opposite World?
---
You must be playing with killers that like to tunnel, because in regular games it's absolutely useless.
---
His YouTube content is really well edited, none of that copypasta straight from twitch bullshit. His twitch gameplay is all right, he more entertaining than good these days but that's fine tbh.
---
Or he could have been instructed to disclose this, specifically to lessen the shock if it does ultimately turn out there won't be a map or survivor (or not licensed ones, anyway). Going from the idea of a "Scream Chapter" to a "killer-only Ghostface 'knock-off' DLC" would make the reveal more of a disappointment than anything else, and so maybe both the leaks and this information was shot out into the community to let some of that disappointment gradually work itself off, rather than hitting all at once.
---
But this is just idle speculating. Given that it will be the "Chapter" for the game's 3rd year anniversary, I would expect at least an original (and likely Scream-inspired) map and survivor to come with it, as sizing down from their thus-far scheduled Chapter releases for an anniversary would just be odd.
---
Who the fuck rage quits against the 3rd worst killer in the game?
---
Quite pleased. You didn't have to of course, it looks great either way
---
SB, Deliverance activated, DS, MOM, taunting the killer to chase you... t-bagging... yeah, the killer is the toxic one...
---
Nobody :
---
Survivors : Mettle of Man, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Balanced Landing and an offering for Haddonfield.
---
Pain Reliever, you mean?
---
Its because he's from the Nightmare on Elm Street reboot.
---
Which is fair enough because otherwise (and especially with their decreased vaulting speeds), a flashlight would basically make you immune to Frenzy, as Legion would never be able to vault a pallet or window against you. With this change, you can still blind them and sneak away, but not more-or-less hard-counter their ability.
---
It should be difficult, but not damn near impossible. Like I said, the only shot you have at getting out of the gates is if they spawn as far apart as possible, you've got a potato killer or they let you have it. And the killer can easily beeline to the hatch if they know where it is when the 2nd to last survivor is DOH.
---
I am the danger I am the killer. You think someone gets slashed and put up on a hook and you think that of me? I AM THE ONE WHO HOOKS.
---
So when finally survivors depend on killer’s mistake it’s bad, but when the killers depended on your mistakes for 3 years they had to “git gut”. Gotcha
---
fuck everybody else
---
i respect you
---
Well, while I don't know how to fix it, dedicated servers are coming soon, which should remove that problem entirely
---
Yeah he may have hacked the game but never to get himself an advantage in the game. Plus he's actually gotten a lot less scummy in recent times.
---
I got absolutely smashed as Killer today. 
---
Could barely find anyone at all, got looped endlessly by the only 2 survivors I ever saw, it was a shit show on my part.
---
(Don’t play dbd when you are tired.)
---
All 4 got out but in the chat 2 survivors were really nice and encouraging.
---
It really helped me from feeling like total shit. I want to have a good game. I don’t like giving people a shit game if I happen to suck.
---
Its only if one survivor left. Don't forget that other survivors can activate Endgame
---
*laughs in trapper*
---
I'd kinda would rather have that version in the game tbh. Hear me out, yeah it's shit compared to the OG design but atleast with THAT it'll actually be Ghostface.
---
I'm not willing to give him a third chance. I'm not interested in discussing the degree that he hacked and cheated.
---
Try hiding from the survivors for the entire game
---
Those big strong arms.
---
4 hours late
---
that explains why he was following you, because it was tunneling dwight.
---
Hey, let me whisper you a lil thing: rank reset
---
People just feel it dumbs you down, you should learn to detect killers without it and use something else. Same with whispers on killers.
---
The same thing happens for palette stuns too, for the record. Found that out while doing a legion daily ritual
---
With the guys its obviously because of david
---
Yeah, when I plan on playing killer for awhile I switch my contact preferences to friends only so no one else can message me hate,
---
Thank-fucking-you!
---
well fuck me too if you have sum booty
---
Tier 1 Myers is supposed to trump all stealth detection
---
Mr X as a killer would be terrifying and I don't like it.. but cool to play as
---
Try random perks, I believe there are sites that do that.
---
It’s always the last box for me more often then not.
---
Ah yes. 
---
Run noed and then be toxic because you have noed. 
---
Solid stuff.
---
Maybe then No Mither would be useful to something other than memes
---
lmao, did those 2 have a reason for doing that for you or?
---
Playing Freddy , downing the last survivor , carrying survivor to the hatch and then closing it right in front of them causing them to DC
---
People that tap against ruin 1 annoy me, it’s 3% get over it.
---
can I have a version of this without Harambe
---
It’s more that traps are useless once the end game starts.
---
You're the one using noed.
---
I think your internet is very shit or you were downloading something
---
I run monitor no matter what, it helps you get close to people, and during a chase it expands his aura reading, it helps his power in every way.
---
Mentioning DS and BT as crutch in 2019. I don't even know those perks exist when I play killer lol
---
its such a peace of mind slugging everyone when they get too cocky
---
Survivor: 
---
I once dead harded to the hatch as a doctor missed their swing. 
---
I faced a Meyers who had made quick work of my team mates. I managed to avoid him after for long enough to spawn the hatch, so I hunt for it. He finds me, pops his tier 3, and drops me at the hatch and said "you deserved it." 
---
Killer: 
---
As hag, I got everyone hooked in the basement because they all went to unhook eachother while I was standing right there. 
---
As new Legion, I was getting bodied due to a large map but pulled out the 4k with one gen left.
---
Another day, another survivor main with made up rules killers must abide by.
---
Blinding the killer while he's breaking a pallet = You watch OchiDO? Wtf?
---
Had the same thing happen as a piggy. I was literally going to let a claudette live and I chased her to the gate after she used her unbreakable, let her open the gate and instead of running out she chose to heal.
---
I hate stuff like this. He’s clearly inexperienced/casual. I don’t understand why survivors have to be cunts to killers who are trying to get better. Same with killers. Can’t we all be fair?
---
So I should let him down me?
---
I hope they return it, and just treat it like a down or hook,
---
Entity is not programmed to think something about this, you should at least unlocked an achievement ("EZ game") there.
---
It's highly unlikely that you're the only one thinking that
---
The problem is that sometimes people disconnect due to internet issues. It will be unfair to ban them for such a long time if it's out of their hands.
---
Pretty sure it's 1 light every 25%
---
Dying Light + Thanatophobia + Sloppy Butcher + Coulrophobia
---
When survivors just try to escape and get shafted by bullshit hitboxes. Those swings should NEVER have connected.
---
Think it's just mostly the mentality. I'm not saying killers are never toxic, but survivors seem to just thrive on doing whatever they can to piss people off. Killers do the same thing in retaliation, but from playing survivor and killer, I feel like it's almost always survivors that set it off. That or the killer is just having a rough game and wants to vent some frustration from getting pallet looped the entire game, which is a whole nother problem.
---
Laughs in the SWF team who disable all your traps.
---
Killers kill. Suck it up, survivors. Open the gates and run out.
---
I didn't mind MoM being instroduced at first, I just equipped Remember Me and Dark Devotion to benefit from the perk. But ever since the Remember Me nerf, I can't handle Mettle of Man anymore
---
I don't think they will release him on the 28th, because that was the day of the announcement. If i would say a date it would be betweem 1-6 june, just like how ash was announced and available shortly after.
---
Oh lol
---
Anima is great as well! Not a big fan of Stefano tho, he never really felt "intimidating" to me and way too ... Human-ish
---
Personally, for me, it just stems from the fact that it just looks so boring. That being said, I don't know if it will be, but it looks so boring. I use to main pig for about a year, and what drew me to her is just that she fit her aesthetic well, she brought a new play style to life, and while she filled the stealth archetype, she did it in a different way. Myers especially did the stealth thing in a super different way, seeing as he doesn't actually stealth at all, he just preys off people that don't stay aware. Ghostface just...kinda does the same thing they do...just...again...It makes sense from the context of the movie, of them following the plot of a horror movie as their MO, but...that doesn't make it fun.   
---
That being said, I'm totally hoping I'm wrong, and that ghostface will be a blast. Just...Not very convinced.
---
typical bhvr
---
This makes my groovy go solid.
---
I imagine shrek saying killer the way he says donkey and I can't is stucked in my head now, appreciated
---
It's Friday the 13th kind of feeling
---
If that's the case, it should be a once in a while thing you shouldn't even notice too much unless you have really bad internet. Even so, if you're getting DCed left and right due to your faulty internet, you're still screwing your teammates over and not fixing your own technical issues.
---
I thought how shrek would sound saying killer the way he says donkey and I it's stucked in my head now, appreciated
---
Killers complaining about mom again? :) Where are the posts about noed, tuneling, camping?
---
I can understend no noed, but no ruin is seppuku
---
All I see is an Ash that doesnt do any objectives but purposefully taunts the killer to chase him again and again even after the clearly less experienced killer lost him twice. "Should I just let him down me?!?" No, but after he lost you, you couldve done a gen or just got out. Instead you clearly noticed he was less experienced and even purposefully used your whole build to trigger him even more, even though that was completely unnecessary. "but he hit me on the hook" well yeah because at that point you were already being a major cunt. Like someone else already said: toxicity breeds toxicity.
---
Its my temper. I like to troll idiots who deserve it but then I often forget that they dont have anything to do in their lives and being a kewboard warrior is their destiny and they take it very seriously. This is my last post, as I dont want to waste anymore time on you. Bye.
---
My point is I'll play some games where the survivors are really good and coordinated. They disarm all my traps and dont give me enough time for anything so I have to chase people. Good survivors can turn trapper into a m1 killer.
---
Regardless if there are 5 gens left.
---
I run a speed build where i get hit once and vanish till the end of the game. Never allow yourself to get healed or it ruins it. Uses adrenaline, sprint burst, and two injured perks(i’ll edit once i can check, i’m out of the house right now) that speed up the process like crazy. If you want to somewhat gen rush use this cause you get hit once, vanish with sprint, then sneak around and finish all the gens while playing like it’s only stealth, no chance at running.
---
That still doesn't answer my question
---
It doesnt matter how many gens they have left. One survivor, hatch will open.
---
So that just leaves 1 more totem on the map. Would've been amazing if the killer had a totem themed name.
---
That still doesn't answer my question, can you even read?
---
Yeah, I should add I like it as survivor more as well since it adds a bit of pressure end game as well an encouraging team-mates not to be dicks
---
I did do a gen lol this is a short clip 4 min before this he was Tunneling a Dwight that’s how I got my deliverance lol at the start of the video you see him breaking a pallet he lost the Dwight then got on me
---
I'm terribly sorry, you like to troll people who deserve it (I.e. having an opinion, according to you) but then they're the ones who don't have anything to do with their lives?
---
Sir, I'm simply trying to be mature about this. Come on, we can work something out, don't try and paint me like I'm wrong simply because you very quickly ran out of things to say. I at least expect the maturity to be met halfway, otherwise there's only so far I can go.
---
That a thought, but it is easy to tell if the killer knows where you are.
---
Can you? Do you know what generators are? Do you know what survivors are? If theres ONE survivor left. When you killed the other three. Even if theres 5/4/3/2/1 GENS left. The HATCH will open.
---
Funny, cos when I'm killer they only say GG when they mean "Ha fuck you you couldn't kill any of us" when they're a rank 1 premade having been knocked back by rank reset.
---
&gt;Hello everyone, I just wanted to ask If the hatch spawn time is still the same after the new update Or does it only spawn when there is only one survivor left now?
---
Yes, they kept the same rules. The only change is when there is one survivor left, hatch will spawn open no matter how many gens were done.
---
I went through a whole match as obsession leading the killer through loops. Usually i’m garbage at loops and i had no obsession perks, the killer had one though. Managed to get my team to do all the gens while i was chased through loop after loop barely living. Didn’t escape because the killer refused to let me off a loop but it was still an amazing game where killer only got a 1 kill game.
---
Read the fucking question dude, I didn't wanted to know when it opens - I wanted to know if the spawn time is still the same
---
what is that chat even? do people message each other on ps4 after the game?
---
Some do, yes
---
Playing like i do but i run a toolbox or medkit instead of flashlight...
---
Hey buddy, friendly reminder this is an asymmetrical game, survivors have advantages the killer doesn’t, such as power in numbers, and killers have advantages the survivors don’t, like the expose status. Just because you can’t manage to even get a single sacrifice without having it handed to you on a iridescent platter, doesn’t mean having friends and teamwork is a broken mechanic. Maybe actually try learning how to play instead of bitching on reddit
---
Lately I've started to not run it on killers that are usually expected to have it (Wraith, Freddy, Pig etc).
---
Survivors will spend time cleansing dull totems while you can use a more beneficial perk.
---
Trapper is really dependent on your trap placement. There are some rare places where survivors just can't disarm traps other way than stepping in it first (those windows on Haddonfield for example). But mostly it is a good idea to set at least half of your traps not directly near windows/pallets, but a bit afar from it on the bushes at places survivors gonna loop that window/pallet. Also Whispers is really good for trapper, it if somebody is around while you are setting your trap.
---
In my opinion his trap placement is a rather deep skill. Just keep practicing him if you like him as a killer.
---
Wow thank you, finally someone who is able to understand my question! - cause I just wanted to know the SPAWN time and not when it does open cause I know it :)
---
Her Ultra-Rare add-on Waterlogged Shoe is described as having belonged to a child and both her Ultra-Rates belonged to the Lisa that wasn't a Mud Revenant.
---
She's definitely not an adult, and while I can't remember the source on 16 specifically, I'm fairly sure it's canon.
---
It's not a must have but definitely helps shut down strong loops faster like jungle gyms, killer shack, cow loop, etc
---
You could have easily just escaped the chase. Instead you basically forced him to follow you and then taunted him. That's douche behavior all around my friend. You claim "he was chasing me, was I supposed to let him down me?"
---
Seemed alot more like you were purposely chasing him and taunting him. Ever think that Dwight was just as shitty as the killer and kept walking into him over and over. I see this all the time.
---
Yeah same unless I see them looking for the totem
---
I like that as idea so long a RNG also keeps a decent spread between the three.
---
The play dynamic is greatly changed with the implementation of EGC with a single final survivor.
---
It's a different game at that point. It's a PvP thing.
---
 The killer hasn't "won" so long as there is a survivor left and the nature of balanced game play implies that a single survivor still has a chance in a one in one endgame.  
---
(And on a side note since it's happened multiple times to me already, If you're going to slug and drop a survivor, block gates but not chase and generally waste a survivor's time during the Endgame until the timer runs out and the Entity comes you're a toxic piece of shit player and no amount of "...but survivors were toxic to me, so I get to do it to other people now" justifies your bullshit.)
---
Actually I just got fucked by nurse even with that shit
---
Literally couldn't agree more. I feel the killers that complain about DS and BT aren't very good at the game and sit very close to hooks because they're desperate for at least that 1 kill. 
---
In actual fact, the more you go after the rescuer you're more likely to do well, not to mention that I can't help but feel going after the guy who got farmed off hook is such a dick move, just making their gameplay experience terrible because someone else wanted points.
---
I ran the numbers, and if you add dying light to your build, of course, obsession dead, 3 stacks thanata, in TR, its would take approximately 2 minutes. 4 minutes if in dream state.
---
I did see BT before the changes, and yeah it was even more ridicolous somehow. My problem with Borrowed Time is the End Game Collapse. Look, I know a killer should have at least done some serious damage before all gens are powered but sometimes you just get unlucky: some really bad tiles, lots of pallets, you aren't playing a fully decked out killer, ruin gets found immediately... It does happen, just like 0 gens done games happen to survivors. At that point, you as a killer, unless you have something to 1-Hit-Down survivors, can't literally do anything: they rush the hook with Borrowed Time, they usually have Mettle of Man, sometimes Decisive Strike, always an exhaustion perk to gain distance, probably the unhooker is body blocking and they already are on the other side of the map by the time you get to them. You could get the unhooker, but then again, if the gate is close enough you just can't stop them most of the time; hell, if you go for the unhooker, the unhooked guy bodyblocks, since he has at least 2 or 3 layers of protection. In normal play, I'm not bothered by Borrowed Time: it's a good perk, but it's not the best perk ever; during EGC it can fuck right off. But this is just a personal opinion.
---
It’s not needed like bbq and ruin but it is my favorite perk imo (aside from the meta perks)
---
I think OP is referring to the massive camping potential leatherface has with his chainsaw.
---
The cherry on top with that hatch escape.
---
The time to power up a gate was faster some time ago, but the developers increased it again because it was too op for the survivors, imagine if the gates were open immediatelly after the killer closes the hacth? The survivors would just wait close to the gates and exit right away, that's why it isn't that way.
---
The gates proximity RNG isn't that bad to be honest, because it's fair, some times it helps the killer by spawning close to each other, other times it helps the survivor as the gates spawns each at one side of the map.
---
Thought this was gonna be an [*ENTITY DISPLEASED*] meme
---
DS and BT aren't issues anymore. Dead Hard is easy to counter by just waiting to swing. Mettle is a little annoying but it's kinda countered by a bunch of the cast with special attacks, but I don't really personally mind playing against it. 
---
Skeleton key is the only annoying thing really, because the survivors can bypass doing a generator (which is kinda important) and get a free escape.
---
The only thing in the OP meme that I get frustrated with is NOED. Only counter is finding all 5 totems, which makes you worry about it all game, and if you fail to do so killer gets a free speed boost and 1 shot. Devour Hope  1 shots/mori makes more sense with its token system and the fact it's always a lit totem from the start. NOED isn't earned.
---
Then they better punish people who dodge lobbies aswell
---
I didn’t mention camping, but if an injured person and a healthy person are next to each other, I’m going after the injured one.
---
Nobody wnjoys playing against a nurse because u cant do anything against her
---
Other then the gates spawning to close together, this is an amazing change,
---
"Invisible"

---
It's not "impossible" as a lot of people keep claiming. It's a new mechanic that hasn't been in long, and like any change in dbd it takes time to adapt and form strategies. In terms of lore, the last bit of hope helps to feed the entity 👍
---
If you are close and survivors are agressive (I bet it's right in the endgame), unhooker already has injured state and around 1.5 seconds of headstart - it's more than enough to not let them leave, unless you get bodyblocked by other 2 players
---
Like poetry. 10/10 man you deserve that shit.
---
The unhooker isn't always in the injured state, and if he is going for that aggressive unhook he does have a second chance perk active, for sure.
---
5 gen chases take a decent amount of skill against a shitty killer and an insane amount against a good one. You are the hero this world needs
---
I was about to reply but then realized id probs get r / wooshed (not actually tagging it because I got it 🤙)
---
Especially the one way windows. 
---
Where the only way to disarm them is to have a survivor step in on and have another survivor untrap you.
---
I'm super agaisnt DCing because you dont like the killer but leatherface is the exception.
---
The blade is extra hidden. She is just loving the sub rn. Oink oink 💖
---
The comment made me smile but the username made me lol.
---
I hope she does.... miss piggy I love you! 😩
---
I get excited when I see diet bully.
---
1. They don't get away for free. They have a purely altruistic perk and suddenly it gets paid of by unhooked survivor being grateful
---
And it's rare
---
2. It's pretty hard to pull off and easy to counter. You just don't swing instantly.
---
3. Honestly with how much risk it takes and with how much coordination and mutial altruism it requires, I feel they deserve it on those very rare occasions they actually pull it off
---
But it's still doesn't change a thing it's more rational to hit the unhooker. If unhooked could protect them with BT, it means they had BT in the first place and you wouldn't get that down either way
---
Autodidact to progress backwards
---
She was low teir for people who didn't know how to use her ambush.
---
No
---
Haven't you found the recent sound nerfs to be crippling? Spirit's my second main and I love her, but recently I haven't been able to hear shit without Stridor, when I used to be able to track people by sound very precisely.
---
You didn't do anything wrong, so you won't get banned. You don't get banned for losing, but hopefully they'll be banned for the shit they said.
---
Sounds that aren't playing at all because sound is broken (again), period, aren't going to play if you make them louder. Louder silence is still silence :(
---
I mean am I wrong? I think he'll get the pig treatment and just nerfed to low tier.im hoping not but I mean we are talking about the devs that nerfed DS just to add MoM into the game.
---
The meme is them actually finishing the rework
---
Hahaha totally
---
So what you're saying is that we should have a Shiny Glaceon in DBD.
---
There are some weird hurt box issues with terrain. EGC will help in some of these scenarios as long as it finishes before they bleed out. Either way it's still a win in my book.
---
From my own experience, no, YOLO savers 95% ot time don't have a second chance perk active (they may have fookin Dead 'ard, but that is easy to counter). MoM and DS have too strict windows of opportunity to time moment exactly when you need it to trigger. They just expect you to go for the unhooked person or they want to trade hooks.
---
First: Sudoku is a game with numbers, you mean seppeku. Second: Haddonfield, to me, is average. It is better than the preschool map and far better than the swamps.
---
Yeah, that was the joke.
---
Lineless art is super hard! I think some light shading would be nice! Unless flat colors are your thing, then id add in a more broader array of colors! I love it &lt;3 take my upvote oink oink
---
I dont play alot of freddy so forgive my ignorance. Why cant you pick up people on the floor if they are being healed? Because the people doing the healing lock them in place?
---
*noun*  
---
1.  
---
a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter, especially a story with a funny punchline.
---
fair point, i use it as a safeguard
---
You know, ..., some people would become hella mad by this, especially with the Meg Cosmetic that cost Real-Life cash.
---
That doesn't go for silent killers like Wraith or Pig.
---
And even for loud killers, it's still very useful. If you're in the terror radius and Spine Chill isn't lit up, then you know you're safe for the moment because he's busy with something else
---
Legend has it that Detective Tapp taps the gen even if there is no ruin
---
Again, even if they don't have a second chance perk, the unhooked person can still bodyblock, as they effectively have 2 health states at the moment. That is usually enough to give them a lot of distance, so unless you literally place them far,  far away from any opened gate, they can get away. Does it take awareness of the situation. Yes. Does it take coordination? Yes, a bit. Can the killer usually do anything about that? Not unless you have a way to hit them in one down, or to suppress your terror radius or to catch up to them after the unhook while they were outside of your TR.
---
Yes but it'll be slower than a normal repair.
---
Lol and the cycle continues.
---
It’s fake no one believes this
---
And I take it you don't watch videos for information before commenting I take it?
---
If the killer downs all your teammates, and manages to even find the hatch before you, you have lost, as simple as that. The hatch is supposed to be the last hope of escaping and the EGC after is just "well if the killer is afk, or really bad, you can still have a chance". Honestly, I think at that point the killer has deserved a 4k and you deserve to lose
---
Yeah, with most other killers you just smack the person away but with freddy you need to put them into the dream state first and then smack them away.
---
No killer can pick a survivor up who is being healed. It just sucks especially hard for Freddy who has to wait that additional 4-7 seconds for the healer to fall asleep. Healing someone who go downed right by the exit gate line is a good tactic because it forces the killer to hit the survivor and hopefully allow the dying one to crawl out.
---
i expected more up votes but i guess i was late or people havent actually watched texas chainsaw massacre
---
No, not loving this
---
I feel like they should’ve at least let you choose to play from two modes, the regular mode and end game collapse
---
Play survivor and learn hiding spots for them, so you will have a easier time finding them as killer.
---
Tracking and stall perks like Whispers, BBQ, A Nurse's Calling, Ruin and Sloppy Butcher also exist.
---
And play Huntress and see if you can find survivors as her. If you can find survivors with a killer who has 45 meters of directional Lullaby, then you will can find survivors with any other killer.
---
Shaun would be a paragraph as it makes sense for him to just be a survivor. Highly doubt Capcom would ever let their baby be handled by anyone but if I am wrong I rather have Nemesis. AvP yeah pick Predator but it doesn't make much lore sense if you think about it, a xenomorph would be a pain to animate and lore makes it rough.
---
Oh yea most of the work throwing down pallets when there was no need, taunting a killer that is still learning... hey if you need to feel pro then yes you did an awesome work and everyone should learn from you cause you are clever and skilled, I would give you a cookie but I only have two and my bf already asked me for one
---
Oof
---
Well, you are getting blinded by a flashlight, after all.
---
If you use it as a beginner you may never learn to loop. Once you know how to loop it stops being crutch.
---
I "took a break" but only return to check out new killers.
---
Without any new game modes it gets stale
---
I understand the viewpoint but I'd rather just go next instead of playing a map that just isn't fun to play on.
---
I always think it is better to cleanse it in the beginning of the match and get rid of it than later by mistake
---
I get called a tunneller if I attack injured people....
---
Cool beans
---
either the gates spawn insanely close and killer insta wins or they spawn miles apart which is frustrating on the killer side cause its basically a crap shoot on which gate to go to. but nobody cares bout if the killer gets the rough egc setup right?
---
You can also easily see if a Dc is intentional bye the sound of it.
---
If it makes no sound that means it wasn’t intentional
---
I should say I am still fairly new to DbD, so thank you for making me aware of the whole range thing. I agree with just about everything you said execpt that Alien/Predator are too "sifi" for DbD, like it'd be different if it was a Robot shooting lasers n shit but the Xenomoroph specifically would probably mostly rely of it's claws and my utilizing the acid thing in some form, admittedly Predator is a bit borderline but again I'd only see him using his camouflage ability and the wrist blade, maybe the infrared thing.
---
1. I'd say if something requires luck, setup and is hard to pull off, than the result is definitely not free,
---
2. Just in case you don't know it already: hitting the unhooker resets the unhook process. So if they were unhooked while being healthy, they will start unhooking again being injured :) And yeah it is easy to counter by just aiming at the right person and waiting a bit for the unhooked person to run away. Man, if it happens as often as you describing it, you should expect it already.
---
3. Just time your hits, what can I say. It takes practice, but it's not that hard.
---
I enjoy it on both sides but one thing I dislike is how the killer can bodyblock a surv into a corner and make them die because of that, besides that though it's fun.
---
I love endgame but I found out killers can abuse the end game timer and hold you hostage until the entity eventually kills you. I got downed after they found the hatch before me and was forced to wait until the entity killed me because they apparently earn more points for that then hooking me.
---
It's true! But, I don't really blame them I guess. I REALLY hate playing against Billy. But then again, I say GG and move on. 
---
I'm just glad I found another fun killer!
---
*yesiknowlegionisanm1killerandcanthusbedefeatedbymultiplestrategiesimjustsayingthatthisparticularonesucksreallyhardtoplayagainst*
---
Wait what’s the saber tooth cat one?
---
Battlehag:
---
-Agi, IG, Mad Grit, filler perk.
---
Whenever you down someone, pick them up but don't hook them, run around with them as your battlebuddy :D
---
True fear is camping hatch (pre patch) as pig and then you look over and there is a Nea 3 feet from your face just staring at you
---
If it doesn't make a notification sound when they DC they either pulled plug, turned pc off, turned the game off through task manager or crashed, I like to assume they crashed generally since the game is very unstable.
---
What about lore would make them rough exactly? I know Predators are proud warriors and don't attack unarmed people but they could just go with a "Rogue" Pred as those have popped up in Predator media.
---
I’d rather a survivor get rewarded for doing the objective (keeping the killer busy/doing gens) than someone getting rewarded for sucking
---
Well fuck you too
---
It's not a bug, it's just dogshit design, gotta be extra careful to not release too early.
---
I run more toxic builds as survivor. Toxic builds go both ways mate.
---
Counter point to this is that most decent survivors who run adrenaline don't tend to heal up much during the match and just do gens. You wait for adrenaline to heal you. I spend most of the match injured at a risk to myself. I don't think adrenaline is OP in that regard. I've had adrenaline save me in clutch moments some times but most of the time it's VERY situational. I'd say 80% of the time if we've made it to the point of getting all the gens done then the killer wasn't a threat enough where I even needed it.
---
Send a support ticket.
---
I've personally had 600k bp compensated for a mini-reset within 24h
---
Because most players don't actually try to get better.
---
Again, a killer can just time their hits better. Especially if he's expecting that trick already.
---
Pretty cool.
---
I got a killer commenting on my profile that I was a hero in game chat, and that I had puding in my pants.
---
I'm on console so i can't :(
---
He isn't meta, but he got a better than he used to be and more importantly, he's very easy to use. He's very straight forward - pick up and use killer
---
Most killers are garbage, I'm literally shocked when I don't get tunneled, face camped, body blocked and all of the other killer behaviors that have ruined this game.
---
Not if they are SWF.
---
Hey you see that killer shack? Go to where the window is pointing and you will see me.
---
You claim this killer is being toxic by camping you and hitting you on the hook. I don’t blame him. You knew he was inexperienced so you decide to teabag him WAY before he hit you on the hook. keep him following you to rub it in his face and decide to carry that on with MoM at the end. 
---
If anything it’s people like you who create cunty killers or put people off playing this game. I can understand if your being toxic to a genuinely good killer who knows what there doing but doing it to a new killer/casual kinda makes you look weak. 
---
So to wrap this up, I hope I get to face you one day. You won’t like it 😘
---
he used to be hot, but burned down and now is nothing but Ash
---
Who called them crutches? Unless you're saying Nurse's and BBQ are crutches too then idk wtf you're smoking.
---
They're meta, no one is calling them crutches though lol
---
What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land.
---
Nurses is also always good when you run Monitor and Abuse anyway, simply because it removes the 1 counterplay to Nurses, which is not healing in the tr
---
My video started buffering at the time when you saw claudette healing lol
---
Oh I see that makes more sense! I know he has a massive disadvantage at the moment, especially with old hatch grabs and him not being able to make them. 
---
Can he still grab people out of lockers?
---
I could equip the most powerful setup in the entire game and if someone runs on corn, I'll lose them. I think I have corn blindness
---
Oh I see so they body block you then wait til you sleep them and run. That's brutal
---
How is that toxic? LOL
---
Yeah as soon as he opens the locker a survivor is in they’re pulled into the dream world and he pulls them out the locker.
---
Eh, depends what you're going for rly.
---
I never run Ruin on Hag, Nurse or Billy, as there are better perks, but on Doctor or Huntress for example if I'm tryharding I'll use Ruin, because it helps in bad maps, though if you're just having fun Ruin isn't a necessity whatsoever.
---
When you flash a killer there's literally text on the screen that says "flash light stun". Or something.
---
There isn't a category for tunneling and camping. But hey, enjoy your pettiness.
---
I'm sorry for this but "Lol Just time your hits better 4head". At the single handed moment the survivor is unhooked, even if you "time your hits better", you waste a fuckton of time to do so. And during that time, the survivor is already through the exit gate. Bodyblock isn't desinged to give perfect protection, it's done to stall the killer out. Given the fact that they already both have two health states and maps aren't that big, they usually can get away because you phisically don't have the time to "time hits better" if the other survivor shoves themselves between you and the other one. When you hit a survivor you do slow down quite a lot to do your "clean your weapon" animation. If both unhooked and unhooker were going the same way (at the nearest open exit gate), it takes nothing for them to literally tailgate the survivor you just hit, and it's now borderline impossible to catch up to the injured survivor, especially in smaller maps.
---
yes, we cannot praise the devs until at least the infinite loading screens are fixed.
---
So weird he didnt do that with hatch grabs then, same concept. How is he after the update? I guess his perks are very good in the end game
---
Yeah its horrible. Especially because when a survivor is healed off the ground they are automatically woken up so you have to resleep the one that you already had downed a second ago which usually takes long enough for them to get to a pallet or window loop
---
Tbh cannibal is my favorite killer to face
---
Of course some characters won't be free, as they are licensed and they have to pay licensing fees for them. But you are still able to obtain all their perks just with playtime - you just can't play the killer/survivor without money. Yes it takes a long time to farm all that, but all that also didn't exist when the initial game launched - they added a bunch of new characters since launch, with 2 DLCs and even Bill being free.     
---
Hostage situations, hatch standoffs etc. happened far too often and were annoying - in my opinion the endgame collapse solves these quite well.   
---
Yes, infinite loading screens suck ass, but do you really think they're not working on it?   
---
Oh. I don't know what I'm talking about, while you want graphic designers to work as software engineers? Makes sense dude. I doubt you have ever worked in Software Development otherwise you'd know that you're talking shit. Yes, BHVR has 450+ employees, but as you say they also do other things besides Dead by Daylight - meaning not all employees work on dbd, and definitely not all as software engineers. Riot Games e.g. has 2500+ employees - that's 2500 ONLY working on League of Legends.
---
No. If the killer found the hatch before you did then that’s on YOU.
---
When I play killer I always play the huge terror radius/bp farming kit. I rarely get disconnects, honestly the people who might do this usually give up at 2 gens and just let me kill them.
---
They seem to get tired of failing skillchecks. Doctor is obnoxious, but if you arent afraid of the terror radius as a survivor it isn't that bad.
---
no
---
Try Adept idiot, random killer then another killers teachables only.
---
If you feel you're getting genrushed that's your own fault.
---
T. 1k hour Doc main
---
imagine bullying a new killer and posting it on reddit via shitty quality to try to get ego points
---
Pffft DS in 2019, it’s not like you can just not tunnel the guy who got unhooked
---
I've played killer for a long time and corn has always been one of the hardest obsticales for tall killers
---
Hopefully the rework fixes this!
---
And everyone usually makes 20k+ base score in doctor games if they don't play like babies.
---
Fucking had that happen last night. All of a sudden boop, the last 3 survivors gone.
---
As long as they don't nerf him like they did legion then we'll be good
---
I personally like Enduring
---
enduring,spirit fury
---
upvoted since someone downvoted
---
Clown's thighs
---
Enduring is all around pretty solid and even stronger with spirit fury.
---
Love it, I need this on my (html) body! Does anyone knows who the artist is?
---
The OP post was about crutch perks, so I assumed it's kinda logical to think the answer about survivor-sided perks would be a relevant comeback. 
---
I'm smoking grape-flavoured vape, in case you're really interested in that.
---
I chuckled. Thanks OP
---
I hate playing against legion, I know it's just in my head because after his rework he is more balanced and fair but he still feels bad to play against for me.
---
Some people like me still think that sadly. I will never bm or salt message unless the killer warrants it. Just gg and move on
---
Hahaha glad you had fun, np bro
---
Love it as killer, hate it as survivor. If you don't luck out and find hatch first, your dead. Killer can also close hatch while you are jumping in which is extremely frustrating.
---
We here use € and the symbol usually comes after the number - I just exchange the € with $ because otherwise muricans get easily confused.     
---
You seem to hate yourself a lot if you play a game for 120 hours that you seem to hate so much.
---
Dont get it

Last night I was being camped with the hex totem right in front of me, I repeatedly told my friends to leave as there was nothing they could do. Killer got a 3k instead of 1k. My friends are dumb.
---
Well if you didn't want to die, you maybe should have considered leaving rather than going for the save.
---
And the killers now are doing the same.
---
You don’t deserve to do this and then complain about holding the game hostage.
---
(Not referring to you but to those people that says “survivor were toxic so now we ruin the game for those who weren’t”)
---
But is it worth it bringing Enduring by itself?
---
I think they know he is low on a tier list so want to balance him, whereas legion on console was a problem so nerfing to balance him. I think he's fairer now but I agree he was nerfed
---
"As my sweet mother always said 'Son, if one dead survivor is good, two are better, and three, well, that's just good business' "
---
The only time I'm actively hoping the killer will be a nurse.
---
Those are just my assumptions on why I don't have that kind of issues but you have. I don't really have any different though, if you think your timing of hits is perfect during these moments, then either I have a better luck or I really don't know wtf is the difference.
---
He looks like shrek
---
Someone needs to down vote this so it’s 76 likes
---
&gt; If you could only choose one
---
Spirit Fury if level 3. Enduring if not.
---
Fire Up is inherently bad as you are already losing by the time it truly 'activates'.
---
The update made corn incredibly less laggy and easier to track survivors in corn for me. It was like night and day.
---
It’s not deserved for those who never did that. 
---
People should try to be more mature and think that if they did the same that doesn’t make them better than the other person.
---
But I think I’m asking too much for a video game.
---
The stealth lasts as long as he is not “spotted” or seen by a survivors in which case it will then start to rapidly drain
---
He even has an addon effecting how far people can “spot” him from
---
Yeah, I guess it has happened to me one to many times and I had to rant about it for a while. What killers do you usually play? Maybe it also depends by the killers. I could see how somehow who mostly plays Myers, Wraith, Pig or Hillbilly could have less problems with Borrowed Time than I do.
---
It could be placeholder stuff
---
Well, since hatch grabs are removed now anyway, I think this shows perfectly that he clearly is the best at preventing hatch escape ;)

---
On a serious note, as a red rank Freddy main, all the said disadvantages are true. At the same time, he is a lot stronger then most people give him credit for, and the only good perk he has for himself is Remember me, with Blood Warden being pretty rarely useful. Against common topics, Freddy is not a endgame killer. As long as all doors are closed, he is super strong, but as soon as a door is open, you have basically lost. He is strongest in his midgame, when he repeatedly sleeps survivors for the stall and information. He is a lot of fun, and if you play killer, I suggest everyone to actually try and learn how he plays.
---
I mean Fire Up seems like an ok perk since it speeds multiple actions up, why does it "suck"?
---
Its either I pip or I don’t pip
---
I think the GG and move on is always the way to go-- even after bad matches. That's what I do on both sides, because I don't want my words to actually hurt someone. :( 
---
That said, I get it. I still dread seeing them. But after playing him I feel a bit less angry about them!
---
Saying gg on Xbox is better for that reason or PlayStation but I don’t like PlayStation they deleted my games off the console
---
Probably, but it takes longer to complete them by gen tapping. And tbh Overcharge and Ruin are only good if the survivors can't hit the skill checks.
---
Do you respect pallets?
---
Oh yeah, it mitigates decisive and head on. Also if you can get a hit at a pallet it basically acts as a Save The Best for Last full stack hit where the Enduring stun overrides the wipe animation.
---
If you get hit with pallet a lot - enduring, if not - strength. Bamboozle is generally very good, and I would rather use it
---
Spirit fury + enduring is the strongest chase perk combination in the game but if you can't have both choose enduring. Spirit fury is useless without it.
---
Probably because he looks like a fucking potato haha #quintgang
---
Enduring &gt; Bamboozle &gt; Spirit Fury &gt; Brutal &gt; Fire Up.
---
Not enough players, like with every other "alternative gamemode" ideas
---
The benefits aren't even that great and they don't even become noticeable until all generators are done and even then it still is unlikely to get you any kills.
---
Brutal strength Because it's always active and I love the pallet breaking animation. Run it on all my builds with STBFL
---
Legion wasn't nerfed though.. Plus It will be hard to make Freddy worse
---
No,  noed gives movement speed, it’s rather op
---
He has a glory hole for a mouth
---
As a killer = Claudette cause she is the most likely being toxic
---
As survivor = Claudette cause she is the most likely to let me die while urban evading away
---
Unfortunately Legion is going to be forever tainted because of what he once was, people are always going to hate him.
---
Pip can refer to a small dot or seed. The dots on a die are pips, and the symbols in the center of a playing card are also pips. So I guess it's used similarly here.
---
Maybe...?
---
*laughs in trapper with tar bottle*
---
I'm fine with it if it just spawns, but if both know were it is before the other surv. dies... you are "omae wa mou shindeiru".
---
You should refer to /r/AmItheAsshole and get evaluated. 
---
I don't know if these Survivors did this with malicious intend, the video doesn't show any signs of this. What you did in any case was pretty toxic imo. I mean you got unhooked eventually. I know it's annoying and pretty bad to let you dangle for a whole stage but I don't even know their ranks. Maybe they are just bad players?
---
If it a camping Bubba, I’d rather DC as well.
---
Except Exit Gate spawns should never favour of the killer.
---
The amount of times I've reached the end of the match with one other survivor only for the killer to camp the doors since they spawned along the same wall with 0 visual obstructions between them.
---
Doonkay!
---
Mind sharing them at r/PerkByDaylight ?
---
The problem with that is when 1 Dull Totem is super Hidden. You don't know if they have Noed. Are you gonna throw the game just to find that Noed or just risk the Noed and run to the exit gates.
---
Noed isnt necessary at all in any Killers. Ok Freddy is nrcessary. I am not saying u cant take it, play as u want end game build whatevs, but it has too many upsides than downsides
---
That is because you are in 4vs1, of course it would seem OP if you met 4 survivors with the same perks, but they really aren’t.
---
I don’t run MoM so I can’t say anything on that but Adrenaline and BT aren’t op at all.
---
It’s like saying Noed is op
---
If there’s only one survivor left alive, they have lost, they hatch or the door is meant as a lucky slight chance of escape, they are not entitled to escape like they have been for the past 2 years, 
---
But yes if people are going to whine and cry they could spread the gates out more to help, but that’s it’s nothing else to nerf end game, they lost.
---
NSFW is never too late 😩👌🏿
---
Maybe your just bad then.
---
With that they might as well bump it back to to three minutes again. 
---
No !
---
Nah, I'm not sitting through 7 minutes of misery, knowing I've already lost before the game began. I'll take the DC and move on.
---
Even if spirit fury is okay on its own it doesn't compare to enduring. It cuts decisive stuns in half and not to mention you can swing through most pallets without consequence.
---
Enduring
---
Yea but I don't know why people DC VS legion I mean.
---
How is the OP post about crutches? The only crutch in that is NOED. Maybe check your vape pen again...
---
When Pig's The Game map first came out, survivors ALL DCed like fucking babies until BHVR added in a bunch of safe pallets and people discovered Balanced Landing.
---
Start to play small game and cleanse totems... No more ruin, no more NOED
---
If your the last one alive, you lost, your not entitled to escape, as you say it’s luck and it should be luck.
---
Thanks Kayauce! Never woulda noticed. I always keep my camera swivelling. Never look at the BP Im getting.
---
1. Survivors are a *team*. If your *team* failed to get the gens done before 3 of you are sacrificed, they have lost. The hatch is a second chance.
---
2. If at least 3 gens are done, you can find the hatch while the Killer's busy. If not, the Killer can't *know* where the hatch is, giving you a chance.
---
3. You can use a key on the hatch or use Wake Up!
---
4. Since the hatch can spawn with 0 gens done, you can spend more time helping your team. If less than 3 gens are done, the Killer cannot "go directly to the hatch".
---
No they get more points for booking and killing you, that killer is misinformed.
---
Lol, I like how you say it won't be a good match and the best argument against that is "but he's so bad you are going to win easily if you are any good," as if that somehow makes the match good.
---
I'll check it of course, but meanwhile: how is Ruin not a crutch? And lets be honest, BBQ is a crutch for grinding.
---
Edit: I feel disturbance in you. Maybe you should smoke sum too? :)
---
Sometimes it’s bad for the killer too. I’ve had more survivors escape with this new change then I had before. I used to just try and kill everyone before they did two gens so the hatch wouldn’t even spawn; zero chance of survival. Now I’ve had a bunch of games where they get 1 or zero gens completed and they escape. It’s mainly because they find the hatch first or I close it and they’ve already opened the exit gate on the other side of the map by the time I get there. As a survivor I like the change, majority of the time it works in my favor (tbh, a lot of escape that I didn’t deserve). As a killer I dislike it because it causes a lot of survivors to escape that wouldn’t have with the old hatch. I would be okay with your suggestion as long as it only happened if there were at least two gens completed (maybe decrease the timer by 2 or 3 seconds for every gen completed). Then again if you did do something like that then it would be a free escape if the exit gates spawn far away from the hatch/away from each other. As it is now killers get screwed over for being a good killer. I thought the new hatch system was supposed to make it so survivors didn’t have a free escape(and to get rid of hatch stand offs), but it seems like now it’s more RNG about where the hatch and exit gates spawn.  
---
Edit- A lot of people don’t seem to understand what the hatch is. It’s not supposed to be a free escape for the last survivor. It’s supposed to offer the last survivor hope of survival. If survivors fail to do all five gens then you lost the match, you’re not supposed to be rewarded for that. IMO the hatch should be in the killers favor, but right now it’s a coin toss about where everything spawns.
---
Really was just a lucky map with a lucky killer. Stupid Pig still terrifies me though popping out of the woodworks at the most inconvenient times.
---
Tbf, Ash was revealed at a convention. Ghostface getting a "and it's available... RIGHT NOW!" announcement would cause a massive explosion of downloads.
---
Point in Progress
---
u/richardcs2 killer was on me WHOLE game so I couldn’t rescue for obvious reasons. I only got one gen done before he found me
---
To be fair, if you run Lightborn and Overwhelming Presence, flashlights become much less of a problem.
---
Mettle works but only if you are injured as the perk says. If you are full health you will go down even if mettle is ready to use
---
I got a profanity laced message yesterday because I played steamers and got an easy 4k. Apparently I'm selfish for not farming but I don't have time for that stupid shit.
---
When I get facecamped I just sit there on the hook for as long as I possibly can. You wanna sit and stare at me while gens are getting repaired? Be my guest. I’ll take it as a compliment that you want to look at me for so long :’)
---
"I'm not gonna kill an already injured person, what do you think I am ? A monster ? A coward ?"
---
That Josuke's logic right there... He heal his opponents to beat him up because he was alread at the hospital...
---
Then your version of fun is pretty toxic because you effectively prevent someone from being able to play the game in the first place.
---
Aw, Plague Teachables are neat, especially Infectous Fright. It's such a fun perk.
---
- Surviving for all 5 gens &amp; an exit gate opening while I was Dying Light. Killer got me in the end, but it didn't matter because everyone else got out.
---
- Having a daily to unhook people as Dwight before I had any perks on Dwight, ran back in from the exit I'd just opened to unhook a Meg hooked by shack by a Myers. Got her, took the hit since I didn't have BT... which unfortunately for me was the first hit after he reached tier 3. She sprinted away and out the exit, and I was left to crawl. Myers walked past me a handful of times without seeing me &amp; then the hatch opened in front of me, I escaped.
---
Sometimes I run NOED with Wraith. Am I someone to hate? Honestly idk, because I get flamed for it a lot but sometimes Adrenaline fucks me so much that I like to have something against it. It's a shame that I have to take out spirit's fury for that when I run it tho.
---
me_irl
---
Obviously fake but if they did release a BP for the game I’d buy it instantly.
---
Could even give it a clever name; The Hunter’s Almanac maybe.
---
even the entity is a memer
---
Borrowed time and Metal of man have the same effect (endurance) the Endurance status effect grants the next time you would be put into the dying state is ignored and you are granted the usual burst of speed after a hit. Borrowed time puts you into the deep wound status effect and Metal of man just ignores the next hit that would put you into the dying state and once you heal up your Aura is shown to the killer while you are x meters away from the killer.
---
If you are fully healed with Mettle of Man activated, then any perk/ability that gives the exposed effect will down you. However, if you're injured with MoM activated, then you'll absorb whatever hits you next regardless of what it is (M1 attack, chainsaw, hatchet, NOED, etc).
---
The incentive is that you can and likely will be saved from the hook if you're first hooked, giving you the opportunity for more points.  Altruism rarely falls apart that early in a game - if and when it does, it's once two or three gens have popped and you suddenly discover you're with three stealth Claudettes working separate gens all willy-nilly when one could stand to mount a rescue attempt
---
Unless of course, you're being facecamped, and if you're the first one hooked and already getting facecamped, I wouldn't worry: that killer is leaving with a displeased Entity, no doubt about it.  It sounds like semantics, but if I'm getting facecamped, I refuse to DC, kill myself on hook, or even stop struggling, because at that point I'm dedicated to furious solidarity, and more time with a killer trying to 'secure the kill' early game means the far more likely it is he's about to get gen rushed.  If I die first, I still can drop out of the game altogether for a bit or just get to move to a new, hopefully better game sooner, and that's incentive enough for me.  It's only an extra two minutes
---
I like how u assume that. I don't have a main, I play both equally it just depends what I feel like playing at the time. Both my survivor and killer ranks are the same. 
---
But I'm guessing since ur calling me a survivor main just cause I'm saying both sides CAN be toxic then u must be a killer main urself just seeking an excuse to call someone out and be a troll.
---
If that is the case then it definitely does sound like it would be fun to use. I just assumed that you would make his cloak function in the same way as the wraith.
---
I have the same issue lol. I either use just Brutal Strength or Enduring with it.
---
That's not what I was commenting for.
---
It's to correct the nonsense that only 2 killers proc the perk.
---
I just made myself sad by thinking of a chapter with Clem the Survivor and &gt;!Zombie Lee!&lt; the Killer..
---
I agree, but not just in the sense of EGC. I had a match recently (a day or two before the EGC patch dropped) on a Coldwind map where the killer facecamped a hook that was square in the middle of both doors &amp; could see both exits, there weren't any jungle gym tiles or anything that obscured him from having a perfect view of both exits. Anyone who tried to leave was downed and hooked, and our last teammate stayed on the total opposite side of the map camping hatch while the rest of us were all dying trying to get an escape.
---
I honestly hate the new hatch changes, chances are if the killer closes the hatch you’re basically fucked.
---
Hate it so much and feel survivors should be able to perform an action that takes say 5-10 seconds to reopen it without having to use a key.
---
As it stands if I end up in collapse with the hatch shut and a choice of 2 gates I just DC, you have no chance of opening either gates before the killer comes round and if they spot you you’re done anyway.
---
Love the idea, hating the current execution has made survivor an absolute chore
---
I troll a lot. I don't actually think most killers are trash (except low rank nurses). But I'll still salt the chat with "GG EZ" or "tutorial killer". Most of the time I've been killed anyway so if they don't see it as an obvious joke, then I don't even know.
---
There are much better uses for an entire perk slot if all you care about is +4% movespeed after every gen is done
---
You're telling me that a survivor should automatically lose because they had 3 potatoes? I would rather have hatch standoff back again.
---
But doesn’t work both ways ? Your complaining and trying to stop me from playing the game ?
---
Also if you didn't know, if you are fully healed (via we'll make it/adrenaline/intsa heal etc.) and you still have say 5 seconds of borrowed time left. If the killer has any type of exposed status effect you will ignore the down and be put into the deep wound status effect. Metal of man requires you to be injured.
---
Unless it’s been changed a killer can grab a survivor during the unhook process, unless they let go to take the hit and unhook while the killer is wiping the blade?
---
“And yeah it is easy to counter BT-bodyblock by just aiming at the right person and waiting a bit for the unhooked person to run away” this makes it sound like you don’t play killer
---
I'll never know either!
---
*Inserts picture of Bear Trap instead of Balanced Landing*
---
Exactly and all it does is annoy ppl and make the gap between survivors and killers bigger. Tbh idk why ppl act superior, if it wasn't for perks and add ons/items ppl wouldn't be as "good" as they are.
---
*HOWLS WITH LAUGHTER IN IRIDESCENT STONE*
---
I know, I just wanna p3 other killers and learn for them the perks I need on them specifically, and new teachables only make it harder. I can't even start on how much it cost me to learn BBQ on my Nurse, jeez
---
See I didn't know about Capcom doing that. Ty for proving me wrong. I dunno, a Pred would be a bit much. Cần turn invisible, has claws, has a shoulder blaster, cần attack from being invisible. Would be a bit much.
---
Personally rather have Clem from the Walking Dead. I agree with the Thing but having him as a paragraph survivor would be sweet.
---
I really appreciate it. With more people like you bullying rank 15, driving people away from the game and **actually cutting into the dev's profits**, maybe we'll finally see a fix for the ranking system.
---
I want this help
---
Cant wait for Killer vs Survivor comments 
---
Dbd Flame wars are not a escape
---
&gt;So would you rec Spirit Fury over Enduring? I actually don't have Enduring yet but I have BS, Bamboozle and SF so I wasnt sure if I needed it
---
I guess it depends on how you play. Some people like to semi respect pallets to avoid getting stunned. Other people respect pallets a lot by taking a few steps back.
---
My way of playing is never letting go of W, which means I get stunned a lot so SFury comes in handy even without Enduring.
---
I dislike Enduring outside of the combo with Spirit Fury. I honestly don't think is that good now that DS has been reworked.
---
Yep, I've gotten stuck somewhere similar before. I was loading into a match and didn't ever see the campfire, but the match apparently loaded while I was stuck [here](https://i.imgur.com/dNrfU5W.jpg) for more than three minutes. Closed the app &amp; reopened and had lost two pips for the DC even though I literally couldn't have played the game.
---
And you get a splitter. That's when a skill check appears so the generator blows up when you pull away.
---
To be fair if you died and you typed that post game they probably just think you’re salty that you died instead of seeing it as a joke.
---
Hahaha, how are these made?
---
When I say GG after a game when I died the killer just leaves without saying anything... I don't get that
---
Never add in assumptions to an argument.
---
I play fairly, and it's quite common for adren to proc on who ever you are chasing, be it with 2 already dead, or nobody dead. It's still really bogus that they made a handful of perks directly counter Freddy, and a bunch of the killer perks are pointless on him, like mad grit and overcharge.
---
well than that game has also a bad Match making
---
Exactly. That's one of the lots of bad designs in this game...  
---
"Oh, your only ability is to be invisible? Well, fuck you."
---
Survivors can ritualistically dc over old Legion, but killers can't dc over a map that regularly has infinites
---
lol
---
I'd just like to mention that i don't use ruin, not because it's annoying, but because... I CONSIDER IT JUST A BAD &amp; INCONSISTE............\*gets stabbed by fifteen dead women called sally, 17 inbred hicks &amp; 2 vapey bois while someone in a pig mask, a white mask, another guy in a white mask &amp; one shimmery boi, watch\*
---
What stereotype were they trying to avoid?
---
You're aware that you're defending DCing while calling people fucking babies that do it, right?
---
What a fake gamer girl, Susie should know that minecraft characters don't have fingers, geez.
---
It generally takes longer than 20 seconds to walk between exits on most of the maps unless they spawn close enough together which is extremely rare especially on some of the larger maps like Mt Ormond. 
---
The best way I’ve managed to escape is as the last person dies on hook, to be close to an exit to try and open as soon as the killer closes the hatch and hope they check the other door first or don’t make it to your door in time; or hiding by an exit until they check it and open it if they leave to check the other door or stealth to the other door if they hang around the other.
---
Check out this link! I think it’ll help you out a lot. https://youtu.be/KjWLd5D5mqE  it compares the normal heal time to a bunch of different factors. This guy is worth subscribing to, he helps me out a lot with questions like this.
---
When I got Leatherface to P3 during the Winter Solstice in 2017, he was my first killer I got to P3 and it was a really good moment for me.
---
Never should favour the killer?! 
---
You must have some sense of empathy, both sides have to have a chance.
---
If two survivors died, and it was left only two as well, its 50/50, if it favours the survivors, gg, if it favours the killer gg, it doesnt matter if your side wasn't the favoured, its just RNG
---
Why does Shrek look like someone is about to go for the unsafe hook? 🤔 🤔 🤔
---
They should make the bar change colour when it's 100% tbh, it'd make it way clearer when the exact right time to let go would be
---
You are nice for survivors, but survivors will never be nice to you, they only want to win so 
---
##USE THEM DEVOUR HOPE, RUIN, OP ADD-ONS AND PERKS.
---
I don't get it
---
Ok, the only time when this is a problem is when you close the hatch with 1 surv left &amp; in that case, well whoever finds the hatch first; wins. the last person doesn't get a secured victory by not dying
---
Insert Mr. X Streets of Rage 2 laugh.
---
athletic black girl and nerdy white girl i assume
---
You absolutely shouldn't be entitled to a free escape, but you should have a chance, which currently is beyond minimal. I say that as both a killer main and rank 1 survivor.
---
Your statement is extremely killer biased.
---
I'm sorry you had to find out this way...
---
Such a toxic killer *Teabags*
---
I don’t want a secured victory for either side, just fairer door spawns
---
Yes, those are obviously just salty survivors. Learn the difference between actual valid complaints and salt. It's not all black and white.
---
This is always brought up and the answer remains the same: Only punish people who do this regularly. If you hit a threshold of lets say 4 disconnects in a 3 day period, you get hit with a penalty.   
---
If your internet is that unstable, that's unfortunate for you but you end up screwing the people you're playing with and it should be addressed before you continue to play.
---
Username...checks out??
---
People who think DBD is au per toxic are soft as hell. The amount of trash talking is minimal and relatively inoffensive at best. 
---
You'll never understand the discomfort of sitting in a Promod/Rocket Arena lobby as two guys really go off.
---
Ashes to ashes.
---
It depends on what exactly you mean by trash talk. If you mean simply saying oh you suck killer, hit gud, then, yes that kind of banter is okay and shouldn’t be taken seriously. If you mean telling someone they should kill themselves by drinking bleach or calling them a derogatory slur as retaliation for losing then I’m not sure if anyone should find that kind of banter acceptable.
---
Mettle to mettle
---
Then BHVR should just go ahead and have the Entity sacrifice the last survivor on the map if the intention was for the killer to win after closing it.
---
I somehow got 20k points and a pip idk how but I had dealt with 4 legions and a Basement Bubba in a row so I figured it was toxic Monday.
---
WHOOSH straight over your head
---
Doubtful, but even if she did im not sure the red forest is a good place to be, especially when starving and with big mommy on your tail. Plot armor can only do so much.
---
I play killer a lot and I will typically let 1 person live, if the survs get 4-5 gens and I get 2-3 kills I’m usually netting 25k points. 
---
It’s Survive With Friends just ruins the fun for me.
---
Every time they are the ones just literally ruining the experience. 
---
4 man instant heal w/self care, 4 man flash lights.
---
The infinite T-Bagging, People trying to body block hooks, you can also swarm a killer and they CANNOT drop a surv. Resulting in the surv wiggling free and essentially getting a free heal. 
---
Literally stopped playing for 2 weeks after that shit. 
---
If you play a game vs a Killer and they ruthlessly slaughter you all as quickly as possible using strong add ons it’s probs my because they are pissed about a previous SWF game. 
---
It would be much more simple if there was ranked/unranked no premades for ranked games.
---
Wait, for real? Do you have a link or something? I've been too paranoid to use these dope perks I've been seeing.
---
I'd put leatherface there, Freddy is a higher to lower end mid teir killer once you master him.
---
Found another condescending dbag!
---
I get some of the best comments/worst insults as he depression.
---
This picture is so accurate it makes me sad.
---
Just keep scrolling it's not hard...
---
looks very good
---
Ya. It’s almost as if escaping is more difficult for the survivor that failed the trial. Crazy concept right?
---
Instead of nurse's calling, i use distressing or blood warden for that sweet endgame
---
Assume much?
---
Survivor: ThE kILLeR iS ToXIc

I genuinely felt bad when reading it then seeing the baby’s face 😂😂😂😥
---
Buddy it's a meme lol

Cursed.image.exe
---
Not upset I didn’t survive, upset the perks didn’t do their job 
---
I’m assuming youre a killer who face camps and took offense to this. I apologize for my rude post.
---
Fire up is an OP crutch, don't use it.  
---
This is so sad, can we nerf Fire up?
---
Ohhhh right
---
I'm not surprised they both proc'd at the same time. If they didn't that would be incredibly unbalanced.
---
Why wouldn't they activate at the same time? They both give the endurance buff or whatever it is called. They both activate the same way (getting whacked, technically they activate a lil differently since MoM wouldn't activate on a chainsaw or something but they both still activate on a basic attack). Seems like you did the equivalent of running two exhaustion perks and wondered why it didn't work. Consider it a learning experience. At least now in the future you know.
---
I'm with the 3 minute thing 2 minutes isnt enough time to save and what not.
---
Well what do you know? It works.
---
Quality shitpost.
---
Some people are just rude... you were being a team player.. killer mains are just dickwads on reddit...
---
Rocks are the survivors way of telling the killer to dc
---
you know is like an onion that's one of the layers

Huh... i uh... need to level up my Freddy... for reasons... those being A i dont have any perks on him &amp; B... well... from what we saw with pig being able to slow down the endgame, im guessing sharp hand joe isn't gonna slow surv objectives in his rework
---
Why are you talking about Jeff designing Legion’s mask?
---
good they got what they deserved they knew the other guy got downed and still didn't come to get saved him instead
---
Nurse is killing the game, just saying
---
Counter play is non M1 killers. Not justifying it, cause it’s stupid strong. Never was a DS person
---
Op made post on post. I apparently didn't hit the respond directly button.
---
Mmhmm
---
Always gonna do it. If I’m not having fun why should I stay in the match?
---
If he did tho..
---
Where did you get that the post is about crutch perks?
---
Truth.
---
Here's a man who gets it! Sure some people find it unfun, but when you realize that your not trapped their with them, but instead they're trapped their with you... well, it gets a lot better
---
Um sheltered woods is a killer sided map.. like 6 pallets no place to use bl properly, lots and lots of open space.
---
Not that simple in most cases... first of all body blocking is real, second all BT does is put both survivors at the same health state most of the time.
---
There’s no master Freddy, he is garbage. He has no chase power, can’t camp, etc.
---
Why is Tapp down there?
---
Serves them right
---
I love haddonfield especially against a bubba.. I can run him for a while lol..  but I've gotten my ass handed to me plenty of times on that map.  It's not the map that sucks it's just the gamer behind the killer who sucks...
---
Omg thats what I just said. Theres like 6 pallets and tons of open space and no where to really use bl.
---
Only pussies use noEd tbh. NoEd = you get flamed.
---
Please explain to me how is it easier to go for the unhooker? IF he has BT all it does most of the time is make both survivors need 2 hits to down (excluding MoM which is a BS perk)
---
if i ever see'em in my lobby.... he... hehe... hehahahaha.... waahahahahahahahahhaha... WAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA(ivory mori floats in from backround)
---
You don’t have many choices with this map sadly other than playing dirty. 
---
Option one: play Trapper or Hag.
---
Option two: hope the survivors are really bad.
---
Option three: get someone in the basement and proxy camp. 
---
Option four: slug like your life depends on it.
---
Anytime I can make a killer dc!! Its a successful match
---
still waiting for youtube to get the Jimmy stream... first stream i caught &amp; was not disappointed
---
I mean, I'm gay, but I actually got into the game because I've just been a big fan of horror films and video games since I was about 12-13. I like the fact that you can dress up your characters, but I started playing quite a while before the cosmetic shop was introduced. I'm also not one of the gays that keeps screaming for a shirtless Myers, jockstrap Trapper or assless chaps Freddy.
---
Always say gg even if I die to bs hitboxes and lag.
---
Only don't say it if they're toxic (facecamping and such)
---
It is not. 
---
Plenty of places to juke. God shack is near centralized. Not a lot of unsafe pallets.
---
Oh wow, thanks a lot! I had no clue about that
---
I just had a huntress Dc on me so this is the biggest mood lmao
---
I’ve seen one called Hex: Puppet = Hatch
---
Errrrgh that’s one destroyed arm.
---
I mean you had your chance to find the hatch i found you first.
---
\*sips tea\* ok... o-HOL' THE FUCK UP
---
Bodyblocking is real yeah, but it's real regardless who you are hitting. It doesn't change the math here
---
&gt;  BT does is put both survivors at the same health state most of the time 
---
Not exactly. You can hit the unhooked person only after they are, well, unhooked. And you can hit the unhooker before that, and after that. So time-wise and considering attack cooldown the unhooked person with BT actually has 1 health state more than the unhooker.
---
Yeah I fear that‘s the case. Maybe I‘ll start to write down how many I got after a game and If I get to 50 without getting it, something is wrong..
---
The effects are minimal from what I know. Most Plague addons have minimal effects and only matter when stacked. Even when stacking both corrupt movement speed addons you barely feel it. I do sorta feel however the vile purge charge movement speed.
---
This could be good and bad bc i could see bad players not noticing how close they were reving up their chainsaw and accidentally using it when they dont want to
---
Alright, thanks for your reply!
---
My point is he used a perk, so what are we just banning perks from the game now?
---
It would stop people just face camping and holding the saw,
---
Did you see what the number is on PS4? It'll say in the achievement list. Also, maybe No Mither doesn't work. Maybr the broken status effect screws it over.
---
I love this
---
“This is kinda cringy”
---
looks very cool, especially the doctor ones
---
Neither did OP
---
why'd he delete it
---
Why not just let the Killer or collapse kill you? That way you can keep your points and there’s no risk of being banned in the future.
---
You're telling me a Killer isn't allowed to get a 4k just because 3 of the Survivors are bad?
---
Or are you telling me a Survivor is entitled to win if their team is bad? Is that how other multiplayer games work?
---
Besides, before EGC, you literally couldn't escape if less than 2 gens were done. Now you at least have a *chance*.
---

Enduring. Breaking pallets is something you can do more selectively - some pallets you can play survivors on, sometimes they just keep running. But trying to avoid getting pallet-stunned will often cost you more time than any of these perks make up for, if the survivor is good enough to abuse your pallet respect. Granted, ever since the pallet vacuum was removed, you can respect pallets just enough to still regularly avoid the stun without losing so much distance that the survivor can make it back around the loop, but this only regularly goes for simple loops, and simple pallet play. Good survivors can fake or bait the pallet drop, into faking or baiting it again, into actually dropping it or running, and it can and will cost you. Then there are also pallets where Line-of-Sight is broken, allowing the survivor to surprise-stun you with double-back drops. There are also late-drops where the survivor will use the whole pallet pull prompt range to get stuns in. Besides, the simple ability to swing or walk through pallets without it coming at a risk just allows you to play more recklessly, such as using red stain mindgames and surprise lunges, and especially with killer latency advantage, land some pretty nasty hits through pallet drops in general. Plus, with Spirit Fury being a thing, its mere existence will caution survivors to drop pallets early if you have Enduring, even if you don't run Fury, and early pallet drops obviously benefit you as killer. With Enduring in play, in most scenarios dropping the pallet early instead of playing for stuns is the play for survivors, since stunning you nets them next to no additional distance (exceptions are when playing around killer abilities like chainsaws or hatchets). Bottom line: Against good survivors, Enduring will have more value than Brutal Strength. Additionally, if you eat the stun *and* break the pallet, Enduring will be more raw time saved on the total duration of those two actions combined than Brutal Strength. And then there's the Decisive Strike (and Head On) thing, as well as those rare but glorious situations in which a survivor stuns you while on the same side of the pallet, allowing you to immediately hit or grab them.
---
Brutal Strength is still a pretty good chase perk, considering the time and therefore distance it saves you, and, to be fair, many or most survivors you will meet in public play are not very good, and so respecting pallets just enough will usually be something you can do. And then there are some killers that can tactically respect pallets or force early drops - namely Clown, Plague, Myers, and Huntress - and on those there can be an argument for Brutal over Enduring. Of course, you will also not seldomly be able to play worse survivors on safer pallets, and there are also killers that benefit from Enduring more (such as Billy, Leatherface, Doctor and Legion), and so there's that.
---
Bamboozle is sort of in a league of its own, given that it can be much more significant of a time saver than any of the other chase perks particularly when looking at long-wall windows, but since it makes kites automatically more pallet-heavy and reduces many tiles to more or less simply pallet loops, using it without an accompanying pallet perk can actually backfire. Many of the windows that are not long-wall windows can actually be used to mindgame  survivors and get hits off of it, and so simplifying these tiles into pallet loops can end up costing you more time than it would have if you had tried to play the survivor on the vaults. Then again, really good survivors will definitely use more windows than pallets in their kites, and do so in ways that trying to mindgame can also backfire, and so against them I'd say Bamboozle can be more impactful than either Enduring or Brutal Strength. Pallets are a finite resource whereas vaults are not, after all.
---
Spirit Fury is only ever worth it with Enduring, I think. Only then is it basically a guaranteed hit (or down, on various killers). Plus, without that interaction, it is hard to justify using Fury, given that it can only at best break every third pallet, and also has counterplay. Even in games where I use it with Enduring, it does not proc a whole lot, so if those procs would not even guarantee me hits and downs, it would be even less valuable than it already is, compared to the consistent value Brutal, Enduring and Bamboozle all provide you with.
---
Freddy has become my favorite killer over the past week or so. Instead of getting looped and frustrated all game I've been bouncing around and basically getting free first hits, then returning and getting the down. It's a bit weird adapting an entirely different play style and basically abandoning chases after the first hit every time, but matches feel so much more satisfying now.
---
Either that or if you have time for lunge. Unhook animation takes some time, and most of the time you can see them running to the hook
---
They wont change it till a year from now. Its making them money so who cares.
---
It works fine on Xbox
---
That's not really a problem with Hillbilly players so I don't think it would matter all that much with Leatherface.
---
Or smarter that you thought, but you just can't grasp it. Who knows, right?
---
I meant its good way to compile everything so the devs can find it easier
---
I sometimes play nurse on PS4 with controller it’s only really the FPS that makes it hard but if you can predict surv movements she becomes a bit easier
---
What about killers taking you hostage? You can do nothing but dc.
---
If hillbilly fucks up a chainsaw he gets penalized worse than if leatherface does. Leatherface has to wait out his whole animation compared to billy having a much shorter animation to deal with.
---
&gt;billy and huntress all ignore it. 
---
If you know how to play, no they don't. 
---
Against Billy all that you need is a LT wall loop, jungle gym or pallet. Keep vaulting LT over and over until they give up trying to M2 and end up using M1. Unless they waste time waiting for the opportunity to M2. Same goes for pallets, just keep looping and they will M1 or waste time. 
---
Against Huntress literally any object can be used to negate her M2. If you find a rock, just keep running around it until she gives up and M1 you. 
---
I am yet to struggle getting my MoM stacks against these two characters.
---
on the other side of things, the survivor that DCs, even if they do so after being grabbed at the end of a game during a hatch jump, loses out on any points they would have gained.
---
People are just weird.
---
just because its repetitive doesn't mean you should be able to dc
---
Bruh, what speed boost? He is in the unhooking animation during my hit cooldown. His speed boost will work only if he gave up on unhooking the survivor.
---
Cmon, I don't facecamp and it works in most cases. It it's that hard to come there in time for hitting unhooker twice, I must be some sort of genius, and probably it's not really like that
---

Me making a comment doesn't somehow prevent you from being able to play the game, lol. No this is not equivalent.
---
Ok. Do the other items stack? NONE of them say stacks.
---
He is talking about Jeff the Killer, you know the creepypasta guy. At least I think
---
It's really a shame. :(
---
Pig can use ambush dashes and gen grabs to play around MOM, to an extent.
---
He meant Jeff the Killer
---
You seem to be missing my point though.
---
No, but you want me to play the game a certain way, not the way I want to play it.
---
There would be no need for juggling the bar with Bubba. The reason you need to juggle with Hillbilly is because you move so fast and barely get to turn, you have to make sure your chainsaw is headed to the survivor when the bar goes full, unlike with Bubba. If you start revving up your chainsaw as Bubba, you want the bar to get full as fast as possible so you're caught up with the survivor and don't waste time slowly walking and revving the chainsaw. You can turn just as well as the survivor, that's not a problem like with Billy. Juggling wouldn't be necessary. Just holding the button down would without having to let go would benefit the killer in pretty much every situation
---
Ooh god all this time I played  with and M1 killer and didn't realise I just need to play with a killer I don't wanna play with to counter 1 perk! Thanks for the advise
---
Oh, no I do not know lol I have no idea who Jeff the killer is
---
whats your point then?
---
You're Good Shrek. I'm Bad Shrek!
---
So pretty much this. https://imgur.com/a/i4slLrQ
---
A lot of 4 mans are so easy to take down. Find the weak link and they will practically hook themselves. Also, it's just more fun to play with friends. It's not realistic to think that people who play SWF will not communicate with each other. You might as well just play solo in that case.
---
U teabagged him at the gate cause u knew u had mom n u were trolling him the whole game, I main survivor n I dont think the killer really did anything except maybe camp u at the end but u were trolling him.
---
Oh well it's just a guy who burned himself and he cut a smile in his face and started killing people who were awake but in bed and then he said "go to sleep" or something, it's stupid but I like the drawings of him.
---
Gen grabs aren’t reliable and the dashes suck most of the time. It’s faster and sneakier to uncrouch and attack. Nothing screams sneaky like the obnoxiously loud roar that alerts the survivors.
---
Legion is oddly okay now. They are just average now. The addons are mostly useless now though because 4 second fatigue lmao.
---
It's one extra hit, meanwhile NOED ignores an extra hit
---
I see, but it’s just another post moaning about camping/tunnelling/SWF to me, we have enough of these.
---
I think they do. Behavior is really bad at being consistent with that. I think the rule of thumb is unless proven it doesn't stack, it probably stacks. Seems to be that way for all addons that don't say stacking on it.
---
That's Euro not USD.
---
And no, I just tried to enjoy it but simply couldn't. Even if I actually go into it thinking "no DCs, no BS, just mindless fun" I still get those fucking infinite loading screens and 3man games (those aren't a thing anymore since last week) and I just get annoyed again. 120 hours have been played in bursts and I honestly didn't enjoy 90% of my time. I once played No Mither squad with 3 other people and it was tons of fun but besides that the game's just a mess.
---
Sorry, that’s just my art style
---
try not tunneling and you wont experience the BT / DS issue lol
---
On the real though, I feel like the game should look at what happens during a chase, and give you a major bonus for every generator that was completed while you were in said chase in the Lightbringer emblem. Right now getting out of green ranks is a nightmare because low rank killers don't know how to give up a losing chase.
---
Could you elaborate on whats frustrating about them ? I wanna have this discussion , maybe there something were missing, but you have to agree they are WAY better than before.
---
This is why a ton of killers will instantly DC the map.
---
I think they’re all 500? If I’m remembering correctly at least
---
How will they deal with the massive hook suicides once they start banning dcers? That's what I'm wondering.
---
BHVR be like "We nerfed Pig because she'd be too oppressive in the Endgame otherwise. Bloodwarden? Sorry I don't speak Spanish."
---
Lol it happens quite a bit, even for someone who 99% of the time runs BBQ and leaves hook to apply pressure and try my best to go after the unhooked rather than the person who was just unhooked (also to avoid BT and DS which is what they're there for). But I mostly play killer so I guess the numbers are in my favor to come across it more often. But yeah, I've gotten plenty of "go fucking kill yourself" after a gg.
---
The reason it is like this is because dbd rank does not indicate skill. You won't realistically derank unless we have a reset day. They need to rework the whole system, including rewards for ranks. Monthly soft resets are fine, hearthstone uses (or did use idk anymore) those and its a fair system if the ranks aren't absurdly hard to achieve (like dbd and hearthstone)
---
I often do proxy camp in the endgame, that's true, but most of those cases I'm speaking about are just me hearing/seeing a survivor rushing to the hook and following them. That's probably how you get yourself to the unhooked survivor, if you don't proxy camp. But no, I don't facecamp.
---
Honestly, I don't even think proxy-camping the hooked survivor in the EG is toxic, moreover when I'm specifically going for the unhooker rather than for the unhooked.
---
But no, I never said BT is useless. What I said is that you will very rarely see it if you go for the unhookers. But a lot of killers go for the unhooked, that's why people use BT.
---
The whole time this is happening the killer has no idea what’s going on, if he did he’ll might side with you but the ash and nea probably wanted the killer on their side because they see them self’s as the victim here. The whole situation is funny, but poor meg, got caught in the middle of the whole thing
---
u/title2imagebot
---
What's wrong with legion now?
---
2 minutes is more than enough time. Most of the time the collapse lasts over 3 minutes anyway
---
I admittedly use self care a lot, like on at least half of my survivors (I treat each survivor as a different loadout). #NoShameAtAll
---
But really, there should be multiple mori animations per killer. I’ve seen this brought up before, and some people have had really awesome ideas. Each animation should have a random chance to play. It could also be another way for BHVR to earn profit if they sell it in the store, people would totally pay for it.
---
Well, until they fix collision, being pinned in a corner by the killer or another survivor is the only legitimate reason to DC.
---
It's definitely not faster. It's only worth doing if theres multiple people on a gen.
---
If I intentionally change my playstyle to avoid a perk I will rarely see it. What kind of logic is that? Its basically saying if I never heal I will completely ignore nurse's calling.
---
 because it is a 2 killers match, that's why
---
I've only had the hatch closed on me once, but I did the following which worked.
---
Was close to one door, so I opened it to the first red light, then immediately ran to the other door sneaking by the killer.
---
Managed to get the 2nd door open without even a spine chill lightup. Pretty sure they were searching around that first door looking for where I was hiding which gave me plenty of time.
---
&gt; You're telling me a Killer isn't allowed to get a 4k just because 3 of the Survivors are bad
---
&gt; are you telling me a Survivor is entitled to win if their team is bad?
---
The current system is an auto-loss for a survivor unless you happen to find hatch before the killer does. You have to sprint everywhere since taking your time = auto loss. If the killer finds you during your frantic search, you automatically lose since they can close hatch while you are jumping in. Exit gate timers are too long for that to be an option. The light indicators give you no chance of being sneaky about opening an exit gate.
---
* Killers should not be able to close hatch while the survivor is jumping in. The animation even bugs out..
---
* Exit gate light indicators could use some readjustment OR a distance readjustment since right now, all it takes is for the killer to close the hatch and stand between two exit gates.
---
&gt; before EGC, you literally couldn't escape if less than 2 gens were done
---
This I completely agreed with. Getting 2 gens done is extremely easy and if the killer played well enough to prevent that from happening, they absolutely deserve a 4k.
---
Ok.
---
I just wanted to give my Opinion but apparently you aren't allowed to with getting downvoted into hell so Thanks Community! Game is balanced but the community sure as hell ain't.
---
That was some serious potato aim, get wrecked.
---
Which one?
---
Yea I actually don’t mind the new DS TBH.
---
*being funky is not an escape*
---
Ever since some or most of them just came out before?
---
Set messages to friends only and remember a big key thing; Do not respond. They will either find a way to harass you if you do, or use an alt account. Friends only messages and never accept a friend request, always be the one to send. I had to do this for For Honour as well.
---
You don't have to waste your precious time on this bullshit if you just DC.
---
No, really. In the time it takes to die you can be halfway into a new game.
---
Besides league of legends, DBD is right up there. Easy. When I played on xbox, I got more messages in the 2 months I played than the prior 4 years I had my Xbox one, times 4 atleast. It is a very very toxic game. 
---
PC is better since it's mostly post game chat and rarely do they message my steam account. But on console, holy phuck. Most toxic game on console by a LONG SHOT.
---
*I have seen this place before*
---
The only reason he hacked in his legacy was because he fell victim to the save wipe bug that used to plague this game. The devs didn't do anything about it, so he hacked it back in and got banned for it. I wish people would stop judging a book by its cover.
---
They agree more. Yes they were stupid and bad, however him trolling the entire team just made him look worst. They bothered saving him while they shouldve just let him die on the first hook.
---
Honestly Self Care isn't horrible in low rank solo queue when killers tunnel/camp and generally don't put out map pressure. That being said, it's still horrible for time economy and you are better off doing gens if you are not actively being chased.
---
I think licensed are the same price as all other DLC characters, Ash was 500 I think too
---
You dont need monitornwith dead rabbit tbh its overrated together. Just one or the other
---
But I said it already above. The logic is, that going for the unhooker is more beneficial in most cases than going for the unhooked. BT is just one of the reasons.
---
Dashes can be used rather effectively in chase play, and sometimes you are simply out in the open and can go for a dash hit rather than an M1. Gen grabs are indeed not reliable, but what I'm saying is just that Pig is not as affected by MOM as other M1 killers.
---
It was 3 minutes in the first iteration on PTB.
---
It was lowered to 2 after extensive testing because 3 minutes had zero pressure on survivors to get out.
---
Screams in Huntress with Iridescent heads
---
I guess that's a point, thanks for letting me know about that. I'll be waiting
---
This is the best strategy possible imo.
---
I never complain about new DS in my post 😀.
---
And the guy above me complain about BBQ, it's not like you can counter it by hiding in a locker.
---
How about no
---
Haha, as killer I got a “Camper. Still GG.” Make up your mind!
---
Definitely better to work through it most of the time. But if you've been drinking any and get them slow reaction times, best to tap.
---
Yeah if the magic conditions align its pretty much the same thing if you consider bt.
---
I agree.  It has gotten to the point where half the time I bait it out by not lunging until I think the survivor would have used it (especially if I'm chasing a David King).  At this point most of the time either:
---
A. I just do a quick hit when the survivor tries to juke me because I tried baiting it, getting the down.
---
B. The survivor uses it and I lunge pretty much immediately after, getting the down.
---
The only benefit it grants survivors against me at this point is when I absolutely have to lunge to close a chase out before they reach a pallet, or when I take leave of my senses and lunge too early.
---
Sure, because your way of playing is toxic for others, because you effectively prevent someone else from playing the game at all by camping/tunneling early.
---
Moris and Keys should not be in the game.
---
Glad to have someone else enjoying Freddy. Most people just aren't used to having a killer that plays differently and needs another mindset to play, they just want to chase down and hook
---
Uh the packs for bot killer survivor are like 8 - 12
---
Unless I’m mistaken, I’ve heard this is just the first of two waves of changes. I saw through a YouTube video (some guy who breaks down how to play each killer, can’t remember his name) that they were going to nerf him first, then build him back up from there in a different way.
---
They are imaginary internet points bud. I wouldnt worry about it
---
Blood warden can be countered by leaving.
---
USD?
---
When you have mental problems it's like how many fingers you have; Losing one point, losing one finger.
---
Then how about you play a different game.
---
You already had the chance to escape through the hatch and now you have even one more chance to open the door and you want more? Wtf
---
Ruin: when a Killer runs this perk you have a 100% chance of being the only person working on a generator for 5/7/10 minutes while all other Survivors run in circles.
---
Honestly the perk is balanced around solo queue play where your team is not making the most of their time economy while you are being chased. Since they only have the injured status indicator to go by whether you're in an active chase, buying them an extra 20-30 seconds of that is pretty critical.
---
However, in a SWF with voice comms who are actively transmitting the status of the current chase along with the second they go down, it's absolutely broken. The real problem isn't the perk itself but, once again, SWF + comms limiting the design space of what can be put in the game while still being balanced.
---
Yes that is a legit point, but the hatch is supposed to be that last effort, not the doors. Even i as a survivor can accept that if I get completely annihiolated, and the killer gets to the hatch before me, I lost fair and square.
---
The Joker dude.
---
Oh, yeah, absolutely. She's still Nurse after all.
---
U have a higher chance!! Plus its 1v1 so once u find me I'm pretty much screwed if I cant lose u or find hatch!!  So because it's possible in a few games a survivor did nothing all killers get a free kill?!?! Ur favoring the killer side way w much bro
---
I would agree with that general statement. However, MoM will definitely still tick against the pig. You really just can’t avoid it.
---
I’m a new player, and only congratulate the survivors for being good. It feels nice to tell someone that they are good at the game
---
This would be a pretty good Hotline Miami level
---
Buying DLC from the store is cheaper if a) it's a full chapter with both killer and survivor and b) you want to get them both. Also, usually there's an additional cosmetics (not very good, but still) for survivor included in DLC
---
Dude, bringing up NOED "doesn't contribute to the main point."
---
Don't worry tho, you're speaking like a TRUE survivor main, THapps.
---
Those magic conditions you're talking about are usually just my eyes and ears. Or my proxy camping in the endgame, but oh well, no magic in it.
---
I didn’t mention camping my friend that’s on you, but tunnelling, unhook in front of my face or before I even get a chance to leave the area I’m going for the injured guy.
---
Nope, there was just one killer, the Spirit :/ luckily she let us farm...
---
Green rank killer here: Can confirm nothing he said applies to any games with rank 12 or better survivors either.
---
Claudette : WELCOME TO ROTTEN FIELDS MOTHERFUCKERS!
---
I would gg way more often after getting killed, but if I get killed first or second I cant be bothered to wait til the match is over :(
---
I feel like the people who make these are the true heroes of this game. No bickering or rude comments, they make something that both types of mains can enjoy.
---
The upside is greater but the downside of missing a skill check (no one ever is 100% accurate) can be pretty dissuasive if you're not absolutely confident in your great skill check timing.
---
I still prefer to do the gen normally because tapping feels cancerous.
---
Ah yes, Instasaw is a mean build. I assume you're referring to the add-ons which names I can't remember?  
---
Luckily, though, most Billy mains gravitate towards the faster sprint speed and increased sprint control, at least in my experience against him.
---
Survivors already had the hatch option, now you have a chance through the hatch and if thats closed you still have one more chance... no reason at all to buff that further. It is possible to escape through the door, its just not a free escape. Door spawn should improve not because of the EGC but because its dogshit. Make it more consistent, either make so that doors are always somewhat close (which I think its bad) or make them always somewhat far. Making it RNG just pisses one side when they don't get it their way.
---
I watch my husband do this all the time after he dies in a match. He’s so cute. 
---
I usually don’t bother unless it’s to give a heart to a killer that let me live or someone that traded with me to get me off the hook or away from a chase.
---
Don't you mean Leatherface gets punished more then?
---
Right, you are effectively preventing one person from playing the game. That is toxic. I will call it out as such.
---
It's even more stupid because when that happens, you are being told you are going to have an easy win, which means your choice is now to win by being toxic or to win by not being toxic.
---
Or if you do get caught, no one knows how to save you &amp; lets you get to struggle phase on first hook, then unhooks in front of the killer without BT.
---
Id advise seeking professional help if downvotes are impacting you this much
---
I am racist, that's why /s
---
I don't like the people who play her. They tend to be sandbaggers a lot.
---
I have that on my list.
---
Well, it appears to be a mother moose watching over her children while they relax in an inflatable pool. Meanwhile, across the street a minivan has burst into flames. So . . . Canada?
---
The toxicity of Nea is a meme at that point and I laugh at it.
---
I feel like desperate situations in EGC for a sole survivor are... not inherently a problem? Feels like it's working as intended tbh famallama.
---
Yup, those addons that increase revving speed. They are my favourite as I'm kinda potato as Billy
---
So it’s not the team mates fault for unhooking early ? It’s the killers fault as always ? Gotcha.
---
Same
---
Oh yeah, this is only a bit of fun. I like to play off the absurdity of what is essentially character discrimination.
---
I would personally get rid of it, it's a dumb idea, but I know they won't.
---
I would pause time if survivor(s) are unable to leave, this basically makes Blood Warden manageable and allows for the old Pig traps to return. If the hatch is closed by the killer I wouldn't trigger the EGC, they already got the advantage of blocking the survivor from 1/3 exits and can near guarantee victory by just finding the survivor, but the survivor will still have a chance to play slow and get to a gate quietly to open it.
---
Also exponentially slow the EGC timer down the more people are downed/hooked.
---
I am a bit biased since overall I think it's a horrible addition and ruins any tension between survivors and killers at the end of the game as either everyone just leaves without trying to save and/or the ones that don't just die without much hope of doing anything really. I've noticed my killer games have been a lot less exciting for end game especially which sucks.
---
Enduring i suppose. Brutal works well with something else normally. 
---
Bamboozle is a waste of a perk slot imo
---
You can't control what the teammate does. If you were posting about unhooking people right next to the killer I would be calling you out for that. You are posting about being needlessly toxic to people who are already getting screwed over by their teammates, so that is what I am going to call out here.
---
Someone else being shitty doesn't somehow compel you to be shitty too.
---
It's usually 1000 Auric cells for both in the in-game store, but usually cheaper if you buy them outside the game (because they are bundled together). The Auric cell option mostly exists to allow people to buy part of the DLC if they don't want both characters.
---
My problem with BT isn't its normal anti-tunneling use. I think it's a good perk in the arsenal of survivors and it's not overpowered in normal gameplay circumstances. But, after all the generators are powered and the Survivors' only objective is to rush out of the gates it becomes stupid strong and unfun. Even without going for the unhooked person, if Borrowed Time activates, both Unhooked person and Unhooker have, effectively, three health states you have to get through: **Healthy / Enduring** to **Injured**, The other person can **bodyblock** one hit, and then from **Injured** to **Dying**. By the time you do that with any M1 Killer, they are already on the other side of the map. You don't have the time to wait out BT, and the Unhooker can still be bodyblocked by the Enduring Person. And, again, I'm fine with this as a normal gameplay circumstance: it does give a good distance to both survivors from the killer and the killer can now choose which one to go for (usually the unhooker), but not during the End Game Phase. The sheer amount of distance survivors can cover is staggering and in certain maps it's actually impossible to defend against a BT hook rush, because by the time you can down any of the two survivors who can effectively protect each other from one hit by bodyblocking , they are already out of the Exit Gates.
---
Do you realize Freddy is the worst killer even if you mastered him. He is decent  with add ons but it’s doesn’t mean that he a good. The dream transition mind gaming only works on noobs hence he’s a noob stomper. A half decent survivor can easy avoid the “mindgame” of the dream transition.
---
I like using Whispers on Mirror Myers though. It allows me to only wallhack when I need to, meaning I can patrol way the fuck faster.
---
well, that's weird because there are 5 gens instead of 4
---
This is how I feel when I decide to try nurse.
---
Wtf did I just read!?
---
You can still spam hold the saw
---
I like permanently broken effect after mom. Tho in most cases mom is used in endgame, so it won't really matter.
---
I just got Freddy and while that does appear to be the winning strategy, the problem I'm running into is that it appears to be just ludicrously easy to wake up. Rare is the match where I can put someone to sleep, get a hit, then leave them without them waking up within thirty seconds. I'm sure the answer is to run add-ons that reduce skill checks but I really only have the brown ones and I can barely tell the difference.
---
Right. I was also going to add the Yautja Disc, but it would possibly be too op and make The Huntress irrelevant due to her hatchets being overshadowed by a smaller and harder to see throwing disc.
---
I dont think you know what dream transition mindgames are. If I notice a survivor just running instead of looping I will just not mindgame, and thats the mindgame.
---
It makes me laugh how survivors are both sore winners and sore losers. It's teabag or DC, no in between.
---
Most SWF aren't full groups, or even trying to be super coordinated though. The stats released a couple weeks back show that SWF has a very small impact.
---
It’s just too time consuming of a perk. The perk itself isn’t that bad, and if it’s one survivor that has it it’s no big deal. Even if the survivors are all solo, just having two survivors run MoM and activate, that’s the equivalent of a M1 killer downing a whole survivor from healthy state.
---
I guess M1 killers could start using NOED to counter the time loss, but I don’t find NOED a fun perk to run. And I know survivors hate it. Would love to see an alternative solution that’s a good compromise for both sides.
---
Yeah, I noticed that too... It could be a brand new bug I think, maybe the survivor that didn't load in actually tried to replicate the second killer glitch, but got kicked out from the game instead? No idea.
---
This is based on my opinion, purple perks has some sort of counter in way or the other.
---
Feel free to ask anything
---
This. When they get hit and use their MS bonus to come and save you...and you go down right after.
---
Keep an eye on them, if they wake up  thats your chance to down. Typicaly once you notice them healing thats when you should start heading back, if they dont wake up wait for a bit patrolling the area around them while retaining the aura reading.
---
Oh I’m blind.
---
&gt;If we're being honest, this game should have certain perks which give a lesser effect when you queue in SWF.
---
&gt;MoM is well balanced for solo queue play when you aren't guaranteed teammates who focus on objectives or hook farm. When you have an ENTIRE TEAM running the perk on voice comms who pretty much spend every microsecond not being chased directly humping a generator, it becomes an actual problem.
---
Solo queue player here. Even in that scenario MoM is not balanced. More often than not, killers lose games just because they chose to chase me. 
---
My current build is Sprint Burst, Deliverance, Decisive Strike and MoM. Whenever I am able to get my Deliverance up, the killer is probably going to lose the match.
---
First he needs to hit me twice (2 MoM stacks) in order to hook me for the first time and that alone takes 2 to 5 minutes depending on how good the killer is at dealing with looping and how survivor sided the map is. Meanwhile my teammates are doing generators. When he finally hooks me, I simply kobe before he has the chance to leave the area which prevents my teammates from leaving their generators.
---
The killer either goes back and resume chase with me or he leaves me alone, which means I will be the one going straight to a generator. If he does chase me, I will loop him for about 40s before "making a mistake" and getting caught. I will use DS and resume the chase but now I have MoM ready to go. By the time he finally is done with me, he lost the game. 
---
It happens more often than not, give it a try yourself.
---
thanks for also sharing at r/PerkByDaylight ^^
---
Okay I see, I honestly just want the killer mostly because y'know, Ghostface.
---
They definetly make them a bit better for attracting people,  go on steam Halloween dlc is still the most popular dlc for dbd as of course
---
Me. Love. Myers
---
But people also thought that at that time ds was the shit so they had to buy it.
---
If you run no mither you can counter bloodhound
---
There should be a separate, smaller board for the basement and or if you’re playing on a map with multiple stories
---
I just had a flashback to when I attempted to play nurse... on console... *cries*
---
Wait 6?
---
Bubba, billy, plauge and huntress right? Only 4
---
How would you suggest to counter Rancor once you're exposed?
---
I love balanced landing tho it has saved my ass on bullshit loops which you can go on for a long time haha
---
Be that as it may the fact that voice comms being able to be used provides a significant advantage, whether or not most groups choose to employ it or not.
---
As someone who plays both survivor and killer it's INSTANTLY noticeable which groups are using comms and which aren't by how quickly they run to gens the moment I'm chasing someone.
---
If you run no mither you can counter sloppy butcher
---
Nice. Always satisfying to get a full stacked Devour
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
What counterplay? I am genuinely curious and don't have a clue.
---
Huntress would get dicked vs balanced landing and haddonfield even with iri head lol
---
Is there a no teabaging rule?
---
It’s takes 7 seconds for the dream transition. The mind games don’t work. It is a to long and he has no chase power. Can only slow the game down with add ons.
---
Would open up the door for afk boots. Jumping lockers or walking in corners to wait.
---
But i like the Basic idea. Maybe combine it with the afk crows. If u get crows u get no more points For survival per min or even a penalty on those Bonus points. That way we avoid bots and afk gameplay
---
Why sould I, I can play dbd perfectly fine
---
You really want to impress me, do this in red ranks! But nice work.
---
&gt; You don't want to remain injured or reveal your aura to them just because of this perk.
---
Do you even know how MoM works? It only reveals your aura if you heal after being protected AND before being downed.
---
If MoM protects you, the killer continues to chase and downs you, you can continue to play normally without any down side.
---
I just see it as taking advantage of the teams mistake...
---
Kindred can counter Insidious
---
No Mither can counter Bloodhound 
---
Unbreakable or  No Mither help counter Deerstalker, Tenacity can too if done right
---
Lightweight counters Predator, but really Predator counters itself
---
Iron Will somewhat counters Stridor, 
---
Sloppy Butcher can be countered by Botany Knowledge, medkits, or We'll Make It
---
Wake Up semi-counters Remember Me but the obsession opening the gate is the true counter
---
Calm Spirit counters Spies from the Shadows
---
Endgame timer, especially with someone on hook, lasts a lot longer than 60 seconds, so when you open it. Leave
---
 If blood warden does somehow come up right away, boom. You wait that 60 seconds and then leave. Is it that hard to understand how to counter?
---
That’s why I never burn those offerings unless it’s double bloodpoints and/or the killer messages me and says he wants to farm. I’ve lost so many offerings to the same shit :(
---
Hiding in a locker will prevent the killer from seeing you once exit gates are powered. Then just wait and run for the door or hatch.
---
This is the only game community I've seen where people want to be rewarded for shitty teammates. In every other multiplayer game I play people just accept that sometimes your random teams won't be optimal and if you want to change that then you play with friends. When I playing R6 Siege with randos, I dont get a health boost when I'm the last one alive against 2+ operators. Or increased bullet damage. I get wrecked or I play insanely smart somehow and clutch it. That's what being the last survivor is. Clutch games should be an exception. This obsession with "fairness" in an asymmetrical game is pretty sad.
---
Before you paint me as some salty killer main, I don't even play killer anymore and I won't be until Ghostface releases. Survivor is easier and stresses me out less.
---
Nothing. I guess people just missed the joke. I make fun of them because they both breathe heavy and have unhealthy looking stuns.
---
Problem is I don’t wanna wait for 5 minutes to gg. I wanna get killed again. If I die last I’ll toss one, but let’s be real, I’m the best and I don’t die.
---
Pig=upvote.
---
This game is good rn except there are something’s that should change. Instead of wasting time on cosmetics they should fix bugs and glitches. They need to push a harder punish on people who dc. The rank system should be reworked. We should get some reward for actually trying to rank up. They should also fix the graphics on this game. This is just my opinion but from what I’ve seen from the leaks we might get a battle pass :(.
---
Damn monsterous shrine with no counter play
---
Pig=upvote
---
Red rank chase for 10min. Ruin down, all gens, done, door opened, found the hatch in chase told my swf to leave and i jumped out of the hatch. I still dream of it to happen again.
---
The purple perks are ones that can be countered in some way or the other
---
Soo yea you are right for insidious, remember me and spies from the shadow
---
If that’s the logic, then I would argue some of the other perks can also be countered via gameplay.
---
You definately dont know what dream transition mindgameing is.
---
Also, if the doors are powered because the killer closes hatch, there is no reason for NoEd to activate. That’s ridiculous.
---
It's not a "relatively" small chance. I have never seen a survivor make it out of the match once that hatch has been closed. 
---
If their intention was for the closing of the hatch to give survivors the ability to leave through the gates, they failed hard by not accounting for the fact that the killer only has to patrol 2 doors which are often within view of each other and, if the survivor is found, the killer doesn't even have to hit them as long as they can occupy them away from the doors for the remainder of the Collapse. 
---
I, personally, wouldn't blame a survivor for just wanting to DC when the hatch closes in order to avoid what comes after.
---
Your narcoleptic gen is used a lot now and days and hook maniac is how you should just play.
---
Looks really well done. As long as they like it, good for them.
---
Huh, I play FH too and I've gotten only one or two rage messages. But I will remember to do that.
---
This guy is a killer, not survivor. That much is obvious.
---
That would just leave Save the Best for Last, I'm not sure what a good counter for that is unless you have an obsession with a death wish.
---
I disagree with so many
---
No generator? Is this The Game?
---
We don’t have all the details, but thanks to Bricky and his sources he said that it’s gonna be more lore based and Nightmare On Elm Street fans are gonna love it.
---
I cant see shit
---
My last 2 games I was the last survivor. Killer didn't close the hatch and I didn't find it before he found me. He downed me and then closed the hatch so I was lying there waiting to get killed by the entity. Not fun to be honest.
---
If a killer with blood warden is able to wait out that 2 minutes and hook someone, there’s a certain set of circumstances that make it impossible to leave after the hook. It’s why you gotta abandon teammates
---
Adrenaline can give you an advantage in a chase and remove 50% of the killers prgress in that chase. 
---
I clearly said in my post for Borrowed to be at endgame only.
---
If you run No Mither you can counter escaping
---
Deliverance requires you to unhook someone and get the Safe Hook Rescue score event to activate it. If you get found first or if another teammate unhooks before you, or if the killer downs the person you unhooked before you get the activation, then you get no value.
---
You are hinging your game plan on a lot lot of variables that just don't happen in public matches at a constant frequency.
---
I know, but how do you counter the strongest 2/3 of the perk?
---
It counters chainsaws and iridescent heads how tf it aint nerfed yet i dunno
---
;)
---
I play killer and survivor equally yet have never brought NOED, good of you to assume that though, 
---
and the point is why would you say a perk is op when it only ignores one hit when a perk on the killer side also ignores one hit.
---
If you are that desperate for a post exit gates kill. Camp the guy and when teamate runs up hit the teamate unhooking twice. There no borrrowed.
---
Only thing here without counter is a guy with ds unhooking a guy with borrowed but in that scenario fair enough
---
Ace is the best survivor change my mind.
---
the one time this works in my favor is wraith with the 12m wall hacks addon, then the shoe is on the other foot since they can't see me, always feels good
---
Nah, its Self Care
---
&gt; STBFL
---
Just dont get hit idiot
---
My favorite survivor is Feng Min, she’s like a confident badass in my book. 
---
I also like David because, uh, um... he has a good personality.
---
Imagine still thinking decisive is meta
---
You speak the truth. The sore winners are the worst of the worst.
---
WITH HER FINGER AND HER THUMB
---
Kind of yes but he doesn't have a burned face, his faced turned really white for some reason and he didn't lose his hair but his hair turned really black.
---
He would be the kid of Freddy and the Joker
---
Little bit late but he also literally didn’t have any BBQ stacks until hooking Claud. I’d say between the low chase points and the only stack after hooking, he pretended to be afk the whole game.
---
Big boy gang
---
&gt;I literally see Borrowed Time every single game. It's stupid strong now, given the fact that it's basically a free extra hit and encourages aggressive dive bombs on the hook, giving an almost guaranteed escape if the killer doesn't have a way to one hit down a Survivor, especially in the End Game Collapse where if you didn't apply enough pressure and burned away all of the second chance perks for Survivors they WILL escape;
---
Stop camping hooks and BT stops becoming a problem.
---
I have been very exact in every single one of my replies. Nowhere will you see the words "taking advantage of their mistake" as something that is bad.
---
The toxic behavior has always been "effectively preventing someone from playing the game." This is done by killers by camping/tunneling early. Similarly it's done by survivors when they play swf and get on comms and never let the killer find any of them.
---
The biggest difference is that most Legions don’t tunnel now, which is nice. I suppose the match result (and whether I want to die a slow death) will be based heavily on the map and the rest of the survivors. When the game is one long mend-a-thon, no one is doing gens, and Legion is doing laps around the map, I just want the game to end so I can move on to something else. 
---
I’d honestly take a Huntress with Iridescent over a Legion.
---
Has Kindred. Still gets left on hook til second state.
---
I'm pretty sure the de-pipping wasn't really seen as a disadvantage from the Survivor's side. People would disconnect and would often follow it up with "If I de-pip then I just get an easier match next time."  
---
Honestly, I think the de-pipping was hurting the game more than the actual disconnects since it made it super easy for highly skilled players to go back to the low ranks and wreck shit. Which they did a lot.  
---
I can't imagine someone with 700 hours experience would need this explained to them.
---
Tbf I've been having shit killer games because of rank reset, I don't play much killer so I just dropped from 14 to 16, unlike most of the survivors I'm facing. This was just a breath of fresh air amidst all the tbags. (And the totem spawn was a big part of it obviously)
---
He still has the quality of life of being able to vault pallets. It's not as fast now ( it's at survivor vault speed ) but he still ignores loops just the way he did, with the addition of being as fast as a m1 killer.
---
Legion right now is as balanced as he can be, he's fast while unfrenzied, has a fair cooldown and he is a little bit _faster_ in frenzy, but not too fast to the point of unfairness. He will probably be slightly buffed, but the nerfs are finally over, because there isn't anything significant to be nerfed anymore, his main exploit is out of the scene, he doesn't need to hit people multiple times now that he is fast enough to chase comfortably without a speed penalty. And his power still works as intended, with the exception of not having 0 cooldown. 
---
So, in theory. Legion isn't the worst killer as people tought he would turn into post patch, he's decent/good at best. Legion _cant_ be as bad as Freddy because he has a power that helps him in chases, even after the rework. unlike freddy that only has a power that cripples him more than it helps him.
---
&gt;NOED isn't earned and more often then not it rewards them with a kill at the crucial end game collapse plus they mostly camp the hook with said NOED to secure the kill.
---
Fucking thank you. Noed is something so powerful that it should be earned. That's why it's fucking bullshit. You can sit in the corner all game as the killer and do nothing and NOED can win you the game. I've fucking done it just to prove how bullshit NOED is (as Plague too, so that makes it even worse). Devour hope is a beautiful example of how shit like that should be designed
---
*unzips David’s pants and starts sucking*
---
There are five totems on each map. If no Hexes are in play, then all five will be dull. If one dull totem is still around when the exits are powered, then NOED takes effect.
---
If you read any of my other comments about the argument, you would know that my problem with BT isn't its utility as an anti-tunneling / camping instrument, but as a sheer get-out-of-jail-free card survivors can pull out every single time the gates are open as they are now both 2 hits to down and can bodyblock each other; giving them so much distance no M1 killer can even defend against a decent BT rush.
---
Shift out Stridor for predator
---
A new bug with the last update, it’s unpopular we don’t care about him trapper though so it’ll be awhile before it’s fixed.
---
Some little advise: look behind you so you dont drop pallets THAT early, and when waking up just spam the skillcheck button, is faster than what you did
---
Spine Chill is my go to perk when I've been smoking or drinking and the game actually feels slightly intense again. Basically, I see it as 'my observation skills are way down and I don't want get jumpscared to death' lmao.
---
Iron will is a counter to Stridor when it comes to being injured.
---
Exit gates should have always been on opposite ends of the map. If you as a killer are gonna trigger the collapse you should not get a promised win just bc the gates spawned relatively close to each other. The whole reason 2 gates exist is so the killer can't camp one and prevent Surviviors from escaping
---
U ok?
---
I say leave it how it is. You got time to find the hatch before the killer especially if they’re going after the other survivor and you’re the last one standing. At that point fuck the gens look for the hatch. If they close it before you then yeah you got fucked and now you’re playing hard mode. You shouldn’t get rewarded because you and your team played badly and got cut down till EGC triggers.
---
what's the deal with the cat?
---
She said bad stuff to me like "you are a big poo poo head" :(
---
The point is until ECG was here, close door spawns weren't nearly as bad since you weren't on a timer. Now if the killer closes a hatch and the doors are close together, the killer wins unless the survivor(s) have a key by some chance. They got rng'd out of a good chance at surviving now. 
---
I like the thought behind EGC, but I used to 4k a good 80% of my matches at rank one, consistently playing about 2/3 killer roster to about a 50% chance cause the hatch spawns on the survivor most matches I've played. I consider myself a good and fair killer. I dont tunnel, I dont camp, I dont bm, I usually let the survivors get easy/free saves all day long. (I think I may have had BT proc against me 5 times in the near 3 years I've been playing. I hook them and run far away 99.9% of the time.) And if I felt someone deserved it for one reason or another, I'd give them the hatch. Now it's usually the person hiding in  the corner all game who gets a free win.
---
They need to make the hatch spawned open for the survivor if they meet a certain criteria first. Such as a % of time they spent doing something (working gens, healing, being chased, etc...) compared to overall game length. If they meet it, hatch spawns opened. If not, it spawns closed. Once EGC starts, a key is then spawned in the basement chest. (Chest will reclose and the key will be put in it if it had already been opened) which they can use to open the hatch again, or go for the exit gate. This would allow gate spawns to stay as is, and give the survivor another option at surviving without it being "free" for those who don't really deserve it.
---
Mom is a pretty cheesey perk even when you aren't playing an m1 killer *cries in Nurse*
---
I won't.
---
Sitting at the escape and not leaving.
---
That’s not the killers fault
---
Well, I don't think he's bad, but the whole reason most people played him was for the speed. He's much slower in frenzy now, he even vaults slower. It'd be nice to get the speed back, even if the duration is shortened.
---
It's not that Surviviors fault either
---
Loud ass Lampkin too,  unlucky.
---
Just open it after a hook happens
---
Didn't say that it was the Killer opening the gates because I thought that was blatantly obvious, but I guess you have to spell everything out for todlers.
---
Oh is power enable him to leave a trail of fire behind him. This makes him good a stopping some of jukes that plague the game
---
I run Deliverance as well, and it's pretty easy not to be found first if you try. I'd say I get my Deliverance in 85 - 90% of the games I play.
---
Key
---
Well.....they are meant to be a team
---
&gt;your team lost
---
How is that my fault in this scenario?
---
Oh now i get it. Thanks for the advise.
---
Honestly i was cringing when that happened
---
I mean, at the end of the day most killers besides billy and the nurse have to resort to a basic m1 chase. Legion just mixes it up a little, him, doc, and huntress are really kind of the only mix ups to that
---
Imagine thinking that's a good point.
---
If that was true why is there no VC in soloq. 
---
It's not a team game in soloq. It's a "4 Surviviors try to loosely work together to outsmart one killer". 
---
That's why SWF is so strong. If they were meant to be a team, this game would be balanced around SWF and soloq would not exist without voice chat.
---
SC and UE too high.
---
I have never in my life seen a Myers “lose” and not facecamp and be super salty
---
Ur ok ? I never said that these things were OP. You read in things I don't even said, Imao.
---
I mean I could say dark sense because it let's you see the killer with no counter (not counting Freddy/tier1 Myers) but it sucks because it's only if you do the gen unless it's the last gen
---
Hey the less NOED this game sees the better
---
For some reason I thought of spine chill... 
---
"For some reason"...
---
ah, i get that now. thanks mate!
---
Then why the fuck give any Survivior a chance when the hatch is closed. Why not have the entity just pop out as soon as it's closed
---
Please explain what you think it is
---
&gt;Predator counters itself
---
Only time I escaped during the collapse was bc a Spirit gave me the gate. She was gunning for her adept, must have realized I was doing the same, didn't kill me when she downed me, let me open the gate and escape.
---
I ALWAYS say gg if the killer/survivors were fair. Although sometimes I get really tilted as killer and just leave the lobby immediately, haha.
---
But as survivor I always gg unless the killer camps or tunnels.
---
Dwight best boy.
---
Maybe turn up brightness so we can see it
---
If you decide to play more Hag, don’t put traps next to gens or in pallets. Survivors will crawl near gens so it’s better to put them a little ways off and phantasms in pallets just mean a stun (unless you are playing body blocker Hag). I usually trap a little after windows and a few in random places where survivors would be less cautious about running. Make Your Choice is your best friend and if you use Mint Rag, so is surveillance. 
---
As for Spirit, don’t always go invisible immediately at a loop, just Stan perfectly still until they decide to vault a pallet cause they think your phasing or begin to run away (then phase). Also make sure to never look in the direction your going to phase since the husk takes the direction right as charge is full (so if you are going to gens north, look west when charging).
---
I would like it to be at least somewhat far. I'm just saying that my reason is not because EGC is unbalanced (which I don't think it is) but because its basically a coin flip to which side has a huge advantage. I think doors being near is just frustrating to survivors and boring to killers, they could balance around them being more far apart

We all know the whole point of them waiting is they want the satisfaction of you seeing them teabag for even one second. I don't give them that. I'll afk and do some work around the house. Now I don't have to.
---
Male survivors clearly superior because since they get found and chased more, they learn how to loop and outrun the killer more. I'll leave a lobby if theres 3 Claudettes, because I'll end up being the only one being chased all game.
---
what? when i was healing myself?
---
And you can counter survaillence by just letting the gens regress all the way 4head.
---
If I got upset about getting downvoted here I would have left ages ago... thanks though.
---
The door timer is 20s you can easily open one when the killer downs and hooks someone
---
It's another story if he slugs
---
But then they can just walk.
---
You lost dude, you picked the wrong door and didn't got to the hatch on time, just admit defeat and move on to the next game
---
If we had "better" spawns for doors, and by that you just mean "Far enough so I can hide and open it every game" where would the point of being able to close the hatch even be if the durvivor is going to get away anyway?
---
You aint escaping just because you hid better than everyone else
---
I mean, do you *really* need to counter monstrous shrine?
---
DbD doesn’t support mouse and keyboard, it’s kinda sad because it doesn’t add any advantage to this game like it would for other games but, yea it doesn’t support it sadly
---
The only reason it’s bad in low rank is bc good survivors can just loop and have dead hard, i would say if you are new or just bad in high ranks you can use it.., but, please please please don’t selfcare with thanaphobia and or sloppy butcher etc. (thanks for the response)
---
Just started playing Trapper this week after 500 hrs. So much fun. Kike you said, he's disgusting on Haddonfield. Very underrated killer in my opinion. Don't understand the people who put Pig and Clown above him. His snowball potential is insane.
---
I've seen a lot of them running it since he was released tbh,  it's a really strong perk especially with sloppy butcher because selfcare meta. It's an obvious pick imo
---
I think NOED counters Adrenaline and Insidious counters Borrowed Time. I know nobody except Bubba mains use Insidious, but theoretically, it counters BT, right ? And Wraith and Pig can also counter BT with their powers. Probably even Ghost Face will can.
---
Yep
---
And killers like Billy, Huntress or Plague can counter Mettle of Man.
---
You can use it on the tree and the basement stairs.
---
The tree is tricky but once you learn how to get on it you'll bamboozle a lot of killers when you bl off of it since you don't get the falling animation for some reason.
---
I agree it's trash for bl tho.
---
I got a 3 man Devour Hope and a ragequit because of Haunted grounds
---
Obviously the counter to fire up is to do no gens
---
My only beef with NOED is I'm a solo player and I cleanse all the dull totems I can but most the time I don't see one and my teammates just say fuck it and don't cleanse them and then the NOED activates anyway.
---
I really need to know how this game would work.
---
It's called equip wake up it Def helps. Not sure how many seconds it shaves off though
---
Im not sure why people are down voting this. Its true
---
Stop making me hyped for Ghosrface.
---
FUKIN' YES DUDE
---
Yes, I love both of these small but amazing possible changes as it wouldn’t be too difficult to do. It would make loading the game up more climatic atleast. Totem counter would be nice so you don’t have to waste time if you know the killer has no ed of such. (thanks for the response)
---
WOOIAH!
---
What'd this guy say
---
I am envious of your skill at drawing hands
---
if you're dc once every 20 games then that's understandable but i still think people that dc should get a 30 min cool down because most of the time people dc just because they got hooked first or because they got slugged
---
I think it’s a little too busy. Just the hex totem would be cool.
---
Why nurse's?
---
Oh, he was slugging. Kate was hooked, I was slugged, Jane got slugged, Laurie camped hatch on the total opposite side of the map.
---
Nobody 
---
Chad Killers: Fire up
---
I feel this. Brings a tear to the eye every time.
---
Are you kidding? No one complains about moris and keys? You are ok with the game being cut short and incredibly unfair?
---
“Should be removed” is a change as there is no way to fix these broken features.
---
I mean then you should punish killers for dodging aswell.
---
I understand the punishment for excessive dcing
---
Stridor? Thanataphobia?
---
It is unlikely that they will buff his speed during frenzy in place of lowering the duration, since it would negate the whole purpose of his heart-beat gimmick which they were clearly trying to enhance with these latest changes.
---
True but it honestly just depends. If i've run in to ruin 3-4 games in a row then i'mma just tap for that one.
---
The parts that *are* visible make me think of Ganon lol
---
LOL
---
Bud it gives the killer a fucking insta down and speed boost for failing, you are on the koolaid. NOED just sucks, and many stronger perks are more tolerable because they are actually fair. 
---
If you seriously think DbD will become “Call of Duty” because of a fucking totem counter, you are in the Koolaid. NOED sucks, you know it sucks, but you insist on defending it anyway.
---
I already responded about the survivor perks.
---
I hardly ever say gg in general, far too lazy.
---
Doctor has chess pieces for add-ons. He can probably win at that at least.
---
Depipping for a dc isn't the answer. Automated timeouts for a dc is the answer. If you dc, you get a 5 minute timeout. If you dc again within a certain time you get a 15 minute timeout, etc.
---
Probably thana
---
Can someone explain to me how B and C tier are different? Besides piggy.
---
Eh, it happens all the time. I don't really care about upvotes or downvotes, it makes no difference to me. Thank you though for the defense.
---
Huntress?
---
You know mori’s are coming, keys need 3 people dead or 5 gens done, that’s not cutting it short. Mori’s do not give killers many points and are not every game, they just a add on for daily’s and to keep the game different. Just don’t get hook 4Head
---
That's just improvement!
---
Changing your style is good it means you're learning and exploring your artistic abilities.
---
there is no need to feel upset/shameful about changing things. :)
---
Yeah, maybe they could've kept the speed if they nerfed deep wounds.
---
But honestly that frenzy speed was a necessary sacrifice for the sake of legion, 115% movement speed turns Legion into a very good killer, but if BHVR did that change while keeping Legion's fast frenzy speed. He would be pretty broken, and it's better off like that rather than old "stab and run away" or "stab and moonwalk" legion
---
Gotta 99% those gates !
---
There actually is a Board for the bm. :D its a Grey tile with stairs and space for 4 hook tokens
---
I’d replace nurses with legion
---
it is real my dude no worries,but the corn are planted in rows,so if you are running in that direction,try to go in a straight line.
---
Bubbas a good boy he's just kinda stupid
---
It actually can be faster. Because when you even get a normal skill check it regresses it and there is a short delay before it starts to progress. With gen tapping it is a slow but steady progression. So if you're getting multiple skill checks in a row, that is significantly slower. It's happened to me plenty of times. That's why sometimes i'll just gentap it.

DBD Boardgame Board Version 2.0

Design by me with Dungeon Painter Studio.
---
Can you tell in which Macmillan and Farm Map it's based ;)? 
---
What do you Think?
---
More Pics:
---
Entity respects the farm
---
B tier are killers who proc mettle of man have their abilities to  allow them to deal with it effectively 
---
C tier killers proc mettle of man and their ability doesn’t  help when it’s procs
---
Her hatchets don’t build stacks
---
You want larger terror radius on killers like Legion (killers instinct) and Doctor (static field) that get something from it, using perks related to it is also good. A reduced terror radius is very effective to sneak up on people
---
Is that an anti-sea-bear circle?
---
There's always the one asshole who can't just simply say, "Looks good mate."
---
Unless it's at the endgame. Can't protect the hook without getting flamed in the dm's. Can't pick up the unhooked guy without getting ds'd. Lose lose situation.
---
The line work is incredibly on this, plus I love all they decided to put in it.
---
[Something like this?](https://youtu.be/Wow0L59qyiQ?t=172)
---
Stay super far from basement counters monsterous shrine
---
That's what I do to help my case, actually corn was bad but it was a little manageable. After the legion update where they brightened colors and changed how corn looks, I pretty much couldn't see anything until now. Doesn't help with the fact that console does not have optimization settings, and frame drops
---
Plus heal yourself so she doesnt just down you otw, this is a balanced change
---
Rough day?
---
Once I had like a month long break from dbd, and so my rank was naturally reset to 18 by the time I got back on. I had a blast massacring rank 20s with my p3 nurse, but still it is not fair for the survivors.
---
How do you know?
---
Honestly, these memes are just silly. Legion is fine now, he actually feels a lot better to play and you can have a lot of fun playing him as a more stall-oriented killer.
---
Honestly, Myers might be one of the best killers to learn patience with. Slow and steady into a snowball effect.
---
Your out of your element, Dwight!
---
Oh ok
---
Lol Sure...
---
p3 Claudette main incoming.
---
Does using pharmacy and ace in the hole mean you get a green medkit with addons, or does pharmacy guarantee a green medkit with no addons?
---
idk but i have a SLIGHT feeling that OP is fishing for compliments
---
I want to give advice to these kind of killers after the game. If only they didn’t leave immediatly :(
---
i'm pretty sure if you have insidious active it doesn't go away unless you move or attack so ringing the bell half way probably wouldn't do anything. and the whooshing sound from spirit is entirely separate from the terror radius, so insidious wont get rid of it, the only thing that can get rid of the whooshing is prayer beads or your terror radius (or husks terror radius more accurately, so having no terror radius without the beads is actually counter productive to masking the whoosh)
---
Hmm, I would move leatherface lower. He’s easy to loop and often has to punch you, same with trapper, assuming you avoid traps, easy mom game
---
I think it's nice to see that basically all the meta perks have counter plays, which is how it should be
---
street wise counters overwhelming presence , soloing a gen counters discordance , dropping a pallet early counters enduring, boil over kinda counters iron will, technician counters surveillance in some way, lantern addons counters lightborn (unlikely but still counters).
---
Yeah but how many expect you to run predator
---
I want a dbd piece but cant bring myself to do it yet for some reason. Probably just the logo if i do. Im already pretty much covered everywhere else so i guess why not right? Someone tell me to do it lmao.
---
I’ve escaped 3 times after hatch is closed, i don’t even bother finding it if i don’t know beforehand where it is, just run straight to the door and wait for the killer to close the hatch, only takes 15 seconds to open only a billy would have time to reach you and check both doors
---
well i really don't think BHVR going to change a thing in the endgame since people is happy about it
---
Make it so blinding a Claudette uses the old blind screen and blinds them for twice as long, I think that’s balances things out. I mean Claud having Wraiths ability is kinda overpowered.
---
I love it so much
---
oof, found the garbage survivor
---
I also play Plague and Adrenaline has never been an issue for me no matter who I play, infact it's especially so for Plague
---
Honestly after playing a couple games with him he isn't that bad. I really do think they went overboard with the whole "killer instinct" gimmick but it's neat. It'd be nice if you could get a speed boost from pulling off chain stabs (a 1.5% increase per survivor, making it easier to land a 4 survivor chain stab). I think maybe buffing his vaulting speed back to where it was would be nice.
---
no when you dropped the pallet very early
---
I've legit ran into mostly nice survivors as killer, and almost as much salty killers as I have salty survivors.
---
i think that the only reason people still hate Legion is because of what they were before and they were a huge fucking mess back in the day. i suppose it leaves a sort of bad aftertaste that's still around.
---
or they just don't like getting injured all the time, idk
---
Survivor: *Outplays Tru3*
---
Tru3: **FOOKIN DED 'ARD**
---
the timer of bloodwarden is 1 minute and egc is 2 minutes, and egc halves its speed when a survivor is downed/hooked... so yes, you can counter it by leaving
---
That would also balance out Claud not being temporarily stunned in the same manner as wraith
---
B and c tier should be merged. The fact Nurse and spirit can just hit you again doesnt mean they counter it in anyway.
---
Pig should be A tier she can dash to deny stacks
---
Meme :)
---
Better than going against it on Temple of Purgation, that map is heaven for Balance Landing.
---
When you're a salty survivor who can't handle nurses(Just don't heal in TR)
---
Legion is even easier to survive against now. Like laughably easy. Playing him feels awful. Though I guess I have the exploiters and crybabies to thank for that
---
Especially when chases can last a couple of minutes too
---
Take a break play other killers maybe then go back to her
---
if you wanna talk about tricky burns, try getting one on a nurse
---
Whispers below rank 3 is shit, but at rank 3 is very good, sloppy butcher doesn’t really have counterplay because the entire point of it is to make them bleed and increase healing times, predators only counterplay  (besides itself) is to just not run, which slows the game down a fair bit, endurings only real counterplay is to not pallet stun, which makes it more effective, play with your food would just be have the obsession just not end the chase, and the killer can just walk off anyways,  save the best for last can somewhat be countered by having the obsession body block a lot, but the killer can just, not kill them. Spies from the shadows is a pretty shit perk as it is. Truth is, almost every perk in the game is terrible on its own, that’s why you get four, you have to use perks so they compliment each other, enduring is good on its own, but combined with spirit fury or brutal strength is amazing, or sloppy butcher combined with nurses calling, (thantophobia is just terrible as it is). But perks can also hurt each other, dying light and any other of Mikey’s perks. It also depends on what killer your playing, M&amp;A is awful on Doctor, any aura perks on hillbilly are amazing.
---
Fair enough, you need balls of steel to try and pull that one off
---
&gt; for failing
---
How, specifically, do they get it "for failing"? As I recall, even for doing well, you still get its effect. It never fails, survivors refer to NOED as some noob-boosting mechanism, yet the shit killers that *actually* depend on it never make it past rank 10. What if a killer ran his ass off the entire game but the survivors were just too optimal? Should he just lie down and let them go? NOED represents a massive tempo swing in the favor of the killer. Sure, it might make you feel bad that your opponent top-decked lethal on you, but that's the luck of the draw.
---
&gt; If you seriously think...you are in the Koolaid
---
Well, I got my answer to whether or not you actually have something to say versus just acting above the issue. 
---
To be honest, I'm not against a rework of NOED to be something more akin to a heightened version of StBFL. Way faster swing cooldown with some kind of hindered status on the survivors struck - something along these lines. One tapping people isn't particularly skillful, so this would shift it some. Of course, there would have to be balancing work to ensure this along with StBFL couldn't be stacked, but it's just a wild spitballed idea. 
---
Whatever the case is, and regardless of how you feel about it, NOED is a powerful gamble that makes the killer feared for the first time in the entire match. Nobody bats an eye with the killer running at them during the regular part of the trial, but plenty of people shit their pants when they run up after the gates are powered. As someone who also plays quite a bit of survivor, moments like that are what keep the game interesting with the horror theme, otherwise it's just a bunch of conga lining a killer who has no hope of victory because of speed boosts and wipe animations.
---
Now, unless you've got something factual and objective to add, we're done here; at least, I am. There's not much to be gained in the way of intelligent discussion with someone squawking about "rewards for shitty killers" and wanting even more information to be given to them because God forbid they have to take responsibility for it themselves.
---
Hey I got one for ya. How about we next give killers a HUD showing how many people have used their DS already, how many times they've been hooked, and how many pallets are left on the map? Fair's fair, right?
---
I love piggy though,thanks for the draw. Please repost it lighter
---
How the fuck are you going to say that when shirtless ~~daddy~~ David exists
---
Curious how you find Legion more fun to play after after the changes.  They just made them much slower and less effective in every way when using their power, with the compensation being that they are better outside of their power.  It just feels awful using their power now
---
This does not spark joy
---
Did... did he put no mither as the best perk in the game?
---
You are not wrong
---
Honestly the first match you have as a survivor against a new killer with mechanics other than M1 is insanely frightening
---
one match there was a freddy with noed and he had all survivors asleep while exit gates were powered, he hooked someone and what do you know I get a message "why didn't you save me pussy?!?!?!"
---
Whenever I'm able to create a state of total panic as The Pig and force survivors to actually make lethal choices. Like if the round reaches a point where one person gets hooked, another is slugged, and the other two have ticking traps on their heads all at the same time.
---
Is it still an opinion if it's a proven fact?
---
What is the most reliable way to counter BBQ&amp;Chili? I am just not a fan of hiding in lockers. I try to get close to the hook if I can, but when I'm too far away I've considered running in one direction for 4 seconds, then backtracking and going the other way. Does that work? And when exactly does the 4 seconds BBQ&amp;Chili timer begin? Right as we hear the scream and see the hooked survivor aura?
---
a shame for his face tho
---
Haha nice timing
---
I don’t think it takes to much luck. I did it the other day. Played like a noob the entire game so the survivors would get really cocky. Slugged a guy at end game until I heard the timer hit under the 1 minute mark. I hooked him. Walked away and watched the door for auras. They all went for the save, went to the door, I went over there once I saw their auras and they just tbagged until they died. It’s not hard to pull off lol. E Z 4k😂😂
---
Top quality shitpost
---
Pretty much no one likes M1 Killers. With that being said Legion is basically just that one specific Killer that basically plays very cheap.
---
I like how he can vault over things but preferably old Legion was better than extremely slow vaulting Legion now.
---
His concept is OK but not close enough being good. In regards his power is already M1 attack but just with a slightly longer cool down, that's it.
---
Don't get me wrong on this, he can be good. But developers made him even more boring than ever and I have a hard time believing you'll get to somewhere by filling deviousness meter to maximum...
---
Body block exploit?
---
Sans
---
Hex memes are pretty good *cough*
---
Give immersed Claudette object of obsession as a free bonus perk.
---
I love the way that me saying I know how to use a chainsaw is somehow equivalent to me being a Billy main in your eyes. FYI, I don't usually play Billy unless it's my daily (that's usually how I pick who I'm playing), which means I haven't played him in over two weeks now. I think if I were to be considered a main of any killer it'd be Myers or Wraith. Legion, Nurse and Hag are the only killers I don't regularly play. The simple fact of the matter is, much like the insta-heal medkits, MoM costs you a whole lot of 10 seconds if you're any good in a chase. It has to be used by someone who knows exactly what they're doing (ie: using it in conjunction with Borrowed Time to unhook someone in the basement is the best use of it, but that's only necessary if you're camping anyway) in order to be anything more than the most minor inconvenience. In comparison to the previously mentioned insta-down perks and add-ons that killers have readily available, and the ability to straight up kill a survivor early with a mori or Devour Hope, survivors having *one* perk that allows them to take an extra hit for free isn't anything more than a mild inconvenience by anyone looking at the game as a whole rather than looking at one specific perk. So get off your high horse, and if you're so goddamn precious over your time use a method that counters it. Because me telling you to run insta-down perks, or moris, or play killers that have secondary attacks, is no less reasonable than "cleanse all the perks to counter NOED". There are counters, so if it bothers you that much, use them.
---
PS: A tetanus shot will stop you from getting tetanus. Amputating the injured appendage will stop you from getting tetanus. One is a much better solution. Borrowed Time is much more effective.
---
Do a survivor version &lt;3
---
These unfair/no counterplay posts are just whiney players who dont want to put in the work to learn or employ the counters.
---
Easier to whine at devs until they patch it than actually doing something.
---
How ez do you want your game to be?
---
Important game parts are broken? Wells that seems to be an odd rare occasion.
---
Did Nea and Laurie escape as well though? Won't count as a full save if Laurie didn't make it at least.
---
Oh ok, but is was just a reaction...
---
Yeah, at that rank half of them probably blundered and accidentally mori'd themselves.
---
Still, bet it was satisfying.
---
I feel Wraith would just quitely play along not knowing at all what he is doing.
---
we all escaped.
---
Theres this and killers who d/c when their totem gets cleansed instantly.
---
Dude rank reset just happened chill tf out
---
Wait, if I make a new account, bully a nooby killer, t bag and mock him, I can claim he is toxic right?
---
What is this new escape mechanic when you are the last person alive (the thing with the bar) - was it added recently? Does the hatch despawn when this mode turns on (First match after a long break)
---
I think it’s *probably* because of swf? I’m not sure though. I’m a purple-green rank killer (I switch between ranks 7-9 a lot) and I’ve gotten all purples at rank 9 before, but sometimes I also get 3 rank yellows and one green while I’m in the purple ranks. I seriously have no clue how matchmaking works.
---
Cheers.
---
I understand reset just happened but I don't just mean today I'm talking about all month
---
Yesu!
---
"I'm James A. Janisse and welcome to the Kill Count where we tally up the victims in all our favorite horror movies."
---
I find that a little shock therapy helps
---
Yeah I’m not reading all of that, NOED defenders always right a fucking novel defending it despite it being shitty.
---
NOED isn’t fun, encourages bad behavior, is imbalanced, punishes solo players and is useless with SWF, gives a free speed boost AND an insta down all because the killer sucked ass at stopping gens. Killers use it as a crutch and people defend it because BHVR sucks ass at buffing weaker killers, so we have to deal with a shitty perk because of their incompetence. 
---
These are all facts. Deal with it. While NOED is in the game, killers will be rewarded for failing and cause survivors to feel genuine frustration. There is absolutely no guarantee you will cleanse every totem with randoms, period, period.
---
Beard kinda helps that just a bit
---
NOED is earned when survivors don't do totems. At some point in the game, you should be able to figure out what perks the killer is running. Are you sloppied? One out of four. Are you under the effects of Ruin? Two out of four. Etc. Etc. If you're up against an M1 killer and you can't figure out what they're running, cleanse the totems, they're probably running Ruin. The culprits are usually the same killers every time. It's not rocket science.
---
What's more is that NOED really shouldn't work as well as it does. But for some reason, instead of finding NOED and breaking it, survivors love running at hooked or slugged survivors while it's up. If you can't find it, just leave ffs. NOED complainers are just a bunch of potatoes. NOED is basically the answer to 4 survivors running Adrenaline. Anybody arguing about how "deserved" a heal or instadown is basically a potato.
---
Is there pallet looping?
---
I didn't mean it like that sorry if I didn't word if correctly what I meant is players who have the skill level of purple or red but are actually ranked 14 or 15
---
Do it!
---
That's the point, whoever finds it first wins the hatch game.
---
that goes against every horror movie ever. the last one alive is almost guaranteed to survive because they out smarted the killer. if anything they should be entitled to escape
---
Ohhh. Yeah that’s just rank reset, I think. Or sometimes really good players don’t play for a while so when they come back, their rank’s back to square one.
---
Opinion: The Plague has the plague
---
these is a facts Op.
---
Umm, just for the record everyone in B tier can still counter Mettle of man if you know how to play these Killers.
---
Heck, why Nurse being in B tier? She can easily ignore Sprint Bursts or Sprint Burst from Mettle of man hit and just down the person.
---
wut
---
Thank you so much! I just need to decide on a skin to get now because this will be my secondary killer I believe!
---
Welcome to DbD you know what you signed up for continuing to play this trash
---
You can Loop, yes. 😂
---
I had a Meg on my team use an escape cake and she had 1600 points at the end of the match. Rank reset is great
---
you wont be saying that when the survivor that just got unhooked is on death hook and there's 1 gen left and all 4 survivors are still alive and OH GOD OH FUCK
---
personally I prefer enduring over noed
---
Bias? Dude you guys literally lost the trial. You want BHVR to hold your hand the entire game?
---
Autodidact, IE “How to sandbag even when the killer is nowhere near you.”
---
Nice. I have a friend who's name is usually hex: devour ass.
---
why are all of your words registered as spelled wrong?
---
100% agree its stupid as to why its like that
---
How do the Wraith addons work if you use both the one that suppresses your terror radius when you come out of cloak, and the one that always has terror radius up even when cloaked? Do you actually gain some temporary terror suppression?
---
smurfing is a thing in every game, not much can be done
---
agree
---
Lockers are the best, in my opinion, but if you don't like them, there are some alternatives.
---
If I am at a gen, I usually just squat behind it, so the gen is between me and the hook.
---
If I am not near a gen, I'll either walk/run in one direction, and change my direction 4 or 5 seconds later.
---
Possibly an unpopular alternative is to make it look like you're doing nothing, or walking around aimlessly. Killers want either easy targets, or to pressure people who look like they are working on gens or unhooking other survivors. If you look like you're doing nothing compared to your teammates, or in a more difficult spot for them to reach, they might ignore you.
---
From my experience as killer, the time begins as soon as the hook happens. The killer really needs to look around right away to find the auras. If they do anything else, they'll likely miss them. As a survivor, expect that there is a small delay between when the hook actually happened, and when you hear/see it. I usually start moving to counter BBQ as soon as the downed survivor is picked up.
---

"Colonel Mustard with the chandelier in the bedroom !"

"It's not fucking Cluedo dude..."
---
What a horrible hex placment, they should fix it 0/10 - Lisa Sherwood
---
A good killer can wipe that shit off the face of the earth. 
---
DS was infuriating because you got the satisfaction of downing them and then had to suffer both the stun and the pickup time. 
---
I am in no way saying MoM isn't broken. But the statement that is better and worse to play against is just false. I disagree with punishing the killer for existing but I'd take a few extra seconds of chase and down over 8 seconds of waiting and then a chase.
---
tl;dr: DS would waste way more time then MoM and therefore it is not better.
---
They walk to dodge a phasing spirit anyway, it's one of the best ways to juke her. If they just keep running without even doubling back on themselves, you won't need Predator anyway.
---
I honestly think the pallet vaulting gets to newer players
---
This reminded me of that one picture of the guy staring at someone with binoculars with one of his hands on his crotch.
---
Just... Staring...
---
Wait Stridor is pretty good on Spirit
---
its a good perk i think its great with urban evasion never put down scratch marks and always know when the killer is coming
---
a lot of the "no counter play" perks do have counter play though
---
👀 bing bongs repeatedly
---
well i mean if you use it to hit them and then stay in it while they run away faster all you have to do is stop it once their speed boost is gone.
---
Lmao this game becomes more and more toxic every update
---
hiding in a locker wont prevent the killer from seeing you, it doesnt show your aura just your location
---
&gt; NOED isn't earned and more often then not it rewards them with a kill at the crucial end game collapse plus they mostly camp the hook with said NOED to secure the kill.
---
Hey killer, all the gens are powered and all the exits are open, can you let my friend Jimmy off the hook now. Hurr durr.
---
Seems there’s little cliques downvoting things that aren’t in agreement with toxic mentality
---
A few of the killer cast has alternate damage forms that can seriously hinder MoM’s gaining stacks. The instadown cast (Billy, LF, Myers), The “I only need one M1” Cast (Plague, Huntress, Legion) and a special mention to Trapper because picking someone up who gets trapped will either gain 0 stacks if they were healthy or only one if you swung at them prior to trapping. 
---
Outside of that we have perk counterplay for the other killers too. Make Your Choice can really hinder people with MoM from making risky plays unless they want to stay injured all game which plays right into your favor. A lesser pick would be Hex Haunted Grounds just because of a limited duration and if they never cleanse the totems, you’re kinda boned there too. Lastly but weakest of the options is Rancor. If you want to combo this with something like STBFL (and you should tbh) it becomes much better because the extra health state power can be mitigated by how fast you recover with full stacks.
---
Yea I get it. But one bad timed DS isn’t why I lost that game. It is what it is in that situation.
---
I'd say pretty much every killer suffers from MoM. Billy, huntress, plague and legion suffer less from it though
---
is the playerbase on ps4 big enough to enjoy this game? Or should i just buy the game on pc
---
Why Legion?
---
I doubt, it's one Killer that can counter pallets and vaults and that was and will be his original idea made by the devs unless they heavily change it into something else. Otherwise if you stun Legion you get yourself fair amount of seconds to run away even if he/she has Enduring.
---
And the only thing that makes Legion countered overall is... and I sadly have to say this but doing 360's or so to say abuse Survivors' hitboxes.
---
Or even doing a quick circle thus plainly colliding through to vault back to the pallet. That's the counter play...
---
This would be better if Legion wasn't actually fun and a sold killer now
---
They are all over the reddit.
---
Better than angrypug
---
I always used their power for tracking and for a soft stall game. The momentum from frenzy is a little more tolerable now and it’s more satisfying when you get a hit off because if you miss you will lose frenzy.  You’re also not forced to stay into frenzy now. You can either hit the same survivor twice or miss intentionally. Overall it takes more skill now and you can use your power in more creative ways. At least imo.
---
&gt;no mither
---
&gt;overpowered tier
---
what did he mean by this?
---
Laughs in spirit
---
Well at least you're honest about your laziness. I'll give you that.
---
&gt; These are all facts
---
Actually, those are all your opinions. You seem to blur the lines between the two, as well as being too stupid or too lazy to actually defend them with any real factual data.
---
But hey, anything to keep up the anti-killer circle jerk right?
---
PC would let you have access to the PTB before new chapters come out and has a bigger player base but on PS4/Xbox god tier nurses are few and far between and 360's are easy peasy to pull off.
---
I hadn’t played in a week or so, tried to get on yesterday and a pop up said that game files had been changed and to go to the files to confirm they had not been changed. Something to that effect, and then the game closed. Anyone have this issue?
---
not everyone has bought every killer.
---
YOU'LL NEVER SHINE IF YOU DON'T GLOW
---
Sees title...
---
*Laughs in Iron Maiden*
---
Last Patch added the endgame collapse.  When the bar runs out all survivors still in the trial die.  The Killer now can close the hatch which immediately powers up the exit gates.  On the flip side, no matter how many generators were completed the hatch will always spawn and the killer no longer can grab you before you jump into it, ending the era of the dreaded hatch stand off.
---
Rookie mistake, don't use premium offerings on rank reset.
---
First time?
---
Yes he counters pallets which is why I think newer players do not like him
---
Looks like shrek imo
---
It’s called the endgame collapse and is triggered when there’s one survivor left and the hatch is closed (which will power the exit gates) or when the exit gates are opened the bar on top is a timer and if it runs out the entity kills you. The hatch will always spawn when there’s only one survivor left as well.
---
&gt;NOED is earned when survivors don't do totems
---
That's not you doing anything to earn it, you could sit in a corner and afk all game and it will so trigger. More importantly all this pressure is put on survivors to do totems to prevent Noed yet there is so little emphasis put on them as objectives. That's why when a totem is meant to house a hex perk, it's tied to a lit totem. There's no totem counter, small game is garbage, etc. No emphasis is put on cleansing totems, dulls in particular. 
---
&gt; If you're up against an M1 killer and you can't figure out what they're running, cleanse the totems, they're probably running Ruin. The culprits are usually the same killers every time. It's not rocket science.
---
The culprits can be any killer. Moreover you know how it was bullshit that you had to assume every Survivior was running decisive strike if one was the obsession? Yeah guess what, it's bullshit that you have to assume every killer has NOED until the post game screen or until you get insta downed. 
---
&gt;What's more is that NOED really shouldn't work as well as it does. It's not a good perk. You're sacrificing one whole early or midgame perk and laying it all down for the end game.
---
It's a poorly designed perk. It's not good bc Surviviors at higher ranks are usually better at looping and know when to escape, making NOED a crutch for bad killers to rank up with. Since totems aren't a major focus the lower down you go. 
---
&gt;That's risky and not practical
---
That's the point of a hex totem. If it can't be 100% removed, it's OP. Imagine if Devour hope, Ruin, Huntresses lullaby, or Third seal had no totem tied to it, all of those perks would easily be broken. Noed is no different, that's why it was reworked (I argue it should have been deleted but whatever). 
---
&gt;NOED complainers are just a bunch of potatoes.
---
Then so are Adrenaline complainers. 
---
&gt;Anybody arguing about how "deserved" a heal or instadown is is basically a potato.
---
Then you should be on the Frontlines Calling for nerfs to devour hope, haunted ground, Noed, Bubba, Billy, Make your Choice, Iron Maiden, I-head, Tuft of hair, T3 Myers, Tombstone, Styptic, Hem Syringe, and Adrenaline. 
---
Side note. Only 3 of those things are insta heals while the rest are insta downs.
---
I was face camped on my first hook twice last night. Including one game when there were 3 bloody part streamers in player. Did one gen, one totem, then chased and face-camped. Of course, killer has NoEd so she manages to knock down two people who come to rescue me during end game. 
---
After the match, the killer had the gall to rave about all the blood points they got (2 kills, one DC). Totally undeserved points. I got 9300 BP. Had to turn the game off after that.
---
That’s a powerful axe
---
Nice shot, people are probably going to get triggered because of iri head though
---
You’ll get addons to the green medkit with ace in the hole.
---
If you do that, you become semi reverse Wraith. You’ll have terror radius in stealth and a brief no TR when coming out.
---
This isn't an opinion though, it's a fact. Her stun noise is even cuter
---
Lol that is the exact face I pull too, such disappointment lol :’)
---
Bah you discovered my weakness! :D
---
“Anti killer circle jerk” 
---
This is the only perk I’ve ever complained about. Not because it is OP, but because it sucks to play against solo. It’s frustrating and far too dependent on complete strangers to do totems. Which is why a totem counter would be nice. But your precious immersion would be ruined... I guess. Lol.
---
Distortion is the perk you’re looking for. If you get a token consumer when someone gets hooked you know they have BBQ and then you have two more chances to get to a locker before you get spotted out.
---
I hope you die isn't a death threat
---
All he did was give himself legacy because he got the save deletion bug behavior hadn’t fixed for years and lost all his old legacy.
---
Green Kit with addons on first search. Tested and confirmed.
---
The victims included 2 teabagging Claudettes, 1 disconnecting Meg, and a Quentin of indeterminate gender.  With a run time of 17.8 minutes due to end game slugging and immersion, that leaves us with a kill on average every 4.45 minutes.  I’ll give the Golden Chainsaw award to Claudette 2.  After blending into the corner for five minutes straight, getting moried just before she could cleanse the Devour Hope was just the sweetest thing.  Dull machete for lamest kill will go to Meg, because seriously, either don’t disconnect or don’t play you sore losers.  And that’s it.  **Trap Daddy: The Great Collapse** Came out in May of 2019 and grossed an impressive 62,400 bloodpoints.  Thanks so much for watching, be good people!
---
Depip squads. Do what you can, but honestly the only way to get through it is to learn and adapt. The learning curve gets pretty damn steep when you have depip squads rolling around terrorizing rank 14 killers, but you *can* beat them. Honestly I only really ever see this at rank reset, but it is rather common
---
i thought this was a shitpot at first lol
---
You think all good players log in and start playing the second rank reset happens? Some people take a break, some people casually play. While some purposely depip, that’s not always the case. You’ll always encounter good and bad players across all ranks.
---
I really only use it on the toxic survivors that I met previously so it doesn't really bother me. But thanks :D
---
Pig dash is hard counter to MoM.
---
r/woooosh
---
Its fun to bully killers that suck at the game, its like joining in a street basketball game being the best one there and dunking on everyone. Especially fun since all low ranked killers run toxic add ons and apparantly live across the world with their 300 ping
---
Oh, in that case others have no reason to get triggered. Welcome :)
---
so you have run into few salty survivors and few salty killers?
---
Still, its sick
---
Moris with devour hope are straight up satisfying unlike Moris.
---
How do you message players? I can't find a way on PC without adding them first
---
I apologize for playing him. I hate him but I’m new and need to level him to 40 for his perks :(
---
Beucase its not meant to give the killer insta win, its meant to make it more difficult for the survivor to escape since he also failed one more thing... they added the power up of gates exactly for that, another chance at escaping albeit not a free escape.
---
Key.
---
I could watch these all day.
---
Oof a top minds tard. Easy block.
---
If it's that big of a deal, then do the totems yourself. Keep a mental track of how many you've finished.
---
Honestly, it isn't hard.
---
Totem counter is just spoonfeeding you information and taking away from everything the game is supposed to be. You want to bash it, and you hope shouting it down will mask the fact that you're just lazy and want your hand held because you hate NOED.
---
Not particularly hard to decipher.
---
In that case noed is franklins demise for me
---
Mine was also teaching my BF how to play. He got face camped because he was getting carried and all the killers hexes got destroyed. I got hit while saving. They got hit, borrowed time, we escape. I normally wouldn't be proud of a relatively normal escape but he was super proud of me and it made me feel really good about myself :)
---
He can only vault while in frenzy. While that seems scary, it’s basically useless. To actually down you he has to chase you forever with frenzy or take the fatigue. As soon as he fatigues, guess what? You can vault the pallet and he can’t.
---
I’m more disturbed by left handed mouse than no monitor.
---
Inspired by that one scene from Scary Movie 
---
&gt;!There's also a hidden Myers somewhere!&lt;
---
Perks that counter killer perks labeled as "no counter play"
---
Overwhelming presence = streetwise
---
Spies from the shadows = calm spirit
---
Remember me = wake up
---
(Kinda of counter)
---
Iron grip/agitation = boil over/ filp-flop
---
Predator = lightweight/poised
---
If anyone can explain how these aren't counters, please do
---
or perhaps minus Ids, so that its an even bigger punishment?
---
Try to bamboozle her rather than loop her?
---
Why are you not shadow banned
---
New Legion is only slightly better because not everyone tunnels now. It’s still frustrating to be on a tiny map with a Legion running from one side of the map to the other at mach 2. (Billy can do the same, but you can at least hear him coming and jump out of the way to avoid the chainsaw.) And unlike Billy, if Legion is having a hard time finding people, just sprint around until you spot someone, slap their ass through a window, and now you can see everyone else inside your (new and improved) larger terror radius.
---
I have to talk myself down from DCing every Legion game.
---
I’d put myers into the cheating camp.  Have you seen **Halloween 4**?  The dude literally got both of his eyeballs shot out in **Halloween 2** and then just decided “Nope.  Didn’t happen.  GG.”  He’s like that kid who keeps “forgetting” the rules whenever they don’t go his way, but can and will whip out the official rules Q&amp;A pdf on his phone and point to the exact passage that screws over other players on a technicality.
---
Imagine having that low self esteem and using noed lol
---
Thanks my dude :D These are some of the most satisfying shots for me
---
Terror radius doesn't affect instinct anymore the old speed boost add-ons do now
---
Legion should be S tier, MoM literally doesn’t work if you have deep wounds on.
---
This is false as survivors will still be able to tell where he is when he appears and disappears. It’s not long enough.
---
Not really a question but a consensus. Does anyone else think rotating perk availability would be a good idea? It’s sort of a luxury of people who’ve been playing a long time, but seeing every survivor with adrenaline or every killer with bbq or ruin just gets so boring. 
---
There are tons of underused perks and I’d love for the top picked perks to either be rotated out or nerfed so that the unsung heroes would shine more. Maybe perk bans with character specific perks still being available to that character to encourage a difference between survivors and heighten the strength of lower tier killers like Leatherface.
---
I’m spitballing but I feel like this could have some cool interactions and make for more challenging games other than hiding in a locker for 4 seconds every time a friend gets downed.
---
do it
---
So tired of playing against Hillbilly.
---
Truly
---
That can happen with a lot of steam games. Simply verify your game files under the properties - local files tab. Should clear it up.
---
Yayyy
---
Happened today to me. The Claudette was a tad too far from the exit. Karma is a biatch
---
I suspect nea is pretty hung.
---
Distressing on Doc.
---
Wait really ? I didn’t see it mentionned anywhere in the patch notes. Then why do I still see Legions with M&amp;A ?
---
&gt; be best killer in the game
---
&gt;absolutely god like in certain hands
---
&gt;can’t even down a survivor without a third stun time
---
Though I dont agree with dodging on either side, if the killer can remember old toxic players they played against and dodge, then survivors should be able to do the same.
---
Monto: *misses*
---
Also Monto: "he has a dead hard"
---
Confident badass.... is that why she started losing tourneys and became a shut in? Because confidence?
---
Yes difficult. Not *impossible*.
---
I blame console frames and lag. Sometimes I physically can’t hit the great skill check because of those two reasons. I’ll hit L1 exactly on the great skill check and I end up somehow hitting it near the middle. Sometimes the frames drop and it jumps as well. It’s just better to tap at this point because I’d rather no attempt. Under good frames and connections I can do it easily though.
---
I really don’t understand the meme about corn being hard to find people in.
---
Maybe because I play in Ultra Quality, but I always am able to consistently follow survivors through it, and even blatantly watch them crouch and sit still in the middle of it, as if I’m dumb enough to just walk by them. I find it’s easier if you watch the corn stalks rustle/move and start to listen more closely for footsteps. 
---
Anyone playing in lower quality have a screenshot to share maybe?
---
Jesus that would be OP for the survivors. If a SWF group joined with three people all with that perk and a green tool box and just hid in a corner and waited for the random to die, they would absolutely melt all of the generators.
---
My bro does smurf and I find this so annoying. He says "so he can have fun" but I have plenty of fun as a red rank killer.
---
How can you use new Frenzy in more creative ways?  You can't really pinball around survivors since you're so slow in Frenzy now, you can't run ahead of people and end your power to block areas since you are too slow and fatigued for too long, and while it was criticized you could choose to just stay in Frenzy to slowly down one person.  The change removed all of the power's options and made Frenzy "get a first hit, then become an M1 killer".  I really don't see how anyone could find Legion's power more fun to use now when all they did was make it notably slower and worse in almost every regard
---
Ace is the perfect human being. None of the other survivors even come close
---
I should waah. Dude just stop. There’s no I in team. Your team lost the trial therefore you aren’t entitled to shit. Go play rainbow pony adventures online if you want an easy win. It’s babies like you that cry about every single challenge and change and refuse to adapt.
---
Yes I am aware but taking a step back won't always save your chase
---
You get hit, down you go, even if you weren't injured.
---
I’m on ps4 so it’s different for me, idk anything on pc sorry :(
---
You’re just bad at the game if you can’t easily counter Nurse’s Calling lol
---
Oh ok I get it now. Guys every Survivior is now expected to bring a key and if you don't then it's your fault the rest of your team died while you were doing what you were supposed to do
---
Was this made by a salty survivor main? I bet it is.
---
DC'ing because of a map is ALWAYS WRONG.  Doesn't matter what side of the game you play.
---
When you “mindgame” a survivor in the dream transition it’s because they messed up, not because you mind games them.
---
Imagine if the Trapper gets stunned at a pallet and just whips out an industrial-grade bulky flashlight and blinds the survivors and teabags.
---
Hypocrisy at its' finest.  Got to love it.
---
Wouldn't Botany Knowledge counter Sloppy Butcher's slowing of heal time?
---
Pig&gt;wraith
---
Take breaks my dude. I got similar Freddy players and Billy players all morning. Death over and over. I literally thought “Why the hell do I even bother to play this game anymore?” And that’s when I knew it was time to get off and do something else lol. Feel better man.
---
Even though it would most likely require some number changes, I feel like left behind should effect all survivors actions to make it useful for Endgame. So you could open the exit gates quicker, loot quicker, break totems quicker, stuff like that once hatch is shut
---
Imagine needing crutches and using MoM, Adrenaline, Balanced landing and self care
---
Then by that logic endgame builds should not exist. Bc if Surviviors don't get second chances neither should killers
---
I agree with you I have more fun when I'm playing with people of my level as both killer and survivor I like a challenge and I'm more than happy to admit when I'm am beaten in a fair game
---
You realize that survivors leaving immediately after opening the exit gate is like the worst surv play you can make
---
Jeff is the biggest boye and therefore deserves the most love.
---
I mean, franklin's
---
Imagine putting someone down for using something in the game lol
---
I’m on console, but I prefer being rank 1 survivor and killer as the games are much more challenging. The killers are still fairly diverse IMO.
---
They should make it boost door opening speed, then it might actually be useful.
---
Why would you run lullaby if the notification sounds irritate you? The whole point is that it would cause survivors to miss skill checks and trigger that sound.
---
Could also make it so that you have to be the last survivor for it to activate.
---
&gt;endgame collapse implemented
---
&gt;remove all endgame abilities from killer
---
&gt;endgame collapse is no longer even an endgame
---
Feels BHVR man
---
agreed. Legion is annoying, but that's it. no reason to complain.
---
They only cost 4K bloodpoints it’s not a big deal at all if they get wasted
---
I also condemn survivors who DC over who the killer is
---
Its mostly about rotation rather than going 2m away
---
Love the tattoo David has behind his ear tbh
---
I use when I see a SWK that I suspect will all be stacking multiple tank perks per person. sure enough, they all seem to have Mettle Of Man, Dead hard, Adrenaline, and combos of Decisive/Borrowed time. sure is a shame that MoM now gives me an incentive to tunnel non-obsessions, but hey, I didn't choose their loadout.
---
Cries in ps4
---
Everyone has weak moments, so what? Just look at the  quotes on her perks and her constant smile when she’s  waiting for the trial to begin.
---
It’s so weird how basically every online community makes it out to be horrible and toxic 100% of the time. I can probably count on my left hand how many toxic players I’ve had in endgame chat. Meanwhile I can’t even count on both my hands how many players I’ve had say something nice beyond gg after a game.
---
hOrRibLe uSe oF a PaLlEt
---
no shit.
---
Her squeak tho. So adorable ;; I always get disappointed when I don’t killer stun her cause then I don’t get to hear the squeak ):
---
Ghostface&gt;pig
---
Y u hatin' on bubba?
---
it really saddens me they don’t implement more Mori perks, it’s really satisfying to pull off a Mori that feels deserved based of the effort you put forward to achieving it
---
As a last resort. Just like how a survivor can recover from being downed.
---
I enjoy Haddonfield as killer, I play Huntress and Spirit
---
Autodidact is a perk that Adam Francis starts with, it basically makes so that every time you succeed a healing skillcheck while healing an ally, every future skillcheck will grant bonus progress (like hitting a great skillcheck except wayyyyy better). However, this "bonus" starts at a negative number, so for the first half of the match Adam just runs around digging his fingers into people's injuries.
---
You have my attention
---
Do you like hurting people?
---
yes...wow im still learning this game. This community has toxic people like in Naruto striker. wow.
---
Reset plagues one week of each month. Then other people derank for entertainment. It's kind of the shittiest part of the game.
---
It couldn't have worked for you because it doesn't work for anyone, you can unset read-only and it won't change anything other than allowing the game to write to that file, any changes that you set that the game won't allow it will simply ignore those lines and use default ones instead. The  "read-only" setting only means that the file can't be overwritten, the idea that it somehow forces the game to use the settings inside is wrong because it can't. 
---
This is why you can have a 100% empty GameUserSettings.ini and set it to "read-only" and play the game. It will startup with all default lines and you can play and change settings in the game, it just won't save those settings after you shut down the game.
---
Anything that you think is happening can be done without setting "read-only".
---
I honestly think you could mesh two of those together to create a balanced, and yet not op perk
---
Such as:
---
Aura reading no matter the range, until leaving injured state. Suffer from mangled and hindered status when within killers heartbeat radius. Cannot instantly heal a health state.
---
Well low ranks are also where high rank killers/survivors end up after a few months away, due to rank resets.
---
You forgot the shitpost flair
---
Yeah he should probably be slower than 113%
---
He's the fake hero that ends up joining the party, but is put into the role of comic relief after a super OP fight early on in the series.
---
~~Basically what I'm saying is that Leatherface is Jean Pierre Polnareff. And basically what I mean by that is I want a Leatherface cosmetic that gives him a silver flat top.~~
---
Boo-fucking-hoo.
---
my bad. I thought I clicked
---
Killer
---
Was playing pig (I’m not the best killer, rank 14) and went against a very toxic SWF. 2 of them were Janes and they teabagged me at every pallet, pointed, etc. they crushed me and all escaped fairly quickly. Next match I play pig again, see it’s the same SWF. Decide to burn Amanda’s Letter on Lery’s. 4K.
---
Survivor
---
My bf and I were doing SWF and playing with 2 randoms. It was a nasty spirit. She was insanely good. We were on Haddonfield and 2 randoms die with 2 gens left. Bf had brought a key and I say to him “Lets run to the end of the street and see if hatch is there” I was leading and he was behind me, we were both injured. Spirit finds us and is chasing bf. We get super close to the hatch and as she’s about to him, I get in between them and she hits me while my MoM is active. He opens hatch and we both escape together. That was fun
---
Thanks mate. How long did it take?
---
Calm spirit might be situational but i'll be damned if it hasn't saved me before
---
Dude Long story short, I am not gonna change my killer main for avoiding mom, it's pretty fucked that it favors top tier killers like Billy and huntress, plus stbfl is so shit and situational with these dcs as sometimes my obsession dcs and the perk turns to shit.
---
But I really appreciate the reply.
---
I hate Feng Min for sounding like a chew toy whenever she gets hit. It's such a weird sound to have
---
What was surveillance like before the buff?
---
A lot of times a Survivor that died has left to find their next match already. Don't read into it too much,  I say.
---
That actually doesn't look bad
---
I'm gonna assume it's not a woooosh and got for it. He's talking about Jeff Johansen.
---
Drake
---
The only thing I get salty at in that game is ganking and light spam shinobi but I never go out of my way and say stuff like that
---
What have you done
---
“I want a free escape every trial the killer can do nothing about”
---
Sounds balanced
---
you really are tryin lol. if the hatch was closed that means one person is left (unless it was opened with a key). with one person left you cant activate bloodwarden because there is nobody left to hook. good try though and i know everyone still agrees with you anyway
---
Didn’t know pig could dash to deny stacks, thanks
---
I've started to adapt to breaking a totem after I pop a gen making sure I get 3 done before the second to last gen is done unless they are running ruins then at that point I just break ruin and do gens
---
Not what I'm saying
---
I'm saying I'm bored of every killer just dragging out the game to see the animation. It's just unfun
---
Did they fix it so a nurse blink counts as M1?
---
You dont understand what I'm talking about at all.
---
I'll double check my settings but right now I find it impossible to see more than a couple of metres ahead unless the survivor has explicitly flashy clothing.
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/75PvWFZ.png) is what corn looked like to me when I retroactively recorded the game to get that screenshot in the drawing. I even found out the survivor wasn't in the corn, I just flicked my camera towards them and back again without realising they were there.
---
I've never understood how to look for rustling stalks when they're so high up and you need to be constantly on the move. I unfortunately can't listen for footsteps because half the game is already too loud to put the volume up.
---
A few days after I sent what they asked for but I think they forgot at 1st cause after I asked did I sent the right info it was there within a day but the initial reply was after I opened the ticket if I was u I would say u lost more points then u did to get more

BHahahahahqhah😂😂💀💀
---
Oh good. MoM is bullshit sometimes but if it's going to exist it shouldn't be yet another thing Nurse can ignore.
---
This made me laugh
---
I quit burning those offerings just because everytime I did, I'd usually spawn within terror radius and be found less than thirty seconds into the match.
---
Laughs in hatchet hitboxes hitting you in mid air
---
not notification sounds. not two or three. repetitive vaulting, gen hopping, Thrill tapping. when it's in a row many times. if just several notification sounds at random times were triggering my migraines, i wouldn't play the game at all.
---
What will you say to ashy slashy ash?
---
This scene is from Scary Movie right? THAT MEANS!! MEANS!! Brenda will be the survivor PLEASE!!
---
Then cleanse totems
---
How does Rancor not have a counter?
---
Distortion?
---
That's what it was. Look that up. Its an audio meme lol.
---
But... it literally can't.

I just take noed for dailies or achievements. Why work harder just work smarter?

In hindsight I probably should have saved it for when I had a squad, but I was feeling lucky

Me: burns "the game" offering every time
---
Drake...where's the exit hole?
---
Off topic kinda but I wish we had some cosmetic options for the hatchets
---
&gt; But you are not slow in Frenzy now. It's 120% of survivor's movement speed.
---
You're too slow to be able to hit multiple survivors unless they're all very close.  The increased duration doesn't really compensate for the decreased speed for here (which is why I assume they even increased the duration)  
---
I liked playing Legion before as hitting as many Survivors I can, then using my power to close the distance on someone and/or block them from key areas and ending my power to potentially get a hit.  Sort of like a pseudo-Wraith with the ability to slow down other survivors.  But now after all the nerfs to Frenzy with the only compensation being default speed, Legion is just full-on a worse Wraith in most scenarios.  
---
They could've fixed the exploitable stuff without going overboard on everything else
---
Ah yea I see what you mean. Can be kind of lame sure, but there’s been plenty of matches (any killer will vouch) where killers had to wait around easily up to 10 minutes while the survivor snuck to the hatch. Paybacks a bitch!
---
Steam library.

Right click the game.

I had this happen to me before. Do not go to BHVR, their customer service regarding this is actually shit
---
its christmas time
---
I definitely disagree with self care being a crutch. IMO, it encourages you to hide and spend far too much time healing with the reduced heal time. Pair that with the fact that there are a number of killers you shouldn’t or can’t even heal against (Legion, Plague) and I think there are other much better perks to run instead of it. A med kit usually works just fine if you want to heal, and most survivors have tons of those stocked up by this point. Most people who run self care these days are the immersed gamers who run it with urban, sprint burst and spine chill
---
May I suggest the Dropout set for Frank (I think that's what it's called)? It's the red letterman jacket with the camo pants. Or if you are up to waiting, the new neon Joey set also looks awesome.
---
AAAAH-URRRRRR!
---
The hitboxes on Flee The Facility are fucking ridiculous
---
I mean I gotta do it cause it’s Saw.
---
Oink oink!
---
Plus she is hawt
---
If it's really that bad. Disable messaging from randoms, re-enable after your done
---
Well, that's like the only option there is
---
Either that or you die instantly as the hatch is closed
---
Would you prefer that?
---
I just wished they put more thought and effort into changing how remember me works because of this update, they just did a flat nerf on the off chance its active when there's one survivor left, why cant they just create a condition where the more survivors alive, the more time remember puts onto the door. or if they're REALLY lazy they can keep it the same but "if one survivor alive remember me is not active" like wtf devs
---
We all love piggy and every pig main has to be respected and receive honors from surv and killer mains
---
yes. I'm just not the kind of person to magnify the 1 bad game I have over the dozens of good games I have
---
The time you are in the power is actually VERY long compared to before, you can run across some maps without addons. They bumped him up to regular killer speed, so he can chase now without using his power to constantly catch back up.
---
I can understand your frustration about the power, but when you get I off it’s actually easier to:
---
Frenzy into M1
---
Rather than 
---
M1 Chase chase chase M1
---
Also legion has the added bonus of locating people if he can get a FF hit and if you are accurate and lucky, you can get all 4 = run back to someone you already hit them down them. Now people have to mend AND heal because you have max killer speed, so you won’t always come in with feral but rather you can simply down them if survivors don’t want to heal. ~~Aside from the fact that all of his addons are fucking horrendous outside of his iridescent one~~ He seems ok 👌🏾.
---
Edit: sorry for the fucking word wall🍭
---
Since the first tier is a joke, let me just ask, How are the best survivor perks in the game Iron will, OOO, and spin chill? Why is bond above every exhaustion perk (Other then adren) why is dead hard above BL and Lithe, why is Light weight better then DS, SC. Why is hope worse then SB and Urban evasion. This entire tier list reeks p3 immersed claud
---
&gt; They could've fixed the exploitable stuff without going overboard on everything else
---
Or they couldn't. It's not always that easy
---
But personally I like new Legion more by many reasons
---
*Hits blunt*
---
Not at all what OP is saying but way to mischaracterize it.
---
Myers as well. Maybe Clown with Pinky Finger. He may also be counting the upcoming killer.
---
Yeah, unfortunately getting face camped in solo queue is a death sentence unless you have a hero player. Most people aren't heroes. I try and play with the assumption that I'm going to get hard proxied on my first hook because it takes them 3-4 gens to get that hook.
---
If someone else is getting face camped I usually end up trading to get the person out if its the endgame, because I'm greedy for WGLF. Backfired on me once with Blood Warden. Otherwise I try and bait the killer into a chase so someone else can get the unhook.
---
Legion: I also wear black all the time, sit in the corner of a room to watch everyone and like to work alone.
---
This is a M rated game you know that right
---
Survivor sits at the exit gate not leaving: "omg wtf all these survivors are so toxic!"
---
Killer slugs to make you wait out the timer: "yea well the survivor probably deserved it"
---
So instead of just ending the imbalance the killer main solution is to...swing it the other direction. 
---
See this is why I hate being a killer main. I'm forced to have to disavow this shit.
---
I wouldn’t even say you need Stridor with Spirit if you have good headphones and turn your volume up all the way. Obviously not an option for everyone, but it can save you a perk slot
---
Whispers honestly agitates me more than most of these other perks on the bottom. Its frustrating to watch the killer make those signature movements that scream whispers which almost always forces you into a dangerous position
---
Surviviors didn't like hatch standoffs either lol
---
Pig: You are in front of the king, he says he has a quest for you
---
Legion: I want to kill the king
---
Pig: What?
---
Legion: I said I want to kill the king
---
Pig: What for?
---
Lwgion: So I can become the king
---
Infectious Fright on nurse is pretty damn good right now too
---
Oh no im gonna have to wait 2 minutes???!!! That’s crazy!!! You’re right, you should let the killer wait all the time you want while standing on top of the hatch like the old times! That was fair!
---
You’re just getting a little, minuscule taste of your own medicine :)
---
I'd like for them to force exit gates to spawn on opposite ends of the map, no more of this RNG "you can see one Gate from the other" shit.
---
Dude Doc would so cheat at chess.
---
I move Pawn e2-e4... *shock* Dammit stop that!
---
Is there a canon explanation for why megan has that mask?
---
i’m not sure,  but with a bit of deduction there’s a pattern, “mettle of man-claudette” then “noEd-nurse” instead of the perk itself, but since some excuse i dont understand, the Op just added her main perk to resemble her(?)
---
This is what I wanted.
---
Have some of my booty, m8ty!
---
&gt;not a P3 Immersed Claudette
---
That's just what a P3 Immersed Claudette would say.
---
Right below "GG ez noob killer"
---
&gt; *A reminder of a bloody good time when people came together, but left screaming.*
---
That's one of the main reasons so many people 99% gates.
---
I'm just saying all the advantages you have as killer in the endgame.
---
Wazzzzzuuuuuppppp
---
I don't play with SWF much so it feels big in solo. I know when you can coordinate its redundant but I feel that other players dont respect healing enough. 
---
What would you consider top tier?
---
:)
---
apex not destroying their game with next patch xd nice bait man
---
this guys knows what's what
---
Nurse's calling &amp; Mettle of Man? Really, what makes nurse's so toxic to play against; once you know they have it you legit don't heal in the terror radius and MoM gets countered by half the killers in the game.
---
most of those "uncounterable" killer perks are in fact designed to counter survivor plays that take advantage of spamming certain tactics. Like enduring and brutal strength are useful against survivors who take advantage of infinite pallet looping, and even then it only lessens the effectiveness of that. 
---
perks that alter the terror radius are countered by being careful and aware of your surrounding instead of expecting the radius to do it for you, and most are only situational and used by specific killers. 
---
franklin's intself is a counter, and is countered by going back for your item later or being good enough to avoid getting hit. 
---
sloppy butcher merely delays you. 
---
deerstalker? dont get downed, and if someone on your team is downed, dont draw the killer's attention before the pickup, and make sure to heal someone who's slugged. 
---
discordance? dont double up on gens, especially against Legion. 
---
bamboozle? it's a counter, and just loop in a different direction. 
---
seriously complaining about Spies from the shadows? dont run near crows, fool, or use calm spirit. 
---
hangman's trick counters an abusive survivor strategy, and even then the survivor is still likely to wiggle free before the hook respawns. and to be used well it needs iron grasp, another counter, and now the killer has used two perks slots to counter a strategy that's very hard to predict outside special hook events. likewise with Agitation. in fact, none of these three is very good without at least one of the others.
---
surveillance? another counter to gen rush. play musical gens. it only slows the game, not ends it. same with Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
overwhelming presence? another counter to gen rush. OBVIOUSLY DONT WASTE YOUR ITEM CHARGES IN THE TERROR RADIUS. 
---
Predator and Blood hound are countered by upping your stealth skills. same with whispers, but less so, and anyway it counters the killer's main weakness, the terror radius, which it's still inferior to. 
---
save the best for last and unrelenting are designed to counter the killer's own cooldown, and only reduce it anyway. 
---
play with your food causes the killer to lose a token even if he makes an attack that misses; counter is obvious. and he only gets tokens to begin with by finding the obsession and letting them go, so the perk itself wastes his time. 
---
on top of that, Stbfl and PWYF were rleased with survivor perks that make the obsession stronger, which has increased a great deal with Mettle of Man. in fact, since most killer's obsession perks arent that good aside from Rancor, and are rarely used, the main survivor's obsession perks give power with little disadvantage.
---
Remember Me just got heavily nerfed. even now, it's only useful if three survivors are dead, the hatch has been closed, the obsession is dead, and the EGC timer is ticking, at which point the survivors have failed. the last person should be afraid. that's the game's theme. 
---
and finally, most of these "uncounterable" perks are rarely used at all. Fire up and monstrous shrine are countered by that easily, for example.
---
Ahh alright, I'll have to thank him/her next time I see them and also request golden character portraits cause that's the only thing missing although it is a big request :P
---
Yuuuup
---
OwO
---
My problem with throwing pallets early is I wait too late sometimes and get downed because of it. It's super frustrating because I should be safe at a pallet.
---
A C T I V A T E W I N D O W S
---
I do hate when there’s a teammate who sits at the edge of the map and waits for their team to die. They should get 0 rank progress and 0 BP. But there’s no way I could justify that.
---
There’s also a game based on DBD in Roblox called Until Daylight 🤔🤔🤔
---
No Mither fucks every instadown perk/ability/add-on in the game, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, Coulrophobia, Bloodhound and many more. No other perk can boast so many counters. Diversion is the only perk in the game where you can kill the killer by headshot, and Head On is the evolution of the locker Dwight. Isn't it obvious?
---
I don't care why he broke the rules. Don't make excuses for people.
---
Oh, just sassing because the amount of time it takes to self-care could get you half a gen or cleanse some totems.
---
Personally, I just hope other people run the clutch perks and use my perks for utility. Empathy, Botany Knowledge, Leader/Plunderer's, and Small Game.
---
Hmm why such an odd thing for NOED? Like yes punish the killer for wanting to end a match. This means if all the gens are powered but killer opens the gate their NOED gets turned off? 
---
Door spawns might be tricky to Code but idk.
---
The loud beeping is countered by survivors tapping the gates so no.
---
Survivors do know when hatch is closed, EGC gong sounds. If you mean after gates are powered and open...why are you looking for hatch?
---
For the love of god please make him vault faster again he vaults so slow
---
Plus all his perks are already in the blood web as neutral perks so we only miss out on the cosmetic
---
I kno its such a situational perk but you do open the doors faster your teammates see you opening the doors. You see where the exit gates are.
---
Then..dont drop them down so late. I dont know what to say.
---
Oh, sorry I haven’t played in a bit after the PTB. Is this a new wave of *Legion OP plz nerf?*
---
Imo she should simply have to recharge her blinks  (similar to clown anf adjustable with adfons) after she blinks 3-5 times or so.
---
Yeah man, i don’t know how anyone can seriously think new Legion is worse than he was before unless you played Mixtape tunelling Legion. IMO he’s easily an upper mid tier pick now.
---
Okay. Bonus cookie for you as I didn't know that.
---
Billy, LF, Huntress, Plague, Legion, Myers.
---
Claudette mains enjoy stealth watching other ppl die, say whatever you want about Nea being the killer, Claudettes mains are abominations that will leave you die just to get the hatch, even though there's still two other players alive
---
I’m depressed now
---
It’s pretty top tier for solo players, because healing yourself is a lot easier than hunting down teammates to heal you and wasting the same amount of time finding them and letting them heal you. I’d much rather waste the time doing it myself
---
It speaks volumes about how easy the Survivor experience has been for so long, that the very notion of using add-ons is somehow unreasonable to you.
---
Killers *have* to run good add-ons to stand a chance, even against empty-handed Survivors!
---
There is no just right time! If they respect pallets I'm not going to get a stun and if they dont respect then I always hit them.
---
Yes...
---
No counter to Discordance?
---
Isnt it better to start a gen later and be able to take 2 hits than get half a gen done and be one hit? 
---
I play alot of DBD on PS4 &amp; watch streamers but although i sit around rank 5 I think there is alot I can still learn about the game
---
Eh, I'd personally put him at B tier. He needs to actually get up to T3 to make use of this ability to counter MoM, and that takes some time.
---
Yes and now apparently every Survivior needs to dig into their supply of purple and red keys with milky glass
---
The Hex: Ruin is not the issue here dude!
---
True, that would mean we would get 2 killers and a new event within a few weeks, though - so im sceptical.
---
Please don't talk bad about my piggy...
---
I don't really need it. 
---
Plus it's not that hard to do well as killer, wanting to win before the gates are powered isn't really any dumber.
---
I fail to see what your teammates dying has to do with you personally seeing to the cleansing of all the totems on the map. Nice non-sequitur, but they're unrelated.
---
On top of the existing ones, a major issue you have is conflation.
---
I play Feng Min with purple hair but play stealthily. I am a bit of a freak honestly.
---
Idk, I feel my games are just way more engaging when I'm not in a corner touching myself for 90 seconds.
---
No, it was just to promote Death Garden.
---
Honestly sometimes the match enters a point of no return moment where the last person is only getting out by hatch. The problem is bad players cant tell the difference between a close call and a point of no return.
---
There is definitely a right time, I usually have no problem. Just watch videos of good survivor players to get the timing.
---
Well aren't you productive
---
If the shoe was on the other foot you'd be crying about it
---
Hatch standoffs weren't enjoyable for either side so don't come with that excusee
---
I agree. I feel like he is horrible to play against. It feels like his build forces tunneling like freddy, but he can spirint to catch up to you then cool down and walk with you then stab you. Feels inevitable.
---
But it could just be me and hang overs from old legion
---
I feel you on using it for solo healing. I find self care isn’t the biggest “waste of time” when your teammates are getting gens done. In red ranks, I can safely assume my teammates aren’t 4heads and can make use of their time. Most games where I don’t run any means to heal myself, I find my chases ending sooner even if I can loop them fairly well.
---
Oh no!
---
Or you could run a yellow toolbox to make gens go quicker, or any of the other myriad things you've got stored away!
---
As a solo I am starting to lean against self care. It just isn't good. A medkit would be better. Get another exhaustion perk, maybe dead hard as it has the most versitility.
---
Why not just put the nurse then, otherwise wouldn’t selfcare stand for Claudette
---
They might be better than before (though old CD Legion is a lot stronger I think), but they just feel a lot less fun now.
---
Exactly
---
TBH, the fame is in a better state than ever before. Sure we still get bugs and the balancing can be wonky, but I love the improved DbD.
---
I can understand that
---
There are a lot of them Until the Dawn, Dead by Roblox and probably more but Flee the Facility is the most popular one
---
Nice subtle jab. I'm not going to fight with you. It's annoying, and I punish those who teabag furiously. Simple.
---
Lmao ur really sitting here trying to Justify complaining about toolboxes now. 
---
Wait wait lemme guess... Decisive strike is still op?
---
Really off topic but your name looks familiar. I think I played against you at least once.
---
&gt;I don't want to go find the NOED
---
Was a valid argument before EGC.
---
Guess I'm just not a snowflake :/
---
Because teammates dying means you lose the game you fucking fool. How do you not see that? Jesus.
---
Also big words don’t make you sound smart, lay off google.
---
He gave himself every legacy. Even stuff he didn't earn. I don't know why everyone wants to make excuses for why he broke the rules. Rules are rules and I'd have never given him a third chance if I were BHVR. Especially after how he acted when he got banned.
---
Dammit I really need to learn SFM
---
I was just about to say the same. I've played against Potato as well.
---
At least on PC I’m running up against a lot of nurses ... And other killers that are using a nurses calling. So I don’t use it much unless a teammate has been hit and I can’t hear anything. It’s crazy the amount of killers using that perk. 
---
Adrenaline is top tier because I can loop and that almost always gets me back to full health and that boost of speed helps me get away while the gates are being opened.
---
r/redditsings
---
Lol, that’s the reason why I love playing as her.
---
Oh ok, I was wondering about why i only got the skillcheck bonuses for going from 0-100
---
I don't get this. How does rank reset change people's play style? Do people get points or money for being at a better rank?
---
The reason why he is F tier in basically every tier list is cause he is weak. He can”slow” that game down, but that won’t help him in chases as other will just do gens. My point is, he’s a noob stomper.
---
Fuck farming. I just want to play the video game
---
Get out of my swamp!!
---
At this stage, I’m glad MoM exists because some of these killers now are far too strong for casuals.
---
Top tier mom, adrenaline, deadhard, ds. 
---
Selfcare is ridiculous on how long it takes.  32 seconds to selfcare.. that's just ridiculous amount of time wasted.  Go do a gen
---
Hàng overs
---
Neither do you
---
Try verifying game files, might fix it. Its in properties on steam
---
She is the SWF killer. She is here to fight with all the try hard SWF teams.
---
You don't solve anything if you nerf her in the current state of the game. People would start to play just Billy or Spirit at red ranks. If you nerf even these 2 killers, then nobody would play killer at red ranks. 
---
Just nerfing Nurse without buffing mid and low tier killers to be Billy/Spirit level and without fixing some balance issues like gen speed and map designs.
---
Man I love that wholesome wraith smile 😀
---
Kinda like how swf is unfun for killers, but I bet that's not something you'd argue against.
---
when people spit in my face i just open my mouth and ask for more cause thats my fetish O\_o
---
Oh I know how much you can change in those files and I’m not saying giving himself legacy was a good or even fine thing to do but as far as I knew all he did was give legacy and I’ll be honest what he did doesn’t really bother me I just put on a video of his as background noise every once and a while.
---
Legion's mend add-ons stack anymore ? Some people said no, but idk. Someone tested them in KYF to see if they stack ?
---
Dunno why you're being downvoted, you're right.
---
Key words being pallet vaulting lol. That's not a minor thing. That is a huge thing.
---
Honestly nothing is more frustrating than seeing a teammate self caring in the corner (especially with sloppy butcher). If you do feel the need to heal yourself every time it’s probably better (and much faster) to bring a med kit. I think Plunderer’s is too underrated since it has a high chance for a Green/Purple Med kit, a good toolbox for productivity, and in the current endgame meta - a very likely chance to get a key. Would probably choose that over self care any build
---
Gonna suck if they lose interest
---
yes it is one sided. the killer is faster than the survivor, also the killer doesnt have to worry about being spotted by someone trying to kill them
---
the killer has always had the advantage in finding the hatch first so yes this is a gameplay element that is one sided in the killers favor
---
*So keep your eyes on me now...*
---
Love it BTW
---
I mean if the exit gates are powered by survivors completing gens then NOED activates
---
NOED shouldn't activate because killer initiated endgame by closing hatch
---
Door spawns shouldn't be that hard. Give the doors set spawns each map 
---
Door 1 spawns in one of 3 locations at one end. Door 2 spawns in one of 3 locations at other end.
---
Make loud beeping consistent with amount of progress on door or make it like tinkerer where killer gets a notification when door reaches that amount of progress
---
And I mean when killer slams hatch shut, give a noise notification on survivor's screen so they know where the hatch was and the direction the killer's coming from
---
I think left behind should activate when a survivor dc’s early in the round.
---
Agreed that's the only excuse anyone gives.
---
So keys work like this; hatch spawns closed when survivors + gens remaining = 4.
---
So if 0 gens remaining + 4 survivors = hatch spawn
---
1 gen remaining + 3 survivors = hatch spawn
---
2 gen remaining + 2 survivors = hatch spawn
---
So if 1 survivor is sacrificed. The key allows survivors to complete the game with 1 gen remaining. Or 2 gens if 2 survivors are sacrificed. My point is this is unfair advantage that allows survivors to shorten the game unfairly but you are disagreeing for some reason.
---
&gt; People DCING bc of mori’s is not a reason to remove them. 
---
That wasn’t my point.
---
&gt; They are not that annoying if you don’t get farmed or camped,
---
My point is being able to cut the game time in half unfairly.
---
&gt; I never cared to get mori bc i wanted to see the animation it’s good stream content, 
---
How is this relevant?
---
&gt; . If you can loop the killer, hide from the killer, at least for a little, you will pip atleast. As the game isn’t about escaping to win.
---
It’s about keeping the game fair and fun for both killers and survivors. Something you are against?
---
it's either rank reset or people not playing everyday. I am a good survivor(looping, running tiles, etc) but don't play as much as I used to because the game is pretty boring to me atm. if I decide to play 1 or 2 matches I'm getting matched with rank 12-15 because I'm rank 15 because of the monthly reset. I'm not intentionally bullying new players but they're just not good (yet), which makes it easy to loop them for more than 3 gens. it's the same for killer, I stomp teams within 3min and don't pip because I ended the game too fast. the matchmaking, ranking system and monthly reset are just dumb imo since they don't consider actual skill. your rank is determined by your time played.
---
Man i freaking love puppers. Sorry. That is all.
---
The way I see it is that while Nurse and Spirit technically don't counter MoM, they do have great mobility (that actually helps them during chase) to mitigate the whole getting MoM'd.  
---
Clown has sort of the same thing going, only in the opposite way, where he slows his victims down rather than speed himself up. And yes, a survivor who is speed-boosted from getting hit does lose some speed if they're hit with the Afterpiece Tonic.  
---
The Hag is, well, the Hag. Pray she's out of traps, and cry when she isn't, because she never is.
---
But only slightly, it’s only slightly faster than normal I believe
---
Yeah that's how it feels. I hit red ranks as survivor and know how to loop and be annoying with flashlights etc but I've had times where there's no pallets or windows nearby and I know he's gunna catch me anyway so I just stop. Like you said, it feels inevitable and that isn't fun. Among all the tryhard builds/top tier killers, at least there's some fun involved but not with Legion.
---
I'm glad that at least Behaviour isn't responsible for it.
---
I'm not a survivor main, I prefer killer. But I enjoy playing both. 
---
I don't agree with SWF. Personally I liked the original concept of 4 random people with no communication working together. I don't like that they allow SWF in regular matchmaking.
---
They dont counter it though, all four of them have to deal with metal of man
---
It happens to me all the time. And now if I run into killers who I’ve played against and made mad, they do it on purpose and then send messages afterwards (xbox). EGC was a good idea, but until the doors are separated it’s just going to enforce killers getting a free kill and/or slugging for bm.
---
Weird. Your corn looks way more dense.
---
Granted I also use FOV-Altering Perks and I have my resolution set to 1920x1080, but yeah your corn looks WAY more dense/grey than mine.
---
The overwhelming majority of players do not play SWF...
---
Still, unlike the Wraith, Doctor and Freddy, they have powers that mitigate the situation. You don't need hard counters to be able to deal with it effectively.
---
because every survivor is literally the same exact person
---
Probably the 1930s cosmetic collection
---
No. Legion was nerfed horribly. Still annoying though
---
If the doors were forced to spawn away from eachother, it would be less of a problem but as it is currently, it's hatch standoff 2.0
---
Right on! Thanks!
---
The "Nobody: " memes we're never funny.
---
Ok? Survivors failed the trial. I’m having a hard time being convinced that it should be more of an advantage to the loser than the winner.
---
Guess so
---
Puppers is so chill, it's the perfect content after a long dsy!  Plus his laugh and soundboard for all his antics is just hilarious xD
---
It depends on the player. I’ve pretty much given up on consoles. The load times are atrocious. But when I play on PC I use a controller and I’m still good at 360’ing a killer. It took some practice though.
---
indeed, it never worked out for me when i was using MoM and Adrenaline so i switched Adrenaline with Hope and it is so freakin' good
---
No, more like MoM, Adrenaline, DS und another exhaustion. Usually that is how it goes.
---
PS sorry if I misread your build.
---
Why do you think the survivors liked the standoff? It was boring for both sides.
---
&gt;or you die instantly as the hatch is closed
---
Maybe make it so that the entity kills you the moment the killer downs you so that you can't get slugged for 3 minutes?
---
This happens to me all the time :( The frames drop and it becomes hard to track, or even aim properly.
---
Yes..
---
&gt; Hiding in a locker will prevent the killer from seeing you once exit gates are powered.
---
Actually, it won't. Lockers only block auras, not noise notifications or Killer Instinct, and Rancor doesn't reveal auras like most detection perks. Instead, it pings each survivor's location with a loud noise notification similar to when a survivor screams. It was specifically designed this way because it's a Spirit perk and she can't see auras while phasing. 
---
There is nothing you can do to prevent Rancor from revealing your location short of being like right next to the killer, but on the upside, the killer has no way of knowing which notification belongs to which survivor and the notification doesn't reveal your movement beyond the spot you were when it was created (compared to aura-reading, which gives a lot more information). 
---
The counter to Rancor is really to play smart around it -- keep a low profile from when the gates are close to being powered, and don't make it obvious which bubble you are (such as by being the only one hiding away from the gens and gates).
---
There is nothing more satisfying as a freddy than having everyone in the dream state, and just jumping between them. A lot of people think freddy does not need tracking perks, but i think he makes better use of tracking perks, because he gets he keeps the momentum of finding a survivor for longer.
---
I hear yah, but you know how toxic this community can be sometimes. One side wants the other to feel powerless. But it shouldn’t be about making people mad or pissed for shits and giggles. Balance is something so desperately needed for this game. I love dbd, but sometimes this game makes my head spin.
---
Before I upgraded to an X I missed hatchets and backrevs for days. I quite literally couldn't see shit on certain maps. So happy I switched to an X, it's such a difference lol
---
Wait a minute... I see people asking for things like Shirtless Myers and Shirtless Kate, and many more shirtless people... But I have never seen someone make the suggestion for a shirtless Dwight...
---
“There can be only one white masked stalker/killer.”
---
For the locker perk I feel like it should only activate in a small range. Props to you for actually referring to a real pharaoh though but from my quick search I feel like he wouldn’t necessarily have a rage, more betrayal and wish to go back and to be a pharaoh again but I didn’t read too much I just feel like a lot of the killers generally aren’t ruthless killers in the sense that they kill because they like it.
---
The add-ons that increase the duration of his frenzy can be used to apply a great amount of map pressure. Forcing multiple survivors to mend and heal can be brutal.
---
However, you are correct. The majority of his add-ons are total crap now.
---
Get a PS4, #Sony4Life
---
Why do you think survivors liked the standoff? It was boring for both sides.
---
&gt;survivors were unfun for killers for over 2 years. Deal with it.
---
So instead of fixing the problem we just swing it to the other side? That's dumb.
---
When did bricky say this?
---
Maybe not open it up, but try using some compressed air to clean out the vents.
---
I tried it on an S, before the X dropped, and it was really bad compared to the Pro. Now it’s way better on the X across the board. But the load times are sooooo bad.
---
I mean. He is the asshole, but that’s the point... the whole team ignored him and almost let him die. It was stupid on they’re part to let him off, because you can bet your ass I’m letting them die. What a bunch of cunts. And for once In My life I’m going to be a cunt back. You also have to take into account the nea pulled her other teammate off the hook damn near immediently. So the feng couldn’t really do anything. And if she gets caught... it’s a done deal with probably less than 8K BP.
---
If they are bad players I’d probably apologize but for Christ’s sake the game makes you go through a tutorial. And the nea slow vaulted the window to evade the killer. I don’t buy it. Not at all.
---
&gt; unless you have an obsession with ~~a death wish~~ balls. 
---
FTFY :P
---
Ah, I didn't like the killers who have FOV perks so never unlocked them and don't know how fun they are.
---
My resolution should be at 1920x1080 though I can't check right now.
---
I'll just believe the devs like you more than me so gave you easy corn. :&lt;
---
He’s said it a few times on stream but I don’t have the clip. Try asking him on Twitter or the next time he streams.
---
Yes, but no. PS4 would still have a problem like this
---
Shhh shh it’s okay. Me too buddy. Me too. *cries in console*
---
get a tattoo of death garden meg mask with ponytails. Would look pretty cool.
---
I thought that given that he's a mummy, he should be decrepit and old. The movement speed boost is 30%, so in power mode he's at 137 which is between Legion and Pig dash which I thought was pretty balanced. 
---
On a related note, didn't consider what the range would have to be on that bandage throw- can't have naked mummies running around!
---
self care is a dead slot... is better to be healed by a teammate or find a medkit in bubba's basement. i used to have self care in every survivor i played and defend it to dead... but now for me is a shitty perk, i prefer having stronger perks
---
I just wonder why dbd is the only game that does this...
---
&gt;She is the SWF killer.
---
Just because SWF isn't balanced, doesn't make Nurse balanced.
---
&gt;you don't solve anything by nerfing nurse
---
You get a more fun game for survivors. Even if it's not "correct" to nerf nurse, to say it doesn't accomplish *anything* is simply wrong.
---
&gt;People would start to just play just Billy or Spirit at red ranks. 
---
I don't see why this is a problem? It's obvious nurse is more powerful than the other killers, so this is an obvious conclusion.
---
&gt;nobody would play killer at red ranks
---
It's my understanding that killers already derank to avoid red ranks. So this is already a problem that nurse existing doesn't magically fix. And again, good survivors/swf being unbalanced doesn't make nurses imbalance justified.
---
&gt;Just nerfing Nurse without buffing mid and low tier killers to be Billy/Spirit level and without fixing some balance issues like gen speed and map designs.
---
OP did not preclude these options. However they aren't as noticeably obnoxious issues as Nurse. I would hope nerfing Nurse would come  first.
---
Because he has added mobility with his power... did you not read it?
---
yep
---
People still play Teemo in LOL but that doesn't mean he's good or meta.
---
Upvoted because it’s true. But what would you ah e done if the killer found you after unhook and you died?
---
Works for me. Thanks &lt;3
---
I say we make it so the moment the killer downs the survivor post hatch being closed, the entity kills them then and there. No way to get slugged for 3 minutes.
---
Make the gates spawn further away.
---
Do something about camping hatch, idk maybe make it so it closes after a certain period of time if the killer camps it. Nobody likes waiting for no reason.
---
the point is gens have to be done and survivors have to be killed for keys to work..
---
i wonder if OP hasn't put their Xbox somewhere that has no airflow or in a place that already has a heat source nearby
---
Ps4 got the same problems lol. I got the game on pc but I'm not grinding all over again.
---
Plus the graphics are much better with every update.  I play on ultra settings on PC and the game does look good for what it is. The X is the closest to that. But the CPU sucks compared to my laptop and why the load times are so bad.
---
It only takes 5 seconds to load into a match on PC when someone doesn’t disconnect. It’s fast.
---
Comic book: Freddy vs Jason vs ash and Freddy vs Jason vs ash 2: the dream wairrior.
---
It does feel that way. I dont know if on PC it's different? I am on PS4
---
It would’ve been neat if y’all farmed or something. Since the game couldn’t have been fun with 2 Survivors...
---
Run which perk with Hope? MoM?
---
Just quit and never comeback, done that once, scary people outside
---
Difference being there that if they escape, the match ends. 
---
If the killer finds it first they can just camp it till the survivor shows up &amp; then slug them for up to 3 minutes, wasting everyone's time to see the animation.
---
It's not about who's winning or losing, it's about the pointless waiting.
---
You're the only one in this thread who agrees with me 😂
---
that dude should really be pissed at his teammates, they're the ones who left. i thought your line was funny.
---
I have the same argument with some of the people I play with. It’s all about personal preference.
---
It’d be like Reverse Monitor and Abuse. Tbh it could cause crazy mind games if you get enough tokens or if you have other stuff like Dark Devotion.
---
Killers gain advantage when they slam the hatch shut as they know where the survivor is going
---
Giving survivors the small detail of where the killer is coming from could help them choose which gate to go to
---
Killers like hag and trapper can already plan gate spawn
---
..true..true
---
The overwhelming majority of players aren't Pro Nurse players. Most of them are just casual Nurses, you can counter them by jumping in a locker when Nurse starts to blink, break line of sight, even mind game. Dead Hard and Mettle of Man can buy you some time against them, enough for your team to work on gens. Iron Will and even Spine Chill can help you to juke and stealth a Nurse. She has counters, you need just to learn them.
---
Say someone wasn't ever dragging the game out as survivor. Should they now get treated the same way just because someone else was toxic to you? 
---
Instead of perpetuating the circle, stop the toxicity.
---
WAZZZZAAAAAPPPPPPPP
---
oh what i wouldn't give, to be spat at in the face!
---
Played against a Joey earlier.  Was a boring match and at the endgame he ran at me while I was opening the gates, stabbed me, I finished opening the gate, got stabbed again, and escaped because his fatigue was too long, not because I played well.
---
D O. I T......... jus a lil bit
---
Careful stating you like Puppers on this reddit. People seem to think he's evil incarnate.
---
"You get a more fun game for survivors", but where is the fun for killers ? It's not fun to be gen rushed in 4 minutes, it's not fun to play Billy on Lery's or Huntress on Fractured Cowshed, it's not fun to play against Mettle of Man as a M1 killer. Yet, if I suggest a nerf for MoM, people tell me to kill myself.
---
Why they aren't obnoxious issues as Nurse ? The fact that everyone use Ruin in red ranks, even if it gets destroyed most of the time in the first 30 seconds, doesn't tell you that the gen speed is a big problem ? This game has 15 killers, but I see just 3 in red ranks ( Nurse, Billy, Spirit ), I wonder why so few people play with others killers. But no, just nerf The Nurse first, because just survivors fun matter.
---
50/50 chance.
---
David. Every time someone plays David I just think they're cute and innocent.
---
Makes sense. Sometimes you just gotta let loose after a bad day.
---
What does that have to do with what I said
---
It is fair but in conjuction with the others makes it useful
---
:D Best anology. Ty Sir, cookie for you.
---
bahah😂💀
---
Im beglian FYI.
---
So? lmfao if you're better. what now? want a cake or something? You are still a toxic hater. stfu.
---
I usually do, but I like to have self care because I use up most of my med kits pretty quickly since the one thing I’m really good at is losing line of sight with the killer.
---
Your honestly just bad. He has ONLY one attack that you can dodge, then he cant  hit you. His stun is 4 seconds long..and if you somehow still end up close to him then you desrve to be hit. 
---
He also cant Vault as fast..can still be stunned..hes an M1 killer.
---
me c:
---
In my opinion you don't need perks as a survivor
---
Oh look someone who felt the need to say something when they could've just ignored the post
---
Even if you are awake freddy will auto lock onto you when he swings and still do the blade cleaning animation as if he hit you.
---
He is supposed to completely ignore people who aren't asleep
---
sounds cheap and cheap things are usually cheap for a reason
---
Or the people that don't commit and crouch walk away when a gen is at 98% and then never come back while the killer chases you.
---
My experience was offer survivor cake the get hit by an iridescent hatchet, hooked, sandbagged saved, then moried. Ah DBD
---
Who said this month? My guess since we just had a big update we won't see another til atleast the next chapter
---
Hate it as survivor. It’s a free kill(s) for killer. As much as it sucked that one Claudette escape had a decent balance to the game allowing at least one escapee (skill dependent).
---
Are those canon?
---
I agree, especially since higher ranks are flooded with Billys and Nurses who can span the entire map in a few seconds *already*. There’s no chance of escape at that point.
---
Yes we know we heard this 50 times now....just make a god damn megatheard about it already. 
---
Seeing Survivor mains bitch about it 5 times is annyoing..Killers always had the problem of D/C for Hatch but we didnt keep bitching
---
You say that like survivors haven’t been teabagging in exit gates for years even without any animation or in-game incentive... people in this game like to try and piss off the other side.
---
The devs said last month, that it would be out this month.
---
Whwn did I even say survivors liked it? X'D
---
...is Billy licking his sledgehammer
---
I have the xbox one s so not really OG but that could be the reason
---
There is like 50 in the sub and they all say the same thing and it just gets kinda annyoing after awhile ok?
---
Thanks for the tips
---
“Pip by daylight”
---
The entire point is to escape or kill survivors. Rank means jack diddly shit. You get nothing for it, except longer wait times to find games.
---
Pipping means jack shit.
---
N-n-n-n-nurse’s? That’s a joke right?
---
Best comment I’ve read today 😂😂
---
Dude 4K is not a good design balance. The majority of the game are solo survivors. If every game ends with frustration of 3 potatoes for teammates either of two things will happen:-
---
We get pushed into playing SWF
---
We don’t bother playing survivor
---
It's clearly haddonfield a poor attempt to create hype
---
Exactly why I was thinking. Way too much going on
---
maybe you should spend less time on reddit and more time enjoying life
---
&gt; Bubba and Trapper S-tier
---
If we're going by "can technically not provide stacks in a world with only braindead survivors" then Pig should be S-tier too.
---
Yes I am rank 14-16 with Killer
---
Next patch will make exit gates like totems where you reset the bar when leaving it.
---
Do you have proof of this because i havent seen that anywhere. 
---
We got Legion this month its not likely goin to be Freddy this month
---
I mean. If the legion doesn’t camp or tunnel and runs bbq. It can be BP bounties for everyone
---
Yes he was, he doesnt even have a power anymore
---
Remember last month that big announcement were they told us their plans?
---
Me then lol
---
Oh okay
---
I can feel sorry for obsessions that one of the perks they re going up against is rancor
---
It seems better to me to end it fast and move on to an other game.
---
They slaughtered his power. Honestly they should remove him from the game until they make him a new one
---
Left Behind: 75% speed for each remaining generator. Completing a generator during end-game reopens the hatch and extends the timer by 2 minutes.
---
I think so. But then it could become a cess pool with so many conversations it's impossible to keep up with, it would end up delving into other topics. Tbh I wish Reddit would give pages for flairs Instead of just the tags. Like a whole page for the discussion flair, or for salt. Then a main page where it all shows up like it does now
---
Ganking I can handle(Gotta love Sakura with Revenge (:&lt;  ) But it's there. You should add me if you'd like to play sometime, I have a mate I drag along in FH and DBD all the time!
---
Not everyone wants to go against people using mouse and keyboard. Don’t be selfish.
---
The limitations on it obviously balanced it but I dont know if its viable now
---
But he is not
---
He just plays differently
---
You've been posting here for a month, your first clueless post on the time limit was 10 days ago.
---
Literally a waste of time this isn't a job or school
---
I'll make sure I get saves where applicable, I detest farming but it means I can take the agro if I am fully healed no?
---
It doesn't make a lot of sense from a gameplay perspective; but I guess that "bleedout" is a different health state from "injured", hence it doesn't work.
---
Monitor counter: spine chill
---
Make it so he can see tracks when in frenzy. They nerfed his speed in it so it shouldn't be that big of an issue.
---
His power is mainly used to vault windows and pallets but outside of that you're usually better just m1ing
---
i bet you have as many friends as pinky rings
---
Can he not see the tracks any more? Just the sent of other survivors?
---
i want to play this
---
Fantastic lighting, friend.
---
Holy shit you are a character aren’t you? 
---
NOED still sucks, and you are still wrong. Maybe if you pulled your mouth off of your own shlong you could maybe make a proper case without having to sound like a pretentious douche who acts like an intellectual when in reality all your are is your typical run of the mill Redditor. 
---
Btw, my case was that I wanted a fucking totem counter, yours was “muh horror game immersion”.
---
You are definitely right, this conversation is over.
---
I was tempted to do that and just pump points into always having a med kit. I have like 50+ yellow ones on David so I can do it for days

---
When you literally have wait 7 seconds to be able to play the game without needing add ons then yes you are a weak killer. 
---
Dont get me wrong I'm a former freddy/pig main but even I know freddy sucks big time. The only reason freddy gets kills is because survivors are either to dumb to miss a skill check or are to cocky to care about winning
---
I thought that was the consensus on freddy? Because his current build is to sleep multiple people but if youvd only got 1 person slept then you tunnel them down as they are the only one you can hit no?
---
I said in the post that I suck with nurse and that's why I want to use a mouse and keyboard because she is just useless on console. Using mouse and keyboard with nurse is still difficult but makes it actually possible to get a 4k. Also selfish? Seriously?
---
That's where you're wrong kiddo. Killers are hella toxic, survivors are hella toxic, very rarely do you find a non toxic match. 
---
But when you do find one... it's very refreshing.
---
Butt dancing!
---
Done the same, then after the second flashlight blind and they don’t wanna farm, I go tier 3 and end the flashlight blinding. Don’t mind farming every now and then depending what was burned and to have a relaxing match. Can’t be blood thirsty all the time!
---
He could never see scratch marks in frenzy
---
Bouncing from survivor to survivor doesn't get kills, its good for points but if you actually want to win a match you'll have a bad time
---
The thing is, Spine Chill still stays useful even after a player is experienced. 
---
Sure, the situational awareness of an experienced survivor is higher than that of a newbie, but being able to detect when the killer is actively set and coming in your direction from 36m is still useful even if you’re not afraid to get chased.
---
"i bet you have as many friends as pinky rings" but yet some1 can post like this multiple times makes sense like I said had this problem only here n before even being down voted I actually had up voted before survivor mains got butt hurt
---
I played against a Dwight and he DC'd because he couldn't lose me in the cornfield.
---
Well you so not wait at all id you use range addons.
---
And you get wallhacks and amazing stall.
---
I play Freddy 90% of my games and I Love his hit and run playstyle.
---
yes indeed
---
So that's why I've been getting so damn low points as a survivor
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee
---
Dwight would like to know your location.
---
I would have 3 exit gates appear on the level. Once the five generators are completed 2 gates in close proximity to each other will become powered leaving the 3rd gate locked closed. When you are the last survivor remaining and the hatch is closed all 3 gates will become powered giving the survivor time  to open one as the killer will now have 3 objectives instead of two. 
---
Fun fact all of this would be invalidated by using whispers to find the cheeky survivor.
---
Yes, if you are desperate and the game is coming to a close.There is no reason you can’t go find someone else for more pressure. Normally you’d want to keep sleeping people for that first hit and go find someone else to keep constant pressure on the survivors.
---
Pretty sure nurses blink hit doesn't cause it to stack, so she should be higher. Unless they changed it that is.
---
I would not like that at all and I play killer more.
---
Not before she disconnects, leaving your trail the only thing the Trapper can see.
---
&lt;3
---
He’s 2nd, Bubba is #1 since he can insta down your hole team in a second!
---
And absolutely on console wants a Nurse with PC capability. If you want a 4K, use spirit, billy, or just git gud at controls. Nurse is good because she takes practice, and if console survivors have to deal with a handicapped control interface, why is it fair that you get to play with one that PC players use?
---
What about the other half?
---
I love whispers lol.
---
Where my cat bubba?
---
Trapper should definitely be below legion and Plague, he doesn't even control if the survivor gets trapped or not. and hatchets are much easier to doge than Frenzy/purge.
---
Got my upvote
---
😬
---
It's basically the entity telling you where to find the P3 Claduettes.
---
From my viewpoiny 1/10 people toxic 1/2 neutral and 2/5 are nice people.
---
It can be that I am lucky ingame since this subreddit seems really toxic compared to most of my games
---
What about them?
---
What if I'm trying to get adept nurse trophy hm? And also, if I want to use a keyboard and mouse on console it's not your problem, why should you care?
---
Yep - you can. I tend to run borrowed time for unhooks instead. That way both of us can take a hit if I am healed. Self care allows you to take the hit if you unhooked outside the terror radius, or if you're picking up a slugged survivor.
---
Yeah you didnt know survivor mains use morse code by crouching over and over to say goodbye
---
I take hits as success, actually. I did well enough to piss ‘em off. I t-bag to show dominance, because I usually get tunneled to shit and run the killer around the most.
---
Just because its in the game doesn't mean that it isnt awful to play against
---
Thanks for the mental image, it will haunt me forever.
---
tbf I've seen the timer skip a few times, so maybe they still thought they had some time left?
---
But it's not pink. Still looks awesome though
---
Swf is unfun for solo survivors lol. I can not tell you how many times I was with a 2 man or 3 man swf  (me being the solo) and them either dcing or farming off me or just letting me die. No one likes bad swf but the people in those groups, that's not a solely killer complaint.
---
He isnt though. Your just really bad at playing Legion. Legion is DEFTINKY not the worst killer, Trapper and LF are far worse. His power gives him a free first hit, wastes time, and lets them track and see where survivors are, along with ignoing pallets and windows when its used right.
---
Wow. That survivor who told you to go kys must think he’s the edge lord of all the edge lords.
---
Best thing I've seen all day lol!
---
Be the change you want to see in the world! :D
---
Damn. Too bad your country got trampled over in ww2 and just let Hitler walk all over you
---

Most killers I go against are more salty and rude than any of the survivors I've gone against when I play killer. But no my friends and I definitely see the difference too. Since there's more than a handful of us who see it, we can't all be crazy.
---
Trapper is mid tier because trapper can straight up control the game if he places his stuff right 
---
Legion is in his own shit tier
---
Just play how you want to play and use whatever perks you want. It's totally fair to use NOED. Just how it's fair for survivors to use whatever they want. Dont let the community bias and "imaginary rules" dictate how you play. Just have fun doing it.
---
When the take is right but they downvote anyway
---
If also waste time for legion
---
It's a good build though....
---
I've been a killer main since mid 2017
---
Good for you?
---
Exactly... reddit has a bunch of asshole killermains.
---
Head on rarely works when you need it.
---
Not much. It takes more time to mend then the stun is
---
Trapper is the worst killer in the game because his power wastes more time then it gives him, and survivors are hardly effected. 
---
You havent acaullty given me any proof as to WHY Legion is shit so your talking out of your ass it seems.
---
Yasss I never used ds before the nerf but it comes in handy all the time now.. so many killers tunnel. It's a life saver.
---
Oooo he might be me
---
But I'd rather you do a gen for 32 seconds.... learning to play without selfcare is awesome.
---
Try urban evasion jeff haha. I ended up scaring half the team thinking I was the killer.
---
Tbf it was probably pretty hard for them to find the totem on the game map. I bet the moris felt satisfying though. And lucky you! My totems never last that long lol
---
I'm really paranoid after using Infectious Fright for a bit because I never knew how many survivors were usually nearby. 
---
I think it's actually pretty good because it will usually make survivors run away or hide for a bit, wasting their time.
---
Also, the menu screen (where you press A to enter) has uncapped framerate, and if you sit there for too long the console will run hot. My PS4 sounds like it’s a helicopter.
---
Well, they did change it, but only to buff its pre-existing effects, so it's still pretty useless.  
---
I think that if you're the last survivor alive, you should be able to open Exit Gates 50% faster, and earn 50/75/100% more BP in the Survival category.
---
Maybe you're just shit with trapper
---
I literally went out of my way to remember my reddit login, which I have never used, to be able to comment here. I'm Hex: I'm gay and my boyfriend is Hex: I'm trans. We had lots of fun playing with you guys! It's a blast seeing ourselves on here lmao
---
I agree. Was playing on pig few days ago, gates were so close I could see both of the opening levers just standing in the middle. Also, there were no obstacles in my path so it was a gg for the last survivor.
---
if disliking a mechanic makes me a baby then wah wah motherfucker  
---
i really hate Survivors who rave about how good they are but treat their precious flashlights like a fifth fucking limb; Franklin's Demise laughs at your flashlights especially when you dumb fucks are teabagging at the exit gate
---
To the wall?
---
I hate this fucking argument. How is 1 survivor escaping NOT balanced? Are you fucking broken? All I’m hearing from killer mains is “hur dur give me 4K games for balance”.
---
Take decisive strike.
---
Do luck offerings work with Ace in the Hole? Like, do I get increased in luck in getting 2 add ins or better add ons?
---
Yes

Alestorm's *Drink* has something to say about that
---
"They say all the best things in life are free
---
so give all your beer and your rum to me!"
---
That's shit got nerfed to the ground man
---
I think Billy is pretty good. Saying that I can still escape him and I have had others escape me. The thing with hillbilly is if he is a good one you actually have to use a concrete strategy vs just winging it and doing whatever against low tier killers. You cant mess around with hillbilly.
---
When you dc before they escape
---
Yes, it was very satisfying considering we were all randoms and decided in the heat of the moment to give our gratitude to Myers :)
---
I agree DS isn’t broken 
---
Adrenaline is more of a 50/50 rather than only a 10% chance to be useful and the exhaustion is only 40 seconds at level 3.
---
Self care is a crutch perk, it makes medkits useless is generally a very useful perk. 
---
Quick and quiet is strong against new players as they aren’t usually good at following scratch marks.
---
That got patched a bit ago.
---
Noed isn’t worth it unless you have a low tier killer. You might get one or two kills off it
---
&gt; And no, bc it is both fun and not fun at times because how can you really please everyone, mori’s are fun to killers,
---
Never asked for this game to be perfect for everyone, only suggesting ways to improve it.
---
&gt; flashlights are fun to some survivors maybe not to killers, it’s just there, even though flashlights save people, 
---
Flashlights have counters
---
&gt; mori’s at the beginning most likely is the other survivors fault for farming.
---
You keep missing the point.
---
With a mori, a survivor is dead after being downed by twice as opposed to three times.
---
With a key, survivors can escape without completing all gens/opening gates.
---
These are cheap tactics and serve no purpose in being in the game. Why not have an add-on where two survivors start hooked or 2 gens are already completed? The game as it is is already fairly balanced but keys/moris greatly disturb that balance. If you disagree and think it’s better for killers/survivors have very unfair advantages with no counters, then there is nothing more to discuss.
---
i call dips on the backwash!
---
That’s what they used to be like
---
Remember me got absolutely destroyed
---
It's really a pain in the ass to deal with as a killer. Unless they read you and tunnel you out of the game, which is hard to do with DS, you're going to pip or safety.
---
yeah i use it all the time now, before it was "hey yeah i cant play this game so i have d-strike" but now its "THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR TUNNELING DIPSHIT", I love the new message it sends
---
Thank god
---
Not if you're being tunneled.
---
It goes right there, see? I drew it with a magic marker.
---
Well he’s better now so..
---
it is 100% legit but 50/50 liked  
---
as a Killer main i can't even count the number of times i got blinded after breaking a pallet or picking up a Survivor cuz some asshat with a flashlight and an extra duracell wanted to be the hero  
---
honestly i dont care enough to demand a change (its legit and it's my job as the Killer to find a way around it) but it seems to be merging into every match and it's annoying
---
You'll get to use it once then and he just resorts to tunneling you again.
---
Audio is having some trouble again.
---
It gets heavily affected by the line of sight. Read: if there is one tiny piece of grass between you and the source of the noise, you won't be hearing anything.
---
It's most noticable when you are on the game and there is someone working on a generator below/above you. The sound will noticable, just heavily muffled :c
---
Hillbilly question. When is bloodlust reset? After chainsaw active rev (on m2 click) or after it's been 'used' and you're actually charging.

---
You do realise the nerf was them making it an anti tunnelling perk right?
---
WHY WHITE cmonBruh
---
Yeah but at least if they notice you have the speed limiter (I think that's the name?) add-on they immediately know that you are farming
---
Surveillance is my favourite perk.
---
It definitely sucks and makes the game really unfun to play. But hey, people are going to die, whether you like it or not. Try to extend chase as long as you can to buy your teammates time. Ideally, this way the killer can maximally get 1 kill, leaving 3 survivors to escape.. in which case the killer usually depips depending on how hard he tunneled you. 
---
It sucks but it's the way it is right now. I honestly feel like tunneling/camping should be punished more and going for others/leaving the hook should be rewarded more.
---
Yes I do, but dont you realize that you get it once and then they just tunnel you again right after you use it? I got it a teir 3 and I use most of the time and it never gets them off me and or saves me from ending up dying from tunnel
---
Laughs in pig
---
Tbh I like this interpretation of what I tried to say way more than what I actually said.
---
Is the Plauge worth a purchase?  Her perks seems very situational and lackluster.  Is she commonly used online?  Top/mid/low tier killer?
---
Some say he can be bought with shards cause he is not ghostface. They got only the rights for the mask from Funworld, not the character from the Scream people.
---
It should, you should just progressively lose blood points if you camp or tunnel
---
very wholesome, good post, not a trash meme like everything else in this subreddit.
---
&gt;I think that toxicity is too common at least on Xbox and it ruins my experience with the game
---
It really is, man. I bought the game because a few of my friends were talking about how amazing it was. The first match I played as killer, I killed 2, and the 2 that escaped sent me like 10 messages about "how horrible I am" and how I should "kill myself." I laughed hysterically, because, who talks like this in real life?
---
I tried a few other times, and same result. Regardless if I was killer or survivor, my inbox would get flooded with toxicity. Like, I know I suck. I'm brand new at this game, what do you expect?
---
Sadly, I've given up playing it. Back to F13 for me. It's an amazing game, and I love the lore and all the characters, but all the toxicity isn't worth it. Like, maybe give some tips instead of being an asshat. Oh well. I don't like playing with my friends who got me in to the game because they are all rank 1's, and I feel like playing with me isn't as fun as if they were in a lobby with like ranks, ya know?
---
No one:
---
Survivors after every rank reset: 
---
*pictures of them being camped*
---
Your telling me it takes skill to hold one button while occasionally having to press a second?
---
It gives you time to loop them so your team can do gens.
---
What the heeeeeeck, really?? So much has changed with this update. I can’t keep up.
---
Or reasons I wont believe anybody who says this community has few problems. Statements like that just get free passes with no punishment even though honestly if you told somebody to kill themselves you are a trash human being.
---
Yeah but the whole thing is that there is no counter. They should punish killers for tunnel and face camp
---
Yeah but out of the female models Jane is the biggest because of how dummy thick she is.
---
I still main her tho
---
Shes mid to low it looks like. She needs someone who has studied all their life to be a good killer. J still havent 100% figured her out. For example, the cleansing pools that give you corrupt purge after survivors cleanse their illness tend to reset at some point during gameplay so while you think you're stocking up for the endgame, all of a sudden last gen goes off and you hear a sound and all your corrupt purge pools vanish.
---
The extra speed burst and not needing to rev the chainsaw. Makes sense. Not sure what the question is.
---
Thanks for the laugh mate, needed it!  
---
Also a well deserved silver.
---
Risky click of the day
---
She ain’t big upper body wise, just lower body
---
My kind of perk
---
The hatch is balanced now. You can get it. I can get it. Anyone can get it. The way it was before was just stupid, “hur dur I need a welfare escape every trial” That’s you.
---
I'll try it next game. Thanks!
---
What do you mean I am in a chase?! There is no one here!
---
I'll try it soon! Thanks for the advise
---
That Lightweight got me not gonna lie
---
we played a match together today (i was Feng in Wreckers' Yard) against a Wraith and he bought a mori just because of your name lmao
---
Meg got those "fuck me" eyes for Trapper.
---
Farming is a fun deviation from being tunneled. Plus it’s absolutely a godsend for 2x bloodpoint weekend
---
That kys is just the cherry on the cake for this post
---
According to the devs, yes. However, i never notice a real difference.
---
Exactly, and with nurse, you can instantly be right on top of them applying more pressure instantly. And if you're playing against a team that uses flashlights, you'll never have to worry about them again. Pair it with BBQ, and you know where all survivors not in lockers are
---
*All my friends are killer mains you know*
---
*Wait for them to hook you then patrol*
---
*Please don't make them run too many loops*
---
*You don't know the pallets you abuse*
---
Maybe make it so that it slowly regresses like a generator instead? That’s kinda harsh
---
One Claudette I played with was hooked, i saved her at the cost of being hooked myself, she went all the way to the other side of the map behind the shack, killer hooked another survivor and the last unhooked survivor tried to save him, mind you this was happening on the mine shack, so Claudette had all the time while I was hooked to come save me, but she didn't.
---
Killer hooked the last survivor and Claudette was just quacking around the shack, I died, the others died too, BUT before Claudette could find the hatch the killer did it first, they closed it and then went to look for Claudette.
---
Claudette was so boosted, she crouch walked from the shack to the exit gate that was behind where I was, and tried to open it, thankfully killer came just in time and knocked down this boosted ass survivor.
---
Few times have i cheered a killer the way I did that time.
---
People act like NOED isn’t preventable lmao. Cleanse 5 totems, it’s not that hard. Every game I play I make sure I scout the area, cleanse a totem, then finish a gen and look for more. I’m being productive whilst scouting the map. Now I know mostly every totem spawn in every game and I 9/10 times prevent NOED. Small game helps. They can use it if they want, but there’s no reason that you couldn’t prevent it.
---
Nah.
---
Tenacity
---
lmao imagine being such a baby about a video game
---
lmao your reaction at the end when you heard the sound
---
I might run that instead then. Thanks for the advice
---
Try it out and see if it's something that you'd have fun with, my comment is just a general advice &lt;:
---
Best feeling in the world tbh
---
Wreck-It Ralph..?
---
Luck only works with getting yourself off the hook and getting yourself out of a Trapper Bear Trap only. If you want better loot out of chests all you need is Plunderers and Ace in The Hole. Maybe Pharmacy for that sweet first Green Medkit but nothing else helps.
---
It just needs fixing, I still think it needs buffing on top but for now thats the main issue with it
---
Sure, as soon as they remove MoM, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Dead Hard and Instant Heals.
---
Yes, I know you. We played many matches together :)   
---
Also, I'm sorry for my teammates when the killers brings a Mori because of me.
---
Thanks kind ~~stranger~~ friend
---
Geez credit the creator at least
---
NOED has a decent counter. Just do the totems every match, this helps the genrushing mathes.
---
The survivor meta more less necessitates tunneling.
---
MoM, DS/BT, DH/BL/SB, Adrenaline. Good luck getting through all that before the game is over. God help you if more than one survivor is running the same loadout.
---
Not running NOED? Pffft, later dude, see you at the exit gate.
---
It’s right there see, the entity drew it there with the magic marker
---
Watching them going into every wrong directions possible until they die.
---
That was literally my point.
---
A black square?
---
Jesus christ survivors are snowflakes to the extreme.
---
I heard that as 'Adam!'
---
Wait wait why does this have dislikes?
---
Awesome thanks! I'm running an item gathering build during reset and was wondering if it was better to bring a coin or luck. This helps!
---
Really depends on the survivors you're facing against. 
---
In many games as the hillbilly I've managed to quickly secure multiple hooks in a short time spawn. In a few occasions I faced a team of survivors which never allowed an opportunity for a clear chainsaw swipe which pretty much rendered me an M1 killer with high mobility. 
---
It's hard to balance hillbilly. If it was up to me I would increase his charging time a little bit and maybe give the chainsaw a cool down such as this: after a successful 10 second sprint and longer, the chainsaw is overheated and require an X amount of time before it's ready to use again. 
---
What would this change do? Prevent hillbilly from one shooting survivors who were caught off guard due to the mobility of the killer in comparison to survivors reaction time. 
---
You're welcome to argue the point I made, I'm just brainstorming some ideas if he's in a minor need of power adjustments.
---
Yeah I'll use that for now but if /u/Kingslay87 updates the portraits to their gold style are you gonna combine it with the background in this pack as well?
---
Yeah because racing across a map in 3 seconds and having instadowns is so balanced... 
---
He has not 1 cool down... I'm so confused to how you would ever see him balanced.. 
---
If I as a survivor suffer from exhaustion so should Billy.
---
It was such an unnecessary nerf too; just have the perk not trigger/deactivate if the Hatch is closed and it wouldn't provide the Killer an advantage during the EGC but it would still be worth running in an end game build.
---
What's funny is that really MoM is the best perk right. DS is shit, DH wont save you from the killer at all. SB will save you for a while unless killer is tunneling and borrowed time is actually trash. Killer perks are just infinitely better than ever survivor perk eith the exception of MoM. Killer is just a braindead roll
---
This dude puts a spoiler on his post of a leaked killer so people who dont know can be surprised and some people can't even tag their endgame spoilers. Thank you. Ez upvote
---
That’s not a new account
---
Small game
---
Not every killer has to be top tier, some of them are fine being mid tier like Myers or Plague when it comes to strength. Not every new killer has to match Billy/Nurse/Spirit/Hag/Huntress in power.
---
Billy along with Huntress is a killer that has  highest skill expression level in the game, and in that department they both should be something to strive for when making new killers.
---
I’d say bring a Coin if you’re sure you can survive, otherwise bring a White award and just play really greedy. Sprint to the basement, loot and pray the killer doesn’t have Franklin’s.
---
Alright, but make sure we get rid of franklins, bbq, moris, instadowns, and ruin.
---
Obviously, either way it would be beating up on a noob
---
Imagine killers asking to remove deadhard because they don't want to wait with their swings.
---
you can counter noed. just do it and stop complaining
---
Ahhh, it's good to see you here! My friend and I may have died, but we were cheering you on while you were trying to get the trap off of your head. Fun game!  &lt;3
---
lol, believe me, every time i saw you in the lobby i get all sweaty 'cause i know some of them are going for the memes, anyway, you're a lovely Kate 💓
---
You should replace thanatophobia with sloppy butcher if you don’t have something better, or, *coughs violently* noed.
---
sure thing. he's much better at making stuff golden. I can't make a better version than that on my own
---
*"...now what?"*
---
Both the key and the flashlight were looted with my plunderers instinct that very game everything lined up perfectly
---
Yeah, it’s funny that I can run Killing Floor 2 with Nvidia Physics and Ultra, but DBD will begin to stutter at 60fps on Ultra.
---
I’ll get a photo next time I’m on
---
Dead hard bearly works 50% of the time. And is so easy to counter compared to Noed. Stop being a killer main and see stuff from survivors point of view. And ur just skipping the fact that i am giving a good change for it? Noone wants killer mains opinion on shit.
---
I wanna let you know I've never really considered downloading custom icons... till I saw yours. I love them so much.
---
You might not want to let too many of the hook slaps go to your head. Many headphones using killers will smack someone immediately after hooking to interrupt the ear piercing shriek and substitute it for the typically less painful shouts from an M1, especially if you're one of the female characters.
---
Generators are random so it’s probably a piece that is set on the board
---
Bubba's chainsaw is awful, you'll only get a hit with it if the survivor is in the open with no windows/pallets. You will be forced to m1 most of the time. I think Plague should replace him in this tierlist.
---
You can guarantee that the survivor will only get hit 3 times thanks to your power.
---
Noticed that.
---
How would lockers work tho
---
The maps can be kinda bad and there's some infinites with balanced landing but it's still not as notable compared to Nurse.
---
Marth's group is hardly comparable to your average group of survivors. I think that experiment speaks more to the power of a SWF than the power of Nurse. Not to mention they used uniform meta perk setups, with Pre-Nerf DS a lot. And the games they didn't have perks they had comms. [If you look at the first two charts here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests) you'll see there aren't that many 4 mans either. 
---
It doesn't matter how many people are playing Nurse. It's irrelevant to her power level, she's obnoxious and needs a nerf. Bad nurses pad the stats to make good nurses less obvious.
---
Did u not read thw f-ing post. Bad survivors doesnt go for the dull totems. And even if the team misses one its fkn over for atlest 1 guy. Noed skips half of the fkn game just like moris
---
Freddy was soon to learn, that this basement had to 2 unavoidable pallets
---
Tango down
---
Wait really?!? Plz no
---
I spent around 85% of my playtime as survivor
---
Remove yourself instead.
---
I fell over in my chair in class laughing
---
Yea I personally think the perk deserves a buff but even if not it should at least work, I don't see anyone complaining about the perk not working so I'm not sure if they are even aware how broken it is, but hopefully this post can get some attention and alert the devs
---
So why didnt you just stalk the first guy instead of smacking him down???  Then haunted ground kicks in and 3 people are down.. the said f this try again on a new match.
---
Subtle.  I like it.
---
MoM and Adrenaline at least. DS sucks and DH isn't even that bad.
---
Instant heals are just unnecessary.
---
Dumb thank you but next..
---
Thank you, you're very kind to say that :) When I'm in the lobby, I just hope they don't bring Ebony Mori, I don't mind if I'm the one getting mori-ed, but I do feel bad for the other survivors.
---
I see NOED and MoM as equal perks. Neither side likes the other, they both can drastically change how the game ends, but both can be made essentially useless if the other team goes out of their way to prevent it from being used in the end game. So if you get rid of one, get rid of the other in my opinion
---
Nah at least legion can run a little faster than usual Freddy just can’t do nothing
---
Or like Keys. Or maps that show the killer location. 
---
Also, Bad survivors. 
---
I would be Ok as a compromise to make a totem counter. That way you don’t have to be in a SWF to know when they are all done.
---
*losing *lose
---
It counteracts playing against toxic swf groups and if survivors can’t do 5 totems in a game then that’s their problem.
---
Let's see how can you find totems...maps...small game..literal knowledge of the map
---
May I use this in a video edit?
---
Missed opportunity to use one of Zombie Hugger's templates. ;w;
---
Kinda late to the party but does this still apply or does the perk effect vaulting speed again? Since it says it does in the description of the perk.
---
I'm already glad that it has a counter. As a solo survivor it's nigh inpossible to counter it though, since most team mates are potatoes, but the counter exists.
---
Take a few minutes out of those 2400 hours into learning how to spell "lose" and "losing".
---
Easiest way for me to rank up solo survivor is to have a very altruistic build and be decent on chases. I run we'll make it, bt, sc, and dh.
---
imo legion should be S tier. My mettle of man is never useful against him as he can never catch me unless he uses frenzy at least once during the chase which means you have the deep wound status affect until you can mend. Mettle of man DOES NOT work if you have the deep wound status applied even if you are downed with his basic attack. I am not sure if you still get a stack towards MoM but I know for a fact that if you have it ready, it will not work if you have the deep wound affect which I think is BS because i got downed by his basic attack and not frenzy.
---
True be like
---
I mean do you really care what random people in game think? Like when people call me out for wallhacking as scratched mirror mike, speed hacking, “tunneling” or my trapper legacy weapon (that I don’t use cause I like the store cosmetics more) I just laugh it off and if they keep going I just sit back and try to hold back tears as I become short of breath from laughing.
---
50% of the time. That means instead of 6 “hits” it takes 6 hits and 3 misses. That is 1.5 extra lives. I would take that. Better than MoM that only saves one hit.
---
He referenced it 2 times! When Andy got hooked at around 11:53 and another time at around 17:00. I was so happy that he referenced this game!
---
You know cleansing all of the totems prevents NOED from activating?
---
I usually don’t like the Neko drawings, but this was very well drawn! I love it!
---
Thats just bad optimization. Which they intend to make huge strides towards fixing that here soon.
---
So just a bush ?

This just made me realize that all of Adam's perks are perfect for trolling your teammates; Diversion can be used to rat out stealthy teammates and Deliverance can be used to deny a wannabe unhooker altruism points.
---

---
Sure, just credit my instagram @jayden_mcleod_art :)
---
Thanks a lot! It was actually pretty fun
---
Not what I'm saying at all and you damn well know that.
---
 It's on you if you stay to try and save survivors for that long, blood warden is a fair perk and decently balanced even if it can only be triggered on the off-chance you hook someone after gens are done.
---
 If the survivors stay when there's a whole minute on the time, including how much it slows down when someone is down? That's great, and no one is to blame but the survivors. Don't be too altruistic, that's how these things happen
---
Ikr, I find him much more fun now.
---
Hooks also continue to make an Entity squishy sound when somebody has been hooked on it.
---
MoM has no real counter other than a Mori. As of now, the downside to MoM is not sufficient. 
---
NOED can be countered, but hard for a non-SWF to verify all tokens are done. A fair balance for NOED would be a token counter. Then there is a little notification for you to get the tokens done or otherwise you are risking it.
---
Hey, the game is giving me Error Code 8012 and saying that it can't connect to online services? Can anyone help a guy out?
---
You might want to put a seizure warning.

---
DS just needs another rework. 60 second timer sucks, you can still get striked even when you don't tunnel.
---
Nah mate, you're just being antagonistic. There's tons of survivors here.
---
Did u know that looking for all the dull totems can cost u like 3 minutes or more?
---
Edit: now imagine in solo
---
My favorite survivor is sweet. He's just so cute
---
What was funny is that I was playing it as background noise while playing DBD and was like “Waaaaiiiitt a minute.”
---
Happens on PC during the loading. Is it during the game itself?
---
Yea loosing so much time not doing the primary lbjetive and giving the killer more pressure
---
Dodging hits isnt the reason DH is good, its an amazing perk bc it can be used to reach a pallet/window when otherwise you wouldve been hit, extending the chase for much longer. I don't want it removed/nerfed, but it is pretty damn good
---
Proof?
---
Thanks you! I appreciate it.
---
Ur still missing the fact of how easy it is to counter Deadhard. And mom doesnt work against every killer. I come out with a suggestion for a perk that is not balanced. Not to talk about every fkn survivor perk that makes u miss one m1.
---
Have the same issue, the servers are probably off now
---
That never happens when spawning in. The realm would be 'Woodsboro' and the map name would be where 'Sydney's House' is written. For example, it doesn't matter where you spawn on the Haddonfield map, it'll always say 'Lampkin Lane.' Licensed maps always say the same, but the older maps use that upper title to differentiate between the different maps in a realm (for example Groaning Storehouse, Coal Tower, Shelter Woods and Suffocation Pit are different maps in the Macmillan Estate realm.)
---
I'm gonna!
---
Yes. I’m like 5-10 minutes into the match and then it DCs and i get the “a player disconnected from the match” message and it shows that the killer DCed but I’m playing with a friend and they’re still connected to the game.

---
Kids like a mountain
---
Not always its swf... and still u loose soo much time looking for totems, at least if they guve a totem counter, probably works.
---
The Game too
---
[Yes, gen tapping works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm2FBVvu2ro).  People in this sub often say no because it's a common idea that it's cheating or unfair and will actively downvote an opposing opinion.
---
When done efficiently, it's 25-30% slower than a perfect generator repair with no chance of explosion.
---
Never trust a Myers, he could have Tombstone.
---
Wow if that really hurt u, im sorry, i shouldnt make mistakes...
---
Wow.
---
This is such a bullshit statement. If you’re going around and can’t do 5 totems in a game between 4 people, then you’re a really bad survivor.
---
legion has the gaunlet. i posted about it.
---
My current build is ruin, bbq, m&amp;a, and thanataphobia. Does good to help slow the game down while you apply pressure. Haven't really found my favorite add ons just yet but you cant go wrong with cool down add ons. Id reccommend checking out tru3talent on youtube, hes been posting alot of legion gameplay since the rework.
---
I like that idea and the cooldown would be somewhere in the 4-6 second range I assume? So it isn’t too op at base lvl without add ons
---
If the killer 4k because of NOED is just because survivors played poorly.
---
Alot of people saying the same thing though which is reassuring! I guess it's only good against NOED or where you dont cleanse otherwise Adrenaline is strictly better?
---
I'm almost certain they do.  
---
Why not try it out anyways? You could see the difference after 2-3 gens.
---
I agree NOED is a pretty broken and can be a pretty cheap perk except for certain circumstances. Maybe make it so it has one token for sure, and then one for every totem remaining on the map when the gens are done? That's a max of 6 tokens. It would punish survivors for not cleansing during the match, but limit the perk to help prevent a 4k in the endgame while not making it useless. But maybe it's not tied to a specific totem, so it cant be wiped out in the endgame. Just a thought
---
:( why they gotta make it so hard on us
---
Seems tough but I'm down to try it, I noticed alot of the streamers wont run it if they are in a party or are lower ranks so maybe it is clutch to change it up

It sounds like we have different interpretations of how we have fun in this game which is fair. To each their own. I do agree it makes the match a joke when I’m playing to the best of my ability. But I have more fun playing casually and letting survivors get saves and giving people the hatch etc. I know I can 4K at high ranks consistently, so I like to just chill when I play now
---
Someone else said it, but it can not be understated. PLAY TRAPPER. Haddonfield is to Trapper what Coldwind is to Billy. It’s insane. Loops prime for the trapping, traps you can’t get around w/o disabling, it’s a god send.
---
I thought it was just me getting tunneled 😂
---
Is the infinite mend still in the game?
---
yay!!!
---
The only way I could see it even remotely useful is if the Killer for whatever reason decides to stand on top of the hatch. But that's just a waste.
---
You can partially counter MoM by tunneling the person, but then they would just complain. But like you said, the downside can be easily countered
---
Ehhhhh i dont feeeel like it
---
ty
---
i have noticed you are a man of culture as well

*Passionate Hate for furries intensities*
---
I mean with that logic u can tell that to just about any post. Thicc Jane, t-bag survivors, op builds, ppl asking about advice on a killer, etc. It's a subreddit lol and it's a pretty decent sized one at that, posts are gonna repeat ALOT lol.
---
10000% agree. But you know some survivors wants all M1 killers letting them scape.
---
No, is because noed is bullshit, uf the killer comes to u with his +4% movement speed and insta down, and the two doors are in open area, ur fucked.
---
Let's just put every killer in Freddys Dreamworld. That should solve it.
---
I think it should also have a normal cooldown like dance with me. But an exhaustion perk?
---
i’m on PC and i still can’t play nurse...
---
No, it means the experience playing killer, like cmon, if i can play every killer witouth noed, other killers can too
---
We do though....
---
It's in the 80's pack DLC.
---
[inverted for visibility](https://i.vgy.me/UHxEkJ.png)
---
I couldn't agree more. Don't like what the killer is doing? Try everything to make them fail. Don't DC and wait 15 minutes for the game to end to harass the killer.
---
Freaks out big time “WHAT THE FU—“
---
Oh, I got it free on ps4 thanks, have a good one
---
I dont know
---
Upvote for not tbagging
---
Aye, everybody enjoys the game in a different way and that is all good. I wouldn't look down on someone who's having fun with broken stuff.
---
I don't sweat most of the time, I let people unhook and give hatch too. I try to keep it fun while also giving it a good try. If I see the game is going well I'll play nicer, if it's sweaty I'll be sweaty. 
---
Just to clarify in reference to the original post, that is basically why I'm not happy to see NOED in my bloodweb.
---
There are hundreds of posts where people complain about this perk or that. They wont acknowledge their broken perks they just gotta blame their loss on a broken perk. Git gud. Learn to outplay. Look for the totem yourself. More importantly though. Quit whining. No one cares. It shows that you are unskilled and unwilling to improve.
---
please don’t remind me of that song
---
We do have it, I just checked on my PC and it was there.  
---
The College Letterman should be a part of The 80's Suitcase DLC
---
They do add some in like the firecrackers which are always fun to play with if nothing else. 
---
Most things to aid a generator or heal would be addons for med kits and tool boxes so it would need to be a whole new mechanic.
---
I thought of a small trap like item that you place on the floor and after a certain amount of time would trigger an audio check for the killer like missing a skill check in game. Sort of like a decoy. The addons could be stuff to change the timer on the decoy or the visibility of it to hide it from the killer or give it more uses. Like the basic one would have one use and the yellow would have 2 uses and so on
---
Aww thank you!!! It was really stressful, we both hadn't played for over a month so we weren't up to date with the endgame collapse, so when the countdown started and I still had the trap on I was pretty much just yelling nonstop and rocking back and forth. Love &amp; hate this update!
---
I'd much rather get improved frames and more customization options, but yeah bills cool
---
Lord I hope not 😂
---
Spirit is always a good buy. Top rate killer nice perks. Has nice cosmetics. Full package.
---
Panda is that you?
---
Cuuuuute
---
Either Spirit or Hag.  
---
Spirit's fun to play and has got Spirit Fury.  
---
Hag's a little less fun(imo), but she's got Ruin, Devour Hope and Third Seal.
---
You have to go to the front page of the subreddit on browser and flair will be on the right side of the screen
---
I'd rather have 10 farming killers over that boring Basement Defender bullshit. Imma go down there and blind you all day long if it gets you out of there and playing the video game.
---
You must never get hit by Legion then from the sounds of it. Literally ever, eh?
---
Most of my matches are Xbox aren’t toxic
---
We're not all like that, promise
---
Helpful with Billy in tight corner spaces or at Jungle gyms. Billy still M1’s people in a match. Have you ever gone a match as Billy without an M1 hit?
---
The overall atmosphere of the game was actually horror based. If you look at old videos from then to now it's like a cartoon compared to what it used to be.
---
We survivors need to run and hide  from a dude that we cant even hurt and can literally put you down  even if you are like a mile away from the weapon. And lets dont forget about the bunch of perks you have to make everything more difficult like I cant even heal with a perk that reveal my aura
---
what a piece of shit lol can’t wait to try it
---
Yeah? How so? Want to know more
---
F for freddy? 
---
Honestly I dont think freddy is that bad but I know hes a whole meme. 
---
But sure. These look fine.
---
RT
---
Why is Plagg and Michael so low?
---
What the fuck are you guys smoking, that is clearly P3 Claudette.
---
Oh no not my hole
---
In his newest video he made 3 DBD jokes, love him
---
Drag race memes are the best DBD memes
---
Won't lie yes in some cases just using M1 saves you a lot of time. But for me personally i'd swap out NOED with something else since I'll mainly use my Power but to each their own.
---
Groaning Storehouse and Rancid Abattoir
---
Damn you take this all wayyyyy too seriously.
---
You’re supposed to walk out of it
---
Solid but I would push plague and Michal up 2 tiers
---
dude thats why i barey use MoM because ur also the obsession
---
In my opinion, it's a fun perk.  
---
It allows you to get chased easily as survivor(or... completely ignored at times, which may be funny for itself) for more killer-survivor interaction.  
---
As killer, the survivor that runs it is usually good, so I have fun chasing them.
---
I typically down the recently unhooked person and chase/down the unhooker. That's 2 people not doing anything instead of just one. Then you have a 3rd or 4th person coming to help the downed person.
---
Like damn bro this is why this community is considered toxic. ☝🏼
---
OMG THESE ARE THE EXACT KILLERS THAT HAVE NOED!
---
...but isn’t a 4K winning, not losing?  I’m confused.  Either way late game builds DO exist, you know that right?
---
:-)
---
Only nice survivors I've ever met say "Gg" then Immediately leave, and there was only one guy who I talked with because he liked this one time I played Freddy
---
Deep sleep mechanic? The more times you're slept the longer you stay asleep? If it's more lore based I wonder if that means I can pop out randomly at survivors like in the movies.
---
Next update could bring the rework, guessing they don’t want to release too much at once.  EGC and legion rework were a lot already
---
I’ll take your ad hominem as your white flag of defeat.
---
Or, you know, just Tier 3 into Full Health? Or, just never hit them withoit Tier 3 so it doesnt charge fast enough?
---
Have you played against the new legion? They basically are a noninstadownspeedbuffed hillbilly with wall hacks. so like unless the legion is the fire instead of the car, you are incorrect xD
---
Definitely not what I was going for put I can really see it now that you mention it haha.
---
Nah I just don’t care enough to read your wall of text
---
Usually when I chase a Survivor with OoO they're pretty bad at chases and mindgames
---
You can sort of counter stbfl if you realise the killer is using it as the obsession, you can force him to target you and bodyblock and such.
---
I would put legion much lower, he has decent stall but no chase after the first hit.
---
You can loop him like any other 115% movement speed killer.
---
If you know how to use pallets and windows, a normal Billy (that is not using broken add ons) is as balanced as a killer can be. He's strong while having clear counterplay. Against good survivors Billy gets crushed.
---
I did use Jane a bit, but she's dummy thicc and the clap of her ass cheeks kept alerting the Killer.
---
Meh though I dislike NOED I can see why it’s a thing, its to help new players/counter adrenaline.
---
How about we remove the killer's ability to hit survivors? sounds good to me, a good nerf because KiLleRs ArE ToO Op.
---
WAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAP!!!!
---
Only because you got spanked.
---
We can only hope it’s not shit. Either way I’m hyped as shit.
---
I'd say base billy is fine. His add ons are the problem.
---
Charge speed add ons, cooldown add ons and movement speed add ons combined with charge speed add ons make him too powerful.
---
Yes you ttly pwned me
---
EVERYONE HIDE! Dwight knows what he did!
---
I would start with a simple to learn killer. 
---
So something like Leatherface is a good place to start so you cna learn the game more.
---
Oopsie woopsie owo I jwust accwidentwawwy stwuck a rusty nwail in wour wounds úwù

Rank reset, if they are not going to get a ton of BP in the match they would rather quit and go to another. Save BP, get good items, then power rank up.
---
That’s not tunneling though. Not at all. He’s TRYING to kill you. Tunneling is when there are other people around and doing objectives that the killer can see but the killer doesn’t care. That is tunneling.
---
If they come to get you right when you get taken off the hook then their probably tunneling you. But then again, there are killers in the game that can down you again way faster than legion.
---
Sweet? You mean Dweet?
---
Because people who play killers &gt; people who play survivor
---
Which is partially what I mean by "don't want to try that hard". You do have to be extremely aware of what you're doing with your camera in order to refrain from using it at bad times, which often means just staring at the gen you're M1ing. Often makes gens even more tedious.
---
I usually do that but I was doing a daily
---
In some cases yes but if the last gen pops with the Killer on you there's not much you can do.
---
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. Someone has answered my prayers! I was so excited for the release of this perk you don’t even know, but you’re right, it just doesn’t work. Because of this I have been basically forced to go back to balanced landing.
---
They need to change the way the stun works.
---
1) make the radius larger 
---
2) reduce the 3 sec delay (to 2?)
---
3) actually make the perk fucking consistently work.
---
Brutal Strenght? \*\*MORE LIKE NEVER DROPPING PALLETS\*\*
---
When the double pallet loop with window on the Coldwind map comes up, I always have PTSD from how long I would get looped as poor Huntress :(
---
Yep, but in his pizza delivery skin, if there's actually pizza in there, it's just gonna be mush by the time he's back at the campfire XD
---
I am a shameless multishipper, crossovershipper and polyshipper - especially with Dwight. I ship him with almost every other character because he can fit to so many different matches and have great chemistry. Personally it isn't too big of a stretch to imagine the survivors becoming so close that many of them delve into romantic and sexual partnerships, throwing away societal expectations of monogamy due to being in The Fog and having deep trust for the others there. 
---
And as unrealistic as it may be, I do love me some good killer/killer and killer/survivor. Many of the killers were once victims, and this could be padded and embellished to better create a semi-functioning relationship. Not healthy, but functioning. An example could be Feng just going in a relationship with The Doctor for mutual sex relief but oops plot and emotions. Or The Pig and Laurie having a vicious rivalry that through plot uncovers they actually fit together pretty well. Or the likes of Claudette, Kate, Jeff and Dwight whom have high empathy and compassion which could turn into more. Or there could be exchanges made in terms of {likely Dwight} sexually gratifying a killer for luxuries appearing at the campfire. And the killers might not bond like the survivors but they probably gain respect or attraction, which will be exploited via plot. 
---
It would probably be easier to list the ships I don't have rather than the ones I do. I can only see Bill with the older survivors, like Ace, Tapp, Adam and Jane. Nobody likes Kreuger, not even The Entity, for obvious reasons. I don't see Shape/Doctor or Shape/Nurse ever working out due to his imprisonment in a mental institution. Leatherface and Hillbilly would probably have a familial relationship, not a romantic or sexual one. I see Lisa as, if not thirteen, still very young and not probable to end up with older killers or survivors if she goes for any of them at all. Other than that it's free-range shipping chaos for me.
---
At certain times it’s almost impossible to find games like after 8pm I can’t find games or it takes a long time to find one
---
Dude obviously didn’t want to play against a Legion, you need to chill bro.
---
PS, he’s right about your trash memes fam
---
I think they should add a one time use stim shot kinda deal that can boost stamina/ get rid of exhaustion temporarily.
---
Op builds change with the meta 
---
 Thicc Jane isn’t popular anymore 
---
There are still some posts about t bagging but still not a lot about them and they are mostly discussing if it’s toxic or not 
---
People asking for advice is a good thing as it actually helps someone.
---
As you can see all of those have some variations but getting camped is always the same a survivor on the hook and a killer in front of them.
---
It brings absolutely nothing to the table, it’s not funny, it doesn’t start a discussion and if you defend camping on one of these post you  get downvoted. It’s just a picture of s survivor and a killer that’s it. No interesting discussion, no fun, no nothing. 
---
The only other posts that don’t bring a discussion are the “I hit rank 1 posts” those also don’t bring anything new besides some people congratulating op.
---
Man I gotta see that red devil front and back. Can you help me out with stills?
---
It’s one of the dumber strategies I’ve heard: “We could sell the character and make money, but we won’t because...”
---
There is no acceptable way for that sentence to end.
---
Once you go Jake, you never want a break. From maining him. Cuz he’s the best male survivor. 
---
...
---
I’ll see myself out.
---
Maybe, some people stop playing during rank reset but I can’t find games during specific times generally
---
Question: Can you use Iridescent Shards to unlock it?
---
The date...
---
Bad logic- if they licensed and sold the character on other platforms, they WOULD make money from those platforms. There is no acceptable reason to avoid making money.
---
Wow what a new point of view, this has never been stated before in this history of dbd
---
When I get that 5th stack I orgasm. No shame
---
Every day. At night it's worse if you want to play survivor. Seems like everyone else does too except for that one Leather Face I keep getting paired up with.
---
Was expecting him to walk over to it at the end, and it instant downs him.
---
Rank 1 killor and survivor. Doesnt mean anything tho. Just because ur rank 1 deosnt mean shit. Its all an opinion that im allowed to have. And yes i know it has counters. But compared to alot of other shit not enough counters.
---
That would make it actually a strong perk. Think about this. Fast vault into locker in shack when looping the killer with Q&amp;Q. Wait three seconds as they wonder where you are. When they come to check locker fast vault out with head on, and vault the window with lithe. You basically escape any chase for free
---
Botany is 33% meanwhile Mangled is 20%. You still technically heal 13% faster
---
\&gt;mentions an item that isn't even good  
---
\&gt;purposely omits mori which alone more than makes up for going perkless  
---
god i missed this subreddit
---
I mean frankly it doesn't matter if he didn't want to play Legion, him leaving fucked everybody else over. It made another guy DC (just as toxic tbf) and the last two would've depipped if I didn't let them farm 3 gens and show them my ruin.
---
Still a valid argument; there are many ways to find the totems before the end game, and you have 4 minutes to find it and get the guy off the hook.
---
If you don't want to do that because "it's not going to get me out, gens will", then that's on you, not on NoED.
---
Tattoo looks good before sabo jake comes around
---
She is my new main and I can clean house with her but keep in mind I'm just a green rank. She is tough to get a handle on at first. I enjoy her base power but I never use her own perks. You need to adopt a gen control play style and learn when it's appropriate to use your corrupt purge. I recommend her because she is fun to play with and against.
---
How does this perk works again? (Sorry)
---
I find most survivors that run Object to be at least decent.
---
r/woosh
---
Her default stance is really just standing there unbothered. "NOED? Don't know her. *breaks hex totem*"
---
😂 someone else literally posted a NOED salt right before this
---
“Killer main btw” for me personally I don’t feel like listening to you at that point, it doesn’t matter if you play killer or not you’re allowed to have an opinion just don’t be annoying about it
---
I wish but it didn't do anything to me lol
---
\*\*NOTE: These are based on perkless, so plague and myers are low because their both M1 killers, except myers gets insta down. Also I know Plague has corrupt purge but smart survivors will learn she's just a glorified M1 killer after not cleansing.
---
Should have been Quentin
---
Haha I'm in the exact same position as you hopefully this will get the devs attention but I very much doubt it, the idea I loved the actual perk just dont work
---
I love it because most people who run this perk are typically dogshit and if they are downed within 20-30 seconds they'll DC. Makes it more fun as a Killer player. Seeing them DC is beyond enjoyable. Never failed to make an Object DC.
---
Freddy is too low, Hag should be A, Clown is too high, Mike is way too low, and Legion and doc too low
---
Dude same. EAC spooks me but this might be worth the risk.
---
Do you main Plague by any chance?
---
[PS4] Exact thing happened to me. Two people DC and then Nurse downed and hooked me and last person was nowhere to be found. Dead.
---
Second match a Meg and Meyers working together to farm and kill whole team and I was taken out first. It’s really disheartening.
---
Fedora man f tier, 7 seconds to hit a survivor &gt;:(
---
I usually don't have problems this bad, and specially with killers I usually get lobbies pretty fast. But today it seems I can't play the game. It's like theres no one playing today.
---
How about we remove noed and MoM together and never add similar perks to them ever again
---
I left a supporting comment, seems like a lot of player who play survior only targeted you, feels bad man
---
it really sucks i'm from Canada and i barely meese. (plural for moose XD)
---
what even is the point of this? does this community still have problems grasping the fact that not having a counter doesn't necessarily make something broken (and same for the opposite)?  
---
also this isn't a turn based game, which makes it even more sterile of a point for arguing balance; you can (in theory) for example do all totems to prevent noed, but that's probably gonna be more detrimental than just ignore them unless the killer is complete garbage (and even then he may very well not have noed, but the two go hand in hand).
---
It's all good
---
Balance wise, I think Billy is completely fine. Against good survivors he's an M1 killer with good map control.
---
I'm a lil miffed that Leatherface is pretty much scuffed Billy. Billy's chainsaw has the mobility and the kill potential, Leatherface's has neither.
---
You expected a dead by daylight meme, but it was me, DIO!!
---
HEY NOW, YOU'RE AN ALL-STAR
---
I'm fairly certain he is.
---
Happened to me earlier with a Doctor, it was just me and a Kate left in the match, he slugged me, Kate healed me once, he slugged me again, so I just crawled to the corner and waited to bleed out. Kate got the hatch, so I still consider it a win.
---
Spirit is NOT better than Billy, come on guys
---
Or huntress
---
7 days of stats is what you have.....I will admit that I had outdated stats but it seems very unlikely that the SWF percentage would go down the longer the game is out, especially that significantly. Wish we could see a whole season of stats. I play on PS4 and would say that half of my games are either 2+ SWF from the start, or while loading turn into a 3+ SWF. When playing as a survivor I get added to a group on more than half of my games. Which gives survivors a huge advantage, hence why NOED is fair.
---
This makes my day playing Killer
---
You know, it would’ve cost you zero dollars to not write this.
---
Doesn’t Hag come with the game?
---
Lol it gives the Killer a legit reason to camp the hook unless that hex is Devour Hope :(
---
This is so cute ;; I love Billy lol
---
does that happen to everyone or just like one person?
---
This makes me feel warm inside. ;;
---
1. You shouldn't get the most reward for happening to be the last one alive. That is very easily achievable by contributing absolutely nothing and hiding all game. You aren't entitled to a win or even a good chance at a win just because 75% of your team died.
---
2. Funny how the issue of map design goes under the radar for ages until it affects survivors.
---
Damn. that's pretty analytic and deep
---
Flash light blinds count towards points so technically it's still farming.
---
True enough, but I have only seen it a few times on ps4 as of yet.
---
Yeah they gete real mad when the truth hits.
---
Not when I bought it. It might’ve been included in it later on, I just know that when it was free for PS+ my friend only had to DL Lullaby and same for me when I bought it a few months later.
---
Fedora and sunglasses skin dwights in my experience are the most cocky creatures on earth
---
I think Freddy is better than Leatherface at the very least, his power is still kinda up in the air right now, but it's better than Leatherface.
---
I’m guessing you use MoM?
---
Claudettes probably. I was never a fan of her. Her skins are fire though
---
I'd love to see the whole season of stats as well. But your claim that the higher the SWF count = higher advantage is unfounded to the stats we have. 
---
Look at party size survival rate. From solo to 4 man SWF, the rate only goes up by 8%. That's not enough of a difference to say that they have a "huge advantage", and definitely not enough to just up and say "NOED is fair". Remember, SWF can 'at the least' communicate how many totems are broken, which gives them a distinct advantage over NOED. 
---
NOED isn't justified as a counter for SWF (considering it was part of the game before SWF anyway). It more often than not punishes the solo players who CANNOT communicate. In other words, the people who are playing the most "fair" by killer standards (because they hate SWF), are the ones unfairly punished the most by it.
---
I tried to let the two remaining survivors do gens and leave, and one did, but the other felt bad that I missed out on two counts of hook points because the DC'd right when I caught them.
---
Ruin, bbq, enduring and spirit fury
---
Ruin to slow the game
---
BBQ for bloodpoints and it's really helpful on wraith because you can hook someone, cloak and barrel down on an unsuspecting survivor (works especially well with windstorm)
---
Enduring because wraith eats pallets for breakfast
---
Spirit fury to get a free hit and a free pallet destroyed
---
The sweat that drips down his balls?
---
Pretty much what I do. 1 disconnect - if I'm feeling charitable and it's early in the match, 2 disconnects - 100% gonna let those guys farm down to 2 remaining before I carry on, 3 disconnects - that poor bastard's getting the hatch stomp then free exit gate escape.
---
Yeah. Just dont like that a lot of killers get a bunch of non earned kills from a perk. Im very aulturistic and its hard to save people when u cant find noed or its next to a hooked survivor.
---
i see that you've seen that quote too!
---
ANOTHER UPDATE TIME
---
\-Gold Portrait's quality GREATLY increased
---
\-Made Gold Portraits optional
---
Myers is a solid B. Lowest Terror Radius in the game for a visible killer. Immune to detection perks at EW1. Instadowns survivors with EW3, increased lunge, faster vaulting.
---
Cannibal is king of C tier. All the shortcomings of the other M1 do nothing killers but has a 1HKO that has an AoE and hits multiple times.
---
Legion is B despite the nerfs. 10 seconds of 125% movement speed and the ability to vault pallets let's him get around better than anyone that isn't Nurse, Spirit, and Billy. Deep Wounds reveals other survivors allowing you to keep them off of generators. Just a pain to deal with.
---
Besides that I think you're pretty spot on.
---
flip a coin, if tails the killer hits you through pallet, If heads dwight sandbags you and you dc
---
*get downvoted for promoting the use of a killer that isn’t super meta and trying to add variety to red ranks*
---
I usually do exactly that, but today it has worked 0 times for me.
---
Remember when that building could spawn 4 pallets at once? Sad times indeed. Even with half as many it's still one of the strongest loops in the game
---
Thank you u/PM_ME_UR_FURRY_PORN! Very cool!
---
You can juggle survivors in sleep stage and hunt them down fairly easily. Yeah he has big downsides but I have no issue 4k with him so I dont see why hes f tier. Hes definitely a setup killer, he needs time to ramp up and get people asleep so he has pressure, but I dont see that being a bad thing. There are upsides to his power as well. Slow survivor speed, force them to regress generators or lead you to their allies to wake up, or otherwise you can see their aura map wide. Overall I enjoy playing him.
---
Some quality of life changes I would like for him would be to let him kick generators even if survivors are working on them, and for them to fix the auto aim issue that was mentioned. That one really sucks.
---
Not controversial, just think people are underestimating his powers potential. I'm fine with him being considered the worst killer but If put him d at worst.  F implies hes a failure, and if even I can 4k with him [and I suck] I cant imagine how he failed as a killer.
---
Farming is boring
---
I believe Tinkerer reduces the radius to 0 for a short time when a generator gets to 80% repaired (you'll also get a notification of which gen it is).
---
It's like you guys are all in my games
---
You used a lery’s map offering tho. Sick
---
i really don't think you play fortnite if you think that the game isn't buggy and gets buggier with every patch
---
I was giddy like a school girl when I heard those references haha
---
Queuing when you just start will take a while. The game tries to match you with players of a similar rank. However, there is a floor to how long people can derank after they've ranked up. Once you get around rank 15, your queues should go much faster.
---
