If you see a large metal sliding door, chances are there is a generator somewhere around it. If I‚Äôm having trouble finding a generator, I just look for one of those doors.

Does he still play dbd?

I actually like a lot playing him, and dont usually run into a lot of problems in my ranks (7-5)

I‚Äôm sorry if the link doesn‚Äôt work, reddit confused me :,)

Well Ghost Face is still licensed, but from the mask company rather than the movie company. So they still have to get approval from Fun World, they‚Äôd can‚Äôt exactly do whatever they want
---
Other folks made the puppets and sculpts, I just arranged them like this
---
Well Leatherface was a solid sculpt so I had to turn him into a playable character but I didn't do any of the actual modelling of him
---
Idk what game you're talking about, but this is a dead by daylight sub Reddit..
---
sarcasm, my Dude...
---
Akali mid? You bad, bad man.
---
I don't know if it was intentional or not by the person that sculpted him, but I love lil baby Freddy haha
---
I get the joke but it's not about buffs or nerfs.  Hes just broken, it's inconsistent and that's why it's broken.
---
Allow you to take in the role of the pig in the next trial
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just normal lag. When it‚Äôs lag switching you usually get hit when the killer is nowhere near you and you instantly teleport back to a place you already ran past.
---
I know the feeling, far too often Have I done a daily killer game where I decide to be nice and never hook anyone and if I down will chain drop from shoulder to get them back on feet only to have end game chat of "noob killer" or "ezgame"

Tier 1 Michael intensifies
---
I'd be happy if they did an H20 cosmetic set for both Michael and Laurie. I REALLY want a Halloween 2 ('81) set though. Like Michael's mask could look all dirty, shows where he got shot and stabbed on his body, along with the bloody tears on his mask. Maybe even a weapon skin too- the bread cutting knife he picks up after the opening credits in Halloween 2. Laurie's cosmetic could be the hospital attire she wears throughout the movie!  
---
But if I had to guess which movie looks they're going to do, it'll probs be Halloween 2018.
---
I‚Äôve sat and waited 5 mins before... then it finally kicked me back to the main lobby!
---
Honestly not a fan of the jacket but pair the head with the dress shirt and blazer it looks real nice
---
Wish I could get these in sticker form, I'd never use the patches.
---
I had someone in my lobby named "Lynch Africans" which I thought was pretty gross. It was the only time I've intentionally tunneled the fuck out of someone.
---
The is a gross repost

Give the man a break, he's obviously lagging.

You‚Äôre letting a person decide if you play a game or not?

I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs $12.

Congrats, now you can pick what teachables you want from other survivors and get them straight on her!
---
Why should I play if I get chats like these all the time? It‚Äôs just bad, it makes me feel bad... and they always get away with it
---
It's been hard without ds
---
Look, Killers! Another whiney survivor! The Entity will be pleased!
---
i always do as long as it is not in the beginning of the game. although if I am chasing someone I won't just turn to go for the hook as honestly, that was dumb to od
---
Look, Survivors! Another cringe-worthy killer to teabag at the exit gates!
---
(I don‚Äôt detect any whining in this meme...but okay.)
---
This reminds me of a LF who was AFK the whole match but as soon as we finished the gen next to him, he started moving and downed a Dwight that was running around in front of him with NOED.
---
Some much craziness went on and I was the only survivor.
---
You started the chat in the first place.
---
Damn, they should've done it honestly. Though the look of the lab as a map is neat. 
---
I know a brightly colored map might not fit but that's why I think it would be neat
---
I actually play an equal mix of killer and survivor. I‚Äôm not complaining at all, this is a meme. I‚Äôm sorry you took it seriously.
---
I have heard of someone who died from masturbaiting so much, I guess it‚Äôs as dangerous as drug addiction
---
Xbox doesn‚Äôt show it but when I stopped replying she kept texting. Also I began because I had to ask her...
---
Aw heck yeah, love this song, nice job on the art man.
---
I wasn't the one taking anything serious. Hence the playful nature of my comment, but okurrrrrr.
---
No he was very weak but fun to play and I saw legion a lot of times and play againts him was pretty exciting , but he has a exploit that to be honest I saw like 2 times in 4 months
---
Now he is unfun to play and very easy to win and is one of the killers that nobody uses, i saw him like 6 times after the nerf
---
Why are you trying to play victim in a situation that you started?
---
Damn man, you're so fricking right. 
---
Damn, he's gonna lose that match, but does it really care? Most of the time I see here people that seems to forget that we play for FUN, and are only task/rank/kill oriented. I'm sure he had a lot of fun running from that Meg, and it's good in this way. He had fun, they too, the purpose of the game is fulfilled.
---
Don‚Äôt bully someone who will ruin your life with their brutal strength. Bond with them instead.
---
I hate that you lose offerings when people DC. I have yet to lose a good one but I‚Äôve lost a few decent pieces of equipment and addons
---
no
---
Because of "dedicated servers"
---
Yah you are high key a clown
---
I made this before I saw that someone posted it like 20 mins ago. Notice the caption is different
---
insta downs shouldn't be base kit it only works for the chainsaw boys and Michael
---
Something about this picture makes me hate it.
---
Really nice quality
---
No, it doesn't. They don't release updates on Fridays.
---
Legion got taken down to miss frenzy you fucked M1 killer
---
If you make one send me the link please
---
Ah, I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well. I‚Äôve got a few minifigures that would be great for this.
---
No matter what, virtually every survivor will complain regardless of the killer you use.
---
Pig Mains unite. 
---
Also, I'm literally in the same boat as you, I stopped playing once it came out, and I downloaded it again yesterday.
---
Him playing it would be god tier
---
It's better when you watch someone go down and get hooked across the map with no idea who the killer is. Work on your gen and a hatchet comes at you from the opposite side of the map and pegs you in the head before you hear a thing.
---
It goes black after the killer picks up a survivor no matter what. There was still time left on it fam
---
I thought it applied to all of them. I could be wrong.
---
Which one?
---
Oh wow, I totally missed that. That's definitely something to be excited for. Thanks for the info.
---
Shirtless Myers
---
Bruh, her passives seem -extremely- strong. I'm gonna use the scratch mark one for damn sure. May actually make sprint burst more useable since walking around to hold it would be much faster. 
---
That being said, I've learned to hold it at the little sliver right before exhaustion refreshes anyway, but my point stands the same.
---
Someone's salty, it's never too late to add survivor themes.
---
must have scared her pretty bad lol!
---
Thanks for the useful information. What does the obsession mean? I'm new to the game and it has so many mechanics to remember.
---
No error. Whenever i load into a match (even past the lobby screen), The camera rotates and then my game freezes if i dare move my killer and then it picks up and goes between 0 and like 2 fps for the rest of the match. Thinking its one of my tower's parts that may be fried or just needs an upgrade.
---
Didnt see that one , but if its only once its not like a signature power or anything so ... Its a no from me tbh
---
lmao pig and other older killers don't get themes either
---
Horrible idea. Clown has the tools to exploit Pinky Finger, it being base kit is seriously too oppressive. There's a reason it's an addon.
---
First off, adding a one shot to his base wouldn‚Äôt help his abysmal map pressure, it would just make him even more frustrating to deal with in chase. Second off, clown is no where near the worst killer in the game, I‚Äôd rather they fix Leatherface of rework legion the way they did Freddy. Let‚Äôs focus on fixing the shit killers before we start tweaking the mid-tiers
---
Ochido hasn't been a thing in DBD anymore for a very long time lol
---
Thanks! If the do ever do this hopefully it‚Äôs well executed
---
What are you trying to prove? Ashs theme is already made and I suggested they add it ingame. They dont get themes because they didnt decide to make themes for killers till recently.
---
‚ÄúRushed‚Äù like it‚Äôs not the objective of the game lmao
---
Yeah thats the fun part with any entitled player.
---
nice job! :)) the first one always hits different
---
Wait you can use shards to unlock characters instead of buying them?
---
Is this possible on consoles?
---
No problem ma dude. There is a huge learning curve and a lot to get used to. Just stick with it and ask questions and dead by daylight can be a rly fun game!
---
It's a mechanic related to perks. The killer has some perks that make someone the obsession, and they will get benefits by keeping you alive (or killing you faster, depending on the perk). Also, some survivor perks (notably Laurie's) make you the obsession.
---
They aren‚Äôt great, my buddy and I used to load into games and scream LETS DO THIS. It was the only remotely funny thing to come from his channel
---
they can't just add it ingame it does work like that. they need to re-arrange their contract with the studio that made ash vs evil dead. it's not happening anytime soonm
---
Looks good man!
---
I feel this is one of the biggest keys to success as a killer. I drop a chase as soon as I realize a survivor can out loop me. I just hope to catch them in a less favorable situation later.
---
Your getting downvoted just for the okurrrr
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Obsession# here's the wiki page for the mechanic. There are multiple perks that relate to the obession and it would take a lengthy amount of time to type them all out here. No auxiliary effects occur to the obsession other than whatever equipped perks the killer of survivor has equipped, but the movement of the tendrils does allow for every player to know when it is the obsession being chased rather than anyone else.
---
Thanks! Wanted to get the face of the game out of the way ASAP, so he was first on the bucket list. Most of the next batch I have planned are all licensed characters, but I‚Äôm definitely hoping to get Dwight and Nea done for my next characters created specifically for the game.
---
I mean he has a point
---
I would remove the different modes on doctor. His m2 would be the shock therapy and he would ALWAYS enjoy the static field. Calm addons terror radius changes would have to be different, it could just increase TR overall.
---
Holding m2 would have a charge bar, and the length you hold it changes the range of the shock, the hold time would be equal to what the range addons are now, you could just opt for shorter or longer shocks when needed. 
---
Speed would be his 115% punishment mode speed. TR would still be base 32
---
Wow they were trying to save their teammates from being hooked? That‚Äôs BS I can‚Äôt believe they would be so toxic
---
Resilience and left behind is broken when both active and it's unfair. Also that's unfair is spine chill and resilience, infinite vaults and their always faster than the killer
---
Yeah its so fucking stupid, I've had that happen to me while trying to play myers using a shard and it was impossible, I dont know why you have to lose the shard when they disconnect
---
That‚Äôs not how it works.
---
Everyone‚Äôs gangsta til someone touches bubba treasure chest
---
That means you are the obbsession. Some perks interact with it.
---
And when the claws move it means the Obbsession is being chased
---
Go play killer at rank 1 and tell me ruin (the perk you're referring to) is overpowered. Not trying to be rude, but I think you'll change your mind pretty quickly.
---
it possible on every platform.
---
Which is which? Because F13 is dead af
---
oh yea god forbid a killer every blocks someone from coming out of the basement though. fucking uproar. screw off double standard.
---
Can confirm. It happens regardless of positioning Or camera positioning. Camera could be up his asshole and he‚Äôs still considered hidden
---
What happened to him?
---
I had this glitch happen to me (on xbox) and while it was on the killer couldn‚Äôt hit me.
---
I would hardly call 3 weeks enough time to master a killer, and if you know how to run tiles, then you shouldn‚Äôt be struggling in chases, unless you‚Äôre using bottles incorrectly. The fact of the matter is that, while clown could use some love from the devs, adding to his already strong chase potential is not the answer
---
Exhaustion perks are no longer exhaustion-based, now cooldown-based   &gt;u&gt;
---
What rank are you?

Tru3 is lawful neutral and zubat is the most neutral guy there ever was

On characters that already have it any characters that do not have it or if you prestige wont be able to get it without leveling bill.

Well I mean that‚Äôs probably why he was camping lol 2 people trying to get you off hook seems like a camping move to me

My bad lmao. Wrong thread

Damn that must have been all your traps!

He camped ever since the game started

huntress, that sogng man

Gotta shut down god pallet somehow üòâüòÇ
---
16. Not sure if that's high or low, but all this way and I would have had no help from the game regarding this stuff. This Reddit's been a massive help. Are survivors and killers matched to be similar rank?
---
At least they didn't nerf HIM
---
he just wants his achievement

That's pretty impressi3vr doing that with Freddy lol

---
Take female characters' hands on Mori or last hook. Each occupies a hand: Kira's left, Kira's right, Killer Queen's left, and KQ's right. Kira loses mobility or attack speed with each hand, but passively generates BP for each.
---
Aren't chests and vaults two separate keys?
---
You are not a clown. You are the entire circus.
---
Makes sense.
---
Hmm, I'd say that 60/65% of the time I'll get a 4k or a 3k, people tend to group up against me for some reason and I get a lot of chain stabs which gives me time to m1 an injured survivor while the rest mend, I guess it all comes down to how much time can you make them waste since as a killer you want them off the gens.
---
Its not that hard, as long as you dont get obsessed with 1 surv you'll have a pretty good chance at keeping track of the game, just learn when to drop a chase, if you frenzy stab someone and you see someone close go for them, in the end most of the times they'll all be injured and they will be easy pickings for your m1 as a killer with 115% speed

‚ÄúPlay a normal killer idiot.‚Äù

You can report their steam name and they'd be made to change it idk if theyd get punished or not but theyd have to change it
---
And Jendenise is Supreme Kai
---
I vote we get the blood tears mask from the original sequel that seems like a reasonable cosmetic
---
Well is there a reason he was were you guys unhooking right after he unhooked?
---
I dont, I almost purchased in the shrine but didnt, I might go for it, maybe for a different killer? Only thing I dont like on my build now is tremors due to its cooldown cuz me no likey cooldowns lol but I was thinking of replacing it with the new mindbreaker when it comes out. A passive non totem perk that affects all survivors repairing a genny leaving them exhausted and keeps going  3 seconds after a leaving a gen. Most people dont run the first few seconds of a dream projection so by the time I got there they would still be fairly close.
---
You misspelled legion
---
It's the Bent Neck Lady.
---
Why couldn't they added both.
---
Also y'all don't understand how cool Detective üïµüèø Tapp is in the 1st movie especially in the game.
---
should've been his prestige
---
Lullaby overrides the terror radius and ignores terror radius perks, but a lesser known fact is that the terror radius still exists and therefore overwhelming presence (or any other terror radius perk) will trigger even if the survivor doesn‚Äôt hear your terror radius.
---
Ohmwrecker is a good one

That is good advice and a smart way to play legion however that‚Äôs not the point. You need to play very smart and well to win with the legion and can‚Äôt make many errors, like missing a frenzy swing pretty much puts u in a horrible situation. What I‚Äôm getting at is that other killers compared to legion are simply easier to win with and more consistent
---
Was literally in the middle of a Mori when the game froze, and I was standing over the Survivor for about 5 seconds.
---
Then, the Survivor I had downed and was mori'ing was teleported 10ft away from me, alive, and I was shot back about 10ft from where I originally was.
---
That‚Äôs the joke.

Read that in veigar's voice

they're not fun to play as or against at all

get it? Trump bad LOL!

how about you dont be toxic to someone for their political views fucking loser?

His last video was 7 months ago, did he stop making videos?

Nicely done! Nothing that I could wrong in this image!
---
In a locker

because the majority of the dbd community is a bunch of losers who get bullied at school and cant tolerate people with different political views, they‚Äôre like actual nazis lol

Where are they from, originally? Are they from a movie or show?

Just because there isn't one, doesn't mean he "avoided" anything.

Honestly Myers just needs more cosmetics, period. Give me this, H2 myers bloody-eyed mask, Halloween 2018 mask, and even Rob Zombie's mask.

Perhaps one day man.
---
Maybe try using your pointer and middle finger. Put the top of the stick in the middle of the two. I haven't tried changing it but ill look to see if you can i know you can remap some controls.
---
i have been main clown for around 2 months before leaving him 3 weeks before i post this, he became really boring and weak. I i mean meking him pressure better instead of actual map opressure its because, we already got 2 new map pressure killers and we have a total of 6 of them, so we dont need more killers who can run around the map and patroll gens better.
---
You can‚Äôt burn them anymore. But they‚Äôre still in my inventory
---
Thanks! As someone who plays both survivor and killer, I wanted to make fun perks to use for survivors that wasn't extremely unfair for the killer.
---
Legion is also weak af, but atleast he has movement and pressure.
---
It really isn't though, maybe you should just except the fact that it's a word that get used and is completely valid.
---
it's actually weird how kinda accurate this is.
---
He's actually the newest wwe wrestler, he's super scary yet super powerful, and pretty soon he may be getting a  shot at the world championship. I would say where to find information about him but I'm worried it might go against rule 2 of this reddit page.

Oh lord üòë

---
I get that. I play console with others in the party (makes playing killer harder, sure) it‚Äôs worth it when we get a dumb message from a toxic survivor and get to laugh about it (2-3 of us are playing killer at the same time) we crack jokes about dumb shit survivors do
---
My tip(s): I won‚Äôt say ignore it because I know how hard that can be, just crack jokes about it with some mates and enjoy the game. If you are really struggling you could go back up to rank 20 (or whatever rank you think you should be with that killer) and work your way back down. Laugh it off and enjoy the game how you play it, you don‚Äôt need to conform to the standards of survivors. Just don‚Äôt camp, don‚Äôt tunnel, and respect the 4% (for about 45 seconds) if the survivor wasn‚Äôt being toxic.

Are you on the ptb? If so it‚Äôs really about reach and kinda how the killer is the host of the server
---
Lol yea, better get used to it.
---
I think everyone in this community recognizes these guys. Also, every single one of them have a strong YouTube base as well as a large streaming community. What female can boast this?  Jendenise?  I have yet to see any YouTube video from her and she doesn‚Äôt really fit in here as I‚Äôve also never seen her play killer.  Cahlaflour?  Maybe, but she doesn‚Äôt have any presence on YouTube.  It‚Äôs like asking why they didn‚Äôt put in that King guy, they‚Äôre just not as big of a presence. 
---
Don‚Äôt shoehorn in your equality bullshit into something that lacks equals.
---
Well you could run Enduring to cut it down hard, but then that got nerfed.
---
The pocket dimension could lock them in place until they find their way out. Also, 96 would be cool, getting an incredible speed boost and instant pallet destruction when in the sight of a survivor.
---
Where's ScottJund?
---
To be fair it was pretty obvious
---
they were worse before
---
Lol
---
Oh ho hoooo yeaaaaaa they have
---
Coward.
---
Throw your bottles to slow survivors down during loops. If you time your throws they won‚Äôt be able to make it to a pallet. You can also use bottles to find stealthy players (as long as they‚Äôre not using Calm Spirit.)
---
The fact that you‚Äôve arbitrarily decided that only personalities with big Twitch and YouTube followings who also play both killer and survivor matter is awfully telling. Any more rules you can come up with to keep us from recognizing the women playing this game?
---
I usually look on BrickLink, where a bunch of sellers offer individual LEGO pieces. But since official parts can only do so much, I also use acrylic paint and sometimes clay to make them. Huntress and Pig will definitely need clay when I get around to trying them, but Kate should be easy, since there‚Äôs a variety of female hairstyles and heads that would work great for her. If you‚Äôre painting to get everything right, make sure you use really thin brushes and light dips of paint for fine details.
---
Indeed
---
Youre right lets just try the same stuff and keep the war going for another 20 years
---
The main goal is for survivors to do gens and escape. Yet, when they dont do gens and mess with the killer people complain... Right
---
Yeah where‚Äôs mr Panda!
---
Hahaha I bet the chat was angry
---
This guy died from masturbating 62 times in a row he was probably having the time of his life well what‚Äôs left of it

Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself, dingus.
---
You can check the ‚Äúrecently played‚Äù tab. Whichever name doesn‚Äôt belong to any of the survivors belongs to the killer
---
[deleted]
---
That reply makes absolutely no sense
---
You. You‚Äôre the troll.
---
rare hybrid meme
---
Lol! That‚Äôs a good one.
---
Do you have any idea how many times I‚Äôve been found sneaking around the map by a Clown just randomly throwing bottles? It‚Äôs actually a pretty helpful strategy. Especially when paired with perks like Whispers.
---
I don't understand survivors getting mad at others for cleansing. like what else are they supposed to do? stay broken for the rest of the game?
---
Sorry about the delay, but I never said this. I use, easily, about twenty different perks on my killers. Some have a few staples like Ruin or BBQ (when I‚Äôm bp hunting), but I totally mix it up, depending on killer. None of these perks fit into any of my go-to specific killer builds, or can reliable be counted on to create new builds that are strong. They‚Äôre just weak perks that I‚Äôll be blown away if people find success in them.
---
Ooo k some tips for advice. Get someone to play KYF with you so you can explore maps and all the best loop spots
---
You can‚Äôt edit game files on Console
---
welcome to the realm of the entity! ignore the toxic idiots in this game and have fun also dont get upset if you have a bad match because everyone has bad matches
---
DBD is the one she tells you not to worry about. I started to not like Ft13th after it was clear that once Jason found you, you were screwed. I feel like there‚Äôs still a chance to survive if the killer finds you in DBD.
---
Oh, not to mention that you need a pocket knife to disable bear traps. If Jason has five bear traps in front of the phone‚Äôs fuse box? Too bad, so sad.
---
And thank you. I finished him up today and figured I‚Äôd make a meme with it.
---
If you noticed he had two of them in the video
---
Welcome!
---
&gt; and that's what gets you a *rank up*. 
---
Tunneling is actually pretty effective at ranking up cause it makes it easy to 4k. But eventually you'll get to red ranks and it'll be A) harder to pip in short games, and B) more people run decisive.
---
That said, I don't really do it unless someone gives me a reason, cause it's miserable for survivors.
---
yes, it would be more fun to both parties to have more objectives. And btw, killers have to kill and defend gens (it would be cool still if they had one more objective though)
---
He barely checked gens when he wasn't chasing he never walked up to one directly or even bothered to kick them to save his PGTW. And he wasted so much time and pressure trying to get the insta downs. This was a fair match and there was no gen rush, there just wasn't any gen defense. (I'm a killer main btw)
---
Tbh, I'm very surprised anyone got this
---
The fact that there is only 2 maybe 3 viable killers out of like 16 of them just shows how flawed this game is for anyone playing killer
---
And he uploads regularly on that alt
---
Mlga only show the ping afaik
---
And DambNoHtml
---
Oh, clearly
---
Yea only happens to you, to me happened like 5 times between this years
---
He's Canadian, it all makes sense now.
---
I could be wrong but I think it's because the majority of Minecraft players years ago were a younger demographic and the older gamers made fun of them deeming it a "kids game." Now, these younger players are 18 to 25 and are the largest gaming demographic and now their positive opinion of the game is popular opinion. Just my unscientific two cents.
---
This happened in my game earlier to my friend. It was so funny he was zooming around the map
---
Lol I didn't even think it would work lmao yeah got some real hate mail on ps4 lol
---
Trying to balance the game for optimal players would shut out 90% of the player base. That is the exact reason Deathgarden was unsuccessful. It's okay to lose in DBD, better than trying to bring it to the point where absolutely no one wants to play anymore.
---
I dont play on steam but this is my understanding once the starts you can check it.
---
Sure. To be recognized, they must be recognizable. Unfortunately, most are not or for only the wrong reasons.  They have no place in this post, and would be doing a disservice to those who have enjoyed this post and don‚Äôt want radical societal culture in their DbD funnies.
---
Panda fan here
---
That's considered "optimal", yeah.  As someone who plays plague a bit, I prefer it that way.  I know a lot of plagues prefer cleansing though, bc tbh corrupt purge is a little busted
---
What do you mean?  I look for someplace to hide when I hear the heartbeat.
---
I feel he's one of the "good"
---
I did the same thing recently. I figured with the double BP and new bloodweb the grind shouldn't be too bad. And I doubt they will add any costumes from the movies for Freddy.
---
I don't think he needs Ruin. The two must-have perks are BBQ and Pop Goes The Weasel. Both are outstanding on him for obvious reasons. After that I run Corrupt Intervention with Thana. If I don't have good action speed add-ons I'll swap Thana for NOED or Franklins Demise.
---
I played during the earlier parts of paladins with my friend and just liked being a hypermobile healer. They seem to pump out characters tho
---
You could get 16k. 8k from Hunting and 8k from Deviousness. I'm assuming these are the only categories you'd get points in. 
---
This of course can go up if you're breaking pallets, gens, or hitting survivors. And you could get stacks of BBQ by hooking survivors, further increasing your gains.
---
Once I saw it was a video from truetalent I stopped watching it immediately.
---
I fucking L O V E  Bricky
---
No I don't think so as the perk specifies they need to be downed with a basic M1 attack.
---
(Hatchets, chainsaw, demo lunge, etc. Dont trigger Surge) 
---
So it's safe to assume it wouldn't trigger with a grab.
---
How have you been playing for years and yet are still terrible at ending chases? First it was three weeks, then two months, and now years?
---
Look man, I‚Äôve gone against actual decent Clowns and gotten my ass handed to me. I‚Äôve had Clowns use their bottles to find me while I was hiding, to blind me so I couldn‚Äôt see which side of a pallet they were coming from, and to slow me down just enough that I got downed before I could make a window or a pallet.
---
Clown doesn‚Äôt need his strongest add-on to be part of his normal kit. I hate to say this, but seriously, get good.
---
[reminds me of this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/317/larry.jpg)
---
I don‚Äôt camp or anything like that but I still hear that players are very toxic so I‚Äôm just wondering if they will be
---
Traps aren‚Äôt gay xdddd
---
Did he wiggle out tho
---
I never heard about him, but now my curiosity is wanting to know... who is he and why does everyone hates him?
---
Rest in Spaghetti, Never Forgetti
---
But I think you didn't accidentally recover you might of made it.
---
That's a reason I did it that way since the perks would seem more realistic and likely to be used. Even if Burt isn't added, it's still some good perk ideas for the devs to use for other future survivors.
---
"ight, imma head on"
---
Tyde is the only one i know/have watched. Why is he considered evil? He seems pretty chill to me.
---
Probably. I‚Äôm not that high of a rank for purple but as I get higher in rank, the matches become more toxic and less fun.
---
These are awesome
---
Oh, well io is basically a kitsune moon goddess. hint, thats why I said shes my waifu but not because of the fox parts.
---
No I killed them all
---
He was trying too hard to utilize his perks and add ons to their potential. I get it, they help you along your objective, but he was ignoring his objective to get this utility, which ended up costing him more
---
I‚Äôm a level 7 survivor the only time I get salty is when I get downed by the killer and they leave me on the ground while they look for the last survivor don‚Äôt do that and you‚Äôll still get flamed for other reasons but not by me.
---
Most of the worst is in green ranks in my opinion as that's where most people de-rank to. I'd say entering purples gets better.
---
Just up to your interpretation of toxic. There will be more players playing to win compared to green (more flashlights, instaheals, swf, etc) which can be seen as toxic by some players.
---
1) I‚Äôve never complained about a Killer body blocking the basement 
---
2) Those situations aren‚Äôt really comparable
---
Nany squeeler
---
Why though. As someone who literally only uses killers so everyone can get more BP and need to grind less I must ask, why do you hate us?
---
Damn I'm jealous
---
He survived the first movie as the game takes place between the first and second movie. And if you played the game you would understand all the actions Tapp had to make instead of running away for most of the game/movie like others.
---
I've had people dc when I'm trying to play a killer for free with no perks.
---
Darn splinters
---
NGL, the jacket is the weakest part of the set as her other cosmetics don't pair well with it.
---
Does he make tutorial videos? I'm really bad at this game
---
I live for these kind of moments
---
I heard it got changed in the PTB so the rang is 24 meters but you don't have to down with M1.
---
Im talking about finding people, im not reading that paragraph for doing rince and repeat
---
Hybrid is the messanger
---
Tons, he also explains everything he does in a game, why he does it, and what will come out of it even if it‚Äôs not a tutorial 
---
Just watching him play helped me
---
Okay, here‚Äôs the TL:DR:
---
Get good.
---
But The Huntress' mum died when she was a kid so **technically** that means she can never grow up ???
---
Pop and tinker is godlike
---
I'm a rank 6 survivor and my solo q teamates are toxic so I'd say yes
---
Exactly, which is why I'm still waiting for a survivor objective rework that can help the m1 killers actually see some playing time in higher ranks
---
*Spirit had never seen such bullshit in her un-life*
---
When I play killer (Freddy if that changes anything) and at high purples/ red ranks. Most people dont even type in the post-game but you do see more rare items.
---
Welcome! Glad to hear you're having fun :)
---
I don't watch a lot of DBD YouTubers, who do you recommend? the only one who pops up in search is Monto and I just don't like his personality and find him super annoying.
---
Kate, David, Plague and Trapper
---
Im aware of his mistakes in this video, Its just a more recent video to prove that if the killer mess up for a matter of seconds against optimal survivors the gens flies and its game over because this game doesnt have much things for survivors to do. I mean come on, is it so hard to have something else for survivors to do ? Do you have fun when you sit for 2 minutes straight doing gens ? Because I dont and thats why I just look for the killer and try to loop them. Can anyone here see my point ?
---
Your right, I don't understand the downvotes toward your opinion.
---
I think the third perk is kind of niche and not terribly useful but otherwise the concept is great! Love the first two perks a lot
---
Huntress and trapper!! Both daddies
---
Some one pass me the bleach
---
Shit this has me dying üòÇüòÇ
---
Yes it is
---
Probably because he hates the game and has a really negative outlook on it as a whole, even confirming that he only plays it because it makes him the most money for his videos/streams.
---
He's most likely on the "lawful" side of evil simply because he's really chill about it.
---
Enduring only mattered if you were on the basement stairs.
---
Otherwise, they'd always get to a pallet even with less time.
---
Red rank players in PTB right now are usually doing stuff like dropping the shack pallet without looping, trying to get 4+ loops out of an unsafe pallet, and farming their teammates without mercy.
---
I don't get it. They're not trying to farm with me, and they're all like 3s and 2s with some 8s thrown in.
---
My killer rank has been 13 for a while ever since I quit the ranking grind after hitting killer rank 1 a few seasons ago.
---
Are red ranks just like this now?
---
Play üëè The üëè first üëè game!
---
Would this be the easiest way to passively farm?
---
Definitely chaotic good
---
The hardest choice requires the strongest will.
---
I do not miss these "talking to you" memes
---
You'll have to buy him a drink first.
---
I‚Äôve been a rank 1 survivor/killer for a few months, and ‚Äòtoxicity‚Äô does really bother me anymore. If a killer face camps, then oh well, least I can do is stay on the hook while the other gens get done for the team. When a survivor brings a flashlight and teabags, let him follow you around while you chase other survivors (at least you know he isn‚Äôt doing gens). 
---
There are always counter plays if you‚Äôre concerned about toxicity. But the real thing is, don‚Äôt let everyone‚Äôs negative behavior influence you. Of cooourse you could‚Äôve made a smarter play like jerk #1 suggested, but it‚Äôs never YOUR fault they died. Tell them to get good and move on.
---
Legitimate question: is there any reason to run Premonition over Spine Chill? I feel like Spine Chill beats it in every single category.
---
Not in the first film he didn't, play the game.
---
So you blur out all of the names.. except the guy that dc'd? bruh.
---
Killer can‚Äôt chase you If you leave/hide before they get there
---
Even better when you do it back to them after they're down. Sure get a lot of üçºmessages that way.
---
Seriously, if you can't take it, don't give it.
---
"Putting a Survivor into the dying state with a BASIC ATTACK causes all generators within a 24 meter radius to instantly explode and regress."
---
Unfortunately not. It was reduced to 24 from 32 meters but it still only activates with basic attack.
---
In this state its good for M1 killers, like Myers, but many others it wouldn't be worth it to run. Hopefully its changed.
---
I think so yeah. You will have to switch targets a lot as once someone is in tier 3 you can't get points from them until they snap out of it, but it's a pretty no effort way of gaining blood points. If the survivors catch on they might let you hook them for BBQ.
---
Killers are incapable of being toxic
---
Gotcha. 
---
I've just recently come across him and haven't seen many videos. Unfortunate that he feels that way, but i'll still thank him for helpful tip videos!
---
Thanks! Usually with each survivor/killer there's a perk that wouldn't be everyone's first choice to use, but I'm glad you liked the rest!
---
No one knows
---
what the context. I watchd th Shoe
---
They were still pretty weak overall, but if you tunneled the shit out of people or used certain add-ons then there was basically nothing survivors could do to not just die
---
If they just spammed their power on one person while completely ignoring everyone else then he could down them without thinking or doing about anything, but it would take a long time
---
With the add-ons it's basically the same, except a lot quicker
---
Or there was the bug exploiting for mixing 2 specific add-ons that made mending time like 30 minutes per mend, or the other exploit of moonwalking so survivors still bled out even while getting chased.
---
Overall he was just brokenly designed, he was basically fine unless the person wanted to be a dick
---
All this coming from someone that used to love playing legion and still mains them
---
As a doctor main I find it bad I don't see him
---
I don‚Äôt mind flashlights, instaheals, or regular SWF but I don‚Äôt like annoying SWF that just all storm the hook, t-bag, and send salty messages
---
I had a game as Jake where two people went down together in the basement in the first 20 seconds. The Killer (Pig), just crouch-camped them so I went to do a gen for points. The other Survivor (Nea) saved both of them before going down, but the two Survivors both somehow failed to get out of the basement. The Pig just rehooked them and then tbagged Nea before leaving her as a slug. I stealthed past the Pig after she left and healed Nea up. The Pig slugged her again and Nea DC'ed. The hatch appeared in front of me.
---
Counting the loading screen the entire game was under four minutes long.
---
Give us daddy farmer
---
Looking awesome
---
Don't feed the troll
---
Thanks for the info and I‚Äôll be sure to remember that when I see a tbagging flashlight wielder
---
He didn't mess up for a matter of seconds, he just avoided countering the survivors the whole game. 
---
When I play survivor it is more fun to play against a good killer since the games last longer and there's more tension, i can agree that holding M1 all game is boring but that only happens with killers not doing well.
---
 In this match here he failed to pressure them, plain and simple. He didn't split pressure to stall gens. He just wandered around and when he ran into someone, chased them (more he tried to get pinky finger to proc for far too long)  The best play is to actually ignore the survivor doing nothing since they are... well doing nothing. Cycle to gens, stop their progression.
---
HybridPanda for sure.
---
That‚Äôs sad to hear, I hope I don‚Äôt get as many matches like that
---
Umbra and Jendenise
---
Here we go again meh
---
??
---
I don‚Äôt usually slug, only ever on rare occasions
---
What system are you on each one is a bit different.
---
Nice
---
Can‚Äôt forget Demi
---
You don‚Äôt have to be toxic about it lol, just politely correct them
---
I hope my games go this way, well I hope that they don‚Äôt say anything toxic I don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs just a gg or something like that
---
Devs will post an announcement when they have a date for BloodHunt.
---
Idk either
---
Absolutely! Extra Extra, Come and get these demi plays.
---
Well that sucks but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to get used to countering toxic play styles
---
Im sure you really dont want to miss a skillcheck on that gen...
---
üòÇ
---
Lol why are you getting downvoted to hell?
---
Did you mean Ron Burgendy
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
Ps4
---
Ah yes a fellow PSN foggie boi
---
Oh, really Thomas? I see it all the time
---
I‚Äôm so bored with this game, atm. However, I‚Äôm just going to grind 200k blood points a day or so, until the Stranger Things chapter.  It‚Äôs the best we can do.
---
Jendenise, Kitty Chipz, Box Ghostz, Cahlaflour. Three of them are Fog Whisperers too.
---
f13 is still good-ish it just got screwed over by legal stuff and lack of getting off the ground. I will petition that a lot of stuff from f13 like having something else to do other than gens gets added til the day DBD dies
---
Have fun, keep playing matches to get better, ignore the toxic messages YOU WILL receive and don‚Äôt let them discourage you.
---
Very nice üòä

PLAGUE?
---
Depends its about half and half I'm in purple on both sides and both get kinda salty at purple, but i dont want to say toxic because i only consider them toxic if they pm after the game or just try to be in your face all the time and those are in all ranks at times especially red ranks.
---
Why‚Äôd you hide your name, but leave the killer‚Äôs exposed?
---
*mind gets blown*

If you're bored, try:

- Playing a killer you don't play normally

- Fun/Off-Meta builds
---
- Random build generator
---
- Unlocking all the perks on your main

- Prestige a character and grind them back up

Ah shit... here we go again. Good old get good when they never saw me playig.

If you are worried, my friend, then collapse the post-game chat. There is an arrow to the far right that can close it for all matches until you click the arrow again to bring it back. 
---
If you dont want to, you dont need to hear the shit people say, just have a good time killing them.
---
Well he‚Äôs definitely not neutral evil lol
---
For what it's worth, his videos (at least the ones from back when I watched him sometimes) aren't as cancer as people made them out to be. His content could be kind of entertaining and he's pretty good at the game. He's just a dick who abuses aspects of the game that aren't intentional features, and has been banned for things like brigading/harassment (I believe? Double check this one), holding games hostage, and exploit abuse.
---
Never thought of it like that, good idea!
---
Or when you go to scratch your nose and random skill check appears out of nowhere.
---
I approve
---
Hell yes
---
Save your self
---
To each their own I suppose, but I‚Äôm not entertained by screaming and loud noises blowing out my speakers, stupid sound effects anyone can find on google, and the insufferable three stooges music. I prefer my content to be raw gameplay, not a sideshow attraction. But that‚Äôs just me.
---
Well real life deaths were made into a film and a TV series and no one batted an eyelash so I think it‚Äôs just fine.

If you get past the first season it gets actually good. First season is trash, i'll admit that much

Yeah it might work on the rank 14 spirit doing his daily but anyone with more than 3 games played on spirit is going to hear you everytime.

Daddy is not a gender, it's a state of mind, peasant

Puppers kind of hides his weird toxicity, I‚Äôd swap him with Noob. Also, Tru3 is lawful neutral
---
It's fine. He got banned twice and lied about it to get his fans to harass BHVR. So the alignment is fitting enough.
---
There,we both happy? Good.
---
Also for the record the Legion is even more horrible than Witch but yet he still made the cut.
---
Figures.
---
I'd let Frank and Joey from the Legion raw me tbh
---

---
As someone who's been playing plague, it's a "we all do or no one does". If you whole team is broken and only you cleanse you just gave plague 3 ez downs potentially, and distance hook protection on top of that. But if everyone's healthy it's almost not worth taking (especially now that 4 pools are blocked)
---
Lullaby isnt good outside of stealth killers.
---
It's just bad if they focus center screen and useless
---
Is there a reason why this is a thing?  I've seen others comment about how Bubba's tend to camp but why is that?  Asking as someone who has limited killer experience.
---
If you're like my random teammates you'll disconnect upon getting found in the locker
---
Ah I only watched the first episode but I was cringing out of my skin the entire time. Do I need to watch season 1 to understand season 2? Because I don‚Äôt think I can watch more of season 1 is was that awful. I do really enjoy The Office UK though.
---
Epic!
---
There are a couple. I personally find them uninteresting, but so are the majority of content creators.
---
LoL that rat faced Monto shouldn't be anywhere near "good". He is toxic, doesn't upload the games he gets his shit wrecked. An he cries when he gets his ass plowed for 4 gens on his discord. An worst of all he is the biggest manchild of the 6 posted.  Matter of fact Tydetime or HybridPanda should be in his "slot".
---
I know that it's a word and I'm just saying I think it sounds petty and dumb. Your reaction leads me to believe that you're not a very accepting person of other opinions though.
---
wha-
---
It might have been like that in the past but im pretty sure it goes black right after they get picked up. Idk tho this game is so buggy lmao
---
They always get my devour hope instead of ruin first
---
I wonder if clown will lick my toes like he licks fingies
---
All Neas are toxic, delete her. jk
---
Well, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.
---
Agreed. Maybe make it like stbfl were you lose a stack if you hook them in stead of them dying and you lose everything
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Seems like you made that meme on the phone (two white artifacts, old text that you tried to cover up with a brush) 
---
Couldn't you also crop it? cropping on the phone is very easy.
---
2 1/2 years. so a long time. you should read perks closer   ^_^
---
I have carpal tunnel and like... my hand hurts so bad when I have to do the wiggle thing. Why not just make it skill checks like everything else.
---
24 meters.
---
oh man, if you try to run both, people will definitely just focus on finding them. They will break them and you will end up with only 2 perks.
---
Uhh. 
---
Legion not S tier. 
---
Frank is best boy
---
They need to be inside your regular terror radius when you phasewalk for them to not hear you come out. If they are not inside your terror radius when you go in to phasewalk, they will hear you before you arrive.
---
You can use perks to change this. Run a perk that shrinks your terror radius, and then you can get closer before phasing and they shouldn't hear you coming.
---
My favourite strategy is to be chasing someone else, go in to phasewalk, and then peel off to the nearby gen. Most of the time the survivors won't expect you to change targets. Of course, this is very situational.
---
He hit the David, who then went into a dead zone... He still continued to go for the unhooked survivor.
---
When you post the same meme a couple days ago, but you get less up doots :(
---
ghostface*
---
I feel really called out and I'm not even sure why.
---
Yea, but this sub doesn't represent the entire playerbase very well
---
it use to be a 1 time use. so how long have you been playing?
---
Eyy a fellow 2016 early 2017 player? Right on fam. Decisive has gone through so many fucking changes since release i dont even know anymore lolüëå
---
Still doesn't fix the issue of needing to protect multiple totems, Sure Haunted Grounds makes it a 50/50 on if they cleanse a correct totem or Thrill to make it more difficult to but you have to protect even more totems then.
---
Can it work? yes but you need amazing RNG to pull it off
---
Also achievements
---
OP did post this to the sub though
---
I like the meme, but in shit at this game either way, so ‚ÄúI wAs JuSt FaRmInG‚Äù is one of my go tos when I get ran lmao.
---
I've always wondered how amazing and terrifying Graboids would be in this game, but obviously that would be impossible to do so it's Nothing but a silly dream.. but I never considered having any of the guys as survivors! And Burt would be amazing. I can already imagine Burt going on and on at the campfire about how much he misses his guns xD
---
I litrilly love ohtofu. Litrilly
---
WITNESS ME
---
I'm sad huntress isn't the top of the list
---
This is like the worst idea ever. 
---
By itself Huntress lullaby is dog shit. 
---
1. If you stare at your screen the audio que doesn‚Äôt matter I just pay attention and breeze through it as do most. 
---
2. Before it even has any loss of an audio que *chance* it lets literally everyone know immediately ‚ÄúHey I exist come find me when you feel like it‚Äù 
---
3. It doesn‚Äôt stop gen rush at the start at all. Ruins to stop the gens from getting 3 popped during a good first chase. Huntress won‚Äôt do that. 
---
If and I mean huge if you ever ran it run it with Overcharge any break in a gen counts for the bonus regression and overcharge kinda bread and butters this in a 3 gen strat if you get good totem placement and Pop.
---
what reaaaaally bothers me about reboot freddy is it took away how fucking hot he was, there's no sex appeal in that reboot freak but OG freddy, i could suck his dick for hours and and hours- and that's period.
---
Y'all are sleeping on Ardetha
---
Dammit now it's cute and dumb
---
that is good THAT IS GOOD
---
i love it
---
If the killer is running Lullaby, I just ignore it unless I'm playing against a doctor. It was definitely more effective against me when I was newer at the game though.
---
I don't watch other people play video games, but appreciate the meme. I've gathered enough information from this sub and the gentleman who labeled each player to understand it.
---
I once play against a Spirit with HG, DH and Ruin...guess wich totems were cleansed? Yup, none of those were HG...
---
Meg has been evading us all this time
---
Yeah if the survivors you go against are absolute potato. No good player misses skillchecks consistently. The second someone notices you have huntress, they will just prepare themselves for a skill check. It‚Äôs really not a hard perk to counter, you don‚Äôt even need to look for it. 
---
The point of ruin works both ways. If they go looking for it, they aren‚Äôt on a gen.  If they tap or hit the good skill checks, the gens are slower and the really good survivors who hit greats consistently are still slowed down slightly, not gaining the great skill check benefits. Lullaby is just so easily countered
---
I really dislike the F13 bashing on this subreddit because I will never had more fun playing any multiplayer than it. I don‚Äôt care how bad it is, no other game has had me both screaming and laughing to tears on the same night.

I have to still congratulate you for both playing your part correctly there and for the first time in a long time giving an actual example of tunneling. many people call stuff "tunneling" when it's nowhere close to that
---
I think you mean dps
---
I don‚Äôt know this guy, can you remind me to go watch his videos in a couple hours when i get home from work
---
‚ÄúwHeReS pUg‚Äù
---
Totally agree with you. I think he and Tofu have the best videos when it comes to learning the technical aspects of the game and successful strategies to win the game in either role. The whole I'm only playing this because it makes me money really soured me on him. Though I still recommend him as a technical resource for learning the game mechanics
---
I'm able to avoid chases a lot because I can tell they're on they're way towards me. I also know when I can stay on a gen because of spine chill flashing on and off letting me know someone is being chased and giving the occasional boost in repair speed. Premonition has a recharge time, and the killer can go barely into the range of it setting it off, but never actually going towards you. Once you try spine chill, you realize premonition is just trash
---
Yo that is crazy, lets hope the killer cant see that

Becauase you dont have a 315 degree useless deadzone?

Map add on
---
Ye, it's a map addon
---
Which add on is it, if you can recall? I‚Äôve never seen this before lol
---
So is Monto tho
---
Incredible work.
---
I mean you can do it if you want but don't be surprised if they DC.
---
How dare you stand in the area of half the map around the basement? Freakin' campers smh
---
People hate him because of his stupid, repetitive content, the fact he got his chat to witchhunt people, his abuse of certain bugs and the fact that he tried to solicit girls on his discord server to send him nudes.
---
Ardetha made a pretty good video giving a rundown of what happened. I‚Äôd recommend a watch.
---
This has become my life since I just ran out of energy for DbD. I'm saving shards for another Killer, XP comes from time, and with BBQ I just need one hook from each of 'em to get BP.
---
Still had a Rank 8 throw "gg ez" at my Rank 16, no-addons ass.
---
There's a lot of things they could do to make the game more accessible.  Visual heartbeat notification like on the mobile version would be super good for deaf/hard of hearing people. Colorblind mode. Get rid of the struggle/wiggle mashing. Make it skill check based like most other things. It's unnecessary and honestly painful for people with hand issues like arthritis and carpal tunnel among other things. Button remapping would be super nice to have.

You were in a 4-man. What was with the one disconnect?

Probably SWF carries.
---
out of all of the comments in this thread, this one made me actually laugh, thank you.
---
It's mostly people who are bored of going against same shit all the time.
---
Can‚Äôt be blood warden, the other 3 survivors escaped already.
---
"Tough guy"
---
Nah dude, that's a Demodog.
---
I think you dont understand me. I am not talking about how strong she is. She could be perfectly balanced and still be a prime example of bad design. In many matches you will never use half of her actual killer power. You will get people sick and then never use your M2 for the rest of the game unless you use add-ons in some matches. That is pretty much the same as a perma tier 3 Myers. If Myers was perma tier 3 by standard without add-ons then that could be boring, but its worse with plague because SHE HAS an interesting power that she rarely gets to use.
---
This looks like a well-thought out post with plenty of good advice and counterplay.
---

*^^better ^^ignore ^^it ^^all ^^sos ^^i ^^can ^^bitch ^^about ^^muh ^^iron ^^will ^^tho ^^LOL*
---
I mean, if you still enjoy playing the game then just continue to play it the way you like. Go for achievements if you want something to do and use your bloodpoints whenever they are going to max so you don't just completely waste a game.
---
I‚Äôm so glad other people know about the best boy he deserves love
---
It's misdirected. The insultingly low BP caps per game are because BVHR is salty at farmers. Since farmers get BP by investing time, as opposed to the intended game design, where you get BP by investing time.
---
JK, everyone seems to be just fine with that awful cap. No, these people aren't "happy" with the game until they're taking happiness from their opponent. A Killer OKAY with them escaping is a problem.
---
Run ds and hope u get farmed
---
God okay but if I saw a Doc Cosplay and then heard his fucking laugh I think I'd actually lose my fucking shit and panic. Somehow hearing it in real life makes it like 10 times scarier.
---
Yeah, both games are about as enjoyable as trying to nail a LEGO fig so that's fair.

HAG NEEDS HER OWN TIER ABOVE S TIER ;-;
---
Broski.
---
You're a gamer, you know that?
---
*Damn*, that was nice.
---
Yeah, but 2 minutes into the game she often has no actual "Killer Power". She only has some status effetcs that make survivors perma broken and louder.
---
I am not talking abou how strong she is at all.
---
The solo experience is the best /s. Running into multiple healthy team mates that cleanses as soon as they get the infection timer (red ranks).
---
Fourth skill check: Me and my boys
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Imo BHVR, remove the cooldown AND the sound effect. Then it is on par with spinechill, differing only on who's perspective triggers the perk.
---
Any killer that plays along with glitches deserves awards.
---
Though one time, I had that exact glitch (floating hooked Claudette), I was laughing so hard, I died really early, and apparently the killer didn't see me float around :(
---
i'ma make an argument for either Chaotic Good or Chaotic Neutral for Tofu.
---
Not only is it less likely a second one will immediately pop up, but I‚Äôve never had a case where a second one pops up right as I hit one.
---
Pull the trigger! Pull the f'n trigger!
---
It's a quality cosmetic. What can I say. Some people were excited about stranger things on Wednesday, I was excited for biker kate.
---
Oh but when I submit a post of me hovering and juking a killer it gets zero upvotes
---
I have only focused on the game and really never on the community. Why does it seems like everyone hates him 
---
Note: I‚Äôm not supporting Ochido, I‚Äôve only heard his name a few times
---
My inspiration for Spine Chill! :D
---
Tyde is a difficult one because he openly dislikes the game. At first I thought LE was spot on but I'm not so sure. He's a pretty solid streamer who has oushed for some positive changes to be mafe and doesn't indulge in toxic play from what I've seen. Maybe more of a LN.
---
Well I mean ghostface and legion may be similar in some sense but it‚Äôs ghostface he‚Äôs more iconic than legion like the same thing with bubba and billy the reason they had leatherface was because he‚Äôs so iconic it wouldn‚Äôt make sense not to
---
I love it
---
Wish I could find survivors that play along like that I literally run padded Jaws as a trapper and slap survivors once let them run away and do gens all match only to be tea-bagged at the gates or sent hateful messages at the end.
---
wait 3 man swf then who is the random girl helping you? the nurse??
---
why are you booing me im right
---
People brought up old man Myers before so it's not like there ain't some people trying. I just can't name more than these two because it's not like Michael ever truly got unique costumes every movie ala Jason.
---
Wait, Chaotic Neutral for No0b3? As in a good way I hope :D
---
how were they toxic? throughout the match or?
---
She has been trying her best to convince the entity  to switch her role
---
You get extra points for DHingover a trapped pallet while being chased, trapping the trapper in it, then following up with a pallet stun after the reset trap animation. 
---
Ok maybe not extra points, but cool points for sure.
---
He sexually harassed his underrage fans, uses everyone around him as tools to boost him , his content is just not that good anyways, and he witchhunted people he didnt like with his community. Edit: he also Popularized blendettes (p3 claudettes)
---
What a good boi
---
The man is at least honest. I can respect that.
---
It‚Äôs not 2017 anymore. If you get chased for 5 gens and are the only one who dies you‚Äôll safety pip or even actually pip in some cases.
---
I agree completely.  
---
Also, TIL this game is coming to mobile!  It will be weird if only mobile is allowed visual heartbeat notification, forcing people with hearing issues to play that version.  I wonder if they'll do the same for Switch, since it's a portable (albeit wifi dependent) platform.  
---
Also, just realized what a nightmare analog stick wiggling would be on joycons... they're gonna have to change it after a few hundred break, which might benefit us.
---
Oh shiiieeeeet
---
Duck him
---
They are both Spanish, I guess.
---
Well like lately I've been playing trapper quite a bit. I can set up some fairly tricky trap spots. But even if I get 4-6 traps it seems like I can only get to maybe half of the victims. They release themselves and disappear. 
---
I can beat most people when it comes to playing pallets on playable tiles. I'm decent at shack, jungle gyms and other common tiles. My biggest problem are these pallets where you can't do anything but break them. The survivors just throw the pallet and wait for you to break it. 
---
I don't know. I just spent the day either depipping or black pipping and it's pretty discouraging. I just want to play my favorite killers without only taking 3 chases all game.
---
Super Urban Evasion Advance
---
The issue is that his best ones are almost always blue worker overhauls that are very subtly changed. Like those are his BEST ones and while we have Rob Zombies edgy design there simply isn't a "Michael X" or "Michael goes to Hell" type of costume change. We can argue the same thing for Freddy too as his default design is just the absolute strongest thing.
---
Entity has been displeased for the last time.  "New killer enters" The Meg!!
---
Well from the video above it looks like OP is an asshole that enjoys harassing 14 year old girls.
---
Can I get an explanation
---
It's probably directed at players that play the game more than the casual players. Buying the chapter early is something more hardcore players do, I know I would if I wasn't on console.
---
Also I feel the same way. I can't wait for BL3 and if my guess is right and the DLC does drop on the 13th I'll be juggling games all day lol. There's alot of people saying it's the 17th but I'm hoping it comes sooner rather than later. I guess we'll have to see.
---
he made a video on his second channel talking about it, he said he was working on a HUGE project with loads of other people so we‚Äôll see what he comes up with
---
I actually unhooked the guy that got down and proceeded to mess with the killer
---
It doesn't waste their time, they still get a lot of blood points and a virtually free pip. I can see how it can be a bit tedious, but it almost never happens that often.
---
I have gamer's disease
---
Yeah exactly, and just like Ghostface &amp; Leatherface; Pennywise is an icon also.. so what‚Äôs so crazy about having The Clown, as well as the  licenced version (Pennywise) that it‚Äôs based off of?
---
definitely check out monto and puppers. Monto is on yt and puppers streams a whole lot. Wholesome gamers
---
I‚Äôd settle for a bloodied version of base cosmetics, I hate base David but beard David with the trench coat covered in blood (or more desirable. bloody shirtless David) would be awesome
---
Alternative win conditions were baller but busted. The worst one is always the car because you can always guarantee you make it out unless you're fighting the tele happy Jason with Boat being a VERY close second. They tried to act like Cops was amazing because EVERYONE can make it and it only requires two steps but Jason could hard camp that fuse box unlike car parts.
---
How long were you stuck like that?
---
Yeah I guess I could, thanks for letting me know that‚Äôs a possibility
---
Following. I would love to know if you make a cosplay in the future :) you're already over half there. Nice job!
---

---
I just hate waiting for such a long time to find a match
---
It would be cool to see old creepy pasta characters come into the game.
---
Thanks, I love it!
---
I also get what your saying but you also having to realize both these killers have something iconic about them like Freddy finger gloves and the thing is Freddy isn‚Äôt a huge reality warped that can take many shapes, pennywise can. Demogorgan also is one I felt could fit because well he‚Äôs never been too bad they fit most of the things that were in the show like the portals the pounces and even the mori was pretty good, pennywise feels like such a godly characters because the thing with him is, there is so many things to take account for like his true form what kind of powers he would have, his skins, all kinds of stuff because he‚Äôs practically a god.Think of it like this if they entity was in the game as a killer would they be able to fit the stuff he can do since he‚Äôs a god with seemingly nigh omnipotent power they could try but it still wouldn‚Äôt feel right it would be like thanos with infinity gauntlet being in dbd sure it would work but the amount of tasks he pulled off would seem like butter play in dbd while they have nerfed some character in dbd none of them have been godlike power, such as pennywise.

use "save the best for last" for trapper and you should also watch otzdarvas videoes of trapper analysis
---
This guy gets it
---
They are practically stickers. You don't stitch them you stick em
---
You‚Äôre acting like survivors can‚Äôt take hits and insta heal themselves. If you can‚Äôt hit great skill-checks, then you need more practice. The increase in the amount of tokens required are so I don‚Äôt get downvoted and yelled at about how my perks aren‚Äôt balanced enough. That‚Äôs the whole reason I chose to include the tokens in the first place. Exhaustion is just so it can‚Äôt be used with Sprint Burst or Dead Hard.
---
What am I watching? Is this reality?

There's umbra but she's not significant enough imo

Haha. I dont think itll be as good. I only can do woodworking and circuitry so cloth isnt my forte.

I've got plenty of ruin. Usually run enduring, BBQ, ruin +1. Usually either make your choice or spirit fury.
---
Why does this look like Nick Valentine from Fallout 4 to me?
---
Had a rank 8 bill farm me on ptb because he thought Borrowed Time isn't good anymore since it was nerfed. Yep, definitely not the best perk in the game or anything.
---
I implore you to find an example where I've said if you don't run ruin it's your fault for being gen rushed.
---
I don't like the Idea of having to run ruin every game either. but you can't fairly compare Gen rushing to Spirit. The Term "Gen Rushing" is the killer failing to apply map pressure, whether that's from spending too much time on 1 survivor, face camping, or something else. (yes i understand this is easier said than done on certain maps and with certain killers) the gens are getting rushed because YOU the killer aren't pressuring them off of them. Ruin also has several alternatives, PGTW, discordance, overcharge, surveillance, corrupt intervention, thrilling tremors, Surge, thanataphobia, etc... all with varying degrees of effectiveness but they all have a common theme of helping you slow generator progress whether that be through regressing the gen or finding/preventing survivors on the gens.
---
and no im not calling spirit overpowered, just stating that requiring you to have iron will to stand any kind of chance is not healthy for the game.
---
what alternative is their to iron will? quick and quiet? what good is fast vaulting quietly if she still hears you groaning by the window.
---
I think fiber optic lights could make very convincing sparks if they‚Äôre done right
---
So how would you suggest fixing it?? Decreasing the amount of tokens required??? Removing the exhaustion status effect????
---
I just saw Ghost Face cuming to a downed Survivor... Well now I know where I'm not gonna click next time.
---
I didn‚Äôt say you I said survivors,
---
&gt;	, just stating that requiring you to have iron will to stand any kind of chance is not healthy for the game.
---
thats the point im trying to make, you thinks its so easy to apply map pressure and chase and down survivors, but its not. the only reason nurse and spirit are considered strong is because they can end chases quickly. if you nurse or spirit to get nerfs than you should advocate for slower gens, devs would have to nerf them as they would be too strong. the root of the problem is the lack of multiple objectives and fast gens. the alternative is to learn how to mind game and counter spirit. both her and nurse have ways to play around them, sure iron will makes it easier in regards to spirit. but your goal should always be trying to have the longest chase possible. 
---
there are many ways to do this, taking advantage of busted loops, using great perks like dead hard,quick and quiet, balanced landing, spine chill, etc. you dont need calm spirit and sayjng that you can only stand a chance with that perk is just you not being as good at looping or mindgaming as you think you are, and thats fine, the longer you play the better you get. or the devs can just nerf all the strong killers and let survivors stomp every match.
---
Jane, Kate and David are typically for survivor and then Trapper maybe? And the Plague is attractive minus the disease.

You can basically choose the killer's powers when playing against plague.
---
Either A)
---
Killer has the ability to flay their mouse/joystick around wildly to damage survivors, getting hits doesn't slow the killer down like all other attacking abilities in the game. 
---
or B)
---
Killer can kill survivors in a single hit, after dedicating some time to spreading their plague. Survivors are easier to hear due to always being injured, as well as constant prolific vomiting. 
---
Like, it should be obvious which killer you would want to play against for a better chance at escaping/pipping/having fun.
---
The fact that plague barely slows down for corrupt purge means she can end chases disgustingly quick. You're going to last longer if you're forcing her to land M1s rather than vomit her way to victory.
---
I mean, can you blame the guy? Deathgarden isn't exactly the money maker he thought it would be
---
Billy you got a cigarette?
---
Yeah I getcha about it just being a video game. And it is and usually I don't really take it that seriously. But before that meant rarely even making to red ranks due to not playing much or not playing too seriously. All of this is great. 
---
But this is really the first time I'm going into red ranks and it seems completely different. Like everything I just used to crush people not a single rank ago is completely useless. Where does this difficulty spike even come from? Why is it suddenly so hard to succeed?
---
Thank you for the tips though. Couple of common sense things I should keep in mind.
---
It should have a 50ms grace period for skill checks where letting go or hitting the button does nothing, but you immediately get another skill check without it the next time you touch a gen or heal.
---
PainRelivers. Not on this chart, but he‚Äôs really good. Analyses the hell out of his gameplay.

Killers are the ones who wait 15 minutes for a game, not survivors, you enjoy wasting killers time?
---

Y'all can tell when someone hasn't been playing DbD for *that* long. 'Cause Noob3 used to be right there with Ochido; they used to play toxic with each other literally all the time.
---
Okay fair enough but your argument about needing iron will is dumb, there are alternatives the strong one being spine chill. Just like ruin isn‚Äôt the only perk agains fast gens, iron will isn‚Äôt the only one. And yes they all work better to a certain degree just like the alternatives to ruin.

---
Yeeeah...i recently played with a friend for the first time and all she did was run around and get chased on purpose.
---
I asked her why she wasn't helping with gens after 3 matches straight of me dying from trying to protect her and her response was 'i don't do gens anymore'

So yeah, i don't play with her anymore.

---
Had that with Mirror Myers once was funny to see I talked to him long enough to show him it was the addon also. my boy. use them bloodpoints
---
Honestly I don't notice much of a difference between rank 6ish or rank 1.  It's possible it was just a string of bad luck, or possibly psyching yourself out about it.  The first time or two I got to red ranks it felt so intense and like everything was so different, but I've been playing since launch and the only times I'm not red rank for survivor and killer each season is when I don't play enough.  Heck, I've had rank 15 matches harder than my average rank 1 match.  
---
There are even some pretty big RNG elements that can completely change the outcome of games aside from the survivors just being very skilled.  Having certain windows open or not, or certain pallets spawn or not can be huge.  Everyone is aware of the variance hex totems have, but even little things in the map generation/map itself can make life much harder for a killer.
---
I kind of hope he hits that stretch goal wh3re he can't quit. Jist so he has to suffer through the game.
---

You realise that it's all how business works, right? It's not like the devs are being fucked over, they get money for it. And unfortunately that's how it works
---
Good idea my dude!
---
Hag is at a serious disadvantage compared to Spirit. She needs those types of addsons just to apply proper map pressure. Meanwhile Spirit can just woosh to certain areas quickly. Hag is in need of those addons, Spirit isn't much so desperate for them.
---

How are they not alternatives to ruin?
---
What does Hex: Ruin do?
---
It slows down generator progress
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Thanataphobia, slows repair speed
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Discordance shows multiple people on a gen allowing you to pressure 2 people at once therefore slowing repair speed
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Surveillance shows you when someone interacts with a gen you kicked allowing you to find them and pressure them
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Thrilling Tremors blocks other gens and tells
---
You which gens are being worked on
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Corrupt Intervention blocks 3 gens making the survivors have to move closer to you and giving you less areas to patrol
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Pop Goes the Weasel, instantly regress gens hell this perk if used effectively is more powerful than ruin 
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Surge regresses gens
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Overcharge 
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Hex: Huntress Lullaby makes skill checks harder which in turn slows down gen progress.
---
Are they all carbon copies of ruin? No but they all affect generators in some shape or form whether it be alerting you or slowing down progress. 
---
I never said Iron will didn‚Äôt work on other killers.
---
Monto, chaotic good, is a great guy. No0b3, Neutral Evil, is pretty good in a different way.
---
Nothing it just activates my noed quicker and bitter murmer shows me all your locations
---
i know im just joking...:D When i first encountered those add ons i was totally lost...as i wasnt playing Hag at all...
---
THATS WHY survivors needs to play killers once in a while to learn them addons and what they do...

Imagine that thing rolling off the table and somehow hitting that button in the middle of the night.
---
It means that person is the obsession.
---
Downvoting for that cringy ass edit.
---
The claws means that the player is the killer's obsession
---
Never seen the obsession before? It appears over the person who is the killers obsession which is triggered by perks hence why you don't see it every game.
---
&gt; Thanataphobia, slows repair speed
---
By the absolute barest of margins.
---
&gt;Discordance shows multiple people on a gen
---
So nothing like Ruin
---
&gt;Thrilling Tremors blocks other gens and tells You which gens are being worked on
---
&gt;‚Å†Corrupt Intervention blocks 3 gens making the survivors have to move closer to you and giving you less areas to patrol
---
&gt;Pop Goes the Weasel, instantly regress gen
---
&gt;but they all affect generators in some shape or form
---
Affecting gens in some shape or form does not automatically make them alternatives to Ruin. Using that argument Quick &amp; Quiet is an alternative to Iron Will.
---
I did think about Archibald Corduroy, but, we already have spirit. Plus, Bill is the main antagonist, and has a lot more he can do then a one-off villain

The entity claws means that survivor is the killer's obsession, a mechanic tied to specific perks and addons. The killer has to play around that player in some way in order to gain some sort of benefit. How they play and whatever benefit they can get varies on a case by case basis.
---
Sometimes a survivor can run a perk that makes them the obsession and the killer has nothing to do with it. In this case it's more of a warning that a survivor may have one of those particular perks.
---
This a million times. Sometimes I just want to bite your head off after I've pounced on and hooked you a few times. 4k'ing can be just as fun as tbagging around with ghostface or pig.
---
It means that survivor is your obsession. If you are not running perks that makes one of the survivors your obsession then that survivor has something that makes them your obsession.
---
I guess so, it just would be interesting to watch a entity itself stronger than Freddy just chase a group of neas lol
---
Yassssss looking amazing
---
SUPRISE YOU WERE EXPECTING DEMOGORGAN BUT IT WAS ME

---
the no0b3 and ochiDO are really accurate

Holy shit this is so fucking dope! I really hope you share it with us when you're finished! Are you doing a full cosplay? I'd love to see it when you're done!
---
How about when you
---
 get unhooked you hit your head on the hook and become braindead for the rest of the game

Im looking forward to it
---
Haha it's still the shit, but god damn did it used to be busted. I cant believe they let all these busted perks stay like that for so long
---
when they have pinkie finger
---
He shouldn't have to man.  You should just know how bad an idea this is.
---
Jendenise is pretty big but she‚Äôs an asshole

"That's right I heard this story over and over again"

Haha what did I just watch?

Love all of these guys except Ochido, fuck Ochido

Oh shit ur right
---
Tiger interaction
---
Unbreakebill survivors:DID YOU MISS ME YOU WANKERS
---
Killer: Bitch how dare you still live!
---
Definitely, the dbd community is either one of the best or most toxic communities to play with, and majority of surv mains are utter idiots, and I play surv myself... such division within our own ranks
---
No rush to it hopefully. Just from this alone I can tell it‚Äôll come out absolutely amazing. Keep it up. I can‚Äôt wait to see more from you soon! :D
---
I didn't say it takes 35s per Gen, I said it takes about 35s to patrol them all to a point where you can hear if theya re being worked on. That is acceptable to find your targets.
---
You also sem to forget you got perks, that can help you lengthen the time it takes for gen repair, ruin is obvious but there are a lot of pers for different killers that can help you if you also use the correct addons.
---
What about when you finish the gen and so you start running only to miss a skill check?
---
I do that but I have borrowed time so I save my teammate and also save myself some time to find a pallet
---
This interaction made me smile
---
Sad noob3 noises
---
It means if you're the killer, than you're playing well
---
Still, some survivors perks are good and can be used at any ranks. Also the new map is fantastic and filled with references. And the killer is great too (it‚Äôs design, movement, power, everything).
---
Maybe, I don't know.
---
Highly un likely but its still a cool idea
---
No problem!
---
I cant believe they made generators from dead by daylight a real thing
---
The only streamer I actually try to watch. There is a soft spot for gibs too...
---
Fifth skill check: Now this is an Avengers level threat
---
Wtf dude
---
Only if you knew what he did to the Smite community.
---
You know now that I think about it his laugh sounds like a baby‚Äôs laugh but with a robot effect and a lot of drugs
---
Lol true
---
Probably 10 years old
---
Is it bad the only row I recognized everyone from was the evil row
---
Ok I know it‚Äôs his obsession... but does he get any alerts if he‚Äôs close to you or something? Because he always seems to find me when I‚Äôm the obsession
---
My 4 men swf team struggle to find ruin, if there is 2 of those we might as well just dc, I saw a spirit once with this build: ruin, haunted grounds, huntress lullaby, and noed. We lost that match, we got obliterated

what is this a crossover episode!
---
I absolutely adore this idea dude. Gravity Falls is one of the best cartoons of all time! My only problem is thinking about which looks weirder, Stan and Ford in DBD in GF style, or the normal DBD style.
---
but they make my teeth hurt and i hate going to the dentist
---
also a more fitting caption would have been
---
a locker a day keeps the doctor away since lockers counter doctor
---
still have my updoot
---
Well we have 2 chainsawers and you can make the same arguement about freddy. Your reasoning is weak.
---
IRC my main complaint when it comes to Decisive Strike which is EXACTLY what you just said is that you have to:
---
* Go down, get hooked, *and* get saved
---
* Get downed, then grabbed, within a pretty short time frame after being unhooked.
---
So apparently it DOES serve a role outside of having to get that perk.  This is of course ignoring the existence of a bunch of other perks too.
---
Considering how strangely cartoony ash looks, probably similar to that
---
EXCUSE ME BUT WHAT
---
THE SCARIEST MONSTER KNOWN TO MANKIND AND THE MOST CHILDFRIENDLY GAME HAVE A CROSSOVER
---
WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS!
---
As a chronic teabagger i take offense to this, however I try to do it in constructive ways such as to take the hit and try to buy old mate on the killers shoulder a bit of extra wiggle time üòÖ
---
Why does no0b not have a face?
---
I understand why he's running, I'd be terrified aswell. Once I've ran away from a Nea as a Michael because she followed me and I don't like being followed. I was terrified :c
---
I know it's an obvious answer but you've uninstalled and reinstalled? It does sound more like a hardware issue.
---
Sadly I've only got one slot for it, though Ochido seems the more notorious.
---
Wtf me too i posted the same picture with a similar title and it got deleted
---
i mean. it can be a strategy if someone is really good at looping to agro the killer so the other three can gen rush but that doesn‚Äôt work on a killer who knows not to let the toxic nea loop them for ten minutes, lol. silly to say you just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do gens‚Äù like what that‚Äôs the point of the game
---
Bruh I‚Äôve gotten 4 warnings for ‚Äúabusive talk‚Äù even though the other ppl r the ones cursing and saying shit, and i main survivor, I‚Äôm about to turn off messages lol
---

Chuck some blood on it and make it "aids on a stick"
---
How about a Terminator as a killer? You could call it The Machine or you know The Terminator. It would have to be the T‚Äî1000 (Aka Liquid Metal Terminator), and not the T-800 because No Guns. The killer could throw spears at survivors like The Huntress. He could also disguise himself as other killers but have none of their abilities. 
---
You could make Sarah Connor, John Connor, and an Arnold Terminator as survivors. The map could be the police station or the factory from the first movie, or the foundry at the end of the second movie. Have perks called like ‚ÄúHasta La Vista‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúCome with me‚Äù.
---
Bottom left looks like skinny Chris-Chan.
---
Fungoose is best girl
---
Only baby survivors think this is the right way to play against The Plague. Cleansing gets you a free heal, if the killer wants corruption she has to get it manually and survivors can just wait it out as it's on a timer. Any survivor who chooses to stay broken all game is an idiot, they like to think they're pros and blame everyone else when they lose but the truth is their bad decision is what got them killed.
---
Ochido js just a cunt, that‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs a bully who doesn‚Äôt let people enjoy the game and takes the piss. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôve banned all his accounts

The only thing I would change are the pants, jeans doesn't fit in that much and with something lighter you would've felt more comfortable and looked more in tone. Like old brownish pants, like she wears

Idk why whispers triggers for hooked survivors, kinda dumb if you ask me
---
I use the same add-ons mostly but I run with: BBQ, Ruin, Pop and Unnerving Presence.
---
Definitely me as a killer, just gotta switch up things.
---
Why not just handcuff the survivors hands and legs and have them all spawn in killer shack and killers spawn on the stairs with no m1 cooldown?

Thank you I also need to change the waist belt I'll keep that pants idea in mind I'm always looking for ways to improve my cosplay :)

I‚Äôve only seen his edited YouTube videos and I‚Äôm so shocked to hear that!
---
I used to play F13 back in its heyday and I absolutely loved it- it was like a /u/UltimaGabe-seeking missile because it's everything I want out of a game- but eventually I just lost interest due to the bugs, the community, and the bonkers design choices from the devs. I like DBD for different reasons, but if I had the chance to play either one at their prime I'd pick F13 every time.
---
You look super pissed lol. Like the survivors got the gate open and are teabagging at the exit. So you just stand there with your hatchet until they leave.
---
Kinda dissapointed that we dont see Sarcastikellys DBD Dwight cosplay here in "Neutral Good" feels that it could have been perfect there. she did it so good! :)

Literally ever since Spirit came out, that was when I started having serious trouble with this game as a survivor. She may be unique (not by much really, she‚Äôs kind of just an alternative nurse that can‚Äôt go THROUGH objects) but that doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs fun. 
---
Literally all you need as a spirit? Ears. And maybe Prayer Beads. No Iron Will? 
---
‚ÄúGG Ez Baby survivors‚Äù
---
The saddest part, and I know I‚Äôm gonna be downvoted to all shit if I haven‚Äôt already:
---
She takes very little skill to win. Yeah. I said it. She takes little skill to do well, and even most potato‚Äôs can 4K with her. I‚Äôve never been a huge killer player as I don‚Äôt really enjoy it. Also I‚Äôm not very good and smart enough to realize that. I have only ever been really good with one killer and that was, believe it or not, Pre-ReWork Freddy. (I dedicated hard to him and got him to rank 5 when I actually tried.) But with Spirit I found myself jumping from my average (where I at least prefer to stay because I‚Äôm usually just trying to get some extra BBQ BP or a Daily Quest) Rank 10 to Rank 4 very very quickly. And I play her like a damned potato. Yet I was able to pretty effortlessly steam roll almost every team I went against and it did not take long. I was so baffled and disgusted I didn‚Äôt play Killer again until reset. Most of my wins felt cheap and undeserved. I feel like she has little counterplay in most situations, and at just Purple Ranks I tend to fear Spirits more than P3 Rank 1 Nurse‚Äôs.
---
See that little magnifying glass at the top of your screen? Try clicking on it.
---
Plot twist: IT is the entity.  He has been in the game all along. Time for him to make an appearance.
---
It really does. Especially early game if you play enough killer, based on where you spawn, you can get a pretty good idea of where the killer spawned. If you run bond, you can see who's getting chased which helps with direction later in the game if you're not found first

See, cool as these are, I wish these plays weren‚Äôt always possible. I don‚Äôt like that you‚Äôre heavily encouraged to go *towards* the killer rather than *away*. I‚Äôd suggest something but most I can think is just remove flashlights, which I don‚Äôt even think is a good idea
---
I mean are you telling them to not use their power?

Many didn‚Äôt think Freddy‚Äôs or the Demogorgon‚Äôs would either.. but will you look at that! - the devs made it happen by nicely intertwining them into the game, and they work and have been accepted just fine, despite the clear nerfs in comparison so the actual character‚Äôs abilities in the films/show
---
Many times, that's why I stopped playing the PTB.
---
Watch a video and then decide. Despite what shit he did or said, he was beasty at dbd, flashlight saves all day. He had fun destroying killers.
---
Did you forget that spine chill exists?
---
&gt;Im playing Freddy

Freddy is everything but bad lol

"Jon why are you here?". "an hearth attack, stupid fucking ghost face
---
Play on console. Had a guy who I killed pretty early-game message me immediately saying "gg ez"
---
Didn‚Äôt see how that was possible, so I responded "lol same"
---
Didn‚Äôt get any of the other three survivors, but somehow they were much more cordial in their "GG" messages.
---
He also streams on Twitch if you want to ask him something about DBD, even though he has over 1-2k viewers he's trying to answer as much as he can. Also seeing him playing live helps a lot too.
---
So what I'm basically trying to say is that, this is a bad perk that does literally nothing to help you, puts you in danger even more actually. If you want to know when you are in danger the heart beat is a damn thing. And spine chill can also help you know if the killer is coming to you.
---
I feel like demi should be here

I started playing Trapper as my main only thanks to him.

#GUH GUH GUH _SQUEEEEEAL_
---
Please stop

See, no, I finish with however I'm chasing
---
Having Bamboozle be a requirement to deal with the 2016 god windows isn‚Äôt healthy for the game either but it‚Äôs funny how all the ‚Äúnerf spirit‚Äù people don‚Äùt have an issue with that.
---
Look dude nobody wants to use the low-mid tier killers. Most of them can‚Äôt do shit because the majority of pallets in the game are safe pallets. The survivor can see you at all times and as long as they stay on the other side the killer can never get a hit. It takes little skill. So many killers are just forced to be run around by these survivors praying they make a mistake.
---
Spirit puts the game back in the killers hands. Rather than the killer hoping the survivor makes mistakes, it is now the survivor hoping the killer makes mistakes. Funny how so many people stomp their feet and cry over that.
---
I play survivor too and spirit can be strong but I dont fault anyone for not wanting to play LF, Doc, Myers, Wraith etc
---
yes but pennywise feeds off kids fear, kids. not adults

ohw

BUT IT'S STILL  A CLOWN! those are number 1 scariest thing number 2 is spiders
---
Leatherface is one of the worst killers. His only strong suit however is camping since he can take out multiple targets using his chainsaw, hence why many bubbas camp
---
oh he had a ton of fun alright
---
Because otherwise noone would buy them. At least, when someone DC's at the start of the match after a splinter was burned, you can play that character WITH his perks. It'll show up as you'd have bought the killer, you can even buy bloodweb perks/items.
---
You can try this in PTB, as splinters don't work at the moment. Use a splinter, it won't work. At the end of the match, you'll be able to start a new game in the lobby with the splinter killer. But don't change the killer, because it'll disappear from your killer list.
---
What about Not Otzdarva?
---
Wrong. Pennywise PREFERS children over adults, simply because it‚Äôs easier to scare and manipulate them
---
I absolutely love doing that kind of stuff.  Im pretty much always respectful, but if I play like absolute shit, Ill drop a ggez on occasion, or if I do a stupid play Ill T-bag, or hit a pallet/whif a dead hard as killer Ill nod.  
---
Just fun little things bc Im dumb :D
---
I think it refers to a sound queue that the survivors get, but I'm not really sure. I don't actually know what sound effect they are talking about.
---
survivor queues on pc are 5 seconds to 2 minutes on pc from rank 20-1
---
You brought this upon yourself
---
\+1
---
Then don't overthink it. I get "tunneler" comments from time to time, but I know that's not my style, so these comments doesn't bother me. Just shrug it off.
---
Ying best waifu
---
I love how Otz is positive most of the time even though survivors are teabagging and other shit he even gives them free hatch or escape.
---
However when survivors are actual assholes and they manage to piss off even Otz, you know shit just got real. Angry Otz is scary.
---
It took me all summer to really learn the game. I'm just saying though, everyone is toxic, some may not be as bad as others, but everyone has the toxicity in them.
---
I think it just irks me because then I feel bad for even playing
---
See if you can get a big ol fucking subwoofer jammed in there.
---
What about daddy Myers? I mean he'll choke you real good ;)
---
God i wish dbd had merch like this, awesome creation guy
---
I wouldn't consider him neutral good. He's like the neutral evil because of him being so pissy about survivors because less effort and all that and how looping is easy.
---
We must have daddy farmer. 
---
Gamers, rise up!
---
They really are a part of the dbd culture

Most ppl who play games and are streaming are usually that lol. Self declares positive. Plays games and gets super salty.

I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad. I didn‚Äôt have any difficulty reading

Some times i just hit a random bush and i get a injerd claudette for some reson.
---
His content is generally repetitive and unfunny, with him just putting on a stupid voice and going around saying stupid shit. He's also pretty toxic in how he plays the game.
---
A year back when he was one of the big dbd youtubers, his fans were really braindead, and constantly went P3 Claudette's that constantly teabagged and were really toxic (they'd usually name themself FILTHY CREATURE or something like that), trying to copy how OchiDO did it in his videos. Added onto the fact that the game was heavily balanced towards the survivors side, this was really hurting the quality/ toxicity of the game, as OchiDO fans were very common.
---
There was also a youtuber that called him out for sexually harassing his fans and letting them be in his videos if they were girls, but would usually harass them and ask them for nudes n shit, if they said no he'd witch hunt  the girls on stream. One of the girls he was harrassing was an underage girl. He apologized for this but deleted the apology right after.
---
it will really screw Ghostface tho
---
You were
---
We got a bunch of these with my bf too! We have the scoops ahoy Steve one, Nancy, Eleven with eggos, Jonathan and a scene with babysitter Steve facing the demogorgon. Didn't find a final place for them yet in the PC room, otherwise I'd take a picture.
---
It's a bit exaggerated imo you can do good with low tier killers in high ranks but it's a higher likely hood the survivors know how to counter you better while Nurse, Billy and spirit counters end up being more leaned to the killers own skills especially with nurse 
---
But someone like wraith that's a M1 killer is going to get bullied at higher ranks bc of the fact all you have is M1
---
At least he admitted it. Some ppl get alot of money and still want more and doesnt appreciate the amount of money they get.
---
Thats really dumb.
---
You‚Äôre not catching anyone
---
Its because the developers of left for dead stopped making games for valve and are making their own game i think.
---
If you're having trouble avoiding the killer try running spine chill, it's a great perk and will help you get a feel of the terror radius
---
Except you can hit survivors while you cant get passed a killer bodyblocking a basement. Get your bias outta here.
---
So true, especially with BBQ when those morons don't realize I'm using it.
---
My pp gets hard everytime he says key moment

You can play low tier killers in high ranks but you're going to struggle, especially with swf. Personally I just say fuck it and I play trapper all the time. He's just too fun for me to give up and I don't want to be forced to play spirit Billy etc all the time
---
Monto as good? He is a quality streamer but he has lots of content they seems to be aimed as bringing negativity amongst the community (toxic gameplay). I'd have Tru and him swap spots but it's all debatable.

Criticism is allowed right?Well here are the problems I saw:Night Ominence(seond perk)should be an add-on,seeing as it directly interacts with bill's power,and his cartooniness will be hard to transfer into dbd without ruining the fact that it's a horror game,otherwise, great job
---
I don‚Äôt know, but now I‚Äôm paranoid as fuck
---
Been a fan of the whole series, i still somewhat understand where your getting at and respect your opinion about the game. There's people who genuinely enjoy it and everyone can like/dislike a game based on their own experience.
---
Give me my Panda!
---
Where‚Äôs Demi?????
---
You know an interesting idea I once heard was that it would allow u to open the hatch if the killer closed it . I‚Äôm not sure what if that would be a good buff but thought it was worth posting
---
Lol yeah that Kobe on Autohaven
---
And they say you can't hear images.
---
Unironically, you fatness fits so well with the Huntress aesthetic!
---
You are going to survive winter somehow.
---
Easily? This wasn't easy. It required incredible skill at using the Flashlight (which, as a new player, I can't do worth a damn), as well as using the environment to the perfect advantage. If the killer hadn't walked into a pallet this whole thing would have been basically pointless. And if the killer were as skilled as that survivor, he could have easily slashed the survivor, and once he drops off the captive on a hook then it's feeding time.
---
You're watching an absolute master of their craft showing off their best piece and saying, "This shouldn't be allowed!" For the other 99.9999% of players, this situation would have been terrifying.
---
Thats how I started with my survivor and im currently Rank 10 and usually the last to be hooked. You can dissappear hella fast. Also you run Lithe if you want to focus more on hook saves and Urban Evasion if you want to be the gen/totem person
---
Otz is a lawful good but his chat (including me) is loudly chaotic evil. Any time he asks if he should be merciful we demand blood.
---
You might like it. In many ways it's a finale to everything that's happened before, but also a retread - so it will make sense by itself if you're at least vaguely aware of SU, but at the same time will spoil the preceding 5 seasons if you intend to watch them at any point. 
---
It's also a complete musical, if that helps.
---
You'll be fine bro
---
That looks so awesome. You look great. Did it take you long to make it?
---
But Premonition is the one nobody uses.  Spine Chill is a very popular perk.
---
This reminds me of that new meme format
---
Both Resilience and Spine Chill speed up vault interactions on both windows and pallets.
---
They added a demogorgon to Fortnite too
---
Anything's a dildo if you're brave enough- James T Kirk.
---
wrong streamer. It's Tru3 in CN
---
The best part about this DLC is that the killer is actually scary for once.
---
;)
---
Imagine still being mad at Claud in 2k19
---
Just play on Low settings or increase your brightness
---
:)
---
Gotta stop eating apples to face weaker killers
---
gotcha
---
I have that issue too. Spine Chill helps SO MUCH.
---
Thanks guys!

G00d
---
Agreed. Claudette is the only survivorna can occasionally miss when she sits in the grass or suddenly crouches in corner midchase.
---
Devs should do something about this, as playing on lower graphics or increasing brightness barely helps
---
The disrespect is real
---
Yes it does. Just not in the description of the perk
---
stupid fucking clown  **ü§°**  **ü§°**  **ü§°**
---
You give em the hatch then you just wait in the endgame chat but either only get a gg or no response at all
---
Make her Albino
---
Hi Taco bell yes are you hiring today? Oh great I will be down and fill up an application. Thank you.
---
Jen: Obnoxious Evil
---
You deserve it for using pink Nea.
---
Is this a common glitch/Bug or is this a hacker that bypassed it maybe
---
Got called a "walking camper" today for rocking a 3 -gen strat with the Plague when I funnelled the Survivors into leaving the last 3 gens absolutely surrounded by hooks and fairly easy to patrol/vomtrack. Ended up killing all of them but it took ages.
---
They really will complain about anything.
---
must be a tapp main
---
Too easy
---
Pallet Stun Pig
---
That's all I have to say

It's been 5 hours now watch him

Yellow mori on prestige 3 nurse. Blinks once.

"Brutal Killer"
---
You have to love these type of killers
---
got to watch out for that kelpo
---
Kinda I mostly edited items to make the fit I'm teaching myself to sew and pushing my self to get better
---
You'll get a lot better at things by watching others do it.
---
Van we talk about the anonymous tab in your phone?
---
Why? He is shit anyways.
---
My favorite that I do VERY RARELY is use blood warden and kill them all MUHAHAHAHA!  But I‚Äôm generally a nice killer who gives hatch if a game went particularly poorly for the survivors.
---
And I OOP-
---
You spelt pedo wrong on the last one
---
I wish you could actually cancel picking up at 1/3.
---
glitch, some actions are currently able to overwrite the ds animation, thus denying its use
---
The totem perk is good, but you'd need to remove the aura reading. It's way too strong, unless they rework totem perks. Other than that very good.
---
Oh wow. Me and my teammate on the gen both had DS so we banked on her pulling us off to force it but it glitching out fucked over both of us
---
Well it looks awesome
---
Yes, that is how it horks
---
Can't wait for these to be in the Walmart Toy Aisle next to the Piggy and Bunny masks.
---
unfortunately, it does
---
Thank you I'm working on making it even better
---
I'm telling you though, it doesnt. I just had a game earlier where I had no issue spotting him through my own head. Maybe you're having a tech issue of some kind? Or just good old fashioned lag?
---
I just think its stupid spine chill detects stealth killers like wraith and pig and even the spirit when she is phasing. 
---
Yes I know you can see the pig clear as daylight when she is crouching and the bing bong is very visable even when cloaked.
---
My main issue with it is how powerful it is in mindgaming the killer. You literally dont even have to look at them to know exactly where they are based purely on sound and the icon lighting up. 
---
Afaik the only thing it doesnt detect is tier 1 myers and on ptb freddy/demo. Absolutely ruins stealth killers which further enforces the Nurse/Billy metagame
---
They could make easy money by making it actual DLC though. A dollar a pack, maybe, or maybe $2.99. I'd totally pay a few bucks for some of these packs.
---
This is dbd where there are at least 100 bugs for anything
---
You‚Äôre not lying
---
Yeah it'd be just as good if the aura was removed. Probably could just bring a map if you're having trouble finding them.
---
I didn't watch the video I just when with the usual response I see xD
---
Or small game/detectives hunch. Your idea would just kill those perks, as no one really uses DetHunch for anything but totems.
---
I usually never run ds, as i fear missing the skillcheck and that it also gets denied by some stupid bug
---
Snatched
---
Honestly give them something else to do, please. Why hasn't there been another objective for the survivors other than "gen rush, sit in exit gates and tbag"?
---
Because running solo que without self care is asking for a bad time. What good is bond when your teammates are headless chickens? I've 1800hrs, I've replaced self care multiple times and keep coming back to it. Why? Because relying on your teammates is ASKING for a bad time in DBD. Anyone saying otherwise has not played enough of the game or they just play swf.
---
That's true. It's great you're offering some advice on these. I also wanted to to hear some feedback on these since there's always room for some adjustments with these for balancing sake.
---
Why not both?
---
I just grind with different killers and pour the BPS into the killer I want
---
so you're saying that you can reveal him by walking 3m away from him? 
---
no, i don't have any of these issues, it's just how his revealing mechanic works + GF's shroud it's so bugged that sometimes you can reveal him by just looking randomly around you without knowing he's there
---
you can watch a lot of clips all over the yt to see how stupid is to reveal him
---
10/10
---
As a killer I enjoy when my survivors don't heal and just run around grunting and moaning. It makes tracking so easy.
---
Yeah, they're really good ideas that kind of fit with the roles they usually have for DLC. One bandaid perk that fixes an issue that they didnt want to add to base game, one exhaustion perk, and one niche perk. This feels like it could be real, nothing too crazy or stupid. Excited to see what other ideas you come up with :)
---
Not if they 'fry' your router.
---
Agreed.
---
He harassed minors, asked them for nudes, blackmailed girls for his streamings, insult them when he didn't get what he wanted. He stealed content of fans and didn't credit them. His way of playing is toxic, he has been banned four fucking times. It is known that he plays on low rank on purpose for the videos (wow so good playing with a rank 20 when you are rank 1), he just repeat the same old jokes over and over, and scream stupid things with that fake accent. He is creepy and not funny. Now he just do comps of plays from other people and adds the same fucking sound effects every time. 
---
You like him? Ok, this is just my opinion about the videos. But the harassment is real, so that made him a piece of shit anyway.
---
It's gotta be the doctor. All the killers sounds scary, but a guy who sends you literally insane by being near him is a big no no.
---
I couldn't because entity wouldn't allow me to. But i assert my dominance early in the game.
---
The thing about lower ranks is that your teamates aren't very good. They probably start the game hiding and not doing a Gen. I suggest getting a survive with friends and learning how to loop so that the killer gives up on you. Spine chill will also help, but there is no point in it if no one is doing generators
---
Once you get to I'd say rank 13 it will stop.
---
Not really, it depends on the context
---
No one cares, he's a good guy
---
Probably Wraith, because without a 3rd person veiw he's terrifying
---
All I hear is Yes, you pervy bastard! I love you!
---
Funny concept you have about being good
---
I think it suits her
---
The part about tryharding is right but I believe that dark claudettes can be used by players that are not very good at stealth to hide better as some kind of easy mode. But yeah at red ranks it gets really annoying
---
Yours too
---
"Guys, the bargain bin Ruin that doesn't even start doing anything until you've got three hooks is TOTALLY better than actual Ruin, trust me"
---
I already feel uneasy when I play against michael myers in game so I guess him
---
And even if you are doing this; don't let OP SWFs complain about anything when they can literally get the generators done in no time at all with anything that remotely resembles competency
---
My rule is that if I don't get a hit or a pallet off of a survivor in 15secs of a chase I change to another target. The biggest gripe I have with killers is that they don't know when to break a chase and go for a new target. I would only consider tunneling when I chase a person who has just been unhooked. When I play survivor I don't like being tunneled off the hook so I don't do it to others. Just play how you feel for now, as you learn the game more you'll develop your own style of playing.
---
Awww lil baby upset :(((
---
Otz is so fucking good
---
im a red ranks in ps4 whit hag and billy and i recently started playing the game in the pc ... i made the mistake to play pig from the start and after a couple of  games i always almost in purples when my younger sister told me " hei bro can i try playing killer now that you have a new account ... ups " 
---
So i started working on losing ranks  but i dident want to just dc  or afk in a courner so i just run around whit random killers whit one perk ... and OMG do i get a lot of GG Easy or baby "$¬£%¬£$
---
I cant belive the flame i get from ppl that think that the just outplayed me  not noticing me sluging them 4 picking them up let them get off so the get back up or letting them do generators etc etc 
---
i did 12 games and im back to lvl 14 and its harder to lose pips that you can imagine.
---
He's a toxic survivor. There is a perk that makes it so after you get unhooked, you have a minute to get picked up and then stab the killer and be let free. To counter this, leave them on the ground for a bit. 
---
Also I suggest hitting the unhooker once before you go and finish the kill(if they are close). They will have to heal which means they aren't doing generators.
---
Zubat most underrated
---
Bricky too, even though he doesn‚Äôt focus on dbd
---
They wouldn't fit in the game.
---
Hillybilly because a guy coming at you full speed with a chainsaw multiple times and feeling it tear into your back multiple times would be horrible.
---
the demogorgon, but if we say already in the game i guess myers, as for the killers made by BHVR i say billy because that chainsaw would be devastating and really loud
---
Is it just me or is the Evil row filled with survivor mains? So what does that say about survivors compared to killers?
---
It's not that long. 8 minutes max
---
I'm sorry I'm still fairly new what is p3?
---
Make your choice would be a good substitution
---
That's fucking cool!!
---
I'm a killer main and I don't see anything wrong with this
---
Monto streams too nowadays :)
---
Unfortunately Trapper is, in my opinion, the worst killer in the game. To play him effectively you need to take time to place traps throughout the map. In red ranks, however, you don‚Äôt have enough time to do this without the survivors getting a significant amount of gen progress. I have caught myself getting stuck just playing man with machete with him because I feel like I can‚Äôt get my traps down without throwing the game.
---
Here's a RIP for your Purple Flashlight
---
Proof?
---
It's spine chill I bet
---
*slash*
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaa
---
I thought your rank was not effected when a killer DCs
---
Oof, someone did that to me on my second time playing killer, first time trapper, second the wraith. The guy at the end said I was joke. I was only rank 18 with no addons or enough perks to even put up a decent match :( 
---
This guy was like a rank 11.
---
I'm live in Asia, takes me forever to find a survivor fame, but takes me less than a minute to find a killer game ( around rank 5 for both)
---
One day I will be on that chart of great people.
---
I feel like you're talking up OPs skill a bit much...all he did was get adrenaline and flashlight an immobile killer? There wasn't much skill shown in this clip, especially not from the killer who just walked through a pallet knowing damn well that a hungry altruist was following them. If OP was as amazing as you think he is, he would of succeeded with the first blind.
---
youre gonna get tunneled and moried on sight if u play p3 claudette. nah but for real, i think you should just continue with prestiging dwight since u already started
---
I'm not disagreeing or agreeing bc I never tried it but maybe you try it and see
---
Grind Blood Points so when new web changes come out
---
All of his content is fun to watch, he's very informative, chill, not toxic, and has fun playing the games he does.
---
He is the perfect model example of a communitys cornerstone.
---
That being said, i fuckin' love Otz and he belongs in the holy trinity of streamers alongside [Local streamer dies to pinwheel] and [JUST A LIL' BIT]
---
Honestly though some DBD mercy like this would make a killing
---
^sorry
---
Prestige 3 means they got that character to level 50 3 times
---
When you try to eat or drink also, happens to me all the time
---
Repost :/
---
I wish to be too.
---
~~Follow me on Twitch~~
---
Then there‚Äôs me, a bad killer who gets bullied because the matchmaking is terrible (I‚Äôm rank 14 and get put against red ranks often)
---
Love him and his voice lines, he's so cute!
---
Yea so you run away. It's the same thing. Just stop making chapter ideas all of them are trash
---
thanks, pretty much . \_.
---
Looks like a regular lag spike tbh, could be that you uncapped your FPS as the game is not exactly optimised for that but more than likely it's your connection, are you on a powerline adapter?
---
He walked right into that one lol
---
I'm meant not to reply to someone that keeps calling me selfish? But yeah, I guess I felt for that.
---
This is great
---
Get tunneled by the spirit because you are the easiest survivor to track -&gt; die -&gt; pray that you won't match up against a spirit -&gt; repeat
---
Thats what i've been saying but literally EVERYONE on here tells me its not a thing that happens so i decided to record it.
---
The plague
---
That is preposterous.
---
When I find a "nice killer" I just do the gens as quickly as possible and open the gate. No farming on my watch and I want to find an actual game asap.
---
Stop wasting my and everyone's time.
---
my connection is fine, the lag is caused by the killers connection, i havent lagged in any game in 2 years and its only with high ping killers.
---
Daddy Michael, Frank, and Trapper for me
---
Mostly I just wonder why they hate points.
---
Or I'm laughing at them because it's clear that they were trying to save their item, but I am almost always running Franklin's hag =P
---
noob3 haunt the main killers in their dreams...
---
It sounded like you got a skill he k for repair as she grabbed you which in turn may have over written the ds skill check not sure if that happens though this is very situational
---
Hey that rock is amazing! Wouldn't want anything else with me when it's a 1v1 with me and the killer. I throw rock, killer chase sound, I hop through the hatch screaming "You got bamboozled!"
---
If you like Claudette then you should prestige her. You shouldn't feel committed to something because you've progressed on a different survivor more. Just follow your unconscious, if it feels right go for it.
---
what? People tell you lags dont happen?
---
Well. In ‚Ç¨ its 8‚Ç¨ for a chapter and 5‚Ç¨ for standalone licensed.
---
This is the best piece of cosplay material I‚Äôve ever seen. I need you to fully understand I would pa some very good money for one of these.
---
She has a passive ability if you give her dark clothes you can't see her if its dark
---
nah not really. p3 claudettes are pretty much the most hated
---
No0b is the best out of all of them
---
I second this
---
See that's the problem because dbd doesn't really have an issue with connection untill about 200 ping and upwards so I don't see why out of everyone YOU would be the only one affected
---
If you're going to rip someone's meme be a good thief and wait at least a year.
---
actually yknow what? ur right. prestige claudette if u like her more op
---
I mean, if you have a gaming mouse that let's you set a macro on it... just set a struggle macro. As a killer main I see a lot of survivors immediately start having seizures when put into dying, so I'm pretty sure wiggle and struggle macros arent that uncommon in the community
---
the scariest thing about the skin is that the entire head has a heat signature, meaning it's not a costume.
---
I love how you're getting downvoted for literally wanting to play the game normally. God I hate this community
---
I am sorry
---
Ochido is hot tho
---
It is

Was human. Turned into a demon that can do just about the same things as Pennywise as long as his victims are asleep.

I've had that happen to me and spent like a minute still trying to hook them
---
Bro, his ghost face assassin's Creed kill is the best thing ever.
---
What rank? I don't care about how good it bad. Just don't want the bad matchmaking
---
Actually i aim for p3 meg. I don‚Äôt want some meg sbing away at light speed and vanishing the second they mess up a generator.

Otzda best boy

should've 99'd tier 2 and smacked em at the gate

I do use a macro, but it seems ridiculous to me that I had to use it in the first place. It is the first time in my gaming experience when a godawful game mechanic forces me to use a macro.
---
Let me know if y'all have any criticisms!
---
You mean i‚Äôm not the most hated?

Shit, I gotta step it up and work harder, I don‚Äôt want claudette to steal my spot

More satisfying than toxic.
---
-Verified Killer Main
---
I would be: 
---
Legitimately scared: Pig, Legion, Ghost Face, Shape, Clown, Huntress, Trapper
---
Would probably be on the brink of passing out: Hag, Wraith, Cannibal, Hillbilly, Nightmare 
---
Would shit myself: Nurse, Spirit, Plague, Doctor
---
Set the button to mouse wheel down
---
&gt; that just sounds like baby survivor talk
---
The last "tunneler" comment on my profile is by someone with 1400+ hours. So... not exactly baby talk, no.
---
Before I get my 4th BBQ stack I almost never chase previously hooked survivors. After that it's an open season.
---
If that Huntress didn‚Äôt throw that hatchet you would have died
---
We already have a clown
---
Also I want an original killer next plz
---
Isn't Maximum Penetration just Dead Hard? Overall I do like these perks!
---
When you preffer to eat the survivors that actually hook them until they die
---
I like Rochelle‚Äôs hair with the red - purple sweater

Cap it and adjust a few settings to troubleshoot. Maybe make your PC hardwired to your router to test further.

yeah, like how leatherface aint on mobile so (im guessing) his perks are general perks now
---
You would be surprised how people enjoy watching "dicks"

Just watching his gameplay has taught me alot about playing killer. I already had patrols and breaking off chases before they got too long but I learned so many mindgames after watching him play like Moonwalking and slapping through a pallet.
---
What about Hybrid Panda ?
---
I'm glad there's more posts about getting bans. It shows that at least to a certain degree something is being done about whatever banned people are trying to hide.
---
Can you spell?
---
Only for 5 minutes :(
---
Yh destroying "baby" killers, sick gameplay with full swf lmao
---
Calling people clowns makes you sound smart
---
My connection really wasn't, most of my games everyone has green ping but every 3rd game or so i get a SWF or a 2 stack and they have 200ms, So its their responsibility weather there going to ext out and wait 10s for another game with a killer closer to there home or blame me for something i cant control, usually post game i ask where there from and they something stupid far away from my home, so no i dont think its my responsibility to make sure the survivors have a good connection because we live on different sides of the world making me wait another 5-10 minutes for a game.
---
Not throw pallets down? I don't think most survivor mains are going to just stop using the main defense they have, unless they're like, challenging themselves for one game or something.
---
Being unable to play is missing enough.
---
I getchu I don't have a problem with spirit fury but like survivors do kinda have to pull pallets at some point lol
---
Clown would probably like the sound of fingers snapping.
---
I use spine chill and has saved my ass so many times...would recommend!
---
Nah, I'm just not liquid enough because I'm the designated shopper out  of my roomates.

Ill add you when i get home i just got off work

---
Bans happen all the time. We don't see posts about it more often because OPs get immediately attacked when they make a thread.
---
I live with roommates, not in my mom's basement.
---
What happened? Need infos and don't want to watch 500 10 min videos
---
Nice B8
---
excuse me? Have i read this wrong or are you accusing me of actually doing some against the rules?
---
Lolol Demogorgon screeching and running away had me rolling.
---
He's also done at least two trapper analysis videos where he watches another person's game and gives commentary. It's really interesting and trapper seems like, or Otz is so good he makes it look like, he has a high skill ceiling.
---
I doubt that is the reason the devs just do not ban just cause of reports they look at the case so you could have got banned another way you just do not remember
---
Well me saying he's greedy was just a guess on my end for why people are disliking him for. Why else would people hate him for that?  For me I say good for him, but just thought him being honest just brings up problems like OP placing him on lawful evil, and others hating on him for just wanting to live. Sometimes being honest is not worth the trouble, especially if the troubles shouldn't even happen at all for just wanting to live a good life.
---
I mean he's the kinda guy who doesnt take the game seriously and just wants to have fun doing dumb stuff. At least I can say his videos are different
---
Also, i main adam.. His perks are amazing, i use deliverance pebble, and 3 randoms for the other 2
---
I was just trying to make your life easier with a tip I use, not trying to start an internet war.  Sorry.
---
All the money I have I either spend on food and/or put away to buy better equipment for my job, I rarely have any for my own uses, excluding gas money that is.

I CANT STOP LAUGHING HAHAHH

If it makes you feel better,  I  have ~55 perks with Huntress, most of them T3 - none of which are BBQ.
---
No it doesn't, it makes me a clown too...
---
But maybe I want to be a clown ü§°ü§°
---
Oh thank you for clarifying and if you read the thread it is happening

I think it has something to do with her pose like is she trying to T-pose or something?

So you're griping about a problem you've already solved...?
---
Idk if u do this but if I dont get bbq on a killer I just play on a killer that I do have bbq
---
Holy shit my man, cool, not ganna lie tho I would want Dipped and Mabel in the game tho haha, even if they have to make them basically teenagers, now THAT would convert me to a survivor main

Usually rude people aren't that bright either, TangoMango517.

Demi is beyond concepts such as good and evil.
---
When you blindly vaulted the window the first time she was already running with her pounce ability. Then she tried it again lol.
---
Yeah, only legends do that.  It takes a true master to rely on perks that aren't good anywhere but against noob killers.
---
Skrrrrrrr
---
Bad connection. Don't worry, dedicated servers are coming.
---
What about Plague? She can also hit multiple targets to hinder them in one way or another.
---
I never understood his "hype" or popularity
---
Spine chill isn't overrated almost every match that I go I see at least one or two spine chill
---
It's simple.  Whenever a person is a legend at the game (and can, using crutch perks and a swf, take down a rank 20 killer) people flock to them.
---
HOLY SHIT I FORGOT ITS IN FUCKIN 4 DAYS
---
Its easy all the way until rank 4

r/punpolice, passing through.  I rate your pun a solid 9/10, you are good to go.
---
Crazy because I enjoy playing all three but every time I found out we're playing the doctor is because I hear a scream and one or two disconnects
---
You got baited bro
---
Thanks for sharing :)
---
No way I love it when that happens.
---
Disappointing but not surprising :/
---
Well since you shouldn't have still had it anyway, it worked out
---
Possibly four...
---
Well, the Demogorgon *is* an animal. Animals tend to make loud noises when excited.
---
But it was so tasty, I had to take it
---
Yes. Yes you did. üëè
---
No mercy, let the babies learn
---
I snorted too
---
I would make him completely invisible. Only audible.
---
Awesome!

We will post the image this weekend!

Thank you!

Zubat is just neutral. He's on another plane of emotion that we can't even see it.

Epic Games. Epic Games were. They‚Äôre banking on the fact that IT has become mainstream, thus becoming popular among children. They don‚Äôt care about the adults. They wanna have children point at it and say ‚ÄúOh, look! It‚Äôs Pennywise!‚Äù
---
*Sad gassy boi noises*
---
it's perfect
---
Yes, you can just throw them early.
---
There's still a potential 4 hits a match where it is a complete surprise.
---
It's pretty fucking high tier on any M1 killer.
---
If you have an issue with the rules, modmail is open.
---
I have doctor's weapon too I stole it from a baseball field
---
Say sike right now
---
Yes possibly four but three at the minimum.
---
The Demogorgon looks so cute with his head shake. Lol
---
I think burgundy carnation, wild indigo and frosh week warfare are p cute but she‚Äôs v limited compared to the other characters
---
No love for usyliss
---
I loved how aggressive it was.
---
The whole interaction killed me. Lol
---
Claudettes arent the problem. Blendettes are problem
---
I like these moments. Goes to show that behind the big scary killer is a real person just wanting to play some Dead by Daylight. It took me a long time to see this as strange as it sounds; I was always so immersed in the horrors of this game which made me feel dread in the presence of the killer. Seeing them not as the 'killer' and instead as another player, has definitely made me ease up a little.
---
His forehead is the only light in my life
---
It still annoys to this day that there's so many players that don't seem to notice that the killer isn't trying to kill them lol
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I've been accused of it too, but my wifi is spotty (working on fixing that). I see survivors that stay in the lobby while I'm watching their ping bars go up past 250 and beyond. Honestly, if your ping is going into the red and you decide you want to stay in the lobby and get into the match then....well, that part isn't really my fault when they could have left and tried for better ping.
---
I don't think it has as much to do with your actual computer/specs as it does with your internet.
---
Spirit fury isn't high tier? 
---
Tell that to....well...everyone honestly. Spirit fury is pretty high tier.
---
True facts
---
Omg I wish I had these experiences... unfortunately I'm always red ranks so I'm always facing tryhards. I'm gonna start de-pipping on porpous to have those games XD
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
Cool thanks
---
I‚Äôm sneaky without it, ;) can‚Äôt make it too easy.
---
If you‚Äôre not bringing any hexes then don‚Äôt bring thrill of the hunt. Regardless, it can still help big time if paired with Ruin and Devour hope.
---
Don't do it for the compliments, do it because you're a nice person and your actions sing to your heart.
---
Yes, assuming you actually get those in the bloodweb, and you feel awful because the entity decided to give you only TOTH as your only Hex (my poor P2 trapper), it‚Äôs still better to run than something like unrelenting since it could still waste survivor‚Äôs time if they do actually decide to do bones in fear of NOED
---
i absolutely love flashlights because it makes people over daring when i down someone...stand over them for a few seconds and all the flashlight hungry cockroaches come out of the wood work and i usually get a second down because of it...i used to hate flashlights till i learned how to play around them.  The flashlight blinds at pallets used to really get me now i just use sound to follow them after they flash me.
---
TLDR: Use flashlights against them and they will regret bringing them in the first place.
---
just wait until that shit goes off at night
---
What the hell is DDOS and how does joining a party accomplish it?
---
The only real solution I can see here is wait until rank reset before playing a new killer. Even then if your a red rank and get demoted to green ranks, green ranks can be hell to get out of sometimes.
---
He's strong, but the good kind of strong. High mobility, strong chase power and good "cooldown" on missed attacks
---
A tier ?
---
Top imo. he has a good map pressure. shred ability can help him end chases quicker too
---
I am disappointed by the lack of scottjund
---
Me neither, sorry if I sounded rude, I'm not a native speaker.
---
It's not too hard to counter it. Have one survivor run him around breaking as much point of view so he has to take a lot of time getting full stalk, and other people have to gen rush
---
God damn epic games trying to attract kids to a kids games!!
---
Ngl if they dont nerf him imma be mad. I'm a killer main and he's wayyyy to easy to end chases quick with. His lunge goes way too far and it's way too fast
---
I am guessing after all that license holder has been through they probably don't want to touch a video game ever again. Especially since their track record before Friday the 13th (2017) wasn't that hot *Cough Friday the 13th for NES Cough.
---
Idk why non-cleansing is a strategy. Most survivors who try to do it against me just get downed and hooked so easy because it's a 1-hit. Chase barely lasts 10 seconds.
---
He has said that about lots of games. He clearly keeps trying to shift his audience to another game besides DBD. I believe he said that about Last Year too with how short that popularity lasted.
---
It's a shame since he was the first DBD creator I found a couple years ago and is honestly the reason I got interest and found out about DBD. He just has such a sour outlook on the game and wants it to be heavily killer biased (say what you will about the balance right now) to even be fun, I will always remember how he said he wants every killer on the level of Nurse and how No Mither should be the standard for survivor.
---
Hopefully there isn‚Äôt a Claudette there
---
This is legit one of the cleverest uses of the pebble I've seen, nice job.
---
Noed from the start of the game and can attack while clocked
---
Mom said it‚Äôs my turn to repost this meme.
---
I like Demogorgon's mori, but it's a worse version of Hag's.
---
he is mid high, pretty balanced
---
No fucking way.
---
Billy and nurse are S tier. Huntress Spirit and Freddy are A tier.
---
Billy is the best killer and it's not even close.
---
Yes. With Demi-Logorgon

Wait- Clown Mains exist? Dude! Gimme some advice! I like playing him but I always find myself just black pipping (rank 5/4 atm)

Do you have 64-bit Windows installed?
---
i get asking about the offering if you don't have it, cant see the description. but honestly what is the point of asking when the answer is literally in the description.
---
Imagine going against a Clown. (I haven‚Äôt seen one in a month)
---
Second time you post about this stream but "forgets" to mention its for **MOBILE** on the title. 
---
Soon people will start making threads asking "where is the DBD stream?!?!"
---
Patrol antifarm
---
Pretty obvious I think...
---
Openly states he hates the game and only plays it because it makes him the most money
---
I guess? I don't really have tiers for killers myself
---
Because disliking the game for completely okay reasons is same as being evil /s
---
you dont even have to click the post to see the mobile part.....
---
"few"

High mid tier from what Icve played, but fun for both sides
---
Just turn left or right
---
Simpler chart: All-toxic
---
It‚Äôs a new mode they‚Äôre introducing that will expand upon the lore of the game. It will include cutscenes and missions you can do to unlock cosmetics and bonus items in game.
---
It's because I post them on Instagram, where they get stolen from me all the time.
---
We don‚Äôt exist up there :( I usually hover around ranks 15-12, I believe the highest I‚Äôve ever got on only clown is like 7 of 8
---
Ears are more underrated
---
Looks more like a young Rambo if you ask me.
---
Showing kindness expecting gratitude. Doing right things for wrong reasons.
---
I feel like his mask is iconic and should be fully visible, I think without the bottom part covering his jaw it would be a nice skin.
---
He's definitely not Spirit or Nurse level, maybe not even Billy level, somewhere around Huntress/Hag level.
---
I think the best way to ask/think about him is similar to how you would think about Spirit/Nurse and Billy. You want Billy for not optimal survivors, you want Spirit/Nurse for optimal survivors.
---
Don't get me wrong, he's still strong he just doesn't have the potential of Spirit/Nurse, meaning that against fully optimised teams you'll be lucky to get 1 kill.
---
Are people still complaining about not being able to see Claudette's? Claudette's are easy to see as any other survivor you guys probably need to turn your brightness up or use shadowborn for a wider fov.
---
Is it bad that I miss watching TydeTyme? He was one of the first content creators for DbD, and the guy that got me into the game in the first place
---
Look man it happens. People see something that they dont fully understand so they ask. I‚Äôm guilty of it. I‚Äôve asked a couple really stupid answers on reddit, and the people who go out of their way to be dicks are just assholes. Like there‚Äôs people who English is their second language and maybe they don‚Äôt completely understand. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs everyone. But like I said in my first post. It takes more time to think of some Dickish comment and post it than it takes to just keep scrolling. 
---
It just saddens me how we as humans can be mean to each other so quickly instead of being helpful. 
---
Imagine in the real world, some guy needs a taxi so he asks a taxi driver if he can take him home or whatever. The taxi driver offended at such a stupid question says yeah no shit I‚Äôm a fucking taxi driver that‚Äôs what I do. 
---
I‚Äôm rambling now... I just wish people would put as much effort into being nice as they do being mean.
---
Well.... yeah if you prestige, you‚Äôre not going to have any perks if you don‚Äôt save bloodpoints. Of course other players who didn‚Äôt recently prestige are going to have better things.
---
Filapapplication
---
For 5 minutes? That's basically for a whole match!
---
By using adult content
---
Damn, but why only on console tho? I mean you got something like prayer beads for spirit with the same rareity and prayer beads beeing like twice as strong. Plus you can just wake up and make it useless not like the instadown hatches with huntress that arent op at all like comeon why freddy didnt he suffered enough
---
&gt;I will always remember how he said he wants every killer on the level of Nurse and how No Mither should be the standard for survivor
---
And there's his issue. Tyde is emblematic of everything wrong with the killer community. He fostered a mindset among killer mains that they are an oppressed people and that it's the fault of all Survivior mains. He told killer mains that they get to play whatever strategy they desire and Surviviors shouldn't counter it, but if a Survivior team tries to counter it then suddenly his next video is gonna be "why Borrowed time is a fundamentally broken perk part 1 of 27: the 68th installment in the "broken Survivior perks" video playlist". 
---
Tyde wants the game to be a bully simulator. Just in the opposite direction of what people use bully simulator to refer to.
---
Interesting perks. The pallet one sounds amazing.
---
Sex god
---
i dont think this is how the template works.
---
Actually Bricky is bringing back the case file series!
---
I would like to update now my phone is at 100%
---
Your name is incredibly ironic.
---
Not if they are SWF.
---
Also, once they know you have spirit fury, that'll make 2 of your perks useless: Enduring and SF
---
How are legion and ghostface similar?? Why is everyone saying this?
---
Bruh just move to the left/ right and dont walk in a straight line its so simple. Otherwise he is just a normal killer with a teleportation abilty which can be countered aswell
---
&gt;good content creators

What I hate about spine chill is that  sometimes trying to back off I ll fall into the killer. Thats why I run premo

---
Regardless, I would still prefer actual stickers. A patch design just wouildn't look right on the side of a computer case
---
Never close my google tabs
---
He‚Äôs around Huntress/Hag/Freddy
---
DS at highest tier is active for 60 seconds which is a long fucking time. I find I pretty often find the person who was unhooked even after letting them leave, what am I supposed to do then, just let them go again?
---
Even then, they're dropping pallets early and giving up valuable time that could be bought with more loops. It's still a win in terms of time.
---
You also can't guarantee reaching a pallet early enough which can make for some free downs that also burn a pallet.
---
Holy fuck you killed him
---
Dude I care less about rank anymore I literally want to have fun in whenever I become red I'm not having any fun at all a strap-on noed a nurses calling and put on my angry face
---
I think he's pretty balanced, probaly good C or B Tier
---
We nust never speak of the anonymous tab
---
You better switch ace for David or were gonna have a problem.
---
Tyde is a flagrant killer fanatic and Noob plays killer and Survivior rather equally iirc.
---
This is perfect
---
That's not THICC...
---
The ultimate daddy.
---
Maybe some more tactical emotes sure but nothing like dances and stuff, that‚Äôd just be dumb and wouldn‚Äôt fit the game.
---
Noobs alright. He's not the best, but he's good for a few laughs here and there. I've been watching some of his other content lately. 
---
But fuck Tyde and Ochido. They both belong in the trash. 
---
We should give more recognition to small content creators
---
You seem to not understand the issues they‚Äôre addressing. They admit that they solve it, but they‚Äôve said multiple times it is something they shouldn‚Äôt have had to change anyway, since it‚Äôs a stupid design choice. And besides that, the other thing they address is how the devs design a perk to ‚Äúfix‚Äù a shitty/flawed design in the game, like a bandaid instead of actually fixing it; the other complication to this is that it forces you to waste a perk slot for something that shouldn‚Äôt exist as it does. Not sure why you have an attitude, since they‚Äôre making valid points.
---
if this works ill do this for everything. Gofund my drinking habits
---
We don't expect it, I just guess it would be nice to be thanked is all üòï after all there's no gain from throwing away that 4k.
---
It does, even though it doesn't say it. Combo that with resilience and you'll vault windows AND pallets 25% faster
---
Unless you‚Äôre using any other view than the new default
---
Let's be completely honest here. Tyde wants no mither base kit and every killer to be nurse tier. 
---
He wants the game balanced around 4ks. And the fact that BHVR refuses to do so is what angers him
---
The fact that Hybrid Panda isn‚Äôt here is disrespectful.
---
Most low tier killers can work... Most times when you see a low tier killer in red ranks they're running their best add-ons (Iri head, Iri king, tuft, incense, etc).
---
Then there's Legion, which is THE best killer at high ranks if your goal is to rank up.
---
It's basically impossible to depip and even with 0 kills you'll +1 pip nearly every  game just because of how his power works.
---
I like to play red ranks because it's challenging but sometimes I just wanna play to have fun and not sweating and red ranks are not for that.

Ahem, good sir, It's actually Pronounced Demodogs

Why are DbD players so obsessed with the word "toxic"? I've played multiplayer games for decades, including ones notorious for bad pvp behavior like Eve Online, and I've never heard phrases like "toxic gameplay" bandied about like they are in this community.
---
All killers with inconsistent internet connection. Luckily the dedicated servers are coming
---
I said crouch walking.. trust me, it‚Äôs not as easy as it looks. And fair enough, if that‚Äôs your perspective that‚Äôs more than fine, agree to disagree
---
I think either the spirit or the nurse would be really cool
---
As a new player, I think Int3r4ct's videos have helped me the most.
---
Can u link me those vids? I can't seem to find anything
---
*above, you seen that mouth?
---
Don‚Äôt agree with true and monto but very accurate non the less
---
True constantly blames his losses on random shit, it‚Äôs literally never a misplay on his part apparently, blame totem spawn, map gen, good survivor, too many pallets, bad map etc and then when you fight with him his cult killer main following starts talking shit (hmmm maybe he‚Äôs the less toxic killer main version of ochido hmmm)
---
As for monto he‚Äôs just a shitty uninteresting let‚Äôs play channel that says 2 sentences each minute, just a personal distaste for him ig
---
Matchmaking is based on the person who invites others to their group, no matter the rank of others
---
the plague is pretty shit tbh
---
Overcharge? Thanatofobia? Surge? Lullaby? Lmfao I agree that Spirit is busted but can't agree with you on that
---
I can't lie though one time I was quite impressed by this team who ran object of obsession with three survivors and one without it. It literally made that one Survivor invisible to me and while I chase the other three rapidly he was soloing the generators. Luckily he didn't do any bones and I happen to have no one escapes death. I wouldn't have got to kill that game, switch but chase points and Generator kicks
---
Don't be a fuckin asshole dude.
---
Well, look at my flair. It's perfect!
---
Act like what? He didn't teabag. He used a pallet to save his teammate and the flashlight to buy him an extra couple of seconds. Everything he did was kosher.
---
A few young adults 3 guys 2 girls goes on a mountain trip in an isolated cabin. Unfortunately, a TRAPPER has set some traps in the area and kills them 1 by 1. But fortunately, one of them flash him with a flashlight and stuns him with a pallet.
---
One mans inner strength is another mans down
---
I would say exactly mid tier as no one really knows how to counter his shred consistently yet which is the main thing the gorgon has in chases, once people get good at countering it he won't seem as good anymore then he is in the PTB plus i believe shred isn't supposed to work with save the best for last,NOED etc.
---
I would love if they expanded the release... I want to play it on my Honor 8X already.
---
That has to be the dumbest argument I've ever read in this subreddit. Congrats.
---
let a nurse farm her blink challenge about two days ago and when i was healing a teammate she picked me up and hooked me after we all later her hook us twice, i was pissed lol

Rank 2 clown here. As a clown, your only power is your ability to end chases by making looping harder via slowing survivors down. Clown is probably the second best chaser in the game(Nurse gets first of course). Don't just throw bottles at survivors is the best advice. Throw a bottle at choke points so it slows them down if they try to run into it, IE: in loops or T walls. While affected by the gas, their senses are dulled so don't be afraid to try to mind game them, your odds of success are higher as a clown because the survivors are afraid of the lesser speed effect. Reload after each hook, not on the down, allows you to not give time for flashlight/pallet saves. Bamboozle works great with him btw because it just adds a bit more chase strength. Get good at moonwalking is a good tip in general, and works great with his gas effect messing up vision further. Also get good at hail Mary's, learn how to throw accurately in flat areas and learn how to throw into tall things like trees so the gas effect falls downwards and surprises survivors.
---
If I made this seriously, mommy Huntress would be my s tier.
---
good, it should be loud AF. the only actually scary killer other than trapper.
---
I say scary very lightly, its not really scary but its the closest to scary.
---
Yea, his opinion on Demogorgon was basically, it's not Nurse. If it isn't an easy 4k, double pip then it's to survivor favored then.
---
I have a feeling if it were to involve a original killer it would be trapper as he is the Staple Killer. But I have a feeling the premise would be getting lost at a camping trip, entity taking advantage and dragging them all to the campfire where they soon realize they are in one of the maps and the rules of the game apply as they have to decide whether they help their friends,themselves or help everyone else get out, by taking the time to figure out how to repair a busted generator without being caught.. I have a feeling if perks were used, Insidious would be a great perk for tension as the premise could be the Trapper knows what's up so just plays with the fact the victims don't understand the heartbeat. Maybe it will end with them all dying but ending up back at the campfire where they realize.. there is no way out.. they are doomed to torment and death.. over.. and over.. until they are nothing but empty husks...like most players of DbD after a rough day.
---
That wasn‚Äôt very cash groovy of that Trapper to do.
---
Why did I sort by controversial.
---
It looks good, don‚Äôt let these people be mean
---
Wow, never experienced that before. That's a whole lotta effort from them on PS4 lol.
---
Haha, you mean: "What survivors think what killers feel when they DC while killers pick them up".
---
Nah, I loop well and run spine chill sometimes. It really helps against stealth killers, Spirit and even let you vault Windows and pallets faster
---
He was referring to Freddy. Go watch Stranger things. You are well part the point of spoilers being ok at this point though.
---
The timer didn't run out on it; you can go back and checked. He probably had 10-15% of the timer left.
---
Make it so that he doesn‚Äôt trigger spine chill and so he completely invisible when cloaked
---
You can shut the hatch?!
---
Lmao on Friday  I got a 4k with blood warden after pretending to farm until end game was near done
---
A good wraith is better than a good clown but overall clown is probably better.
---
Get out.
---
NOW
---
It looks really good! Have you thought about adding rips, makeup, or paint for a ‚Äúdisheveled woods‚Äù feeling?
---
fucking get up my karma!
---
Best Huntress cosplay I've seen.
---
Crouch walking isn‚Äôt actually that difficult though lol
---
This is just local meme, relax
---
it looks like a comic strip style parody of rainbow six siege. i think it‚Äôs the operator fuse elbow dropping the hostage lmao
---
Daddy Myers having all these hoes flocking around him
---
Had a friend who was about to Prestige so he ran his last Ebony Mori essentially as a joke. He usually leaves the Mori until last hook anyways since he knows its unfair.
---
He gets into a match and there's two people teabagging him from across the map with Object of Obsession. He's playing Trapper and running (as he called it) "the basic bitch chase build" so he decided fuck it and chased the Survivors and Moried them on second down.
---
Survivors call him out in post game chat. They're running flashlights, instaheals, adrenaline, DS, dead hard...
---
Yup. Moris are unfair but instaheals aren't.
---
Personally, I prefer having to duck Corrupt Purge over playing No Mither with the noise reduction reversed.
---
What about it?
---
I haven‚Äôt read it and I don‚Äôt want to be the generic ‚ÄúOMG itS U DiS Gu s t I nG Su RvIvorS/ K I‚Äôll er s T ha T r Uin Th I s CommU n It y‚Äù but fr, stfu your actually giving it a bad rep, balancing things out doesn‚Äôt make the first guys post right and it certainly doesn‚Äôt justify yours
---
He's done it before, leaving Smite for DBD.
---
i dont think his power would original tho i think he has the potential to be as good as nurse and with addons as interesting as myers
---
It really is. Fucking PS Messages App made sending hate mail and troll mail much easier.
---
Being a very good perk is completely different from it being underrated.
---
I mean, they mostly 'fixed' the glitch by changing how DS works. Previously, a killer could pick you up, walk a few steps and then hit a wall whilst you were DSing him to cancel the DS (just needed precise timing). With DS triggering in the pick-up, I've not seen that glitch since..
---
but guess it might still be there for catch animations (to be fair, that IS a rare case). Could be related specifically to Nurse (who gets stunned by her own ability whilst catching people after a blink), too.
---
I remember I met a friend of mine I wanted to introduce to dbd a while ago, unfortunately they have severe coulrophobia and the upcoming dlc, at the time was the clown. -.
---
That sounds obscurely overpowered, and I‚Äôm a killer player who thinks Wraith ain‚Äôt good right now either.
---
Killer don‚Äôt really get anything if they don‚Äôt kill the survivor. Survivors don‚Äôt have to survive to get a good amount of BP so if you are farming I believe that the killer should get the kill in the end.
---
Thanks, thought they were guest killers
---
I‚Äôm a guy and ochido asked underage girls for nudes and got mad when they said no
---
A quality stranger things meme 
---
The Divines Smile Upon you Friend
---
I even got hatemail from a killer who legit got the game 3 hours prior to my match against him and he said I should kms cause I told him he should watch some youtube tutorials cause he was pretty bad at running loops.
---
And yet insidious and wraith‚Äôs discount insidious exist
---
As he said in the video, he is trying to showcase why old legion was broken. He never advised anyone to do anything
---
But were you there to watch his ass get looped for 4 gens before he raged  like a child and banned someone?
---
If you're going to try to correct me, try to actually read my full comment, as it seems to me that you've disregarded a key point or two. Also learn to spell more consistently.
---
good
---
I think he‚Äôs referring to how he forgot (or just pretended He forgot) the Nea that farmed was hooked
---
It is underrated. No one runs it despite it being incredibly strong. The only people I see running it (excluding my SWF group who I preach to about it constantly) are immersed Claudettes and Urban Evasion Neas, and amazingly enough those immersed Clauds and UE Neas are the only ones I see survive when playing like that.
---
It's almost like they have an incredibly powerful perk that no one runs because "muh adrenawin" ü§î
---
&gt;When i am home and want to game, i much rather play on my amazing PC version with the 144 FPS and 27 inch monitor with great controls
---
I don't think a mobile version of ANY game is meant to be preferred over a variant on a different platform like console or pc. Obviously the other version of dbd will be better.
---
I've never heard anyone talk about painkiller. He is a really good player with high quality and amazing videos and guides. Imagine Otz but with no facecam and a soothing voice
---
When I play survivor, I find it super annoying to deal with Corrupt Purge and every time someone cleanses it fucks the whole team over.
---
That's why I go for the cleanser which is probably the only survivor who cleanses so their team doesn't get fukt.
---
I can relate. Not the being clown main part though
---
It's said they failed a lot of times to actually get to that stage or something. I dunno, benedict lore shit.
---
So, if survivors don't cleanse, they completely deprive plague of her ability, making her an M1 killer, yes they're constantly wounded, but that doesn't really matter if they're good at looping
---
It's annoying, yeah, but less lethal than spending the whole game broken.
---
Holy shit it looks amazimg! If dbd was serial you shold play Huntress!
---
Even worse. Get your own account.
---
I just got past that episode last night, even got the screenshot cap'd and shared on my discord to share with my friends.
---
And yet, you've beaten me to the punch. Bravo i say.
---
I'll DC on a Dr especially on The Game just because the sounds are so annoying. Legion I don't get he's much easier to play against than nurse, Billy, and spirit.
---
When I read laugh, I expected his pallet stun tittering ngl.
---
Whoops
---
Loooooove!! 
---
One thing I noticed: for a photo that looked like it was taken with an iPhone, the photographer really didn‚Äôt need to watermark on the photo. I‚Äôd look for a new photographer next time.
---
Honestly I just don't give a shit. It makes the match easier for me and they've lost out on points
---
No idea, he is literally top 3 weakest killer in the game, and usually getting a pip against it is very easy.
---
The other day i played as SWF on **DISCORD** and one of our guys actually DCed after being downed by the legion
---
He complained the legion M1ed him lol
---
Easily one of the best films
---
The best part is trapping one of the exist after you hook someone (of course the window is already trapped), and then later following scratch marks back to the basement, and then trapping the 2nd exit as the unhook is happening.
---
There is no escape.
---
One match all the survivors were constantly outclassing the killer. Had maybe 5 hits all match despite chasing everyone, no hooks. I maxed my chase score, so I decided to give them a hook for free.
---
They face camped me and the randos couldn't work together to get me unhooked.
---
No problem :) If you wonder ither devs killers are trapper, wraith, billy, nurse, huntress, plage, spirit and clown.
---
omg
---
How much people run it =/= it‚Äôs rating. So many players at rank 1 try out random builds for fun. Similarly to how a lot of people don‚Äôt run adrenaline because they‚Äôd rather try out fun builds, or how some killers don‚Äôt run ruin to add extra challenge. Just browse the sub for posts involving spine chill, most if not all go crazy over it
---
Remember that you tubers play a lot of games that don‚Äôt get put into a video because they are not interesting enough
---
Damn you're good at drawing
---
I think your first problem was ‚Äúavid mobile gamer‚Äù. There isn‚Äôt a single good mobile game
---
Don't think they have the resources to blow on Steam-engine video footage that is only up for a few months each.
---
Albeit they COULD indeed make a new intro showcasing a little more killer variety and use that from now on
---
I just laugh and say ‚Äúnow I don‚Äôt have to spend time hooking someone and can go right towards that fool that ran into my bear trap!‚Äù
---
nobody used the word ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù mate, I simply said that such an activity at that sort of speed, I, as well as most with regular human limbs would consider ‚Äúagile‚Äù. I highly doubt you‚Äôre capable.
---
The Divines Don't Smile Upon you Friend
---
Dbd only runs at 60fps.
---
I main Ghostface so this resonates with me so much
---
Love how Tru3ta1ent never really teabags or anything like that, always fighting toxicity !
---
How do you have access to mobile?
---
Considering you know nothing about me.. it‚Äôs pretty fuckin bold of you to assume that I do, mate xD
---
Thank you. Yes. I am probably still a potato killer honestly, but I have tried the hold trigger and it doesn‚Äôt seem to work. Weird.
---
The scariest thing about Spirit is Rancor. 
---
You have no idea how much my heart sinks when I see the killers aura after a gen is done and I don't have dark sense. My immediate reaction is to start crying.
---
Suppose so. Thanks for the reply!
---
He is such a chaotically wild entity, I swear. His videos are what got me into the game about a year ago and hearing him just tear the game down really showed how he feels. I saw he put a video about the new chapter and I tuned in for a few minutes and had to click off because his first few minutes was just the same old thing ‚ÄúThe killer looks mediocre and the music is bad‚Äù and I was just like ‚ÄòWhy even make a video about it if you‚Äôre just gonna harp on it like last time?‚Äô He doesn‚Äôt even look happy to be in the video either and I‚Äôm sure he was much better off making content for DeathGarden or whatever else he moved into. 
---
He‚Äôs a strange person.
---
Noob always say that a killer is perfect in the first week
---
Anything from AHS
---
&gt; Now the hard part is, how do you make iron will not a requirement without nerfing spirit into the ground?
---
Ive already made it clear i don‚Äôt want her to be nerfed into the ground,
---
I want ironwill to not be a requirement and for spirit to be buffed or changed to compensate for that. 
---
Please red more than the title before commenting next time.
---
Respectfully disagree.
---
HybLove!!!!!! Chaotic good I‚Äôd say haha what a good dude though
---
I said to do it to troubleshoot your issue :-|
---
He needs to fuck off bc he's making the DBD environment even more biohazardous than it already is (and it's this Biohazardous partially due to him In the first place)
---
Ps4 dbd. Longest wait time for me was 48 min.
---
Persona 4 was amazing
---
It also combos reallllllly well with BBQ and Chili if I decide to run that. But I usually run the impossible skillcheck build. Unnerving, Distressing, Huntress, Overcharge, etc.
---
I mean.  I just started playing again, not having played since it was first released.  Strategy wise, am I not better off prestiging claudette and getting all the perks on her and playing her as my main?
---
the best
---
Love this!!! This is amazing!!
---
A lag switch represents a deliberate throttling of your connection speed. A download, such as itunes or adobe reader, can get opportunistic sometimes and force a similar result, as can something big in the background whoch hogs your cpu.
---
Shouldn't have saved the Dwight. He could have just left lmao.
---
TimetD
---
Heavily nerf/remove lightburn. And alter the way he uncloaks to give him more mindgame potential. 
---
And increase cloaked movement speed to give him more map pressure.
---
No love for Hexy on this sub ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings?
---
Or you just like to act like a Chad when trying to make a point with no basis
---
Keep it up, I'm sure you are such an intellectual with that kind of behavior
---
Tell me when you stop reeeing ok buddy?
---
actually no never mind this is the worst tierlist i‚Äôve seen
---
It's impossible to lose as killer on mobile in my experience
---
Truth be told, I play the game since the end of 2017, and I swear to god the hitboxes became worse and worse with each patch. Latency is a thing, poor hitboxes are another thing...
---
Take it a step further, one button for the laugh, a second sliding button for the heartbeat, the third button for  clones, and finally, a button to make the shock therapy sound effect.
---
And then when a good one finally shows up it's paired with another good one, so you have to choose between them.
---
Literally just saw this picture on Instagram
---
You mean they try anything they can to win!? OH NO!!!! /s
---
What are you talking about?  Every single one of my friends that are in the 15-20 ranks use that perk.  Every. Single. Dude.  You're blowing smoke out of your ass.
---
do you mean N00b3 or Tru3?
---
Oh wow you turn around quickly. 
---
Okay lemme ask you a question, when you play the game do you also facecamp hooks and wonder why you get genrushed or is patronizing child and facecamping bitch something exclusive to Tyde?
---
N00b3. I remember cause the videos had his Nea art pic plastered on the videos.
---
It isnt allowed.
---

1. Hoplite

2. Polytopia

3. I Love Hue
---
The popup appear's in a locker,yes?
---
Nurse is pretty OP if you can use her correctly, same with hillbilly, but if you're just looking for an easy killer to play and win, I'd buy leatherface, he's really good! It's a shame though, because you'd be called nooby for using him as he's really easy.
---
Uhh because its a horribly inefficient way to do gens. Its faster just to miss the hex skill check. Gentappers are doing you a favor.
---
Petition to have a new killer that is a lock Smith
---
Bill has the most swag so.
---
IMO, Wraith. Clown lacks map pressure but he's good at ending chases very fast, while Wraith has nothing to help in a chase outside of uncloaking for the speed boost. I think it depends on what you think is better, chase ending or map pressure
---
Hey I got banned for a British teeth meme ‚Äúdark meme‚Äù
---
Nerf Moris so they can only be used for death hook (or revert Decisive strike but prevent juggling when a Mori is burned) and then I'll be on board with this
---
What is that image.
---
It's be a waste of money for bhvr I bet
---
Lmfao. I screenshot everytime a killer dc‚Äôs and i upload them. I can‚Äôt wait till my profile upgrades so i can showcase them and let that be the first thing killers see when they want to snoop on profiles before starting games. I call it the dc hall of shame.
---
\*Yawn\* is all I'm gonna say to this and to you.  
---
Have fun getting worked up over nothing buddy!
---
Hahaha, don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs not what you were insinuating
---
It wasn‚Äôt, I was insinuating that it seems you believe most people aren‚Äôt capable of doing physical tasks.
---
Well with object that would completely counter his ability and make him useless and spine chill would confer him too
---
That mask is incredible, good job!
---
You don't have to be the best to know to look where the killer is going to come from.
---
Building your own pc is always the cheaper option. Personally i bought a pre made pc because i know fuck all about computers, but if your budget isnt huge then search what specs are the best for the games you want to play, and order them all üëç
---
Jason, wait wrong game. Don't make me go back.
---
I‚Äôve got 3000 hours. I‚Äôve tried it. It‚Äôs laughable.
---
The Hag, but specifically with a Mori. I don't want no Small skinny bitch eating my liver when she pulls it straight out of my body.

Obviously a male face, and his story indicates as such.

ZubHams is the single best emote on twitch

at base it takes 80 seconds to complete a gen when two people i believe its 40 seconds
---
Download it through TapTap
---
I have all my Survivors at 50 I'm mostly looking who to Prestige at this point.
---
I just need a Bloodpoint sink for my extra BP.
---
It's not enough. 1 mil only gets you to level 35-40, and if you have every teachable in the game like me, the chances of getting anything you want are pretty low... Thank God for the bloodweb changes
---
Ughhhhhhhhh. Again, the only thing I suggested, was that a majority of people wouldn‚Äôt be able to  squat AND walk AS FAST as Ghostface does in-game. That is all. Not talking about other physical tasks/activity.. JUST squat-walking at a consistent pace more rapid than normal walking.
---
I just wiggle or spin on the ground as frustration sometimes. Not always a macro.
---
it is funny bc I found that meme on this subreddit
---
"they're just innocent political views, like wanting the darks out of America, what's so wrong with that?"
---
Yeah but dont expect it to work at higher ranks though
---
Stupid question...it's pretty obvious ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Its ying from palidins
---
I just want to make it clear that I asked the guy for permission to post this and he was a really cool guy about it and I even decided to go into a custom game with him and teach him about some stuff in the game   I just wanted to make that clear because I‚Äôm getting insulted about this and they think I ‚Äútook it too far‚Äù
---
Wouldn't a flashlight be better suited to the meme?
---
Also what's this from?
---
Why the fuck did he not stop before the pallette when he saw you run up to it? That's just him being dumb.
---
This really needs some gold
---
Facing doctor is super fun. The other day i ran one around for like 10 minutes he was so salty post game lol
---
Yeah idk, puppets said it and I was like haha yeaüòÇüòÇ
---
Also: the new stealth effect counters Spine Chill. Now we have another useless perk
---
A lot of patches ruined the balance it had, mostly because people didnt like that they could be bullied playing Jason (if they were new and didnt know how to handle survivors ganging on them)
---
So Jason is practically unstopable once he is enraged now, the boat now gives a warning sound to Jason when its started (stupid because the boat is supposed to be the stealth but limited escape option and Jason HAD to pay attention to it or lose 2 survivors) not to mention the glitches they been accumulating that prevent interactions, destroy vehicles, get people stucked, etc.
---
Honestly I am happy I played it at the time I did because right now the game is getting patched with more problems than solutions.
---
I didn‚Äôt t bag. My trigger gets stuck and I have to press it twice to fix it sometimes.  Also I‚Äôm not asking for upvotes I just wanted to post this because I thought it was funny that this went on for a while   I messaged the guy after and I asked him if I can post it and he said it‚Äôs ok and he doesn‚Äôt mind.   So can you not insult me and keep this thread simple.  And I got more of what happened after this with this killer in a new comment that I put in the thread so I advise you to check that out so you can see I‚Äôm not ‚Äúa total fucking idiot‚Äù
---
Nah man. Keys. All weekend. Every killer game someone brought a keyüòÇüòÇ
---
In League of legends the harder champions aren't OP even if played optimally. I don't think its good game design to have the harder characters be over powered.
---
I love Diversion.
---
Especially when you're running bt or deliverance and the other person isn't.
---
Mine runs at 144fps
---
Damn Megs
---
He was like rank 20 lmao
---
Yeah but the Freddy thing is mainly because of the rework, had he been a higher tier the snares wouldnt be a thing
---
When the P3 Claudette also has TTV in their username
---
You need a DRINK!
---
He can do it in Spanish and use English subtitles, that way both languages are covered nicely.
---
Ying and hag Even more iconic than Ying and Yang
---
There's a lot of pieces of bad design with this game but saying "(X) exists so (Y) is fine" is not a good way to do balance.
---
Call me stupid but i really thaught IT was more for 18+ olds
---
Well, shit.
---
Fr fr I love playing against Doctor
---
I was wondering how much the dlc would cost so i appreciate this post
---
I mean use it whenever you want but don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna wait 10 minutes for a game just for it to end in 5 minutes and then derank
---
This doesn't only apply to the demogorgan.
---
She is is also a pretty clear League of Legends clone
---
I‚Äôm hating on my main lol
---
Definitely playing BL3. Waiting five years for it, much rather play a game that is enjoyable than to deal with the same toxicity every time a new chapter drops.
---
Funny because hag and ying are my mains
---
Dude that dash can be spooky if you don't see them.
---
I'm crying laughing please save me
---
No please! Anything but that!
---
I find it more fun to try and only 2 hook everyone and just keep pressure on them with chases and then let very obviously left them escape. Usually get 1 who calls me a baby killer ez gg and at least one who says thanks for the fun game
---
The Divines Smile Upon you friend
---
I vote Wraith. He's my least favorite to play against because he's so terrifying. Clown is a very close second, but there's already a popular clown slasher.
---
im so split on this one. On one hand, Jesus fuck you monster. On the other, if you need to sacrifice for a daily or are just currently trying to rank up, giving them a few extra points is better than nothing if you are going to kill them either way
---
Did that to a pig in Ormond Lodge. Just break the freakin pallet!
---
Well now you know your not against a 4 man SFW.

The Divines Fucked you my friend

They're rated 15, it's in the Stranger Things target audience.
---
Been messaged twice by people I've chain dropped to free calling me a noob. Bitch I killed the other 3 and let you open the exit gate. How do you think you outplayed me
---
Right, but again, it‚Äôs still very small connections. Honestly, the way they wrote the characters in the way that we were supposed to perceive them as frenzying killers, they seem more like the purge than ghostface. Again, ghostface wasn‚Äôt written in the original films or in the dbd lore to be a frantically killing lunatic, but rather, a group (or in dbds case, an individual) that went about their murders with a plan in place. Remember, legion only killed 1 person, and it wasn‚Äôt even a planned attack.
---
I feel that
---
Oh then om the fool sorry people my bad
---
Endgame Collapse, and get a free hug from the Entity!
---
Personally, I think killers need more perks to slow down gens. The only reason killers are weak is because gens get done way too fast. Or I guess,there should just be perks to help with map control. The killers that are op like nurse and hillbilly are so overpowered because they have good map control.
---
David is a decent start (I usually recommend people start with Meg) and Kate is a pretty good survivor to make your main, most people who want advantages will play her or Ace.
---
Been a known bug since patch 2.6.4 - so 5 months now. Happened to me 6 times since then.
---
My thoughts on deafened is that it's an effect that's programmed into the game but it's only used on one Killer's Very Rare addon which rarely sees any use. I'd like to see the effect used more and I think applying it to Spirit makes a lot of contextual sense. If you're moving between dimensions you'd have trouble hearing into the other world, but you'd still probably be able to make *something* out. It's a simple solution that still allows a Spirit to run Stridor if they want to benefit from that playstyle, but doesn't let them have that tool for free.

I will if you give me hatch.

Unless you're planning to collect all the perks for the sake of completion, you're better off not grinding for them all tbh. Many of them aren't very good for "meta" builds‚Äîbut who cares about those right? *Laughter* Seriously though, even if you're just going for the fun builds (like boil over+flip flop+unbreakable), some perks just aren't worth unlocking (left behind and wake up come to mind).
---
Getting David's WGLF is a huge boon for your first few hours. I remember using it a lot until I got most of the perks I wanted. After David, I suggest going for Jake if you really want IW, then Meg (her 3 perks are useful for a variety of playstyles), Claudette (same as Meg), then the rest of the survivors. Most of them have at least one or two good perks (Nea-BL, UE; Bill-Unbreakable, BT; Feng-Lithe, Alert; etc.)
---
I can't say for sure how effective IW is (since I don't play killer) but it does seem to work. Many times when I put it on and get behind a dumpster, I expect the killer to instantly find me, but instead they assume I headed elsewhere. Working around good perks like IW is always fun. Try using it with Quick and Quiet.
---
Also, hi, welcome to Dead by Daylight!
---
It would be nice, but I‚Äôd like to think I gave them a good experience
---
Probably. I now know why I got downvoted. Rip. This was totally my mistake. I saw I comment about N00b3 but I must‚Äôve mixed it up with Tru3 comment thread. 
---
Yeah, Tru3 is alright in my books. Talks too fast to understand at times but he‚Äôs not toxic at all, from what I‚Äôve seen.
---
I've seen him being pissy lol. He's a good player but he has days that it feels like he's ranting for everything. Claiming people are stalking him and that's why he's losing as killer. So on and so forth. I'm just saying the truth but if they dont wanna hear it. That's fine. I don't really care anyways. He wants lots of unsafe palettes and all that stuff. I don't like that side of him. I'm a survivor main

MY STACKS! My staaacks!!  D,:

Yea in a SWFs anything is useful but for solos it's really bad because will your teammates even save you will 34 seconds even matter. I'm more concerned about solo survivor play then SWF

Hi my name is u/TeddyBearKilla69 and I've never played against a Spirit past Rank 15.
---
Survivors that do nothing but play immerse the whole game, hiding in corners, refusing to touch a gen if the killer is within 100m, letting their team die aren‚Äôt fun to verse or to have as team mates. :)
---
And there‚Äôs a discord that he frequently talks in, for his followers,  @OtzdarvasDungeon
---
As a survivor main, I would be very pleased with the 3rd perk.
---
The part about getting bullied in school is so specific that I can't help but wonder if he's projecting a bit
---
Yea but it‚Äôs cringe af like they were prob too scared to take the aggro all game and the only time they act confident is at the exit gates where the killer is powerless lmao
---
Ok
---
What about piggy
---
This is the Nirvana font lol
---
True! But I don't want to waste their time when they've been so nice
---
Not only would it be a nice way to get an extra loop in, you could also counter other perks like Bamboozle
---
Haha these dudes always trying to make a debate üòÇüòÇüòÇ its a meme !

I used to watch TT. Dbd was the first game where I could watch multiple games and not be bored

Thank you for answering :) with "not perfect English" I mean not perfect pronunciation. Do you think people would mind it?? Spanish dbd community is not that big that's we are looking for an English channel.

or seeing a him around a corner while in Shred range
---
Noob3, Monto, and tru3 are all entertaining
---
I dont think there's be much trouble after the lawsuit is finished. But considering it recently got worse, with NECA no longer able to develop new figures (though they can still release ones already designed), it could be a while.
---
Otz is best fight me
---
Maybe his power could be the other killers powers but maybe dummed down or something like that?   
---
Like his add-ons could enable him to do other killers powers.   
---
1 could make him throw up, 1 could make him stalk/creep around and maybe 1 could make it so he could lay down traps that would trigger if you walked near them?
---
I think something like this would be cool since Pennywise changes himself and his looks for each of his victims. To make them as scared as he can. Of course they abilities would be much for advanced than just be able to throw up?  
---
Like "After hooking a survivor, You're able to \_\_\_\_\_\_" and the ability would perhaps be dummed down.
---
And that's why you shouldn't give a killer built in insidious with instadown potentia. They'll just use it to camp
---
&gt; there's no gain from
---
Yes this meme I made is epic gamer relatable
---
Thank you! With subtitles you mean Spanish+English subs, English + English or not speaking at all and just English explanations like Pyrus???

I got banned on the DbD Discord before for posing a meme that had endgame spoilers lol.

If you're going to steal memes at least remove the watermark.

Watch his big brain trapper analysis. It improved both my hag and trapper. Really shows you how to manage threats and properly hide you red stain and control the map. Otz also uses some really unique perks which can help you solidify a more unique play style and get the jump on survivors who don‚Äôt understand what you are using. Monto can also help but he doesn‚Äôt explain as much he only does it, just a lil bit.
---
Not a movie but a Tv series anthology. I would love to start with Adiris's back story and Jane's to set up the tone of the series by putting extravagant production.
---
Come on, man. As a Ghostface main, can't you at least *act* scared? For me? Please?
---
Billy S tier are you out of your mind? You are basically saying billy is as good as nurse? Whats your rank?
---
he said ‚Äúthat explains the 110 movement speed‚Äù. i don‚Äôt get why people can‚Äôt just fucking behave themselves
---
Aight, imma head out
---
I use it against spirit and lemme tell you god tier perk
---
???
---
Wild you type this if they ax sully fixed the matchmaking?
---
Thank you for answering. Do you think that this would be just as good as doing full English??
---
Also, with not perfect English I mean not perfect pronunciation. We are thinking about doing this as a meme making funny content as the same time (like putting a Mariachi sombrero in the thumbnails lol)
---
The beginning part of when the killer notices Meg floating, how he slowly back-steps away just kills me.
---
okay thats fucked up. OP dont listen to the guy that said this.
---
To be fair if you watch that video, it clearly looks like teabagging. No one is assuming anything they saw your video and saw you teabagging a lower killer, if you opened up in the description with what you said here, you most likely wouldnt of gotten all the hate you got.
---
Remember everything is about context, you post this with zero context or story behind it you are definitely going to get hate.
---
That's why I'm always running borrowed time
---
As a community, no, but there are some friendly people that I‚Äôve ran into
---
Obv it‚Äôs the purple who dcs and not anyone else.

I get messages like that every time i go on that game

I got banned for accidentally posting a image of thanos penis

Dude wtf is wrong with you
---
Funny part is the low ranks didn‚Äôt dc the highest rank did lol
---
The fuck is wrong with you
---
Fuck it, let's just add all that fucking shit to the game.
---
Well I mean you did say ‚Äúgg lmao‚Äù that and gg ez gets people really angry
---
Ey! Cricket is where it's at!üòÑ
---
Oh shoot did i get the difference of low rank and high rank mixed up?
---
Please refer to rule 3. Thanks :)
---
Reasons?
---
Sort of but it‚Äôs whatever, low rank is like rank 20 high rank is rank 1 for reference, I get what u meant tho
---
Switch Demogorgon to Human and it's still the same

---
Does apple juice count?
---
I've had that happen as a survivor, yeah. Green ping in the lobby then during the match I'm teleporting and skating across the map.
---
Literally just a lunge and can dig underground, utter shite in my opinion.
---
Context: he was the last survivor having a hard time with me being a tombstone myers, I was looping around him in a pallet but when I decide to attack him he get away and it turns out that in the same area behind my back before I attack him was the hatch waiting for me, anyway is not the first time I get hate messages In my inbox but everything is only about dbd and not other game, damn I wish I can get insult in halo or something else but not this game, either way I always try no to respond by insults and just facts.
---
The smartest*
---
Fungoose has a really good educational Youtube channel for both players and killers with tips on how to loop, good strategies and perks, etc. :)

Lol sorry when i say low rank i talk about rank 1-10 and high rank is like 11-20

i aint risking for devour hope to get to 3 stacks

i think either we need a new objective thats necessary to complete in order to get to endgame or the killers in of themselves need a buff
---
All good!
---
I mean....lots of killers are pretty boring to go against. It's more or less the player behind them and the in game interactions than the killer itself.
---
Styptic Agents are for bleeding-
---
In my own case I will slug the person who got off the hook then chase the unhooker to make even more map pressure, but obviously if the unhooker gets away what am I going to do? Go look for a new target? No I'm going to go find the slug, it's all about efficiency.
---
I was laughing Because I didn't pay attention that the was a hatch behind me, and was expecting laugh my ass with him because of that, not to get that kind of messages

alright thats pretty sad and pathetic.

Sadly yeah but it is addictive, but playing as a killer there's high chances to get Insulted by just playing
---
The best play I've ever seen.
---
yeah hence why hex ruin is so strong and why it could become useless as soon as survivors learn to hit great skill checks consistently which is why think we might need a new objective to complete

*ghostface
---
If you‚Äôre a survivor try not to use pallets if you‚Äôre healthy, save them for when you‚Äôre injured because other people might need them later on. A lot of the time a killer will end up swinging at a pallet and if you just keep running it, they will often miss and it will extend your chase, wasting their time even more. 
---
If you‚Äôre a killer make sure you‚Äôre not investing too much time into chasing a survivor. If you can‚Äôt catch the survivor within a minute or so then you should forget about then and focus on generator protection. If you can‚Äôt get them to drop a pallet or get hit within a few seconds then it‚Äôs probably not worth it.
---
Thats not 100% confirmed and i personally think that demodogs age into becoming demogorgons
---
Yeah doesn‚Äôt David have No Mither and Dead Hard? Amazing when comboed with Self Care. Super OP.
---
It isnt
---
Because when you hear it 100x more often, it becomes stale and annoying.
---
When something is used more sparingly, it feels more impactful. It should have just been left as something unique to Ghostface to make things more intense and threatening. As it is, it doesn't feel scary anymore because you just expect it every game every time you are cleansing a totem. With Ghostface, it would actually come out of nowhere.
---
Same problems here on PC. MM is a complete joke, and the "lower" (higher?) you get the more toxic it becomes. Fun fact I got to 8 with a Legion farming build that runs distressing. I also find that ranks around 13-10 is the most friendly place and matches are actually fun to play. Best way to deal with it all is just to not care about rank, and for me I try to avoid ranking up occasionally just so I don't have to put up with all that.
---
I got adept with the old freddy, so thats not special with the new and better one :'D
---
No. The problem is that not all killers need the same level of buff. Spirit doesn‚Äôt need to be made faster, for example, but someone like Clown needs something to help him out.
---
Problem is, if you buff all killers you just make the high tier killers more oppressive. If you add perks as a band aid to the problem, the same thing happens - you get killers with high pressure potential running all slow down perks and the game becomes a painful slog. Same thing if they just make gens take longer, or nerf survivors - all the top tier killers would be buffed as well. 
---
The weaker killers need meaningful buffs or number tweaks, or they need to balance the maps so that it‚Äôs not as painful for someone like Leatherface to actually pressure gens.

Where‚Äôs my fucking cheese, Gromit?
---
Yep definitely, I can trust other survivors with no mither though because they are either really good or just rush generators in my experience
---
Gen rushing is literally the only thing you can do in the game since it's the only way to win as survivor.
---
*live audience laughter*
---
FoUnD ThE sUrViVoR mAiN
---
To me gen rushing is whenever the survivors ignore helping their teammates and focus on finishing gens ASAP. Most of the time when killers say gen rush they just mean the survivors doing generators instead of getting killed :P
---
Literally have a clip of him blaming his missed lunge with a demo on a fence saying ‚Äúit pushed me!!‚Äù The stationary fence....pushed him.
---
Players who can't heal have lost games for myself and the team before. One of the best perks in the game. Survivors who run around injured are an easy target.
---
Not really new no, it came out maybe a year or two ago? It‚Äôs called diversion and you basically throw a pebble and it creates a notification to the killer to throw them off
---
I can assure you toxic is used frequently in gaming communities. I've heard it all the way back in Call of Duty World at War, people referring to the dark souls community, watching WoW streamers, sometimes even heard it in reference to minecraft.
---
Other than that, toxic is use interchangeably in a serious context and joking context.
---
Maybe your community doesn't use it too much but I'm sure they have something to describe themselves in a similar fashion.
---
Is it the sound effect itself or the visual effect your griping about? I really don‚Äôt get this community honestly. There are no issues currently, we got a good chapter coming soon, and the devs are talking about dedicated servers, and instead of being happy about those things, you wanna complain about something so pointless because there‚Äôs nothing else to complain about lol
---
This can be a legit licensed toy give me a call my uncle works for Nintendo B^)
---
**P U N I S H M E N T**
---
**S T I C K**
---
Genrushing is definitely real but I mean it's the objective so as killer I don't have a problem with it just give me my bloodpoints and I'm out
---
I agree. Nurse on PC and spirit on console for the big brain killers.
---
Jake is iron will though and the perk maxed makes injured sounds 0 if the killer is not running stridor, personally i would look into unlocking bond from dwight, if you unlock the least amount of teachables possible it means you will max them out faster on other characters right? ;)
---
I remember winning games with old Freddy, not long after he came out.
---
Thank you!üòÇüòÇ it‚Äôs just a meme like laugh or don‚Äôt broüòÇüòÇü§§ it‚Äôs not a piece of art to critique

Had a bubba who insios camper me he wanted me to give h salt. I said well played you got me fair and square. Then i got some Nice salt.

Lullabys are no longer directional as of the Freddy rework update.
---
11 hours now, time to watch more
---
Censors cock but not fucking. Maybe thats why they dont thank you lol.
---
OP never said anything about a streamer and it's a God damn meme, laugh and move on. Why're you on this reddit anyway if you're going to just throw shit everywhere.
---
Intentional.
---
Intentional with a recent update, her lullaby is now non directional
---
Oh no someone saw fat movie.
---
I agree. The mods don‚Äôt seem to do anything at all. This subreddit is flooded with oversaturated content and content that doesn‚Äôt foster anything but salty attitude. It‚Äôs really draining.
---
Poor guy. The court case going on is the equivalent of parents fighting over custody after a rough divorce.
---
That's gonna be hard to get used to damn
---
Gen rushing is and isn't a thing. It is in the sense that if you have an optimal team, gens do get done way too fast. But it isn't in the sense, that's just how the devs balanced the game. It's no one's fault the devs made the gen time so short besides the devs, so getting mad at someone for playing the objective is just dumb. If you wanna get mad, get mad at the devs, not the people playing the game the way it was made to be played. My fix is easy, just increase the amount of time it takes to do gens. By how much, I'm not sure, but hopefully everyone can agree, gens get done way too fast as it is right now. Test different increases in time until we actually feel the game is a bit more balanced so at high ranks killers aren't forced into playing nurse or spirit just to have a decent game where swf don't just shit-stomp every killer that isn't spirit or nurse.
---
Not a fan of that lol
---
I tried that but my fingers cramp lol. I've heard some people use button mashing macros. I'm still mulling over if that's grimey or not.
---
yea it is very specific because most nazis like you become that way due to extreme hatred of others
---
As far as abilities go his isn‚Äôt hard to deal with so I don‚Äôt get the dcing
---
Aw similar but different maps lol
---
okay thanks for the advice
---
Juking the nurse is mostly about predicting where she‚Äôll teleport while she‚Äôs chasing you. If you‚Äôre running in a straight line in her LOS, then of course she‚Äôll hook you in no time. Yesterday I went against a 4 blink nurse and let me tell ya, it was my most fun game of the day. Not only does it feel amazing to juke her, but you‚Äôre buying extra time for your teammates when she recovers from her blinks. Try not to stay in open areas and mindgame her into thinking you‚Äôre going a certain way then go the other. If you have diversion, use it while she recovers from fatigue and 95% of the time she‚Äôll go that way unless you‚Äôre right in front of her.
---
Nothing you can do if it's the dorms wifi, you need to be an admin to change that.

Consider using your phones hotspot if it's good maybe?

i think it would make more sense for it to 60 seconds for two people to be on one gen
---
New Killer: The Dorito
---
One more crack like that and you‚Äôre outta here
---
I‚Äôm sorry these small brains are downvoting you because they can‚Äôt comprehend what mommy and daddy means. It‚Äôs a sad and pathetic world we live in.
---
Both, it was a wonderful addition when it was uniquely applied to Ghostface. Now that it is universal, it has staled out and doesn't have much impact anymore. It no longer feels fresh.
---
Sorry if having an opinion that many others seem to share and have had since the Ghostface chapter dropped is too "pointless" for you.
---
Also, this thread has nothing to do with dedicated servers or the new chapter, so it would be irrelevant to bring them up.
---
But if you want to bring those up, the dedicated servers still look like buggy as shit ass with Huntress' shotgun hatchets, Billy chainsawing through walls and everyone being Rubberband McGee.
---
As far as the new chapter, looks cool. Already shared the excitement for stranger things in private with friends, still think some of the perk ideas are a little overrated or feel like they should have been combined with older weaker perks, but still interesting.
---
No its not.
---
This is bait
---
Why use half of his name in the title then his full name in your post. Why do people to this day still call him just ‚Äúslender‚Äù? That was the name of the game! His name is slender man, you can call him slendy for short, it‚Äôs less letters to type out, and makes more sense in context. Pick which sounds better: ‚Äúoh shit, it‚Äôs slendy, behind that corner!‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh shit, it‚Äôs slender, behind that corner‚Äù what? Sooooo there‚Äôs an alleyway around that corner?? You don‚Äôt call him Iron, you call him Iron Man, you don‚Äôt call him Captain for short, just Cap, so WHY, to this day, people still call him by the name of his game, and not his name, or nickname, or aliases used in the ARGs????  I don‚Äôt know why this irks me so much, but every time he is just called ‚Äúslender‚Äù or ‚Äúthe slender‚Äù, I‚Äôm just waiting for the sentence to finish, and it never does!! Sorry for a rant that‚Äôs been 10+ years in the making.
---
It doesn‚Äôt prove anything. The guy wasn‚Äôt playing well at all. He lost because of that, not because the survivors were being tryhards. If the killer does a poor job by not patrolling or using their perks, that‚Äôs their fault, not the fault of the game‚Äôs mechanics.
---
We were both able to lose him pretty easily, I wouldn't quite say he was bad cause he got the other two pretty fast, but I didn't get to see how so I'm not sure if they were just bad or not.
---
I can understand that I later will meet Red ranks but I literally just got to rank 8 and got matched against three toxic Red ranks. That's what makes me so angry
---
You realize that‚Äôs what perks are for, right?
---
I'd rather not break my keyboard over dbd so I use macros for wiggling and struggling. Button mashing isn't skilful
---
The other comments and your answers to those are enough.
---
Be less entitled
---
And he didn‚Äôt use PGTW....
---
Not everything in this game needs to be balanced around the rank 1 players who are only like 10% of the playerbase if that
---
Gens without items are totally fair in terms of speed. The problem is all the toolboxes. Id be glad to see toolboxes and ruin both disappear since they counter each other. When one team doesnt have one, its so unbalanced.
---
To add to the other comment, he also does things like trap a survivor in a corner and then go make a sandwich and then eat it on stream while laughing.
---
When you are already injured so its wasted on you : [pic](https://i.imgur.com/1jyNYtb.jpg)
---
Person doing the last gen was the subtle mvp to get you that clutch boost
---
That's like playing CTF in a shooter and saying you only need to capture the flag and not shoot anyone. Sure you're doing the objective, but you're making it a hell of a lot harder for your team. Chasing and being chased is half of the game.
---
Their fail rate is higher so it makes sense they are stronger, the fact that not everyone will do well with them makes it high risk high reward
---
Once a killer brought Shroud of Separation. That was truly surprising. I was in grey ranks from not playing though
---
Apparently wanting people to read the post before commenting is entitlement.
---
That‚Äôs typical. The moment I reached green ranks I started seeing red ranks. Rank means nothing. The match making is bad because the divided player base across different regions and ranks makes those situations perfectly normal. You will see that a lot more. It‚Äôs frustrating. You‚Äôll learn to play against it though. Every season I play I end up getting matched fucked up all the way to rank 1 and then at rank 1 it still throws low ranks in my survivor and killer lobbies. It‚Äôs either that or like I said 30 minutes wait between matches again.
---
You forgot Hybrid Panda... id rate him as Chaotic Potato.
---
Phew, I‚Äôll let you off the hook then
---
Or you could run OoO and have both perks in one
---
And it really isn't that bad as long as the killer isn't slugging or constantly pulling you off gens. Just do gens and leave.
---
I mean he is owned by the same people that own all the nightmare on elm street stuff so I am guessing it wouldn't be that far out of the question.
---
I guess, but to be honest with you if you can't notice a big red visual indicator on your screen with a skull in the middle, I don't know what to tell you : 3
---
Your comment was removed for uncivil behavior towards another user
---
But it tells the killer you can pick yourself back up! I wish it didn‚Äôt have the icon next to your gamer tag.
---
If you count breaking ruin or bringing a flashlight, sure
---
Would you believe I'm rank 6ish?
---
I play fairly often and I feel like I've been carried up the ranks much of the time...
---
But he was Ghost Face ü§®
---
How? if you work with someone else on a gen it takes 45 seconds? How is that balanced?
---
Thanks So Much!!!

Every. Fucking. Time.

There's a lot of assumptions there kid.
---
I'm sorry you hate Tyde, maybe you're jelous he's better than you since i never saw him camping or some bs, maybe you are projecting?
---
It doesn't matter, just seeing how mad you are and how many assumptions you just made make me wonder if you actually use your brain or it's just for flavour.
---
Btw nice argument, totally off topic just to reeeing against Tyde for no reason, shows pretty well your bias my dude. Next time chill out would you? Will make it so easier to have a conversation instead of seeing you cry
---
I know but why change it to square when L1 if perfectly fine even better cause you can then be more aware of your surroundings. And you don‚Äôt have to waste a perk slot.

Idk, my guess is that they decided they wanted it to be something exclusives for very old players. 
---
It does look waaay cooler tho.
---
Seeing that flashlight disappear removed all joy from this clip for me
---
I'm just glad to see he didn't make the list at all. Let him fall in to obscurity.
---
There was a topic posted 20 minutes before yours about this - maybe check that one out for more discussion.
---
i said that 3 weeks by now, i mained clown several months, its an ultra rare because that was the time that devs created weak killers, i mean, look at clown, spirit at ptb and... Legion.
---
Alot of players in dead by daylight are players that have 1000 hours or more, and i dont understand how youre making a point by that statement.
---
Caesar used to let his enemies go instead of executing them, and his enemies hated being in his debt. For those enemies, it was a fate worse than death. I like to think about that and my almighty power when I let the last person go
---
He just got what you would call "bamboozled"
---
Depending on the great skill check rate and whether someone is running prove,  they can go fast...but it requires you to run certain perks over others.
---
People are guessing the 17th
---
Which is why he loved Deathgarden so much. And then some nerfs came to hunters? I'm not sure, I stopped playing after a bit since I didn't enjoy it that much.
---
Same, the directional lullaby was what balanced her with the fact the has a ranged attack
---
They used to be bloody when you prestiged even before legacy came out, though this was rare due to the insane grind you had to go through to get the bloody clothes. 
---
This is why they made legacy, to reward the insane grind dedicated players had to go through. It should never come back because it would lose its meaning.
---
Or just leave it on L1 lmao
---
Will do, thanks.
---
&gt;I'm sorry you hate Tyde, maybe you're jelous he's better than you
---
Idk man. I never said every killer should be nurse tier, Surviviors should have the bad parts of no mither base kit, and admitted that camping is the only way I win games. And I'm like 2 pips from being a red rank nurse main. 
---
&gt;It doesn't matter, just seeing how mad you are and how many assumptions you just made make me wonder if you actually use your brain or it's just for flavour.
---
Oh the Queen's version of Flavor. Fun. 
---
&gt;Btw nice argument, totally off topic just to reeeing against Tyde for no reason, shows pretty well your bias my dude. Next time chill out would you? Will make it so easier to have a conversation instead of seeing you cry
---
Yes bc I'm the one who started making baseless assumptions
---
Bro how did you get photos of my Clown gameplay?
---
It came out on 18th of September 2018 with the shattered Bloodlines DLC, which included The Spirit, Adam Francis and the Yamaoka Family Residence.
---
Had a quick game with a couple with similar names (LadySomething and SirSomething). They ended up being the last ones alive so I let them farm, but when we started it was 5 gen and I got bored quickly. I decided I‚Äôd kill one of them halfway through after they failed a skillcheck. Post game the one that lived was all ‚ÄúTy gg!‚Äù and the other one said ‚ÄúWTF was that shit?! That‚Äôs bullshit, fuck You!‚Äù
---
I mean he still got to farm and I let his friend live so I don‚Äôt see the problem. My motto is always to only let one live and it just happened to be him. Shoulda been better and I wouldn‚Äôt have been in control.
---
Survivors can do gens and push the game super quick yes, but killers can also snowball games and end games even quicker than 5 mins.
---
I‚Äôve had games as a killer where it‚Äôs two minutes long because the survivors are playing altruistic.
---
Games are very situational, and gens getting done that quickly is a rarity and more than likely in this case it was SWF.
---
Nice repost, bud.
---
It's [CURRENT YEAR] and you're still not using commas?
---
Dead Hard
---
Muffin from asdf videos ‚ÄúBUT I WANNA DIE‚Äù
---
The usage in this particular instance may require further explanation.
---
Prestige also awards a cosmetic, up to a maximum of 3. For Claudette, this cosmetic set traditionally made her very hard to see - although it was altered recently to make it more visible.
---
The meme is that a P3 Claudette is going to work very hard to remain invisible. This can sometimes be detrimental to her team, as well as often a source of frustration to the killer - hence the desire to kill them in the rare instance that they're actually found.
---
Had a daily for Adam which was get an item and escape which I thought would be easy but lets say after 20+ tries I gave
---
Ya except 5-min games aren't fun. Super dumb.  It it's the objective of the game so.
---
i agree completely! was just saying i‚Äôve seen it work embarrassingly well at yellow and above. i‚Äôve had games where i‚Äôm on a gen and watch the killer and our designated looper run right by me and he doesn‚Äôt even smack me off the gen. major tunnel vision.
---
it doesn‚Äôt work at all when i‚Äôm in the purple/red ranks, though, obviously
---
According to steam achievements only around 10% of people have hit rank 1 once, not to mention the amount of people who actually *mantain* rank 1 is even less than the amount who just hit it once.
---
Rank 1 players are a minority, and while their should be stuff to keep them busy (Nurse, Spirit, DS, Dead Hard), the entire game should not be balanced around them
---
I use the teabag for saying "thank you" after being healed or "hi" at the beginning of the game so much that I have to remind myself sometimes that the killer may take offense.  
---
I've actually teabagged nice killers, who are letting me escape, to try and say "thank you" only to realize after the game that they might actually have taken it the wrong way.  Feels bad man.
---
What?
---
Just so I can scratch my face, basically. I‚Äôve started using other perks besides Spine Chill and am doing some builds I may want to try with Nancy‚Äôs as I‚Äôm going full Nancy when she releases. 
---
In the end, personally for me it feels better and I‚Äôm getting adjusted to my surroundings as if I still had it on L1. The skill check happens for a brief moment and I can go back to moving my camera around with ease. Just need a bit more practice with stealth killers as non stealthy ones are easy to get ready for.
---
Still if they're trying to 4k and slug to do you can just keep getting back up meaning he either has to hook ya or allow you to keep doing jt
---
Had this happen to me. Killer and me farmed for a bit, the he killed me.
---
*gets stunned*
---
*ballon deflation noises*
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre quite grasping this so I‚Äôll say it again for you
---
I've been playing trapper lately. Enduring, ruin, BBQ +1 either make your choice or spirit fury. 
---
I can record a day of playing. I would link my last stream but it's full of me whining about pallets for about two hours lol.
---
Haha it means all that blood on you is an aphrodisiac to killers
---
I did this yesterday. Had two players drop immediately after seeing I was Spirit with beads. Let the other two farm all the BP they could then they just wouldn't leave.
---
If it's Rank 20, then they are likely new - everyone has to learn the game at some point.
---
As a side note, if I saw your aura doing the attempt escape motion while you were on the hook and I didn't hear heartbeats myself, I'd be inclined to leave you there, as that's how people signal that the killer is camping.
---
You don't rank up or double pip at least,which is a gain imo
---
Good day to everyone except the mf that posted this
---
I don't know what the comment was above this one but yeah, killers DCing over this is sad and pathetic. Also when survivors get downed fairly early on, or really anyone DCing for anything other than a bad connection (or an actual emergency irl).
---
Watch me whip this out in the bedroom.
---
Just make chaotic evil a super square. This community probably has enough people to fill it.
---
I did my videos just with english subtitles but I don't see anything wrong with Spanish language and English subtitles.
---
Wait wait wait: your telling me that killers can talk to survivors in the end screen? Oh nice. PC only?
---
I know it's not your intention, but people knowing the username opens this player up to brigades, cyberbullying/stalking, or whatever else. We just want to err on the side of caution to protect all player's privacy, toxic or not.
---
Yes, okay youre making some valid points but the survivors have to play really bad for the killer to be able to snowball that quickly, and even then its really rare. But on the other hand we see Tru playing as clown he does do a few mistakes but he they werent really that detromental in my opinion, he played pretty decent and still gens flew by. 
---
SWF, its a huge problem. I think you should know if they are a survive with friends, or you get some bonuses as a killer if youre playing against a SWF.
---
And you dont have self care and that's not what it looks like and I'm on console to ps4 and you can turn up your sens and your low rank and again you teabag
---
I wouldn't consider it a crutch perk but without shadowborn I feel so damn restricted with my vision and when I play other killers that don't have it i just get bugged by it. For actual crutch perks I would say bond because I don't bring self care often and I can find where my teammates are and thrilling tremors as I get genrushed without it, 16 seconds may seem like not alot but it sure helps quite a ton as every second counts
---
Haha I'm sat watching nation z and this could have been addys pike
---
When I tried urban evasion killers would hear the grass and find me anyways.

That got Myers dead hard ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Slendermyers?
---
Oh I know but I just deal with it plus it barely happens to me so I don't care that much
---
Every one of my builds has Adrenaline unless I'm going for an Adept achievement. It lets me worry about gens during the later stages of the game without taking the time to heal. It also lets me take an extra late hit while blocking or running for the escape.
---
I also feel handicapped without Balanced Landing. I try to take it off every now and then, but always throw it back on after a couple matches.
---
Yea seriously. Even at rank 1 there‚Äôs always at least one per game running it.
---
Hopefully they switch it back at some point
---
Ever since I got iron will I cannot play without it, it‚Äôs insurance for spirit but it works well against other killers too.
---
I never claimed it wasn't large. I view it the same as I view sports. I couldn't tell you who was on what teams in what sport unless they are like a huge deal. And even then I don't know what they look like. Same applies here.
---
Please censor usernames in the future. Thank you.
---
Oh I abuse Legion on them. Hit them with Frenzy right before they open the gate then as the tea-bag walk around a corner and stab them if they walk past me.
---
I end up doing this every time I‚Äôm SWF. I‚Äôll find the Hex right off the bat, and I **know** there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs ruin with my luck. I‚Äôll hear ‚ÄúWait, it‚Äôs Spirit! Don‚Äôt do it, don‚Äôt do it, I swear to God!‚Äù  I do it anyways, and they go down right after. At least we got it out of the way, right?! :D
---
I get a lot better by playing against better people. I don't have to sit through boring ass baseball games to get better at base ball. Practice makes perfect.
---
Bond. MedKit. Adrenaline. DS.

Don‚Äôt run SC and don‚Äôt waste the teams time.

---
**Make 2 crows go caw**
---
(7 games in and no progress made)
---
I don‚Äôt have self care because I was running a certain build to run and distract the killer while the others get gens and I relied on my friends who were Claudettes to heal me up when I needed it after chases and also I didn‚Äôt t bag for the 30th time. My trigger gets stuck and I have to press it twice to fix it and it looks like I tbag even though I don‚Äôt do it at all. So how about you read the other comments that has context before you talk shit
---
Not
---
That‚Äôs my point. It‚Äôs tells the killer ‚Äúhey hook me, so I can‚Äôt use my perk‚Äù.
---
That‚Äôs cool.

*sees doctor in bottom tier*

#are you sure about that
---
Spine chill. i just need to be sure if the killer is heading my way or not. if someone is in a chase i get faster repair speed too if the killer just glances my direction. plus it kind of counters wraith, spirit and other steath killers for me. exepct tier 1 micheal though.
---
"I JUST DIIIIEEEEEDDDD IN YOUR ARMS TONIGHT!!!"
---
Killers need to get good and learn how to slow down the game. 
---
Patrol hook, tunnel, slug, injure and leave survivors. The game is very easy for killers if they know what they are doing.
---
That's 100% true. I know he means well but like in every game, once u see negativity it hurts a little and take out the fun in watching. I only watch his streams but nvr his youtube contents cuz the chances of me seeing him upload ranty videos is higher than watching the stream itself.
---
It happens to me fairly often but I've just gotten used to it by now.
---
Yeah I've deffiently been fucked over by a Micheal who was farming but was sitting on a tombstone. I went up to him like "hey hit me" right after the gens were done and that bitch tombstones me. I felt so betrayed.
---
?
---
If you open an insanely large amount of tabs in Google it goes from displaying the number of tabs to just displaying ":D"
---
Does that not ruin the game? Being forced to run certain killers or perks just isn't fun all the time.
---
r/uselessnobody

If that was the case top players would all be playing "hard champions", but its not the case. Many easier champions are played at top levels.

Okay, but where are you getting your numbers from? youre aware that DBD has been free a couple of times right? That will scew the numbers heavily.
---
You stood there and teenaged in the direction of the killer and pointed at him and you have urban evasio  and relentless thos are perks for being sneaky and doing gens I'm just saying you look someone who isn't that good
---
They didn't. The bloody clothes were always the standard reward, players simply got a legacy version of every prestiege cosmetic they had in november 2016.
---
3k bp tho
---
My point was that this meme seems to imply that there are people who believe that this community can‚Äôt be toxic, which I‚Äôve never heard someone say that
---
I just got it by kept playing with her over and over until i got half decent as the nurse and got lucky by grabbing three. You will get it if you just keep grinding away.
---
tbh If I cleanse haunted ground I'm taking one for the team and looping that bitch as best I can before getting decked.
---
well looks like someone was smart enough to leave earlier
---
But the thing is you dont understand, the killer HAS to go ruin, survivors doesnt need to go Prove thyself...
---
Shadowborn is literally the definition of a crutch perk imo. Crutch perk essentially is a perk that isn't meta but you like to run since it really makes up for a personnal weakness of yours.
---
spirit, doctor is too daddy to be afraid of
---
The survivors don‚Äôt have to even play poorly for a killer to snowball, it‚Äôs just situational. And like I said it‚Äôs a rarity games like that happen.
---
Same with survivors doing 5 gens in 5 minutes, it‚Äôs a rarity.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt balance things around rarity.
---
Tru3 puts out lots of videos everyday where he plays killer which I‚Äôm sure you know. 9/10 times hes 3/4k‚Äôing the survivors.
---
The 1 video where the survivors actually play optimally shouldn‚Äôt be the deciding factor of balance.
---
Also I think we can agree something needs to be done about SWF, it‚Äôs the strongest thing in this game bar none.
---
My personal suggestion for tuning down SWF is actually giving them a debuff to gen speed.
---
...what
---
Alert. Call me a noob but I feel so much safer knowing where the killer is.
---
d strike. saves me so many times.
---
Didn't say they did, but people in these comments and in another post are unironically agreeing with this mentality, same for the mori all ttv people. It's toxic as fuck
---
This. Very much this.
---
Don't be salty, try to ignore the people that send you mean messages.
---
I lost all my survivors yesterday because of it smh
---
Once you enter semi-decent ranks, you cannot do a ritual with a killer you're not familiar/good with, otherwise you just get stomped, had to do Huntress and Plague rituals today which weren't fun
---
Also a good tip that i don't see very often is if you know the killer is going to hit you through a pallet do not drop it and rather just take the hit and either loop the pallet or run to another window/pallet
---
That's me 90% of the time because if someone gets downed when the exit gates are open I'm out I'm not getting trapped inside the map especially if they have a NOED
---
I'm a big fan of the master of combos perk
---
I mostly do it for the speed boost on top of pwyf stacks tbh

Really though lmao

It could always commission these if it wasn't too hard to make

First time posting here but I excluded what didn't seem necessary. I may also be late to sharing this :p
---
* *Platform:* Either PC
---
* *Type of Bug:* In Game
---
* *Description:* When playing as Jake and I am getting hooked for a second time, the struggle starts the moment I am placed on the hook. I noticed that other survivors don't experience this? I feel like this is a bug but unsure if anyone else has seen this.
---
* *Screenshot / Video:* N/A but if asked I can record one later on once I am home
---
* *Expected result:* When playing as other survivors I noticed that I have about 3-5 seconds to prepare to struggle
---

---
* *System Specs (PC only):* N/A
---
EXCUSE ME, but [mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cp8d9v/optimal_use_of_roulette_build/) is clearly the superior use here.
---
What game is this?
---
Pretty sure it's why I had a half your arm wresting contest in that game.
---
It does ruin the game in my opinion. Which is why I don't play much anymore. Can still be fun with friends though.
---
Sometimes sacrifices have to be made
---
Exactly the same. I find I can lose the killer so much easier when I'm not screaming like a baby.
---
Sure. I wouldn't have posted it without if it was actually mean tho.
---
Ahaha i do that
---
Dude the problem in trapper is that they will finish the gens too fast. Till you got all palets gone and placed your traps, they will be finished. Its because the trapper got really bad mad pressure.
---
Where‚Äôs sexy hexy?
---
Why did you not use Noob3‚Äôs face?
---
That was all of us at one point, so why be an asshole to him?

I rather have a normie then you lmao

I can feel ur pain,im rank 12 killer and got  rank 2 ,4,8,16 survivors with 3 decisive and 1 instaheal

Tofu?

Bond. As someone who doesn‚Äôt play with people I can‚Äôt hear i.e. randoms, its very easy to tell where my friends are when they need me for something
---
Love By Daylight
---
I love that show so much
---
I legit do the exact opposite of that, I stay put when the killer is near and wave my arms around when hes gone lol
---
Dude was rank 3 but lol
---
Well, the Human *is* an animal. Animals tend to make loud noises when excited.
---
He wasn't new so
---
No thanks, I paid for the game and I'll play the game how I want. Self care is the best perk in the game for a solo player hands down. Thanks for you input though :)
---
I see you're a man of shirtless too
---
I thought he looked farmilar
---
Oh and the bill was afk the whole time if you didn't see his aura back there
---
I know who Jason is, the one who don‚Äôt feel pain, brutally strong (brutal strength), makes people panic around him and free in horror no matter what they are doing (unnerving presence), who gets more and more aggressive the more you run away from him, the more you tempt him the more brutal he gets (agitation). A seven foot tall, strong killer? Just like the trapper :)  I know there is a lot to touch upon with Jason, but he would be a lot like the trapper. Even the bear traps kinda fit him, since he kills with them, and even places traps around the places. He is a hunter, at a forest camp, he acts a lot like the trapper, all down to the traps, just.. not named Jason.
---
I still suggested that the killer is assisted by other  ai controlled legion.
---
Well he is the ultimate example of a walking brick, so maybe can destroy vault locations and pallets? it sounds OP, but its Jason, he kinda should be
---
I meant broken good. Sorry brother.
---
Well I can and did
---
its happened to me before figured that the bug was because the nurse was in fatigue so she couldn't be stunned
---
The cornfields are our lord and savior.
---
I feel like Gordon Freeman is an odd choice for the next killer... But I guess they have their own plans
---
Im a billy main and have been for a while and its not even close, nurse can literally annihilate with any skill involved, billy can snowball but nurse is just unbeatable because her skill cap is so high and theres an infinite amount of potential
---
wow that's awesome! wish they had it for ps4!
---
HAHHAHA YES!!
---
Sounds like old man syndrome is setting in early for you
---
Well of course. And we know we will never get Jason because even F13 the game is dealing with a lawsuit. So we dont even know at this point. But yeah, trapper is just very much like Jason. Even has a machete
---

Pebble OP
---
Cute how people judge a gameplay instead of the overall problem of games going too quickly.
---
I legit finish a game in 3-5 min in either side, only when I find potatoes then it goes slower but usually it goes too fast. Idk about other regions but in EU if you have a match that last longer than 5min from rank 13 to 1 then you're pretty lucky
---
Well leta say he is not the trapper. Make him different. There are several ways he could be done. I dont want him as a slow killer. This game is all about loops and being able to end them as quick as the killer can. Some do it better than others while some are too good (Nurse). In friday the 13th game he was an op Spirit, Night Crawler from xmen and a stationary Huntress. He could also walk through walls if/as he destroyed them. Damage vault locations so survivors would get damaged if vaulted and place bear traps. 
---
Probably could do more but he was this unrelenting killer in the films that was slow but always end up behind a survivor when they turned around.
---
All that he isn't even close to being the trapper. Just need to pick the best representation but with freddy it's possible to change powers with add ons. So whose to say he cant have several powers if done correctly.
---
R6S DLC? holy shit!
---
????? I‚Äôm against just renaming the Trapper buddy sorry but I nearly had a seizure reading this I never brought up Michael Myers I bought up how people said Legion is the same as GhostFace so we don‚Äôt need GhostFace AND THE SAME THING GOES FOR TRAPPER AND JASON yeah let‚Äôs just fucking Retcon the Trappers Lore for no reason and call him Jason that‚Äôs totally not lazy and actually gets rid of an entire characters lore and story people want Jason to be his own character not just some old character changed to be him
---
Kinda bull it triggers on killers in "Stealth mode"
---
YAY...WAIT WHAT THE FU**
---
He's immune to it now when he is cloaked. I believe all the stealth killers are on ptb
---
No you are wrong.
---
He rarely used bear traps in the films. Just saying.
---
Does noed not work through borrowed time?
---
You can‚Äôt say that for sure. Because he wasn‚Äôt low rank? I‚Äôve let a few of my friends and family members play a match on my high rank account when they see me play and wanna try it out. Sound like you were just being a petty asshole.
---
Some people don't have the B's to level up a a fat cannibal they're never gonna play
---
Wait killers give hatches still? What rank does this happen and how do I get there? All I get is BM hibly players :(
---
Stypic powder is good for healing brute damage
---
It goes good in a patch since it heals damage instant and over time
---
Here's the recipe for your chem dispenser 
---
Brute Patch (100u): aluminium=25;hydrogen=25;oxygen=25;sacid=25
---
I‚Äôm not saying just rename him, my point is just that 90% of him is allready in the game, with the trapper who clearly is highly inspired by him. 
---
so I highly doubt he will get added, without even talking about Friday the 13th the game and all the legal stuff.
---
yeah I think it downloads it in chunks then takes ten or so minutes to validate files then gets the next chunk and so on, so even though it's. like a 700mb download it takes 30ish minutes to do
---
I mean sacrifice one or two and you‚Äôve gone even which the ideal balanced fun game as far as both sides is concerned would be that
---
Hey this is really good but it‚Äôs not a spongebob meme so sorry you only get 2k karma
---
noob is unfunny, boring, and the original unoriginal DbD player (clickbait my videos, they have my girlfriend in them) 
---
true is a pompous crybaby with 0 introspective criticism toward his own gameplay (clickbait my videos, they have my girlfriend in them) 
---
monto is fine. at least he experiments with builds, and is a decent killer.
---
I mean a solid two days of playing gets someone to lv 40, it isn't THAT hard. The main problem would actually be if they don't have the DLC
---
He looks AMAZING
---
Survivors coming out from the hatch? That's new
---
Fucking duh,it's in the title

* Rule 5: Buying, selling, trading of any kind is prohibited
---
what i mean is if you read the post you'd see im not crying for spirit nerfs. I'm complaining that having to run x perk to even remotely stand a chance is unhealthy. I made suggestions for changes with spirits phase walk, as well as buffs to compensate for those changes.
---
sure you can make the argument that "m1 killers have to run stbfl or enduring +SF" or "every killer has to have ruin to stand a chance" but agreeing with me and then saying but its ok because ruin is also a problem doesn't take the discussion anywhere. 
---
Ruin being an issue doesn't make other issues acceptable, neither does iron will in relation to others.
---
Well I got away and got 32k from the match so Im doing just fine
---
And yet it exists
---
I‚Äôm aware. You said ‚Äúmay or may not.‚Äù I was just confirming it for you.
---
Yeah you know who else was highly inspired by a certain Slasher Hillbilly but we still got Leather Face but let‚Äôs look at your argument first off 1 movie in the Friday the 13th franchise had Jason using bear traps as a main point also you said the perks are similar to Jason but literally the examples you gave could be given to any strong and big Slasher also the poster asked what power would Jason have if he was put in the game I don‚Äôt think he was looking for people saying we have ‚ÄúTrapper and he‚Äôs like Jason‚Äù the whole point of the ops post was to give ideas off Jason was added
---
There's a surprising amount of hate here for flashlights when they're easily the most counterable tool in the game. A lobby of flashlights means they're not bringing instas or stacked toolboxes, and that's a good thing.
---
It sounds like a cool idea to me! I'm sure that others will disagree but it sounds pretty legit!
---
To me he's the only one doing gens
---
It doesn't really matter what you do, the end result is what matters. If you win they WILL complain, if you lose, they will likely say stuff like "EZ PZ".
---
The other day i crushed a survivor team with Billy and there is literally nothing they could have complained about. Always instantly left hooks to go to my BBQ reveal and there was 0 tunneling. But none of them was good so i was easily really fast. They were so pissed and said "WTF DO U THINK THIS WAS FUN? WHY PLAY LIKE THAT?".
---
I'm definitely not necessarily a higher rank, but I'm rank 10 right now and I frequently get matched with rank 20-18 killers, along with the occasional red rank survivor.  I feel bad for them sometimes.
---
I straight up broke a legion today.  I dropped 3 pallets on his head and got away from him twice while most of the gens got done. After that last chase, I saw him just start slashing at a random generator for a couple solid minutes.
---
Then there was a doc today who I'm pretty sure had never even played the game before.  He was a rank 20 and didn't seem to even learn how to use his shock therapy until the very end of the game.  He used it one time.
---
I‚Äôm still getting my feet wet with all the different killers that are now in Dbd since the last time I played. Why is it bad to cleanse after the Plague vomits on you?
---
I‚Äôm saying that it won‚Äôt be that hard first off Trapper is not that much like Jason he‚Äôs a big guy with a machete and a mask and that‚Äôs where the comparisons stop so it would not be hard in the slightest he‚Äôs an immortal zombie dude I think it would be pretty easy to make him different then Trapper I mean they did it with leather Face and Hillbilly and those two are almost the same character basically and yet they both have very different abilities even though they both use chainsaws
---
Sorry

What the actual fuck was those movements

It's always Meg

Mad cuz bad

No one:

r/iamverysmart:

She probably thought it was the ruin too, killers can‚Äôt see which hex is which
---
spirit was also released weak af, then she got buffed at mid chapter patch, when the devs released GF and Plague, they try to make better killers but Plague ended up being boring and GF is amazing but not freddy level, Demogorgon is great, so this year the devs actually are trying to make good killers, but in 2018, all killers released were weak and then they got buffed.
---
That wasn‚Äôt genuine, I play mostly killer and I play mostly Ghostface and I can‚Äôt fathom why the FUCK you play Ghostface to camp when Wraith is so much better at it, since you can stand literally touching the person and nobody knows while Ghostface has to hide somewhere nearby.
---
Are you infering i'm mad through reddit comments?
---
The fact that this is making you psychoanalyze my comments means this clearing bugs you alot more,and thats a fuckin' yikes my guy.
---
I mean he's been playing since the game first released so he's probably just is really good with his movements allowing him to do that
---
I had it opening the gates too. Instant karma.

The bloodweb grind to prestige back in the day was like 10x harder. It took a lot of Bloodpoints and grind to even prestige once. The people that did prestige back in the day still only got the normal bloody clothes. BHVR later on decided to nerf the grind because it was just way too long and tedious to what it is now. And the people that went through the grind back in the day now have the Legacy clothes.
---
*reddit user u/sCratchThatButt posted*
---
‚ÄúWow uh...Can I fuck him too?‚Äù
---
There's so many power and perk suggestions that I'm not even gonna try. As for how he'd get here, you could trick him into the realm by making a copy of Crystal Lake or use his mother's voice to draw him in. Or just show him the survivors and he'll come ~~running~~ walking.
---
Yeah, so what can we do within the game, to make Jason different? All the killers are immortal in the game, since survivors can‚Äôt fight back. So that‚Äôs not something we can play with or use in anyway as a game mechanic, so if we remove that? Since it can only be a cosmetic thing, and story, it won‚Äôt effect the game. It gets really hard making them different. 
---
Hillbilly don‚Äôt have any aspect of leatherfaces, childish, and rage filled personality, that we see in leatherface, nor does hillbilly‚Äôs moans and groans sound like leatherfaces very unique sounds, that you see strongly in leatherface when he misses the chainsaw, or when you hit a survivor during a rush.
---
I always hear people say that but if you dont mind me Asking how was it so much more challenging?
---
I'd much rather play vs the best nurse than vs the best billy.
---
You also need to remember that even in red ranks 99.9% of all nurses are awful, making nurse much easier to deal with than a decent, Billy. A decent nurse is useless. A decent Billy is devastating.
---
Legion???
---
We out here!
---
He was also abusing exploits in the game.
---
And even if this isn't as bad as the other things, he was a toxic asshole.
---
*Switches to Nurse*
---
That's why I always do a quick check around me before picking any one up anymore. I learned that lesson when I had to slug an entire SWF.
---
Well I mean. He went from doing a 360 to like clipping into a perfect moonwalk. Looks weird af
---
I love all the stealth killers and the movies they come from (Other than Scream) and I love Leatherface a shit ton, so I'd have to say the Doctor. Or definitely one of the killers that were born evil. Most of the killers turned evil.
---
Let‚Äôs see first off Jason has been shown to teleport around the world he has a connection to mist and water and OH WAIT we literally have two video games where he a playable character Mortal Kombat X which isn‚Äôt that useful in making him and we also have Friday the 13th in which he has plenty of ability‚Äôs I‚Äôm sure they could find a way to translate one of his abilities into DBD I mean give him a must teleport maybe give him an ability where he can walk through pallets and vault spits destroying them temporarily maybe he can grab survivors by the neck or something
---
I'll admit i'm always surprised when a killer lets me live, or at the very least i'm on edge when i see them there doing nothing.
---
Everything in the blood web was 1k to 2k higher. BP offerings gave less bp. Started at  25%, 50% and 75%
---
No 2 perks in bloodweb. Bloodwebs could at times be much larger and sometimes be so large the entity would take your perk before you even reached it. I'm sure that's not all.
---
Gen rushing is not real in the way that you think. It‚Äôs simply the notion of how fast gens are done. If you don‚Äôt bring Ruin, you‚Äôre fucked. If they‚Äôre a four-man SWF all with green/purple toolboxes, you‚Äôre fucked. If you get looped for 2 or 3 gens, guess what? You‚Äôre fucked. BHVRhas tried to fix this issue, but nothing has worked. I remember I once played Nurse (still learning the ropes of Nurse), and I got matched with 4 guys in red and purple ranks even though I was only rank 16. I didn‚Äôt have Ruin for my Nurse yet ona count of how many other teachable I have. The round was over in about 3 minutes. Not one person was downed. That pretty much sums up the whole issue.
---
Well the F13 game no longer has the liscence to Jason or technically anything that was in the original film whatsoever 
---
So maybe now that that's all been settled?
---
Oh hey, the 4th one is through the eyes of Loomis.
---
The game was waay buggy, infinits were a thing, and the bloodwebs were crazy, i wanted to prestige everyone and despite how much i played i managed 4 killers and 3 survivors, and all just prestige 1 except nurse and wraith. 
---
The grind sucked
---
I can do that right back at them as Ghostface
---
Hia I make costumes as a side business. I really don't know if anyone would make a statue for under 65 unless they have already made a 3d model for printing or they have already made one in the past that they want to sell. The time that goes into making a detailed statue can be more time than it takes to make a prop sword or mask.
---
Remember kids, if you DC, you‚Äôre scum. There are very few exceptions to this rule, and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre adding temp bans when dedicated servers come out.
---
My thoughts for Jason was as follows:
---
He has a passive power called rage, where it builds up slowly over time and gets more from stuns, being blinded, losing a survivor from his shoulder or losing a chase (perhaps requires a certain amount of chase time to negate cheesing). Once full he can bash through a wall. For easier coding perhaps instead he destroys windows. This should be able to proc a few times per match. 
---
He also can search through a locker to grab a random weapon. This weapon changes his base stats based off the weapon. Not sure exactly how it would work balance wise but likely each weapon would last for 1 hit only but be better than normal. For example a spear has very good lunge range. A smaller weapon increases his speed by a small amount. A large axe has a cleave like leatherface‚Äôs chainsaw. A brutal weapon is a one shot weapon, etc. I would imagine there would be a cool down on getting new weapons. Could make it really interesting and could pull out throwing knives (have 3 or so, act like huntress axes) or even brew traps (get 2, work just like trappers). 
---
This would make him a very versatile killer that has counters (knowing the weapons and how to avoid them, avoiding stunning him, etc)
---
Don't see why people are downvoting you. It's your opinion. Some of these people are childish.
---
Lol imagine being terrified to do anything
---
Noob hasn‚Äôt done that in a looooong time
---
Well yeah but waiting until a guy gets injured in chase is the best thing to do still. 
---
Better 1 stack of DH than Haunted Grounds
---
Someone was complaining that this sub is full of shitty memes, I told them yes there are shitty ones but we also have a lot of high quality OC.
---
This, this is what I was referring to
---
Whats your point
---
Was thinking this yesterday when I watched IT for the first time. What would his power be? I feel like he‚Äôd have to have a sort of rush ability kind of like the Demo, but he just rushes with his mouth open. Maybe he sets balloons that pop when people are close and give a notification? Seems kinda underpowered. And if you let him TP to them he‚Äôs just a better hag. Maybe some type of illusion power that can trick survivors.
---
No worries! Just taking precautions. :)
---
This is what I do with all new characters:  play someone else with the perks I want, then put the points into the newbies.  
---
I don't get why people do it any other way.  Why would you want to play a character that's basically handicapped?
---
Thanks I'll keep that in mind. I don't play that regularly so I need to try to remember more tricks.

You realize he wasnt trying to hit you right? Either that or he really is a rank 20

You are supposed to sometimes stand still as wraith

Just because it isn‚Äôt wise to do so doesn‚Äôt mean you never should, they have their uses.

The huntress uses hatchets, not the clown
---
Thats hag dumbass
---
While I have never played as him, I can tell you from a survivor perspective the Ghostface's that do the best agaisnt me are the ones that pretty much only stalk while leaning behind cover
---
God please no, holding m1 is the most boring part of the game, increasing gen time is not a healthy solution. They really need to introduce a second objective, something to make survivors explore the map risking to bump into a killer (like looking for a gen parts of a fuel for it), it would prolong the game and also result in a much more dynamic gameplay for both sides.
---
No because I don‚Äôt think that counts as a stun
---
Killer don‚Äôt get much points unless he hooks, mate.
---
He really was a rank 20 and he had no perks on and I checked is stats and he has about an hour into the game and he wasn‚Äôt on a throwaway profile because he had an insanely high gamerscore  so then I invited him to a party and played a custom game with him and teaching him about builds and scratch marks and looping and all that.
---
Its okay i do not care about downvotes.
---
Would you not agree that most of the player base are between rank 4-8? 
---
Most of the playerbase in dead by daylight are high ranks and do have alot of knowledge about the game.
---
I dont understand what the problem with testing changes, spice it up.

Where is my man fungoose at?  made me a red rank killer!

Yet, simply yelling to express excitement seems to be relatively common.
---
Lmao grabbed by wraith
---
Prayer beads spirit with yoink builds and hag traps when you don't expect them are bad as well.
---
Rank 20 survivors **also** be like: not wiggling so the killer can take you to basement for free.
---
He *might* have still made it but if he had gotten pushed into a wall on the way there you may have slipped out. Plus if you're wiggling he might not have even attempted it given how far it was.
---
...possible crossover?
---
No because that isn't a pallet stun, that's a weapon hitting a surface stun. Still a good perk as you can lunge at survivors near pallets and they are forced to drop and you may still get a hit in.
---
OMG, why don't I know about this game!? It looks fucking awesome.
---
No
---
I‚Äôm most likely going to make a future post going into more detail on an idea I‚Äôve had, and I‚Äôve got a backstory I‚Äôm sure some of you might like. Stay tuned.

Works like tier 1 Michael I think
---
God I wish so

It's such a bizarre thing to happen. I guess with the fps dropping right down to 1 or 2 perhaps that's more likely the issue. I'm no expert but can't you check the memory in the command console or bios to at least rule that out?

Your dick doesn't have legs???
---
&gt;Nice story bruh, too bad nobody said that, neither Tyde. 
---
Yes he did. I also specifically remember him saying that the infantry belt nerf that prevented her from having 5 one shotting hatchets with I head completely killed Huntresses viability. He constantly fostered the mindset among killer mains that they are some oppressed minority and that BHVR and evil survivor main Ochido fanboys constantly nerf killers while buffing Surviviors. He's back from deathgarden for nothing more than the money he can get out of DBD, said Demi Logorgon is trash bc he isn't Nurse (even tho his portals literally let him tunnel harder than a Mint Rag Hag so he's probably right up Tydes alley), and called Freddy's gen teleport garbage bc he can't use it as a chase tool or catch Surviviors off guard with it. He's a killer main who wants the game balanced around 4ks, he always has been.
---
Yeah I see it all too much. Me a rank 1 with my friend a rank 1 and my other friend a rank 4 surely we‚Äôll get a killer and teammate at least KINDA close to our ranks right? Right? No? Aww :(
---
Well, some of them do ü§£
---
Mine would probably be discordance. Without it i would never find anyone. I might replace it with bbq and chilli once i get it on Pig.
---
kinda
---
Plus, if you manage to hit them with a lunge and then get stunned, more often than not you end up on the other side of the pallet next to the survivor. With Enduring you can either 180 swipe to cover them vaulting back over the pallet or just chase them down for a clean double hit, and you don't even have to invest the extra perk slot for Spirit Fury.
---
when he did, it was just copying the trend of true doing it, as well as Tyde? 
---
I dont know. i watch streamers for interesting gameplay. I dont get that from them.
---
The question is what is with brutal strength? Does it affect it? I bet no. I'm on console so I can't know
---
Yeah and I made the same argument for other things. Plus iron will works on every killer.. is that hard to read? I know what you want, I just find it silly since there are way worse problems
---
My friends kid always does have my back running in on those unhooks tho, this rank reset she got to 17 now though. So proud ^^

Good question

Killer tips:
---
1. NEVER run to your Hex: Ruin at the beginning of a game...it‚Äôs random how it spawns but if it spawns one time on the right spot you gain so much time 
---
2. If you‚Äôre chasing a survivor and see that he‚Äôs too good at looping break the chase and go for other survivors or you are wasting to much time...you will get him later for sure 
---
3. NEVER change the direction if you get looped at a looping spot where you can‚Äôt mindgame the survivor
---
4. Don‚Äôt be a dick to survivors...it‚Äôs just a fucking game...just play it and have fun
---
It is still the biggest killer troll for me lol
---
It‚Äôs not like They‚Äôre breaking the rules of the game to get more bloodpoints, so the non farmer is doing nothing wrong. You can kill them sure but if I‚Äôm on the recieving end and you hook me, I‚Äôll just let myself die on phase 2 (because I know you‚Äôre gonna farm me for hooks) so I can find another match. I would do things like break totems, snatch goodies and waste them, remove nearby hooks, etc. to deny your farming, but I won‚Äôt because you all agreed to it together to farm and I‚Äôm the only one who don‚Äôt wanna farm.
---
The flashlight is a deadly laser.

Sure buddy, look if you don't like Tyde for some idiotic reasons I don't care. You got off topic for no reason just to bitch about him, strawmaning his points and demonizing him and honestly I can't care less

Hate the logic of mid-ranks saying ‚Äúhaha you de-pip lol‚Äù despite the fact that is a pretty good thing, less likely to run into big brain time god tier perk loadout killers and survivors.
---
I usually just tell them I don‚Äôt care about ranking, just having fun, and if de-pipping means easier opponents, who am I to deny myself an easy and fun encounter?
---
Yes, sure. You see, in my experience the worst examples of "gen rushing" happen when two survivors simply spawn on a gen and start working on it immidiately. Usually it results in gens popping before the killer even finds anyone. This should not be the case, survivors should've be able to start banging gens as soon as they load into the game, they need to explore the map for a bit first imo.
---
Where is the king of DBD Sal\_gu?
---
What about killer that can trap chests and lockers. Imagine a chest that could grab a person like in dark souls.
---
NICE!!!!
---
Yeah, Gens are definitely way too easy. Me and 2 mates had 3 Gens done in basically 2 minutes here recently against a trapper üòÇ like there's just nothing you can do unless you get lucky with ruin  or the survivors are utterly incompetent.
---
He would be completely broken lol

One killer is hard enough to go against. If theres 2 Legions breaking survivors people would DC
---
I‚Äôm in America
---
Yea but there are particular ways you run those killers.
---
Tbh yea lol that's about it
---
skillchecks should work like overcharge where it follows you off of the gen
---
True, but when i think of ideas for game, i think the enjoyability for those against it more so then those who use it. I can't help my self to not think about the overall enjoyment of it. Like one of the reasons i dislike the spirit as a killer, its because it removes some aspects from the sruviviers, just like the nurse. but yeah, might just be overly glentle about it all :).    
---
People allready call sprit fury, brainless and boring to play against. I could see the same issue. 
---
The grabbing survivers, seem like a very good mor. Knock them to the ground, grag them back to you, and fuck them up?  But yeah, there is alot to do with Jason, expecially with animaltion, or maybe even lack off animation. But anyhow, was a nice debate :) Its time for me to head to bed :) have a lovely evening!
---
I get anxiety if I don't play with whispers lol
---
I‚Äôll check him out. Thanks. I have a tight schedule so I don‚Äôt get to watch a lot of twitch. But when I do, it‚Äôs so cringe, like yesterday. Everyone wants to be important and famous and right and an influencer in 2019, even when it comes to video games.
---
Well it wasnt really skill, doing gens does not take any skill whatsoever. 
---
It was just gen speed was to high.

I played as david first as well dead hard was the best perk for a noob
---
Ghostface main here, I'll share some of the big tips I have for him.
---
So first off how his power works: when you go into his power, both his red stain and terror radius (heartbeat) completly dissapear. You get knocked out of his power by either swinging (doesn't matter if you miss or hit) or having a survivor look at you to reveal you. One thing to note is that once you get up to about 80% revealed (you can tell by the sound effect), going completely behind cover won't stop you from being revealed the rest of the way. Idk if this is a bug or how it's supposed to work, but that's just the way it is. Also, since survivors have 3rd person, they can reveal you without you being able to see/ stalk them so keep that in mind too. 
---
Now for some theory on how to play him: Ghostface has individual stalk meters for each survivor. In a perfect world, your strategy is to stalk every survivor up to 99%. This lets you use your power to sneak up and expose them while right next to them, then you get a free instadown. 
---
 the first thing to understand is that comp
---
leting a stalk is roughly equivalent to hitting them one time. If a survivor is trying to reveal you, it's often better to just let them knock you out of your power and use the fact that they are out of position to get a smack, since hiding back behind cover isn't a guarantee that it will even save you from being knocked out cause of the bug I described above. The only thing is that hitting a survivor will reset their stalk meter. So if you have a survivor at 99% it might actually be better to just leave them and wait for your power to come back for a free instadown.
---
Sleep. Only Dreams now.
---
I saw that post immediately after commenting that lol
---
Ah yes, you're the toxic survivor that ruins the game for people, nice. I imagine you probably then go stomp your feet and complain the second you get destroyed üòÇ
---
human plague could sit on my face anyday
---
Doesn‚Äôt sound bad, unfortunately like you said, teleporting is overdone
---
With Freddy, you can sneak up on them, vanish until they are in your vicinity, have blood warden, fake pallets, blood pools to end chases, M1 that extends about 7 feet forward. All while everything is dark, gloomy and blurry bc of nightmare state. If someone doesn‚Äôt win as Freddy, its slightly on them.

&gt;Quick Play/Free Play I mostly play for fun and some occasional achievement hunting. I don‚Äôt want to ruin the game for folks trying to climb competitive ranks and often playing against people who wanna play very aggressively takes the fun out of the game from both the killer and survivor side(if that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre wanting at the time). When I play Killer I enjoy spending more time scaring the crap out of survivors than just trying to win. As a survivor I love playing a stealthy game and trying to stay out of sight where I can. These things make the game feel more like a horror game/movie to me but they‚Äôre easily wrecked by aggressive players just looking to rank up. With the arrival of dedicated servers I wonder if there is room for separate game cues for fun and for competitive mode so that everyone playing is on the same page for expectations.
---
Unlike Overwatch or other competitive games out there, DBD doesn't have the population to make separate game modes and ultimately, the "ranked" mode in DBD shouldn't even be taken seriously. People trying to "climb ranks" should change their mindset. DBD is a casual game, period. There is no difficulty in ranking up and devs have been correctly making it easier with each update just with matchmaking and low population in mind.
---
&gt;Group Indicators Indicators that tell other players when survivors are in a group. As a killer I don‚Äôt mind playing against SWF but it is obviously harder to do. I have 60 seconds or less to adjust my load out based on what kinds of players and items I see coming into the game. I feel like a group indicator would provide us all with a better experience by allowing killers to adjust for these groups. This would be a simple balance adjustment so every single game killers are coming in fully armed for SWF destruction and end up whipping the floor with a bunch of solo survivors. As a survivor this would allow me to better know if a player is going to need me help to get off a hook or if they have a friend who is more motivated to help them. There‚Äôs obvious pros and cons here but I think it‚Äôs a simple way to add depth to the game.
---
Half the people in this sub are against SWF and want devs to completely remove it even though SWF is what saved and keeps DBD growing (people wanting to have fun with their friends). Adding this feature would only result in killers dodging SWF groups as opposed to "equipping a better loadout". Countless times I played with my friends (who are casual players, could barely loop a killer) against a Ruin Nurse with Ebony mori and we still escaped effortlessly. Which killer would you choose from here? When the most broken stuff you could use doesn't work simply because you lack the actual skill? The result would be dodging every time you get a SWF (as most killers already do). Ultimately, not every SWF is a depip squad, some of them even use meme loadouts or make dumb plays like going down in front of a hook while the killer is someone else just because they don't want their buddy to get hooked. So bringing your strongest stuff isn't even justifiable.

---
I wish they did. 90% of killers run the same 2-3 core perks. Most survivors are the same.
---
Have you confronted him yet? Ask him why he uses stuff if he sucks.
---
To me that‚Äôs just the devs own poor design. I suppose you can use either of these things and stand still if you want, but you‚Äôre hard gimping yourself if you ever do against any competent player.
---
I remember I played Tapp once and got this glitch where at the start of the match I was stuck having a "STRUGGLE" text below and I constantly crouched extremely fast (like you need a fucking macro for it) this was annoying because if I was in a chase and sprint away, my momentum would abruptly stop because the damn crouching... I messaged the huntress later to say that I got glitched and sent a video with it, she/he was pretty chill with it and understood.
---
had a game like that before, except we were two claudettes and it was a huntress on mother's dwelling. you can imagine the scenario lol
---
\^The survivor that \*gets it\*
---
He‚Äôs really not that bad with certain builds.
---
Thana and Sloppy Butcher are awesome on him.
---
Also his pallet breaking add on is hilariously fun.
---
He has no perks bro üòî
---
Hadn't thought about that, but yeah, you're right.  
---
I don't have access to the ptb, but my impression is that he's a better version of freddy
---
&gt;look if you don't like Tyde for some idiotic reasons I don't care. 
---
&gt;Proceeds to defend him
---
Worked up...?
---
You must be some snowflake if you think this is what "getting worked up" looks like.
---
You can always hide behind some objects nearby after getting out of the victim‚Äôs vision nearby so you have a good start on your next chase.
---
Idk how but I almost always manage to 4K merciless with legion
---

THANK YOU FOR LOCATING MY LONG LOST SON, DALE DEMOGORGON, HEIR TO THE HAWKINS-LAB DEMOGORGONS
---
IF THERES ANYTHING I CAN EVER DO TO REPAY YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS ASK
---
Yeah, with that he is for sure the worst kind of toxic survivor who will have the goal of pissing off the killer rather than playing the game. What's in the gif isn't even toxic just a good save. The Mike should have known not to walk through the pallet when he knew someone was around.
---
‚ÄúYou got the picture? Ok, bye!‚Äù
---
oh so they're going to be just like freddy
---
which means they're going to get nerfed again, never have a SINGLE change in their power like increased movement speed in FF or something and then 2 years from now they're going to get reworked and become a good killer
---
nice
---
Randomly make a survivor hear the sound effect
---
*turns slowly and dc‚Äôs
---
I can hear this comment
---
Doesn't the doctor do that?
---
Nice to know that you got the nice side of looking like a asshole for a dumb reason.  I got downvoted to shit lol
---
Neat
---
This is why you don‚Äôt let rank 20‚Äôs have nice things
---
Oh your right, I forgot
---
Ya love to see it
---
* hmm someone with neon clothes?
---
DODGE
---
* Two survivors happened to load in at the same time?
---
* They are the same character?
---
* They all have an item?
---
*They have more hours on me in the game?
---
There is no need for the killer to see survivors, or at the very least their name/username, I hope they remove that
---
lmfao looks like u gotta divorce him
---
I personaly don't like Legion but there's this one guy in OCE who wont stop playing him and shreds everygame with no addons or offerings... I think his name is TripodMIXER
---
go to one of trues videos and look at the comments
---
No matter how you want me to perceive it, it‚Äôll still be fuelling the flames dude, I‚Äôm sure you had good intent, but for next time remember this if you truly want the community to be better üëåüèª
---
I made a condensed version
---
1. Play against Spirit
---
2. Die
---
Then 4k is it is with these hoes.
---
Now that's being an asshole.
---
What‚Äôs noed? I‚Äôm not apart of small dick community so I wouldn‚Äôt knowüòÇüòÇ lmao jk
---
Easily the best killer Ive watched
---
Killers would rather just cry than take the simple advice to counter them
---
Then they wonder why they're still trash at the game. WHEREZ MUH 4K COTE
---
&gt;If it glows, it goes.
---
IMO, it's better to cleanse it and have it gone than to leave it there. Sure, a 60 second expose sucks, especially against killers like Spirit or Nurse, but it's easier to come back from an early game Haunted Grounds than it is a late one. Not to mention, if it ends up being a Devour Hope, it's better to get it out of the way before the expose -&gt; mori train gets going.
---
No but I have what you were looking for...
---
*ATTENTION*
---
You cant, no, no, probably
---
It's implied they hear the heartbeat.
---
Killer got greedy lmao
---
I mean people with that philosophy are specifically why I wanted to help. But sure if you don't want to put in the effort to learn, adapt, and improve. You're welcome to just keep dying. :)
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
Also, points yo!
---
Legion is great at pipping because he gets so many hits and most survivors aren‚Äôt great.
---
I just made a guide for running spirit. I'll probably do a nurse one in the future
---
Kill them all johnny
---
Thank you for the info! So it's definitely a feature then not a bug
---
What‚Äôs the joke here?
---
I personally like it a lot. Allows me to really only leave my gen if the killer is actually going for me, and then i have plenty of time to get to a pallet.
---
its totally broken vs stealth killers like GF or pig or wraith. But its a bit more tricky to use vs nurse or spirit (can't look at them at will...)
---
If u can loop the well enough but even then it would probably have to be an m1 killer for it to be worth running. It's not that it's a bad perk but perks like ds, iron will, adrenaline, are just more useful in general
---
You spoke with truth
---
*^^but ^^at ^^least ^^you're ^^not ^^bitter* ^^:P
---
Classic Meg
---
My bby Steve lookin like he hit up that MCR record after Nancy broke up with him. üò©
---
She just double the ugly
---
I mainly play survivor. I just don‚Äôt like that there is an advantage based on just character model. And yes the advantage is lessened with correct settings but it‚Äôs still an advantage
---
I'll trade you no longer seeing survivors' characters/usernames/time played/etc in the lobby with seeing what offerings they use and the next map in lobby.
---
Alert
---
Is checking a locker considered a break action?
---
wait it's finally coming to Canada
---
I got a dig bick ya know *cries softly*
---
Yep! I guess because the animation is always them slamming the locker? Very helpful though
---
I had a crew think I brought a scratched mirror until I finally popped EW2 with one generator left. Sometimes it be like that
---
Who buys DBD for Legion?  Even when he was a baby tunnel machine he wasn't worth getting the game solely for.
---
Holy crap I've played him one or twice before in purple ranks, he was rank 1 at the time and killed everyone in under 10 minutes without addons. I've only caught one of his streams but he was playing survivor at the time. Was hoping to see him play some more Legion.
---
Why do I taste salt 
---
Oh that's why
---
whats the question? ill try and answer but no guarantee
---
Of Hag.
---
Thank god maybe people will stop playing him after a while
---
You didnt post a question
---
Yeah I had the unpleasantry of having to play with him recently, after a nice long drought. All random teammates, hes a red rank, I'm a red rank, the other two were purple ranks and we were vsing a plague who we find is using the add on to see aurus of puking survivors.  The other 2 weren't the best, but he dogged on them fucking hard.  But it's like bro, you got like 6000 hours, I sure hope you're better than the purple ranks, but you dont gotta bring them down like that. 
---
And out of our whole team, he was the only one cleansing. To me personally, I'd rather deal with an m1 killer who can see my auru when I puke instead of a fucking AoE 1 shot down.
---
And thats the reason why.
---
I find I like bond much better than empathy
---
I just hope they run decent on console or don't get delayed.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d1vq2i/is_legion_op_im_not_super_involved_in_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
or how about when you spend 10-15 minutes trying to get in a lobby, only to get kicked after the entire loading bar fills up
---
I had zero interest in DBD. Then the trailer for legion came out showing a fast killer and i was interested. Now hes slow and just a M1 killer that has to run a very specific build in order to be some what redeemable.
---
They would break much quicker, and won't earn you much distance on the killer if you don't stun them.
---
Imagine playing all day against atleast 1 Object of Obsession and 1-2 spine chill's as GhostFace. Not im banned for 2 days xD. I really got mad
---
_*U,W,U*_
---
I wish they would actually regularly release perks impactful enough to address broken/unfun mechanics - at least that way things would actually be more dynamic.
---
As it stands, only Ruin, Bamboozle, Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike are truly powerful perks that address issues that should instead be solved by means of actual changes in game design. Maybe NOED, to a lesser extent. That's 4/5 perks, most of them years and years old.
---
Execute order 66
---
I just run after a pallet stun.
---
Is this from ‚ÄòAeon Flux‚Äô?
---
That's what I read but I haven't found anything confirming it... I guess I'll ~~die~~ wait on a pallet
---
You're welcome :)
---
Great timing üëç
---
If you are amazing at looping then yes but personally I have only only run it to try and get the adept Laurie achievement. Personally I saw it a ton right after ghostface came out and in my experience it just made the killers tunnel those with it like crazy
---
How did a skill check occur when u got picked up?
---
Deal
---
What does "Farmed" mean in this context? I've seen it said a couple times, but I don't play survivor much
---
Damn, that's tough
---
the perks dont matter to much on her. its the add ons that matter 
---
silent phasing is very powerful. 
---
you can use some perks to help her gen grab easier 
---
ruin and thrill of the hunt so anyone who tries to cleanse your ruin will just be pulled off and hooked
---
discordance will let you know if 2 or more are on a single gen so you know where to phase. 
---
monitor and abuse will help you get closer to the survivors to make sure you can phase long enough to gen grab them
---
By far the best perk you can run on Spirit is a good pair of headphones. Everything else is just superfluous.
---
GIT GUD UR TRAZH U RANK 20 NEWB HAHA
---
I figured it was just my internet shitting out but when I saw everything freeze and I got hit during that freeze? I recognized immediately what was going on.
---
I personally like to use any perks that allow me to see where they are. Perks like surveillance and discordance are usually what I go with just because it‚Äôs fun to yoink people off gens. It‚Äôs also pretty fun to fake out vaulting and getting people to come back to you. Surround sound headsets are super useful in spirit as well! :)
---
I really want to try a build with Unbreakable, Tenacity, flip flop, and boil over. Be like slippery meat build.
---
It‚Äôs fine.  My comment sounded a bit rude if you read it in the wrong tone.
---
It's called decisive strike, a perk my Laurie Strode, after getting unhooked you have a chance to escape the killers grasp
---
I really like the idea of the power besides the breaking hooks part.
---
I love all of that. How would you introduce the entity though? Is trapper just a slave doing it's bidding? Or does the entity promise him something in return? Also would it take place in a junkyard for him specifically?
---
Lol, I'm dying
---
I don't think her being black is a advantage like she's black she isn't going to be crystal clear in dark maps unless you have good vision. Like people complain about Claudette being hard to see but never say a word about Adam and Tapp that makes no sense.
---
"And then everyone clapped"
---
The best is when you start to bring them to the hatch and they struggle off you and then BM you afterward like they just out played you
---
Thx!
---
He's trying to do to DBD what his bitchass did to Smite
---
Put all the survivors on the hooks
---
One time I was being chased by hillbilly, I was the last survivor left and he stood there for a second, I kept running and next thing I knew I teleported  to him from like 20m away, got downed instantly and then he proceeded to mori me. I am eagerly waiting for dedicated servers as well.
---
Nicuuuuuu :D
---
I get what you mean, but me and many others have used that name for a while. You can read it however you like in your head. 10 years in the making is 10 years of tons of people using that name, including me. Thank you for the comment, opinions and emotions must not be contained. And thanks to comments they don't have to be.
---
\[laugh track\]
---
JAKE: Dwight?
---
DWIGHT: What?
---
JAKE: Where's the exit gate? 
---
DWIGHT: Goes right there. See, I kited the killer while you opened it.
---
JAKE: You were supposed to not get hooked.
---
DWIGHT: Dude, It's just Phase 2! JAKE: Oh really?
---
DWIGHT: Yes!
---
JAKE: So go get the escape points!
---
DWIGHT: Okay, I will! *tcch* \[bumps into door\] \[laugh track\]
---
\[rattles the door, turns around, paws  the door\] 
---
DWIGHT: ...I see the problem.
---
JAKE: Oh, do ya?!
---
I dont agree with Immortal trumping DS, because then it just rewards tunneling. It's the same reason Enduring doesnt affect DS. 85% would also most likely be too much 
---
Also, doesnt Man Behind The Mask practically already exist
---
Exactly what the last guy said, I had previously been hooked and was able to hit a skill check and escape the killers grasp.
---
I heard $11.99
---
I do this every single day i play with urban evasion and it feels great.
---
The entity has already been established as a godlike being, it likely will be heard whispering through the killers pov about how they are in it's world now, and they are all his.. considering all the killers have been adjusted to hire and the fact that the entity can increase their bloodlust makes the killers sacrificing them work well. And if they need to have a scene establishing the entity it could be a most or a pov so no one knows what the entity looks like, feeding to what BHVR wants the Entity to be.
---
Isn‚Äôt she 115? Just don‚Äôt crouch until you‚Äôre near (32 M) to a gen or survivor
---
Thanks, been working on my killer skills, which are definitely improving.
---
I honestly thought I wasn't gonna land it, but sure enough it hit its mark. ‚ù§
---
No0bGANG
---
He also actively bitches and moans until he gets hate brigades to try and mass-scale ruin the game environment. Like what he did with smite
---
Otz is the reason I main trapper
---
Ticky Toby, Jeff, or even the Rake, all could work really well!
---
Then you realize he has instant saw
---
&gt; -I'll Carry You: You love helping people. Take on another survivors burden every 120/90/60 seconds by exchanging up to one health state with them. When next to a downed or injured survivor, spend 8/6/4 seconds healing them. Once this is complete, they will be healed one health state, while you will become injured a health state. "It's gonna be okay honey. I got you. I got you." - Unknown
---
Feels weak to me but not a bad concept.
---
&gt; -Reparations: Every game you are able to repair up to 1/2/3 pallets. After repairing a pallet, you have a cool down of 60 seconds before you can repair another one. Your hard work causes Exhaustion for 60 seconds. Repairing a pallet takes 60/50/40 seconds. This perk is affected by toolboxes. "What do you mean it's fucking broken? Broken isn't in my vocabulary." -Unknown
---
Cool idea. Repairing the god pallet feels strong but 40 seconds is a while.
---
&gt; -Stay Down: Knowing survivors are writhing in agony on the ground fuels your sadistic nature. Survivors bleed-out bar decreases 30/35/40% faster than normal when you are 20 meters or further away from them. For every survivor you kill while this perk is active, you receive 5% more Bloodpoints. "Stay in the dirt like the worm that you are." -Unknown
---
Not a fan of this one. 
---
&gt; -Hex: Molasses: The fear you instill in survivors paralyzes them. All survivors receive a 5/10/15% speed penalty to all actions. Once the totem is cleansed, a 30/60/90 second timer begins. During this time, the penalty decreases by 1% every 6 seconds. "Down they fall, one by one, swallowed whole, beneath the sun. The ground is thick, its just begun, they kick and squeal, until its done." -Unknown
---
Hex ruins #2? Ruins is poorly designed we don't need another one.
---
Interesting this would make slowing the game down even easier and give her more time to hook survivors Though add ons would need to be changed to match these new effects
---
Honestly, massive props for enduring playing huntress on console. I play on ps4 and I can't play huntress without missing a million shots (even with infantry belt on) and getting super tilted
---
Mmm such delicious salt
---
Link? Again, I think it‚Äôs a great guide you wrote in just pointing out how it applies to almost all killers. I suppose we could discuss huntress being different as well.
---
Yikes, I guess my impressions get downvotes.  Anyway, I haven't watched  much ptb gameplay.  I just thought the teleports seemed similar.
---
**Dont come to the fog tomorrow**
---
Same. Got PC but all friends play PS4.
---
Oh! Salt! Just in time for dinner.
---
Spine chill, Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, and Self care.
---
Every Meg/Claudette build on Xbox. I hate playing against them because all they do is hide.
---
Is that the regress smoke from a 'good skill check'? Hah.
---
It's just in this reddit. I posted it 30mins ago so if you search by new it should be right there
---
Yeah I was having some ideas for those
---
So he had noed or what?
---
I only use alert on Feng, had no idea it works for lockers.
---
**[Rule 1 - Uncivil Behaviour.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules#wiki_1._uncivil_behavior)** Be respectful towards other users and players. We all love the same game. There's no need to be a dick.
---
* Do not post flamebait or troll other users.
---
Run in circles in the corn, leave a fake trail and then walk. Be careful because the corn is planted in lines, and the killer will see you if you are in the same line as them. Switch lines accordly and try to walk even if is just small distances to stop the scratch marks. If you dont see the red light, _don't run_.
---
Most of the time, when I lose someone, I find them again because they panic and keep running.
---
An experienced killer (not me lol) will be able to find you in the corn anyways tho, so your best chance is just trying to confuse them by running around them and hopping their attacks miss to gain some extra seconds and find a looping spot.
---
Good luck in the fog!
---
She is good at delaying the game with her traps. Don‚Äôt save them for the late game. 
---
Use perks like monitor and abuse and surveillance. They will allow you to get close to a survivor on a gen while walking (faster), then crouch for stealth when you locate them out of heartbeat range. 
---
If you are good with the lunge, you can turn quickly around corners in tight loops. 
---
Also, don‚Äôt always use the charge. You can yank some people right off the gen if you just start to stand when you are near someone around a corner. 
---
Even if you don‚Äôt end up using her a lot, once you unlock Surveillance and Make your Choice, those perks are awesome on other killers. 
---
Good luck and just try to have fun.
---
The hook outside the shack was sabotaged, knew he had to go basement.
---
Hot take: don‚Äôt complain about meta survivor perks, when you use them yourself
---
Thank you for the feedback, I really appreciate it.
---
I totally agree that perks like that are a bandaid, not a solution. But Hex: Molasses affects all actions, not just repairs. 
---
I agree that 40 seconds is a long time. I just felt like if people had that perk and toolboxes, God-pallets could be brought back. And it‚Äôd give survivors something else to do besides gens.
---
What is reference.
---
well shit it looks like im coming up against Myers's who popped like 3 pills of viagra
---
this is why i think the demogorgen is comparable to the hillbilly other than high mobility
---
Your name is Grounds too?
---
Well usually my teammates are important to me, but if you just farm me for BP, GG
---
this is not russian(huntress) lullaby she sings...
---
Yea it can get pretty frustrating, but I always loved huntress since she released on xbox, and wanted to main her, but the lack of any crosshairs, &amp; the sometimes janky movements on console, made me question my choice to say the least. Lol
---
Don't take it to heart, shit happens sometimes and people won't always understand it... I mean like, look at Disney and Sony, how many people initially thought Sony was in the wrong?
---
Also I don't think this would matter but I don't get triggered as a killer main until the "gg ez" is dropped... thats not fun than.
---
Doug Demogorgon? The owner of the Hawkins Lab Demogorgons?
---
It means unhooking you right in front of killer so you get insta downed again. If they have BT it's fine but otherwise they are shit players
---
LMFAO got me laughing good there ya bastard
---
You mean Otz? Or Pug? I am not watching him as a fan. Pretty neutral on his or ochi's part. Really don't care about all this hate culture. I am just saying - with enough charisma and effort, even an asshole can find people to admire him. And from what i see - usually, assholes are more popular in gaming industry. I could be wrong.
---
Pug haha. Otz is love
---
Maybe one of them gets kidnapped and the others try to rescue and they get stuck after going in. Maybe some fenced in compound or something. Similar to the "the collection"
---
So, if the Investigation Team played Dead by Daylight:
---
Yu - Dwight
---
Yosuke - Steve
---
Chie - Feng
---
Yukiko - Laurie 
---
Kanji - David
---
Rise - Jane
---
Naoto - Tapp
---
glad to hear :)
---
Agreed. Wraith would be terrifying to see in a movie.
---
Have you tried killing survivors? I've heard that its a pretty good way to slow down the game.
---
He looks hot anyway tho üòá
---
sounds like an interesting like a reverse michael myers
---
Smaller terror radius could work.. The one while ina chase and out of a chase etc
---
I don‚Äôt think so, but I‚Äôll have to check. I think the closest to it is something like the Doctor‚Äôs static field causing harder to find skill checks. Also Immortal doesn‚Äôt trump DS, it trumps Enduring. Although even I can agree that‚Äôs probably way too much. I‚Äôll try to alter it to another perk idea when I get any ideas on what to change it too, or if someone else is able to come up with a better perk idea. I‚Äôll be sure to credit them tho, don‚Äôt worry!
---
I use Ruin, Thrilling Tremors, Whispers &amp; BBQ
---
I'm asking for criticism, not sarcasm.
---
Divorce him
---
I usually run ruin, BBQ and chilli, I'm all ears and thrilling tremors
---
I haven't played DBD in months. Do you get to see post mori selfies with Ghostface? lol
---
That‚Äôs true. I‚Äôll work in other ideas for perks and edit it when I get the idea. Thanks for your feedback, have an upvote for your time.
---
Agree with you.
---
Not playing the game for grinding BP, I just want to survive and win. The purpose imo of the game.
---
Tried to accept some farming from killers and it was boring and horrible. Yeah sure I had my bloodpoints but I had zero fun.
---
**THATS RIGHT!**
---
Haha. Thanks. I already upvoted the post. I like the ideas, even though well sadly never get Jason
---
Bond, iron will, exhaustion perk and idk wglf or some shit. Killer would just be bbq maybe spirit/enduring combo
---
"The only way I can play this game is running meta shit."
---
I am still getting pulled back at pallets and windows :(
---
Oh man I didn't know that had a name, happens to me every time I get a survivor daily
---
One I thought of what for Kramer's rapture
---
A purple add on would make it so they would have to fail more generators and more progress on gens would be lost slowing the game down Even More
---
‚ÄúThis number at the top of the screen keeps changing colors and going up. That must mean I‚Äôm doing well!‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.
---
do you know how toxic people will be in game / abusing it? I like how I have to use guesters than the a voice chat.
---
Alas, such technology is beyond our limits
---
We did that one game. We all went to separate generators and had three done within the first minutes of the game. Pretty sure the killer raged at three hens completing within seconds of each other.
---
Some dude on youtube actually made a video about this going into detail about what pennywise is and how the entity could use him/work with him.
---
https://youtu.be/hmVDvqRXY5s
---
Also, just realized now that I never addressed why I changed Balanced Landing. The perk itself opened up too many infinites on some maps even when exhausted. So I figured making it better when not exhausted but making it worse when you are exhausted would balance that out a bit.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs a good idea; inflicting the Broken status effect. The only problem with that is if you‚Äôre not injured, you being Broken won‚Äôt really matter, but you get to pick someone up after only 6 seconds. That could be really unfair.
---
I suggested the Broken status because i thought of the worse case scenario where one survivor picks one up the he goes down 1 state and are both injure but they both have insta heals (most probably will happened with swf) and if the killer is close then they just pop it and run
---
Edit: Worse case for the killer xD
---
Oh dear Neptune...
---
You said ‚Äúevery survivor ever‚Äù
---
Self Care? Not meta at all pretty garbo tbh.
---
Diversion? Not even close to meta but whateves.
---
Adrenaline? Yeah it's good but you actually gotta work for it to become active 
---
DS? Anti-tunnel perk if you don't want to be hit by it don't tunnel me.
---
Don't come at me for use "Meta perk builds" when this is nowhere close.
---
Aww poor fella. Usually on PS4 if everyone uses BP boosters, we‚Äôll all farm. Unless there‚Äôs a try hard.
---
I just created a macro. 
---
I just press a button and it plays a looped recording of me mashing space for 4 seconds
---
Ok, but what is the point of this post?
---
Yeah after spending time on this subreddit I'm convinced that all survivors think noed is op
---
I love urban evasion. I've lost count of the number of times I've slav squatted around some cover only for the killer to walk right on by. I feel like I'm nailed in place without it.
---
5 hours? Really? I‚Äôve got over 50 and my highest killer is level 18 lol
---
I think that Pennywise would actually benefit from working for the entity because the entity is basically providing a never ending cycle of fear for him to feed off of, while at the same time, pennywise would be doing the entity's bidding. It would really be more of a partnership than anything
---
Wait who‚Äôs loud? Steve or Nancy?  Unless you‚Äôre making the ‚ÄúSteve is a mom joke‚Äù and I‚Äôm completely oblivious haha.
---
Seems accurate
---
That would be awesome!
---
it sucks that some "players" use extremely high contrasted graphics that makes it unusable against them during a chase. They see you as if you were in an open field.
---
Came here to say we need a 3rd panel for Hag.
---
Very nice! Love the axe!
---
Just make the broken status stay for 60/50/40 seconds and then it should be a little more balanced
---
A demogorgon only roars when he‚Äôs angry
---
Haha or go full MGS: ‚ÄúHuh?...Just a box!‚Äù
---
Franklin's Demise? I dig it. Also holy fuck I laugh my ass off when other survivors meme during Mori animations
---
I mean hes streaming on console and probably using the built in streaming xbox has. So I'd say hes the poor one.
---
Yep.  As a survivor main, if I notice a player farming people off the hook I will leave that person on the hook to die when it's their turn.  Fucking farmers are a detriment to the team.
---
yeah that
---
The problem is currently reaching rank 1 does not mean much. If you simply play in the DBD discord with random groups enough, you WILL reach rank 1 unless you are a total potatoe. They need to do a mixture of fix their stupid emblem system, fix their match making, and add more rank tiers. The difference of skill levels between the worse rank 1s and the best ones is insane.
---
its like if league of legends took all of their silver to master players and mixed them all together to create a big "metallic" division. It wouldn't mean shit lol
---
Just report to twitch.
---
Yes. The Survivor has a Terror Radius and you don't.
---
&gt;I also want to clarify that I have reached rank 1 on killer and survivor multiple times, and have two p3 characters on each. All my other characters are level 50.
---
I LOL'ed. What does grinding stuff have to do with anything?
---
Dead Harding into a tree is part of my daily routine
---
Join the Nancy main group brother!
---
He's not just a clown, he's the whole circus.
---
Keys should be easier to seee. Medkits and Toolboxes have huge models that the Survivors hold but keys are tiny and practically hidden in the hand. On darker Survivors (P3s) they're nearly impossible to see.
---
Considering how strong they are they should really be easier to see.
---
EXACTLY!!
---
Look he even has Spirit Fury
---
Okay it's not garbage but its honestly not great. It takes 32 seconds (nearly half the time it takes to do a generator) to heal up without a med kit or Botany Knowledge and without sloppy butcher. If they killer has Sloppy it is much longer at that point it would just be best to work on gens injured rather than heal up. I used it because I was playing solo and sometimes teammates are not that smart do I can heal myself.
---
honestly lmao
---
It's called unerving pressence on trapper
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Personal drama.
---
I'd call him The Slasher instead
---
So explain why the DS and Boil Over change is bad. And even with an actual counter argument to my Deliverance change, theres no reason to be so toxic about it
---
Today I had a game against a Clown who was playing like a complete potato. He was getting genrushed to shit and he got a total of maybe 3 hooks that entire match.
---
I thought the guy was doing a daily since he'd hold his bottle at the ready for several seconds and throw them when he was basically right beside a Survivor before hitting them.  
---
Nope. Turns out he was just Rank 7 with three level 1 perks playing against a bunch of Rank 4s.
---
You say lag spike why exactly? I never lagged I don't think at all that game.
---
What a special character you are. I guess it's probably my fault that you're having a misunderstanding. I didn't realize I was talking with a disabled individual.
---
Best of luck to you, and I hope you get the professional help you need!
---
You stopped right when i started. Theres a ton of new stuff and changes now. I hope it's not overwhelming and makes you stop again. This game is too fun.
---
If that's defending him..
---
Oh wait, you are the one who brought him up for no reason, nevermind. I guess I can't argue with someone that has an IQ value comparable to a fridge temperature.
---
Dude, at least stick with a topic, you keep jumping and dodging to make a point or just bitch about someone making shit up for no apparent reason.
---
Welp, you showed me several time how someone like you can't have a discussion and you're not the first one on this sub
---
Sure, that's their intention.
---
But I'm also not going to say thank you because I enjoy playing the game and I don't want to be pushed higher when I don't deserve it.
---
Giving me the exit/hatch is a negative on my fun - I understand they're trying to "be nice" and I'm not going to flame anyone but I'm also not going to thank them for it.
---
I know it doesn't mean much but it would be nice to have an acknowledgeable achievement for those that can't play as much and end up coming back after a couple months from rank 1 to 20.
---
Staring at Jane on the generator
---
It also scares the shit out of people who don't know it makes your terror radius the whole map
---
I'm a solo player, so that's why I use it. Didn't realize it took that long to heal
---
&gt;So explain why the DS and Boil Over change is bad. And even with an actual counter argument to my Deliverance change, theres no reason to be so toxic about it
---
I explained why Deliverance needs to make you broken. Being unable to unhook yourself is far too strong and doing that with the ability to instantly heal yourself, is even worse.
---
Legion might be meh but he's still the best killer if your goal is to reach rank 1.
---
You're basically guaranteed a pip every game. Pretty sure the only way to lose a pip with him is to afk. Even with 0 kills you can pip easy.
---
Noted, will change. Cuz tbh that sounds better. You‚Äôll get credit for your contribution. Enjoy a free upvote!
---
That sounds like a great ad on
---
why?
---
People argue that healing yourself is a waste of time when you should be doing gens. Also that you could have another survivor heal you in half the time it takes to run self care. Also that if you bring a medkit you dont need self care at all
---
Urban Evasion (usually paired with Iron Will) for the stealth jukes.
---
dead hard into a rock lmaooo
---
the hillbilly was friendly.. i tried to get him to kill me for a long time.. was a super long match.. he did end up killing all of the other guys tho for stealthing the whole time..
---
i didn't give her the door more out of principle than anything else.. no rush at that point
---
Yeah it sucks it takes so long but at least they buffed Botany Knowledge in the process and that 33% faster is so good.
---
Thx alot, u have any ideas to balance it?
---
Did you even read my comment? I said you had a counter argument to Deliverance and I asked why the other two didnt work?
---
In his defense, this game wears on you quite a bit. I‚Äôm sure anyone who streams it daily will have their on and off days. I don‚Äôt think many people like the nasty side of tru3 in particular, but you see it with everyone. Even otz has his days where he‚Äôs more touchy
---
I don't think I expressed it was new but I've only ever played it once.  Shit was evil as hell.
---
So far I'm loving all the changes I come across. My favorite change has been the endgame countdown. Only thing I don't like is there's no explanation what each status effect does in-game. I have no clue what's happening when I get one
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6r\_3HMTs9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6r_3HMTs9M)
---
I agree.  DS being infinite after first hook second down would be fine gameplay wise, or at least if it had a far more generous timer because, as it stands it feels like ass when you get downed after 30 seconds of chase, and the way the skill works it almost encourages you to force the killer to tunnel you over getting more time out via looping which is kinda the opposite of how the perk should work as it should be a safety net for longer use over shorter use.
---
That's kinda funny haha
---
Pay no attention to it.
---
If anything, don't run. I always find running survs
---
Why is tru3 chaotic neutral? I don't understand your chart
---
You won‚Äôt get banned for that
---
They said i deserve being reported because i never had any to put on myself
---
Those are hilarious! Myers just standing in the background and Leatherface with the sax. Did you publish these? I will leave a like when I log into Dreams the next time.
---
This would also Increase your chances of scoring a kill with the bear traps and even if they remove it they lose a bunch of time.
---
Thanks
---
I suck at the game, so I need to be fully healed if I want to survive a chase for more than a few seconds. I do run plunders instinct though, so I could probably go without self care
---
r/UnexpectedSCP
---
And they're always wearing the prestige clothes + deathgarden mask.
---
Yeah slowing the game down alot
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I like it man
---
I feel attacked
---
Love the idea of giving the bloodpoints of DCers to the team.
---
Oh that makes sense!
---
Because uhhhh... Gens only take 80 seconds.
---
Which is about how long it takes to simply find and injure a red rank survivor while not using a really good hero
---
Works great along with when you have a hill to use as advantage point, to see blendettes in the corn.
---
Please show me where OP said that that's not the objective? Also if not finding a survivor makes you a bad killer, I can say without a doubt that you and every other killer is a dog shit killer. We've all lost survivors or spent an entire match not finding a survivor. Your logic is shit and your argument is against someone who hasn't even said anything about if or if not Meg can play that way.
---
Make them bigger and this will look like my wife's vagina.
---
The earth is flat. Bigfoot stepped on it!
---
the rarity just means how strong the perk is, and yes you want kindred
---
Rarity doesn't matter, it's just a visual color change to indicate the level of perk without having to read it right away. At least with most perks, but yes they do indicate usefulness, more of the low powered perks don't get a purple (very rare) rarity, but they're still useful in their own right.
---
I can't stop laughing now
---
Survivor can‚Äôt get 30k base without escaping. Survival category is 8k. You only get 5k for escaping anyway. So max you can get without escaping is 24k. With would only be 29k. 
---
Killer maxing every category except sacrifice, but getting 2 hooks each puts him at about 5k for sacrifice instead of the full 8k. So he‚Äôs still guaranteed 29k even with no actual kills.
---
Neverending storyyyy
---
"Ding ding ding, yes I'm a candle now."
---
He‚Äôs using bots for the likes.
---
Its pretty pointless, its not easy to type on a controller. In fact, most people use their phones for the actual messages.
---
I'm assuming it's because it's not really needed? Like, the killer will be long gone by the time you finish typing your sentence.
---
Probably because it‚Äôs a terrible idea?
---
1/8 games you‚Äôll get a GG the other 7 it‚Äôs someone whining about something.
---
Send in the clowns.
---
Do you have any video of this? I didn't think that was possible.
---
+100. Yeah you probably get more blood points but running around like an idiot but it's literally the point of this game to not get caught by the killer and if being stealthy is your thing then by all means do it. As long as you help with gens and unhooking.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
---
Nerf,its too op
---
totally not,is all more based on your playstile,if you get hooked easily,go for kindred,if you get gens quite a lot,dark sense is your way
---
about gosthface,1 think that his playstile is like a michael ninja mixed with the tier 3 miers,if you check a lot the spots is not that hard,just get paranoia
---
You better have let them escape
---
Interesting idea not gonna lie
---
Shroud of separation??
---
Some can curb it 90 degrees and nail you. Takes practice but is possible.
---
r/usefulnobody
---
prior the rarity of perks is pointless,think one of the best perks is iron will
---
r/GrammarNazi
---
Yep.  Strangely enough *the exact bug happened to me while I was leveling Meg.*  Poor David was fucking omegastabbed by the killer, T-Bagged me twice quickly for the "PLZ OH GOD WHY IT HURTS HEAL ME" sign language and I tried really hard, then it didn't let me even push the button to heal like the prompt wasn't there so I did the double slow T-Bag for "I'm sorry the game is borked" and then he died finding someone else, it was really sad.
---
Worst glitch NA.
---
The only category you can run out of is objective and thats if 1-2 survivors are greedy and do all the gens without the others.
---
You get survival points for self healing and against Trapper, Doctor, Freddy, Pig, Plague, Legion, and Ghostface for avoiding their powers in each respective way.
---
It is entirely possible in a farming match at least to hit that 8k survival without eacaping.
---
Unfortunatly no. I always screenshot just as the camera takes the picture though
---
The downside of Spine Chill is that if the killer is smart, he will just go towards you looking to the opposite side, and also, it can mislead you that the killer is going after you when in reality he is not.
---
Premonition on the other hand, you have 100% accuracy of where the killer is. Even if the killer is not behind you, you still know which direction he is, this is very useful, but as mentioned before, its cooldown is really a downside and to add to it, you have to constantly look to one side to another when Spine Chill just activates automatically.
---
Concluding, Spine Chill is a cheap, but not so accurate killer detector and Premonition is an expensive, but accurate killer detector.
---
Monto, Noob and Puppers you watch to laugh
---
Zubat and True you watch for stellar gameplay
---
Otz and Tyme you watch for numbers, stats and tips
---
Bricky you watch when he doesn't upload a For Honor video
---
And Ochido you don't watch
---
Yea that‚Äôs my point, autohaven is honestly my favorite map for billy cause survivor get really confident at strong loops
---
Horror scary game
---
Thanks man. Otherwise, I like it. The power is definitely very unique and could be a very fun mechanic to learn, somewhat similar to Nurse. I also like your perk called Slasher because it reminds me of an idea I had for a killer Idea I did for The Operator from Marble Hornets. Mine was called Always Watching and it was if you stand still and watch an unhook the rescuer becomes exhausted
---
I got 2 people posing in the background on a selfie before. Chill guys
---
You can literally crop it out with paint
---
Spirit, since I‚Äôd have 0 information.
---
**Destroy them all, my child**
---
Sorry, just one of my pet peeves..
---
My god, I hate these kinds
---
Got a 3 man once and the person that escaped sent me something like that.
---
Okay buddy
---
Oh I blinked and you spun around too fast lmfao. Thought you teleported.
---
This would be great for like rank 15-8
---
I eventually find one and bbq does the rest.
---
I‚Äôll take your word for it. Like I said, I don‚Äôt watch too much Twitch, but if Puppers is indeed as fake as you claim he is, then yeah, even I was fooled. The few times I turned in, he seemed to be having a good time and a blast, involving his viewers and interacting with them.
---
Yes, 24th of september
---
r/ImagesYouCanHear
---
Yep, very inexperienced player here and hag traps literally make me shriek like a little girl every time still
---
Yeah I kinda am thinking of something else with this pic...
---
there should be quick chat buttons, a wheel shows up and you use the stick to select dialogue options like ‚ÄúGG,‚Äù ‚ÄúWell Played,‚Äù stuff like that.
---
Im sorry to say this but most killers wouldnt fall for that. Survivors moaning makes a huge fucking noise and it is easy to follow them even if you cant see them, any sceatches or blood, just because of the softcore porno sounds they make
---
Did you record a youtube video and post it...you know you can timestamp youtube videos and directly link them right?
---
Show
---
He's not messing around, he is gonna beat the killer's ass.
---
because doing so would quickly wear out people's F key, A key, and G key
---
thats what i said, the ghostface
---
Yeah
---
yes
---
don't forget a "Your Trash" button
---
I just don't want to destroy my keyboard
---
You must be thinking about someone else. HybridPanda is the wholesome dude that does shrine watch.
---
Yep, i dont know how much of a pain in the ass survivors are in consoles so thats why i recomend those
---
Good Ideas, I would give more Bloodpoints for Self Care though.
---
I like the Idea of the Bloodpoint split. Maybe there could be a reward for Survivors in general who don't disconnect.
---
üê∑
---
GOD, so satisfying!
---
&gt;be me, killer main, just started playing survivor
---
&gt;"facing the shape" tip
---
&gt;lmao it's cornfield, Myers is fucked
---
&gt;there's no terror radius so I'm safe to do a gen
---
&gt;another surv comes and we're almost done
---
&gt;wait who the fuck gave Myers t3 this quickly
---
&gt;we did
---
&gt;he got a 4k before in 3 minutes after that
---
Me and my friends have made a rule that we will never use that mori in our kill your friends game since it pisses us all off
---
I play him with his duration add-ons, sloppy butcher, distressing, nurses, and whatever I decide on for a 4th perk. And I can 4k easily with him, but prefer to just run around jump scaring everyone, FF slashing, and just being able to run around the entire game and not being bored. I usually let everyone live just so everyone gets something out of it.
---
misunderstood lol good point
---
Secretly just the wraith after he's stunned
---
Even easier. You can use the snapshot tool and just draw a white block over it. It's a 3 second process.
---
No, hiding isnt the point of the game. Your objective is to do gens and help teammates by unhooking, healing, bodyblocking and looping the killer.
---
She‚Äôs kind of boring as a character and more wise she doesn‚Äôt speak our language or any known language her skins are basic she‚Äôs got a cool power and I think she‚Äôs a great killer just everything else is boring
---
wtf is claudette doing?
---
There is just one tiny problem with this idea and that's the fact it couldn't ever possibly work because of the playerbase. Games like overwatch and CS:GO a bunch of players so they can afford to divide the playerbase a lot, but queue times in DbD are pretty long as it is right now already. (This is the actual reason why casual hasn't been added yet, and more ranks would have a similar effect). 
---
I love the idea, but it just couldn't work
---
Yeah all the problems definitely didn‚Äôt just magically disappear lol
---
Don't be the first caught survivor
---
Don‚Äôt talk about my meg like that
---
It's literally exactly the same at all levels. The only difference is the speed boost provided.
---
This happened to me yesterday XD
---
[I &lt;3 Entity](https://clips.twitch.tv/PlausibleRoughJaguarFeelsBadMan)
---
&gt;I swear... Having these weird ass lunges and seeing them obviously not connect but still wounding you is just frustrating.
---
Its called ping, every only game has it. There is no way to change this or remove it unless you are the host playing survivor in KYF or playing in LAN environment.
---
Decisive Strike &amp; An Exhaustion Perk
---
You already have ruin now you're going to make me find a cannister before I even learn that ruin is a active?
---
Fuuuuck that
---
Going beast mode lol it's a state of rage think dragonballz
---
every time
---
thats not what this post was talking about. I know that, they were saying farm as in letting them do gens while they did circles, letting them drop pallets for stuns, letting survivors heal themselves/eachother. Not farming as in "get pulled off hook in front of the killer". Thanks for the downvote tho
---
I'm sure it's another mistake of theirs then ... I ain't complaining though!
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight
---
Hearing in his voice all the time:
---
"in *this* video..."
---
I always say gg unless 
---
-I truly got tunneled to death(e.g. Playing as Dwight, Huntress tunneled me hard, other survivors even tried to body block :( While being carried, when I wiggled, the Huntress was nodding like a jerk. I wish I could DC, but I do not want to be a bad person or hypocrite),  or
---
-die to survivor trolls (Running around me, sandbagging, and blowing up every gen I am on, and also fast vaulting literally everything. I hope that Bill is banned, he got all the other survivors to think I was the useless one, even the killer. &gt;:(
---
Camping depends, facecamping is funny when everyone lives and killer dcs.)
---
Either way, I appreciate good killers that skillfully kill me, and why most killers I love to face are the more viable ones, survivors need to stop complaining and enjoy the challenge. :D
---
How do u know its haunted tho
---
huntress yeeting hatchets at a *VERY* hihg speeds
---
I hate it when people DC.  At the same time, though, I often feel like doing the same after I get back-to-back campers and tunnelers for a straight hour of play.
---
This is actually really helpful, thanks for the tips :)
---
Ruin, pop, discordance, nurses
---
Nea wounded: UH EE UEH UUH OH
---
Since when does this subreddit talk about killers period? It's 90% memes, 5% horrible killer/survivor concepts, 5% actual talk about the game
---
Screaming and roaring still are both vocalizations that can serve the same roles. We, humans, still instinctively scream when sufficiently scared or hurt in order to call for help, for example.
---
... Gee, what was the start of this conversation, again ?
---
&gt;Why would a human roar after hitting someone?
---
Ah. Well, statements previous to that were:
---
&gt;Well, the Demogorgon is an animal. Animals tend to make loud noises when excited.
---
and:
---
&gt;Switch Demogorgon to Human and it's still the same
---
So, technically, the original claim with the "Humans are also animals" wasn't about roaring, but making loud noises in general.
---
This sounds really cool.
---
Ideas for perks or addons?
---
Shes alright but pretty much useless at high ranks since her whole gimmick is making you not heal/want to heal, which people do less and less as rank goes up. She basically needs the add ons that make the survivor break instantly to be viable at all past being an m1
---
Probably using Tenacity.
---
Stop tbagging. Idk
---
Character wise, she‚Äôs as plain as grass. She has boring cosmetics, annoying hit sound effect, weird mori that doesn‚Äôt even seem fatal (she pukes on their face, how tf does that kill them?) and she‚Äôs just boring. Even her reason for killing is shit, ‚ÄúI want to stop this disease... by spreading it to others‚Äù 
---
Gameplay wise she‚Äôs cool as ice though
---
*Joesph Joestar impression* Niiiiiiiiiccccccccccceeeeeee
---
Unless your idea of fun is treating toxic behavior in kind?
---
This is Identity V erasure
---
Just moris of newer characters have more cinematic view.
---
And because I know people love reading these as much as I do, here are the item descriptions for the bloody cosmetics:
---
Gore-Soaked Jaw:   Blood and gore drips from the stretched jaws of the Demogorgon. What became of its victim is better left unsaid. 
---
Splattered Demogorgon:     Is that deer blood or human blood? Probably both.
---
Crimson Claw:    Blood trickles along the slick creases of The Demogorgon's hand. The Hawkins Police may have another missing persons case on their hands.
---
Yeah, old versions of spine chill had less range. Its been patched so 1-3 all have 36 meters.
---
Shes just overshadowed. Nothing special either
---
I got surprised when I managed to get a merciless victory as a lvl 1 legion in purple ranks. I just wanted the daily but I got 32k bp as well
---
Same lol
---
Can we have dead by daylight at home? You really fucked the meme that bad
---
Yep.
---
"Look at all these cuties!"
---
Like someone I didn‚Äôt even see till I hooked them in the egc was like gg ez. Like bitch, you lost the only chase you got into and meatshotted good skill checks for 6 minutes.
---
I love this perk.
---
were you killer?
---
Pebble main big brain
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d1xrhp/a_time_consuming_hook_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yeah in other language versions of the instructions female identifiers/version of words are used when talking about the Entity. The wiki even mentioned this well before the End Game Collapse came out
---
I mean when DS was inexcusably broken he never used it. Groaning about something isn't necessarily condemnation.
---
If I drop a dream pallet and freddy gets me I'll groan about it, I'll also still use them.
---
He groans about exploitable map design but he'll often iterate that "abusing bad map design isn't on the survivor" because he does the same thing.
---
He usually has a "fuck" moment if someone dead hards but, again, it's more because the game is stressful normally and it's even more so when someone outplays you lol.
---
His biggest complaints are mostly now down to 1) survivor sided map design, 2) inability for non-S tier killers to compete with the gen-rush, 3) Devs making questionable decisions that weaken killers
---
I love survivors doing this and never get any doing it in mine, just DCs on mori
---
huh weird. if you were killer, i would say maybe they thought you were planning on teaming up with one specific survivor which is against BHVR's rules, but that's just odd
---
Nice touch adding in the lullaby
---
I once had a survivor complain that I gave them the hatch because I hooked them in basement and found them in a locker before their teammate. I thought I was screwed because it was a P3 Laurie who I thought had DS but she didn‚Äôt.
---
Original character
---
Open the exit gate stop having it be closed
---
I know tbh i think they were just a bit salty
---
Yep ive had it happen several times
---
Basically this.
---
Why is the killer profile hidden? If it wasn‚Äôt it would help us decide our loadout since we‚Äôll expect you to be overly altruistic.
---
It is when it's constant and you straight up admit you only play the game for money. He also always tries to force people to like the "Dead By Daylight killer games" like Deathgarden and Hide or Die. I swear, anytime a new horror like online game comes out, he always talks about how amazing it is and how much better than DBD it is and everyone should play that. 
---
Also, what he did with Smite. Putting him as lawful evil and not any worse is kinda surprising. No0b3 is much less cancerous and is actually funny.
---
I think they said the guy looked like a 10 year old
---
would be cool to have the survivors be as children though every time you play against Pennywise!
---
Maybe reduce it to 15 seconds and then have add ons to extend the length. But otherwise that is my favorite
---
In-game
---
Playing as killer: Ghost face
---
Survivors glitched the game(According to the message i got after i left the game) where they stopped their hooked timer after I hooked them 1 by 1. I dont know how they did this but it was very time consuming
---
How does it help?
---
I was super drunk and kept flailing wildly with my knife instead of stalking. I'm pretty trash even when I'm sober but the vodka really didn't help.
---
Had a Claudette killer herself for me yesterday, and 2 other survivors by Endgame  collapse, all because I was having a bad game/sparing them at the end and standing in the corner broken after being genrushed to death. 
---
I had to kill an Ace for a Claudette who had the exit gate glitch, the Ace wanted anyway for sparing them after double hooking everyone. Survivors and killers are both equally nice people :)
---
‚ÄúMegan‚Äù

Relevance?
---
Survivor: Dead Hard for no reason.
---
TT: Noice Dedard mate. *Brow twitch*.
---
It's absolutely shit
---
Kinda misses the point if no mithers high risk hi reward trade off, it also misses that part of the appeal to no mither is the ability to run dead hard and still utilize it against killers who expose.
---
I like to drop fireworks in the middle of em
---
Dead hard is for tinybrains only
---
I was carrying a claudette to a hook when the end game timer ran out, she wiggled out and whenever i swung this happened. Game didn‚Äôt end even after she left :(
---
If i'm the killer and you do this then your chance of being given hatch rises substantially
---
That‚Äôs why I made the third option, where you have to run the killer around while your broken to get good rewards
---
Because they expect ebony mori killers are try hards and it's a lost game anyway. Tbh, green ebonies are already enough. Red ebony moris are not really fun for both sides unless it's a new killer to test his mori.
---
I try and time spirit totems down to injured chases cause I literally never see it on anyone but spirit and no one wants her one shooting you.
---
"Look at a wall? What is this, yellow ranks?"
---
*flashlight stun noise*
---
I did this once, the Ghostface tunneled me and said I ruined his perfect selfie. It was all in good fun, and I can't fault him as I'm a Ghostface main anyway.
---
But don‚Äôt do gens too fast or loop the killer too much because that‚Äôs gen rushing and toxic.
---
üôÑ
---
uh, yeah it‚Äôs big big brain time.
---
Wow how creative
---
Of course haha enjoy.
---
Good at gens? Damm bro
---
Or killer instinct, they were playing legion after all.
---
Tell me about it, if the survivors try to be caught then its game over for me
---
u/Tpupper pointed that out, so I changed it to an optional choice. Read our convo for more info. Besides, this is isn't set in stone, its meant to be a point of conversation.
---
It means the people you played against were sore losers and didn't understand how your perks work. Seriously. 
---
You'd be surprised how many survivors don't get that most Legions will run Discordance and still want to work on the same gen as you. They're idiots. If they did report you, I wouldn't worry about it.
---
T1- 40 seconds

Wym? Are you not a fan of guests or has someone made this post before?

We don't need another killer cute girl.

No that‚Äôs called doing the objective. Looping helps stay alive for a bit.

Laziness. I say the same thing for Overwatch. People on console have keyboard too. Some have just a normal keyboard plugged in for typing messages and there are the attachable mini keyboard for controllers too and has been since PS3 and Xbox360. 
---
DCUO kept its in game chat and it was great. The only reason I can think for other games like these not having them is simply that the devs feel it‚Äôs ‚Äúpointless‚Äù and so they don‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúwasting‚Äù their time. I‚Äôd personally love it if I could have the in game chats on all the pc games that are ported like DBD and Overwatch.

True, I forgot about that
---
That's ghostface
---
Well there‚Äôs like 6 potential survivors that could come with so it‚Äôd be a win win, the more the merrier imo
---
You got to the hatch and didn't use your key there. It looked like mending got in the way of your item prompt, but you should really rebind that. Then you missed your DS, which would've saved you a key.
---
Thought she had decisive. She just got unhooked from the basement and I got both assuming no one was coming to save the other one (because I literally saw her run out), so I was waiting the minute before picking her up. Door was open.
---
Stay out would be useless. More like 20/30/40 since he has no powers that help with chase. And you have to find the hatch which means you won't be gen patrolling.
---
üíî
---
But there is only one survivor left in the match
---
This is broken as fuck... no mother needs to be 3 perks in 1 at the cost of being injured.
---
No mither should leave no blood trail, should make no grunts of pain, of course 24/7 self pick up... that's iron will, unbreakable and and a no bleed perk all in 1 at the cost of being one shot...
---
Removing the disadvantage to a unlimited unbreakable is busted and that idea is ludacris
---
that's what baby players say when they're bigmad about BBQ
---
What? No, I laugh my absolute ass off. There's nothing more satisfying than having someone I'm terrorizing disconnect.

Oh I know. I kept trying to open it but started to mend instead. I don‚Äôt mind losing the key, I found it in a chest anywayü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Not to be melodramatic but if you're a farming killer I'd fucking die for you

This is amazing! ü§£ 
---
I appreciate the credit ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Still, for example if you're against the doctor or clown and you drop the pallet as soon as he comes close to the lunge distance all gens will pop before you use them all. It would make these killers even more unreliable and promotes people to use the nurse as she ignores pallets completely. Recreating pallets isn't a good idea given how strong survivors already are and it would make the game unfun. They already killed stealth in 2016, a new way to play the game would be more fun instead of only looping and then double the loops.
---
&gt;won't ear you much distance on the killer if you don't stun them.
---
And to promote pallet respect? 99% of the time on a long loop or jungle gyms the stun is needed to make the pallet drop. And this perk makes god pallet, jungle gym pallets and long wall pallets near LT walls a nightmare.
---
...This is not good advice
---
Then I underestimated how blazing fast survivors move with Tenacity
---
My only criticism is the fact you called the killers "heroes" lmao
---
Thank you comrade
---
Lol WAT.
---
Hey where did you find it?
---
Can you find other killers models?
---
It‚Äôs just funny when he starts using the word ‚Äúbaby‚Äù or the phrase ‚Äúif you use X, you‚Äôre bad‚Äù.
---
Bitch. You‚Äôre literally relying on ‚Äúmeta‚Äù/‚Äúclutch‚Äù perks. How about you stop using them and show us how good you actually are? IMO, a ‚ÄúGOOD‚Äù survivor doesn‚Äôt rely on meta perks to loop, survive, play. If you die, you die. You don‚Äôt have to win every match. I wonder how he‚Äôd perform if he stopped using meta perks altogether. If he‚Äôs as good as he claims he is, then give us actual good content and not the same stuff literally every other DbD streamers does. AND complains about. Find creative ways to work around the issues, as opposed to complaining about them. 
---
That includes all the Spirit and Nurse complaints.
---
We'll Make It is the one that really frustrates me
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the day when we get Jason. Too bad it couldn‚Äôt be this next chapter: Chapter 13...
---
WHAT is this from, it's fucking glorious
---
Still great if he‚Äôs running Monitor and he is at tier 2, but yeah just practice looking around you while repairing.
---
On a side note, Alert triggers in tier 1 but doesn‚Äôt highlight him, so you could use Alert to gain the knowledge of facing a stealth killer and be more aware.
---
That's what I'm saying...
---
No one should downvote u/13thGuardian ‚Äòs comment just because he had constructive criticism
---
Please make sure to censor usernames. :) Thanks
---
Wow it‚Äôs almost like I played this fabled ‚Äútest build‚Äù and was giving feedback based on it so that my opinions on it could be heard. Funny coincidence.
---
The lore is that the Entity twists and magnifies their powers when taken
---
I never never never never play a killer without all 4 perk unlocks and at least ruin or bbq.
---
Last game survivors complained that is was hapoening specifically when chass started, just like me FPS drop
---
Scarry Game.  If you play it,  you WILL get scars.
---
I‚Äôd say Steeve but sadly Nancy is the better perks. Steve really only has one decent perk.
---
I don‚Äôt think nurses is a very great legion perk as it doesn‚Äôt let you see survivors when they mend, and most people don‚Äôt heal against legion. Considering you‚Äôve upgraded nurse I recommend using thanatophopia, to make them need to waste their time healing
---
I slap on Haunted Grounds on a killer they would least expect it from like cannibal or trapper
---
thanks I‚Äôm definitely gonna do that next time
---
That is why I keep diversion at tier 1. To make fake vaults believable.
---
Just you
---
Oh yeah, I've actually juked killers real bad with that perk several times before, especially when I throw a pallet as they down me which forced them to break the pallet as I make my get away, I even hid behind a tree not 7 meters from the pallet that a Myers never thought to look behind. It's a mid tier perk that isn't seen much, but that's what makes it so annoying for killers when a survivor brings it, they rarely expect it.
---
Be gentle I never used MS Paint for this before.
---
You dont have to answer me If you dont want to but why exactly does it piss you and your friends off?
---
Ah yes. I'm so upset that the game where puking on someone causes them to bleed and hitting them with a chainsaw only causes someone to fall over isn't more realistic.
---
PHOTO BOMB
---
r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I agree the animations do need updating, problem is as people have mentioned in this thread already that if you make the lunges as short as the actual distance then it breaks all the smaller killers and makes them shit.
---
Do they blind the killer? Or do you see fireworks?
---
Work through hex ruin :)
---
I tested and loved this perk during PTB but... people are overestimating the role of Inner Strength in the fight against NOED.
---
Match starts, you see a totem and you cleanse it, activating your IS. A few seconds later, you see another totem. You either leave it in the hope to come back later to get another IS effect or you cleanse it, which wouldn't be much different than what we have now. 
---
If you leave it, you might not get the chance to cleanse it later and NOED will proc or someone else will cleanse it, forcing you to look for another totem if you want to activate IS a second time.
---
While looking for another totem and wasting the same amount of time you do now, you might see a 3rd or 4th totem destroyed and just assume the 5th has also been destroyed, thus activating NOED if the 5th one was still up.
---
I struggle to see all survivors running IS, maybe 2 or 3 at the best. I also struggle to see people without IS NOT cleansing totems because someone else could be running it (outside of SWF). In practice the first 2 totems will be destroyed on sight by IS users, the other 3 nobody knows. 
---
I still love Inner Strength because 8s is insanely fast, specially when you are unhooked inside basement and the killer is coming back. Just pull a quick heal and you should be extra safe if you have DS.
---
Or ‚Ä¶ they use a decoy. 
---
The killer places someone at a gen who looks like one of the other players and appears to working on it but isn't. The second you start working on it, the killer would be notified and could teleport to that gen and reveal themselves to be the thing.
---
I think when she used dead hard it was still active when she vaulted or the exaughsted effect didnt work right, she used lithe and when she got downed it made her go super fast out the door
---
Yes, it is not recommended to tunnel but if so it's my second chance.
---
I run nurses because without getting any kills I don't pip up much. And lower ranks will heal after. So I either see them in frenzy or while they heal when im not in it. It works great to give the lower levels just scares. And most people I go against tell me they enjoy it because they never know where I am and then I'm in front of them with frosty eyes. And honestly at level 46 with legion, that is actually the best perk set up I have because the bloodweb hates me lol.
---
Ye I posted that here, a day ago happening to me, I ran off the map and fell to a random area on the map. Not enough time to try running back to the exit. Happened to another dude same time so no hatch either.
---
I once met a very very new nurse on console. It was probably her first game with nurse. She had an ebony mori but she did not manage to get 1 hook the entire game. The one and only time I felt bad for a killer with an ebony mori.
---
They work literally by getting to Rank 1. Not sure why they even added a progress bar for it honestly, since after rank reset happens it becomes moot and you have to climb back down again.
---
Yea I agree with the commenter saying it is the objective to not be seen, but so are gens and saving your teammate. Also tbagging isn‚Äôt necessary.
---
Meg was like: Ight I‚Äôm bouta head out

I always wondered what would survivors say when the trapper would mention them both Tbagging him?
---
You coulda just put spirit but fair
---
For killer definitely BBQ because I never have any idea where survivors are
---
For survivor it's gotta be Tapp's stake out, easy counter to ruin and it makes other people on the gen think I'm really good at skill checks
---
Ok haha
---
Absolutely! Running around with no terror radius sure is handy.
---
I don't find a lot of them "scary" to be honest, but gameplay wise I'm going to have to say Myers simply because of personal experience. Regardless that I always look around me with the camera, that bastard seems to find me the split second I turn away from wherever he's coming from and yanks me off the gen. I scream like a bitch every time. :/
---
The Cannibal
---
That‚Äôs happened to me before. I had a 5k point game with Leatherface and they said that doing a Daily is no excuse for being trash. I don‚Äôt think I had any addons, was barely into yellow ranks (maybe still grey) as a killer, and had maybe three perks. Meanwhile they were running instaheals and full meta builds.
---
I‚Äôm not salty about what they were running, but it was pretty damn obvious I was a baby killer compared to them. They still insulted me for it. That match actually chased me away from the game for a good two months.
---
17th is the most likely since ptb usually lasts for 2 weeks before a new dlc.
---
I put together a youtube video with some clips from the matches, do you think I could link that here and ask for some constructive criticism? I assume it'll get downvoted to hell, but even if one person likes the video and follows then it's worth it to me :)
---
I'll try look for that streaming guide, thanks!
---
Is he any good? I haven‚Äôt played much since legion came out but i think ghost face looks fun. Not sure if I should get him though.
---
Spirit always creeps me out. The movements and stuff just, ugh.
---
I wonder how many people play this game drunk/otherwise intoxicated. That could explain a lot.
---
Outside the fact he has more movement speed while cloak which helps a ton in a chase and that part about throwing bottles to force survivors off objectives is pure dogshit - it doesnt work like that at all, clown is still loopable just like any other killer in the game and can be Heard from 32 meters unlike wraith
---
Before his buffs he was pretty garbage but now he still needs a buff but is still better then clown
---
After hooking someone plays the voice- ["Just chillin, killin"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6htvI4wnz8) and into the next survivor
---
Hahaha she had no idea where you were ü§£üòÇ
---
Depends a lot on the skill level imo. Really good survivors can definitely loop a plague while broken for longer than they can loop a powered up plague while healthy. Also cleansing takes a lot of time (of course ingesting takes time for the plague too). If a chase only last 10 seconds then the survivor is obviously either trash or he needed to get into a bad position because of bad teammates.

I‚Äôve been hearing the name Otz quite a bit today. I‚Äôve already favorited him, so I‚Äôll definitely keep an eye out when he starts streaming. I don‚Äôt even mind supporting Twitch streamers as long as their internet persona isn‚Äôt too fake and they don‚Äôt sexually harass children, or do some other dumb shit behind closed curtains. And as long as they are actually creative. 
---
Using the same meta perks over and over, not providing creative content, no risk-plays, not trying something new, knowing how to loop the same tiles over and over, that‚Äôs not content. That‚Äôs routine. That‚Äôs like watching the same movie over and over. Every god damn day. Who wants that? 
---
And yeah, when I play with randoms, and I am a solo player, I always try to come up with ways to save them or to keep the killer busy/distracted. Even if it‚Äôs too risky. If I die and the killer gets a free kill, I don‚Äôt care. At least I‚Äôll know that I have tried. And when it actually works, it‚Äôs the biggest ‚ÄúHELL YEAH‚Äù moment ever. Worth it.

---
I can dig it, I like the rationale and construction behind it. Couldn't you just leave the survivor to bleed out though to bypass it?
---
Your portraits are as great as ever! Who‚Äôs going to be next?
---
Of course, and some killers (mostly at rank 1) will do that.
---
impossible
---
The 85 is the number of pips (the things under your rank that show how close you are to the next rank) that are necessary to reach rank 1. You have 26 pips on killer, and unless I'm doing my math wrong, that means you're about halfway through rank 13 right now. Thus, you'll need to gain 12 ranks worth of pips (59 in this case, which will take a minimum of 30 games and almost certainly at least 60 games) to get to rank 1. Don't start now though, because the ranks reset on the 13th.
---

Thx, luckily I had remembered where the hatch was.
---
Using a revolutionary technique you can convert your items into the killers pure rage
---
What's the high reward that no mither has right now?
---
Ohh the amount of pips. Seems like a strange way to calculate it. Thanks!

I don't think Otz realises how wonderful he is to be honest

It's a base perk, you just need to get lucky.
---
slugging an entire no mither squad ? Like what a mad man
---
It's random just keep pushing that bloodweb
---
If we're talking purely cosmetically and sound wise id say the demogorgon as he has that flower mouth and loud screeches when attacking but for lorewise I'd say Ghostface is as he's  seemingly an average person that works an average job but in the night kills the people he's been stalking and when he's done he leaves town and moves on to the next.
---
It‚Äôs random in bloodweb usually not hard to find
---
Just take out ruin at that point, currently it feels thrme whole game is balanced around ruin. Put some other built in slow down in the games.
---
Currently the equation is just not great:
---
No ruin = get rekt
---
*flair checks out*
---
But look at my flair and you'll see who is the REAL waifu
---
Oh absolutely, although it is helpful when trying to plan out how many pips per day you'll need before the ranks reset.
---
Tbh, really really cool
---
Petition to make it take photos
---
I‚Äôd let her live for that
---
17th, as there is a free weekend that starts that day (according to steamdb)
---
That would more than likely encourage tunneling and there's already plenty of that. With Freddy and the Demogorgon, you can teleport to gens now. So it's at least something already in the game.
---
thanks for making me laugh
---
Disagree. Putting Pennywise into the game would have the same effect as the Stranger Things chapter because so many new people would join the game. More players = more revenue = more content. Everyone wins!

Seriously though I just threw it on because I was frustrated that  I was the first hooked 3 times in a row. Never going back

I did read the words but highlighting something in one color that typically means another type of rarity, is misleading is it not?
---
Picking yourself up from dying state
---
That poor legion xD
---
and 'EZ' or 'Baby Killer'
---
Nice, he's fast while cloaked but drastically slows down while uncloaking, giving a lot of time to get to a window or pallet unless he body blocks the pallets, which in a lot of loops still leaves a window and vice versa.
---
And yes, it does work like that. The bottles force medium vaults outside of pallets which can be countered by just breaking them. And yes, he can be heard from 32 meters, like almost every Killer in the game. Not being heard does not mean good or else Ghostface would be the best Killer in the game. 
---
Also, you can literally see Wraith when he's cloaked. Wraith is definitely not better than Clown. Give me one thing Wraith does to stop chases. Map pressure is good and all, but you can't do anything with it if you can't down and hook Survivors in a short period of time.
---
You are downplaying Clown overly hard
---
I do apologise, I haven‚Äôt seen any posts to do with him as I only joined the sub recently, I think he would be cool but the more I think about it anything to do with fear has already been covered with Doctor and Freddy - more for the survivors could have cool synergy perks to do with sticking together and maybe Pennywise could maybe prey more on survivors on their own idk
---
It's probably because Ash was leaked right after she was released so people kinda forgot about the chapter itself and were nutting over Ash

SURVIVOR FOUND

Do you have every killer and survivor p3?

Its An Different Save From The Main Game, there is no reason to not level up everyone

Its like talking to a brick wall with you. I can comprehend the words that I'm reading on a screen, but why color code rarities if they're not gonna accurately represent their rarity? Explain that one for me bud.

I remember that "hard to swallow pills meme from a while back. "The dbd community isn't toxic." Shut drives me nuts
---
Spine Chill is REALLY good when you're having trouble with the game.
---
For the majority of August I played DbD 4 hours at best. When I came back, I was struggling a lot, so I used a Blendette build (Urban + Iron Will + Spine Chill)
---
Then I took off Urban
---
Then Iron Will
---
And now Spine Chill is never leaving my loadout. I stopped blending but it's still REALLY good
---
Did you report them? I had a similar situation, I didn't get banned but I had a message from Sony, it made me wonder if they even bothered to read the stuff the other person wrote. However I will say Sony are usually pretty good with acting on reports whereas BHVR are useless and either make it really long winded to report or find some excuse not to do anything. For this reason I do like the messages being private because at least I know when someone crosses a line something will happen to them.   
---
What I would like is for SOny to implement an option to turn messages off on certain games not just as a whole. I only get issues on DBD.
---
Because the color in this instance represents the tier of the ability, not the tier of the add-on gained
---
Hag is creepiest in game because jumpscares, but doctor or clown are creepiest in my opinion.
---
Just the thought of running around slowly becoming insane or being drugged while running for your life makes me scared.
---
Thats not true because the tier of the ability is the same across all 3 tiers of the perk try again
---
His body change would be interesting as a power
---
Yes they would be both love to work together pennywise gets to eat and fear also have a dinner with clown hag demegorgen and now he can join in the survivor feast and the entity gets sacrifices
---
If it makes you feel any better, only four says until the 13th
---
I honestly cannot take Pennywise seriously. The movies are really funny IMO
---
&gt; He played fair, was outplayed and lost.
---
How was he outplayed? There was nothing he could do in this situation, at all. All the 'survivors' did were the generators while he chased another for less than 20s.
---
That's not being outplayed.
---
As it stands gens are done way to easily by survivors. When the queue times are longer than the game times you know something is up. A little bit ago BHVR put out an update that rewarded survivors for prolonging the game with bloodpoints and XP. I think they need to do more than that, as it didn't fix the issue at hand: Generators are too easy too rewarding to do. 
---
It's no secret that survivor is the easier role in this game.
---
"Survivors" isn't a good name at this point. They're not surviving anything, they do a gen and go onto the next game.
---
Yay. Brown ranks. :/ can't wait. At least there will be some decent players mixed in.
---
 I've been matched with rank 3s and 4s when I was rank 14 üò¢
---
Follow her footsteps and catch her because flashlights really aren't that great
---
Like a fake him chasing surviors and once the clone gets near the phony fakes a hate and the survior screams in fright and gets a balloon attached to them a red one to make it easy to see
---
The tier as in ‚Äúoh hey, that‚Äôs a useful, high tier ability‚Äù. BHVR deems gaining a second add-on to be a useful, ‚Äúvery rare‚Äù ability, thus the color coding, it has nothing to do with the add-on itself, and everything to do with how useful they think it is

No problem, man
---
It's not "the exact same". Wraith can't be revealed out of stealth like ghostface. Wraith goes invisible, ghostface does not. Wraith can use the ability at any time without having to recharge it first. Ghostface's ability is instant. Ghostface can attack instantly without having to uncloak first.
---
It's similar, but the same can be said about many other killer abilities in the game.
---
Honestly I'd just replace "Broken" for "Exposed" and the perk would be great
---
why not
---
Horrors are always super meh, I watch them for the plot more than the scares and the paranormal movement made the genre super cheap for a long time - at least It was an enjoyable film
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Because it‚Äôs the only reason you have to cleanse dull totems, if more perks were like this, everyone would do totems,  but they‚Äôre not
---
Idk man, I usually destroy 3-4 totems at the very start of the game, now I'm going to save them for later.
---
Yeah that's why I like the idea of an immobilize and alert decoy.

He was outplayed because he didn't pressure a single gen. He did not patrol any one of them. In fact there was one being worked in front of his face and he didn't go to it. 
---
He simply played very bad against a team who knew how to do gens. He spent way too long trying to trigger pinkys finger and didnt use PGTW once! he simply played bad for high ranks.

Tunneling is when you pay attention to one person and ignore everyone else like even if they are right in front of you
---
i always thank the killer if they spare me &lt;3
---
&gt; He was outplayed because he didn't pressure a single gen. He did not patrol any one of them.
---
You're wrong, he did. He even hooked one of them in the first minute. Two of them kept busy by his first chase. He pressured more than well enough. But it still wasn't enough, because he simply cannot be in four places at the same time. That's the reality of playing killer. Unless the survivors go out of their way to gather in one place, you will never pressure all of them. It's wrong of you to assume he could have.
---
He pressured two of them pretty well at the start. Even if he had hit his pinkys on the first hit on every survivor it would not have bought him enough time. 
---
You're wrong on this point.
---
I sense a mori in here future
---
HAHAHA okay.
---
I'd call tunneling targeting one single person the entire game, no matter what, not even going to kick gens
---
The broken symbol means that no competent killer is going to slug you
---
Well I mean he wears a white mask and is 7 feet tall( I think that's how tall Micheal is) so they really don't matter as he's steal really noticable

Thank you for your constructive feedback.

Overall, there seems to be more newer players than veterans. I mean, on Reddit, we have plenty of posts of people being happy about double pips and shrine of secret stuff. Games as the killer at rank 6-8 seem easier than I remember without having good perks or playing with the top notch killers. Discord channel seems to have a lot of 30 in-game hours players.
---
Going after a single survivor no matter what gets in your way. Ignoring other survivors that you could easily hit or start chasing in favor of continuing to go after the survivor you first hit/hooked/started chasing
---
We're gonna live forever can help you get bloodpoints to level up him and others fast
---
When is it?
---
Dead hard and We‚Äôre gonna live forever (or whatever the bloodpoint perk is). The other two are whatever you want. We‚Äôll make it (the hook healing perk) is good with the latter.
---
That‚Äôs the risk
---
And with the risk comes the reward, you also leave no blood and have lowered grunts
---
I‚Äôm not saying no mither is a godlike perk, i‚Äôm just saying it has it‚Äôs uses, and just saying ‚ÄúNo competent killer will X‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean the perk is worthless, it just means it doesn‚Äôt always get it‚Äôs opportunity, but that makes the moments where it comes into play even more satisfying
---
Shaddup Meg.
---
Exactly right. Wear the one you like, but I find bloody cosmetics ugly as hell personally. I guess they're ok for licensed killers without cosmetics.
---
Botany Knowledge (provided you have some med-kits). A yellow one with Tier 3 heals twice and a Gauze Roll heals 3 times. You use it to get survival points quickly while not dealing with the slow heals of self-care. You can also heal others faster for altruism points.
---
Prove Thyself. You get double co-op points whether it's on a gen or healing a survivor together. It's mainly used for objectives so you don't end up with games getting no objective points.
---
Deliverance. Helps you gain survival points and a solid perk if you get it to activate.
---
We're Gonna Live Forever. 25% for each token on it. This pairs especially well with Botany as you can take a hit while a survivor is on the killer's shoulder then heal up quickly after.
---
no mither
---
Dont worry about that, basically past the first Tier up youre always going to be seen. Its about positioning and knowing when to stalk during a loop/chase more than your outfit
---
Yes, and nurse with no add ons can end a match in that time, but you‚Äôll never hear tru3 say nurse isn‚Äôt balanced.
---
Besides, he had PGTW and didn‚Äôt kick a single gen. Says he outplayed the survivors at every pallet when he very clearly didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs just salty lol
---
Yeah when you farm you get two hooks and then don‚Äôt kill anyone (or maybe just kill one person)
---
That depends on how effectively we summon
---
Sadly it wouldn‚Äôt work against SWF
---
the first question isn't supposed to have "at home"
---
They were for me too, lol. Honestly, you can see most scares from a mile away, especially when a Loser talks to some random person away from everyone else. It‚Äôs like okay that is definitely Pennywise in disguise again for the 34th time.
---
The only thing scary was the hate crimes/bullying imo
---
I got: Dark Sense, Kindred, Resilience, This is Not Happening, Small Game, Borrowed Time and Unbreakable.
---
&gt; Besides, he had PGTW and didn‚Äôt kick a single gen. 
---
Every gen completed were on the other side of the map. He didn't use it because he couldn't use it.
---
Even if he did, that wouldn't stop those other four generators from being completed as fast as they were. There's no debating that.
---
You don't win here mate. There was nothing he could do.
---
Borrowed time is pretty good with We're gonna live forever making, unbreakable is situational but still pretty good. I'd say run borrowed,WGLF,dead hard and once you get the fourth slot unbreakable

I've been using We're Gonna live forever, Kindred and Dark Sense.. I'm kinda trash at getting away from the killer so bringing a toolbox and relying on Dark Sense has been my savior.
---
Screw you
---
üóø
---
Yeah, although I like the idea of a fear meter kinda like the doctor or Freddy. Maybe the longer you spend chasing it slowly grows, hitting a survivor/being in the terror radius when a survivor is hit/downed makes it jump. When the fear meter is filled they get exposed like ghostface. I think that with a Frantic Rush ability would make a balanced killer. The fear meter can stay on and depending on how much it‚Äôs filled survivors can calm each other down. 
---
Or he could be even more like doc and the more fear you have  you randomly see a copy of the killer/a survivor. All I know is in the 2017 movie there‚Äôs a heartbeat in it that would be awesome if added. It‚Äôs a little deeper and the chase music would be really cool. With the new movie now a survivor can be added and I guess the map could be the carnival.
---
in any other game being able to complete the main objective quickly is seen as a skill. in DBD it's cheating. k.
---
## bruh ü§°ü§°ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
There was very much he could do. Stop pretending he is a god, he isn‚Äôt, he played poorly, simple as that.
---
And like I said,  this game is very much an exception, just like those when nurse ends a game in this time.
---
*Nea*
---
Tunneling is choosing to keep going after the same survivor until they are dead. 
---
This usually comes up right after an unhook and often gets confused with camping which is a whole different conversation. Note: the word "choosing" in the definition. In order for a killer to be tunneling, they have to know or at least have a decent idea where another survicor is is. It has to be a concious choice to pass up other survivors in order to quickly down and kill the same person (basically, just think of old Dying Light where you needed to kill the obsession ASAP to get it to work).
---
Tunneling is NOT:
---
- Going after the survivor that got unsafely unhooked if the other survivors all hid and made no effort to take the aggro
---
- Downing and slugging the injured survivor if the killer catches survivors group healing
---
- Hooking the same survivor 3 times in a row because they kept playing aggressively and didn't value their life enough while on death hook/ suck at avoiding the killer
---
&gt;How was he outplayed? There was nothing he could do in this situation, at all. All the 'survivors' did were the generators while he chased another for less than 20s.
---
For starters his ruin was taken out early and if he was counting on that ... shame on him. He's better then that. It could have gone the other way had they not found it. I can't speculate on what he could have done without knowing for sure if it was a SWF group he was up against. Personally, I don't want them grouped with me as a solo player either and there isn't much you can do without negatively impacting  solo players. You need to separate them. 
---
&gt;"Survivors" isn't a good name at this point. They're not surviving anything, they do a gen and go onto the next game.
---
The objective of the game is for survivors to do gens everything else is optional. You're are literally arguing against the entire point of the game for survivors.  
---
Regardless, there are maps that simply don't favor either side depending on the gen placement etc ... this is one map that does favor survivors more. There are also perks that don't work well with certain killers either. Whatever he was running didn't work. 
---
Like I said, we all have bad games and the only negative about this match was the way they treated him at the end after he played a fair match. Just leave.
---
In DBD you're punished for ending the game quickly as survivors. Unfortunately for you, DBD isn't league of legends or CSGO.
---
The main objective isn't to escape, it's to *survive*. People tend to forget that. Survivors can still "win" the match even if they die. A test of skill in DBD is seeing how long players can survive against the killer.
---
Nea
---
&gt; There was very much he could do.
---
By all means, explain what he could have done.
---
&gt; just like those when nurse ends a game in this time.
---
You're correct nurse is also broken. However she's confirmed to be getting a rework. Gens are not.
---
Yeah it's a pretty useful perk I tend to run in all of my builds when I'm running solo.
---
I did report them. Like I said. They messaged me first, and kept sending some vile messages. And when I finally told them to fuck off and blocked and then reported them, I was banned literally within an hour later. And no, they never responded to my report meaning the person was never banned, only I was. I don‚Äôt go around sending hate, had never even been issued a warning before.
---
I know, it‚Äôs the same as tunnelling, it‚Äôs just killing people faster.
---
If we could get the Halloween 3 masks for Micheal it would be a cool callback, even if he never existed in that universe
---
&gt; Again my point stands, he did NOT pressure any gens.
---
Again, you're incorrect. Pressuring survivors is pressuring gens, given a survivors only side objective is to do a generator.
---
This is a joke right?
---
Killers really rush and swing wildly when haunted grounds is expiring. I had my most amazing chase while I was just running for my life for the whole 60 seconds
---
Legion.... oh wait.
---
No, they really should just take out all survivor perks so it will be Balanced.
---
Id use unbreakable, borrowed time, and dead 'ard
---
last time i saw a monto video all he did was whine constantly and then complain when survivor got hatch
---
he runs ruin every build and acts like its interesting content
---
idk just not my type of content creator i guess
---
otz was the first killer content creator that i thought played in a really fair way while not running a shitload of crutches and still having a good time with it
---
Spine chill is actually a fantastic perk to know if the killers heading your way or chasing someone and it's also good in chases to know if they are still chasing you or mindgaming.
---
Tapp, All stranger things characters,
---
Yeah i wasn't sure if they even were being toxic because they wouldn't teabag, just jump in.
---
Classic *BABY* killer. Next you will say noed should be buffed.
---
Before Freddy change I had someone waiting who was awake. I waited for him to jump in but he must've thought he was safe with the putting to sleep thing or that I couldn't shut it, I dunno. Point being I did and he ran and died lmao
---
If this post and your comment was an attempt at sarcasm, you have failed miserably.
---
Lmao let them be hooked
---
I play both survivor and killer, and honestly i feel like this game is not balanced right now. I mean, if you are a really good killer with spirit or nurse you can destroy rank 1 teams, but if you are avarage survs can just bully you. Now noed will be useless cuz everyone will just destroy totems in order to heal, nurse calling will have an indirect nerf, again cuz of the new perks that heal without an animation. Just nerf adrenaline, both speed and healing is too strong. Borrowed time is also an annoying perk, but i guess it prevents tunneling. With all these issues they are going to give 6 new surv perks, well, gg i guess

I think Puppers is fine, DbD can be really tilting sometimes.
---
More than anything though I think Puppers, monto, and noob all have really cringey communities like jeesus I can't watch any of them stream for longer than half an hour because of how bad the donos are. Couldn't imagine trying to put on a grateful face for 8 hours a day with some of the shit they get said to them.
---
&gt; Literally ever since Spirit came out, that was when I started having serious trouble with this game as a survivor.
---
Maybe you're just not actually very good at the game then? Being able to easily beat 14/16 killers consistently doesn't mean you're some god, it just means those killers are just so weak. I find it hilarious that by your own admission the moment they introduce a killer that breaks the standard meta or can't be beaten the same way you scream BROKEN. lol, get gud.
---
Did you read my whole reply, friend? 
---
I said he pressured the wrong survivors! He only attacked two survivors, who which were doing NOTHING. That means there was three survivors pumping away at gens while he threw a bunch of bottles at some guy in the middle of a field.
---
This is NOT how you pressure what-so-ever, hence why gens flew by and he lost the game.
---
It he put adequate pressure he would not have lost as badly as he did, understand? 
---
Rotation, rotation, rotation. The most important thing for a killer to do. What did True do? Throw bottle, throw bottle, throw bottle. This really ain't it Chief.
---
I thought blood hunts usually start on a Friday/Saturday? (cough cough 15th cough cough)
---
Good to know. I thought the skill check difficulty increase wouldn't be worth the trade. I guess you just got to get good if you want to use it efficiently.
---
Calling Plague the worst killer is a massive stretch. A lot of the perks actually have their uses as well. Zubat likes to use Infectious Fright on Nurse and does wonders with it. Dark Devotion admittedly doesn't see a lot of use but sounds amazing on paper. Corrupt Intervention many people consider a viable alternative to Ruin, though it's now rivalled by Thrilling Tremors. 
---
Plague is easily mid-tier and there are arguably many killers that are worse. Trapper's strength is mostly add-on and survivor awareness based, Pig keeps receiving nerfs, Wraith was low tier for the longest time, Leatherface has an awful power but excellent perks to make up for it, Freddy was busted for over a year, etc. 
---
You contradict yourself a ton in this comment. I still see more Jane's running around than I do Plague. People only don't know how to counter Plague because she's almost never played. I guarantee she probably has the lowest pick rate out of any other character. She's probably only rivalled by Leatherface for lowest pick rate.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt ;0
---
youre right it wouldnt have because true has a serious problem(like many killer mains) of thinking "i have ruin that means i can just completely ignore gens and they wont get done"
---
he IGNORED gens the ENTIRE GAME what was supposed to happen? if he wants survivors that don't do gens maybe he shouldnt be a red rank killer. god knows he already whines like he's in yellow ranks
---
&gt; This really ain't it Chief.
---
You clearly didn't read my reply.
---
If he'd left the two survivors he kept busy alone, they would have gone and done gens as soon as he'd left. Leaving him in a much worse position.
---
You're wrong on this point. No amount of rotations would have stopped the survivors.
---
I also hate noed, but hey, if you meet an adrenaline-ds-bt-dead hard team it is completly justified
---
He used facecam for some of his Outlast videos. He's a cool guy but there is definitely something subtly off about the way his face looks.
---
For me, he's been fun on the game, where there is practically no LOS. He can make some sneaky plays, and can tbag back if necessary. Not bad by any means, but definitely not spirit.
---
i agree with sir or madam, survivors are too strong and should have  only gotten 3 perks, i mean 6 op perks? smh my head
---
My bad, that‚Äôs actually a complete coincidence.
---
 the skill check difficulty is only slightly noticable so it won't effect you that much.
---
I miss Tom.
---
Think of it this way, ghost face came out without a survivor, this is just balancing that.
---
Guarentee you that David, Bill, Ash and Laurie would kill the Legion if they grabbed the axes inside lockers
---
&gt; ENTIRE GAME
---
Seems like you forgot the entire game is over in 4 minutes and 30s.
---
So is the entity a species? Does it need to breed?
---
I don't think you understand the point of the game for survivors. So I'll just post it here so there's no further confusion. How you play is your business, however nothing I said was wrong. 
---
&gt;The aim of the survivor is to find and repair several generators scattered across the map in order to power the exit gates required to escape!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The killer's aim is to find and catch survivors in order to place them on meat hooks on the map so they can be sacrificed to "The Entity". A mysterious being that feeds off the hope of the survivors trapped in its realm.

---
&gt;Ohhh so now he's just unlucky? I thought you said he was outplayed?
---
I never changed my point, I just added some additional context to make clear that there are more factors that come in to play. However the strategy starts the second you choose your character and pick your build going in. He choose poorly and was outplayed the entire match by players who were doing the objectives. 
---
Which is what they were supposed to do. Those are not mutually exclusives concepts bud. 
---
Also I said nothing negative about the man, and I can't see how you'd even insinuate that from anything I did say. Again, we all have bad games. As a survivor main for almost 2 years, I've seen it go the other way plenty of times. Enough so, that this isn't an issue. If it is for you, perhaps you need to up your game and start putting together builds that will nullify this from happening.
---
You act surprised or upset that not being at the top of your game with a high skill cap character is going to lead to you not performing well. This whole thread is a goddamn mess.
---
Shut up, Meg.
---
Why such the hard-on for tru? The guy lost. Big deal. Stop defending his crappy gameplay.
