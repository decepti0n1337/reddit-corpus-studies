Thank you! It's actually my first time ever receiving it! People here are so nice

---
That‚Äôs honestly a hot enough vid that it‚Äôs considered porn
---
There are like, 3 red rank survivors left after the update.  You literally cannot find an equally ranked team. 
---
If anything you should be able to read the auras of your hooks similarly to how the trapper can see his traps. 
---
Claudette is a healer
---

---
Don't reduce her to her physical traits   :(
---
Good to know
---
First time ever playing against a Myers i was like "why is he so slow? I think he's friendly" 
---
\*ruin
---
No issues with me so far. I‚Äôm on a pro if that makes any difference.
---
The times I have run NOED, if theres only 1 gen left I can wait until NOED activates to do the hit. You can tell people are running adrenaline when they don't heal around the end as well.
---
save the best for last is very, very good on clown, don't sleep on it. i run variations of:
---
ruin / bbq / enduring / spirit fury
---
bbq / stbfl / enduring / spirit fury
---
as for add ons, you really can't go wrong with the feathers, ethers, flask of bleach, and the solvent jug. redhead's is great, but avoid tattoo's.
---
r/coaxedintoasnafu ?
---
I‚Äôm on standard PlayStation at the moment but I‚Äôm gonna try my pro in my living room to see if it makes a difference. 
---
I think ruin on Mixtape Legion is kinda toxic. Because the only thing survivors can do is genrush. Same with Ruin-Nurse. 
---
nerfing ds is understandably shit but if they nerf unbreakable i stg 
---
Thanks. I hope I was able to give a clear enough description in words of what I had in mind.
---
The one thing I think I dislike the most is that for other killers to have one hits on survivors they either need an add-on (Huntress) or a perk (NOED/Devour Hope, if I'm incorrect on Devour Hope then let me know) but all you need to do against The Plague is... Heal in a fountain.. a thing that is in your best interest if you don't want to be slower, louder, and more visible in terms of leaving blood or infecting stuff. You can't heal when you're completely infected, which is fine, but it does really bother me that without any sort of add-on, perk, or offering, she just has One-Hit-Spit. To each their own, however. I'm not here to tell anyone they're wrong. Just to explain my reasons.
---
I‚Äôd be interested to know if it does so I can stick on my pro till the next patch.
---
&gt;Could you *be* any louder?
---
New killer, Miss Chanandler Bong
---
I also play mostly solo, it's actually nice since you have to rely on strangers. It can be frustrating but also a lot of fun. And I have met people to play with through this.
---
Just git gud and stop whining
---
... You can hear totems? What are you, part bat? 
---
Preparing us for Ash..

[removed]
---
Honestly if you just do gens and hide all game the only person deranking is you. I don‚Äôt know why this is such a difficult concept to grasp. A quick ended game on either side is not a test of skill. You didn‚Äôt prove any of your skill by just holding Repair until the gates opened vs a less than interactive killer. Also if everyone died on first hook with little to no chases and no jukes or interaction, the killer didn‚Äôt prove any skill. They walked forward and downed someone for running in a straight line. Those aren‚Äôt demonstrations of skill, that‚Äôs just being asleep at the wheel. 
---
That kind of gameplay will give you a safety pip at best in the reds now and I‚Äôll keep it 100, that‚Äôs miles better than what was going on in red ranks before. Wait for a lobby for 10 minutes, get tunneled and die in three minutes and the killer gets rewarded? Like huh? 
---
But sure focus on a false point about deranking. Classic diversion. 
---
What are u talkin about,this is obviously correct 
---
Okey doke
---
oof xD
---
happy cake day
---
I get what you mean. I actually still haven't faced a plague yet(survivor queue times ugh) but it seems to me like it'll be super frustrating to go up against the plague when she has corrupt purge. Nothing you can do to stop it other than just run and try to break line of sight
---
Im assuming vomit resets bloodlust like huntress hatchets?
---
Maybe the models for menu and in game are different? I did scale them both to the same piece of terrain as Adiris. Might be why. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Did you have a third person to compare the heights?
---
hmm, i got a merciless as plague in which i killed all survivors (one bled to death, 3 hooked to death) and the emblems were gold, gold, iridecent, iridecent. is that not enough? im gonna try again now after the update came out for PS4. it's the only trophy i have left
---
Yeah our screens are right next to each other and I was actually kinda shocked by how tall the spirit actually is lol
---
My jason concept:
---
(When i mention stuns im including flashlight blinds)
---
 Jason killer ability would be his rage meter. It would decrease stuns, flashlight blinds, and reduce attack cooldowns. Some thing that can be built up over the game. A rage meter that jason fills as he chases suvivors and when he is stunned. The higher the rage mode meter fills the more of a decreases to the effectiveness of killer stuns as well as decreasing attack cooldowns, but keeping his movement speed the same. Kinda like having enduring, shadowborn, unrelenting, (or any other similar perk abilities could be supplemented here) but combined in a killer ability.  
---
  The rage meter would fill slowly in a chase, and quickly if he is stunned, hit with a pallet, blinded, ect. Filling the rage meter would be really hard and take most of the game so its mostly a endgame tactic. The reduction to stuns and blinds should be similar to what you could get from already existing perks and not much stronger if at all. Additionally if jasons rage meter is full, once stunned he will enter a rage mode which will grant him a speed boost (imagine something closer to legions frenzy speed but not nearly as long of a duration) and immunity to stuns, once rage mode ends it goes on cooldown like an exhaustion perk would but the rage meter stays full
---
 This would also allow for good add ons: 
---
 fill the meter faster while in a chase,
---
fill the meter an extra amount when stunned,
---
 increase the duration of rage mode but significantly increase the time it takes to fill the meter,
---
 an ultra rare add on to give jason the ability to kill a survivor by his hand in rage mode (depleting a large chunk of the rage mode when doing so),
---
Rage mode increases when a survivor is unhooked while jason is X meters away from the hooked survivor
---
Just a few add on ideas i had, thought of more but not sure, these seem the easiest to balance.
---
Add ons should be balanced so that add ons would come in different rarities with differnt rates of effectiveness. Ideally jason would be weak with out add ons at all but strong with good add ons. 
---
This would give us a killer that isnt too similar to anyother killer atm. It would be a good for those swf trolling the killer groups cuz the more you are looped and stunned the stronger he gets. 
---
This would allow for more creative builds and incorporate low end perks in his abilities that normally you wouldnt wanna waste a perk slot on. Shadowborn unrelenting to name a few. 
---
Balancing this killer would be easy enough, cuz he will only be strong if you are actually chasing survivors. I like him with a constant speed except in rage mode cuz this makes him significantly different from michael play wise you dont have to stalk, you just chase people and your meter builds. 
---
Camp crystal would be a cool idea for a map too so i like this idea.
---
Yep just saw it. Is she the Wraith's mommy?
---
Oh shit i didnt reslise, thanks.
---
Finding matches hard? Level 10 killer keep getting level 5 below players and it's really annoying with t-bagging 
---
Oh okay, have to bear that in mind then. They must have separate models for both! Either Rin is tall or Meg is really ^smol
---
I didn't notice this was indeed changed. These new ones are bullshit, and the survivors ones seem to be the same.
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Perhaps the up the scale of survivors so we can see their cosmetics better ?
---
Could be interesting.
---
Oh no ill take an m1 instead of getting one shot. Darn.

I don't even have ruin as a teachable because I don't level hag and I don't use noed because it's better to finish the game before they get all the gens. Self care is the mkst crutch perk in the game, Everybody uses it, even I do when using survivor so don't tell me ruin and noed are crutch.  I don't camp but I can see why people do. It's not worth having your game ruined by some Ochido wannabe who'll message you afterwards with a "GG EZ BABY KILLER" It's not fun to play against, but neither is getting looped for the entire game. Either ALL toxicity is banned, Or none of it is. Camping, is toxic. So is pallet looping.
---
Last note: there's a difference between looping and running. 
---
yea but michael is seen in the video so lol
---
PATCH NOTES:
---
*"Increased Megs physical height from 5' 2" to 6' 5""*
---
I‚Äôve seen a rise in swf hitting my lobbies and pulling in higher ranks, so a bit more toxicity but that‚Äôs no different than when I play at a high rank killer (I stay mid level so I can have more fun instead of having to feel grindy and making it not as fun for the survivors as well), It just makes sense that with the new system and ranking there‚Äôs gonna be some people who are scattered about where you normally wouldn‚Äôt see them.
---
r/godhasleftus
---
Yeah, but he lost a fight to a cancerous old guy in bath robes and a spiteful hospital orderly, while also having severe breathing problems. He's not just "a bit out of shape."
---
Funny thing is, even if they did teabagged before, they would have gotten what they deserve in this case if Nurse wasn't hitting them
---
Ew. Legion.
---
I think NOED is fair and perks in general just need to be closer to NOEDs level of strength for both survivors and killers.
---
Thank. God. 
---
I'll review it. Got nothing better to do.
---
This happened to me yesterday. I'm on ps4 too. I was on the mount Ormond map and had invisible skill checks the whole match. 
---
And I'm keep getting high ranks (purple) SWF. It's really annoying after the update. 
---
This play is something to obsess over. Great job, great play. uWu Baby.
---
Try checking for update, one just dropped within the last hour on ps4 1.57
---
Nice but the problem is you decreased the timer significantly. Why? It should keep the timer and just make it stun for 5 seconds at tier 3. Enduring shouldnt affect it. That's all it needs.
---
*"Mommy only listens to big brother, she always ignores me!"* is a dumb sentiment to share, but yeah I guess it is pretty civil, no argument there. 
---
They make a crispy sizzle, no joke.
---
Hello. There's some things I wanna explain.
---
This chapter is the only for the whole year, as the rest of the year is focused on big bug patches and optimization.
---
This chapter and the new terms are meant to raise money for dedicated servers, which will, along with the new matchmaking system, make finding games faster and better.
---
What you are complaining about are hitboxes.
---
Honestly, servers might make this more pleasant, but there's no confirmation that it's gonna change. (this due to the fact hitboxes were always a pain to balance, especially on assimetrical games) 
---
That‚Äôs not at all what I said. And You can take your ‚ÄúI‚Äôm big bad Killer main‚Äù anger out of here, Friend. 
---
You don't. You accept the fact that you got outplayed by a skilled killer.
---
David absolutely has the best ones
---
I posted an update to it on this subreddit, it should be in my posts :)
---
Using that same logic, instead of doing that maybe if we just throw enough fits we'll get our way. That's what the killers did.
---
You got 54 upvotes, so clearly I'm missing something...
---
What is this joke referring to?
---
It's exactly the point of your post, you're a little sore that BHVR only listens to killers in your view and treats you and your buddies like second class citizens. I mean I think it's a stupid point to share, but I do agree that you were civil in writing it I guess. I don't know it seems a little whiny, weak and helpless to me. 
---
Of course that's a thing
---
Out of all the stupid shit they could have added. I can't stand their falling voices, what are they scared of? There's no falling damage lol
---
ok im gay so i know im not supposed to find her attractive
---
but i just dont see the appeal of a giant ass and bouncing tits 
---
the best looking female survivo IMO is kate
---
‚ÄúSee survivor aura in locker,‚Äù 
---
Now I could be wrong here, but lockers block any form of aura reading so this is kinda doubtful.
---
Are you sure they changed it? I didn't get the Plague trophy on PS4 recently with 4 kills, but in the patch notes from today it said they fixed a bug about Adept killer trophies not unlocking. It should probably work as usual now.
---
Damn there's really no irony in this post is there.
---
Survivors have been whining about NOED for a long time and the devs said no to changing it. So... good luck with that, lol. 
---
Legion sucks meh cack
---
Tfw shadow born isn‚Äôt considered meta but feels like heaven
---
You forgot Ash
---
That is how you turn most trappers into slashers
---
I think you calling it a stupid point is pointless, everyone feels differently. I‚Äôve got reason to feel this way as we‚Äôve seen in previous patches, survivors have factually received more nerfs than buffs and killers the opposite. And sure, you can call it helpless. I can‚Äôt change anything. There is no help. So I vented a little under the thread agreeing with the OP. No harm there. 
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion? But I think that they did a pretty good job with Laurie‚Äôs voice, it sounds pretty close to JLC, her face is actually pretty good to me too given they don‚Äôt have her likeness rights and Michael looks really good too. It actually is the best licensed dlc followed by the Saw chapter I think. 
---
That hatch was pulled out an 80s bathroom.  Damn it, entity. 
---
The only thing on that list that wasnt completely unbalanced was DS, at least in my opinion. 
---
You are correct that killers have been getting significantly better perks each chapter than survivor has been getting. People wonder why survivors run the same 4 perks but they're literally the only useful things when we keep getting crap. 
---
It's whatever though. The game is getting easier and thus more fun for killers and really that's what matters.
---
I seen the aura just as she got in.
---
I don't use decisive myself, however the only real change I would like is the stun to be increased or the current stun to not be shortened by enduring. I've seen the videos of the Dstrike hitting and the guy makes it 10 feet and just down again. That is ridiculous.
---
Or I'd be okay if they merged unbreakable with Dstrike to stop the slug then wait.
---
Although your suggestion of pausing the time while dying state would work for that too.
---
The times shortened I don't see a need for or resetting if someone else is hooked.
---
Does the NPC meme still have juice left in it? You guys are on-script tonight. 
---
"This stall is occupied!" 
---
take heed travalor, as you will find a world without legion 
---
I decreased the timer to balance out the fact that it doesn't go down in chase, odds are that if you are going down 30+ seconds after you get unhooked without going into chase, you probably aren't getting tunneled, and are more like getting unlucky, and the killer isn't able to find who unhooked you. 
---
I agree that enduring shouldn't affect it, but 5 seconds is a little much. 4 Seconds and not being affected by enduring is a good middle in my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs perfect as is. Get used to it and quit being a whiny little twat.
---
That's fair, sometimes I get frustrated at the game too, I just think it's weird to feel as helpless as some of you seem to ITT while playing survivor, balance seems like it's in a better place than it's ever been to me, but like you said I guess everyone feels differently. 
---
Git gud
---
get whore, i ain't paying 5 bucks for a 4.99 blowjob
---
its been ages since ive watched the og evil dead films, but is this new DLC going to be based on the newer character or the og one?
---
That's all I want, buddy :)
---
Platform:PC. 
---
Type of Bug: Ingame 
---
Description: Sometimes during a match, the "Heal" option does not appear on some survivors. It is the survivor that bugs, because I've been able to heal different people. It can happen to people in Injured AND Dying state, which would make you a slug forever. When it happens while you are a slug, you don't get the "Recover" option either.
---
Steps to reproduce: Playing the game (lag?)
---
Reproduction rate: 1/10 Matches 
---
System Specs: Win10 Enterprise, I7-6700K, GTX 1070, 16GB DDR4 Ram, SSD &amp; HDD. All drivers up to date
---
I'm going to sidestep your strawman and just mention that you're really planning on crying loudly to mommy and daddy and that you're acting like a silly lil' baby right now. 
---
This is what I don't understand. How does it take me 3x as long to find a lobby if I'm still playing with rank 15s as a rank 3?
---
Can confirm this, you can still see survivor aura‚Äôs if they‚Äôre in the animation of getting in the locker. It only blocks the aura it if they‚Äôre already inside 
---
Had this happen to me a few weeks ago on mount ormond map then again on lampkan lane 
---
My killer heart broke 
---
I got this against a bad freddy. It feels good. Its a trophy I thought I'd never get. I'm on PS4 only 2 trophies mock me still killing 4 people with myers tombstone and 100 downs with huntress hatchets from 24+ meters.
---
Things you did wrong or not well:
---
That time you tried to hit Claudette through the window wasn't a great attempt. She was already halfway through the window when you lunged. You should've attacked Adam while he was body blocking instead of tunneling. I would've waited to phase wall at the end until I looked around with BBQ&amp;C for Feng's aura.
---
Things you did correctly or well:
---
It was smart slugging Claudette for a few seconds while you attacked Adam. It was smart going on the other side of the window Adam was going for. 
---
You're right. I can't argue with a killer. Sorry. I'll go back to the hook.
---
you're ez, stick to crying about perks in the forum console player
---
"Doing gens, you?"
---
Maybe I'm just losing it
---
Lol you're as passive-aggressive as a tilted ex girlfriend. 
---
The hex totems make a faint crackling fire sound. So not only do they glow orange and typically spawn 20 feet from survivors, they also be doing some crackle-lackling.
---
I mean, I am salty. It's not fun having the game you enjoyed playing constantly make your experience feel like trash. Solo survivor makes you want to literally just hook yourself, but apparently I'm not allowed to voice my complaints but killers are. 
---
Its whatever. Sorry for the rant.
---
When there‚Äôs 2 survivors left, I‚Äôve found enough killers try to slug me to lure other altruistic survivors over for healing. I‚Äôve found it such a clutch perk.
---
Dwight looks pretty cool in that picture.
---
I understand that. And I‚Äôm not saying survivor nerfs weren‚Äôt warranted, Exhaustion nerf was 100% needed. Being able to lose the timer while still running around was not only logically incorrect compared to how it is now, it also could make chases near impossible for the killer to end them, for example. 
---
Idk about the matchmaking because I'm having a blast being able to play a game in under 3 mins instead of waiting the usual 40 mins. 
---
That's like saying GTA shouldn't be made because a bunch kids decided to rob a bank after doing a heist in GTAV. Yes that actually happened.
---
I think you played fine for the most part. Everything else is just the game sense and decision making. I guess the more you play the better your game sense (e.g. knowing when to go across the map or moving away and ability back to the hook. Work on your tracking abilities, you lose survivors in the phase quite quickly. 
---
Makes sense then, nvm
---
Billy's who run Noed need to rethink their life decisions.
---
I dont get it
---
Not who I was referencing, but eh. 
---
distant oof
---
care to explain?
---
Good to know. &lt;3
---
I will too if u send video and discord maybe
---
The problem is everybody wants specific"good" hiding spots but there's only so much. Without the randomness the placements will then become predictable 
---
Oh, now I heard it. lol 
---
Aw dang, you're right though. I just put Hillbilly 'cause of the Southern style lmao
---
Yeah I can respect that. I love to support creators as well. My reasoning for using iridescent shards is that it makes me appreciate having the character more than if I paid.
---
He makes a fair point. Players should probably be shown one another's ranks...
---
Nope no thank you
---
Some hits are sketchy, but the worst is by far hits from Nurses. Absolutely horrid. No touching me whatsoever and it still connects anyway 
---
do you guys know if this exists on PC? Might be the last hidden Im missing
---
Also global indication NOED is at play before it's too late and we have basics towards NOED balancing. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Regarding OP message, DS needed a rework, getting stunned for 5 seconds (or however long it was) was not fun against skilled survivors and using mandatory enduring lessend the perk choices for many. 
---
Same with NOED. Skilled killers with NOED are basically survivors with pre-rework DS. 
---
If you‚Äôre complaining about grinding for cosmetics you must be a child. Cosmetics mean nothing to me. Why do I need some flashy stupid cosmetic to stand out as a survivor, or skin that I can‚Äôt even see because I‚Äôm a killer. Cosmetics have no baring on anything. If you run a business you hold understand why they do thing the way they do. Are you so stupid that you don‚Äôt understand that they are a company that is growing that needs funding after buying their company off of another Company. The fact they still give you an option to grind, which I have no problem doing is great. Call of duty making random weapon drops in a loot box system to give players the chance to destroy with a pay to win weapon is a cash grab. But giving the option for an alternative rout makes it far from a cash grab. 
---
Possibly check your RAM and/or gfx card RAM.
---
Just another thing killers would check before dodging a lobby.
---
She's jacking it in Penn Asylum
---
No but seriously I play her daily. Idk why I havnt gone against her alot either 
---
I had something similar happen to me last night. The totem was uncleansable except for one pinpoint spot. I'd say almost 50% of the totem was exposed too.
---
Lucky. I‚Äôm getting nothing but Bing Bong Boi and Michael. I even got 2 Freddy‚Äôs who are usually pretty rare. 
---
I think that's just a region thing. My survivors are less than 1 min and my killers are estimated at 4 mins.
---
Aaaaaans that's the reason we don't slug boyz
---
Oh
---
RIP me
---
Thanks, lol
---
I imagine I would probably sound like Jeff as my knees couldn‚Äôt take the impact and I collapse. 
---
Real!
---
came to ask this too, i was like i‚Äôve never been able to get up! maybe i‚Äôll start playing as bill, that was nice.
---
Reported for hacking!....wait nvm you good fam 
---
I run unbreakable on pc and usually get to use it every other match or so. Rank 1 in the seasons before rank rework and am currently rank 5. Killers are hella fucking sweaty now and almost every match ends in 2 or 3 people getting slugged after 1 person gets tunneled until death hook. 
---
I did ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm getting and I‚Äôm already sick of her.  
---
I‚Äôd like to see where this is heading. 
---
I'm stealing 'Bing bong boi', that's fucking funny!!
---
Yeah I hate freddy
---
I'm also surprised! I've only matched her around 5-10 times in about 50 games as a solo survivor today.
---
I cant tell why people don't play her like crazy - like all the other killers upon release!
---
I see what you did there...
---
:'V
---
Image: a black screen
---
Noises: all the survivors falling and landing noises played, suggestively 
---
Honestly I love stupid humor like that 
---
The David running right past you towards the killer looks so fucking funny to me 
---
Well, I‚Äôm in NA and this evening it peaked at 28 minutes and killer is probably 40 minutes, so overloaded it refuses to display.
---
I personally rock the burial kimono as well, but my one issue with it is her katana is clipping through the damn thing on the main menu. It bugs me every time I see it.
---
If so then it's awful lol
---
Ps4
---
All my textures look horrible now. Do I need to reinstall it or something? It honestly looks like shit before the new dlc it looked less like shit and more like baby vomit
---
Unbreakable/No Mither + Tenacity is the ultimate anti-slug build.
---
That is ridiculous. I‚Äôm a survivor main and I can still acknowledge this is an insane bug that should be fixed asap lol
---
Yup it's garbage unless you are an actual god at the game.
---
Yeah I've never made it passed 8 as a survivor and that was like a year ago (Xbox). I usually hover around the 10-12 area. Currently 14 after the rank reset but I didn't play much the past month.
---
Weird ????
---
Sorry I only play on console but idk why it wouldn't exist on PC
---
Bruh is this real?
---
Check out the big brain on Brett! 
---
What are you playing on? PC? If so, desktop or laptop?
---
Sadly... killer wait time is unknown :(
---
Console or PC?!
---
PC:(
---
Weird af
---
Yeah the invisible thing is kinda shitty. Freddy makes sense canonically tho. 
---
Saaame
---
Oh looks like it works
---
Check to see if you need to restart your pc with an update. I had the same problem and just restarted my pc and it‚Äôs working now
---
Only time I‚Äôll accept noed as not a crutch is with bw 
---
*Visibly confused Father Dougal*
---
Finally someone says it
---
STRONGLY AGREE
---
ISSUE RESOLVED:  Game decided to make a new patch WHILE I was in a match.  Pretty good job so far.
---
I thought this was going to be a boneless pizza meme... 
---
Disconnect 
---
It's been a while since I played as or against Freddie but if nothing has changed your action speed is significantly decreased and he can see you when you're outside of his terror radius.
---
/u/Stunk_Beagle, don't you think it's interesting that the same players accusing *killers* of trying to get easy matches are using boost programs like Discord and Sony PartyChat‚Ñ¢ that give them easier matches?
---
Yea there‚Äôs nothing you can do about that. Rn the only counterplay to legion is to hope they‚Äôre dumb as a rock 
---
What are you playing on?
---
That's pretty hyperbolic. You were gifted the swivel hook, remember? 
---
The wait time always says 20, 30, or 40 minutes and I always get into a lobby in at least 2 minutes. 
---
I've been waiting too!!! I got one match with her at the temple but it immediately crashed when we loaded in so it doesn't count. I have yet to play a game with her on PS4.
---
Yep, I just closed the game out and restarted, now it‚Äôs saying 2 minutes!
---
Who/what is going on in the picture below?
---
I got it with one of my first matches with the plague, who I'm not sure knew how to play them because they only spit on people and never drowned any of us
---
You get a bigger brain, seems like a good deal to me.
---
Banned for what?
---
When you‚Äôre hid in a locker and another survivor opens it 
---
I prefer Legion over Nurse tbh, dont know why people shit on Legion and give Nurse a free pass.
---
It's not easy waking back up. Freddy is like road runner chasing after. He can see you through walls. He can lung attack you from 3 miles away. 
---
Been getting the same thing
---
Ehh it‚Äôs gotta be three toolboxes for me and I may consider it. I don‚Äôt mind med kits and definitely not flashlights. Flashlight just encourages them to waste time on saves they likely won‚Äôt get anyway 
---
Bubba approves.
---
R1 surv/killer here. My opinion is..
---
Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag, Plague, Huntress, Myers
---
Clown, Legion, Wraith,  LF, Doc, Pig, Trapper, Freddy
---
No rewards only punishment.
---
Witchhunting. 
---
This has also happened to me on PS4. I can't heal or be healed. It's happened three times so far.
---
Probably harassing people in their inboxes.
---
good plays
---
200 IQ play right there
---
That's been happening to me a lot actually where folks mostly just spit me and my teammates and rarely seem to down any of us 
---
Fuck that‚Äôs lame.
---
I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs completely true. Tru3 played him just fine on stream with out tunneling.  Is he the strongest? No, not by a long shot. But he isn‚Äôt completely shit. He can still slow the game down, his addons aren‚Äôt bad, and that‚Äôs not counting Franks. I don‚Äôt tunnel with him, and still have a good time. Actually got a message earlier from a player who said they had a really fun game, even though I was playing Legion. The killer isn‚Äôt bad, at least not to me, but the majority who play him may be a different story.
---
That patch was hours ago...
---
Space station asset from the new dlc leaked
---
You probably crouch camp around hooks . People wouldn't just accuse you of camping unless they have a reason
---
No, I just means his sacrifice is not for nothing. Lmao
---
Coming from a survivor main, you just sound like a survivor main lol if you were killer you wouldn‚Äôt feel the same way but I dooo feel like devs play favorites and put killers first but that definitely doesn‚Äôt show from taking away something like insta blind 
---
Ok
---
Yes this is EXACTLY how you beat her.  Just stay sick it doesn't do anything to you other than keep you injured and plow through gens.  I've been running Resilience since she came out.  I get so triggered watching my dumbass teamates feed her corrupt purge after corrupt purge.  I'm watching potatoes cleanse that aren't even broken...I'm staying sick repairing 3-5 gens myself while my teamates don't repair shit, feed her corrupt purge and take turns unhooking each other before repeating the cycle.
---
I believe that survivors that bleed out don‚Äôt count. I could be wrong but I believe they have to DC/get mori‚Äôd/die on hook for it to count. 
---
Then why buy and play their game then?
---
when the killer tries to tunnel the person you just saved but you have BT and they escape
---
lol so much spooning. you would think there are enough females for the guys to not act like theyre in an all-male prison
---
Snake beater
---
I don't mind dying so if someone is on the hook with NOED I will wait foe my opportunity to save with borrowed time while I sit on the hook
---
tragic
---
Did you 3D print that hatch? xD
---
I respect that. Whatever annoys you the most I guess
---
One of these times, you're gonna land on that pig head, and it'll bust open like a pinata filled with cottage cheese.
---
Isn't it great that there's a perk that promotes saying "fuck you" to altruism
---
I should be fine. As someone who mains Symmetra on Overwatch, I'm used to toxicity. Thanks for the insight, I'll probably pick this game up during the next Steam sale.
---
yea i totally understand. I had to stop playing as well. I just want to enjoy the new stuff so I am checkin to see if anyone has had luck. Im sure youre right though, needs to be fixed on their end, just sucks that we see it working fine for so many people
---
Tapp has the worst one.
---
I think they took a sound they already had and edited it, stretched it, and pitch shifted it. 
---
So on the note of this I know the perks got leaked and all but did the devs ever come out and say something or confirm it. Ik they‚Äôre real but I‚Äôm sitting in my kill your friends lobby on PS4 and have complete access to the perks and am a little confused
---
When half the meme is WHITE BOX
---
No they haven't though it's fairly obvious what the perks represent, practically confirming it. They're not able to come out and announce it because its not in their contract.
---
Oh okay. I thought they were file leaked but were they originally kill your friends leaked? Like is completely normal for me to have access to these perks?
---
Finally a balanced totem spawn
---
Shame its not an original artwork
---
You just traced another artist
---
Yup I got a perfect bbq read one time because their animation hadn't completely finished closing locker.  Funniest locker grab I've had.  Yes it was a Claudette.
---
a broken bone 
---
Still bothers me how overly lit these are
---
Lol nah it's perfectly useless as it is.  3 seconds is nothing.  Killer is on you again before you can get to a loop.  If they're running Enduring which is a staple on many killers they will literally be breathing down your neck before you hit the ground.  Practice objectivity.  
---
Anyone else dizzy after watching that?
---
This is actually good congrats even though they will probably never look at this its a really nice idea
---
Yea you and the other thousand people that did the same thing
---
It would be a lot better, but then people would just tell people one side is better to play than the other and then we'd be back at this spot again.
---
I don't care that it's a bug (a bad one at that), but I just love colored perks. Can't wait for Demise's perks :)
---
Given he directed and produced the Evil Dead series as well as acted in it (and is a voice actor himself) the odds are looking good!
---
Broken bone represents the Mangled and the tear drop represents Hemorrhaging.

---
Does anyone else‚Äôs queue time always say &lt; 1 minute remaining? Mine says that every time and always take upwards of 10-15 min to find a match. Granted, I‚Äôm doing SWF, but it‚Äôs never consistently taken this long before. 
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
‚ÄúFUCKING. HOLD. ON. I CAN ONLY FLOAT SO FAST!!‚Äù
---
It's far from auto aim. All it takes is a sedan to avoid being hit. I literally ran in circles trying to hit someone who was running and crouching around a car and I wasn't hitting them.
---
Lol playing the game with training wheels won't help when he has to face real survivors.
---
Then he'll wish he actually learned the game instead of relying on cheap perks to carry him.
---
Agreed I despise the crutch but I'd be satisfied with a totem counter.  At least at that point it's on us if we eat it.
---
I'm nervous that my GF will get jealous of Jane, because I am constantly distracted by her thiccness.
---
Jane is actually a buff for stealth killers. Myers gets 100% of his grab attempts on me if I am working with or play as Jane. 
---
I used to do them equally, I've been doing much more survivor now though. I think it is because dying as a survivor feels less bad than getting no kills as a killer. 
---
She has the weakest M1. You gotta learn how to time your dodges and 360s.
---
Not even special event cosmetics (for example, Pax West)? Where did they say this?
---
Maybe they should make the wait time to start a new lobby after backing out longer? Like that little penalty that doesn‚Äôt let you start again for a few seconds. 
---
Which sucks, true. But you're still better off without cleansing.
---
DBD was scary as shit when it first came out.  Now the only scares I get are laggy skill checks and the once in a blue moon Myers.
---
Very good idea(s)
---
I agree that it stunts growth for ones killer play  but I dislike you coming at a newer low rank killer that hard man.  You gotta start somewhere.  No need to be a dick about it.  This isn't a rank 1 Billy here.  
---
How come?
---
A fucking DBD Clippy: "Whoa! You're playing a lot of survivor recently! Did you mean to do that? We put you in the Killer queue to help you out!"
---
Quick question, forgive me if it's dumb, but is there a delay now so that the person being unhooked can't immediately be slugged again? I thought I remembered being downed as soon as I was off the hook before, and now I'm seeing this delay in games. Am I just misremembering or is it just a timing thing?
---
I think certainly people would play better overall for sure.
---
Vegan hatch?
---
It was from a Q&amp;A on Mathieu‚Äôs stream. He said they weren‚Äôt bringing back any unobtainable/exclusive cosmetics. If they did bring this idea it would be an occurring event once a year until it gets to the point where everyone has these cosmetics.
---
Games are instant for me now. Best its ever been
---
Yeah thats pretty accurate if you get zero kills its kind of your lack of skill or just bad RNG. As survivor its easier to say well my teammates or killer didnt give me a chance.
---
Update: after rebooting everything I was able to play. I don‚Äôt know what fixed it or what the problem was but it is working fine now. 
---
I agree, when you're a survivor, in the vainest sense you can always explain away your death to other people. If you do badly as a killer, you have nothing on your side. You can't even blame lag (until the dedicated servers come along).
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôd be ideal for a one time event. But it‚Äôs a shame. Everyone will have store cosmetics.
---

Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: in-game
---
Description: Borrowed time has yet to trigger for me, have used it many regardless of the killers distance, some occasions the killer was literally beside me as the unhook occurred and still no trigger.
---
It happened while I was in a match and I was unaware, checked the forums for anyone else who had the same problem, nothing, only realized when I looked through my YouTube recommended and saw TydeTyme talking about a new patch
---
Yeah, people need to play both sides otherwise their opinion isnt really valid on perk decisions or any changes to the game.
---
It‚Äôs always a David that comes back for you :‚Äô) 
---
I have a bad habit of running right into the killer. I deserve a good slugging and hook for it. 
---
Dammit.  I just seen this post and that was what I was gonna say.  Worst is when they put ruin and haunted together because then everyone is looking for it.  When I play killer I always put those 2 together lol
---
I always thought it was just her moving forward in a very "odd" way, like billy but distorting the world or herself, not really a void like Freddy.
---
Still, I imagine it would be funny to see Nurse trying to fight Freddy
---
Thanks, appreciate the compliment.
---
Even here, Freddy is the weakest
---
Me: I'm getting slugged a lot tonight, I think I'll put on Unbreakable.
---
\*puts on unbreakable\*
---
Me: \*never gets slugged again the entire night\*
---
"Damn Dwight, you look way older"
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem, just get the huntress to accidentally chop down the tree lmao
---
I 100% agree with all of this.
---
For me, a Legion lovah, I almost never use franks. If people DC against that, even I can say that, yeah, I 100% understand. 
---
It's those who DC on sight that I hate. Still, I want BHVR to fix my boy... S. And girls. 
---
And killers complain that people SWF lol. Maybe its because otherwise you end up playing with a bunch of morons who can't even touch a gen.
---
Oh wow! Is this really happening? I thought the other million post just like this we're just some really bad Photoshop. 
---
No worries with the new rank system them facecamping losers will be in the back with the 18-20 trash facecampers. I got a 3 k and facecamped with bubba to try it out and holy hell I didn‚Äôt even get close to even safety pipping when on the old system you would almost double pip. Had a legion dribble me to the hook earlier to, guess he didn‚Äôt get the memo! 
---
Where are you located O.o 
---
More like 2 mins
---
Thats it grandma, show me that ace in the hole' 
---
Yeah, she's a classic "tough kid" putting on a brave front.
---
holy shit
---
He did you a disservice, they have an arc to them. There‚Äôs this idea that ED 2 is a remake...it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a sequel, the first 10 or so minutes were to get folks up to speed since many hadn‚Äôt seen the first when the 2nd came out in theaters
---
i wonder if his pubic hair is the same
---
You also get severely punished for doing a last min rescue mission from a camping asshole, 2 team mates dead and the third on the hook with exit gate open and maybe 5 meters away, killer just far enough before third dies in struggle but still within heartbeat range and I go for the save and we both get out. Guess what -65 unsafe hook rescue and -15 for not unhooking the other 2 because the bitch camped them in the basement. No pip and just barely safety pipped. Fuck BhVR! I went above and beyond to save my teammate and I get the shaft!
---
Running NOED on Billy is pretty embarrassing 
---
Same here, wait times are almost instant.

That would be amazing! Agree agree agree.

Prepare for the ‚Äúbut it counters stuns that‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to do‚Äù dumbass reply. People who aren‚Äôt objective completely lose sight of the fact the perk was reworked to counter tunneling, it‚Äôs supposed to be for the health of the game. To have that completely nullified by a widely used, popular killer perk makes no sense at all. Hopefully this gets talked about enough that the devs realize how stupid that is.
---
I love this Dwight he is perfect. u/scarslookgood LOOK
---
I love it when teammates play this well.
---
Even as a killer i become a little bit proud at flawless executions amongst survivors like this.
---
I ain‚Äôt complainin. Pls devs don‚Äôt nerf
---
I still think every killer offering except maybe bloody party streamers should be secret. 
---
Idk if this is right, but if you're on console (which doesn't have Bill) then the perks from Bill are now regular survivor perks available from the default perk pool.
---
If they're sick they can just instaheal at a fountain. The only time you'll see an injured, uninfected survivor is during corruption, I think. With that said, they're not very useful in my opinion.
---
No i play pc
---
I noticed this today too when I was playing! Love the new small details 
---
He combines the most unfun aspects of this game: No counterplay and more hold button to do certain action simulator. Terrible design overall. 
---
I'd rather have rituals refunded if everyone else dc's within the first minute, and dcs count as moris when it's the last survivor, but when I'm just tryna get my couple rituals done for the day it actually turns me off the game entirely the way it is.
---
Me like
---
This is true
---
I saw a good idea also ages ago that these dailies automatically gift you 1 mori in-game. So you don't need an offering 
---
That was awesome! Well done!
---
Holy shit, you really need to stop whoring this "joke" out.
---
I run a similar build but switch out dead hard for BT in case the killer is a camper. Easy save with BT, next time they will tunnel you because they are pissed about the BT, then deliverance into decisive for easy escape. It's the most annoying build to play against
---
Am I the only one that actually loved this and thought it was an addition just for her to hear?
---
Cause a big chunk of Legion players don't play him right. Rather using frenzy on someone then going after any nearby survivors to slow the game down, they like to tunnel a single survivor with frenzy just to get a quick down which in itself is a very toxic and dumb way to play, might as well just slug em twice and call it a day. Then to top that off u can't get distance between u using vaults or pallettes cause Legion can just vault with u. He's super fast and it's just all around a dumb design. Don't get me wrong I love the look of legion and I'm not saying that ALL ppl play legion this way. But his power is just too annoying to go against and it's a loophole for tunneling in my opinion. 
---
This x1000
---
**PIANO INTENSIFIES**
---
Am I stupid, or is this actually true? 
---
Love the buried face at the bottom
---
i'm honestly not sure, all i know is that the extra time you shed after the hit with stbfl + the hindrance from the gas can help you end chases insanely quickly, it's very good. if it did do that, then it's just an added bonus :D
---
i don't think tattoo's is that bad, but there are simply better, more effective things you can use in that spot.
---
Thanks! I think I'm pretty decent at countering or reading survivors but my decision making can be pretty scary xD your feedback really helps
---
I get that and I upvoyed you for it, but how will losing the loud ass glass shattering sound going to impact that?
---
Apparently you can hear the booty claps

It would be cool if instead of nea gasping or yelling, she would do some sort of cocky laugh, since jumping from high places is kinda her thing
---
Jane uses Dwight's Personal Locker, making him shout at her. She calmly explains to him the situation, and they both proceed to beat Bill Virgin Ass
---
the color of the perk
---
And had you not camped and killed no one the same survivors would have messaged you and said things like you're trash and gg ez and baby killer and well the list goes on.
---
Damned if you do damned if you don't. Just play your way do your thing get your fun out of it and move on. And depending on your platform maybe change it so strangers can't message you.
---
Extra bonus points to the person you hook being on the final hook to die.  Lets you not even have to worry about "protecting" them.
---
i‚Äôve never had to wait longer than a minute since the new update, weird. 
---
I had it tell me the wait time was unknown tonight... I was just excited to see something other then &lt;1
---
Gr8 b8 m8
---
It's not the new lobby system. Every single time a new killer is added killer queue times get longer. Everyone wants to play the new killer. Playing the new survivor isnt as cool because all survivors are the same mechanically.
---
*grabs shoulders of hooked survivors*
---
 "Now before I unhook you. You should know that I am a man of many skills. One of which is We'll Make It III. You have two options. One of which is too stay still and get healed. If you do that will be the end of it. Or run away...but if you do I want you to know one thing...I will chase you...I will find you...and I WILL heal you.
---
*baby meg with Sprint burst about to be unhooked*
---
"Good luck."
---
Wait, you can join a lobby? HOW!?
---
As u/eladmada said theyre generally better perks. The other thing is blood point cost. If you solely wanted to farm bloodwebs browns/yellows to go. Greens are 5k bp and purples are 6k bp
---
It shows &lt;1 which is ‚Äúgreater than 1 minute‚Äù so it could be anything lol
---
Pretty good job so far hahahahaha
---
I'm not bothered enough to turn my messages off,  I've met more friends than toxic people. Tbh. Lol. I just think it's funny that it is hilarious to him to be toxic and taunt me,  because I'm not good. But when my "trash" killer ass downs hooks and kills him,  I'm toxic lol. I've actually had someone call me a baby LOL. I laughed so hard,  but I only need to surprise attack people with the Wraith. I did it,  then just kicked gens,  chased but didn't hit or swing at anyone. Borderline farming,  and they still did that. I was like ok that's cool.
---
Teach me your ways
---
Don't you mean from the *Dumb ol' d-d-Texas* Chainsaw Massacre?
---
Freddy also has an ultra rare (pink) add-on called Black Box which causes there to be an obsession, and that survivor starts the match in the Dream World.  
---
Meyers has a rare (green) add-on called Judith's Journal that causes there to be an obsession, and "considerably" increases his Evil Within gains when stalking that survivor.  
---
These are currently the only killer add-ons that trigger obsession, whether there are obsession perks in the game or not.
---
I've done similar, played matches just goofing doing memes and so on. My favorite is playing the game normally except when I down someone I juggle them on the spot let them go and go after someone else. I'd say 2 of 3 times I do this I get messages with trash talking about how EZ I was and so on.
---
People are funny.
---
https://youtu.be/_MvbUqOVJic
---
Btw I'm not taking what he said to heart,  I'm just starting to see the killers point of view more and more every match I play. 
---
NOED says hi.
---
Just play nice, accept that losing will happen in video games, and literally ignore everyone and just say gg and leave endgame chat instantly. That is how I have enjoyed every minute of this game. 
---
There's too many pathetic people in the world that want to cause pain in others' lives to help cope with their own shit lives. Best just to ignore them, than to let them win.
---
what about waves
---
I could imagine they might be buddies and the one became bait while they healed up to pull this off?
---
I mean as a killer it doesnt hurt to at least give a small chase to wound at least? And if the player kept to the area and the killer saw the crawler and no players then wouldnt be forced to stop chasing?
---
Idk.
---
Yes! One day I full on tired to farm,  again as huntress just so they'd let me get my hatchet throws. They would NOT farm,  just kept running from. So I ended up just killing me,  they were new like I was,  but from playing surviors I could predict where they'd run. They called me a baby killer,  and said I got lucky because how they wiggled free and made me chase them. 
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of bug: Post game emblem screen
---
I earned 100% lighbringer emblem and only recieved a gold emblem for it.  94% generator repairs 6% exit gate opening.  
---
Literally just cost and rarity in bloodwebs. The usefulness of perks is very unrelated to the rarity tag.
---
He has the same lunge as other killers but since they all have a weapon that extends from their body. Freddy‚Äôs claws go this far but they don‚Äôt look like they should. 
---
Wheeze wheeze - wheeze wheeze - wheeze wheeze - wheeze 
---
that is just plain poor design
---
Thanks It‚Äôs our specialty
---
They added i-frames when you're being unhooked to where you don't actually take the damage until you have control over your character. This prevents you from being smacked while unhooked and instantly downed, which leads to quite a few mistimed swings resulting in wasted swings that would've injured or otherwise downed the rescuer/rescued.
---
Yeah but it's not me making the game too short, the survivors work on the gens too fast. I'm AFKing so my rank goes from 13 to 15, out of desperation to get the trophy. I just hope 15 gives easy +2 pips. But I wouldn't mind knowing when the next rank reset is. Thanks
---
Doesn't matter, survivors will still complain for "not playing fair", regardless of the circumstances.
---
Ye I find it a bit weird, when I have to wait 4 minutes to get in a lobby
---
Their opinions do outweigh those who do not play both sides.  
---
You can‚Äôt have a firm grasp and decide what‚Äôs nerf or buff worthy in a game you only play half of... vs those who play the entire game and have an opinion...
---
yeh byoi!!!!
---
F*CK YOU BHVR FOR NOT EVEN TESTING YOUR OWN GAME. THIS NEW RANKING SYSTEM IS A SHIT SHOW. IT BREEDS BAD KILLER TOXIC BEHAVIOR AND A COOP SURVIVOR GAMES THAT MADE IT COMPETITIVE TO EACH OTHER. AS A FORMER GAME DESIGNER. YOUR RANKING SYSTEM IS PUNISHING YOUR PLAYER BASE. PUNISHING YOUR PLAYERS ARE A BIG NO NO AND NUMBER ONE RULE FOR DESIGN. TEST AND PLAY YOUR GOD DAMN OWN GAME BEFORE YOU EVEN GOD DAMN RELEASE IT LIVE. YOU HAVE YOUR GOD DAMN OWN Q&amp;A TEAM TO TEST SHIT LIKE THIS. YOU GUYS RELEASE SO MANY GOD DAMN SKINS AND IM SURE YOU CAN AFFORD Q&amp;A TEAM TO TEST BIG CHANGES LIKE REVAMPING OF RANKING. 
---
SOLUTION: LOWER THE DE-PIP THRESHOLD ON GREEN, PURPLE AND RED RANKS. I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT HARDER TO PIP AND YOU WANT IT NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO PIP ON RED RANKS. BUT GOD DAMN. IT'S SO MUCH EASY TO DE-PIP. ONLINE ONLY GAMES REQUIRE ANY SENSE OF PROGRESSION. DBD IS THE BLOODWEB AND RANK. PUNISHING EVERYONE ON RANKING IN ALL LEVEL IS JUST ASKING MAJORITY YOUR PLAYER BASE TO LOSE INTEREST. IF THIS KEEP GOING FOR FEW MORE DAYS. THIS GAME IS GOING TO BLEED PLAYER BASE FASTER THAN YOU CAN RELEASE SKINS. 
---
You're honestly doing yourself a disservice if you only play one side. I play survivor and killer. When I play survivor I remember what moves and tactics I use when I play killer, and approach the situation from there. When I play killer I remember the tactics I use as a survivor and approach the situation from there. 
---
If you can get in the head of both the roles then odds are you'll succeed more likely in almost any situation you find yourself in. Whether it's the shoes of a survivor, or in the body of a blood drenched killer.
---
Same here
---
Lighting too bright or are you using slang from kids these days?
---
Thank you! I knew something was a little different or delayed. 
---
I just laugh honestly,  I don't even get mad. It just amazes me how people think they can act,  and not get someone reacting back towards them. 
---
That R5-6 was on survivor, i'm at R5 on killer atm, PC. I took a lil' break before the DLC. I'd say i'm on an equal level with those two, granted i don't have the streamer privilege of getting sniped by good survivors :) I have bad blink days though so i'm sort of inconsistent but i mostly 4k (usually 3k if hatch has spawned cause i can't be arsed to slug) with 1 or 2 gens done without tunneling/camping/slugging.
---
You good? &lt;1 means less than a minute...
---
I literally thought dude was playing until he got me with that one shot. Almost didn't get away, but for a friend that sacraficed herself by saving me
---
Yeah it‚Äôs happened to me as killer a few times
---
You‚Äôve somehow spelt ‚Äúsurvivors,‚Äù wrong 6 times in one post. 
---
Killing all 4 survivors with gens left and ruin still up
---
I have not, but there's an idea! 
---
I mean, the second doc had plenty of time to look away...
---
Ps4 North America. I get stuck with a 'wiggle' prompt that won't allow me to run as intended because every other step the game thinks I am supposed to be wiggling. I have noticed it 3 times against the newest killer just not sure if it has to do with her directly or not. Great game either way. 
---
Many, many thanks to not only the devs but the loved ones you may not be seeing as much as you like.
---
I never leave a man/woman behind! Borrowed Time is my boo.
---
Freddy, Laurie, Tapp, Amanda and Quentin also talk in their movies. They don't in DBD
---
Jesus I would be pissed
---
Trapper boi done goofed up
---
I myself would just rather run ruin for the stronger early game rather than a consistent midgame, if anything. Though you could run both for the gen hate.
---
how do I stop someone on reddit
---
Yes, so? The technique of blocking the break still worked. Claudette just needed to be better with the flashlight. 
---
One thing that often bothers me about Legions is when he slashes you, breaks the chase so you're forced to start mending, then just slashes you when you're mending. Also you have the choice of wasting time getting everyone healed up only for Frenzy to undo it all in a few seconds, or just having everyone be a one-hit kill.
---
Good looks, I'm gonna try this one out right now, thank you
---
I love his lil baby hands 
---
I only play killers and I'm never mean to survivors.  I love em all, man, even the clickety-clackety flashlight and teabaggity ones.
---
Everybody gets a GG from me.
---
I think if pipping was too easy, then your opponents were too easy. I've been a rank 1 Nurse for months, but every few games I'll hit some really stealthy and cooperative survs who just roll me. This means I depip NOT because the system is more difficult, but because my opponents were, i.e.a self regulating and organic difficulty level
---
I don't want to sound like a dick but rank reset isn't a good idea. then you'd be taking the top tier players and sending them against the newest players. I think it should be a once per season deal
---
&gt; beat up potato
---
&gt; he tries to free himself and robs you of a hook
---
I'm not sure that'll even work. 
---
The only way to counter is to hope its rank 20 legion who dumb and has IQ of 20. Or the good ol dc.
---
Happened to me on Xbox
---
Rank reset is the 13th of every month 
---
Jesus I had to read this multiple times to get it. But overall I love the idea. The idea of a Killer scream signaling their power is really badass. And this rework actually extends the Legion's power by alot, and allows counterplay at the same time to those who are careful. 
---
*This is what The Legion should've been. *
---
Just provin my point, my dude. Walk on now.
---
Yea forgot to mention it  in post looking for clothes for frank
---
In my experience when playing as a killer, I always get four survivors instantly when the que time is over. So I think it have something to do with the game searching for survivors during that que time, though a few suvivors leaves the lobby anyway, which just makes the wait longer
---
Just let me enjoy this game ok xd
---
yea i am looking for frank but its hard to find any with hood
---
Exposed doesn't affect any killer powers, only the basic attack works (except billy and bubba's chainsaws with speed limiter, those do work with exposed)
---
Type of Bug: In-game
---
Description: Level 2 Decisive Strike occurring 3 minutes after unhook despite description of only available for 50 seconds. Potentially due to flashlight save.

---
Sincerely,the french fag
---
You lose alot of progress for staying near hooks i‚Äôve heard, maybe that? 
---
I have as well, and it‚Äôs getting incredibly annoying.  Honestly they really need to rework the Daily Rituals.  There should be a hell of a lot more variety.  Seriously, BHVR, throw a little money my way and I will sit my ass down and come up with tons of rituals you can put into the game.  Since you‚Äôre not doing it.  üòè
---
It‚Äôs even a flair ;)
---
Aight
---
Yo, can you send us a link to all of your perk/item icons. 
---
They look really cool and I want them.
---
Bloodlust is a thing. 
---
Nah, i'm with him on this one. I think its a dick move to take the locker guy too. that being said I wouldn't be telling people they can't do that, people can play how they want. 
---
Is this a joke? You can‚Äôt possibly be serious. Adrenaline is the most whined about survivor perk after DS, killers constantly complian about multiple Adrenalines in a game, get outta here with this shit. You must live in a cave when it comes to this game.
---
Ok, well when Adrenaline is nerfed, I‚Äôll be sure to remember you. We shall see.
---
The closest thing I could think of is to not heal and to split up. But that‚Äôs not easy to communicate with randoms 
---
no
---
I think i had 2 golds and 2 silver or something like that . My problem is that this now you are ranked by your ability to do certain objectives not my your ability to kill people ( the main objective) . I got 11 hooks , no camp, and the last guy escaped by hatch ( another game mechanic on which we could have an entire new argument ) . Anyway , thanks for your reply . I m extremly angry at this game that i m adictted to . 
---
    Sorry for my bad english .
---
Reminds me of when fortnite accidentally added boob jiggle physics and everyone went ham 
---
I actually got super lucky in my first match as a Killer after the patch. My hex totem spawned spawned next to a wall with a stack of crates and a burning barrel blocking the front of it. I walked right up to it and could barely tell it was there. Went the whole match without it being found. I can‚Äôt remember the last time that happened. 
---
That honestly would scare the shit out of me.  
---
New update made pipping way harder, honestly dont care about pipping rank doesnt get you anything, right now it doesnt even effect what rank ur opponents will be
---
So basically, since it‚Äôs thicc Jane she makes all the male survivors ‚Äòdead hard‚Äô 
---
Is this the new daily thread? still its better than "wAs I cAmPiNG ????"
---
Indeed. Feral Frenzy I felt sounded animalistic, so I went with power meter filling of because of blood scent. That fit. Then the primal scream idea to signal the beginning and end of Legion's power naturally evolved with that. All of which fits with Legion's theme.
---
To be honest it makes me more annoyed playing survivor when the killer plays like a scumbag cause I know you dont need to do that in most scenarios. Similarly playing survivor makes me hate immersed people when playing killer
---
Close Dead by Daylight     
---
Open Steam     
---
Right-click "Dead by Daylight"      
---
Select Properties     
---
Go under the "LOCAL FILES" tab and select "VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES..."      
---
Allow that to finish and reopen Dead by Daylight
---
If that still doesn't resolve it. Do exactly as above but instead select "UNINSTALL GAME..." and then let that finish before re-installing it.
---
If that doesn't resolve it, then you're banned I guess.
---
In a swf maybe? But again quite risky especially on some maps without many pallets, plague is 115 speed.
---
In solo or anything but a 4man swf no, other survivors will cleanse and you are one shot not only from her m1 but also the corrupt spit
---
I will never understand the ‚Äújust do totems‚Äù counterargument. How will I know If they‚Äôre all gone? What if I miss one? Spend the entire game cleansing totems JUST in case they have a perk which there is a decent chance they don‚Äôt have?
---
It‚Äôs because you were obviously camping, the new ranking system doe not affect rank 15‚Äôs. So yea stop camping 
---
There is no such thing as a weak m1 wt are you on about?
---
I have gotten different ones. But, every re-roll I have done since 2.6 has given me the exact same ritual.
---
\&gt;doctor that high      
---
\&gt;leatherface that low    
---
opinion discarded
---
You dont unless the legion is dumb, easy free win if the legion uses the perk
---
Is it really that bad? I only played this game because I'd just unlocked Agitation for my Wraith. I'll be using the same build on him. But probably swap NOED with Territorial
---
I think it's sort of true, but I think this game inherently rewards toxicity. Especially with how bp and shards are awarded. It sets up all sorts of ways for people to dominate each other, especially if you are a killer, and that brings out the worst of gamers. Gamers already have a lack of empathy, playing both sides isn't going to fix that when it's not something unique to this game.
---
I m a hillbilly with add ons that let me get from a corner of the map to another . I have no reason to camp and i did not
---
May I inquire the context of the disagreement? 
---
I voted Huntress btw
---
Maybe the first 4 gens got done very quickly?
---
Well i pretty much let them do to do them because i had 3 gens in a straight line so i was going to 3 gen them . That s probably it but i m angry beacause this game is no more about killing people , it s now about breaking gens and other things
---
Why does it have only 18 upvotes?  I laughed at this one pretty hard :D
---
Well I did upload it pretty early today. I live in Australia so a lot of people won't be on until much, much later for me.
---
Theres nothing wrong with playing around the basement and survivors should be smarter than to be anywhere near it against some killers but seriously most games where games revolve around the basment are just 4ks and basement builds are obnoxious on some killers. Its either rush gens or trade places till everyones dead
---
So many trappers/hags etc just sit 10 feet away from the basement after putting every single trap there.
---
What the heck did I just watch 
---
NOED is bullshit honestly. With all the changes to survivors it shouldnt be in the game anymore
---
Of course the nurse is stronger than the Legion. However, nurse is more fun and rewarding to juke and survive against, the survivors are forced to change their gameplay and are always on the edge of their seat, but against the legion the chases are just long and boring and have no room for mindgames
---
Awh what?? I was looking forward to giving the Adept Plague a go but now I ain‚Äôt bothering if it‚Äôs gonna be that stressful. 
---
Also while I‚Äôm here, when you attempt an adept acheivement are add-ons and offerings allowed or nay?
---
/u/BillMurrie  Why do you delete comments?
---
Go make some calming tea while you being hooked. 
---
Remember me
---
Non try hards = baby survivors?
---
Thank you! :)
---
That's just a shorter way of saying 40 min.
---
Are you really not going to admit that you're getting easier matches with SWF + voice apps? Long post just to avoid the point. 
---
TL;DR - "I'm mad that I can't bully Killers anymore".
---
BNP was OP, as it let you fix an entire gen in about 20 seconds.
---
DS was cancer that boosted bad Survivors.
---
Pallet vaccums turned half of each map into safe zones and made each chase take about 6 hours.
---
Insta-blind flashlights took away any kind of skill involved in their use and allowed you to blind Killers MID-CHASE.
---
If you're angry that all these bullshit things are gone, you were too reliant upon them to make up for your lack of skill (as evidenced by your admission that you can now only enjoy 4-person SWF) and need to git gud.
---
now that's a game that have worthy cosmetics
---
Well, I was bit exaggerating, but the problem is that tunneling players as legion is much better than not tunneling players as legion and as somebody said, "If you give players a fast but extremely boring way of doing a task, they will take that way."
---
Once all fountains are corrupted they all reset, so that won't work
---
Yeah most likely. People cant go file digging on console do usually they're fine
---
1) Enemy stand user approaches
---
2) Epic posing
---
3) Enemy becoming a bro after the battle
---
4) Even when he is old, Mista still can't overcome his fear of the fourth panel
---
I got it, it's a jojo reference 
---
Huntress has the best slasher material in my opinion. 
---
Wow new Level of ‚ÄúMy uncle work at Nintendo‚Äú üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Hot damn this is cool

Is this loSS?
---
It's the Tots Elrod rehauled by an artist.
---
Different painting and hair.
---
The mask ist very large. 
---
They don‚Äôt get the stack if they‚Äôre within 16 meters 
---
Only 16 because I guess that‚Äôs what distance the devs view as camping. 
---
Accidentally?
---
The issue of the muting aspect is that it only works 40% of the time making it unreliable. It also doesn't stop the gen regression caused by blowing the gen up making it worthless. 
---
Most the time you wouldn't want to blow the gen up unless you're up against a Freddy were you have to do it. Even in that situation its still a 40% chance you dont reveal your location to him. 
---
The repair sound reduction isnt very good. Killers will still kick gens that sound like they have progressed meaning whether you repair the gen or not the killer will likely still investigate it. 
---
The perk overall seems to work best for new players who have a harder time hitting skill checks. After exiting the new player lobbies the perk becomes pointless.
---
&gt;since Resilience lets you vault 9% faster too
---
This is unfortunately not any longer the case. With the update that changed post-window vault momentum, this feature has also been removed from Resilience, as well as Spine Chill and Leader (and Prove Thyself, obviously).
---
I don't think Resilience is worth a perk slot anymore, but in your build it at least combines with Botany Knowledge to increase Self-Care's healing speed by 42%, which should almost put you back at 100%, or 16 seconds - "should" because various things in DbD experience deminishing returns when stacked, and healing speed could very well be one of them (it certainly seemed that way to me, anyway, whenever I stacked a Med-Kit with Abdominal Dressings, Surgical Suture, Botany Knowledge, Resilience and Spine Chill).
---
The entire point of the change is to discourage unfun gameplay. You camp? A few of your emblems suffer. You HARD tunnel someone? You're that much more likely to get a 4k where the last person dies on their first hook.
---
First thought: Because its swf?  
---
If not:   
---
I dunno.. only halfway logical reason could be you being a better surv (maybe measured due to the average of your past season ranks?) than the 5/6 ranked survs. Or it could be the other way around - the 5/6 ranked survs are playing just as good as you but only got to that high rank due to swf..   
---
But nevertheless.. Imo this system needs important additions like some rewards for climbing, adjustments/fixes to the emblem categories (like I mentioned some issues in my previous posts), and finally a better season cycle aswell. One month is a joke.  
---
No he won.
---
Mostly because you can't just punish the killer for not immediately sprinting to the opposite side of the map and waiting there until they're unhooked. A 16m radius is a pretty significant chunk of the map.
---
I don‚Äôt think so at all. 
---
16 meters isn‚Äôt that big on many of the maps. 
---
did a match against Hag in swamp yesterday. that was a joke. The chase music was spawning at bs moments with volume at 300%.
---
Nice meme but also fuck you
---
When the totem isn't in the middle of an open field with a beacon shining down on it, the late game is spicy. Tired of needing Thrill of the Hunt just to protect my hex T:&lt;
---
that is so true
---
Some survivors are idiots yeah
---
So true
---
It's probably more because it is literally impossible to double pip without the 4k now. Some killers are thirsty for the rank ups.
---
I don't know what's going on
---
Punish camping? Cool. Punish tunneling? Cool. Punish killers who can destroy the entire team in seconds because they are good at the game? Hell nah
---
Bill has a special place in my heart too. 
---
I play Killer mainly, and hearing that overpowering "COUGH-WHEEEEEZE" of an injured Bill just screams "I'm here, hook me, ya hippie"
---
Unless you play on console, which is notoriously nurse-free. I have 800 hours and have only ever seen one really good nurse, and I made it out by the skin of my ass
---
AHAHAHA NOW YOU CAN NEVER CLEANSE MY HAUNTED GROU- wait
---
A common kind of meme build for repairing gens as fast as possible goes as follows;
---
Perks:
---
No Mither - You start the match injured but make less sound and don't leave pools of blood. You can also pick your self up from the dying state with no limit. Need this unless you plan to get injured and then not heal.
---
This cant be happening - Great Skill checks are 30% bigger while injured. Great against ruin or to speed gen progression along
---
Resilence - Your action speed increased by 9%
---
Dead Hard - Allows you to dash forward and not take damage. Pretty much mandatory to not die with no mither.
---
Item;
---
Commodius tool-box with socket swivel and instructions. Could also use Wire spool and instructions. 
---
This build will allow you to power through gens but leaves you exposed. 
---
Poised has also become a good gen-jocky build by allowing you to run away from a gen with no scratch marks. 
---
Prove Thyself is great for making working with someone else on a gen alittle faster.
---
Stake out can be a good way to get 4 easy greats if you just walk around or work on a gen near the killer. Working on a gen or being near a killer while they are chasing someone else is a good way to earn tokens.
---
Detective Hunch highlights anything interesting nearby. Can be good for getting points by breaking dull totems or finding next gen.
---
Adrenaline great for healing after completing all gens. More or less rewards you for completing all gens.
---
If you want to avoid getting chased while working on a gen then spine chill is your answer.
---
Yeah I have a rule now, if two people DC (Ragequit or otherwise) one goes free. I'll hunt down and play for real until there's only one left and they get the hatch. Not gonna screw \*everyone\* over for trash players/trash matchmaking
---
Imagine patrolling the Game map, when you suddenly hear the "WOOOWOW-whew" in the other room.
---
P.S.: I'm not sure that the Killers hear these new sounds, but that would be great.
---
True
---
IIRC Rotten Fields is the largest map, and the wiki says it's 11,265m^2. A 16m radius around a hook has an area of 804.25m^2.
---
Even on a large, single storey map &gt;7% of the map drains your points for being in it. That's a pretty large amount considering:
---
* Multiple survivors can be on multiple hooks, increasing that area of punishment for being efficient.
---
* Some maps like the game are tiny compared to Rotten Fields and they've already struggled with using verticle distance in mechanics.
---
* Some maps are weird shapes, are you saying a killer needs to be punished for going from one side of Azarov's to the other because they downed a survivor in the middle stretch?
---
I'd say it's a pretty fair value which may not be perfect in all cases, but does avoid overpunishing people who don't camp. Hell, you can make it as big as you like, that isn't going to stop a Billy from sitting at max range with a chainsaw, a Huntress with a hatchet, a Nurse with a blink wound up, etc.
---
With a lot of elbow grease.. perhaps it could be..
---
I don't think I've ever seen someone use the phrase "literally unplayable" unironically
---
Finally, some good fucking PEBBLE. 
---
A lot of close minded people, it‚Äôs a great game but with a lot of issues and people are too toxic and feel they need to be rude for some odd reason instead of just discussing the issues 
---
The "whats wrong with legion" is fighting with the "fuck noed" for the daily thread spot
---
BTW I used microsoft word for this
---
You do have a fair point, but what I mean by that though is that there are no rules dictating how the killer achieves his goal, so in that regard there‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù way to play bring it toxic or not. 
---
Wow, a Killer that announces their power so the survivors can hide.
---
That sounds really useful... NOT!
---
And Im still not even able to see stretch marks.
---
I like Legion how they are, Thanks.
---
I got similiar experiences like you in the past.. it's kinda annoying although I do like the higher effort you have to give in order to climb.  
---
Imo this system needs important additions like some rewards for  climbing, adjustments/fixes to the emblem categories (like I mentioned  some issues in my previous posts), a much better report system and finally a better season cycle  aswell. One month is a joke.   
---
Maybe that will prevent some DC's..  
---
If you're on console it's just a regular survivor perk cause we don't have Bill
---
I actually used a stop watch since the release of the plague and even when I'm playing with friends I get into a lobby within 45-55 seconds.
---
Happy cake day
---
This is so damn good.
---
no. It's one of the most meme perk.
---
One part is based on luck. You don't spend your time missing your skillcheck and if it happens once or twice you can't be sure the perk will activates himself.
---
And for the repair audio radius it's extremely specific.
---
I don't see which perk is worst than Technician. Even Boil over can be more useful. 
---
Well fuck, when did this change happen?
---
Some Survivors are so self entitled to win that it just becomes cringey tbh 
---
A good escape chase build for survivor is : 
---
&gt; Quick &amp; Quiet / Dance with me / Lithe / Distorsion
---
yea no. If you want to farm you at least pick Borrowed time. I mean you know‚Ä¶ that's still your teamates.
---
Well, guess i'll have to kill myself
---
You'd better listen to him. Enjoy offline, kiddo.
---
Source: My dad is a Nintendo.
---
Using diversion is way too fun. It's become one of my main perks and I never take it offf
---
Most tall killers have their FOV in their neck, that's why before an update recently you needed to aim at their neck instead of their eyes. For balance reasons i guess, imagine being able to see above most loops and the corn.
---
I hate it when survivors call me out for camping a hook after they body block for each other the entire game, tbh they should remove weapon cool down it is the stupidest thing in this game 
---
I had a similar issue on PS4. I spawned with the wiggling promt and got stuck on the floor every few steps. The bar wouldn't fill up and it   still showed up after being carried to a hook.
---
Exactly my same rule. I got in a game yesterday where as soon as I downed the first guy, him and his friend just dced. I then let the other 2 guys do 2 full gens, destroy my totems and then let them both escape. No need to be cruel about it.
---
Hail to the King baby
---
Well, long as people like you keep making threads, and the Steam forum keeps it up, BHVR will at least have to explain what they think they're doing.
---
 Here's to hoping you get better matches from here on!
---
My cousin changed Adam to a random stock picture of a smiling black guy, changed Dwight to a locker, made Claudette invisible, and changed Nea to a toxic waste barrel
---
Thanks man.
---
I disagree, Plague seems rather boring for both sides imo.
---
Having devour hope and huntress lullaby at 5 stacks
---
P is for priceless, the look upon your faces
---
i think its mostly survivor that people are pissed off about. it was hard to double pip as a survivor before, but now its nigh on impossible
---
My only comment is that you kept that question dangerously vague.
---
It was just that I said Huntress was a more balanced killer compared to hillbilly and he said vice versa. But I think we both had different definition of the word "balance". I was very objective why he was a bit subjective.
---
I wish this was fake but it‚Äôs unfortunately real
---
No wonder BHVR let you guys get a sneak peek of Flip Flop.
---
I know. But when I have a near perfect game where I do everything the emblem system wants me to do and still am nowhere close to the 2nd pip thats an issue
---
Well usually the response back is what feeds them. They're like trolls in a way.
---
P3 legion smh

i don't even mind the ranking system changes, i just want the game to work properly and not put me in high ping lobbies or have the killer DC a few minutes into the game EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT HIS FAULT THE GAME IS JUST BROKEN

JUST A LITTLE BIT

I've seen streamers and youtubers test them and they seem to work as described 
---
I just woke up 
---
Im gona eat more sleeping meds

Michael Kyers would make the best movie potential. Same goes for Leatherface and Pig.
---
I seem to get unhooks with meg or wraith hits.
---
Killers too, but yeah i see that
---
Not to my knowledge. I think the release date is still just "summer"
---
Mhm, 'fraid so. The developers themselves confirmed it on the dev stream, after that patch. It was not intentional, apparently, and they did say they are considering making Resilience (and Spine Chill) affect window vault speeds again, but so far, no news on that, and yes, since Resilience still mentions vaulting, it has to currently be considered a bug. I do hope that they will make it apply to window vaults again (and ideally even pallet vaults/drops, for that matter), but I'm not optimistic that they will. They'll probably just remove the "vaulting" part from Resilience and be done with it.
---
9% faster action speed on a gen repair is ~6.6 seconds, and 1.15s on a totem cleanse (1.65s on opening exit gates). These are not very significant numbers, to say the least, and so without Resilience actually doing something as impactful as speeding up vaults, I don't see much of any justification for spending a slot on it.
---
(If these numbers seem unintuitive, it's because action speed does not simply reduce the time it takes to complete an action by the given %, but increases the speed at which you perform the action by said %, for which the equation is [base action duration] / [base action speed] + [action speed modifier] - for example: 80 seconds [base generator repair duration] / 1 [100% base generator repair speed] + 0.09 [9% increased action speed from Resilience] = 73.39s; this is actually also why Botany + Resilience's 42% doesn't "almost halve" the healing time when using Self-Care, regardless of potential diminishing effects, but only increases its 50% healing speed by 42%, which, 42% of 50% is 21%, which in turn means you heal at 71% of the base healing speed (16 / 1 - 0.71 = 22.53s; alternatively, 32 / 1 + 0.42 = 22.53s)).
---
Sorry for the math lection... bottom line: Resilience is really not worth a perk slot.
---
Tis not loss
---
I been Bing Bonging lately. He's not that bad now that I'm not absolutely garbage at the game
---
People suggested to give Lightweight a bonus like "survivors footsteps are quieter" combined with a slight buff to its current effect, either by making scratch marks fade slightly faster or by spreading the scratch marks as a polar opposite to Predator. Nothing too crazy, but also making it more viable for stealth gameplay.
---
That post has been showed by Matthew cote during a live hahajajaha
---
I would too, but he just looks like another killer then hahah
---
Tbh when you go in red ranks as killer game tactics are binary.
---
Ignore the Ochido wannabe who's trying to get you to chase him he will not do gens anyway he's as good as dead.
---
When facing genrush survivors, when you get your first hook 2 to 3 generators have usually been done and there are two of them working on gens and one waiting for rescue. Only way to not lose is fake leaving to tunnel the guy and maybe down the second one rendering the game to a 2 survivors vs you, they can't keep doing gens.
---
If you did just go for a survivor on generator he would loop you for a bit, the other one would finish his gen and the 3rd one would rescue and heal his friend and go back on gen. This is a 1 survivor on hook 2 survivors on gens and one survivor rescuing / looping you deadlock. Trust me you will not have time to repeat this deadlock 12 times for every survivor. Only way to break it is what i stated above or use a green mori.
---
If two survivors are outside your BBQ chilli range that means it's worth it to soft camp since they are just waiting to rescue and doing nothing.
---
I justified killer tactics deemed as "cancer" so u can not read and downvote me but this is just the hard truth of how you win against good survivors.
---
As someone stated in another comment, tunnelling is merely the killer counterpart to genrush, it should just be called killrush.
---
Lol yeah its gonna piss of a lot of killers using dead hard and mettle of man lol could you imagine if DS was still how it used to be as well? You effectively take 4 hits, then use DS lol THEN 5TH GEN POPS AND  YOUR ADRENALINE GOES OF AND YOU ARE OUTTA THERE lol
---
Oh shit true smth to that effect couldve been the case. But i mean i went from rank like 14 or 13 down to 17 (maybe even 18 i forgot) after the derank so like why am i getting put in such a weird rank spot? Idk its still funny
---
"Estimated wait time: 43 minutes"

Also, did he say that he got it from his nephew? lmao

Oh boy try to stay injured with that stupid injured music for more than a minute and you‚Äôll become deaf

I find that killers in higher ranks love to do this. Huntress, Hillbilly, and Nurse are the biggest offenders. Slugging is personally really aggravating and unfun for me, so I make sure to try and run UB when solo. It isn't useful in every match, but at least it makes me feel better when it does get some use. Kind of like an anger fail-safe.

Are you playing legion /s
---
What is it?
---
Central NA. :/
---
I forgot about that, played some no mither rounds yesterday and I feel like my sense of hearing lowered drastically
---
Nice woooosh bait
---
i am with op here. literally unplayable for me cause i happen to suffer from migraines and the fucked sounds actually trigger those so i can't. i tested stuff a bit but it's seriously unplayable because of sounds. 
---
i also main Rin and Fred and not hearing shit is just... ugh. 
---
"Its not you, its me"
---
I hate you
---
Lol, good joke. But no, I was playing Nurse and Huntress
---
It is, though...
---
I kept disconnecting from the host a lot last night, I just reset my game. Maybe they were getting disconnected and thought you left so they sent you a nasty message. 
---
this happens to me every once in a while as well, not only as killer but as survivor as well, the game just ends out of nowhere. the only explanation i can think of is that the devs broke something when The Plague came out because this random DCing wasn't a problem before
---
I still like lightweight. I don't always run it but when I do I feel I can be more riskier in my playstyle and typically I can lose the killer easier
---
Wow that was good! I actually feel pretty bad for that hag with all those missed hits. 
---
I like the new rank update because I sometimes get rank 1 survivors that act like rank 15.
---
Hey OP, could you turn your location on? I just wanna talk. 
---
I've had a higher DC rate as well since the patch. I'm also getting real extremes of games. I seem to either get stomped or pull a 4K, very little in the middle
---
I'm a Myers main and spend most of my time in the green ranks.
---
Open Gate music and Chase Music is so loud now that I actually do lose people sometimes, especially when they run Dance With Me. 
---
He low key kinda looks like Hank Hill, and i fuck with it
---
Wraith would make an amazing mob crime/ drama film
---
Huntress would make a great horror movie
---
Nurse would be a good psychological horror movie.
---
Hag would make a great thriller (story kinda reminds me in a way of Split)
---
Oh alright. Shoulda guessed, mb. 
---
you know you can easily just hide if they turn around to end the chase. they lose sight of scratch marks for ages which gives plenty of time to run and hide. unless you're on lerys then he can just track the blood from across the map. gg.
---
Damnit, that was the first joke came to mind
---
Gotta admit, I am terrified to imagine the possible sound and visual bugs that would come with this rework. Nice idea though. 
---
Thanks. I said GG and got called toxic for whatever reason üòÖ
---
I'm somewhat new. Got the game during Lunar event. I have no fucking idea how I'm supposed to get Adept Shape now running his weird ass perks all together. 
---
Unless it changed you just have to kill all 4 not get an actual merciless victory
---
I thought it was abit weird. I was playing survivor on Ormond, and I was just thinking about how fucking beautiful the map looks now in the new update, like the snow looks so much better and the fog looks  really frosty. 
---
Then out of nowhere a huntress just hits me in the back and I swear the heartbeat was still just a little thump-thump, as if she was still far away.
---
I feel like pig just isn't good enough for her own movie, maybe as a side character though? That sweater boi could make something interesting though 
---
Devour hope but with instadown, that‚Äôs a better feeling lol
---
give it her a little halloween medkit/lunchbox and make her go back to school ala billy madison and i'd watch it
---
it has. to get a merciless victory now you have to double pip which is near impossible at red rank with only a killers base perks. 
---
You both need to shut the fuck up oh my god

Thatd be a real big twist if she was the first victim and then fell in love with her assailant? That way no one would really see it coming ya know? Stalky boi has a really strong chance to succeed with all of the suspense you could add. Maybe use his music anytime he gets caught stalking someone.
---
I hope you were able to fix it by now or it fixed itself. It's like the other guy said. You need to go to steam, rightclick on the game go to properties and there validate your game files. For me it said 1 file was corrupt and replaced it and I was good to go again.
---
I never get to red ranks despite 4king every game. Because if the emblem system 
---
Is there a source? Or is it a Photoshop?
---
Second one should‚Äôve been no-one left behind
---
He ran left behind
---
Its said merciless victory for ages though even when it changed from 4k to double pip. Ive still got the achievement 4king
---
I would never 
---
Of anything killers are UP
---
Never going to happen unfortunately.
---
Dr Frankenstein or his monster...which one  :-p
---
Oh God, if you were a symmetra main, then you have nothing to worry about 
---
unless their leatherface face-siters
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
The basement literally only spawns in two places the killer shack or whatever main building that map has.
---
I feel like I'm the only one who is having a good time with the new matchmaking. I get a lobby every 1-3 mins and for killer it's 2-3 mins. I used to wait 30 mins for one survivor match and Killer was quick like always. I don't run into to laggy lobbies either. I guess I'm lucky. 
---
That was my thought too lol! 
---
Always thought stramsniping is a reportable offence. Wonder why is that
---
why does unbreak-a-bill, not look like Bill?
---
It's one of those meme where a guy walks into the hospital and sees someone and walks out. It's know as "loss meme"
---
I‚Äôm rly disappointed in myself cuz I just watched this whole thing and wasted 2 minutes of my life.... :)
---
Of course but I actually find a lobby within a minute too. 
---
Head on, apply directly to the forehead?
---
IM LIVING FOR THIS
---
I wouldn't say that you were toxic in the slightest but using the flashlight against her was probably what made her think that.
---
Good job  :)
---
Exactly!
---
I feel like Until Dawn wouldn't really work seeing as the "killer" (not naming cos spoilers) didn't actually kill anyone and had no intention of doing so. Unless you want the Wendigo to be the Killer.
---
Is this...
---
I also adjusted it to revert Exit Gate progress so there's more motivation to save it for later.
---
I would love to have this feature because whenever a new map is released, you can't explore it properly. 
---
In a public match if you take the time to study how the new loops work and overall map generation, you will me hurting your teammates.
---
I also like to search for the golden toolboxes and this is too time consuming to ask a friend to join a KYF lobby. 
---
For a second I thought Myers was just flexin‚Äô in him
---
Camping is a legit strategy
---
Love how they didn‚Äôt use Lightweight on Jane.
---
She too T H I C C
---
Thanks for being the 758th person to post this.
---
Legion is a braindead of a killer. i use them when i feel bad about myself, cause they give me guaranteed 4k and ez game. i don't even use Frank's for it. it's just really easy to play them and only completely trash players can't pull off kills with Legion(unless Lery's and Rancid Abattoir, don't know why but when i get these maps as Legion i fukin get demolished just like all Legions i face on those unless they play dirty). 
---
Hello I guess?
---
In Australia, where there's never really been an issue getting a decent match even at high ranks, reasonably quickly, we're now being lumped in with Brazilian and Japanese players, getting constant 400-700 ping players joining fresh lobbies in under a minute. It's fucking ridiculous how much they've thrown out any playability for "oh maybe people won't dodge SWF as much!"
---
I have no issues with sound, try doing what I always have, turn on sound equalization in sound settings of your device. Makes quieter sounds louder and loud sounds quieter.
---
Happened to me too, there was a patch that occured in the middle of my game so when I got back to the main menu I was told it would take over a half hour
---
He just went super Saiyan
---
I don't camp or tunnel. I do slug when I see an opportunity to. I'm on PS4 so I have some really good games but like you my problem is consistency. I'll have some games where I can't hit anyone. Framerate makes it even worse along with sensitivity. You have any gamplay?
---
I had a surv report me because I hooked him after his entire team dc'd.
---
I downed 1 dude then 3 of them left.
---
I let this last guy repair 5 gens then hooked him so he and I wouldn't depip. 
---
Such is dbd.
---
I have said this before, stalling a Legion is possible, but you can't counter them/loss them, you will go down. Sure, this holds true for many killers if they keep chasing you, but none of them make me feel as helpless and mad as when a Legion, who i have successfully looped enough for a gen to pop, decides to start moonwalking or staying out of the chase while keeping an eye on me. I would be fine going against a normal Legion any day for sure, but jesus most of them instinctively use that strategy if they feel they got looped too long.
---
I always run lightweight but I feel like killers lose me way easier if I use it but this video makes it seem kinda bad. Hmm.
---
I guess it is better when breaking line of sight and juking in jungle gyms instead of going a straight line.
---
That only works when carrying a survivor 
---
I thought it was too but I guess there‚Äôs no proof
---
I play on ps4, you have any idea on how to do that?
---
Not as bad on PS4 they just ruined the game for PC because pings are all over the place, old Matchmaking, the bucket system, was faster, still awful pings, tho.  The oldest form of matchmaking in the game, good pings, long waits, the bucket system needs a rework and killers shouldn‚Äôt have to wait to make a lobby because it makes wait times longer for survivors.
---
New killer revealed. Play Dough. 
---
I have no idea about console but if it's possible I'm sure Google will have an answer. 
---
The whole legion gimmik is communication so I totally agree, some top teir legions choose to just injure the entire team and leave them to scatter of collect in which he becomes more powerful. 
---
The PTB revealed multiple reasons to why this mechanic was postponed. 
---
Killer shouldn't be able to close the hatch until they addressed all the issues involving end-game scenario. 
---
I build my survivors the same way, but with self care in the mix
---
The first Jane perk always reminds me of ‚ÄúRev up those fryers!‚Äù
---
Fuck that, DbD is literally screaming out for guro. We got hooks, chainsaws, hammers, knives, machetes, claws, even violent tentacles. And let's not forget Spirit being the way she is, either.
---
I don't know how in the hell this hasn't been exploited yet.
---
Yes please
---
There is supposed to be a gate there until that gen is done. Guess it was invisible
---
Is It cause they spam frezy and just try to down you with that not realizing that‚Äôs not how you use it or are they trash players in general?
---
Nice cosplay. Where did you buy piggy mask?
---
Don't need a hatch closing mechanic. Just make the animation when a survivor jumps in longer than the killer has cooldown on his attack and also let killers grab survivors when they jump in out of downed state.
---
I hate facing plague, she feels like legion, but if legion was good
---
My girlfriend bought the Pig mask from Trick or Treat Studios, and decided to sew a black wig to it.
---
trash players in general. don't know of map control and how to even properly play killer(not just Legion). 
---
Unless they face sit you then just take one for the team üëçüèª
---
The hatch is badly designed for both sides, so no. It needs changing. 
---
Ranks are much more inconsistent for me. 
---
"Because, get in there Sonny, Don't be a chicken"
---
Rank never mattered. 
---
I wouldn't mind to be in Dwight's place 
---
I thought ‚Äúoh wow this guys is immersed‚Äù
---
Yeah, this new matchmaking is making solo queue life even more annoying than it already was. It gives you a killer in accordance to your rank but teammates that are 10~15 ranks below it. 
---
Here is a recent match that I just played not even an hour ago: [Image](https://i.imgur.com/KN6kdBc.jpg)
---
You just need to work on getting better at the game. It‚Äôs ok admitting you need a crutch to be successful as a killer. 
---
&gt;Rank never mattered.
---
It matters when the game put brand new rank 20 ~ rank 15 players against experienced killers and other experienced survivors. 
---
Shes got a nice skull
---
I mean typically if a Legion can't find someone else they will just spam Frenzy on 1 person and tunnel them indefinitely until they down them super easily (especially with Frank's mixes) which is one of the major issues people have with legion as a whole.
---
Fair enough! üòÇ
---
 I have been using this, seems help a bit sometimes
---
Gets a hillbilly daily... deletes.. gets another hillbilly daily.
---
I see you dont want to play hillbilly can I interest you with some hillbilly instead?
---
Yeah killers definitely aren't op when there are about 10 pallets on the map, 5 of which are incredibly unsafe and 1 of which is the shack pallet. And killers are absolutely not op when nurse is still incredibly broken with extra blinks, legion has no counterplay and huntress' hatches go through half the things they shouldn't. Oh and of course killers aren't op when if you don't play swf there's a great chance your teammates are trash and don't know what they're doing so you get hit with that beautiful little tier 1 NOED because GUYS we need to buff NOED and even though you carried your whole team you get left behind to die on your first hook.

---
The teammate point is the key one - killers are balanced to a team of high performing survivors. One shit player can ruin the whole game for everyone 
---
I've played a bit of Survivor. I know what's irritating, what's enjoyable, and what's infuriating.
---
"Other Survivors" was the answer to more questions than I thought it was going to be.
---
I had the opposite impression, but does still look useful. I think after watching this I will hold off on running it. 
---
Tbh I don't care about people tryharding as long as it doesn't mean everyone is running Ebony, NOED or spamming billy or nurse. I play wraith a lot for instance, even in red ranks, and I actually have to tryhard a lot to be able to kill people because it's not actually the best killer. I never get toxic comments in the after game chat. I don't run NOED and I barely slug unless I spot the 4th survivor the moment I pick up the 3rd. As survivor I totally play like a goon with gimmick builds instead of "the optimal" and hate being punished/tunneled for not gen rushing like I'm suposed to.
---
First time I've seen a perk comparison video for this perk. It's so bad lol.
---
I fear no man, but that thing it scares me
---
Whats the difference?
---
I‚Äôm rank 14 survivor. Past three games- rank 4,3,2 killers. All plagues
---
Hahahahaha
---
Ever heard a survivor breathing without Stridor? It‚Äôs that level.
---
Agreed!
---
Fair enough. 
---
I never feel like it's too unbalanced. Sure, the game might lag sometimes and I get hit through a wall,  but 9 times out of 10 I go down making risky moves and get punished for it 
---
Yes because I feel sorry for the killer losing offerings because people suck and it becomes a waste of a game.  So I try and get the killer to farm as a way of apology.
---
That hair especially 
---
... Is this real life?
---
Leaked switch gameplay
---
Welcome to jackass
---
Bahahahaa
---
This is a serious question because it's not fun from a survivor standpoint but why play killer if you know you have bad internet? Is it still fun?
---
Even the killer's like:
---
Wait, what 
---
It affects the killer because it‚Äôs harder to see the survivors and for survivor, it‚Äôs harder to see the killer
---
Agreed, it's just suppose to be a fun game. Learn from your mistakes and get better, or just try playing for fun. 
---
Survivors are certainly guilty of quitting too. 
---
Really should be a harsher penalty for quitters and/or increased bonus for those left behind.
---
Well I already see survivors complain about Plague here, seems like you guys aren't annoyed only by what, wraith, pig and freddy? 
---
Nicely done. That's a very solid rebuttal if I've seen one. 
---
Yep, I had to do the exact same thing with the same one file being busted. Thanks for the reply.
---
&gt; Vile Purge can barely be dodged
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
^^hi ^^im ^^a *^^tree*
---
On a loop where there's no walls you have to time your crouch very well to maintain the loop afterwards. For example, I was looping a Plague in Blood Lodge on a pallet next to the truck. She prepared to puke and I crouched behind the truck. After she was done I stood back up but I still got hit somehow even though I saw no more puke flying around. The hit box is just very off and nonetheless, she's still mindless. If you don't lose her during a chase, you're fucked. 
---
Give That Totem A Good Ol' Rub
---
its ez af to get it as solo survivor lol
---
I didn‚Äôt question NOED‚Äôs state I said itd still have the same problems with or without. You getting it faster doesn‚Äôt change the actual over arching problem about it that remains a genuine problem.
---
Your logic here is flawed in that because killers are usually balanced against SFW, that I hero they must be OP to solo q. Solo q isn‚Äôt OP at all it‚Äôs balanced, survivors are able to do the same things as SFW outside of verbal communication; coordination is just much harder. Solo q can still body block, flashlight, loop, work together, etc just not in such an OP scale as SFW which is fine. The problem is other solo q survivors being bad at the game or just being dicks but that isn‚Äôt actually a problem with how strong killers. Many survivor nerfs that happen are due to SFW but many of them are also valid with or without them, such as the exhaustion nerf that helped good survivors keep a chase on for decades, borrowed time gave all survivors another get out of jail free card with very little counter play, D-strike deserved a nerf as it quite literally was a get out of jail free card to extend a chase(don‚Äôt know how I feel about the route they choose to go with it but a change was called for), etc... 
---
So again while there are valid concerns on aspects of the game here, in my opinion that just doesn‚Äôt make killers as a whole OP
---
I don't personally see her as OP yet, haven't played enough against her to get a solid opinion on that, but I do think she's very annoying and mindless to play against. Just like Legion. 
---
You already got 3 kills just give the survivor hatch you try hard asshole
---
I'd buy this cosmetic tbh.
---
First thing I do off the hook is get that sweet H2OhNoMorePuke. Unless my fucking teammate takes the closest fountain cause they got a ickle bit sick, condemning me to be broken for longer than I should be. 
---
You're probably right. But even when there's absolutely no rewards for ranking up I can't shake the feeling that the game has become more "punishing". With this new system sometimes you think you did a good job during a trial only to find out at the end of it that you didn't gain a single pip or even just lost one. 
---
What...what the hell? Do you honestly think that's a good comeback? To *anything*?
---
How old are you? Probably around middle school age, I'd guess?
---
I fucking agree. Playing solo survivor and im always left to 2nd state. And then the other survivors use all the pallets so im left fucked
---
I had some little wiener msg me on PS4 saying he'd reported me for hacking. Which was weird because he was the one that had DC'd when we'd finished the 4th gen and I really didn't see anything special about the game. He started swearing away, and I told him I was going to report him, he keeps ranting, I tell him to keep it coming, and he then says "I'm reporting you for threatning to report me!" Which was... weird but okay. So, I reported him, and I'm assuming he reported me, and it was actually pretty swift within like 10 minutes of the report going through I got the msg from the playstation people saying it was processed and appropriate action was taken.
---
I still wish I'd asked just what he saw that looked like hacking, but I'm assuming he was just pissed off we were winning.
---
'Mixed'
---
Trying to explain, this to my friend is harder than nurse games
---
I like the Plague. I think she's pretty balanced, but holy shit those addons need a bit of a tweak. Even just running Moderately increase file purge effectiveness I get them broken in about a like and a half. 
---
Yeah, or PC players if their settings are too high for their computer.  
---
I‚Äôm not saying laggy skill checks don‚Äôt exist, just that they have nothing to do with ping.  
---
Especially finding invisible claudette, but with Doctor, I don't think fog really matters. 
---
Personally, and I switch from killer to survivor pretty often. I dont think theres a problem with NOED. Its easily counterable. Just break the dull totems if your suspecting them running it. And there's perks that can make it even faster breaking them.
---
You could de-rank because ranks mean literally nothing.
---
For survivor I use: Lithe, Quick &amp; Quiet, Bond, and Iron Will. 
---
For Freddy I use: Save the Best for Last, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring. 
---
Well. I thing i noticed is that most Plague users try to break you before hitting you. So take that as an advantage, go into loops, they try to vomit you but they hit walls, obstacles, etc. So they waste a lot of time trying to break you. You can't dodge vomit running in a straight line, so don't try to escape from her. That's it, loop while avoiding her vomit.

Legion bad gib 3 karma plz. 
---
You get the notification that action has been taken.
---
imagine getting looped by a claudette but instead of tbagging they default dance at every pallet
---
While thats true, i was trying to mock Op for making this issue seem like a survivor sided one without acknowledging that it's just as bad for either side
---
It's nice to dream, isn't it?
---
But knowing you have that much of an advantage, 
---
wow you got chased for roughly 1/5th of a second
---
Every survivor has the choice to dodge my lobby, by staying there and checking ready or staying there for the 30 seconds they have they can leave at any time. They chose to get in the game. That's not my fault with as heartless as it sounds.
---
Personally. I don't give a shit if the forth escapes. But it still bothers me that one survivor escapes when that team sucked, still, not enough to do a stand off.
---
Suck my dick
---
Very true, I think most of the instances I'm taking about is where the killer has 60 ping but then all of a side everyone is rubberbanding and teleporting all over the place. I definitely get what your saying though
---
dude, if the plague managed to walk up to the your butt, put you to a broken then get an m1, its 80% on the you since you somehow didn't reach a pallet or window at that point, the other 20% is when the game decides to not give you anything to work around and you get outplayed.
---
With that stated, it probably works over 50% times cause its the dbd community
---
I play Freddy and plague :)
---
Dead silence...
---
Piano music intensifies!
---
His hair poofs into super saiyan hair.
---
They need to extend MM time period and match killers and survivors with their respective rank. What the hell am I supposed to do against a rank 2 hilly with 2 rank 13 urban evasion neas? Suffer? He can shut the match down without even trying. 
---
I'd say I'm a fairly decent survivor. My comment did make it sound like I was the potato allowing the killer to hug me but I pretty much always manage to find a loop before I'm down. It's the potato teammates I have to work with that allow her to get close. Sorry for the misunderstanding. 
---
HELL YEAH 
---
Or it's just a meme for a game I like. 
---
I wish more people watched painkillers 
---
Lmfao. How do you even hide when Distressing and Treatment mode finds everyone. You even get to use Whispers to be sure youre hitting someone. That guy clearly doesnt know how to play Doctor.
---
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT IT SENT ON OR DOES REDDIT ACTUALLY ALLOW PICS TO BE SENT?
---
The devs need to get on top of fixing bugs asap and put new content on the backburner for a bit. This patch also seems to have reintroduced previously fixed bugs like the pallet sliding.
---
We haven't gotten a good Freddy rework because this brat is bugging his uncle to ban people that are better than him, confirmed?
---
It affects both survivors and the killer. Generally speaking as killer you want your fog as thin as possible but some stealth killers can use it to their advantage. More expirianced survivors will most likely thin out the fog so they can see the killer at all times
---
Disconnecting is far more consistent, I'll stick with that
---
We found the killer main
---
the spirit is in a lot of ways very similar to the grudge and other japanese horror like it
---
yep but survivors are op and need to keep getting nerfed. just because you present it in meme form doesn't make you any less of a hypocrite 
---
He was really bad. It was rank reset tho and my team sucked ass. Idk how he was so bad. Doctor can find anyone pretty damn easily
---
I‚Äôve seen this porno.

i have fun playing against Legion THERE I SAID IT

I support the DS changes, and that comes from a survivor main that barely plays killer. I never used DS in the previous patches because I thought it was unfair.
---
Now, with that said, I fucking hate this patch. The Plage herself is okayish but I can't find a game where I truly enjoy the DbD experience. I only get matched with 5 blinks nurses, legions or the casual rank 3 killer even if I'm only rank 12. And that's the good part, when I'm not being hookfarmed by my fellow Claudette or left to die on my first hook.
---
I don't know, I've only been playing for a few months but I can't enjoy the game right now.
---
WELL I ACTUALLY GOT INSTAGRAM THE DAY AFTER COMIC CON SINCE I REALISED I PROBABLY SHOULD, MY THINGY IS HERE https://www.instagram.com/hnnnngwhyamihere?r=nametag
---
:o
---
&gt;You already got 3 kills just give the survivor hatch you try hard asshole.
---
The killer is meant to kill you. It‚Äôs literally in the name. 
---
I don't like her because her puke hitboxes are way off and she is just a mindless killer. All you have to do is puke on the survivor, wait till they get injured while you can just play catch-up. You don't have to do anything in between, it's just a casual stroll. As for Vile Purge: it's basically just a buffed Huntress (a long stream of puke which you can aim while shooting it, there's no point trying to dodge it). As I said above about the hitboxes, I was crouched behind a pickup truck to avoid her puke and after it was over it still hit me because there apparently was a little more 'invisible' vomit after I stood up. 
---
This is what Fin the human chooses to do with his adult life :( 
---
Here's the thing tho the same goes for killers... Killers can say survivors are op but they arnt no one side really has an advantage over the other... 
---
Survivors have strong areas where killers are weak and killers have strong areas where survivors are weak 
---
So it's a balance and the game is balanced but bugged 
---
Yeah at this point I don't like playing anymore and I'm probably going to quit soon. Survivor is so fucking frustrating and killer is so fucking easy (unless you get a team of survivors who are all in a party together).
---
For anyone else playing the plague, in the killer menu, do you hear a wood smacking sound? I think the devs put in a wood smack sound whenever she lifts her arms and ‚Äúhits‚Äù the tree
---
Preach it brother

---
Whipped straight into Dead By Daylight 2
---
This reserves you a place in Valhalla
---
You see them as soon as they leave your terror radius
---
yes make them have a higher base speed and make it easier to get franks mixed tape
---
What a play. That David was a legend 
---
Not a locker in sight
---
it is on fortnite but thats because whiny streamer complain and that game survives based on young kids getting into it by watching streamers. 
---
More like fungon
---
What‚Äôs wrong other than matchmaking and piping? Played for a few hours yesterday after a long time off and felt like the game was in a good spot.
---
out of the few i looked at i saw only one that was complaining about "killers being OP" the rest were about matchmaking and bugs (along side a few about the new ranking system)
---
You always see their outline while they are outside your terror radius. If they get close you lose sight on their aura.
---
I've stopped playing awhile ago but have been thinking about getting back into it. What changes to matchmaking? Should I just wait till a future date in your opinion?
---
I haven't seen a problem with her. Her vomit is easy to dodge so long as you aren't caught out in the open which is usually bad news for most killers you face anyways.
---
Also keep in mind her puking on you is only worth it to her if she manages to make you broken in doing so, if at anytime she decides to just hit you instead then she wasted time trying to make you sick in the first place. At that point she is as deadly as a regular M1 killer at base speed.
---
the corrupted purge is a bit different sure, but just playing stealthy is your best bet against it, otherwise if you have to simply turning tight corners to avoid it much like you would Huntress is pretty effective. I've only faced her a handful of times so far, but none have ever felt unfair or broken to face yet.
---
ive heard ace is the quietest survivor from multiple sources, also have you considered investing in iron will
---
[Actually the melee axe is huge even on the huntress in game](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/758/490/large/damien-devaux-dbd-alftd-killer-character-art.jpg?1501031168) so it looks like that axe is kinda too long but not by much
---
Yep, I wish I could say I have hope that they will fix it, but I don't expect this to be fixed until after dedicated servers. We appear to be in a minority with this bug, so I don't think BHVR will care enough to look into it. 
---
you also can hear it in the shop,thought the game was bugged lmao
---
Nah outdated mode of thinking.  This was the case like 9 updates ago when survivors ruled the game but to be honest playing killer is really really easy now.  I main Trapper he doesn't need it.  Hell I'm murking swf at rank 1 with Freddy now consistently....Games balance has completely shifted you can play pretty much any killer successfully now no noed required as long as you know how to play strong killer games.  Lots and lots of map pressure and no over committing to chases.  The games are finally in our hands to win or lose even against the sweaty swf teams.
---
Darn, the free 2nd chance perk that had no reliable counterplay that all 4 survivors could run (and frequently would) is countered by a killer perk (that is purposefully designed to counter stuns) now. What a shame. It‚Äôs almost like this is what the developers intended. 
---
I just played solo and I still was able to pip

You don't hook anyone.  Just down them, put a beartrap on them, and go look for someone else.  They don't know where their allies are because of Third Seal.  Their allies don't know where they are because of Knock Out.  Let everyone bleed out.   Enjoy copious amounts of salt in postgame.
---
Best patch yet on console 
---
Nice cosplay
---
Pug is still a pos tho
---
Fair enougu. They should just work on a whole new endgame and eventually remove the hatch
---
I‚Äôve been a Doc main since September 2017.
---
Nope i was playing a killer and people kept joinin and leaving with red ping bars so I stopped playing killer.
---
The connection was fine for me being a survivor
---
I like you
---
New matchmaking system seems to disregard rank diversity and instead search for ping. Something like that is the only thing I have in mind. 
---
It can also just be searching to find the first 4 people that are waiting in lobby as survivor to try and speed matchmaking up. It would explain why some people complain of being brought to killer lobbies with red ping.
---
I love Unreal Engine
---
They honestly just need something else, the hatch will never be balanced. All suggestions are bias and the arguement of who deserves the kill or the escape is right on both sides. In my opinion give the killer the ability to close the hatch, but either allow gens be completed at a bit faster rate, or allow doors to be opened. Cause that way the killer isnt gonna close the hatch and just stand there. If you got 2 gens left that's a long time doing a gen by yourself. It would force the killer to roam. Survivor would still need to go through the motion of opening the hatch so killer has time to check on the hatch. But I'm betting more survivors will try and finish the gens then the hatch if you can close the hatch. But as a mostly survivor main, if I gotta do 3 full gens at normal speed. I'm either gonna walk up and just get downed willingly or DC. The blood points arnt worth doing 3 gens by yourself. Just die and start a new game
---
Needs eyebrow ridges in the mask IMO. Beautiful nonetheless!
---
I think it just pisses people off, the way i play i always assume the killer has noed until someone gets chased/smacked. That way i don't get too salty and avoid getting torn a new one.
---
Nope, Freddy can see your aura instantly as soon as you leave his terror radius.
---
My internet hit the fan one day and this happened to me. They claimed to know developers and just linked a profile lol
---
Pre-scream nerf Kate /s
---
Thanks for the help. Maybe that was it. I know he's the weakest survivor right now, but he looks like he'll be fun to use. I'm not high ranking right now so I should be able to pull him off :)
---
pig cant be bought with shards
---
When you place a survivor to sleep and they have just gone through the dream transition state, they are placed into the dream world. You can see if a survivor is in the dream world via a cloud-like ring around their name at the bottom left.
---
When a survivor is in the dream world, you can see a red aura around them when they are outside your terror radius. When they enter your terror radius the aura will immediately disappear. 
---
If you are in a chase then the aura of survivors will disappear until you exit the chase.
---
If a survivor exits dream world you immediately lose aura sight of them and will have to put them back into the sleep world. You can use this to your advantage by watching what they do to get out of dream world. 
---
If you see them crouch down then it shows that an awake survivor is using the wake-up action on them, allowing you to approach and sleep both of them.
---
Your default terror radius is 24m.
---
I would heavily suggest using M&amp;A for a 16m terror radius. Allows you to see them from very close up and catch them off guard.
---
Don't listen to him, he is just jealous 
---
Well hitboxes were alot better in the past so not sure how that got fucked up but come on it's not a new thing i'm bringing to their attention. As for the new matchmaking system. How is it faster and better when i keep getting put with killers that are literally across the planet. When i'm in europe i should not get matched with a japanese killer. So for me and probably alot of others the new matchmaking is far from faster and better if i have to join 15+ lobbies to get a decent ping. 
---
Let's be real and honest here. Yes this game has come a long way but with every patch or new killer release they manage to break something fundemental to the game. Wheter it's hitboxes or matchmaking this time there have been plenty of big mistakes along the way. I'm not here to bash Bhvr but after months of dodgy/bullshit hits i'm frustrated it hasn't been fixed yet. Even the killer itself will admit that some hits are like huuuhhh so that says enough
---
You'll learn faster when going against good players. May also want to spectate for a bit and see how your teammates run the killer.
---
Don't forget the mandatory return of Haddonfield music. Plot twist: now it plays upon loading on EVERY map!
---
As a killer main, all I can do is the approving head nod and slow clap.
---
Dwight is pretty quiet especially with totems, Bill and Laurie are the loudest.
---
Claudette is pretty loud considering her "stealth" characteristics. I find meg to be quieter than feng. 
---
Infinite IQ
---
no u
---
Ah, thanks for clearing that up. 
---
I‚Äôm a killer main too. It‚Äôs nice to make decent plays when I dabble in survivor when my friends are on every now and then lol
---
I've had two people now sit through the entire lobby countdown with glaring, horrible red pings‚ÄîI'm talkin half-a-second delays or more‚Äîand then accuse me of "lag switching" in the post-game.  First time I had to look up what that even was, I had no idea that was a thing.
---
Some people just ain't happy, and they get frustrated.  Just shrug it off and keep right on going.
---
All I can think about 'did he got hit right after the video cut?'. Though it was pretty smart to prioritize pallet stun over hook rescue, many survivors just dash for the save and ez points. 
---
Oink
---
if anyone has seen any dev posts or things about this please share I got into a game where roughly 30 seconds in 2/4 survivors DC'd for no reason. Is making it near impossible and frustrating to continue playing 
---
You guys spot the Claudette yet?
---
Depends on your playstyle &amp; the perks you want. 
---
If you want a killer that excels at chasing survivors and uses strategy to catch survivors with good perks then Clown would be your best bett
---
If you want to have massive map control &amp; be able to teleport around the map with access to an amazing gen slowing perk then Hag would be a good option. 
---
If you want to have a killer that can cover large distances and mindgame survivors to high hell with decent all around perks then spirit is a good option.
---
A killer that can be relatively weak but has a power that allows him to bypass obstacles during chases &amp; has access to add-ons that break the game is Legion. Discordance is a good perk but wouldnt personally recommend him. 
---
If you want a killer that is good for time wasting and has the potential to snowball into a victory with her power then the plague is good. She's fun to play &amp; has decent perks with corrupt intervention looking real promising.
---
If you hate stealth and want to use your power to try and interrupt survivor actions to screw them around during chases then Doctor is your best bet. He also is great for making alot of bp. Issue is his perks are not that great aside from Monitor and abuse which is fun for making killers more stealthy.
---
Overall, I would recommend either Hag, Spirit or Plague. 
---
Hag really powerful with a high skill ceiling. Her perks are also great with hex ruin being amazing for gaining momentum at the beginning of the game.
---
Spirit has some amazing mind game potential with an excellent ability to chase survivors. Her perks are allright but not top tier in my opinion unless you plan on combining spirit fury with enduring.
---
The plague is fun to play with and provides you with the ability to make everyone sick which can really place pressure on all the players. Her corrupt allows for huntress like gameplay but with easier projectiles &amp; general faster movement speed. Her perks are all pretty fun and interesting too which can be incorporated into other builds.
---
There has definitely been worse. 
---
But these devs are notorious for releasing updates with an actual QA team. 
---
The community in the PTB is the QA. 90% of new bugs are not even fixed when the update comes out two weeks later. I love this game more than any other at nearly 3000 hours, but the devs have a very poor track record for quickly squashing obvious bugs. 
---
This and [Bedsheet Ghost Myers] (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/e9/5a/95e95abe4b655fdd4a365463c6e622cc.jpg) are the licensed cosmetics we need.
---
How is the game broken I‚Äôm confused? Is it just a PC thing? I have a major problem on Xbox and that‚Äôs the new matchmaking seems to be shit. I can NEVER find killer matches now, I used to always be able to.
---
I'm saving up for hag.
---
Ruin is amazing and devour hope can be a gamechanger too. Also i find her playstyle realoy interesting.
---
If you don't have BBQ yet then leatherface is also an option.
---
Are you man or god?
---
It is your fault. If you have a bad connection the game quality will decrease significantly for all survivors that join your lobby, no matter how close they are to you. Dodging lobbies is treating the symptons, not the cause. It's also lazy because you expect others to make up for your problems.
---
I tried in kyf and I can't see anything for real due to how fast that you are when you got those boosts 
---
The Devs have decided to work on improving the endgame gameplay instead of focusing on the hatch standoff.
---
Like for instance Survivors not wanting to leave, waiting for the killer to shove them out of the level, a survivor unable to find the hatch and Killer unable to find the Survivor.
---
All these are tedious and wastes time for both parties.
---
Maybe reinstall the game 
---
Thanks for the tip. I just got the Doctor as well so I'll have to lvl him up!
---
I have been thinking about that I just really don‚Äôt want it to come to that
---
If I work on scenic photos in the future, I'll keep your note in mind. I generally go for a Red Forest ambiance when I do my lighting, and I have done a number in the past I'm fairly proud of. Reddit doesn't care much about those though, so I stick to memes, lol. 
---
I‚Äôd be fine with this, mostly because I despise hatch stand offs 
---
Nobody gives a fuck about steam reviews 
---
Just try it I think there is no other option I can only think of one other thing and that is play a match killer maybe that will fix it
---
I keep crashing every game with d3d "hung" error. Every fix ive looked up does not work.
---
I've been doing this once a week to someone from Destiny 2, and I can confirm you can NOT get banned as long as it's not rapid-fire spamming since the "Block User" function is easily available
---
Well, is it a unique noise specific to missing because of Dead Hard, or is it her just her default missed attack noise?
---
Because she says stuff whenever she uses her weapon and doesn't hit a Survivor.
---
Yeah, that's my bad. I made it on Photoshop and then could not think of a title for the life of me, so just slapped that on! I play on PS4 at about 15fps and lag is very common, I just assumed it was server-side when it randomly spiked. 
---
If only Reddit allowed me to edit titles so I don't get another 10 comments with the exact same thing you've already posted...
---
First offense is just Playstation sternly frowning at you. Here's to hoping it wasn't the first offense.
---
Hey man I started playing this game almost from the beginning. For me i can never play this game for more than a week or two before i put it down for a month or so.
---
Dont get me wrong this game is an absolute blast, but for me the longer I play it the more frustrated I get. I always find that when I come back after a break the game is fresh again.
---
I already use Distressing on Legion, this is too easy.
---
I use it when I do my no game sound challenge.
---
Full no game sound build:
---
Technician, stakeout, spinechill (an exhaust perk)
---
It also lets you work on a gen in a killers tr without being noticed. 
---
There's no such thing as a hatch standoff unless you make one just let the killer kill you or the survivor escape, i haven't been in a hatch standoff in 2 years.
---
You were obviously hacking. You hit that dude from like 10 feet away!

Everyone already forgot about legion in general I'm sure it won't matter anymore 
---
I hope if it is that it gets fixed soon. Its almost impossible to play right now
---
Player count has been heavily decreasing since october.
---
I agree I love looping windows against him and double backing on him. Sadly everyone else does this and now killers know where the fuck I‚Äôve gone after they follow me through a window. 
---
Yeap. Had a game where I looped killer through 4gens. Only one other person was even hooked and they let me die on my first hook. Killer wasnt even camping. 
---
Keep stabbing them to down them and no hooks bleedout only,this is suppose to be a thing for kyf 
---
Thank you very much for your very detailed answer! I guess i will buy the spirit. It's time to mindgame survivors!

I‚Äôve played as killer it works fine there it‚Äôs just survivor plus it didn‚Äôt fix it if I can‚Äôt find anything else I‚Äôll just reinstall tonight
---
Makes sense. A lot of people were probably also doing their dailies.
---
It's the new and 'improved" matchmaking system
---
Im on ps4 as well. Been in queue for 30 minutes lol 
---
Ping (network lag) has nothing to do with skill check lag. Skill check misses/hits are handled client side and checked server side. If you miss a skill check, it's not because of ping. 
---
I have matchmaking like 15 minutes when estimated wait time says &lt;1 minute remaining. I'm in Europe region, PS4

---
Further goes to show how stupid people who rune UE are
---
Understandable, but the potential exists, which is a design flaw. There is no rush to implement something like this, but I wanted to throw the idea out there anyway.
---
Chase music is meant to be loud enough to block out most important small sounds. The devs gave their reasoning, but I believe it was something to the effect of immersion. You're chasing your prey/being chased by a murderous, magically powerful creature, you generally aren't in full control of your senses. 
---
You can‚Äôt buy leather face with irredencent shard
---
To get self care i played Claudette and i have to say these moments were really Nice ( with friends it's even better)
---
End game and stand-off are not the same thing. Even if you improve end-game, the hatch stand-off can and will happen. This is just a solution to remove one of the annoying design flaws in the game
---
I mean in my defense I do get a lot of greens when it comes to playing with both killers and survivors but if you don't want to play a lobby with someone far away you can just dodge it. Actually right now two greens just disconnected and I'm matched up with three yellows and a red. If anyone wants to buy me a better router and an upgrade to my plan I'd totally be down for that too.
---
Every time I pay against the Legion at least 1 or 2 of the other survivors DC. I had all 3 of them DC the other day without a single gen done and I thought the legion would spare me but nope. 
---
Beat me to it.

Happens on my doc all the time. Was practically screaming at the guy"READ MY ADDONS" and they like nope! Reported!.

This was not in a KYF but a actual match that the killer had to dc in.

It actually looked like the Billy hesitated at first, though lag may have caused it to look so.

In all video games, there is something unfun to play against. In League of Legends, there are assassins, tanks, Jayce etc.. in other games.. Legion. Ppl DC in all games if they play vs something unfun, but in DBD, there is no punishment if you DC. There is devs fault, not player's for using Legion. 
---
And Legion is fun to play against for me tbh 
---
I'm all for a disconnect giving a Hooked score event, and maybe even giving token for any Hook related perks, but you already get points for each stage. Getting hooks points just for advancing a stage while hanging there is unnecessary, I feel. 
---
Why
---
The 3 Ds. Deliverance, D-strike, Douchebag (op).
---
Was it a basement bubba build?
---
The Virgin Vietnam Vet vs. the Chad Hispanic Oprah 
---
\[PC\] I've had games constantly where people are getting randomly disconnected from my games as both killer and survivor. Last night I played a game where my entire swf group got randomly disconnected while i was the only one left and this morning I've played 3 killer games the first one 2 people random dc'ed and the next two 3 dc'ed. They will add me after to tell me it wasnt intentional or that they got booted but their friend stayed in the game. Is this being looked at ?
---
Reminds me of this one guy that accused me of hacking because he died instantly on his first hook when he was the only one left. He kept telling me that he knew someone blah blah blah. 
---
So they say they know someone and are not claiming to be a dev or something themselves but maybe the should get banned for claiming they know someone? Doesn‚Äôt the agreement say something about that?
---
Also, what is this 2007? My uncle? 
---
They had a [post about how it is supposed to work](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/31987/new-matchmaking-system-information#latest). They‚Äôre gathering waiting players for a certain time interval in a queue and then try to find the best matches among those.
---
Probably when there are still players left over when the ‚Äûgood‚Äú matches have been created, rather than letting them wait for another interval to see if there will be better matches available, they are simply thrown together to minimize wait times.
---
She ended up having to break the pallet and then chased me for another minute until the exits were powered and downed me with NOED. As you can imagine, she didn‚Äôt leave me until finally her obsession came for the save and she killed her with Rancor which gave me enough time to escape fortunately
---
Unless you were playing against the stachiest potato in the sack, there is no way you are repairing multiple gens as the last survivor.  A killer would have to be putrid to allow that to happen lol.
---
Nice. It‚Äôs a very good combo for solo SWF.
---
A lot of the big issues been around before this patch. Game crashes on loading screen with no way to reconnect leading to boring 3 man games is a huge issue. Also the bugged 3 man lobbies where no matter how long you wait no 4th one will show up. Weird match making games where 4 rank 12 survs go up against a rank 1 killer.
---
The list of those kind of stupid flaws that make the game less fun is staggering long and stay for a stupidly long time.
---
I'd your connection is that bad don't host games play survivor.  That's pretty bm imo.  Freezing survivors at windows and pallets for 12 seconds while they rubberband and can do nothing to survive against you while you just get to casually stroll up to them and down them us horseshit.  
---
Personally, I'd be breaking out the baby oil in this situation.  Poor Dwight, indeed. 
---
That's because legion was designed to win regardless of the skill of any player in the game. I'd encourage you to play other killers though in order to learn how to actually play tiles. Any m1 killer is a good example of it but wraith or man with machete is best.
---
Legion's base speed during Frenzy is a joke,the breathing and beating of his heart makes you feel like you should be going faster than that, do these addons actually do anything to make him feel like a speed demon? I may wanna try them out if my friends wanna go against my Legion, they won't dc at least.
---
Awesome!
---
I guess my comment isn‚Äôt popular enough yet.  People see the top comment, don‚Äôt bother to read any other, then post their own.  
---
I am also guilty of this sin.
---
I play on a laptop, it does run DBD, on the lowest settings and usually there are not problems.  but my first couple matches I had my settings on default which was way too high. Hitting a skill check felt basically random.  
---
For console players, I understand that this game is very poorly optimized and basically runs the way my first few matches ran and doesn‚Äôt have an option to lower the settings. 
---
Unless you make multiple hook saves, finish two gens and loop the killer a bit yourself you won't pip
---
Getting a 4k as the killer doesn't even guarantee a pip
---
Alot of people do actually
---
Yeah they do,If you got that stolen sketch book and combo it with susie's mixtape,then use nurse's calling,you are basically god 
---
Yeah that's what I mean they have to change it so when your then one survivor gen repair speeds up or something. Sitting at 1 gen for a full repair is just insta dead. 
---
No it was a noed legion 
---
I agree, the ranking is really whack right now. I think the positions of the black and red pips are fine, it‚Äôs just the requirements to get to those pips need to be heavily adjusted.
---
Same here. Wait times are completely inaccurate today, and also DCing when a lobby is finally formed. 
---
This perk needs a buff. 
---
That‚Äôs fucking brutal, I‚Äôll have to try it once I get my pig leveled up
---
This is some advanced shit and I love it.
---
Well, you're not wrong
---
It‚Äôs a game inside the game. Myers is restrained because A. He‚Äôs savoring the hunt and B. The entity wants its killers to do it that way to instill fear and gain power off the survivors hope. Also, machine gun builds were in the game. It was terrible and broken as hell. Don‚Äôt blame the game for you being bad. 
---
Does it really matter?

---
I so want to rip on you for being a trash camper but I just can't.  That survivor was just too funny man.  Delusional lol.  I can't in good conscience give you an upvote for obvious reasons but that shit is funny.
---
I sense a meme template!
---
Everyone hates a rules lawyer.  Especially when they're using the rulebook from the wrong damn game. 
---
Eveerybody calm down. They are going to change the ranking system again. Its not official, but everybody is upset about it and they are probably getting a lot of complaints. I dont see this system staying. I wouldnt be suprised if it gets reverted at mid chapter patch until they find out what they want to do. 
---
Your comment trumps all others. 
---
It's not a design flaw, it's a flaw with players all wanting to take the easiest possible way out. It's a flaw in the players, not the design
---
If you think looping is BM you're playing wrong 
---
And I did not say they were the same thing, but they are not going to look at this subsection of the problem and work on fixing that until they have changed the entire endgame.
---
Hell I don't even run settings too good for my computer, I lock at 60 fps and never go under 59 but my skillchecks are like 5 fps.
---
I-is the entity ok?
---
Haha you can rip on me all you want, but the way he reacts makes it seem like I was facecamping, when I was more patrolling around the hook, and a somewhat but horribly close distance, and while that‚Äôs still camping, there‚Äôs not much a killer is able to do once all the gens are popped and gates are open. 
---
For me it might be the first time I'm getting matches in less than five minutes (playing with a friend) and with green ping too, I rarely saw those :/
---
Oh wait a second?  This dude was freaking out about a camp with all gens popped?
---
More cosplay from you plz. This is fantastic

Just use LOS blockers, trees, and high walls as best you can.
---
If you get caught out it's not like the 2nd Health State helps much, but yeah, it's still No Mither; to a degree you're still shooting yourself in the foot.
---
5,000 free BP for an unbroken escape is more than enough.
---
DBD with controller lol
---
Jesus Christ lol!  I take back everything I said upvotes galore.  That isn't even a camp at that point there's no objectives left.  I'm genuinely shocked when a survivor even has the balls to complain in that situation let alone take it to the chemtrails, flat earther level that this potato did.  I apologize my man.  Hilarious post.
---
Well said, I agree. 
---
I mained survivor but kept plateued at rank 12 or something. I started playing killer and improved my survior game so much because you actually know when you'll have been seen. Too many rookie players make the mistake of revealing themselves to the killer when they haven't been seen. 
---
Disregard the previous comment.  Survivor was a massive pussy complaining about a camp with all gens done and open exit gate lol.  Give the man your upvotes this convo was funny as shit.
---
And all the salty killermains voted it up, literally any picture that says "killers are weak survivors strong" will get you at least 100 karma on this shithole of a subreddit. Also how's rank 15 treating you OP?
---
Haven't played the game in a bit, but last time I was browsing this subreddit everyone was talking about how shit Legion was. Now everyone is talking about how shitty he is to play against.
---
I am genuinely curious what everyone's issue with Legion is now. 
---
I don‚Äôt really understand why you have have to be so upset about it, I‚Äôm not bad at the game I just think it isn‚Äôt practical and the entity is just an excuse to give the cry baby survivors there win 
---
I main Doc, he‚Äôs basically the only killer I play.  I run the 3 gen build: Distressing, Unnerving Presence, Overcharge, and whatever fourth perk you want. I usually run Sloppy Butcher if I‚Äôm tryharding or BBQ if I want bloodpoints. 
---
What's a pip?
---
No one said it wasn‚Äôt a strategy. It just screws over survivors 
---
Rank 1 legion here, this is true. Bouncing as legion slows down the game a lot, especially with the blade add ons. It will give you enough time to end frenzy, and down them. If people are on opposite ends of the map though, there‚Äôs not a lot of options for me
---
[***HALLOWEEN THEME INTENSIFIES***](/intensifies)
---
To be honest, I used to always be the killer who would let the last guy escape. Not with the new pip system though. Letting that last guy escape can be the difference between a safety pip and an actual pip. 
---
for me it usually takes 5 min, although the timer usually says about an hour. Sort of feels like the number is taken out of thin air.
---
Not sure if irony because pips are so hard to get right now xD it's the thing you get doing certain things and need for leveling up.
---
Lol so people just play toxic as fuck but don't get called out on it.  Some solution.  Go camp someone dude. 
---
HA! Real nibbas use VIM!
---
Interesting. I play the game but never noticed this "pip". 
---
That's not the thing though.
---
Legion has no counter /In the chase/.
---
He doesn't get punished for missing and if you manage to out-manouver Legion he just laughs as he has 3/4ths of his gauge left and smacks you.
---
That's why he's not fun, and playing him is pretty braindead.
---
All of this is my opinion though, others might not feel the same way.
---
Now I am confused xD
---
my uncle works at mario
---
Same thing in PC.
---
Proof that the realm is just an aperture testing facility and the entity is GLaDOS with a time machine.
---
Shes not OP, but shes not particularly fun to play against. Legion is considered the worst killer in the game, yet somehow everyone hates playing against them. 
---
The broken effect from vomit into 1 hit feels very similar to legion chases. Many plagues ive played against dont even bother with the corrupted plague, since the normal vomit broken effect isnt much slower. 
---
The PTB is just an advertisement, they almost never fix bugs that are found in PTB. Happened with Ormond, people said that chainsaws and hatchets dont go through the middle building doors. Still wasnt fixed when released.
---
Think it makes more sense for survivors to get a bonus when other survivors quit, since it means you‚Äôll be getting less blood points from altruism and co-op actions, not to mention you‚Äôre more likely to die sooner.
---
By spam you mean litteraly only 1 extra whipe if the killer doesnt loose the survivor.
---
Devs legion rework pls!
---
Should have gone with the origional plan of a stalk mechanic...
---
Thats at rank 1, no? When you only need to safety to stay at rank 1. So does it even matter if you pip or not if you‚Äôre at rank 1
---
Nah because enduring counters it now, so that would just be a nerf. 
---
...just buff other survivor perks? Why does DS in particular have to be op? If devs are going to wake from their slumber and balance anything, it had better not be a DS balance again. 
---
No, they're pretty hard to see actually unless you're on Lery's, Ormond, or The Game. However, they're always there, even when the survivor is walking, and are much more reliable than scratch marks.
---
There is a Wraith perk called Bloodhound should you want help training to track them down.
---
"I dont like the game cause i actually need to do something now instead of just t-bagging the killer"
---
Once the game is running it force restarts the screen with "a problem is detected. The computer needs to be restarted, error messages are being collected, then the computer will restart."
---
Is this a known issue since the patch? Happened only after the patch
---
OP why didnt you tell him to tell his uncle to remove legion?
---
Any tips to get more deviousness points?  I've been puking allover and end up with less that 4000 points :\
---
No it isn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm not upset. It‚Äôs just ridiculous how many people play like 5 rounds of killer and then all of a sudden know exactly how the game should be balanced even though their suggestions would actually kill the game. And the entity‚Äôs not a lame excuse. It‚Äôs the story behind the game. It‚Äôs not even the reason for the attack cooldown. The reason is so the game isn‚Äôt insanely frustrating to play as survivor and basically unwinnable because one guy throughly ‚Äúcooldown is stupid just let me hit them again‚Äù
---
Solo queueing is very accurate and fast, but even with 1 friend it takes me over 8-10 minutes to find a game, and our ranks aren't even that far apart. 
---
Feng Min*
---
Mori counts as a hook for points. So if you want to maximize your points with devour hope you should mori them after their second hook.
---
You get a snazzy level of devotion to brag about isn't that enough.
---
The problem is that it just encourages survivors to play immersed. Cant get sick if she doesnt find you. And if you do get sick dont cleanse yourself at a fountain, just go on a generator and hope 2 people escape. Way better than Legion at least.
---
My heart aches for you 
---
Infinite load screen is still an issue; random DC's occurring really frequently; the new lobby system now arbitrarily adds a 2-4 minute queue to killers; the pip system has changed fairly significantly with little to no explanation; there is an ongoing list of gameplay, graphics, and talent bugs listed elsewhere on the sub; the DS change is making survivors cry; the reaction to the new killer, survivor, and talents seems to be lukewarm. 
---
In short, it's a bit of a shitshow, and I don't know if they even know how to address all the issues. 
---
How in the fuck did you come up with this bullshit
---
Y‚Äôall sounded like some hyenas lmfaooo that was funny af tho
---
Kindred has *ascended*
---
Its nothing more than to reset your rank to allow you to regain shards after leveling to 100. Perhaps in the future they will add rewards to devotion but for now it just adds a green number under your name.
---
Yea it's pretty good. If I see someone Kobe off a hook I just slug them now. This combo seems to be getting more popular.
---
Pizza Dwight!  
---
Praise!
---
I used to main him. He super fun, just pure chaos.
---
That was a rollercoaster ride of emotions
---
Bond has received a buff
---
Fair point
---
A happy ending for a pizza Dwight
---
Probably because it‚Äôs their 10th time in a row playing against the plague and they‚Äôre fucking bored
---
So basically nothing at the moment
---
Why was he running monitor on doctor
---
And that's The Spirit!
---
D strike is pretty much a waste of a perk slot now. Aside from making exit plays like this and even then you have to be very close to the exit for it to work
---
Unusual considering how easy it is now to depip as killer. Cant really see why a killer would DC for it. Considering how survivors are also having a hard time piping, the reduced rank wouldnt help find easier survivors. 
---
Cant really see any other reason for a killer DC unless they are streaming and don't like the map. Even then thats rare.
---
I think man, I was just bored and made it and decided to post it here 
---
Julie could‚Äôve been a hairstylist you never know 
---
This has happened before but with me I was looking at my friend on a hook and it just showed me the killer for some reason 
---
No, the first 10 minutes of ED2 retcon ED1 entirely by changing the number of kids that visit the cabin. I love all three, but your friend is correct in that ED1 is completely skippable if you only care about the overarching story plot. 
---
Only hit the unhooker if you can chase them down after the hit. Otherwise, you have to wait until they unhook and pull them off.
---
Don‚Äôt. It makes people mad and ruins your chance at getting a pip

I hate to say it, but DBD desperately needs a kind of ‚Äúbattle pass‚Äù type leveling system where you unlock things as you go.  All the leveling and ranking up just feels so arbitrary when you‚Äôre working towards literally no rewards.  Let‚Äôs face it, the game is very outdated, and could really use a bit of flair to liven it up.
---
I've also found that the &gt;1 minute wait time is bullshit. Granted, it's no where near as long of a wait as it has been, but I'm wondering if it says that to placate players.
---
15 year olds
---
That makes sense too. You can see my point though right?
---
I know right that shit was too funny and I couldn't help it.
---
5000 barely gets you a good offering when you think about it though.
---
Uhh... video games that were originally built to immerse you?
---
Still figuring out a method I like for coloring digitally. Sketched traditionally, colored in Photoshop!
---
To be fair, some killers are that entitled too. I had a game just last night where half my team literally threw themselves at the killer (swf op? More like brain dead with my friends) and I managed to get two gens done by the time the killer got the third person killed.
---
I luckily found hatch right before they could grab me, and then they spent the post-game chat calling the hatch a ‚Äúbull-shit mechanic‚Äù. Because a 3k wasn‚Äôt enough apparently.
---
PS I play both sides, and there‚Äôs issues on both sides. :(

Yeah its the same for me. Unless i can identify all the perks the killer has i break all the totems. I'm not a terrible killer and i plat as fair as possible. But for certain builds i do. Like my clown, its and end game build. So when the survivors are at end game they suffer the consequences of not breaking totems.
---
Just whack the survivor and get it over with, the devs probably won't change hatch for a long time. Waste of everybody's life to sit there and wait.

Not again...

---
Some others have pointed out a variety of things,  but for me the biggest issue isn't the pipping change itself, it's the way everyone has reacted to it. All my matches the last few days have been miserable. Everyone is so concerned with pipping now that there's no room to goof around or not take the game too seriously. Killers are extra sweaty, teammates are playing really selfishly, and playing as Killer feels like punishment.  Those things didn't bother me before,  but now it's the overwhelming majority of games. I'm struggling to have any fun,  which sucks because I like the new Killer and wanted to enjoy her release. 
---
Plague is very common becouse shes new and some people just got bored of her i guess. 
---
All he had to do was approach the hook with a revving saw.  He could have got someone.  Played it poorly and then everything unhook on was played phenomenally by survivors.
---
Ol' Ace "built-in Iron Will" Visconti.
---
Of course, he's a pretty decently sized dude, so he's not terribly difficult to see, and he's still audible, so don't count on it working all the time.
---
A lot of people waste time self-caring themselves over in a corner. I believe it's a waste of time to heal against a legion. 
---
That was the shop they killed the janitor in after Joey got fired of course.
---
Hey, who let this reasonable asshole in?  
---
*grabs pitchfork*
---
She's fun, but not particularly strong. Her own map seems to be really bad for her IMO. Gens get done remarkably quickly against her. 
---
Play Leatherface, his chainsaw can insta-down everyone, Insidious + basement is cool.  
---
I don't recommend camping tho, it's boring and gives no points at all, only do it if someone is being extremely annoying to you and want to get rid of him as fast as possible.
---
Maybe for other survivors, but not the Killer. Killer gets a lot of points from Hooks, so when a survivor quits they lose a lot of points. 625 is not that much in comparison if they quit right when they get downed for the first time.
---
I think more spreaded out scratchmarks would be a nice buff since its a bit weak compared to dance with me, or just any other meta perk you could put there instead
---
This is the only game I HAVENT gotten all survivors at my rank. I think I‚Äôll play Minecraft until this improves 
---
too much clothing for my liking
---
Dont ....
---
Why‚Äôs that?
---
I only complain about hillbilly because of the absurd distance he can cover with the addition of being able to one shot you and is stunned by pallets for 75% less time.
---
Ok I agree on that but he is still very bad in the hands of a bad killer and extremely good in the hands of a skilled player 
---
Ah right, actually forgot he's a licensed one.
---
If you were to run Save the Best For Last.  You'd be able to down the person doing the unhook indefinitely because the stacks make your recovery too fast for them to leave the hook.  At that point your literally trading survivors hook after hook until eventually someone's ass is dying.  You would get a lot more bps as well as more credit to your emblem from this.  To be clear I am only giving this advice for endgame where gens are all done and an exit gate is opened.  Camping with gens up equals babydick boosted scrub.
---
I can understand taunting a toxic camper but why are you such an asshole to every single killer?
---
So this is what a 3v10 looks like in DBD
---
Shit, that‚Äôs kinda me. 
---
God I would love a movie like that.
---
And then near the end the survivor loses hope and becomes a killer? That would be a nice twist.
---
He is purely talking about endgame meaning all objectives are done and exit gates already opened.  At that point the hooked survivor unfortunately becomes the games lone objective left.
---
Legendary insidious bubba
---
He's not very strong so people who main him are usually not the highest rank. No disrespect to the rank 1 docs out there though.
---
Definitely would hate a battle pass system, leveling would be fine but it would introduce microtransations that are something else than cosmetic. It just needs a leveling reward system, where every 10 or so levels you get a cosmetic or something
---
Oh thank you! I just might post more then :D
---
Exactly, I just reserve the right to be salty if I get hit through a window because of lag
---
She's pretty good if used correctly but that goes for any killer. Look up gameplays and see. 
---
Unfair comparison because the perk is way better than this. Its for losing the killer in houses with multiple corners, of course it looks bad in a straight line. In actual gameplay it works well. One of the best perks for Lery‚Äôs.
---
People who main a person make their place in tier lists wrong. I main Trapper who is usually mid tier but I can get my 17 4k streaks just as much as any Nurse or Billy.  I just don‚Äôt see Doc is what I‚Äôm saying. 
---
When I have one last survivor playing very immersed &amp; I wiped the floor with their team, I like to rev up the cannibal chainsaw and walk around areas that I know they are crouching behind. I dramatically turn the camera to look around. 
---
When I see them I stand still and let off the chainsaw attack before I start to chase them. Gives off some fun cannibal roleplay. 
---
For those wondering, yes the title is a Dr. Strangelove reference.
---
That's how vigo did it all along. Hes just good at coding the 3d printer and the entity is just one of the worlds best 3d printing coders
---
Um... Estimated Wait Time should be more then a minute like it says in the photo, or was there a rework to wait times so you get into games faster?
---
Kills through stuff like DH should simply award emblem points more than they currently do.
---
Yeah he was my 3rd main. I mained Billy, LF, Doc, Wraith, Doc again, Clown, Huntress, and now Trapper and Nurse (Console). Doc is just satisfying to play isn‚Äôt he?
---
I can‚Äôt stop thinking about Myers spinning in circles in different scenes of the Halloween franchise. 
---
To be fair I think its best to just buy the plague. The survivor's perks are pretty poor &amp; unless you like Janes appearance I would just get the plague. Especially if you only really play killer. 
---
Yeah, the *very* rare times I see people main lower tier killers like Doc or Wraith they are old school.
---
Oh yeah. I played him during the reign of insta blind flash lights. Watching toxic survs in level 3 madness panicking because their flashlights werent working was so damn satisfying.
---
The only reason you did not get out is you jumped off the hook when you had survivors right there to pull you off. They may of had borrowed time and you would of made it out
---
Man Doc and Trapper were like the best killers in that time. Taking out loops and flashlights like a badass.
---
Unbeakabill*
---
Visual bug.  You safety on a killer dc.
---
i like this, it gives the survivors a little more humanity.
---
Stop crying lol.
---
I came here for the complaints about NOED and lag.
---
It's ok guys he's trolling
---
My internet is pretty good but occasionally it spikes and I swear it always happens when I'm in the middle of a chase with a decent survivor, which is cool because I catch them but sucks because I always get accused of lag switching when in reality it was just my internet goofing for a second
---
DUFF MAN
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt say that was the only reason, I definitely could‚Äôve made better decisions. Buuut I didn‚Äôt want my teammates risking their lives when she was sitting right there, so I was just gonna end it all before I surprisingly jumped off. It didn‚Äôt help that I got stuck on those boxes tho...
---
The game already has microtransactions.  What I‚Äôm saying is it could use stuff like Overwatch has, where we can personalize our characters more and feel rewarded while leveling up.
---
Fucking hate that place.  All they play on their in house radio is Frank's mixtape.  You shouldn't need to listen to that constantly just to make my haircut viable.  Annoying as shit.  Half the time I just run out of there midcut.
---
I travel a lot and DBD on Switch will probably be my main game to play on the go so send help for a perkless Killer build lol
---
Dead by Claylight
---
Not OP, but my internet's not the greatest since I live in a very rural area.  Survivors still do gens and loop me just fine, so if anything I'm usually the one having a bad time as killer :p
---
Besides, I'm sure that Dedicated Servers will weed those of us with subpar internet out anyways.
---
I'm as neutral as you're gonna get, I play killer when I'm alone and survivor when my friends are on, I personally think NOED is ok because small game counters it
---
Looping is the most toxic thing a player in this game can do, on either side.
---
Pretty sure she's directly inspired from the myths that spawned those movies. 
---
I mean like where 90% of the battle pass would be locked behind a payment.
---
got a 4k at rank 15 yesterday only 1 pip.
---
K
---
It‚Äôs not though, unless you‚Äôre playing low teir killers or shitty builds the only challenge as killer is swf 
---
Her last name is Min you racist bastard.
---
She might not have the same map pressure as Billy or Nurse, but she can control gens pretty well with her puke. The survivors are either forced to get themselves sick to stop the regression or wait for the puke stuff to go away from the gen. Once she gets a few people sick she can snowball pretty well.
---
Yea she can be fun but in my experience in games winning is fun for me, a very close game  where I lose is fun for me but going around and hitting survivors with a rebuff that doesn't do all that much and can be cleansed in 4 seconds isn't great in my eyes
---
Not gonna lie, for some reason I thought the laugh was the sound of the plague getting stunned at first
---
She's meant to slow the game down a lotta bit, you just have to remember that the most sick you can get is being broken and while you're broken you can still loop and dead hard counters her pretty well
---
Damn and my friends complain about the dailies they get
---
https://youtu.be/z0UdKbGJs0o

deranking doesn't even work anymore, after a match it will teleport you back to your original pre-dc rank and pips

Can‚Äôt be any worse than what‚Äôs already in place, really.

I love using this perk. I never really got to see the difference until now. Thanks for posting.

Now its just a cosmetic shop, that you can also spend iridescent shards on. Its a solid shop tbh
---
Preach
---
Yep, ive seen that too. I like that the new DS is making these off meta perks more viable. Varies up the gameplay a bit.
---
It honestly doesn't matter and it won't be officially fixed until they fix the source code which is made of spahget that not even Josuke Higashikata could fix it.
---
Well, yeah. Both killer and survivor mains whine, but survivors are heard more due to therr being a lot more survivors than killers.
---
I don't think people take advantage of legion not being able to see scratch marks while in frenzy ever. While it doesn't always work, after taking a hit and gaining distance, you can hide move then hide again and mend. Although I run iron will all the time.
---
Game is the way the Game is.
---
Toxicity is what we make of it as Humans.
---
Don't worry i have a few -reps on my steam profile since I was apparently "camping" and I "have a sad life"
---
Was messaging the Survivors after I hooked one of them while wearing the Canadian mask. I thought it would be a fun little break from the game üòÖ
---
She says things when she attacks, sure it isn‚Äôt that?
---
you should've just accepted the apology, just wanted to make sure you saw it
---
Survivors: T-Bag a killer at the door who didn't camp, T-bag at every pallet, verbally abuse Killer in chat lobby.
---
Killer: Guess I'll camp, tunnel, equip NoED, and act like a douchebag too.
---
Survivors: *SurprisedPikachu.jpg*
---
Spreading pressure on different gens is a legit strategy against all killers, not only legion, you should always try to do that. 
---
80% of the players in any individual game are survivors so
---
It shows your argument is pretty weak when you‚Äôre gonna be pedantic.
---
And because killers are stronger in films, a completely different form of media, a multiplayer game shouldn‚Äôt be balanced? You just sound like a killer who needs the game to be busted.
---
Juke*
---
Yea but it‚Äôs a fact that bhvr failed to make this game an immersive experience, because if it truly was an immersion game it would have died a long time ago because it is simply boring as FUCK. 
---
And actually usually survivors that are immersive will screw up their team and often will let them die on hook.
---
Thank you for your common sense.
---
I don't face camp, I play killer for points and I'm not trash at chases so no need. Plus it's boring.
---
1k likes incoming üòã
---
If you didn't run into the crate after unhooking you would've made it
---
also maybe could've fallen outside of the gates if you didn't try spinning/swerving but might've still been short
---
Lastnight I had a leather face looking for me for almost 20 minutes as the last survivor standing.... but I have a question since I'm still new. When the second last survivor was killed another escape option popped up it looked like a hatch of some kind. Said generator or hatch? What does that mean?  Is it a hatch? I'm bummed he eventually caught me but I wish I could have found out what that second option was.
---
But you notice the difference right? T-bagging won‚Äôt make you stuck in one place and eventually die and depip you. Facecamping will do just that.
---
It's both, but the game shouldn't allow for a silly ass situation like that. A killer just standing in front of his prey, and the prey just boldly standing there. 
---
You can blame the players all you want but the devs should not allow this situation from the get go
---
But unless the lag is from lag switching its not a balancing issue 
---
I am a Dwight main who bought the game for killer gameplay but found playing killer too hard and became survivor main instead. Finally got to killer rank1 last season and it took me much more time and did me much more mental damage than getting to survivor rank1 o&lt;--&lt;
---
If a survivor gets down in 10 seconds, most of the time it's their own fault. They made a mistake, got mind game'ed at unsafe loop or ran to open area where there are no pallets. When the map is decent and the RNG of pallets and windows is good, survivors can loop the killer for ages if they know how to use them. I once witnessed a Laurie in my team looped a iridescent Huntress for 5 gens and got out without getting down one time. We didn't even know the Huntress had iridescent head cause Laurie dodged all of her hatchets, until a Claudette decided to teabag at the exit gate and got a hatchet in her face. 
---
But 4 blink Nurse and Frank's mix tape Legion are OP and no one can change my mind!
---
Hook them as far as you can from the gate
---
but that's what i always consider to be a "desperation camp" and that's really all that it is because you've basically lost already
---
In a couple days mention that you haven't been banned LUL
---
Gotta vomit on more stuff, my dude. Spread the sickness.
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with the killer camping when the doors are open.
---
Immersive does not universally mean "crouch everywhere and do nothing," it is just a term players use when referring to a playstyle. 
---
This game can be very immersive at times. It especially was when I was still new to the game. Some players enjoy immersive games, who are you to speak on everyone's behalf?
---
Survivors 'bout to get looped.
---
Camping when the doors are open is the only time you should be doing it.
---
Yea some idiot hate messaged me saying I suck even though I got a 4k with the nurse, so I then wrote to him ‚ÄúAt least I didn‚Äôt get 4k‚Äôd‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúYou killers should stop whining, killer is so ez now‚Äù
---
I feel like injured Claud might be quieter while injured compared to the other female survivors. Meg sounds like she is vomitting. Feng is a maimed dolphin. Kate is very high pitched. Jane sounds like she is getting banged. Not as quiet as Ace, but quieter than other females to me when I play killer anyway.
---
When youre the last survivor, as long as two gens have been done, a hatch opens. It makes a kind of singing noise and spawns randomly on the map. You can use it to escape. 
---
So if it wasn't boring it would be fair game? Your behavior is the same thing as a face camping killer.
---
Ok legion is the exception bc I've jumped on every Nerf legion boat there is anyone except maybe a two year old could get a 4 man with legion 
---
this is blasphemy 
---
michael don't need to chainsaw 
---
he teleports across the map 
---
When its put that way I suppose that's true , still blows tho 
---
That‚Äôs a weird looking Billy
---
I didn‚Äôt call you stupid.
---
I said you‚Äôre a problem if you think every last survivor is an idiot. That‚Äôs called being toxic beyond belief.
---
But you‚Äôre right. Can‚Äôt argue with you if you can‚Äôt read and see ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a problem‚Äô as ‚Äòyou‚Äôre stupid.‚Äô
---
Who are you to bring words out of my mouth? When was I speaking on everyone‚Äôs behalf, weirdo
---
Don't forget every lobby being 180+ ping. Also the random desyncs, at the very least you get the bloodpoints from those
---
might count as hook points, but not hook emblems, you need to hook 9 times to get iridescent devout and moris don't count as part of those 9 times
---
I don‚Äôt like nurses either 
---
&gt;it would have died a long time ago because it is simply boring as FUCK. 
---
No. I'm actually good at the game so I don't have to face camp.
---
You can stop trying to figure out in which hypothetical situations I would camp, I never do.
---
How can you not like ps4 nurses, it‚Äôs the most fun I have as a survivor, I‚Äôm always on the edge of my seat if it‚Äôs a good nurse
---
One thing is playstyle that is forbidden by the game rules. Technically you can use it, but you will get punished (I think Rainbow Six pro league has some examples of that).
---
But "toxic" playstyle is completely different thing. It does not break any rules, but it either makes enemy (or ally if that is your target) gameplay as annoying and unfun as possible. 
---
Camping is not hated because it is effective. It is hated because one player is forced to helplessly watch his death timer go down while others either abandon him or try to go for unsafe unhooks. First option breaks some made up rules of a typical survivor while the second one is a suicide. There are moves like teabagging that do not impact gameplay, but exist to humiliate opponent or demonstrate disrespect. 
---
Now in my own book of definitions there's also "cheap" playstyle. It is a playstyle that takes much easier to execute than to counter. It is technically not OP because you can counter it. It is also not toxic, because you just want to win. Mixtape Legion and Pink/Green Mori are the most obvious examples. 
---
A barbershop quartet but it's 4 angsty teens and they only perform metal songs.
---
*In my opinion*
---
I really wanted to change my review to recommended because of the DS change but the existing bugs are still here and we got some new bugs so I'm keeping my review negative :/
---
very good news
---
If you're trash and you need a cheap kill to boost your ego. You're barely gonna get any points for it and you're probably gonna depip because let's face it if you're camping the endgame you've been getting rekd for 5 gens
---
Advanced survivor tutorial Leaked!??!
---
You dc‚Äôd that much?
---
I actually really like plague, I thought her design was AMAZING and kinda took what legion failed at and made it good. She just plays like a faster huntress, but with clown strengths.
---
Get to a loop, and loop her like any 115 killer. I thought the movement speed nerf when holding puke was weird but I guess it gives her more counterplay. Plus she now has more map pressure since rescuing survivors off hook infects you. 
---
I feel bad for those who don‚Äôt like her cause I genuinely love her and fighting her. I await the day I bump into a prestige plague on live.
---
Imagine letting strangers on a video game control any aspect of how you live your life. Imagine.
---
Ignore the chat then. Press the button to make it go away.
---
Legion does everything that plague is annoying at but does it in a more annoying way? Also deep wounds is a lot worse then being sick
---
Why the hell do I care if you're stuck in one place, die, and depip?
---
You don't respect me, why the hell should I respect you?
---
Not you, you, just a you as in Survivors in general. With the amount of abuse Survivors put Killers through, you truly believe the killer should give a fuck that the game *isn't fun* for you anymore?
---
Let them escape because you're just doing a daily? Killer sucks dick! Killer's having an off game? Killer is trash and should uninstall. Killer doesn't give up the hatch despite both doors being open? Killer is a greedy cunt who won't let you get extra blood points. Run Meta perks like NoED and Ruin? Fuck You Tryhard Killer! Run non-meta builds like Agitation, Mad Grit, and Iron Grasp because you want to have fun? Garbage Killer.
---
I'm not going to sit here and try to convince anyone that Killers can't be toxic as shit as well, but the amount of crap that the Killer has to put up with makes it no wonder why they just say fuck it and face-camp/tunnel, you're pip and fun be damned.
---
I'm on xbox but it goes across the entirety of consoles
---
Bro I also facecamp tbaggers, I‚Äôm just saying that tbagging is nothing like facecamping because it won‚Äôt ruin a killer‚Äôs games, it will just hurt his ego.
---
But yea, if I t-bag then it‚Äôs probably because the killer is already facecamping someone
---
Yea I meant console nurses* not ps4 nurses
---
It takes about 20 seconds for me to find a match.
---
I wish console DBD ran this smooth.
---
The photo says less than one minute
---
Noice, smart...
---
But the forums is dev ran, shouldn't he know that??????
---
This is exactly what the lunge distance of Myers at tier 3 feels like.
---
I almost did that last bit one time without thinking about it :/ got halfway through and was like WAIT. (quench my thirst, unhook infected, quench my thirst). 
---
Not easy playing solo. And a lot of Legions stay close to the hook because it will guarantee two people being near each other when the hooked person is saved.
---
No, you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Even if you're down to only two survivors left, Camping one on the hook and letting the other get away is a valid strategy, especially if you know the door is open and the Survivor is still at full health.
---
- You find the other survivor, hit him once, he books to the door and escapes. Congrats you got on extra hit in.
---
- You don't find the other survivor, he unhooks them, they both make it out.
---
- You don't find the other survivor, he unhooks them, you hit and hook the same survivor. Congrats, same result just with more wasted time.
---
- You don't find the other survivor, he unhooks them, you hook the healthy survivor, they both escape because of speed boost and you're stunned.
---
- You find the healthy survivor and hook them.
---
Congrats, only one of those options was in any way worth it unless you have NoED equipped which means you only need to hit the healthy survivor once.
---
It's just much less of a hassle to just camp the survivor.
---
How Myers feels when he chews 5 Gum
---
This is still a thing? 
---
Yeah, just realized that. I really need to stop pulling late nighters. 
---
Wait, so survivors can't see the killers red light stain at all times?
---
Even a nerf won't fix them. Their ability needs a complete rework. Every time when I go against Legion, Frank's mix tape or not, I have to suppress the urge to kms. 
---
Ok are we just gonna glaze over him camping the hook? I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs the hero 
---
DIEEEE
---
DIEEEEEE
---
DIEEEEEEEEEE
---
DIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
---
^
---
did u get any kills?
---
I'm not Photoshop Wizard it's a rough attempt at what's in my head but I think it would help our hearing impaired friends be able to enjoy the game without breaking it. It's not directional it just pulses as if they are seeing a terror radius
---
Lol I run that with hillbilly its overkill,But expect the unexpected
---
If you are feeling flustered with the survivors complaining, I suggest this. 
---
First, turn chat off. Actually feels great because the insults and toxicity just stops. If you feel frustrated when losing a match then you can just leave without needing to say GG. If you won a match then you don't have to deal with being flammed. Would suggest privating your profile otherwise expect people to spam your profile.
---
Second if you feel terrible about being flammed by toxic survivors, give them something to cry about. Play Legion with Franks or be toxic to see them cry. Allows you to let some steam off and make you feel better. Of course, I wouldn't suggest this as a permanent thing as Franks mixtape is cancer but its good for the odd match if you want to have an easy one or just want to let out your frustration.
---
If all 4 survivors disconnect before anything is done, the killer only gets 5,000 as well.
---
  
---
Why should disconnects entitle anyone to a free "good offering"?
---
Had the sound go out on my headphones in the middle of a match one time, was insanely glad I play with Stake Out.
---
Rather than your little circles, it should just be a heart that beats in time with the Heartbeat.
---
Yeah, the rank 9 and rank 11 guys
---
But still very annoying round
---
They usually can. Your stain is tied to your terror radius. The smaller it is the dimmer the stain (at 0 meters there is no stain). Survivors may want to see the killer at all times because the heartbeat isnt a reliable source of information
---
Can confirm, worst hillbilly player on the planet here. Though every now and then I make a pretty sick chainsaw.
---
Whatever works I just think everyone should enjoy the game! The beating heart would probably be easier to design and match the overall aesthetic of the game but so long as we are talking about it hopefully the Devs add anything to help
---
No, it's a gif of a time long gone
---
-Run the green add ons for charge speed and effectiveness 
---
-Slug the third survivor 
---
-Remember you have to hook at least 10 times 
---
-Corrupt purge is your best friend since it ends chases fast, but don‚Äôt end them too fast
---
-If you follow the 10 hook rule your 3rd emblem will be fine 
---
-A mori is not your friend 
---
Plague is actually pretty good at the chaser emblem since she has to run around and puke on people to make them broken. The problem will be getting the gen emblem and the devout emblem. 
---
It's my leopard gecko Chase! I have pics of him on my Instagram (Graysonnara) :D I love him a lot 
---
Ironic, given the endless pampering killers have gotten with every single patch. Killers have bitched about pallets, vaults, loops, exhaustion, DS, gens being done too fast, flashlights, toolboxes, instaheals, Borrowed Time, and now they're bitching about adrenaline
---
Meanwhile, survivors have gotten nothing from the devs in literally years 
---
Oh thank fuck
---
Uh huh .
---
And tell me, what do you gain by camping a survivor besides ~500 points and a depip?
---
Very true
---
Yes, a hatch is an alternative way to escape for the last survivor. It spawns when the amount of gens done = the amount of survivors +1. So if theres three survivors left, then you need 4 gens done before it spawns. It only opens though when someone either uses a key or theres only one survivor left.
---
What the heck did I just watch #2
---
That killer is an idiot, but you have to agree that there are plenty more self entitled survivors the. Killers 
---
Death to the other side 
---
People like you are why I run this build and demolish trash campers.
---
Warning this video might trigger you.
---
At least refund offerings. Losing a rare and very rare offering feels horrible.
---
I got once for saying thank you to a dude who had a bad day, so they are (just avoid r/all and you're good!)
---
Nah, I made it in blender
---
This game has been broken and fixed a few days later many times. It'll probably get ironed out soonish
---
Gen tapping takes nearly double the amount of time to complete each gen, and the vacuum inside the radius would be only for using prayer beads. She would still be able to get gen grabs by starting the phase far enough from the gen, but it would become more punishing to fail it
---
No, I don't camp to purposely depip. I just don't care about pipping general.
---
This is a game with no cash prizes, no tournaments, and no competitive aspects to it. Turns out most of the playerbase plays casually.
---
That's not ur fault its actually matchmaking i recommend checking their profile and seeing where they are related to you. For me im USA and 160+ ping players when i check their profiles usually end up being EU, RU, or like Korean. I've noticed this a lot more since the update.
---
the ranking system is awful, matchmaking is worse, there's a shit ton of new bugs, and in general a lot of the game feels worse. They really dropped the ball here, super disappointed. They didn't actually fix the issues from the ptb.
---
Survivors still dictate the pace of the match.
---
Yep, I got all excited about the new matchmaking when I logged on for the first time because I thought it meant they already got their servers up. When I found out they hadn't I was like "what's the point of this new set up?"
---
"Why treat the customer this way? Because fuck them, that's why!"
---
Yes, that seems like an overpowered build in Dead by Daylight. I hope your looping skills are as great as your linking skills.
---
Question: WHEN AND HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
---
Someone here said it was from a long time ago. Was this a glitch or a mod thing?
---
The hitboxs for the survivors are so confusing between the killers persoective and the survivors, the game is about avoiding the killers but you can't properly do that nowadays. I'll be in the clear and bam I'm hit down from some unseen killer
---
Your point? 
---
Its possible you are affected by a bug that a few us have been trying to report since the 2.6.0 chapter update. Basically if your profile is bugged- As a killer 2-3 players will random DC from your game, while as a survivor you will randomly DC and it looks like the killer quit.
---
People complain about so many things in this game, but this is really something that should actually be addressed!
---
A bum ass run down place for a basic bum ass killer
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs hard to get less than 5000 even if you die, so it‚Äôs arguably fair to get more, it‚Äôs just that survivors already have a better deal than killers. 
---
If all survivors leave at the start then the killer only gets 2500, whereas they get 5000 if the killer disconnects.
---
Where's a locker when ya need one?
---
just run an injured build 4head
---
didn't Freddy get nerfed because rank 20's review bombed the game? if so, YES they do matter a lot.
---
Its a shame because this is a great new killer and the DS patch have made playing killer much more enjoyable but this is only when the game functions. The fucked matchmaking, fucked ranking and reintroduced bugs just make 2.6.0 impossible to defend and its a shame bhvr let such a thing happen
---
FACTS
---
There is a bug that a few us have been trying to report since the 2.6.0 chapter update. Basically if your profile is bugged- As a killer 2-3 players will random DC from your game, while as a survivor you will randomly DC and it looks like the killer quit. Reinstall does nothing. Switch Hard drives does nothing. Following their master fix guide doesn't work. I did submit a ticket and they said they are investigating it.
---
Even Claudette's falling noise is quiet. Man, she's so OP
---
They should actually buff some other Survivor perks, because I bet this game gets really boring when Survivors just use the same perks over and over again because they're the most viable. 
---
That's amazing.
---
When will you fix your damn game? or will you just see it die?! You actually deserve the dead game cuz of your incompotence of doing anything right! And that is not an insult, that's a fact! You are not fixing the core game mechanics, you just release new killer or perk to counter it, nah fuck off, only bad devs do that, and you are one of the worst capable devs ever. BTW the new emblem system is shit, teamwork is bad, you must do EVERYTHING to even pip, but at least ppl will depip easily and won't have to dc to derank. This is the only damn game that punishes you for doing your job good or awesome! You killed all 4 survivors in 2 mins cuz they were shit? well no pip for you! Garbage of a game! A phenomenal potential that gets crushed by bad devs that clearly don't know what they are doing! No wonder you're losing players day in day out! And you deserve all the player lost! When will the Freddy rework come? you've been talking about it for 2 years, gen rush is a problem, you're talking for a year now about 2nd obj, now you're remaking the end game and shit like that?! yea good luck with that cuz it's gonna come out when there will only be 2-4k players on dbd! 
---
If my looping skills weren't great I wouldn't make it to the end without having been hooked once.
---
Holy shit, that‚Äôs what happened? I remember watching a clip of Not_Queen starting a map as Nurse and the first thing she had to do was pick up her power.
---
I find that hilarious that it happened. That‚Äôs ridiculous :D
---
Duuuuud, ive had a nonobbession(old ds) Ds off me at endgame right into adrenalin. I died on the inside. 
---
Actually kinda like it üëç
---
Knife for close range, chainsaw for the snipes.
---
Probably because all of the things you are talking about were overpowered as hell lmao. They still havent fixed gens being done too fast.
---
At first, I thought it just caused me to gain less shards per level, but then I leveled every other match instead of once every 5-6. So... It seems that I gain the same amount/time played. My main assumption is so that it cleans up the menu as a whole. With the player level being a simple and easily identifiable number as well as the devotion level below it. This way you level can read 55 with a 4 under it instead of being 455. Just my thoughts.
---
I don't know about PC but on console leaving the match as a killer deranks you two pips.
---
legion bad
---
I mean survivors escape 50% of the time from my games but its still fun puking everywhere. She doesn't need to tunnel survivors to get any kills, which I think a lot of survivors enjoy. 
---
The only time I don't have fun with her is when I'm using the corrupt purge. That thing never works like how I want it too.
---
It's been tough, especially since I've only just lost a majority of my hearing within the past few years.. Some games don't even feature subtitles. We're looking at you, Spyro.. Crash.. And that's just unacceptable on so many levels.. 
---
How hard is it to go through the perks and try to make them all more viable? Feel like the longer I play this game the more I realize how incompetent the devs or their leadership is. Game has more trash perks than fun / viable perks. Not too mention how horrible rank is now that 80% of survivors just plug pull
---
I find the strategy where you're careful with positioning and do your best not to get deadzoned is an effective way of playing against her. (Like billy and LF) Hugging objects is also very effective because of how trash the collisions are in this game. 
---
She's slow enough that hugging a survivor won't work everytime. If there's one killer that has a projectile that I really dislike, its the huntress's hatches. the hitboxes on that thing is insane. 
---
It's like they have the Testing servers for nothing.
---
Do they even play/read the feedbacks? Or they just rush the updates because they are losing money?
---
I remember facing a Myers that reached unlimited EW3 then chainsaw sprinted to every survivor and down them instantly because he was running bond. The game after that I faced a trapper that was perked up with 3 agitation and 1 iron grasp. He downed a survivor, and while carrying them would essentially sprint around the map swinging and downing people. Needless to say those were the extremes, but a killer with bond was pretty common. 
---
It's not an insane advantage. The most theyl get out of it is seeing a heartbeat the second it starts which is unintentionally also done by The Pebble and Stake Out
---
I feel like a lot of perks have been buffed or fixed nicely recently. Surveillance and SFTS are good examples. 
---
Prayer Beads is great as is. A Prayer Beads Spirit and a Tier 1 Myers are the only effective gen grabbers on the game. Other so called stealth killers like the Pig and Wraith practically ring the door bell while using stealth since the pig moves too slow to sneak up on gens and the Wraith's footsteps can heard from miles away.
---
If anything even more killers should be given addons which completely remove terror radius until they are close to gens.
---
Wahhhhh wahhhh
---
Tip: if you get knocked down that close to the exit, let your teammates heal you. The killer will not be able to pick you up and will need to hit the healer and within the cool down you'll be able to crawl away.
---
yes
---
Only the third?
---
amateur 
---
I LOVE HIM TOOO, amazing idea and really well thought out... someone give my man gold!
---
Hello neighbor, now get the fuck outta my neighborhood
---
also zig zagging at the end
---
They can make it mute actual in game sounds when active, it wouldn't affect those hard of hearing, and could be a drawback for those who would just turn it on for the fuck of it.
---
But when that 1 times out of ten laggy hit happens then its fair to be a little salty
---
Ya I get that, but everything was running better than ever before this patch. I guess I‚Äôm just dissapointed.
---
A tip for survivors who‚Äôll witness a situation like this: if you heal the downed survivor near the exit line, the killer is forced to hit you, giving the downed survivor enough time to crawl out (because killer has to go through the wiping animation) 
---
You mean civilization 5?
---
Ive had so many glitches happen and seen glitches that happened to others and I only played a handful of games so far
---
People throw around gen rushing all the time that its kinda lost meaning or misunderstood. 
---
Sometimes its not the killers fault since its done so fast that there is no way to apply that much pressure. Most killers arent built to handle a game thats only 5mins long. That time is possible for actual gen rushers. Not even using best toolkits and perks. 
---
People who let other survivors die on first hook(to none camping killers) to finish gens. 
---
Hell iv had gen rushers who get gens done with ruin still up as if it wasnt even there. 
---
The objective is suppose to be escape(and pip) a 5 min game where you did gens and escaped is not a pip. Or maybe it is now havent played new system enough yet. 
---
That could be possible. Would also explain why there were so many DCs in a day
---
Michael Myeres.
---
That would all be fi e if the discrepancy between the volume levels wasn't so extreme. The chase music is so loud it actually hurts my ears if I'm wearing headphones. 
---
Yea I still find them 90 percent of the time I just wanted to say how hard they are to see sometimes, if they know where to hide so there camouflaged as much as possible 
---
Good job!
---
It is a whole lotta honest work
---
Besides, just repair for 30 seconds, then come save me. We got gen progress and I get saved a stage. Win-win
---
Yeah, it was definitely an *interesting* time in DbD's history.
---
I personally kind of wish there was a way to experience some of that same silliness, but it'd never happen.
---
It would make for one heck of an April Fool's Event tho.
---
Yeah, makes more sense that way. 
---
Good to see i'm not alone in this. I'm from Brazil and i'm only getting survivors from Poland and Russia. And they are all rank 15-10, i'm rank 1.
---
I think you need to turn your volume down then. That, or you have unfortunately sensitive ears
---
To your point,
---
1) There is no single standard for the use of a semi-colon. Since the semi-colon comes from a period when rules on punctuation and grammar were quite lax, its usage has changed several times. Currently, it is mostly used to show a connections between two statements;
---
2) To the above point, the use of a semi-colon is appropriate when a simple list is contains commas within itself; this helps to provide clarity to the statement;

It takes 1 person 80 seconds to repair a generator. 2 people would take 40 seconds, right? Wrong! It takes 44.4 seconds. There's a 10% penalty to each person for each extra person on the generator.

The speed boost is negligible without the killer slowdown. We‚Äôve already seen this back in the early days of the game. There was name near no cooldown when unrelenting and STBFL were paired. It was horribly broken. Look up old videos and you can see why you‚Äôre wrong. 
---
Yeah I see your point. Every thing in this game just aligned perfect for me plus I was solo queuing so I really couldn‚Äôt rely on anyone but when I saw she had borrowed time I had the biggest grin on my face lol
---
That would be cool for an April Fool‚Äôs event. Then again, implanting it and then taking it out might cause more bugs to happen XD
---
What's amazing is this the very first time I've ever seen this type of post. 
---
To be honest, they might be right. Their model seems to be working as the game is still relevant after all this time. 
---
What perhaps they should do is announce now that there will be a 6 month delay for new content, but with 'big' things to come after that, being the new leaked survivor, and a new licensed killer from another franchise. Pinhead or something. People will be tided over for 6 months while they work on bugs.
---
On every post until the posts stop being funny. 
---
Note: Only the bell would turn invisible, not the survivor. 
---
do you know what a joke is?

This is on the nose. Even the last sentence, I stopped using it once I became competent at hitting skill checks.

---
If I turn it down I can't hear ambient noise clearly, hence my point about the discrepancy being the issue more so than the volume itself. Since most people seem to have the same complaint I'm guessing my ear sensitivity isn't outlying.
---
I like the bodyblocking one because there is literally a perk encouraging it.
---
Urf
---
Head On seems to be very effected by lag. From the killer's perspective, they're nowhere near the locker when they do get hit by it.
---
I know tru3ta1ent has the infamous video of where he spawned in with Nurse when he was playing Myers lol.
---
Although it is cool that it shows the estimated wait time for the other side.
---
It wouldn't really be much of an advantage though, for people that can hear the heartbeat anyway.. It would function the same way, just visually instead of being audible..

Hey member that period of 6 months where sounds and scratches were broken

The complaints I read are from people being unable to hear the quiet sounds over chase music, which is an intended mechanic. 
---
Is it possible you've turned your headset up far too high in order to very easily hear footsteps/breathing? I have my headset at a reasonable level when I wear it to where the music isn't a problem and I can still pick up on breathing and footsteps in quiet moments

It kind of kills the fun of the game when you have some sweat red rank mixed with yellow and green survivors.
---
the image is a CZ SP 01. older CZ pistols have no bottom railings for attachments.
---
i've been getting that issue as well, i really hope it gets fixed soon
---
No worries, I was just bugged that it was literally the same photo from a 2k+ upvoted post.
---
You can always try another line with the same template though
---
Why are red ranks "sweat"?
---
Take the upvote and make sure to feed it 3 times a day.
---
omg I love Okiku, she literally rushes into investigators and explodes to snowball into late game. WN2 was an underrated game imo.
---
I never said they were all sweats lol, I said ‚Äú a sweat red ranks‚Äù FYI I‚Äôm a rank 1 killer, I‚Äôm not an entitled survivor main. These lobbies are getting even worse is all I‚Äôm trying to say.
---
I don't give a shit if this becomes the most downvoted comment of all time, but I honestly feel like many of the bugs in Dead By Daylight would be bugs you would find in a game in debug mode.
---
Thank you kind sir :o
---
It‚Äôs not like the devs are going to add it in you don‚Äôt have to say ‚Äúyour wrong‚Äù I just think it would be cool and make the game more thrilling but I‚Äôm sure if it were to happen many things would need to be reworked 
---
They can‚Äôt even add colour blind mode for people. This is like never gonna happen. Sad but true.
---
What's a Barier?
---
Was duoing with my friend and we had countless 3-man lobby bugs. Took us 10+ minutes to find a game at one point because we kept having to remake and requeue. I can't even imagine how bad it feels for the killers. 
---
You literally want survivors to have nothing at this point.  I'm a killer main and I loved the first couple buffs we got but it is getting ridiculous at this point.  My killer matches have never been easier.  People like you will continue complaining indefinitely until survivors start games in dying state.
---
I think this is actually a good solution. 
---
OMG your instagram is so cute! You are a hamby mamby :]
---
And killer egos barely fit in this universe they‚Äôre so big 
---
L4D even had colored texts for each SI so you knew what made the sound 
---
When you are tired of chasing people around with a kitchen knife 
---
That's kinda hot ngl
---
Happened to me in a game yesterday, too. Weird, but gone the next game and haven‚Äôt seen it since. 
---
Tbh that's why there needs to be dedicated servers cause working off of some shire wifi fucks with the while game
---
Having shorter wait times is all fun and games until someone dcs and you're stuck with a rank 4 hillbilly with ruin and thrill at rank 10. 
---
Can we stop making excuses already?
---
The OG PS4 can run 64player BFV, the newest COD, and more games than not, but the hardware cant handle 5 players and nothing but ridiculously dark textures if the game was made by BHVR.
---
I love all my animals more than I love myself tbh :') 
---
If survivors spawn in not being on hooks, I'll immediately DC because the game is literally unwinnable.
---
This is hilarious
---
Yeah make killer even more powerful, thats exactly what we need right now!
---
The game is the most balanced it's ever been imo
---
If the devs actually nerf killers/survs it's because trash killers/survs are mad that they can't get a clean 4k/Escape. 
---
No one is OP you're just bad at the game
---
Fuck NOED though.
---
Like flickering their flashlights and t-bagging

They found the hatch first, they defended gens enough so now, the gates aren't opened!  Oh, well, better sit here and do absolutely nothing while Nea t-bags in the distance.
---
I guess I did an ok job censoring at least one of the names since there is no Elliot lol, but it‚Äôs the PSN mobile messaging app. So basically an easier way to message on PS4 from your phone. 
---
That's a good good issue friend. 
---
I'm at a ***LOSS*** for words...
---
This change wouldn't really make it "OP". It would just secure it's niche as an anti tunnel perk. As it is right now, it's actually useless. This change atleast let it protect you from being actually tunneled.
---
Enduring really shouldn't affect it in the first place TBH, a 3 second stun is already a poor punishment for tunneling.
---
with the new updates rolling out, there is a new skin for trapper that gives a reference to the killer mentioned in the post.
---
And equally as annoying, if you use your favorite addons as killer and several survivors DC, you lose out on 2 addons. Survivor items for the most part aren't very important, meanwhile killer addons can make or break their kit. Wasting green or better addons on a 2v1 is not fun.
---
Nope too lazy
---
I'll take being slightly annoyed if it means people who love the game but cant hear can still get the full experience
---
Gold awaits for whoever takes up the task.
---
# FACT
---
Maybe not play for pips? I understand that pips are what technically determines a "win" but considering that pipping is no longer allowing fun builds or playstyles, then why not just tell this ranking system to eat a dick and play for BP? 
---
Enduring's interaction is fine because a single perk should not be a significant balance integer. If they want to stop tunnelling, they need to adjust the actual games mechanics. DS is still meta in SWF, just not in solo where buying 20 extra seconds of the killers time doesnt do anything because your ally is crouching around the map for some reason. 
---
Are Home/End still the PC character switch hotkeys? They don't seem to be working anymore...
---
&lt;3
---
Or don‚Äôt camp?
---
More like when the first 1/3 of the bottle of vodka kicks in
---
Just because it‚Äôs based off of horror movies doesn‚Äôt mean they should be similar. A plank of wood wouldn‚Äôt stun most movie killers, should we remove pallet stuns too?
---
Do you really want a game where there‚Äôs no weapon cleaning? The oldest Save the Best for Last gave 30% weapon clean speed when obsession was alive and was pretty broken. 100% for the entire match without taking up a perk slot would be awful. 
---
Aren't we all big whiners basically?
---
Yea, you can only see their auras when they are outside of his terror radius. Monitor and Abuse is really good on him as it shrinks your terror radius and allows you to sneak up on people and keep track of those in the dream world.
---
Freddy is definitely weaker but he is a ton of fun, imo.
---
"Give them their free escape, they didn't do generators and you already have 3 kills."
---
I wish there was such thing as an r/entitledparents for manchildren or dead by daylight, but as for now, I have to introduce you to r/EntitledPeople
---
You lost the game, accept it.  And half the time it robs the killer of a lot of points because they only got a 3k.  I found the hatch first, I shouldn't have to sit there doing nothing when there was a possibility the issue would be resolved already if it weren't for entitled survivor mains who complained it was "uNfAiR!"
---
Life isn't fair, you really think if it was a real scenario the entity would just forbid the killer from doing anything to prevent you from getting out?  The entity WANTS you to feel terrified, he WANTS you to have a slimmer of hope, and he WANTS to feel your sadness when your hope is taken away by the killer.  He WANTS the killer to be excited to get the kill, he WANTS the killer to get stunned, he WANTS to make sure the killer does their job properly.  Technically in the Lore the Hatch is a weird point, the Entity never wanted it to exist.  It was made by an entitled survivor main (Vigo) who thought it was a good idea to force the killer to sit there doing nothing but scrolling through their phone waiting for the Nea to stop t-bagging and jump in the hatch.
---
I‚Äôll leave you to it.
---
That doesn't look like susie at all, but good job anyway.
---
Not trying to, was just wondering cause I had a few killers camp and it always ended badly for them.
---
Wanted to see if it‚Äôs even a good strategy as it doesn‚Äôt really seem to be.
---
God I loved that glitch... playing blinking wraith, or chainsaw nurse... just so much confusion... I even got a Hillbilly to pick up a BearTrap from a chest where I swapped it against a medkit earlier 
---
Fuck are you talking about? Not that the game couldn't use some tweaks, but it's far more balanced than it's ever been before. Throwing all that away for the sake of ridiculousness is stupid.
---
That woulda be funny af hahahah
---
I'm just a poor boy
---
I can't count the number of times I've surprised survivors working on gens; and can only assume made them shit themselves; with the help of that glorious add-on lol
---
glad to help! the folks usually take a bit of time because they need to verify that shit so give it some time. :)
---
Okay, hear me out here... reading up on this an hearing some news from a week ago with "BR" in the tweets of some people who were invited to behavior makes me beleive that a battle royale esc thing might be happening...
---
Many of these changes are unneeded, and some downright awful.
---
This is pretty much me in the middle of every chase on a corn map or swamp
---
The only part where your wrong is your entire sentence.
---
if people could stop picking Legion, that'd be great.
---
Yeah lol.
---
Turns out you were double bluffing me, you knew what would happen!
---
at the same time when this bug was discovered i remember when you could put 4 Lightweights as a survivor and there was no scratch marks to see. kinda miss those times to be honest.. :D
---
Lol you are seriously like 7 months too late if you still think like this.  All the ridiculously broken shit survivors had has been patched out of the game.  It started with the most significant change we received which was the removal of the pallet vacuum.  They can't make most of the pallets they used to anymore while looping.  They then completely nerfed most buildings by closing off windows and reworking spawns.  They buffed several of our perks, from uselessness to potential meta.
---
I main Trapper, Wraith. Freddy and Pig at rank 1 with no NOED, camps or tunnels and I basically go into every game expecting a 3k or better.  Killers that still feel the survivors are in control flat out are playing killer improperly and without any intelligent decision making.  Most likely over committing to long chases with multiple survivors up and not applying aggressive map pressure.  Killers are to blame for every win or loss at this point, the ones that don't accept this will continue to lose.
---
Dont cleanse, do gens.
---
Only works if everyone else does the same strat tho
---
i‚Äôve had her throw up over obstacles and it still hit and also if you get even the little tiny bit on you you get hurt or sick
---
also why do sometimes the sick meter fill up faster

People almost universally disliked the pip system changes in PTB and were told there feedback was "being heard," but apparently that just meant releasing the system almost as is and saying fuck off to the feedback entirely.
---
A plank of wood would stun a movie character btw and honestly I can‚Äôt keep responding to this so yeah your right guess it‚Äôs a bad idea
---
I feel like the first perk is kinda useless and the third one is a little too strong
---
so is the only 2 solutions is to be a good looper or to hide? 
---
PS4 has been since 2.6, they lowered graphics but increased FPS
---
I need no sympathy 
---
So your saying if you want to get to rank 1, and your about to die and depip, all you have to do is DC and it will let you keep your pips prior to starting that game?
---
Weird since the update only came out today and there was 0 mention of it anywhere on this sub. Maybe I should go ahead and send those screenshots into the devs since you wanna be a dick. Can you say perma ban Mr cheat to get 300 of every offering. Must be so sad being you and spending a full 2 weeks cheating the game.
---
Meg‚Äôs falling voices sound like they belong to another character, is that just me?

***"mY FucKinG uNcLe cO-cReAteD"***
---
The cathedral in the center seems to be loop city, at least for the slower killers. It might just be that I don't know the map well enough yet, but it seems like whenever a survivor goes in there that I have an incredibly hard time keeping up with them.
---
Honestly got to "increases Clown movement speed to 217%" and quit. 
---
His uncle is clearly above the Devs paygrade.
---
I like the idea but as a accessibility option.
---
Unfortunately BHVR don't do options.
---
Idk if this happens to anyone else, but on console my friends and I have been experiencing this bug/glitch sometimes where we will load into a game and see the name of the map in the bottom left corner for the ENTIRE game and then we will ONLY hear skill checks but not see the skill check or see a progress bar on anything (includes Gen progress, Healing, Searching Chests, Totems, etc). 
---
Smacking them with one would. Not half assedly dropping it onto them.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm sorry for being a bit rude, but nothing annoys me like calls for bogus balance changes, like someone who said survivors should have a perk for permanent +4% movement speed. Can you I magine that?
---
Oops dropped my power better pick it up
---
Yah this is a total lie! Waited 20 mins with my SWF group and the whole time it said &lt;1 minute, we gave up and went back to solo, found a game &lt;15secs &gt;:-(
---
People are focusing on their major problems with the rank system, which is justified. 
---
Other than that, the update is really good. 
---
Oh pray tell how it destroys the game I'd love to hear whatever reason you pull out of your ass
---
I want to go up against Legion so bad now. Haven't gotten into the game for awhile now so it's going to be a whole new world for me.
---
Well tbh I like playing against Legions, it‚Äôs challenging after all
---
Why must you do this?
---
Enduring doesn't reduce the stun time by 75%, it increases recovery by 75%, meaning you are stunned for ~58% of the normal stun time. You can see the math and detailed explanation for it [on the wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Enduring).
---
not at all, its actually worse than that, the survivors will find eachother quicker and easier in the start with this perk, promoting gen-rushing
---
Libtard?
---
Sigh....there's no helping some people man.  Continue playing the victim mentality but it'll continue costing you games.  How am I winning almost all my games at top rank with worst killers in game if the game is so horrifically unbalanced?  I obviously play some very good swf teams at that rank.  Again if you are doing 2 or 3 chases and finding the game to be over you are over committing to chases.  Force that pallet down, abandon chase, pressure the gens.  Eventually they lose their defenses and even the games where they pop a few gens before your first hook can be turned around and won in the end.  Don't commit to chases!  Force down a quick pallet and then only stay on them if you know you can down them quickly.  Otherwise pressure gens instead.  
---
I'm bad at the game as it is :( #sadkiller

That seems both fun and funny as fuck. This needs to be a custom game.
---
Thank you! I used a pint of fake blood in a spray bottle for the clothes, and then for the mask, I had some congealed stage blood that I put on. 
---
Also when off the hook she‚Äôs the size of the map. Just giant tarantula legs and MASSIVE body.
---
I actually can't play with chainsaw killers.  My daughter has a genetic disorder and has a nurse come overnight.  Her bed is in the main room downstairs so the nurse can easy get to everything she needs. From about 8pm to 11 my daughter is sleeping but the nurse isn't there yet.  I turn the volume way down and play, but chainsaws are still too loud.  If I use headphones I can't here my daughter so oh well.
---
You wait for them to grab the survivor off the hook, then grab that survivor. 
---
Killer wants multiple survivors on one gen. It's when they're on 4 different ones that's the problem.
---
I played 8 matches yesterday. 3 I was dropped at the load screen. 4 my teammates were dropped at the load screen and their SWF friend would just DC because of it. 
---
I had one legit match vs a rank 2 hag and I was the only one to escape out the hatch at 2 of 5 gens. 
---
Games pretty broken right now.
---
I'm p sure you can still force a killer to have a splinter but idk. I saw my friend get forced to play freddy a couple times and i feel like it was at most a few months ago but idk if it still is a thing or not lol.
---
"Unrelenting, Beast of Prey, Territorial, Devour Hope, Dance With Me, TOTH, Lightborn," all perks that aren't even in the game right now. Like, preffering 30% to 50% unrelenting is just wrong, I don't know how to even argue against that point. 
---
What should the killer do then? Chase the survivor right next to the gate so he avoid getting a kill all together? 
---
Lol just an outright dismissal of everything I said.  Like debating a wall.  I'm sure I don't play any good survivors.  I'm the only one at that rank that exclusively gets shitty survivors I suppose lol.  Too funny bro.  Keep blaming survivors for your losses but they are on you.  Even the ones against sweaty swf's.
---
so it fills faster while running?
---
an "option" that gives a clear advantage isnt exactly an option, but mandatory. you can't put something like that in a somewhat competitive game.
---
So clown is garbage because he get's genrushed, so no it would not make him ridiculous to play against, fellow redditor.

my matches weren't nearly as buggy as yours seemed to be, but it certainly was much worse than usual (and i regularly have issues, since i play on a laptop). it kind of sucks because outside of the crashes and DCs, the game feels like it's running way better for me than it ever used to, and i can actually get matches as a rank 20 killer for dailies now! i don't understand tbh.

game machine broke

won't be too fun

If you don't cleanse she doesn't really have an ability aside from keeping you in No Mither state.  Put on Resilience and just plow through gens.  Stop feeding her Corrupt Purge.  It's the only thing that makes her strong.

I waited 20 minutes for a lobby with the estimated wait time less than 1 minute. Uninstalled the game until they fix it.
---
Okie dokie muh salty fella
---
Being one hit, leaving blood trails, and moaning is not a consequence? It's funny that a lot of killers complained about self care until it got nerfed and called it a crutch. Now that survivors have abandoned it and take the risk of being healed at the end, it is "op". What do you even want?
---
situational... if there's 1-2 gens left, let me go to struggle
---
 Basically one sec your up next Your on the ground then your on hook then your dead
---
The Clown isn't getting Gen-rushed because he's slow, but because there isn't anything to his power that slows Gen progression. If you really have trouble with Clown but run perks that slow the game down. The Clown is fine as he is.
---
I was just congratulating you on the EPIC roast on that libtard bro :\ y so mean? This is why we need to get rid of libtarded surv mains they make us EPIC killer chads attack each other :(
---
#Whiterights 
---
It's not a clear advantage lol. It's something to help make the game more accessible to disabled ppl. 
---
Maybe you‚Äôre playing newb killers? Try to rank up to get past them. Campers won‚Äôt pip. Good killers are much more aggressive and patrol gens.
---
Do whatever makes you feel better. I don't care.
---
I don't play for pips, but I don't like 4king every game either, I'd like to reach a rank where it's an actual challenge to win for me, and rank 8 is just not cutting it right now. I'm stuck on rank 8 getting a 4k almost every game and it's just boring. So i would like to pip so i could actually be able to play with players on my level, even if it means higher wait times.
---
It‚Äôs one of those games that has an abnormal amount of bugs though
---
It came out yesterday stupid. Just because you're late doesn't mean anything.
---
Had a bug yesterday where a Spirit downed me and picked me up and my struggle bar wouldn't work and she couldn't hook me, and someone tried to pallet save me and it didn't work either, leading to an infinite carry.
---
Pallet dropping (to me at least) feels super delayed and sometimes I go into a pallet spamming space to drop it and it doesn't drop until a few seconds later (could just be bad ping idk).
---
My current survivor rank is 12 and I get matched with 2-3 red rank killers every day with all other survivors being around my rank as well.
---
Lol idk if you‚Äôre joking or not
---
I‚Äôm a butthole 
---
whats the BBC
---
Well sounds like a ride 
---
I don‚Äôt see anything. 
---
You don‚Äôt care because you don‚Äôt have a valid argument. You‚Äôre part of the trash tier toxic survivor group that expects a killer to play by every single arbitrary rule. This is gonna be a hard pill to swallow, but good killers don‚Äôt give a shit about your rules. I bet you‚Äôre also one of the survivors that screamed bloody murder when they nerfed DS.
---
Gates are wide open and the hook is surrounded by survivors? You: ‚ÄúGo stand in the corner baby killer. ‚Äú Go play any campaign game on easy mode if you want a free win.
---
No no no self care is great lmao. As a killer I love it when survivors self care. Thats 40 seconds of them off a gen. I never complained about self care, killers who are dumb did
---
50% is really powerful, though. The way to fix the perk meta isn‚Äôt to make bad perks too strong. 
---
Well... the lie is usually oposite for me.
---
Wait time: 43 minutes
---
*20 seconds later*

Yeah same man, it‚Äôs shitty on both killer and survivor. The amount of times I‚Äôve lost people and been downed because I didn‚Äôt notice the red glow is crazy.

How? I'ts a WHIFFED hit, and they are still losing frames after TAKING A PERK FOR IT. It's absolutly not overpowered.
---
Ah yes the good old days of trapper Billy and chainsaw myers. Truly what a time it was to be alive
---
&gt; Talking about an outright dissmissal
---
&gt; When I made my arguments you dismissed them by saying 'Sigh....there's no helping some people man. Continue playing the victim mentality but it'll continue costing you games.'
---
Lol
---
He seems like he's memeing. 
---
It has zero balance, as in 0. Hatch standoff, 3/4 of the game's content is invalid, nurse, pipping, matchmaking, lag bursts.
---
I guess that explains why I'm having quick matches. I haven't done SWF since the update
---
I can‚Äôt tell if the format is bad for comedic effect or not, either way it makes it funnier
---
I could possibly help out. But my game has been sooooo laggy playing survivor today
---
Actualy no.
---
**Normal killer:**
---
Hit 1: whipe
---
Hit 2: whipe + down
---
**Legion:**
---
Hit 1: no whipe (practicaly) and power refill.
---
Hit 2: Whipe
---
Hit 3: Whipe
---
Hit 4: Whipe + down
---
**Legion w/franks**
---
Hit 3: Whipe + down
---
intervention/ ruin/ unnerving presence/ distressing

---
Lets play a game
---
My problem with him is his ability to just rushdown anyone at anytime. If Frenzy could only be activated after hitting someone once and was the more of a finisher ability then I would understand it. But the fact that you rush to a survivor, hit them, and then still have Frenzy to continue the rush is a bit ridiculous. Too multi-dimensional.
---
Holy fuck, I turned up my volume instinctively because LF's chainsaw was a bit quiet and then I got Haddonfield intro'd.
---
These are really bad, and the fact you are so adamant that you are correct makes you come across as a pompous cunt. 
---
She a bad bitch you can‚Äôt kill her 
---
Nice how that one survivor got hatch without doing anything useful
---
He teabags at literally every pallet nonstop and sandbags other survivors intentionally, also only does insidious basement LF as killer.
---
Well, the new killer just got release soo that might be a reason
---
Nw dude
---
Other than the complete dogshit matchmaking it‚Äôs honestly not that bad.
---
If you get matched up with people that are at your rank then fun can definitely still be had. And having fun is the most important thing for me right now. 
---
At least this time it isn't because of the content. At least, not as far as I know
---
Does ooo work during phasing? I thought it only effected the husk.
---
except it is. its easier to see a thing pop up than to hear a specific sound among many. making the game more accessible sure is nice, but everyone would use this feature. 
---
i'm disabled too and i dont think the devs should change anything about the game for a minority
---
Really?
---
I‚Äôm getting the impression you haven‚Äôt played this game very long. Anybody who‚Äôs played can see these are trash ideas, and you ‚Äúwhere‚Äù as pompous in every single reply that had points , which is proof enough you are an idiot. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure in the early days it didn‚Äôt. Could be wrong though. 
---
The entity is trippin 
---
* Wiggle wiggle wiggle* 
---
I like to think that when a survivor Tbags its them saying "if i get caught, you can do what ever you want with me" 
---
im sorry next meme will be more gender equal okay
---
Happened to me yesterday and none of my friends could see it happen until they spectated
---
Yeah it used to be it lasted about 2 minutes after the last gen was done 
---
My last Wraith match would have ended with a hatch escape.... If the survivors had cleared all of my totems. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
I've been stuck at rank 7 since the update, so I understand the pain. Though because of the mix of ranks, I've had a mix of depips, black pips, and +1 pips. So far, I've only gotten one +2 pips and that's because some chump was saboing my hooks to I had to end him quickly.
---
Nah thats freddy when were not asleep lmao 
---
It has counterplay now (dont tunnel, or slug the guy you just downed until 60 secs)
---
Its too short now. Its now even shorter than old tier 1 DS was with tier 3 enduring.
---
"The Plah-Guh" - no0b3
---
You're totally correct. If someone is calling you a clown for this, then it's because they probably just got taken down by NOED. 
---
I feel people should just stop taking the game so seriously, you could lobby jump and avoid bad ping. You could also get a green ping and end up losing. It's a game, get over it. I have bad internet but I payed just like everyone else and I'm not going to avoid playing half the game because your going to be a baby. It's not okay to demand someone upgrade their internet or stop playing, shit costs money and demanding they spend money on it to improve your gaming experience is self-centered and rude. 
---
I would camp them too probably. 
---
Not that you COULD be wrong about camping. Camping is not fun to do or play against but a killer is free to use whatever goddamn method he sees fit.
---
i got tunneled the entire game by a billy, Me and my friends all escaped 
---
Sounds ableist but ok.
---
The idea is not to see her in phasing. But since Prayer Beads effect is to remove phasing while you are outside her husk's radius, you'll see when she starts phase walking, not giving her any chance to gen grab you.
---
The only really team wide effectiveness against Prayer Beads is a full team of SWF with one person running Object of Obsession telling everyone when she is phasing, removing her ability to gen grab.
---
Please just stop always complaining about Legion, you're like the 100th post about it and it's not gonna end either, i would like to see other dbd memes, cauz now that's painfully annoying.
---
I don't care what your impression is, shitter. I dare you to try and rub your brain cells enough to list a single (one) valid point, otherwise i'm not replying to you again. 
---
People dont like him because he finds you for free, so you cant hide to delay/extend the beginning of a chase, and because of deep wounds/fast vaulting/moonwalking theres a fixed limit to how long you can extend the end of a chase. 
---
To say there's *zero* counterplay is a bit of hyperbole, but much like Nurse, Legion just throws all the mechanics of the game out the window. 
---
Guess I just don't miss much otherwise :P
---
I think that would be a good idea to be honest. And if they take some time off from new content, they could actually also keep the community busy with some smaller quality of life changes like balancing a few underused perks (left behined, this is not happening and I'd personally like to see a specific change to No Mither) but something I really want to see is the removal of slightly/moderately/considerably/tremendously and instead place concrete values
---
Not bad, nothing 2 impressive but im glad ur not just another p3 claud juking a new killer while running DS and Dead hard 
---
What is tunneling though?
---
Clown at 117% movement speed LULW. Just git gud at the game baby killer ez
---
It's a meme chill 
---
New ds is nasty , i prefer this one because Killer cant abuse the drop mechanic now 
---
Corrupt Intervention is an awful perk and complete waste of a slot. Id rather see it as a default mechanic for the game. 
---
My motivation to play killer died when survivors concistently managed to jump trough blocked windows
---
It is the counter tho
---
Nope, you can't grab survivors except during Gens, hatch, in a locker, or when you are vaulting while injured.
---
Lockers now hide survivor auras and also aura-blind the survivor
---
Good to know.
---
Still not amuzing. I like Legion, and i promote fair play and fun in game, and these kind of post encourage hatred against a selected part of the players, wich i find harassing
---
Even further back than that it just never wore off 
---
Knowledge is power!
---
Legion is higher and Trapper is lower because he is easy to counter.
---
You may wanna check my post history. I've got you covered on that Five-gum thing.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main but I‚Äôm much better as a survivor, I‚Äôve always been really good at games that require stealth. I suck ass at being the killer but it‚Äôs more fun for me so I just slog through it in the low ranks haha
---
I know you‚Äôre joking, but please stop.
---
Glad to hear a not bad at least! I‚Äôm still very much in the learning stage with editing :)
---
Rip this post, and to answer it.... I haven‚Äôt seen one, but that seems very obnoxious. Against a 4 SWF (assuming they‚Äôre all good at the game) you‚Äôll never kill all 4 if they‚Äôre tryharding anyways. 
---
The video should come after the ‚Äùhow it feels to chew 5 gum‚Äù and ‚Äùstimulate your senses‚Äù after the video
---
Dbd is becoming so gosh darn broken XD 
---
&gt;Am I wrong for camping someone like that Claudette?
---
You paid for your game, do whatever you want. 
---
Personally, I find it hilarious that people get this triggered over TBagging. Maybe is because I played this game for way too many hours to the point where nothing annoys me anymore but still. 
---
I love that idea for consoles but it won‚Äôt help deaf/hard of hearing PC gamers.
---
Lol I'm bad but you have to camp for kills ? The logic
---
Dbd is breaking, it knows this, and is making itself worse
---
On PS4: Me and two friends will join a SWF lobby, when we find a game, only the host will be sent to the game lobby with 3 other strangers while me and the other friend will be stuck in a loading screen until we disconnect from our original friend. 
---
I only have a bean to flick...
---
Templates suck. Couldn't find one.
---
You‚Äôre a mad man. 
---
u/IIDsrXideII looks like you got a winner lol
---
Trapper needs to be lower, Plague needs to be lower, Hag needs to be a bit higher, Spirit needs to be a bit lower. I would talk about Freddy but I cant be arsed at this point
---
Meanwhile I have to wait 4 minutes as a killer just to get a lobby.
---
Hey, me too. Any word on why this is happening because we have spent an hour in lobbies and played one game
---
That's rough buddy
---
Creepy meme.
---
Truly Wholesome
---
I‚Äôd be fine with 40%.
---
When i got the game and started playing solo survivor, a lot of games in which the killer camped, the killer won. You'd be surprised by how effective camping is when your team mates aren't that bright.
---
Calm your tits
---
I'm a decent survivor, I'm stuck in green ranks because I have no input in wether I'll pip or not. Getting tunneled? No pip. Killer refusing to chase you? No pip. Ebony mori? No pip. And often, those things cause a depip.
---
Idk how everyone else feels about t-bagging but I feel like it's a laugh in the face. Like "Haha, I stunned you, you suck haha!" Something along those lines. Honestly if someone was to do something like that irl I'd prolly throat punch em then laugh myself lol. Idk lol, maybe I'm just a wierdo.
---
dwight or meg 
---
I just bought it yesterday on Steam lmao
---
I mean, it'd be bad at 75% unless i'm missing something, does it reduce chainsaw whiff cooldown or something?  At 50% it would still one of the worst perks in the game that nobody would ever take. 
---
Kate. Just because of the bloody kneecaps ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Everything the killer has is just placeholder code for some component of survivor aspect.
---
lol imagine taking a Christmas break and coming back to this train wreck. 
---
Yes but his breathing is SO LOUD
---
don‚Äôt we all
---
Ouch... That's sad to look at
---
Not constructive. I see what kind of guy you are
---
I've actually never thought about this I'm excited to see an answer lol
---
Im actually an old killer main. They wrecked my boy trapper so I dont enjoy playing him anymore, but I like Pig and spirit is ok for me. I just dumped tons of BP into legion when he came out over other killers because he felt fun, but then everyone was like "this is the worst thing to happen to the game ever" so I don't play him much anymore, and I usually just level my survivors now since I mostly play survivor.
---
Lol I'm sorry
---
You're right but Freddy deserves His rework first
---
Honestly, I've seen 10,000 tier lists
---
I guess
---
You ever hear of R33mix from TF2 way back in the day?
---
I want to make stuff like his. This is only the beginning (probably)
---
Just anecdotally it feels that way. I'm a big fan of going to any map that isn't the bland 3 (MacMillan, Coldwind, Autohaven) even on survivor and nearly any time someone burns those ones it takes priority.
---
I'm pretty sure its fairly balanced. If 2 map offerings are put into the game, the game has a 50/50 chance of picking either one of the maps. 
---
the only benefit survivors have is that they can place more than one of the same map offering. In that case, if 2 Coldwin offerings go against 1 lerys offering, you have a 33% chance of getting a lerys map from my understanding.
---
It must be just bad luck for you. I'm surprised you are finding survivors that bother to use map offerings as I rarely have any used against me as killer.
---
No idea, but it only started happening after the plague update. It sucks to wait more than 10-15 minutes at a time only to have to start all over again. 
---
Tapp tools cool
---
It‚Äôs about being an immersed Claudette, not optimal play 
---
Some of these are great, some are completely awful. 
---
You must think that just because things have been worse before, which they definitely have, means no one is allowed to complain now because you had it so much worse before. 
---
Gotcha, title was confusing
---
Honestly I think just the 5 gum talking over the clip would have been best
---
Well that's a pretty split poll. 
---
I think's "not good" but that's probably the dust settling from the changes this patch. Just feels like everyone's on edge about the pipping thing- you can feel it during the matches.
---
Yea I think as killer you‚Äôre so used to the standard scratch marks that lightweight can kind of fuck with you sometimes. It‚Äôs the same reason I don‚Äôt ever run predator. Lightweight still could use some sort of minor buff tho because it‚Äôs still useless like 95% of the time. 
---
Survivors. 
---
In 99% of situations. 
---
Tired of seeing tier lists, but this one is better than most I‚Äôve seen so whatever
---
I‚Äôm so glad the suspense built up to that
---
I don‚Äôt level up survivors anymore because I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyeah whatever perks I have work‚Äù. Very few are actually worth a damn
---
He also DDoS‚Äôd someone because they got stuck in a locker 
---
Add me on Xbox- Godfather5040 
---
A variation of, ‚ÄúI know you are but what am I‚Äù. You haven‚Äôt offered one drop of reasonable logic in your entire conversation. It doesn‚Äôt surprise me you go off on tangents.
---
Enjoy my ignore list.
---
Yeah. This happened to me earlier too. I got hit and she wasn't even facing me one time, and another time I was way out of range. But both landed magically. 
---
My issue with this is; 
---
As a survivor, the game becomes incredibly difficult. I rely deeply on the other survivors to both loop the killer efficiently while also not suiciding on hook. You also gain less bp overall through reduced altruistic opportunities.
---
As killer; 
---
Farming with a 2 man is nice and all but its time consuming and can get really annoying as it forces you as a killer to depip. Great for survivors to gain some bp but they also have the fun ruined for them by removing the chase aspect of the game.
---
Having a 3 man becomes so easy that I feel bad if I don't allow the survivors to live and farm. Most survivors tend to just kill themselves on hooks or worse DC during a 3 man leaving me without points. Especially annoying If I run BBQ and survivors leave before I can hook them.
---
Unpopular opinion: It's a sensory game, sorry
---
People suicide on their first hook? Wow! I've never seen them get that far, they usually disconnect when they get downed!
---
Are you being serious right now? Lol especially with the new ranking system, you just want killers to give you the hatch? Lol
---
always 10x more 
---
HAHA fun. HAHA pube meme.
---
HAHA sarcasm.
---
Well don't guess. If you had the option to reduce stuns by 75%, have a hex that disables gen doubling basically, a perk that exposes survivors when they unhook, why would you take even 50% whiff reduction? 
---
elaborate
---
The way you worded that it doesn't sound like you were just surviving with friends.
---
With the new ranking system I wouldn‚Äôt take playing too seriously. I honestly am just trying to play and have fun now with the yellow rank potatoes cause I‚Äôve given up on ranking up lmao. 
---
Eh, I enjoy these. Always good for discussion
---
naughty naughty
---
( here come the downvotes ) i find pipping as survivor is much more difficult than killer. But like i said, I dislike when survivors expect the hatch. I understand why this killer didn‚Äôt give it to me. But it sucks when you do so much work for no reward. I personally feel I deserved the hatch in this game, but I‚Äôm not upset that I didn‚Äôt get it. 
---
I was being optimistic... [They're usually gone before we even start](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aqzbls/day_7_disappointed_dwight/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Right? I recently played a game where my ping was in the constant 60-80 range, and the survivors had close to 200 each. After the match they messaged and said that they reported me for lagswitching. I hate people like that who dont even consider whether the problem was because of them. (I'm still convinced that they were only angry because I downed the last dude after he almost got a flashlight save.)
---
Honestly, the only issue I've had on console from this patch is the rank system for survivors specifically. It has basically forced me to bully low rank survivors because I'm not good enough to break out of rank 11 when I used to hit around rank 4 each time. Matchmaking has been infinitely better for my friends and I though. We haven't waited thirty minutes for a lobby since the patch. 
---
I like to do it to empty lockers just to see if they check. My sick pranks get me killed 90% of the time but still worth.
---
If you are talking about number tiers, you could be referring to perk tiers. Every perk has 3 tiers with tier 3 being the strongest and tier 1 being the weakest. The perk has effects improved or added on as the perk tier increases. They can be found by leveling them up through the blood web.
---
If you are talking about evil within tiers, that's "The Shape's" power. 
---
When he stalks survivors, his power tiers up making him stronger.
---
 
---
Tier 1 for the shape makes his terror radius very small but makes him have little to no speed. 
---
Tier 2 makes him like any normal killer except with a smaller than average terror radius. 
---
Tier 3 allows him to instantly down survivors with his attack but only lasts for a short period of time before being reset to tier 2. 
---
It just comes from personal opinion. Theres some parts of the tier list where they are guarenteed to be (E.G Nurse should always be at the top) but the rest is down to opinion.
---
The yellow rank potatoes need guidance, good hair Megan. Pls show them the altruistic, gen-doing, urban evading ways. How else will they grow?!
---
I‚Äôm getting pip as killer every game, I don‚Äôt find it that difficult, but as survivor, you basically need to have a great to pip once. I got gold in all categories a game ago and I barely got 1 pip. 
---
Its called overbuffing killer
---
Oh I‚Äôm a potato too just less potato. I‚Äôm always a team player though. :)

Awwww np &lt;3 editing is really difficult and I understand that on a spiritual level. You will get better at it! Believe in urself man :D
---
Dwight, Claudette, Jake, and Kates 
---
Agreed
---
My dream is for this to be added
---
But knowing BHVR they‚Äôd add that one main bitch from the prequel instead (blegh) 
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty freakin hot 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty discouraging and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll inspire new players to put a lot of time into the game but we will see I guess. 
---
Why is he toxic? What is he doing that is bad?
---
I am playing something else lmao. The game used to be good but now it's not. How long have we had the infinite loading screen now? How long have we been waiting on a Freddy rework? I agree cosmetics are useless but people still buy them because if they didn't then there wouldn't be so goddamn many. There are more cosmetics than decent things in the game. You seem to suck the devs assholes with how much you worship them. How about you grow a backbone and a pair of eyes to go along with it. 
---
It‚Äôs up to the killer to give up the hatch, don‚Äôt complain if they don‚Äôt want to give it up.
---
you know your sarcastic comment is great when you have to explain that its sarcasm in the same comment. gj dude proud of ya
---
Why this look like a really different version of noob3
---
Yep. 
---
P3 Tapp gang 
---
Amazing! 
---
Why on earth do you run an endgame build on the clown. 
---
No , the good old days was Myers heading floating around with no body , with his knife floating right right in before of him, with a soundless enviable hillbilly chainsaw power.   Another was killers and survivors able to use each other's perks or multiple copies of the same work . So killers with bond or empathy , or stacking like 4 thanatophia for like a 96% reduction.  Or 2 save the Best for last and 2 unrelenting for zero cooldown on missed and successful attacks.  
---
No karma is safe here. Not even in shitpost threads.
---
I understand that &amp; I agree but when you do ALL the work and get no reward for it, it‚Äôs a bit discouraging. I literally turned off my PS4 rn, bcuz what‚Äôs the point of playing if you get no progress? I‚Äôm finding it extremely difficult to pip. You have to get at least gold in all categories to BARELY pip. 
---
I'm chill. But your like explaining how memes personally attack you. 
---
Nah
---
Cause fuck my life. Actually its the only build i have on him at the moment prestiged him
---
I play both, get salty as a killer then laugh as I get consistent escapes on survivor. It‚Äôs really not difficult. And that‚Äôs without abusing any sort of loop, just some stealth and knowing where I can run to.
---
I don't know why, but this sounds like a fun side gamemode
---
I once had a Spirit afk a few minutes into a match, right after hooking someone. At first we thought she was faking a phase walk to bait us, then we assumed she was hard facecamping, so we just left the Claudette to die on hook. It took about 3 gens uncontested to realize she was completely afk.
---
Being the smartass that I am, at the end of the match I opened the door next to her and started running in circles to farm Boldness off her. I did that for about 3 minutes before she suddenly phased and lunged at me out of no where. Scared the shit out of me. The guy just sat back at his computer and saw I was messing around so he thought he'd give me a scare.
---
Killer perk: edible?
---
All players including killer who are under the age of 8 immediately begin choking. 
---
Definitely We‚Äôll Make It. You can always combine that with Botany Knowledge if you wish.
---
Aftercare is also a nice addition to a rescue build.
---
Looks nice. It seems that Jane just got her favorite outfit ruined when Adiris vomited on her.
---
###If you could stop suiciding on your first hook, that would be great
---
constantly getting those 300ms ping killers is annoying. it takes longer to find games and the ping is worse than before... meh. i dont know what they changed about how its decided which killers you get, but it has to be reverted or tweaked.
---
Yea. The last statement you said. How do they come up with those tiers? My Freddy and Legion both would be tier 1 because they're the only ones I consistently mow pwople down with. Whereas the others... not so much. 
---
*sigh*
---
Farming games are okay for a bit but after a while of having all the pallets slammed down on your head and trying to remember which person is on death hook is so difficult sometimes... When I do play and there‚Äôs an early dc or 3/2 person game it makes me less likely to play another as it‚Äôs not fun to either farm or die on first hook 
---
But killers need 4k to pip too. They obviously deserve the the pip as well. What makes your hard work more important than theirs? Because in your opinion it's easier to play killer?
---
Well then you should be asking the devs for the hatch, or alternatively a game that has a fair ranking system. As a killer main i wouldnt give you the hatch unless your teammates screwed you over and you played really well, assuming i already pippped myself. But i understand your frustration on the emblems systems and ranking in general. 
---
Yes dbd stop people with free will from dcing 
---
2 new killers were added. Legion and the Plague. 
---
Legion is widely recognised as the worst killer in the whole of DBD. Both mechanically &amp; playability. His power is uncounterable due to his ability to vault pallets and windows at the same speed as a fast vault yet he is a really weak killer without add-ons due to his power being inefficient at downing survivors &amp; his base 110% movement speed. He has an Add-on that basically allows him to down survivors within 15 seconds of being chased without counterplay which breaks the whole game.
---
Plague is the most recent killer. People generally like her due to her power being interesting and giving us a new ranged killer that is basically a hybrid huntress. She has the 115% movement speed while having the option to use ranged with her corrupt vomit. Good killer with good perks. 
---
New survivors are allright. 
---
Jeff brings in stealth &amp; a team aura perk that trumps the other arua perks. His stealth perk soft counters BBQ and other aura based perks making it relatively popular. Breakdown is more of a meme, breaking the hook you were saved from but being able to see the killer for 6 seconds after being saved is useful.
---
Jane perks are a meme. One hides scratch marks after a gen is done making it only decent for gen jockey builds.
---
Head on is a terrible exhaustion perk that stuns killers when rushing out a locker for 3 seconds. Very bad and hard to pull off.
---
Her healing perk allows her to heal 50% after healing another survivor. Not terrible but not particuarly good.
---
DS was changed to become an anti-tunnel perk. Pretty nice. 
---
Many perks like ruin &amp; BBQ were improved for lower tiers meaning tier 3 is not mandatory for its full effect
---
Totem spawning improved to stop survivors spawning on top of totems. They still can spawn next to gens which sucks. 
---
Matchmaking changed so that survivors are picked in groups of 4 then depositied into lobbies. Has generally resulted in survivors with poor pings &amp; slightly longer lobby waiting times.
---
Ranking changes have made ranking really difficult. Designed to make the game last longer meaning if you do too well like slug 4 surivivors in the beginning of the match to instantly win you can depip. 
---
Hiding in lockers blocks you from any aura detection but also gives you the blindness status effect. 
---
Pallet count minimum increased to 8.
---
Not to sound rude, but here's something to help. Tight turns are your friend.
---
The only issue is the makers didnt pay the maker of Jason a lot of money (and the DBD devs have a lot of money with franchise like Halloween, Nightmare on elm street and Texas chainsaw massacre to  name a few) and soon the evil dead 
---
haHAA wow hilarious haHAA
---
Using pallets and windows is also an exploit. Don't you know the survivors are supposed to run in a straight line until the killer downs them?
---
I got hooked in the basement. Soon after one of my teammates gets downed and the killer picks them up and starts bringing them to the basement. I kobe and reach the stairs and I get a flashlight save while the killer is walking down them.
---
RUN SCOTT
---
By all means no, I find killer much more difficult to play. Whenever I wanna ‚Äú relax ‚Äú i play survivor. But im saying that the ranking system only rewards either the killer or the survivors. Not both. So even though, i did my part plus more, &amp; the killer did his part, only the killer was rewarded. My whole problem with this game now, is the ranking system. There‚Äôs no in-the-middle reward system. And thats lame. I want both parties to have fun and be rewarded ( if they deserve it ) 
---
What you all dont know is that I have a humiliation kink
---
I don't think I've made it to &lt;1 before 
---
Can the killer cross the map quickly or hit people from a distance? A to S tier. Everyone else? Meh to garbage. 
---
I wouldn't say Claudette, no one sees her once the match starts to it's hard to say.
---
I played the game in beta. You want to talk about an interesting experience.
---
I always wished that survivors could take killer perks and killers take survivor perks and it turns out that thats something that was actually in the game for a while. Not only that, but I just found out that survivors could take killer powers AND killers could take each others powers
---
That was pretty funny. The look on nea‚Äôs face during the animation and the distance to the exit haha ‚ÄúAHH ITS RIGHT THERE!‚Äù
---
by symbols i mean shit like ‚ô°

Just started playing again a few days ago after a 6 month break. Even when I did play I played relatively casually but I knew there were ranks. What exactly did they do to ranks? I‚Äôm only rank 14 but I see the deranking occurring a lot. For example I‚Äôll have 2 good games and then 1 where by team gets slaughtered and then I‚Äôm back at square 1 of rank 14. Also how does level deranking work? Like at what point can you go from 14 back to 15?
---
Well, I think your opinion makes no sense.
---
I run Diversion (pebble) and am often notified by that perk that I‚Äôm within terror radius just because it starts winding down (as can Stake Out). So what does it matter if people had an indicator in the bottom corner (day, a pulsing heart that beats faster) as the Killer gets closer?
---
And if you still think the reliance on sound is crucial, then why not add it as an ‚ÄòAccessibility‚Äô option in the menu, where if it‚Äôs enabled it will disable all sound. (Meaning that only those who are deaf get any benefit from it.)
---
its usually based on players personal expeirence with the killer but there is some truth to the tier list. 
---
Generally, killers who have a higher tier require more skill to use but can end chases quicker than killers at the bottom of the tier list. 
---
For example, Huntress can be really hard to play with but people who have played with her can end chases before they even start. These killers tend to have a power that is really difficult to counter or have traits that make them very difficult to fight against. For example, Nurse can teleport through pallets, meaning normal pallet looping doesnt work with her.
---
Lower tier killers tend to be killers with a lower skill ceiling but deal with extended chases. 
---
For example, Legions power allows him to injure people but after that, he has to rely on his 110% movement speed to chase survivors. If survivors know how to play against Legion they can easily decimate him by forcing him to chase them around pallet loops with 110% movement speed.
---
I prefer to play with a controller 
---
Ah I see. So Ps4 is doing pretty well but Pc is having terrible time. That sucks!
---
Thank you. 
---
This sounds like an option I'd like in kill your friends
---
Thanks bruh
---
you just made me think of 2x (actual non-huntress) machine gun build 
---
that'd be horrible
---
Actually sounds like fun, but I can imagine it getting boring quickly
---
Of course, anything for a stranger on the internet. :)
---
Small Game completely trivializes it too. It would take the entire team less than half a gen's worth of time to do all 5 if people actually cleansed totems. I've never seen such a weird attitude towards a mechanic in a game from its community. "I'm never going to wear a condom ornuse birth contr but I'm also going to get irrationally upset when I have children."  
---
Forcing survivors onto 4 gens that are close together is what this perk is *supposed* to do. It's really easy to patrol 4 gens that are specifically close to each other, so this perk is *supposed* to ensure that the killer finds somebody in the first 2 minutes.
---
The counterplay is just not to go to those 4 gens, wait it out, then they have a dead perk slot. 
---
I've used it a lot, and it's at its most effective when the survivors decide they need to get on a gen ASAP and run straight into me.
---
Not in DbD I assume?
---
That makes me feel really worthless but I‚Äôm still gonna take it as a complimentüòÇ
---
B-but
---
Internet strangers are special. :(
---
Now you can play Bill and sacrifice yourself to allow your team to escape. All his perks are based around that aspect of his character though. 
---
Borrowed time is to counter camping killers &amp; expose him at the safety of the survivor he unhooked. 
---
Unbreakable provides him with a last resort ability to pick himself back up &amp; possible even save other slugged teammates. 
---
Left behind allows him to try &amp; complete the task in dire situations where everyone has died. 
---
Though it's quite nice to see an L4D reference in a game considering how old that game series is now.
---
Well it‚Äôs based on ‚Äúpips‚Äù and different color ranks have a different number of pips you need to rank up so like rank 14 you need 4 pips to get to rank 13. You get pips by performing well in the different emblem categories (objective, boldness, survival, and altruism). You can get 1 pip, 2 pips, safety pip, or lose a pip in each game (or lose 2 pips if you leave the match). Basically they made it harder to pip up or even safety pip which is where you get 0 pips but you don‚Äôt lose any. I‚Äôve had games where I do two gens myself, unhook teammates, have long chases, etc and only safety pip or depip. I‚Äôm not quite sure the requirements for pipping up now but from what I‚Äôve experienced playing so far it‚Äôs hard as shit. 
---
When something only happens occasionally then it's far more standable than when you get it so often its rare the killer doesnt run it. NOED having the same effects at all 3 tiers and not being a teachable perk means that if you get it at tier 1 you won't bother with any other perks or builds because 'oh I've just got NOED I don't have anything better so I might as well use it'. 
---
New players don't bother with finding different builds to use because they get such a powerful perk for free. They then get more experienced but still holding onto NOED because they're too accustomed to having it as their little backup plan instead of facing their failure due to their mistakes throughout the match. These players will never learn because they managed to get tier 1 NOED and can't live without it. These are also probably the players who whine and complain about OP survivor mains when they don't get more than 2 kills.
---
And solos cannot work together in the same way that SWF teams can because they don't know what the other people are doing at all times. They don't know if other survivors are cleansing totems. They don't know if another survivor is going for the save. They don't know if someone is working on the last gen. And they certainly don't know if they should bodyblock because someone is about to wiggle out. There's such a big difference between solo and SWF and if killers are balanced around one then the other will be at a huge advantage or a huge disadvantage. In the state the game is in now it's the solos at a disadvantage and its just not fair.
---
As for the perks: the exhaustion nerf was definitely needed and the pallet vacuum removal was the same, Borrowed Time made sense to be changed but I highly disagree with the way they changed DS. It is practically useless now and should not have been so drastically changed with NOED to be untouched. There's just one survivor nerf that really should not have been so harsh and that is the pallet distribution. When there are only 10 pallets on a map, 1 of which being the shack pallet and 5 of which being unsafe it's just too easy for killers to win chases. As it stands killers are far too powerful for the game to be considered 'balanced'. The escape rate for survivors is far too low and solo teams don't really stand a chance. 
---
I completely agreeüòÇ so Its definitely a compliment nowüòÇ
---
Big yikes. 
---
"How many times do we need to teach you this lesson, old man?"
---
That‚Äôs just not cool to spam message someone like that 
---
Dunno about you but for now wasn't a lie for me.
---
If all fountains are corrupt then they all reset to their clean state meaning she cannot really supress survivor access to the fountain unless she proxy camps it. In that situation treat it like she is camping a hook and do gens. 
---
The vomit until broken is strong but comparing it to hillbilly or cannibal its not that strong. you still need to expose yourself to her long enough for her to break you. 
---
Even then people still rate her mid-tier due to being susceptible to looping &amp; how vomit is hard to control. She also lacks map pressure like any other M1 killer.
---
The whipe isn't the issue. Keeping in mind that between every hit the Legion moves at like 130% speed with vaulting capability making the chase trivial unless you're the worst killer player in the world is part of the bigger problem as a whole.
---
I preferred Coach, and I‚Äôd love it if they had added him in place of Bill way back when that decision was made or if they added him in as well as Bill now.  I‚Äôm not a huge fan of overloading the game with licensed characters, but since they‚Äôve stuck to unlicensed original characters do not steal for the last few chapters, I don‚Äôt really have much of a problem with the existing number of guests or if they made another guest chapter later (which it looks like they‚Äôre going to).
---
Good job on the kill! But man I do not like Rancor very much at all. 
---
Haven't played as survivor yet, but I've had a few double pip killer games.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs bugged because I dced as killer on ps4 to test this out and I lost two pips
---
Yea I agree with ya. You dont deserve the hatch. The killer is trying to rank up too and offset the hit from the DC.
---
I tought im getting better at killer.
---
I noticed that i learned how to abuse the vault hitbox animation.
---
True about map pressure, but this rant is mostly due to me spawning literally 20 metres away from her, getting found and destroyed in an open area from her vomit.
---
I‚Äôm assuming this just happened, try a rank 10 P3 lvl 50 Nurse with BBQ, Nurse‚Äôs calling, and 2 suicides.  I can‚Äôt even blame them!
---
Hex : Devour dough
---
Yup, I'm mostly deaf and I cannot track the direction of sound for shit.
---
Legion removes all skill from chases, which is cancer if you‚Äôre good at chases 
---
That I agree with. The broke the ranking system. 
---
Btw I had a bug where i played with one of my friends as survivor.
---
In the lobby on the left it showed a knife icon. Like he was playing killer.
---
We joined a lobby to see what would happen and the team was full with 4 survivors but it only showed 3 and 1 was invisible.
---
I was hyped for a 2 killer game bug :/ But at game start we all got a dc and we lost all the items and addons+offerings.
---
Honestly? I can't blame them either. I got put against a Legion with garbage internet today and lets just say the only reason I didn't DC was because of bloodpoints. 
---
The game is MUCH SMOOTHER! (PS4) 
---
Jesus fucking Christ
---
Oh yeah, it used to only be like 20% but base crouch speed was slower anyway. 4 sprint burst was still interesting though as well as 4 of the old version of STBFL.
---
[**I saw this similar here**](http://pizza.ghorard.club)
---

---
No, that was a nerf the devs were considering, but they never went through with. Believe me, I can see survivors as soon as they leave my terror radius.
---
Legion LOL
---
This is truly unpopular. 
---
Plague is not great. She needs green add ons or you‚Äôll be puking on them forever. 
---
I haven't played Legion in so long that last night, after being boolied, I decided to throw on the ole Mixtape and Cold Dirt with a happy little Mori to get vengeance. I had to shower afterwards. 
---
True, but she can only do it if she ctahes you of guard, she is very easy to loop as her power doesn't really help unless she has Corrupt Purge.
---
Your 4th &amp; 5th link are the same\~
---
The distraction and protection events have always been broken
---
Tunneling legion confirmed
---
Thanks for the response. So essentially they made pip requirements higher for survivors in the update? Also how does this compare to the killer pips? Is it like 1 kill gets you a pip/safety and if so does this explain why some idiots facecamp their first hook?
---
Why does everyone always pick the nurse... but never play her if she's so good?
---
Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
---
It‚Äôs just as annoying as self care really. 
---
Gotta do what you gotta do. 
---
You ever use 0 terror radius Freddy build?
---
nah at the time urban was only 15% faster crouching. 15 x 4 = 60 so it was actually slower than what it currently is 
---
My thoughts exactly lmao
---
I may have missed it, but is there something to compensate for your wglf proposed nerf in terms of bp? 2 stacks is just...horrible in light of survivor bp gain. Also, the movement speed when hit is admittedly creative, but seems kind of underwhelming. 
---
I will say the dyling light suggestion isn't too bad though and even a slighter higher number wouldn't be oppressive.
---
I am genuinely curious why this decision of changing ranking system so drastically was made in the first place. Just a straight honest answer from the dev team with an explanation of the change. In no way I feel entitled for the answer, this is pure curiousity. 
---
what i don't get though is it is working perfectly on tier 2 but tier 3 i literally haven't got a single stack of protection
---
Should‚Äôve added a chainsaw sound tho
---
I see. This all makes better sense now. 
---
I doubt anyone willingly DC's while loading for a match
---
And? I still got a 3K with 4 gens left and finished the match in less than 7 minutes. I deserve to pip up.
---
This is why I don't like videogames, they appeal to the male fantasies
---
Well I would if every patch they didn't keep changing the spawns so you can find 4/5 and you'll never find the 5th
---
What does playing a specific character have anything to do with perks?
---
Honestly not sure about killer. I only play killer to give people easy wins after I‚Äôve had very infuriating survivor matches. They did make killer pips harder too but I think it‚Äôs a little easier than survivor from what I‚Äôve read/heard streamers say. They do need more sacrifices but I think they‚Äôd probably get less out of a 1st hook kill. Probably would get more out of 2nd and 3rd hook kills so idk why people facecamp tbh. 
---
It's so you can rationalize taking it every game, really.
---
Not when you get a silver chaser with legion. You‚Äôre either camping or using Frank‚Äôs mixtape if you somehow get a silver with a character who doesn‚Äôt lose chases. 
---
Either way, a pip is undeserved. 
---
Plenty of people do
---
Oh no that is what I‚Äôm talking about.  2x Unrelenting (when unrelenting reduced successful hits as well as unsuccessful hits) and 2x Play With Your Food.
---
The dogs cosplay came out great
---
Once or twice, in KYF. The movement speed reduction from Red Paint Brush makes it unviable for me in ranked gameplay. 
---
Its boring that's for sure.
---
Thank you! I fixed it. :p
---
https://i.imgur.com/RUh27wo.jpg
---
I wasn't camping or using franks. Like I said, I finished the game in less than seven minutes and downed people extremely quick by letting them bleed out while moving backwards.
---
The majority of non-teachable perks are useless: NOLF, Slippery Meat, Hope, Unrelenting, Iron Grasp...
---
Fucking Iibtard wanna go fuck head dumb dumbass dumb boy faglibtarderal üò°
---
Why do you feel the need to rank up? There are no rewards and no statistics post season. 
---
Its a joke :)
---
? Clarify 
---
I'm not a great killer, but I like playing killer.
---
If I dont run it, I lose two gems right as i hook someone. If i run it, it slows the game down to the point that i can try to hook/kill at least a few survivors. 
---
Game just ends too fast without it.
---
Oh lol
---
The wraith and the doctor.
---
Yeah that period was real fun! Not funnier than that other period where you could get infinite loading screens in which you would have to close the game with the task manager. Oh wait, that still happens after YEARS!
---
Its like 5% chance you‚Äôll get it and decreases the time your hooked so less chance your teammates can unhook you

---
No one tries because you only have a 4% chance of escaping the hook
---
The change to escape is only 4% per try. 
---
On top of that, being on the hook is split into 2 phases: the part where you can escape and the part where you have to struggle. Atrempting an escape takes away 1/3 of your escape phase, so you just come closer to dying. Because the chance of escaping is so low, most people don't bother unless all people are down because it gives you more time
---
because it kills you faster and it's only a 4% chance that you actually escape the hook.
---
Cause when you attempt to unhook yourself you chip away at how long you can stay on the hook before dying, you get 2/3 tries then you're put into the struggle mode which if someone unhooked you you'll die the next time you're hooked versus if you don't try to unhook yourself you get 2 hooks before you have to struggle and on the third you die. People don't try to unhook themselves so they can stay in the game longer, people who do try are just there to give up
---
It speeds up the sacrifice drastically giving you less time to be saved
---
ofc noed shouldnt show up if he downs someone whos already injured.
---
Oh dude I didn‚Äôt even notice the different make up I really thought she had the same bun 5 times in the store.
---
If it ever got turned into one, I'd play it!
---
Ingame name checks out.
---
You're disgusting using legion, shame on you 
---
Ah, okay. Thank you and everyone else who responded for explaining why. 
---
u/siberlily
---
People here say 'opinion' but go as far as using made up statistics and fight to protect their dogmatism. 
---
Thanks for the detailed write up. Seems like a lot of perks changed. Time to read up on them again
---
When 2 offerings contradict eachother they cancel eachother,so it's mostly jist being really unlucky
---
Fountains are often really far away so it wastes a lot of time going for it in the first place so it's a tradeoff.
---
She's not by any means top tier but can be annoying on some maps.
---
There are already Survivor perks in the game that give you a visual indicator of when you're in the Killer's terror radius. 
---
Why isn‚Äôt Dwight in a closet?!
---
Looks amazing 
---
Well it's like game over if you don't use it at rank 1, well it's game over even if you use it lol
---
Frank's is definitely an insta-DC. 
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
Dwight's face though
---
Nea, Ace &amp; Kate
---
Used to be any offensive action would reveal the killer had NOED. Had a *facecamping* doctor get rewarded a 3K for us completing gens while he sat and camped/ did nothing to protect gens the whole match
---
If they don't get chased out, they don't have to leave. Sometimes, you'll down one on the way out, too, and that's more points.
---
You used to know if a Killer has NOED whenever they damage a Survivor; Chainsaw, Feral Frenzy, Hatchet Hits, and Basic Attacks that downed an injured Survivor would all notify every Survivor that NOED is in effect, even though NOED doesn't effect those attacks.
---
I don't know about this personally, but according to OP it now only shows NOED is active when a healthy Survivor is instantly downed.
---
I really like my P3 Quentin. Without blood he looks like a wimp but in P3 his vibe is more like 'I was a wimp but thousands of blood trials made me strong'. 
---
