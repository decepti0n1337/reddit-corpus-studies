Damn this is awesome. Would we be able to get an even more minimal version without the tally marks?

"Not so fun when you're the one being smacked with these, huh?"
---
Nearly dead ? 
---
I swear it's just the top tier killers too. I mean I suppose it's cause that's their only weaknesses is certain maps and layouts, but like ugh. With Huntress and Billy I'm just trying to get some sick saws and hatchets. Don't do this to me.
---
Struggling to feel you inside them?
---
*Crab Rave starts*
---
Aw that sounds like a sad life 
---
I didn't mean it to sound like they were greedy, I thought the cosmetics could be easier as a better way to incentivize getting people to buy Ace and Feng. If it's structured too strenuously then people will probably just say forget about it or one day regret all that effort they put in. 
---
Even without Prove Thyself, with three people on a generator each under the effect of two Leaders, a generator gets done in 22.2 seconds.
---
Great teamwork! 
---
"Bad" as in "weakest of all killers". As in comparing atom bomb to conventional artillery shell. Both are quite deadly but one is whole lot more powerful. Freddy is not entirely toothless, unironically, but it's pretty much as close as you can get to "impossible difficulty" as killer in this game. You don't exactly have time to "play with your food" unless survivors screw up royally. No other killer has to waste 7 seconds to actually be able to damage someone, let alone let survivor escape if they fail a skillcheck. I imagine that must be one of the most aggravating things as Freddy player, along with saving someone from hook right in your face. Definitely loses any "exit gates are open" end game tomfoolery. Before exit gates, imagine two survivors running from generator through you. You can only choose one of them to hit and chase. Any other killer can choose to hit one and chase the other, wasting survivor time and prolonging the game.
---
Can you make one with Huntress, Hag, and Spirit silhouettes!? 
---
I used to watch him pretty much exclusively on youtube. Saw him streaming on twitch at some point, and was met with that wall of text. It might sound petty, but a bad taste rarely leaves your mouth easily
---
omg no?? where can i watch it i want more david content &lt;33 
---
According to survivor mains Billy is not supposed to hit survivors under any circumstance.
---
Oof thats sp0oky
---
yea i spent £5 on that shirtless cosmetic to look like a lighthouse of flesh screaming come mori me myers 
---
I mean I understand killers do what they have to, to get their kills. When I play killer, I generally try not to go for the person sandbagged. Because if I’m on the hook, I can’t do anything when someone decides to instantly unhook me in front of the killer. But again, I don’t exactly care about kills very much. 
---

I've played survivor solo pretty much exclusively since about 100 hours in because my friend stopped playing. My soul is dying at this point
---
Can somebody create a thread filled with just gameplay recordings like this??
---
I play killer only occasionally so I'm at rank 13 on ps4. I haven't come across too many rage quitters so far. If they do rage quit its swf and the whole team will dc. Survivor I get to red ranks every season and from my experience green/purple ranks are the worse for rage quitters.

---
You will get called a camper and a tunneler regardless of what you do. Even if you go out of your way to not do those things, people will still say that you did. I don't facecamp because most of the time it's a bad idea, and tunneling can be the same way. That being said, I have no problem with taking advantage of survivors who make stupid decisions like unhooking right in front of me. I do what I have to to win. If I see someone injured and I know that they are one hook away from death, I will go after them. 
---
There's always a couple of hills as well as the central building there.

No haven’t had that fun yet. Did try to do Leatherface chainsaw mission the other night and when the rank 2 SWF decided to TBag a bunch I said fuck it and facecamped him...good times. He was livid but rudeness forgoes more rudeness. He lost his nice item while I sat there bareboned revving my chainsaw.
---
Is it me, or has this meme been a thing for about 2 months it feels like 
---
I get that argument, and generally agree. If it's a sandbag, if they're trying to bait you into attacking their teammate instead of them, then you should target the sandbagger. But if they're just being stupid and hook diving, looking for that free save, don't give it to them. At the least you should re-down the unhooked person if you don't want to rehook them. Deny the safe unhook bonus, deny the Benevolence progress, and deny the possible Deliverance activation.
---
Earning the first three or four coins isn’t time consuming at all, it’s the ones after that, that take forever. 
---
And this is one of the reasons I run bond. To see if anyone else to going for the save. If not then it falls on me to prevent first hook struggles. 
---
This absolutely made me bust a gut laughing

PS4 - Event Bug
---
Every game I've played today has awarded 0 moonrise points, despite escaping with lanterns twice and finishing five generators multiple times. I still get blood points, but no progress towards golden coins. 
---
Epic escape video my dude, that killer got trolled big time. My favourite part had to be you vaulting the window next to the exit gate. Well actually my favourite part was the way Feng's booty looked there. It kinda reminded me of Kim Kardashian and the way her bottom part looks, except that Feng's ass isn't fucking disgusting and doesn't jiggle like that one bridge. The one that jiggled so much it broke. The cars on that bridge were flying like it was that goddamn Jetsons cartoon.
---
I don't get it.
---
I thought that was David until I saw the finger guns 
---
I always waste a spot on wglf.  Then it depends on if I'm solo or swf. I've really been digging discordance because you get a lot of info you can share with the squad. 
---
Very poetic, *i cri evrytiem*
---
It's all good. I just play with friends and are like guys "I want the cosmetics" 
---
Don't.
---
For real though it's gonna be super tough, especially as the Huntress. I suggest you just keep changing your sensitivity until you find a setting that works for you.
---
I upgraded from noodle to stick you whale
---
Dont listen to these 100% sens "tips". I play nurse at 60 and if I miss, its very rarely because I couldnt turn fast enough. Same goes for Huntress.
---
Other than that id just say that you have to learn to accept that youll NEVER be as efficient as a PC Nurse/Huntress. Sounds like stupid advice but actually kept a lot of frustration away from me.
---
Altruism at its finest!
---
Definitely not red ranks teammate.
---
Me: "Wrong House, bud... Jason gon' f*ck you up!" 😂😂😂 jk
---
Honestly if youre in second phase and getting camped, i still save last second. Because there might be the off chance that you have dead hard/sb/et cetera. I know i am grateful that survivors clutch save me. the majority of the time the killer hits me too early off hook and i manage to get away.
---
Just keep practicing, that’s my tip you get better with time
---
PS4 in game bug:
---
Just played a game as Kate. Had balanced landing. Went off the side of the red combine on the farm map and it showed the icon for it being activated but instead I was stuck in sneak mode, could not stand up and the clown got me. 1st time Ive ever had this happen.
---
P3 Claudettes refer to that glitch when you get more than 1 killer in the lobby.  Their attacks include immersioning around the map, wasting pallets and not doing gens.
---
I'm starting to think that Leatherface brings out the stupid in survivors more than pretty much every other killer. I just played my first game on him in a few days (mory daily), so I moried the first person I downed twice (think it was like my 4th or 5th down overall), then chainsaw a dwight down next to the shack and hook him in basement. I see that someone's right nearby from BBQ, so when I come out of the basement and see a Meg with SB like 40m away obviously baiting, I fake chase for literally like 2 seconds before looking back and seeing scratch marks into basement.
---
For whatever god forsaken reason, the Feng who's going for the save proceeds to farm dwight on the hook while I casually rev up my chainsaw and down them both. Needless to say, at the end of the game I was a "camper" because I dared to not chase the sprint burst meg with a 40m head start when I knew there was someone about to go for the basement save.
---
Got my daily and a 4k though :D
---
Idk, im rank 5 surv on ps4 and right now i already have been waiting 15mins in the que.
---
all i have to do is sit on you once and youre done for
---
No this is all stupid. I’m telling you right now that you need to face the fact that there’s lots of people who play with their friends who are just casual/trying to have fun and are bad at the game. Not all SWF are gen rush death squads. This would be a death sentence to a lot of people playing at lower ranks who don’t know how to deal with good killers. This would also make que times longer. All this bias crap you’re spouting out is nonsense. There’s other things they could possibly do but not split the player base and give killers inf add ons. 
---
i have the same thing happen to me but with the wraith, every time i pick him my game just freezes for a couple of seconds.
---
Prove Thyself is garbage, it's still better to just solo Gens. Until the end game, obviously.
---
That's what I gather. So OP wants the numbers to stay at 25/20/25% but also wants it to affect repair speed. That would also stack with Prove Thyself for a total of 35% repair speed for survivors bear you. Methinks this guy is a survivor main.
---
Exactly and surprisingly those with decisive strike dc the most lol
---
This assholes was being chased and pulled me off the hook after leading the killer to me. I’m half convinced they did it to escape aggro 
---
Swf isnt even worth it anymore with 30 minute wait times just to have the killer DC so..
---
Ooh that’s cool! I definitely like the outfit the most out of the new ones, I don’t play Feng much anymore but I might have to start up again now that I have this..
---
Oh hey, overused title. I thought it was gone alr.
---
It's clearly intended as a way to increase the grind. Every other event spawned *at least* 1 per Bloodweb but with this event it's fixed to 1.
---
Thank fuck my Tapp had 36 from the last Lunar event.
---
bond,empathy,kindred,aftercare 
---
If someone is unhooked close to me, i tend to chase the savior even though i have an opportunity to secure a kill on the unhooked guy. Funny enough, when i come back to the hook, most people tend to think I'm about to tunnel someone, so they let me get a free hit on them by being a "distraction", which is fine by me.
---
I know how much it sucks to get tunneled, especially in the early game, and I'd rather give them a chance of having some fun instead of getting a couple extra bloodpoints and a salty message, even if it means getting no kills that game.
---
*Meaty whack*
---
*Both chuckle*
---
I'm going to be an outlier and say that I actually prefer the competition between survivors. The survivors' greatest strength is working together, so making us compete for an extra reward makes sense.
---
Yeah. It is getting pretty late too. Idk i havent been on in a while but i was playing with my bro a few hrs ago amd we got in a match 20 secs
---
An event where you spawn into the game as a random survivor/killer with random perks &amp; add-ons
---
That's Mary Jane from the Raimi Spider-Man films. 
---
Ok. So what is your idea to make that happen? I want that too but I haven’t been able to come up with a good idea yet. 
---
Yeah, I had no idea he was this hot in the remake.  Or rather, the actor who played him was a good-looking wrestler.
---
Willem Dafoe confirmed as a new killer. 
---
It’s saying how OchiDO is gone from the game because of Console Bans, and he transferred from Pc to console to prevent getting banned forever
---
They really need to put vaccume pallets and windows back into the game until they fix hitboxes. Even playing as killer it’s dumb how often I gets hits just lunging into pallets. 
---
Instant follow:D waiting for more amazing artworks!
---
depends what im feeling but usually iron will, adrenaline mostly, and then either prove thyself and bond, borrowed time and we'll make it, deliverance and empathy or unbreakable and distortion (I sometimes throw distortion in with any combo if theres been a lot of killers running bbq)
---
Practice makes perfect ;) 
---
🦀🦀🦀
---
I think it appeared twice because I got it in the shrine sometime in 2018. Leatherface is one of my lowest ranked killers.
---
The hatred over SWF is so dumb. I've done tons of matches against SWF and more often then not they're hurt by it because only some are actually good and/or they get overly altruistic. 
---
Honestly just suck it up and move on. This game would be half dead if not for SWF. I wouldn't play much if I could never play with my friends or if we could only do crappy gimped matches like you propose. 
---
And most of the time I see killers get as much or even more BP then survivors even if all the survivors get away.
---
Thanks! :D 
---
Have you read the rules of the subreddit? 
---
Thank you so much!! :’) 
---
Thank you, my dude :) 
---
It isn't about the cosmetics, I'd be equally annoyed with any reward for participating and grinding an event. I'm not even a huge fan of these cosmetics, getting THEM is not the point, participating and completing the event and having something to show for it is.
---
It's just that, an event. They changed the game to collect tokens to earn prizes, and instead their aim is to get you to just pay for the prizes anyway. If they wanted to run it like this, they may as well have just added the cosmetics to the store with a "Happy Lunar New Year" banner.
---
Thanks for your very angsty input, and your definitive decision that nobody is allowed to care about aspects of the game that you don't.
---
Oh, the same vaults that when you jump, teleport back to where you originally start, and then to get fucked by the killer
---
Okay wow, so I had Tier 3 braids on her, and now that I took them off, the game is no longer freezing when I switch to her.. That is wild, BHVR please fix your hairstyle
---
&gt; As long as the devs are willing to listen to constructive feedback from the fans 
---
Until this happens, nothing else matters
---
Oh no, what ever will I do without ochido fans sandbagging me and wasting pallets 
---
I refuse to buy the legion DLC out of principle. Poor Jeff, though. Maybe I’ll get him from the ingame store later.
---
? I don't think I understand lol
---
Ye just got into a match against a wraith who face camped and tunnelled.. and here i was hoping for a relaxing late night game lmao 
---
What do I do? Literally year of the pig and this happens, lmao.  
---
RIP Amanda.
---
Best games ever right? Lol
---
If you think killer is bad now you should have played the game before the countless surivivor nerfs (which were needed). But playing killer isn't as fun to me anymore, it isn't nearly as much of a challenge as it used to be.
---
I think he already does.
---
For some reason half this community thinks being able to 360 makes you a god even though any brand new player can google how and spend 30 mins mastering it in kyf
---
I liked the idea of that event. Unfortunately it didn’t go well because a lot of ppl just wanted to get the items and not play the game. We need to get the items as well as play the game. 
---
How would you change that event so it’s fun for all?
---
It's been like that...well since after the winter solstice but before this event. I bought the charity case pack around Jan 3 I think so it's been like that since then.
---
It's worse when you solo'ed 3+ gens and no one saves you.
---
To be fair i was only friendly because there as two of them lol

What have you been smoking?

Thank you! And yes, definitely! I'll upload it as soon as I can :D

Aaaah thank you! I personally don't mind the tally marks, I think it matches perfectly with the aesthetic they're going for, but yes it does get boring and uninspiring after a while (I only have about 100 hours in the game haha). 
---
Thank you!
---
Thank you!!
---
When i do my leatherface dailies, i run my basement build just incase the people are assholes. Normally i just do the dailies and let the survivors go, but if i get that one asshole, his teams gonna be hurting.
---
I have been playing DBD for 5 months, and I went p3 Claudette as well. I couldn't stop myself from doing it lol.
---
No troubles on my end.
---
Just practice. Accept that you're going to have some bad games. As Huntress, sometimes I'll just take time during a match and practice hatchet throws. Although it's been improved, there's still a lot of wonky collision issues with hatchets. For sensitivity I use 90 on Nurse and 60 with everyone else, but just use what you find most comfortable. 
---
the gif made my entire morning omg
---
I'll see what I can do, yeah? I have an idea of how to do it but I'm currently juggling full-time university and part-time work :P

Yeah bud

I totally get that, and I appreciate it! 
---
Do it to em.

Unlucky timing. Yesterday I managed to pull someone off a gen *as they completed it*.

PC - In Game
---
Owned the Nea Cosmetic Item “Pineapple Jersey”. In survivor cosmetic section it didn’t appear and was not wearable. 
---
Fixed by going into the Store Section and equipping it from that menu, however it caused minor confusion.
---
Very nice but wtf is your build? xD
---
That's not a problem that I experienced because I just farmed for the whole event and got my Feng from no prestige to P3. 
---
Not even close.
---
Never. 
---
Post the source?
---
I wouldn't change a thing. Just farm during events.
---
You taking commissions my dude!?
---
Guys! I uploaded [two versions](https://imgur.com/gallery/6HmiEWD) on imgur! I fixed the gradient lines and I have a separate version without the tally marks! 
---
Nailed it....basement camper. 
---
Usually when I abandon the chase, I just don't find them or run into them again, but healed. I'll keep that in mind and just stop long chases altogether.
---
Thanks for supporting a garbage killer
---
there is a huge difference between tunneling/camping and taking advantage of the survivors' mistakes. hooking someone and walking around them close enough to get there in case someone tries to unhook is tunneling. hooking someone only for them to be immediately unhooked, and then downing and hooking them once more, *is not tunneling nor camping.* 
---
especially as killer, you have to rely super hard on the survivors mistakes. and that is one of those mistakes.
---
chances are, if you do that, they will flame you. but not because their point is valid, but because they refuse to acknowledge their own mistakes. 
---
Is it better to use two range increasers or one range combined with the one for faster static field madness?
---
Why would you think that style of play is going to lead to a bunch of points? That ain’t on the event, that’s on you.
---
I always make fun of killers who run an endgame build: you just wasted perk slots, bro!
---
P R E T T Y  G O O D  J O B  S O  F A R 
---
Theyre both bad game design and shouldnt exist period. 
---
Looks like a meme team, but I can't really tell. Don't feel bad. Sometimes youtube videos can tell you how to do fundamentals better but some people just have so many more hours than you spent specifically looping so there's not much you (or sometimes anyone) can do about that.
---
see me after class teacher
---
I just bought her on release because Susie is best girl.
---
who hurt you Janice?
---
What's p3?
---
Absolutely agree. As I’m a survivor main, 95% of playing solo queue, 2 years for more than 2,500 hours, I barely won in high-rank no matter how good I am. Lacking of communication and less than 3 man at starting the trial are the worst things for playing solo, and most killers love that due to the ez pz hunt and less stress comparing to SWF. So, that’s why I usually hate tryhard killers and some useless teammates. 
---
I did play 4 man SWF with communication for 2-3 matches and I found that it’s too easy to win no matter how good and bad killers are. Cause we all know what to do, we all know what killers are doing, and those are huge advantages for me. Oh, we were rank 1 btw.
---
I love this game, but playing solo queue still punishing me so bad. It needs some love but it’s just a dream. 
---
Please stop with the hate
---
Yeah, I guess I gotta play more. It's just soul-crushing after a while
---
Problem is the dude being tunneled isn’t making any mistakes. It’s his asshole teammates that are ruining his game and you as the killer are allowing them to get what they want at the expense of someone’s match. 
---
That is funny
---
Not from twitch, I don't remember the specifics though sorry :(
---
It's my (patient pending) "This was my First Killer that I Only Got to Level 33, so He Has Whatever Crap I Had" build. I'm thinking it has high teir potential.

Original Mikael is the one to light my loins on fire, the other guy just looks like that murderer from Hannibal on steroids

The guy who was unhooked wasn’t doing anything. They got sandbagged by their teammate and then the killer “punished,” them for something they have zero control over.

Yah of course. No way is it possible a killer can tunnel. That's impossible it's never happened before. Every single time the survivor deserved. Every time no matter what. Also nice purity argument
---
If you hold the ps button and go to dbd and currently playing with you can see who yhe killer is
---
Me: Legion doesn't have to tunnel.
---
You: Oh I see. You think killers don't ever tunnel.
---
Just say you have low reading comprehension. 
---
I had something similar happen to my Nea on Ps4 but for all of my purchased items for her. Fixed it the same way.
---
Devs at it again - making people play killer 😂
---
In this case though the survivors poor play was probably just going for saves against a camper. That doesn’t mean the camper should get a bunch of points. Everyone knows the scoring going in. For  someone to go into a game with a strategy to basement camp, which goes against the way to get points, and then complain about the lack of points is silly.
---
yep, those of us with jobs and responsibilities and want to just come home and play the game and have fun, not treat it like a 2nd job because we need to first grind out shit that effects gameplay.  
---
Though I agree they need to optimize for console and it's long overdue, just like everyone here I've had zero problems with framerates while holding a lantern
---
Spine Chill for alerting stealthy killers 
---
Aftercare/bond for better teamwork, maybe..
---
Borrowed Time against campers/tunneler 
---
Balance Landing for prolonging chase just a little bit.
---
Gimmie a kiss shocky boi
---
All they did was get the juice and no saves or gens and got all salty when the killer got them
---
Bond is the best perk in the game IMO. I feel naked without it.
---
No critism please
---
I do believe so, the bloodweb never ends but prestige gives better chance for rare items
---
Change to appear offline will hide your PSN 
---
Spirit is OP? How? Her perks are all shit, her phase walking is easy to counter explain what's op?
---
It was not a question, and honestly the prestige rarity thing is a hell of a placebo. 
---
Prestige 3
---
You get event points without the offering. OP is talking about the bonus blood points. Those require the event offering.
---
only if you take rancor with it  
---
jk
---
Thanks
---
Ok
---
Screaming for help?
---
purple or green rank for sure. red rank would teabag your corpse after the killer moris you
---
Not on pc at least
---
What the fuck 
---
As a Spirit main, I have 27 currently sitting in my inventory collecting dust and they will never be used.
---
I despise them.
---
The issue comes from the killer being the games host you won’t have to constantly re invite once hey get dedicated servers this summer 
---
If you're not careful the entity will here you
---
I mainly just rely on self care, tbh. The others I use don’t really come into play as much as I’d like them too. I will say unbreakable has saved my ass multiple times, though. 
---
First, by what the OP posted, this wasn't sandbagging. It was hook diving, it was bad Survivors making bad plays looking for the Killer to let them do it. Not someone trying to screw a fellow Survivor to lose heat on themselves or trying to farm. Those are completely different situations that warrant different responses.
---
Second, it's not the unhooked person being punished. It's the unhooker, and the team as a whole. The unhooked person is just the unfortunate one caught in the middle. There's no reason to get mad at a Killer for not being stupid and for not letting stupid Survivors be stupid. Get mad at the Survivor(s) who hook dive and unhook directly in front of the Killer when there's zero reason to.
---
"OMG, like, I unhooked my friend, like, totally 2 feet from you and, like, instead of, like, letting him get free and, like, giving me bonus unhook points, Benevolence emblem progression, and letting my Deliverance activate, like, you totally hit him and, like, hooked him again! Like, totally not cool dude. Like, you should totally reward me for doing something, like, so totally stupid with free points, rank progress, and the ability to, like, totally unhook myself later." - *Bad Survivor mains*
---
Yes, it sucks to be that Survivor on the hook. I've been there. But in that scenario the Killer is doing the right thing and not rewarding shitty play by, at the very least, putting you back on the ground if not back up on the hook.
---
You should be able to end most loops fairly quickly with the clown 
---
Ok. This is sick. 
---
Yup. Apparently waiting in a queue for an extra 2 to 30 minutes makes you just more excited to annoy the person who gave you the game.
---
Loool I don’t mind playing killer ahaha just rather play survivor with my buddy’s. Although I’m finally getting points for survivor

Yeah, game was already ruined for me when Legion is there. And I'm definitely not the only person who does that, personally and on these forums, I know plenty of people that agree. It's a game. I try to have fun in games man. Chill.
---
I meant in general, not specific to this post.
---
The unhooker is only being punished under certain circumstances. Most of the time the one being punished is the unhooked as they just got sandbagged and farmed while the unhooker is suffering no immediate and possibly no penalty at all.
---
And if that isn’t a SWF your entire point just lost 90% of its value. If it is a SWF farming their team and then getting upset at you it’s on the other two.
---
Hardly doing the right thing as they can apply more pressure by not tunneling. 
---
Typically something along the lines of:
---
WGLF/Balanced Landing/Dead Hard, 
---
Adrenaline
---
Bond/Aftercare, 
---
Autodidact/We'll make it/ Borrowed Time
---
Similar thing happened to me yesterday but instead, all of my purchased killers/survivors disappeared. I restarted it and they came back but they were all in the outfits/cosmetics they start with so I had to change them back. 
---
oh dang, sorry 
---
The wraith is going to have such a huge fucking lunge with fast food since he can lose the chase by cloaking 
---
Legion has no counterplay.
---
just when I thought this game couldn't get any scarier
---
Should probably add a cap to that 
---
Was my last game. Grabbed the lantern and was basically did 4 gens and walked out with no interaction from killer or team. Was oddly relaxing
---
what?
---
No we need 1000% lunge wraith
---
Does it imply that? It implies that the buddy system makes the boss mad..
---
I'd buy a dlc for that 
---
I bet it's because the country motto of Kenya is Harambee which translates to "Let us all pull together" which you know Jeffs perks and you know Legion is a Legion.
---
Are you playing on PC? The pallet drop button should be space unless you've changed it 
---
Watch Damnnohtml’s video on how to run all generic tiles. Very helpful and will shorten loops drastically. Want to make them even shorter? Throw your bottles at loops and cut off their routes. 
---
just got hit through a fucking window again kms on first hook
---
She's one of the hardest killers, but very effective if used right. The most important thing is learning how to track survivors through sound when you're phasing. Also learn how to mind game with her power if you haven't already
---
F**s.
---
Fuks?
---
Fucs?
---
Funs?
---
Who's downvoting funs?
---
Switching to The Nightmare and back to The Pig fixed it. Makes you wonder if *that bug* is a nightmare :p
---
Im a Huntress/Legion Main myself and have similar Problems with Nurse, can barely get 1 Hit with her....might just be that certain Killers dont work for some People 
---
Who wouldn't 
---
But killers are screwed so bad by points they get 4 matches in the time it takes survivors to get 1
---
He did some "funny" montages on Youtube that were heavily edited and often made fun of Killers that made mistakes at lower ranks.  Typically supported/encouraged toxic gameplay esp. since he started asking for folks to send clips in to win Auric Cell packs or whatever.  
---
Frequently a rank 1 killer but as a solo I can't stand playing survivor. Most games end like you describe and i just don't find joy in it.
---
Clearly, you are a non-believer. 
---
Survivor mains 
---
sounds edgy af...let me try...cant think of anything :(
---
nope
---
To be good enough to kill people so there's not 4 fully healed people dancing at the exit most matches
---
Might be a ban on the actual device/license or something.  
---
Well I'm almost certain they were sfw. And I figured by downing the guy off the hook I was stopping the instantsaver from getting safe unhook points.
---
Like I said, the best you can really do is confuse the killer
---
Menu issue on PS4:
---
The new system for changing between survivors/killers by using the trigger buttons (L2/R2 on PS4) is terrible. I can't even set my controller down without the game freaking out and changing my survivor/killer multiple times. This functionality needs to switch to the bumpers (L1/R2 on PS4) or at least be mappable.
---
It's because everyone is playing survivor since that is the fastest way to get event points since killers will be lucky to get 20 a match. Because of this instead of say killer/survivor ratio being let's say 50/50 it is now like 95/5 the 95 being survivors. I am exaggeration those numbers a bit
---
Look up and spam that action bttn 
---
Cutie cunt
---
Oops, forgot to specify what I’m playing on. It’s PS4. 
---
Someone got his lamp stolen
---
Exactly how I feel on console 
---
Mario killer/ Bowser survivor
---
Clearly 
---
Stress master: You work well under pressure. All your action speeds are increased by 10/15/20% while in the killers terror radius. 
---
Lore nerd: You've spent too long studying these beasts. At the start of the match 2/3/3 of the killers perks and 0/0/1 of their addons is revealed to you at random. 
---
Big boned: You carry a little extra weight with you, it makes the hits hurt a little less. You have one extra health state, but you cannot fast vault. Exhaustion lasts 30/20/10% longer. 
---
Sensitivity is all up to you, you’ll want something that can track survivor movements easily, but won’t be like “move it a teeny bit and it makes you turn 90 degrees”. Honestly besides that there’s no tips. It’s just loads of practice, and even then the inconsistency in the frame rate of maps and the inherent input lag of consoles and TV setups coupled with hatchet travel time make even some of the closer range shots more prediction based rather than precision based. So really, to mitigate this issue it’s recommended that you get a good monitor with very low input delay. A lot of TVs even with game mode have upwards of 100ms input delay. If you’re on a regular console, not the pro or X, you’ll find it difficult because of the drastic FPS inconsistency. Having a pro or x makes a world of difference. 
---
Can't help you then sorry, I hope you can work it out!
---
I mean in general, not solely in your game. And being almost certain isn’t enough to justify a case.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
I'll be honest. I made it for the humor, not the accurate representation. ;P
---
Athlete: your athletic background makes you run 5/10/15% faster.  You recover from falls 5/10/15% faster.  Your aura is revealed to the killer for 3/2/1 seconds after landing from a fall.
---
Overconfidence: your aura is revealed to the killer after completing a generator for 10/8/6 seconds.  You complete generators 8/12/16% faster.
---
Showboating: after saving a survivor from the hook instantly heal them one health state and reveal your aura to the killer for 4/5/6 seconds.  Gain double bloodpoints for all altruistic actions.
---
Number def need to be tweaked but you get the idea
---
Ur mom 
---
I dont even bother using event offering on killer, I just use survivor pudding kill everyone cap 1m and use em on survivor since I only find games solo
---
25-45 on survivor is better than. 
---
8-14 on killer + the time it takes to run around looking for fucking lamps
---
The devs fully intend you to tunnel atleast 1 player to death, you don't have enough time to 'play nice' and hook everyone twice before they escape.
---
If Survivors are bitching about what you're doing, that's a hint that it's working.
---
Careful it requires quite some skill to craft the shit, it can't be too big because then he wont belive you, then you have to shape it a little so it doesn't look too suspicious.
---
Maybe, but he'd be rebanned for ban evasion if he did. That's why he was banned on PS4 as soon as console bans became a thing, he's been banned on PC for a long time.
---
I'd prefer it to be someone they've gone up against in the game. It wouldn't fit to put Negan in when she doesn't know them. All other licensed survivors aside from Bill got someone who they knew and fought, Tapp with the pig/Jigsaw, Quentin with Freddy, and Laurie with Myers. 
---
The issue is finding someone that fits.
---
Smack a bong if you've been there
---
Then I guess you just hooked your roommate
---
Yes it does
---
“Remove the game it’s far too unbalanced”
---
You could try playing killer.
---
Oh yeah 
---
Zarbon likes
---
People don't like him because there's no counterplay to his power. Pallets and windows are the only tools survivors have and he removes them. 
---
No wonder no one watches your streams
---
To be fair, I do that too because it's funny AF.
---
🦀 
---
Australia players are tired of being ignored 
---
Ràaaaaàa
---
Well first your perks, also using clown correctly with good add ons. If people are looping you then you just chuck a tonic down at them or where they’re running to.
---
Clearly a cosmetic worth hours of grinding/paying $10 dollars for.
---
Good Riddance
---
Had a game recently where I looped a Wraith for 5 gens and the other three survivors just waited at the gate together, making no attempt to get to me. I ended up with a depip because I had 8k boldness and 1k for everything else. I just don’t understand why people can’t be bothered to help, even when you make their experience easier.
---
Holy shit.
---
Dang dude why you gotta bring up my moms ;-;
---
Did you just assume his post? 
---
Holy shit 
---
He is a good killer that can deal with high rank survivors, but his skill floor and ceiling are very low and you dont need more than a day to master him. Thats my only problem
---
i changed a couple of my binds a week or so back, yeah it fucks you up for a couple of games.
---
Just played a killer game and got 0pts despite killing 3 by sacrifices. Played an envelope too. :/
---
I want to love this game but the development side of it is honestly an embarrassment.
---
they do!😚💕
---
Im a p3 level 5 pig main. 
---
No point in camping a masked surv
---
is that coonts?
---
True, but Killer mains never came together to spam DBD's steam page with negative reviews. Survivor mains have.
---
Yeah it's like Billy's double speed add ons they stack they just got lazy on Spirit
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with Billy.  He is just as weak to pallet looping as most killers and has the potential like Learherface to be even more so depending on if they get too chainsaw happy.  Also his saw can be juked using lots of objects in the environment.  He's a very strong killer but certainly not an unbalanced one.
---
He got nearly 20 points. A survivor that died got like 30. Doesn’t matter what his build is or even if most consider it a toxic way of playing.
---
Mori every Claudette that enters your lobby
---
The dude seriously almost died
---
Does this actually work? Lol actually sounds very enticing
---
Because alot of people who place this game have a huge ego.
---
KILLER KILLED ME! 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07So_lJQyqw
---
BAN THEM! ;o;
---
Mask your crying by typing lmao and lol every second in chat
---
Muscle memory's a bitch :/
---
Okay, but the way it feels to play solo survivor during this event is just... really not enjoyable. At least when there was the bug where every survivor that escaped/died after someone left with a lantern got the points I wouldn't mind trying to save someone or take aggro from them so they could leave with the lantern. 
---
The sound it makes when someone DC's tho lol
---
I'll drink to that
---
If you are quick enough, yes. 
---
Keep in mind, you only have about enough time to get two hits and very quick pick up one person. Taking too long will make all survivors disconnect. Doing this quickly enough will look like a lag spike to survivors. They'll know what you did. But they also know what they did. 
---
Fire with fire. 
---
I have dc-ed out of frustration tbh. 
---
So what does that tell you then.
---
Most of the community agrees Billy is fine and countered by looping, which is a justified trade off for the pressure and ability to capitalise misplays that he has.
---
Other killers need to brought up to A tier, Billy doesn't need to be taken out of it when his counter is the mechanics of the game.
---
Yes you can. It's just harder for the killer to time it.
---
But it’d 2010 reboot Freddy! Much darker and kiddy diddler
---
TIL Freddy = Claudette
---
Avgn: Take you're damn cloths off!
---
I benefitted maybe 10% of the time, the other times I either escaped with a beacon like normal or used a key. I did burn through 37 Milky Glasses and 18 keys though.

---
Matchmaking hell. Not a new problem.
---
Advocating lag switching which is literally cheating and a bannable offense really dude?  Take that trash to r/patheticcheaters
---
/shrug
---
I hate people who sit at the gate just to tbag like this.
---
Don't do that it'll get you banned if they record the game.  It's called lag switching and it is a form if cheating.
---
So go do some other things. Distract the killer, cleanse totems or unhook people. There plenty of things to do that aren't just gens.
---
I don't see an issue with that. He is very basic and limited to the loops of a map and the survivors who run them.
---
Where as higher skilled killers can directly bypass these counters, but at the cost of other downsides such as movement speed or mobility.
---
Who said I ever leave the locker ;)
---
They are BM dickheads sure but they aren't cheaters how is this fire with fire.  Terrible metaphor /ezban 
---
I just realized I haven’t played against legion in like 3 days. I swear to god if my next game is legion...
---
Yeah that's common when people are still trying to grasp her. Just make sure you get nice and close to them before reappearing for your hit. If you have katana tsuba or wakizashi saya, you don't have to get as close as the extra post phase state speed and duration will give you mega lunges.
---
I play swf I average 10 minutes wait time 
---
Solo survivor 5 mins killer almost instantly the problem is there matchmaking system they updated to is only effective in an area of people who play in your area im pretty sure its god awful i pretty much dont play near as much as i used to
---
Hunters Mark seems really op there is no limit to the amount of tokens you can get and if you get quite a few tokens even Midway through the game you are garenteed the mori on everyone and combine that with remember me and no will ever leave.
---
P3 Claudettes have a 5% spawn rate and can be found in corners in tall grass or next to trees and typically spawn with flashlights or fire crackers. Happy hunting!!! More information can be found in your DBDdex!
---
Alternatively, I can facecamp every game, but I don't.
---
I'm fine with tbagging anywhere else in the game, or maybe even on the way out a gate during an actual chase
---
But wasting my time by sitting at a gate, purely to insult me is extremely irritating. 
---
If they laugh that they got to me, whatever. I still get a few extra points as compensation. 
---
"Would you like to hear about our lord and savior?"
---
Hits are fine. You're getting paired with killers on Mars because no one is playing killer, and no one is playing killer because this event is so obviously shit for killer.
---
I agree! No counter play. 
---
Needs more jpeg.

No he just doesn't stream anymore. He still plays, then uploads the recordings. Ochido is a cockroach, there's no getting rid of him.
---
Just got to get practice and learn some tricks to kill off some survivors before endgame.
---
Always ignore the obsession until you've killed other survivors first is usually solid advice.  They typically want to be chased and run decisive so you get nothing from chasing them.  
---
Don't engage in long chases.  Tunneling a good survivor let's the rest gen rush you hard.  I typically test out each survivor on first loop.  If they're weak and I know I can down them quickly I stay on them.  If they're strong I get them to toss whatever pallet we're at, break it, then leave them to pressure gens.
---
Know what areas of a map to abandon a chase at.  Never chase a survivor into Crotus Prenn Asylum or Badham Preschool unless you have to at that stage of the game.  Building like that can be looped for multiple gens.
---
Learn to identify unsafe pallets.  They're are pallets that once you trap a survivor at it result in a near guaranteed mind game hit 
---
Truetalent and Tyde Tyme have some incredibly informative videos on their pages that should help you I'd check those out.  I know Tyde just posted a killer guide yesterday haven't watched it yet.  When I was first starting out I learned a lot from their content. 
---
Spotlight- Every time you flashlight stun a killer gain a token (max 5), at 5/4/3 tokens your next flashlight is instant if aimed on killer using tokens. You do not gain tokens from instant-blind.
---
"Its my time to shine"-Slick
---
 
---
Here We Go Again- For every succesful chase escape gain a token (max 2). For every token gain 1/2/3% movement speed. Lose a token when hit, lose all tokens when put in dying state. Negative Status durations last 20/15/10 percent longer.
---
"I can go all day, maybe..."-Slick
---
I see you there- Pointing directly at the killer reveals thier aura for 4/5/6 to all survivors. Perk activates if pointed within 6/8/10 meters. Can only activate once every 60 seconds.
---
"I might be blind, but i can still see that ugly mug"

The cheers quickly turned into gasps and screams as Randy’s body cleared the threshold at increased speed now partially propelled by the explosive force of both his still heart discharging blood out of his neck and all 3 of the Newtonian Laws of Physics, especially the one concerning “Force = Mass x Acceration” (The Second) and Randy’s mass had decreased by the weight of one human head, about 10 to 11 pounds or two 5 pound bags of flour or sugar, and whatever mass of blood now trailed his flailing body like the skid mark of a drifting car. Eventually his body coasted to a stop as his feet jutted against the adjoing wall, his neck gushed and continued to do so, like an accidentally overturned and uncapped full gallon of milk but red.
---
The original Frank's Mix Tape build lol 
---
Did you forget /s ?
---
This is the internet. It is dangerous to forget that /s
---
Loop the window 3 times at least and then use the pallet only if absolutely necessary (though most of the time you can run to a nearby loop since the killer is expect you to go to the shack pallet) and just drop it there.
---
It's one of the safest pallets in the game and wasting it is a terrible idea. I usually leave people on the hook or farm them if they throw down shack pallet instantly for no reaosn.
---
But you lose your points then?
---
I AM AWARE OF THIS.
---
When I played on Xbox you HAD to pay for Huntress, but now that I moved to PC and don’t play Xbox, I wasn’t aware of that change.
---
I’ve always played on Xbox dude. Huntress has been free since release.
---
I got the game release day on Xbox. Bought Huntress release day. I paid for it. I don’t know what you’re talking about Willis.
---
It will come up that you lost at pit but once your back waiting for a lobby it will show up again
---
Submit and bend over for him and let him have his way with me XD 
---
Well.... then they weren’t that wrong. You knew they were “around” then go away but not too far. Let them get off the hook and be strategic with your hits. 
---
AH DUUUUUUUUUUUUUD XD
---
Did she have any addons? 
---
Witch, Jockey, Smoker, or Hunter would have been pretty unique, actually. Not that I'm disagreeing, because "unique" doesn't always equal "Good", but what have you.
---
This^. If they can figure a way to make it register like deliverance (certain action to unlock) that would be a decent change. 
---
Was going to do that, was just patrolling the hook to make sure that they wouldnt unhook the second I walked away
---
It says it does, but it really doesn’t. 
---
It's been one week since you looked at me
---
I mean you’re wrong but ok. I just went through my purchase history on Xbox.
---
Always been free. Dunno what you did by Huntress has ALWAYS been free.
---
Nah, I think it means that OP wants everyone to log into their porn accounts two downvoted his comment twice. 
---
Be thankful you don't know him. 
---
Its a song by AWOL nation.
---
Post game salt is priceless. Pregame dodges or people asking for farmcity that bothers ms
---
I mean, I have been playing far less during this event than I have before the event. I just got my third coin. SO hard to grind for this.
---
If only I was playing Ace at the time.  Would have been a perfect setup for an Ace in the Hole joke.  Tragic.
---
I don’t mind the grind or the ranks but I think they should change the bloodweb up to where it isn’t one perk per web. It’s getting to the point where I got so many perks it takes ten plus bloodwebs to get a perk I’m looking for. Took me 3 million bloodpoints to get the perks for a wraith build I’m doing.
---
He's really dependant on perks. I find him devastating with a Spirit Fury and enduring combo.
---
It was an accident I had no time to change lol
---
How dare you insult the meme lords that are pig players?
---
oinc
---
Are you using the sword looking weapon for wraith, it’s a green background on the customization icon for it. Every time I have that equipped it has that issue
---
WHY AM I TOXIC
---
How is he still uploading on his YT? Does he have multiple accounts or something?
---
He looks like the Cockney Hitcher too which is another Mighty Boosh character like Old Gregg but ruder. Which they still had clips of him up on youtube :(
---
Since when have you ever gotten credit for another survivor escaping on anything else?  Doesn't even remotely make sense.  And in spite of what this useless video shows its still better to play survivor on event.
---
Thanks for telling me absolutely nothing I didnt already know, and making me pause the video each time text popped up.  /s
---
I expected down votes just cause you mentioned killers having trouble but its true. 
---
Killers need everyone to use an offering, hook everyone 2x at least without anyone getting into the struggle phase first hook**,** find the lamp hit one before the farmed survivor gets unhooked or dies**,** then get a 4k just to equal 5 gens and escape with a vessel.
---
 That is a lot of work for killers compared to survivors so yeah i do feel sorry for killer mains and since everyone knows how easy it is for survivor to farm the points its a slow Que for many in rank 1-5 especially and below is slow too. sucks imo.
---
I think they were thinking shirtless William Shatner, cuz that’s his face and that’s how he gets in every kerfuffle.
---
Better than grinding for items and add ons only.

Is 30 hours a week regular for you?
---
Oooooooh I'm ready for my prostate exam doctor. 
---
Cool
---
As survivor I personally DC against certain addons (if you're bringing Iridescent Hatches you didnt really want to play the game anyway so I'm just helping) or if I get sandbagged by a teammate. 
---
I've never DC'd as killer, I make so much bloodpoints just be existing I tend to not care what happens in the match.
---
Feng's cosmetic is the best of the event by far. Huntress is pretty cool. The Ace one is stupid and I'd be shocked to see anyone go for it.
---
Clementine has 2 perks: one of them makes everyone realize shes too much of a godamn cutie to kill. The other forces the killers memories of the original game to make them let everyone escape. Too op, dont make her suffer the entity's realm
---
SEND ME NUDESSSSSS DUDDDDD hella fucked up though.
---
so basically you're a giant baby who's mad killer isn't playing the game by your made up rules.  DCing because on addon.. fuck buddy.. how fragile are you?
---
Not sure? But they still sold it back. BHVR bought it and they owe money still to starbreeze. They can very well go under if they try and make another flop like DG 
---
Xbox1 initialization error message when at the loading screen. It suggests i quit the game, as ive tried that and long restart of the console. Anyone else seeing this error message
---
I was meaning to wait for Lithe to show up in the Shrine, but i'll be getting Feng with shards for this cosmetic. Too bad I already got Doc with shards or i might just buy Spark of Madness.
---
No that shit happens all the time nothing to do with luck or timing. It would be a nice trick for Freddy if it really is sprinting off a gen though. Skill checks in dream state take forever
---
NO FUNS ALLOWED!
---
In a Video Games?
---
The bigger problem here is that you can depip as a survivor despite maxing out one of the pip categories.
---
Yet all it takes is a single safe hook rescue and a full gen complete and you're set for a +1 pip.
---
I like that you're doing something with bloodlust. Personally, I'd half the current timer at tier 3 (-7.5 sec) just to make it nice and even. Could be pretty nice.
---
iri head + inf belt will always be the best
---
Can someone tell me who this is?
---
I don't main huntress but I hear the rusty ax head is brutal (the one the inflicts mangled) and also Iridescent heads and infiltry belt
---
Haha I told ya man! Always been free
---
Why are you so angry lmao. Iri heads are annoying to go against. Why would I play a game where I'm not going to have fun?
---
Get gud

66,666 bloodpoints is how you obtain him 
---
No. I've just been playing Feng to wear her dress and have been using Alert as a result.
---
But he showed his shock, not his zap! That’s just too dirty. 
---
Someone always has to say something ignorant, he's probably a face camper who says that his "play style" 😅
---
My problem is that every event every year has the same tilted point scheme making matchmaking a nightmare. People refuse to play killer during these events because why waste your time getting less points for things that require more skill and less holding a button.
---
They based him off of Simon also

---
You don't, that's the thing. It's funny, when players complained that Spirit was too weak after her release, the devs said that they didn't make every killer to be viable at rank 1 like Nurse, Myers, Billy, Huntress. They wanted killers to be fun above anything else. And then the next killer they make is Legion, too weak, impossible to buff without a complete rework, not fun to play as or go against, and with no counterplay.
---
They couldn't have screwed up the design any worse if they tried.
---
Yes, you are right but I barely care about points anymore. I just play for fun now that my builds are ok. And waiting is not fun.
---
This subreddit needs more people like you.

Yeah for that one your only option is the basement stairs.

At least it gives the killer a secondary objective, rather than camping.  Now get out there and earn your points killers 
---
Iridescent heads are powerful addons, but they very toxic and will just lead to survivors DC or suicide early. 
---
But from my experience.
---
Wind-up buffs&gt;movement speed increase&gt;hindered debuff status&gt;exhaustion status. Extra hatchets and then everything else.
---
Yeah outside of iri head? Sincd that one is u rare, so isnt gonna be used regularly
---
Doctor illusions appear in tier 2. Although there is plenty you can do to avoid reaching tier 2: lockers, crouching, and most reliably terror radius awareness. 
---
This is dumb. Im sorry lol.
---
That’s why you’re not a good survivor 
---
You look cold af, but you're trying to play it off. lol
---
Ochido
---
I thought you might not be
---
Bone Clapper makes it global (as in you always hear it as if it was right behind you.) Coxcombed Clapper makes it completely silent.
---
There's no way to survive longer (except trying to juke) but to not waste time you can do gens, mend, and don't heal.
---
Mori is a visceral 
---
You are the reason that games die, i really hope you dont vote that kind of logic is so toxic. My god, the inability to empathize at this level i just tragic. Muh 30k bp tho, muh internet points tho. 
---
I have my interactions (repairing and healing) set to R1 and my actions (vaulting and pallet dropping) set to square so they don't over lap.
---
But he’s fun to play tho I don’t think it’s funny playing against Freddy because you can’t see him
---
He's meh without Frank's mixtape, but you're right there's no way to counterplay him. He needs to be reworked. 
---
I got the Ace Hair, it looks pretty Dapper with the suit that was in the old cosmetic bundles. Otherwise I will probably get huntress items (I never bought feng since I got her perks in the shrine).
---
People gets salty for nothing in this game
---
He will hack his data back like he did last time
---
Frame rate still makes the game unplayable on console. Also the Doctor still can't see the aura of his fake pallets. PS4. 
---
This is the same guy that got exposed on twitter for starting drama on twitter with a bunch of streamers. Not only that, but he was also known to be hitting on underage children.
---
I like ochido vids
---
Just ran into the exact same thing. Threw the match as billy. (double hook everyone then just play stupid) Let them all live. Still safety pip with 28k points. I feel bad for them with these queue times, even if they had 2 rank 2s and I'm only 9. I play on ps4 and our queues have been 20min+ for survivors. Literally had a guy send me a message thanking me for not dodging while we were loading in.
---
Before there was no indicator of ping, people would spam numbers in order to try to estimate their ping, based on the delay between them sending the number, and it appearing in chat.
---
It’s shockingly quick for the first three coins, and Feng is arguably the best of the bunch.
---
Lmao I'm waiting till the event is done yo play dbd again 
---
You’re a stupid cunt, haven’t played since the spirit I can post whatever I please you do not have to comment. 
---
Don't camp pallets.
---
I'm a killer main and I feel FORCED to play killer because of the survivor queue times. I want to casually play survivor at times but JESUS CHRIST!
---
On one hand, yeah it sucks that it takes so long to grind for coins, but on the bright side, none of the Killers that I actually play got skins in first place! So it's basically just a regular game but with hoards of swf groups that make me want to kill myself! I'll tell ya, being a killer main is the time my life!
---
Probably would be too close to the guy from Last Year for them to consider
---
Maybe if you had a look through the reddit or just videos on youtube you would find out you aren't the only one.

At least Summer BBQ gave bloodpoints and had more than 1 event offering per web. This time around it’s a joke lol
---
Then when I'm against a Freddy I full heal then do a full gen and stay asleep.
---
Not really sure tbh, just picked someone up
---
why did this make me laugh
---
Same can be said for killer on a bunch of maps though. Fucking haddonfield and the preschool. God I hate those maps. 
---
upvote just for the template
---
Kk
---
I would honestly rather just see them fix some of the killers that are already in the game than trying to introduce new ones. Freddy and Legion both just need complete reworks. I honestly think that Freddy's design has potential if they just reworked it slightly, but I have no idea if Legion is even salvageable. Either way, neither is healthy for the game.
---
Some of the other killers need some adjustments as well, but I think that most are in a pretty good place. Some are limited by bugs, such as the doctor, and some just need there number changed around a bit. I think the Trapper would be fine if the Trapper Sack was just inherent and they made the "start with one extra trap" add on yellow or green and removed the others. Maybe also make the escape mechanic a bar instead of a percent chance, so it ends up being more predictable for both the killer and survivor, instead of RNG reliant.
---
I'm your friendly neighborhood watcher Mikey. I just patrol lanterns and spin so survivors know where they are. Or I just stand somewhere the whole game and observe
---
Soooooo good
---
I don’t trust these hoes to heal me so I heal myself. 
---
I have broken the shackles of Urban Evasion and transcended both time and space to become the One Supreme Nea Deity.  
---
Look upon me and tremble survivors.  I have but one commandment.  Thou shalt not waste pallets.
---
The satisfaction of them not getting the 25 points is plenty to make it worth it
---
Fair, no hard feelings
---
You don’t 
---
That damn Claud!
---
I switched to killer for this event. Getting twice the points in the same time frame as I did survivor because I’m getting 5 times the lobbies as I did survivor 
---
You need to unhook while in the killer's terror radius. 
---
It's a must,  lot of killers think they need to camp hooks for thier point to count 
---
I know 
---
Bubba most likely
---
That’s a 🔑 to success right there. I salute. 
---
Is that how it always worked? I didnt know this about it and couldve sworn I've saved outside the TR and BT still worked
---
You have no idea what I'd give to have Ace's Chinese outfit for the Doctor.
---
You implying Ace is more powerful than the locker god himself?
---
Holy fuck you spend too much time on here 
---
r/ihavesex
---
Put that Feng Min top on Amanda and I am fucking set my friend. 
---
You have to be within the terror radius of the killer (i.e. the heartbeat, or lullaby) in order for borrowed time to activate. Keep in mind, perks and add ons or powers the killer can run that shrink their terror radius count.
---
If you haven't, I recommend getting hours as survivor. It really helps to know how they think and react. Also, you'll become more aware of just how limiting the first person perspective is.
---
you do know he can just make a new account, PS4 allows you to make them for free, and he can just keep playing. I doubt they will ban his console.
---
I've been playing killer because I still earn more to play killer than wait 30 minute to an hour for one game of surv so I'm making prophet and I only want one skin so I mean who cares about getting the garbage survivor skins
---
Hmm. I keep trying all these diff builds but keep going back to the same 5-7 perks for most killers...the other perks are fun but just don’t offset enough for the main ones
---
I'd much rather play against a really good nurse, then a really good doctor. 
---
It's been nerfed so it's trash, it no longer protects both people and the timer is shorter and if hit the rescuee gets Deep Wound like if Legion hit them so they prolly gunna run until they fall down once the bleedout timer ends.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Borrowed_Time 
---
No that's what I mean: only extra points from recent offerings show to other players. Extra points from BP offerings do not show to others.
---
I do allot of normal hits as legion sometimes I just close the gap with the ability then cancel it when I get into range of survivors
---
Throw at that guy all the axes that the huntress have!
---
That's a bible Dwight so I think you might have gotten memed.
---
I remember spawning there once
---
Like someone else said, you get hit for an injured survivor that is in a chase. But you also get stacks for unhooking people as well, so potentially 2 stacks from a save from a camper.
---
Half the time I forget the event, I'm having the time of my life playing peek-a-boo as Myers and confusing everyone.
---
I still do this sometimes
---
I'm new to the subreddit, I was confused why the community here hates ochido so much. Just asking because I don't know any of the details. I mean I enjoy his content sometimes and he doesn't seem like a bad person. Don't get me banned please, I love the game. I just wanted to know why he is hated so much.
---
Good perks and add ons are essential for new killers imo 
---
Some good killer perks are ruin (which you have), NOED, make your choice, bamboozle, BBQ n Chili, and Nurses Calling 
---
There’s a few more that I think are really good (frankly I think killers have WAYYYY better perk selections than survivors) so definitely grind points to use those to your advantage. NOED feels kinda cheap but if you’re not that great it can help you secure some kills at the end with cocky survivors. Prepare for those hate messages though. 
---
There’s a lot of threads already about what perks and add ons are good tho so search it up :) 
---
One thing I see killers do is loop one person around for the whole game instead of worrying about gens. Sometimes you have to realize there’s always gonna be a player who’s just better and more experienced than you and they’re gonna make you look and feel silly if you chase them and let their friends gen rush tf out of you 
---
Maps are tied to the lore of the killer.  Which is why they don't release any separately. A regular cemetary in a future chapter would be cool, and copyright free. 
---
Holy shit! If I were the Bing Bong I could not be mad at all, that was amazing!
---
Huntress's boar's head bleeds like hers, I think if they could do more they would've. It's not their property so they'd have to negotiate anything and really the SAW people should've been the ones to jump on this. His son being born during The Year of the Pig is, like, essential to why he killin.'
---
im tired of playing killer haha

Try watching some streamers, you can pick up some good strategies just by watching. The only other thing is to find someone you’re good with and keep practicing. 
---
Can always get them with the iredescent shards.
---
"Aren't you a little too short to be storm-trooper?"
---
If I recall correctly, he's some sort of streamer that's extremely toxic and has possibly been caught cheating in the past. It's been a while for me, but the extremely toxic part is the only thing I'm sure of.
---
Legion is really, really, really unfun to play against if they have the faintest idea what perks to run and how to play him. 
---
I play on PS4 to, and I should probably feel bad for survivors but I kind of don't, but I think that's because I'm just cranky and I've been burned so many times before.
---
I'd say never use them on the shrine, only cosmetics or killers
---
I can't believe killers are talking about how hard this is for them.  I'm rank 5 and it takes forever to get a queue where I go to be 4k'ed with 5 gens up and ruin totem still standing.  I didn't escape for 10 games in a row vs OP AF killers running thanataphobia, ruin, BBQ, NOED.  WE GET IT, KILLERS, YOU NEED THE 4K.

Some people still do this and it breaks my brain trying to think of why.
---
Is he the one that tunnels the survivors vs whom there is no counterplay, or is he the one that tunnels the survivors?  I forget which one he is.
---
not if you aren't are low ranks 
---
If you cancel his mori animation right before it completes he glitches like that
---
Heavily considering making video examples atm
---
The biggest problem with this game is balance, but you won't find much of a solution in an asymmetrical game because of the difficulty in balancing the game.  You would actually have to use mathematics if you wanted to balance the game.

I'm like, 90% sure you are just trolling now, but just in case...
---
Rancor is great, especially on stealth killers. Knowing where everyone is after every generator pop is very helpful. Especially in this situational moments where someone is just barely hiding from you. Then you get a free mori after powered gate.
---
Haunted Grounds works absolutely great when used alongside any other Hex perk, especially Thrill Of The Hunt.
---
I am a rank 1 killer and I use Rancor regularly. Haunted Grounds I love to bring if I bring in Devour Hope or literally just Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Not at all wasted slots.

I just double-checked from the end-game screen and downed to hooked to unhooked time shoulda been enough time for it to charge. So, I dunno maybe just an oopsie... Playing with and against a lot of survivors you see a lot of oopsies and head scratchers...
---
Am I the only person who seems to have more problems with Nea players than Claudette?
---
Yea I’ve been getting more and more frustrated playing as killer. Switched to playing survivor a lot more and it’s been surprisingly easier and more relaxing. Hell I’ve probably played half as many games and my survivor is already rank 8 and is only lvl 10. I throw all my points into killers still to get everyone’s perks teachable. Best part is I can still watch a show/movie at low volume as survivor just to hear the heartbeat.

Sure I can agree- though, personally, I don't find SWF to be a pressing issue, I know there are many people who think SWF is a problem. This would be at the bottom of my list, but it's something that is due for consideration.
---
I think incompetent teammates are a real problem when it comes to balancing gameplay, and voice chat gives that short boost to helping a newer player, such as telling them to crouch coming to unhook you against hag, or with telling people not to unhook yet etc. Small things that players do can really turn the tide of a game, and coordination with strangers to overcome an obstacle is borderline euphoric. There'd be many more skillful and risky plays with voice chat, allowing for that fulfilling gameplay.
---
If you have to mute all the players, you'd be at a significant disadvantage at the discretion of your teammates, sure, but the same thing already happens when players DC, kill themselves on hook or just refuse to play the game properly. It's going to happen either way, but a teammate who can't talk is better than no teammate at all. This one is a toss up.
---
I think a lot of post game toxicity is formed because they know they can drop a 'ggez shit teammates, meg ur gay' and leave, but in a voice chat environment people can bite back at you, and bite back hard. There aren't a lot of people, especially people who take the game seriously enough that they get to and want to keep rank 1, would sabotage their game and pips to act toxic during a match. Same goes for R6 or CSGO, if you act stupid toxic for no reason you're gonna get outed really fast via kick. In DBD, there are rules against toxicity, so not only would you be publicly crucified and sandbagged to death, you'd probably get a temporary ban.
---
In all, I believe voice chat would foster a less serious, and by extension less toxic, environment, because of the ability to make friends in game. It's really easy to get mad at someone you can't put a voice, face, or even a line of text to, because at that point they may as well be bots.
---
Same I wanna stay up all night getting cosmetics. Man that summer was fun as heck.
---
He had a large following of idiots who tried to do everything he did, so as long as he was toxic with teabagging at the gate, abusing glitches, disrespect and toxicity in post-game chat, they all followed suit.
---
This post was made by the survivor gang 
---
if you go after the same one twice in a row (hooked saved then hooked again) or for an extended period of time that's what they call "tunneling"
---
Must have paid for the outfit cos matchmaking is as dry as a desert 
---
Yeah, I'm a rank 9 survivor and I get shit on sometimes too. I need to take jokes better too I suppose, just wanting to try my luck with the other side of the game
---
Uh, that's probably as intended if they needed you to carry the team...
---
I destroyed a team as Daddy Myers but decided on a whim to let a Kate live and do gens. They were still at 5 gens when she was alive. Took her a minute to understand what was happening but all in all, I truly prefer to let one live and do gens together. Pretty wholesome stuff like that make this game fun. Also fuck this event.
---
From what I can gather, ping measures the delay incurred by the transmission time of your data.
---
In other words, a ping of 400ms means that things will be delayed by roughly half a second.
---
Pig looks like one of 'em
---
Well of course, I'm just trying to up my odds of getting back to the camp fire.
---
Nope. I mean after they fixed the initial glitch that affected everyone, it worked fine but around a day-ish later, it glitch came back. And by the looks of it, it's only affecting a select few, myself included. Like this is pissing me off a lot including when I genuinely like all the cosmetics in this event and I can't even earn the event currency to get these cosmetics. Who knows. Maybe this a tactic by BHVR to get people to buy the cosmetics with their own money. Either way this is pissing me off a lot. And after I get this Platnium trophy, which I'm 1 trophy off, I'm either quiting this game or taking a very, very long break until BHVR fixes their game. 
---
I got way harder games as killer around ranks 10-5, than I do in rank 1. Also got called garbage at mid/low ranks if I only managed 1 or 0 kills, even when it was due to me clearly playing extra nice. Like I'd go after the 4th bbq stack, rather than tunnel people for an easy death hook.
---
At rank 1 I recently got called garbage when I got a 4k, because apparently it's illegal to kill the survivors when they make a poor attempt at a sabo squad.
---
Kate is self caring
---
Do you play survivor? Cause I was a killer main, until the December update hit. Now I play Civ 6. 
---
I had the agro pretty much the whole game. Poor guy didn't know any of the mind games, ate every pallet and didn't try and break them so i was able to loop him whole game. Not to mention im pretty sure he thought he could attack while invisible. 
---
What got him banned this time?
---
yeah, killers or survivors are the most bang for your shards, cosmetics are second and maybe BBQ and Chili or another perk if you don't want the killer if it ever comes to the shrine.
---
Jeff won't let you suck his dick if you defend his company's shitty events bro

Games like Rust, CSGO and R6 Siege are pretty renowned for """community experiences""", despite being competitive (some more than others) games. There are even very successful games like Vrchat and comedy exclusively dedicated to that interactive 'talk to strangers in a game' experience.
---
As for the language barrier, just add a language preference to matchmaking. I'm sure it could be tweaked to be effective, like in other games.

I don't understand. Can someone explain? Who are these two guys?

Killer main, I've got my fourth coin too...

I've had like three matches of survivor but I did in all but one of them.

I haven't played any survivor matches, the queue is too long. &amp; I've been getting 3 and 4ks as killer and trying to get 3 hooks per person, but I'm still no where near my 3rd coin.

Like 3 or so hours. I also recently bought Kingdom Hearts 3 so I've been switching on &amp; off. I think part of it is that my matches last so goddamn long. It's like 20 minutes a match at least.

I agree wtf is this response
---
man, are you new? apart from sneaking around, entering lockers when you know for sure killer is far away(the smallest terror would be Michael in EW 2 with Dead Rabbit and Monitor and Abuse, it's 4 meters then - literally only case where you can get confused cause Rin with Beads and cloaked Wraith have very easily distinguished footsteps) or touching totems, you can just sit on one spot most of the time crouched and emote to reset the crows. 
---
well the thing is they're always technically the easy target because they've already been hooked, it's the most efficient method but it usually cripples the whole team and is less fun to play against.
---
Fans? I guess pedochido fans have been downvoted a lot.

Sometimes I try to help them escape (if I already know where the hatch is) but it's hard to get them to understand. I had one guy keep wriggling/escaping my grasp and then running *away* from the hatch. It was on Lery's too, so it wasnt exactly in a visible area. He finally understood after the third time when I clearly walked by a hook and just let me take him to it. 
---
Rest in peace TD.

Ban evasion is a possibility, though I personally think it’s unfair to ban on one platform and then ban on every other platform, but that’s just my opinion.

Barring that, he has hacked progress and items on PS4 somehow and done pretty much exactly the same shit he did on PC.

---
\*salutes\*
---
You were a good show.
---
A bit late
---
Just like Ochido
---
It does go both ways.
---
I'm not gon give up
---
What I was suggesting is if killers get to big a buff for specifically going against SWF it would make new players suffer tremendously, and now you're coming at me like I've said 'SWF is balanced'. Are you that dense and furious about what I've said that YOU would come to this conclusion?
---
And miss me with that 'you people' shit. Do you seriously think that you're better than me, or anyone else for that matter, because you completely miss my point and fail to see what anyone else is saying? Jesus you sound like a fucking PLEASURE to talk to, probably the heart of the party buddy. To think that I could post a different opinion, with zero hostility, on r/deadbydaylight with only the best of intentions. Fuck me, right? Bottom line, you're genuinely stupid if you missed my point *that badly* and hammered out a comment acting like a fucking saint.
---
For the record, I mained nurse for a few months about a year ago and found it stupid easy. Still do find it stupid easy, because low rank survivors are too weak.
---
It's also obvious that you've never once played survivor.
---
uH UH Uh UhHHhhH Kay shut it we heard enough from you already.
---
BREAKING NEWS: Killers attempt to kill all of the survivors! More at 11!
---
If I let anyone have hatch I'll try to go to a hook and hit it with my weapon then walk away. Most tend to understand that. 
---
There's a difference between the top 3 of Nurse, Billy, Huntress, and the viable killers in high ranks. Myers, Hag, Clown and Spirit are all perfectly usable in high ranks.
---
Just a thought.
---
[ YOU'RE A SURVIVOR! ]
---
lmao aww you little triggered piece of shit
---
lmfao i so love this
---
I used to do this and me and a friend got "swf" just by queuing 50 times at rank 20 haha.
---
I got it because of a farming killer lol
---
The actual event is fine,but the lobbies aren't 
---
This is an old screen they've been testing for a few years
---
THIS! THIS EXACTLY
---
yeah, I was just asking out of curiositiy :)
---
personally, I just let the killer kill me and that's it. I can understand farming when you need points, but at a certain point (you'll understand me since you have legacy) you just want to have fun on the game.. and farming is not funny obviously
---
Your going to get banned if you keep dcing
---
any of mine? I feel like slenderman and a scarescrow won't be added.
---
Pennywise is a no because he has no powers.
---
You know that's Scott right?
---
"that file is safe, which contains only the graphics fps settings, but things like game icons etc from other folder, is what gets you banned if EAC detected it."
---
Yeah but I can understand no-one wants to play against P3 Claudette’s and Shadow Adam’s
---
Who said this?
---
Run whispers 
---
Yeah I have basically everything I need with 4,000+ hours on this game so farming really isn't my thing I just want to sacrifice you to the entity and move. I don't wanna babysit survivors for the 5 gens they have to do. 
---
disabling v-sync is a good idea but uncapping fps caused some problems with latest updates where people couldn't leave basement or would get stuck on a hook/behind gates. 
---
literature the day they brought the patch that fixed the basement bug got me stuck on a hook for a whole match. no one could get me, the hook was even sabotaged while I was on it. killer basically stuck with me on his shoulder but not like DC flex thing. you couldn't see him flex but he couldn't perform any actions of breaking pallets or kicking gens or picking up survivors. I had to DC in order to leave the map and release the killer. and it's all because killer's FPS was uncapped. 
---
i like my bird with a pinch of salt
---
And why do you think that is? Nobody wants to play killer because of the points they get, and then when you do get into a match you get a killer that DC's, tunnels, or camps. I understand they were trying to add something new, but for me and many others it just doesn't make the event "fine" or fun, but that's just my opinion ig
---
Same here, escaped with a vessel through the hatch and got nothing.
---
nope go play friday

well if you get max points as survivor its only 100 games.

Killers dont want to play swf lobbys, why cuz you never make it to the fucking lamp after hooking someone before it gets nabbed.

Good luck tho

---
GOD. RIGHT. Earlier I hooked someone and I was IN FRONT OF THE LAMP and while I was in the hooking animation this dude walked up and grabbed it. Then teabagged me after a pallet when I chased him. I ended up disconnecting because I had just gone through like 5 matches of that shit, and I went to the match details page &amp; sure enough, as I expected, it was a red rank that was teamed up with their low rank friend to get into my easy killer lobby.
---
I'm so tired of that, haha. Don't game the system to come to my shit rank killer lobby, take the lamp under my face and then teabag me all match when I was the only one who played an offering for the stupid lamps you're all carrying around &amp; teabagging with.
---
you can tell it's not swf when people constantly leave the lobby and new join. I'm killer main, I could tell when you might assume it's swf. the 40% of dodges is my view on cases where there's literally no way to think it's swf. 
---
and I don't know how bad can someone be on rank 1 to dodge the lobby because someone has bright clothes/hair which literally makes them more visible everywhere and helps you a bunch in chase or patrolling. I'd think some could be that boosted and assume any bright character is toxic/good but not that amount. 
---
So no to Pennywise since that is itself an Eldritch being. Also no to Yeti, Werewolf, and Scarecrow since all killers are human and I don't see that changing. I have no clue who the Jester is, Alma is more a psychological threat than anything physical, and I think Slenderman's time is done. The only one I see working is a vampire, it just won't be Dracula specifically.
---
Oh I don’t mind, being critical isn’t mean :)
---
Yeah, it's the toxic thing. People assume that people with the bright cosmetics are the runners/loopers. Like, I personally don't care unless they also come with a flashlight, then I'm like, **TRIGGERED**
---
From what I read, it's cumulative hours rather than in one session. So if you have 500+ hours total in DBD on OLED, could be risky
---
I don’t mind playing SWF. But if you come in with four flashlights or four toolboxes, I’ll probably dip if I’m playing a killer without Franklin’s. 
---
But yeah, I’ve been dodged so much as survivor lately. Even if we all come in solo with no items. And usually not obnoxious cosmetics either. 
---
What! How! what is your secret?!
---
But it’s not just for them. It’s boring to just gen rush and not get to do anything else all game. You probably won’t pop from that either. 
---
Haha! I'd have survivors say that's an exploit before, like what?! Good on you, friend. 
---
It’s a good idea, but aura-reading the survivor that managed to escape a chase kind of makes it difficult to ever outplay/escape the killer since he can see where you went for a couple of seconds?
---
I think it's kind of a 'business partners' type of deal between Freddy and the Entity. Freddy gives the Entity its sacrifices like usual, but I can't think of what the Entity would be offering that Freddy doesn't already have or can make himself. Freddy isn't the type of character to do something for others without there being something in it for him.
---
Oh wow forgot to put it in, but there’s a limit of 4 tokens 
---
I'm not playing swf, just a basic dwight (only because I have two dwight dailies). Also I've destroyed a fair amount of vessels as a killer. You win some, you lose some. It's just annoying that the lobbies are getting cancelled way more than usual today 
---
cheesus, fam. for real? I'm playing on rank 1 and have no courtesy of dodging a lobby if I see one random with pink hair to join. on the contrary, I do enjoy even swfs with bright clothing. what I'd dodge is 4 p3 Megs/Claudettes/Shadow Adams cause they most likely used some dark map offering and Iron Will.
---
also, how do flashlights bother you? to me it's like maybe annoying second when they blind me by pallets but that's about it. just down people strategically and be aware of their buddies with flashlights around. smack them and face away while picking someone up or if you see a flashlight pointing at you just spam "r"(drop the survivor). I mean as Hag or Wraith that might be annoying. just use Frankie's :D and as Hag trap the flashlights lol.
---
?
---
I’ve never heard of anyone having an issue. As long as your screen sees a variety of images (like playing other games) it should be okay. 
---
The event queues are crazy. Survivors used to trickle in over 30 seconds to a minute. Now it's always within 10 seconds, which probably looks like swf to them. (I've had my friend join a lobby a whopping 15 seconds after me before because of lag or something so joining sort of separately doesn't necessarily disprove SWF)
---
Because you are trash?
---
Pc
---
Everytime i purchase something like auric cell packs whether it be with auric cells or actual money the game pretends like i no longer own any dlc character or any cosmetics for them. Fixes by resetting the game but it happens everytime and scared the hell out of me first time

No... no it’s not...
---
I wouldn't be able to resist not killing it xD
---
Camping isn’t directly punished, but killers can lose progress towards ranking up if they camp too much in a match. Doesn’t seem to bother the hardcore campers though. 
---
I like survivors with bright cosmetics, even if they're swf. Usually my main issue isn't chasing survivors, it's finding them when they sneak and hide in a dark corner all match 
---
The basic explanation is that they lose all sense empathy and go back he their primal instincts, fight or flight. And because they have all committed murders before (except Spirit which is another story) their instincts become fight. For some killers like Hag maybe she's just hungry but killing and eating the survivors doesn't cleanse her hunger. But this doesn't work for all killers, Wraith for example, he killed his boss out of revenge and vanished.
---
My survive with friends are the rank ones and the rank eight. We were so confused and thought the killer was trying to farm, we gave him compliments and told him not to give up once we realized.
---
Thats so messed up, happened to me today where my swf of rank 1s got a rank 20 killer brand new to the game.
---
Playing Myers without Ruin makes me sad. And because of that it's completely up to RNG how well you do with him. Survivors can stall Myers for so long from getting EW2 that it usually costs a gen or ruin for him.
---
Yes, but the event goes on until the 13th. It has been 3 days. You have plenty of time. 
---
I think this creates more problems then it solves
---
It's peer to peer, the lost connection to host is the killer quitting the lobby.
---
&amp; there's an event going on right now that rewards playing survivor more than killer, so no one is playing killer.
---
Gen rushing without being hooked and escaping is a pip. Not to mention if you just go in proximity of the killer you get some bold points.
---
Probably true. I get rank 13 survivors as rank 2 killer, and every lobby will bring at least 1 red ping guy.
---
Yeah... Also remember what pallets were? Or that one unknown perk called saboteur.
---
Had 3 dodges in a row and honestly I feel its just cus we joined at the same time. Got kicked and rejoined. 2 people from the last room are there too, kicked again. Try again with same result of same 2 people with kick. Ended up stepping away after that.
---
I got bullied so hard in the past.And then i bought legion.My time to bully boi
---
Just play SWF and join the DBD discord, it's basically the same like playing with randoms if you play with new people all the time. And as I see it if you are playing with randoms or solo you are handicapping yourself, you know you are going into a game that will be harder and teamplay will also be hard. So just go play SWF.
---
How many downvotes i will get?
---
I already adressed this statement while replying  to another comment, aimlessly wandering around the map with a hope of maybe finding something worth doing is more than counterintuitive to what PT does. You dont take a perk specifically designed to help you with generators  simply to not do them after one or two are done.
---
DS, SC, lithe/balanced landing, Dance with me /adrenaline
---
When you know you've lost. Go stand in the basement or something and afk. 95% of the time one or two will come get curious and more often than not you can catch them on the way back to the exit and get an easy free hook. Hiding NOED at the end of the game and such.
---
Don't forget. You haven't lost until they actually leave. Slugging is viable because survivors are dumb and can't resist trying to save thier teammates.
---
Cause I actually like this killer, not Billy. Just my preference :)
---
Pardon? Would you care to explain your statement?
---
Legions power is boring. Basically that's it. It gives the killer the power to vault over things and run faster. You won't win a chase against Legion. But you won't win a chase against Nurse either but people claim "its ok because at least Nurse's power takes some skill" which I would disagree with to certain degree.
---
I had a situation where someone was hooked and I knew someone was on the other side of the wall behind them (I was playing doctor so I could shock them to find them) and the person on the hook assumed I was camping them and shocking them but in reality I was trying to get the person behind the wall
---
Play till a million bp and then spend it? lol its what I always do
---
Accusing survivors of being a swf group is typical of bad killers 
---
yes of course! I have some better (hopefully higher res) versions that I posted on imgur, and I posted the link on a separate post I made, so feel free to use those as well! 
---
I play Hag a lot &amp; I only have about two weeks into killer, so I don't have Franklin's. I also had a really shit experience with a player who somehow figured out a way in my first few days of playing to just like, continuously blind me every time that my blind wore off, even though I rotated/etc to get away from it, and now I'm very anti-flashlight.
---
Ugh that's fair. I keep finding Claudette's hiding in dark corners now that the event has those lamp sparkles.
---
I want to say it was touched on during a broadcast that the killers did not inflict this damage to themselves and was part of the torture. Like the metal coming from trappers arm or doctors eyes and body wires.
---
aaaah thank you so much! I hope they like it as much as you? And yes I do plan on getting a killer version done, perhaps in the coming weeks while I juggle Uni and work :D 
---
This trash meg still talking when her entire swf group got downed by a pig with 2 level 1 perks. I'm flaggerbasted
---
 If you read this "terror meg" believe me you are the baddie.
---
Iridescent Lightbringer is 4 points
---
Iridescent Unbroken is 4
---
That’s only 8, which is a safety pip. You’d have to do something in Evader and Benevolent too. 
---
Yeah, this has happened to me a few times today. It's why I stopped playing for now &amp; moved onto a new game.
---
We should just ban people who DC too much. Or do what dota 2 does and make them play, TO COMPLETION, a number of "Low Priority" games, games that take forever to queue in, are laggy as fuck, and have other DCers in the lobby with you. So basically make them play more DBD.
---
Did you use you’re “cellphone” to take a pic? Joking too.
---
you all have crabs?
---
u think this is toxic? whatsup with this community being so fragile that they think ingame mechanics are toxic lol
---
Oh, that will definitely be something worth doing! I'll see if I can squeeze that into my busy schedule :D 
---
If you play SWF you kick other surv to your friend farm bp
---
Getting stuff for free... by playing a game... that we paid $30 for??? The nerve of people to expect that.
---
Thank you for the perk suggestion! 
---
/u/HeWhoWasDead
---
I had that perk i forgot what it was called where the other survivors can see each other while i'm on the hook. Yeah they still do gens
---
&gt;This event is such a shitshow for survivors
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
[Aye here it is](https://imgur.com/gallery/6HmiEWD)
---
People who play like you obviously.
---
Send nudes Nurse you cheater
---
thank you :D
---
It took me 3 games to get my hit 4 people with frenzy daily today. Because the first game they DCed as soon as the first survivor saw me, second game they DCd after the first hit, then the third game I finally was able to get my deep wounds off on them. It sucked
---
I made this low effort shitpost in my very first match against her back when she came out. Didn't know anything about countering her at the time :)
---
I run brutal strength because I remember the days when you needed Brutal Strength, Enduring and Iron Grasp to have any hope as killer, and now I've just gotten used to it.
---
And if not, it's probably a group of adults and one day they'll become elderly. 
---
This is a good idea, but as I mentioned, with the frequency of Infinite loads and shitty internet, that may punish innocent players more
---
The way I look at it: if you don't use an endgame perk because you won, you didn't need a different perk anyway.
---
I usually have killed them all at that point, or they've escaped.
---
Yeah I've given up. Just playing killer now 
---
And then they made muppet babies TD style. Does everything good always have to be ruined by a babies version? I also miss Sixteen. Was a fun show.
---
This is the jester and they're a human someone made this
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9ets0j/yet_another_chapter_concept_to_add_to_the_pile/
---
Until the killer in your lobby glitch comes back
---
I remember the days of Brutal Strength, Unrelenting, Iron Grasp, Whispers being meta a/f
---
Then what's leatherface doing in game as well as Michael myers e.c.t.
---
I didn't know there was a nea skin for legion. 
---
Definetely if you liked the game
---
The whole show is on Netflix last I checked.
---
Does this work on PC? Does the killer notice it? I want to do that!
---
&gt;saboteur
---
[STOP.](/intensifies)
---
To this day my heart skips a beat when I see Jake Parks holding a toolbox.
---
Barely anyone seems to know how little Prove Thyself does. When you solo a Gen it's 80 seconds but when you are 2 people on a Gen it takes roughly 44 seconds. With Prove Thyself equipped it drops it to 40.
---
So at that point it is no faster than 2 people working solo on diFFerent Gens.
---
Obviously not constantly, just until they get to a point that feels good enough to stick with.
---
Dude i remember watching that at a doctors office my first thoughts were "where is the crude jokes, the constant brushes of death and the disgusting moments!?" 
---
Then i remembered the dogfood scene in the orginal total drama and I ended up gagging for more than a bit XD
---
And let's not forget that every girl was thicc. Like did Sir Mixalot design the girls?
---
Holy fuck you’re triggered about this. Get good you fucking scrub
---
This used to happen so much in the early days of the game and then the Devs changed it. Now it's back again and is a huge pain in the ass.
---
I'm a survivor and I'll make it out alive no matter what! Succ my nuts entity! 
---
I think that was just the style of the show, but yeah questions about design my dude.
---
I actually really like this idea
---
Who here remembers machinegun Myers?
---
Or when Trapper could trap under hooks?
---
Or when people thought Wraith was the best killer?
---
Or when Autohaven was so bad it was grounds for DCing if you were a killer?
---
Or when Sprint Burst came back mid-chase?
---
Or when you had to run Brutal Strength, Iron Grasp and Enduring to have a chance at killer?
---
Or 4 BNP SWF squads?
---
Or infinites?
---
Or when killer could literally just stand in front of the hook and go AFK and you couldn't save at all?
---
Or when D-strike could be played on 4 survivors?
---
Where did the time go?
---
“The killer now has it easy” lol
---
I meant that when he was showcasing Ace’s outfit, he accidentally called the outfit was for David
---
you just needed to look up though.
---
Hold it down longer
---
If they are swf you shouldn't care about what they screech in post game chat. You'll be called a camper unless you don't leave the hook 0.0001 miliseconds after putting somebody there anyway
---
This specifically only happens when I charge my blinks fully 
---
That's because it's not a triangle it's an ochidogon smh
---
Actually the event is very buggy, at least twice already I've received 45 points after dying.
---
Man. I have a hard time finding the super urban evasion-y immersed survivors. Sometimes I get stuck having to patrol 3 gens that they've barely touched for like 5+ minutes.
---
Cheers! 🥂
---
The first videos were even fun to watch and new, and he featured other players, but after some it was just about him being toxic or how "great" he was at juking- ofc it only featured his good moments mostly and wasn't self deprecating at all, so it did get stale ofc.
---
i don’t understand why they can’t give us all more points? people who genuinely enjoy the game will keep playing it because each time you use an item it goes away (unless you escape with it) and so say you run out of batteries and flashlights, you’re still going to go through the bloodweb and find more even if you’ve P3’d every character. they need to give more BP’s. 15k when i did 3 gens, unhooked 2 people &amp; opened a door AND escaped? ok 
---
Uhhh looking down or dead zones
---
Or saboteur breaking every hook on the entire map?
---
You must've had bad ping or something that's probably why they left lol
---
Please fix this bug, it’s so annoying to have a leave a lobby after waiting forever. And you aren’t sure if it’s bugged or if someone just hasn’t joined yet. It fixes itself if someone leaves but that’s the only way. 
---
Unlikely but possibly hurt. 
---
Think it's one of those doors you see in store cold-rooms, which are not heavy. The rubber on the edges are meant to seal and separate the airspace between main store and cold-room, meaning the door itself does not need to exert heavy pressure to seal the room. The doors don't close with any considerable amount of force and they most likely have sensors which notice if there is an obstruction most probably because the store could have things like small children running about who don't exactly notice or understand the concept of automated door. You can also see that the door brakes and slows down towards the end, not because its detecting obstruction but because it is programmed to do so. Hence there is logic in it and pretty safe to presume that the safety has also been considered while engineering it and that door is working as I described.
---
And Nick Castle is ?
---
So true. One time I accidentally sandbagged my brother and he got so mad he changed his name to "please kill jody" cause it's my name lol
---
I think you're missing the point
---
infinite loading is a problem the devs need to fix.
---
having shitty internet isn't. And once we get dedicated servers Soon^tm, there will be no excuse.
---
and it’s the same for killers. if they want the beads for spirit or the pinky finger for clown or muffler for billy they will keep having to play to get blood points to go through the web. it’s not going to hinder anyone from playing. low blood point retention is though
---
I'm pretty trash myself and this BS behavior keeps me from trying to get better. I'm not sure why it bothers me so much but I get so discouraged. When I play survivor I always just try to respect the killer. 
---
Also does the perk activate when the last gen is powered or is it just static throughout the game
---
Not enough killers, play as killer.
---
Here to remind everyone: It probably isn't the hitbox but the latency. Or more likely than anything, both the hitbox and the latency.
---
Last one who tried wound up with a bunch of hooks in them (trapper)
---
[FUCKING JAKE PARKS ASS BITCH MAKING ME SLUG EVERYONE IN THE GAME LOOK AT THIS CANDY ASS BITCH WITH HIS SHITTY GREEN PARKA HE CAN SHOVE THAT TOOLBOX UP HIS ASS I BET HE SMELLS LIKE SHIT BECAUSE HE SURE FUCKING DOESN'T GET INVITED TO PARTIES EXCEPT BY HIS SWF BUTTBUDDIES WHO ALSO BREAK HOOKS I BET THEY JUST HAVE A GRAND OLD HOOK BREAKING CLUB OVER THERE BREAKING HOOKS MOTHERFUCKERS HOLY SHIT I'M STILL MAD.](/intensifies)
---
people already get banned for DC'ing too much 
---
At least you can avoid hatchets 3 times before Huntress has to rearm. Nurse just keeps blinking forever.
---
A human jester is fine. 
---
For me the Event is over... Played as Killer... All disconnect if u Got them...
---
As survivor? 7 from 8 Matches Camping?!?
---
So... Play again After the Event... Maybe
---
That's a Pizza Dwight! They're innocent souls. It pisses me off when I see a toxic Pizza Dwight such as this one.
---
What? Ace cosmetic is the best, Feng's cosmetic is uninspired and boring and Huntress is lame.
---
Update kinda screwed the nurse by making more dead zones (areas you can't blink through)
---
exhaustion (common) and oak haft 
---
&gt; Feng's cosmetic is the best of the event by far.
---
yeah, I guess if you want that "hostess at a PF Changs" look. 
---
You are referring to the setbacks both survivors and killers face from disconnecting yes? Like when a survivor disconnects and how the killer gets no BP for that survivor but when a killer disconnects and the survivors keep their remaining BP for that match?

It’s a KYF glitch that lets you have multiple killers (as well as multiple survivors). 
---
you mean you had your skill check button bound to space for 2k hours? I changed mine to F when I had like 400 hours 
---
Whenever i start playing a killer i haven't played before i watch some youtube videos from Monto or Tru3Ta1ent playing that killer. They usually explain what they're doing and show different playstyles. Monto shows you his killer loadout at the start of each video explaining why he's running it which can really help out.
---
Not sure if that is what you're looking for but watching these guys improved my killer play a lot.
---
I usually just search "dbd (insert killer)" on youtube and any one of their videos should pop up.
---
4000 hours on this game.. I would understand that for something more complex and competetitive like Starcraft, DOTA or League but this? 
---
I think it’s best I stick to the trusty billy boy/bing bong
---
killer buffs yes. killer is brain dead easy atm, meanwhile survivor actually takes a lot of skill
---
Pause the game from time-to-time. That dims the UI behind it and should prevent screen burn.
---
That said, I believe screen burn is very unlikely with modern OLED displays.
---
Yeah, I like to run bbq, sloppy, nurse's calling and monitor on Michael. Helps to know where they are fairly often.

Geting smacked with the Legion while he starts a frenzy has a chance to bug his animation so when he goes into frenzy he doesn't raise his weapon or his hand.

Survivors do this for 2 reasons:

1- wait to see if nobody Will be hooked so they can save
---
2- mess up with u

Check that guide out and do what you can to apply what's there. You'll find that Freddy isn't in fact that bad and when played to his actual strengths he has more going for him than some of the other killers.
---
🦀🦀🦀 OCHIDO IS GONE 🦀🦀🦀
---
Ruin, NOED, Iri+Infantry Belt, Ebony Mori... Hmmm, I wonder why survivor isn't fun anymore 
---
The game is just very fun and friends make it even better. It's a long grind to get everything but no one would go through it if the game wasn't fun. 
---
Oh I've tried it. It doesn't work very well, at least not as a surefire thing as most people here claim.
---
thank you, its not my art though, i forced my autistic brother to draw it. he cried the entire time, but its okay because no one heard him :D!
---
lol it makes the game unplayable cause lobbies take 300 years what are you on about mate.
---
Thanks bud!
---
He's the most obnoxious, biased killer-main I have ever seen on this sub
---
I think I'll go with "bqq is actually really bad".
---
Seems like a solid deflection, thanks.
---
The hypocrisy is part of the joke.
---
There is, you need to put more effort and be better 
---
That is hitting him actually with a pallet so he loses whole frenzy and you use fact he is 110% as well as jumping windows (going behind, either actually jumping back or pretending to do so, both can work)
---
When I first started playing in December 2017, I saw his vids and thought they were pretty funny. As I became more experienced with the game and found other content creators, I realised that his videos are nothing more than average plays with ear rape slapped on. His videos are funny to children and new players. Once you realise that 90% of what you see in his videos are what you see happen in average games, they become less funny and more cringy, never mind the pedophile allegations and exploit Sharing/ban evading and overall douchy behaviour which has die hard fans are now emulating. He’s the worst kind of influence for the DBD community so I’m glad to see he’s gone.
---
Then those who saved don't know how to do it.
---
Thing number 153 that shouldn't be in the game.

Screen burn looks pretty bad after 5 weeks @ 20hours a day with static content on LG C6. And is visible earlier to a lesser extent. 5weeks at 20hours a day is 700hours
---
oh i see thanks, must be to mess with me since they were the only ones alive at exit
---
It really isn't though, there's been plenty of times where I'm not near a locker or generator. And the whole go in one direction and then in another after 4 sec is bogus as well as most pair it with whispers and will just find you if you stay, as you can't move for shit in the additional 5 seconds it takes for the killer to get to you.
---
He’s sleeping off the drink, no worries 
---
Claim your freedom
---
It's like

"Haha i won see how funny I am?"

I’m glad someone else asked.
---
This is almost too perfect.
---
If I’m running play with your food and I hit my obsession then yes 
---
Especially with two rank 2 survivors going against a rank 11 killer. Only reasonable explanation 
---
No it’s worse then before
---
I have 1 bp
---
Just chase unless they use Lithe or Balanced Landing, then you cloak to catch up. As a survivor I usually let the killer hit me out if I'm the first one, a little trick to reveal NOED to the rest
---
D-Strike, Dead Hard + Sprint Burst... Hmmm, I wonder why killer isn’t fun anymore
---
Intentionally designed to get you to buy at least once outfit. Jokes on them, people only really want the Huntress and Feng outfit. The head for Ace is decent. 
---
Exhaustion got nerfed so SB isn't that strong anymore, Dead Hard can be easily countered, and DS can also be easily countered by slugging/dribbling/using enduring
---
behvr spend all their money getting them, rather than putting that money to use fixing the game \^\_\^ 
---
Even something like hold right mouse to refuse. Sure some may troll but lot better than getting taken back down not even 5 secs later and put back up.
---
I found that by looking up a bit before releasing the blink it reduced this happening to me. But I'm still garbage with nurse.

Don't Sweat It: You can perform actions while downed. When you change health states, gain a 5% increase to action speed for 20 seconds.

The token penalties activate as the last gen pops
---
only logical explanation is they wanted that 4-man escape hatch achievement losing it resulted in DCx4 
---
Haha you accidentally left me on read
---
Sure that's true. But I'm simply stating that if you're out for points alone, you will want to do more than just gens. Especially with PT.
---
So if you're maxed on points, you can either do more gens or go take up other "duties" allowing your teammates to also go get points or survive. A gen jockey build is okay, but if you're trying to use it to get points I think you should diversify your actions.

I played with a nea once that was working with the killer, i guess nea is the killer meme didnt come out of thin air.

This is a side effect of old ez 4k route known as lagswitch. I saw exactly same thing yesterday

I honestly find a good amount of the Funny Random Moments entertaining because for some reason my brain finds earrape funny, but it ended up getting to me just the fact that it was the same mediocre plays with music added over it.

Bless, I thought I was the only one.
---
underrated comment
---
But you can, just look at the grass
---
You also get barely any extra BPs during this event, at least compared to the last 3 events.. They really done fucked this up 
---
I use it fpr failing as leatherface. I just tell them Bubba is retarded and im roleplaying...heh yeah, roleplaying :D haha
---
Entity.
---
Seriously in dbd if you cant explain shit or theres a plothole, its just the Entity my dude. Sooner you accept that the better.
---
The killers abilities reflect the players skills. Change my mind. 
---
Play leatherface with insidious and basement build :) its easy game when you get one of them. Then YOU can tell them that they are bad because they got caught :)))))
---
Its the cost of being hip.
---
Can't kill with the knife than just kill it in fashion.
---
I'm not getting into any lobbies at all playing as killer or survivor... no one joins as killer and there's no lobbies when I search for one as survivor... I wait a solid 20 mins and nothing

Everyone has differing opinions on this I guess LOL I love the ace and huntress one and don’t really like fengs....
---
4swfdc &gt; 4k
---
I have definitely seen some toxic Claudettes, but at least they've tried to help me usually. But Dwights.. they always leave everyone on the hook, lure the survivor to me while being chased and in general just let others always open the exit gate and do all the work etc
---
If someone is failur? What it mean? 
---
yeah, I found the first ones funny too, especially the flying wraith got me laughing more than I want to admit xD but yeah, after a while it was getting stale, not much new stuff. Btw, I really like Ochidos "story vids", with dwight at haddonfield. Like, he got some talent, but at the same time, he's an impossible toxic player. I admit, I didn't watch the new vids of him, because I didn't have it in me to go through his videos in the hope to find a good sequence, so it might be hypocritical to judge him for it, but yeah, it was getting old.
---
I only want 3 parts in total so 3 coins is all I need. Not a grind at all for me.
---
Huntress body looks good with the bear head. Ace pants looks great with either of his red robes/smoking jackets, the next P3 Claudette for stealth in my opinion. And Feng head fits with just about anything.
---
Fashion for me is mix/matching cosmetics. Be unique and make a look. Using full sets just feels too simple.
---
nea's  bring a flashlight but won't call you a cunt
---
Go check. You normally get 1250 for quitter bonus and now its down to 625. Same for no one escapes.
---
I'll check later on but that sucks bollocks.
---
Don't forget to mention that he used clips from Tru3ta1ent in the wrong context making him seem dumb or bad. He also didn't ask him for the clips and just took them without his permission. 
---
You just asked for information, theres no way thats bannable my friend
---
 🦀 OBAMA IS GONE 🦀 
---
What about survivors being completely invincible for 7 seconds at the start of every chase? 
---
That hit in the smoke shack was rather good. Need to keep note of that one. 
---
At the risk of looking a fool is missed, you can deal damage while setting up for a near instant follow through as they jump that window. 
---
Malaysia servers to queue snipe your friends before they implemented SWF. Good times
---
I don't think you can get Freddy with cells unfortunately.
---
If you want to make your killers stronger, I'd recommend Hag to get Ruin. I find her pretty fun to play as well. 
---
Yikes
---
You forgot the most important part:
---
Spamming Wraith Bell on a hooked survivor to farm points.
---
Also Hillbilly being considered the worst of the three killers
---
This is why I usually dip out when I see that fucking Dweasel on survivor lobby if I have a survivor daily.
---
Thankfully I’m a killer main. In the past, I let them fuck up their team mates first before I kill them. But now, I *always* kill them first. No more mercy. I know how it feels to be sandbagged like this. Fucking assholes.
---
You can buy legion with shards, don’t use cells. And freddy will hopefully get a rework. Even if he doesn’t I think if you really like him you should buy him. 
---
They claimed to have changed and fixed it with the pallet overhaul patch. Remember when they lowered how many hooks and how many pallets spawn? The default number used to be higher. They lowered the number and tried to make it so pallets and hooks were more spread out evenly so that the stacking wouldn't happen and the cause sections to have nothing. The hooks still spawn too close together, and there's usually only one section of the map that has little to no hooks nearby. But that's easily fixed by offerings, and Perks for a killer. 
---
Pallets however, they significantly lowered how many pallets there used to be, and now the RNG keeps spawning them wrong. Entire open sections on maps with not a single pallet to use. Killers are faster than Survivors so of course it's easy to catch up. And now everyone can 360, and not every killer can be 360'ed. Especially on console when it's harder to do so. 
---
What they did was make so that whole the play field is loading, the pallets all spawn a certain distance from each other first, then once it can no longer spawn them that distance from each other it randomly stacks them in other places. But it doesn't work properly because like I said, I always see all the pallets stacked in one area and that's it. They should either restore the number of pallets we used to have, or fix the damn RNG already. 
---
And before I get that person that tells me "get good": I used to loop killers around pallets for entire games if I had to. And that was possible because I had pallets, t-walls (which also spawn weird now) and jungle gyms to use. That overhaul fucked it up and it's become much harder to stay up for a long time. These days you can't really loop a killer a lot of the time and only because of the RNG. Especially when you have idiot survivors wasting the few pallets you do have! 
---
And I want to be clear. It's not that I want to be toxic and be able to loop a killer the whole game. I want balance. Killer get things like bloodlust, and some killers literally use bloodlust as their main strategy to get their kills. That's where "bloodlust killers" comes from. Bloodlust may might be great, but it's literally a free extra perk killers get to help them combat being looped. Survivors get what? A mini sprint burst when they get hit that usually makes them collide with other objects anyways so they don't even get to sprint away? Taking away multiple defense points for a helpless character is not balanced. Add multiple nerfs to things like healing, generator repairs (until a few days ago I didn't know that you get a repair debuff when multiple survivors are on one generator now. Did you? Yeah that's a thing now apparently) etc. and how is that fair? I'm sick of killers being able to complain and get everything they ask for, but fuck survivors. I play both sides, it's difficult for both sides in certain situations, I get that. But the Devs have continuously shown they are not capable or remaining neutral and providing true balance. And it's infuriating. 
---
Just checked, you can get Freddy with cells, I tried hag but didn’t do too well. Maybe if I use her more.
---
Thank you for your input, and it will help me with deciding
---
I remember all of it. Sprint burst used to be 20 seconds...
---
It's pretty common if 1 DC's the others follow since they wanna play another game together. 
---
Which you tend to get no matter what by being near other survivors/the killer. It's absurdly easy to pip in the game. I just feel I shouldn't be punished for the killer farming, hence no DC. Even a safety is better than that.
---
How long would it take to farm that many shards? I already have 399 from like a few days of playing on and off
---
And all my addons and perks can be countered by not dying 
---
Freddy is underpowered but fun as hell
---
Honestly I do it as a meme but I know o e of my friends do it as a habit.
---
Alright I think I’m gonna have to get him.
---
Pedo life here I come!
---
Yea he's all i use and still get pretty consistent 4ks, only up to like rank 13 though 
---
I'm new to the dbd community. What's the dwight stuff?
---
Ah I was thinking of shards, my bad.
---
Well I say get the killers you find fun then, Freddy is one of my favourites despite his weaknesses. 
---
He was the worst because he had nothing to counter infinites 
---
Yea I’m definitely getting Freddy, hope he gets a buff.
---
How is legion? Are they a decent killer and kinda balanced?
---
Pig and myers
---
shirtless myers
---
enough said....
---
Many of them are either cowards who hide in lockers, completely useless, or toxic as fuck to killers or as above, to their fellow survivors.
---
What perks do you use? And do you main the clown?
---
No dude you just have to get the right timing: it works like a flashlight save :) 
---
I’ve though about Myers, and I have enough cells for one more (decided on Freddy because of this wonderful community’s help)
---
How is the pig? OP or underpowered?
---
So they just buffed this perk massively and added a bp multiplier to it.. And now you want them to just double the multiplier? Seems pretty silly
---
How is that not DBD related? It looks exactly like the current event laterns..
---
Personally I don't find them very fun, and they're pretty meh without their good purple addons.
---
The Spirit is a somewhat similar killer that I personally find a lot more fun. She has some decent perks as well. 
---
He got 3 chances on PC and couldn't behave, it's as simple as that. If you don't behave after getting 3 chances, you don't deserve a new chance.
---
I wasnt even mad, I just got so suprised. A for effort to piggie
---
Why is that related to dwight though?
---
With the Console bans active, the Devs could if they really wanted to.
---
You dont get them for free , you pay around 7€ to get the base game on pc 
---
I completely forgot she existed and I have made my decision.
---
The spirit. 
---
Thank you so much for this, I was gonna be stuck here forever.
---
Try getting hit before you drop it. The weapon cooldown locks them into the perfect spot to blind them. 
---
Glad I could help :)
---
Happy killing! 
---
I have 1700 hours and no screen burn. It's very rare so don't stress
---
He uses clips from games in the wrong context all the time, you could tell way before the whole Tru3 thing. 
---
I remember he kept putting clips of himself doing 'ninja unhooks' into his montages, and he made it seem like him hook farming a teammate was a skilled play because he didn't add in the part where his teammate would get downed and hooked again 2 seconds later.
---
I hate to tell you this, but as a survivor I laugh my ass off when a salty killer decides to DC.
---
It's like saying I would prefer quick and painless death compared to insane torture.
---
Yeah purple is the land of deranking survivors so you get some rough games.
---
On console it is a serious issue. We don't have the ability to change controls, and interaction is all based on one button. Healing, vaulting, repairing, chest searching, etc. 
---
Couldn't tell you many times I've been close to picking. A downed teammate who's fully recovered up, but fast vaulted a window 3,000 times instead. Or thrown a pallet. Or repaired a gen. Or opened a chest. And it usually results in mine and their death. 
---
Tips:
---
1: Don't ask what you should buy as it is very subjective, everyone has a different opinion. Instead buy what you want to play.
---
2. Just cause people say a killer is under powered doesn't mean they are. I've been playing Freddy for roughly 700 hours and i have no problems getting kills or ranking up.
---
3. &gt; Please help I’m horrible at making decisions.
---
There is no right or wrong option, just get what you want to play.
---
4. Check the perks you get with the killer not only the killers power. Freddy may be considered weak but he comes with pretty good perks, but so does Legion.
---
It couldn't have. Pay more attention to what the barrier looks like at the start. It definitely isn't heavy or metallic. 
---
You wrote "then" instead of "than" 
---
Another person who doesn't know how to play Freddy effectively, very cool.
---
I have 1.5k hours lmao. I've definitely done something like this before 
---
Who ever said i wanted the multiplier to be doubled? As i already stated in another comment i suggest to remove the current bonus and add one post trial, your ignorance seems pretty silly
---
I think I saw you and your friends go against Morf the other day. He was a mint rag Hag on one of the swamp maps and it was a really fun game to see. 
---
I stood 1m in front of the killer and even got the  "killer blind" points. She didn't drop the surv though 
---
The dumbass ones are usually because Dwight is one of the few available survivors available to them.
---
The tryhard ones are the ones who are into him and want to show off how much better they are now as Dwight than they used to.
---
The toxic ones are the ones who wanted to do stupid meme shit as shown in one of the posts above.
---
Basically, inferiority complex rearing it’s ugly head. 
---
Play the Legion
---
Never de-pip
---
Almost always pip At least once
---
Get to rank 1 
---
Good, balanced game.
---
Okay, then literally every survivor perk, add-on and offering can be countered by just killing them lol
---
Just switch targets 4Head
---
wacha doin
---
Ignore how good the killer is and buy the one you like, I got a 4k with Freddy with the splinter on rank 2. Any killer can be very strong
---
:^)
---
I still have nightmares to this day about the safety tree, the magic school bus, and the auto shop.
---
No stumble when falling used to be a real drag too. 
---
Your *
---
I like how the devs are afraid of their point economy but don't give two shits about how it changes the way survivors play this game making the gaming experience miserable.
---
Imagine if you were the survivor instead of the killer. You get chased, get hooked, someone unhooks you, you see the killer immediately break off their chase to go after you again, they hook you again, you get unhooked and the killer again ignores everyone to go after you and now he kills you. Does that sound like an fair and fun match for the survivor? That's why some survivors and killers think it's a scummy tactic. 
---
If you make the bonus post trial then you double the amount of objective points you're able to get.
---
The joys of teammates sandbagging you, crouching around the maps, wasting pallets and making dog shit tactical decisions, time to play some killer. Stop with this survivor vs killer thing already I s getting boring. The game is really frustrating in general.
---
If you have a pro you can easily open the top and dust the fan and heat sink. The older version can't without voiding warranty iirc.
---
-2
---
Yeah nah I’ve just got the cheap one it was preowned so idk if that has anything to do with it
---
Is what I said wrong?
---
Freddy can definitely played effectively, but he's still one of if not the worst killer. 
---
1. Depends on distance and add-ons. Generally though, you want to stay uncloaked. Survivors won't drop pallets, and will continue to ooop you, if you are cloaked.
---
2. Some Survivors have smol-pp syndrome and refuse to leave until they can be *seen* winning. 
---
I aspire to have this build tbh.
---
/r/redditsings
---
I wouldn’t recommend legion, unless you don’t want to learn how to play DBD. 
---
I thought it was 900 something
---
Pretty sure it was always 600 per survivor 
---
Jeez. Glad I went LCD.
---
true. and you waste so much time locating the lanterns it's ridiculous. and I can't figure out the timing too. I hooked a survivor, the lantern was in my vision, it was around 5 seconds to it. I saw it light up and when I came to it it was gone. not even 10 seconds. 
---
She doesn't kill them on purpose, but when you trap someone and don't give them food and they die, you still killed them.
---
He's the guy who plays Michael when the mask is on. But without the mask, they use Tony Moran's face. 
---
Don't know why, since neither of them are blonde ish like the kid in the opening scene. I guess they think Moran looks a bit more like the kid? 
---
&gt; What about survivors being completely invincible for 7 seconds at the start of every chase?
---
If this is how you play Freddy, no wonder you think he is bad.
---
Is his nickname Indiana Jones now?
---
expected but disappointed in the end
---
I would just watch gameplay of all the killers and then decide which one you like the most. My favorite killers are Spirit and Legion, but for everyone it's different.
---
Hmm, now where could my Dwight be?
---
I actually enjoy the suspense of playing solo, but it gets really annoying when teammates make awful plays so they decide that it would be just better to kill themselves on hook instantly
---
I love that this has to be tagged as NSFW
---
But they are? Without addons that's exactly how his power works
---
I'm a shy Jeff main. I kind of prefer to play in silence or in the company of friends, not the latter for an advantage, that's just when I'm comfortable.
---
While you make some good points and they're thought out, personally, having to communicate with strangers would have me probably enjoy it a little less. Might feel a bit more balanced when compared to swf as it is though? 
---
Fire up works pretty well for that. As Freddy if I can get everyone to sleep fast enough and keep at least two asleep at all times, I don't ever need to worry about gen pressure. And sometimes I'll just run Fire Up to compensate. And if I can see survivor auras at all times, I don't need to be fast. I can just see where they are going. M&amp;A is also very good to use with him. Tiny terror radius on Freddy is good because even if the survivor is awake, by the time they realize you're close enough to put them to sleep it's already too late. If I don't have class photo I usually use the one that prevents glimpses of me during dream transition or lowers skill check chances. 
---
I've gotten good with Freddy. I usually can get up to rank 4 with him when I try. And I usually always let one survivor escape, but still double pip. I always do best with paintbrush and class photo. Paintbrush helps remove the dream transition nerf class photo gives, and like I said a tiny terror radius is perfect for Freddy. 
---
You're doing fine. You're actually doing the other survivors a favor by getting rid of that Dwight. 
---
If by worst you mean most terrifying, then yes.
---
Can you use that mask on her too?
---
Its a known bug with Nurse. She has shit called dead zones which are things you cant blink through no matter what. I haven't played after the update but I heard they brought back some of them.
---
Good ol Lobby Simulator
---
Yes, but that's not an effective use of the power.
---
"What's the password?"
---
"end game build"
---
So NOED and literally anything else?
---
Going after the person that just got unhooked
---
625 for one is right. Was always like this 
---
I just bought spirit and am definitely liking her so far
---
Legion I Understand, but Nurse and Spirit? It mostly sounds like you just aren’t good at the game and don’t understand how to counter killers. Both Nurse, and especially Spirit has counter plays both in and out of chase. You just have to practice and play against them 
---
They don't want us to unlock all 9 event cosmetics anyway. If you grind 3-5 you are good. 
---
As a p3 Tapp main this about sums up my time, nobody else does gens so I gotta
---
Alright I need your help one last time.
---
Myers or legion?
---
I appreciate the bold comments on the immersion and pretty much agree. Unfortunately voice comms probably will never get introduced. It would take them a long time to implement these and even longer time to rebalance perks like Bond.
---
ok but yes hes also the most terrifying
---
I believe it was around level 46 for 9000 shards, not 100% sure. But the amount you get increases with level. Depending on how much you play it could be a week, could be a month
---
Myers is more fun to me. Depends on your playstyle though
---
I guess this event was done to contrast the Hallowed Blight's killer-sided experience. This mess' survivor flavored instead.
---
Yum yum yum and a liverwurst ala mode?
---
I think the only people that have a problem with ochido (strictly gameplay wise) are low level reddit killer mains. 
---
Freddy works for entity becouse it promissed him buff and rework
---
And once again, you have helped me make a decision.
---
Myers and then use shards for legion (however long that takes
---
Well shit, alright, thank you this may take a while
---
Maybe if a game of he said she said is "evidence" that he asked underage girls for sexual things, because that's all there is.
---
He literally cannot hit anyone for 7 seconds after sleeping them. That is how his power works. They can get the fuck out of dodge as soon as you sleep them even if you stand right next to them.
---
Exactly 
---
Ardetha is the cringiest thing to come out of the dbd community since tru3
---
I wish we could gather everyone up that says survivors have a huge advantage and make them play the old DBD before the countless survivor nerfs (which were needed at the time). 
---
How much do you play per day? Since October (when I started playing) I've managed to purchase the spirit, the clown and the Legion through the shards, I usually play around 4 hours a day at most. Also the first match you play as a killer and survivor each day gives a bonus 300 xp.

---
I actually try to help my team even more when playing Jeff but dam
---
It normally depends, on weekends, when my friend is on, I don’t play as I’m playing with him.
---
During the week though, I just got back into it last week so about 3 hours a day.
---
Survivors are usually just as toxic if not more so than killer. We're all equally bad XD
---
I didn't like Myers, but if the guy on the right is him I might risk it all and top that lol.
---
O-O
---
Same man, I love the game and the idea of it. I'm not the best player but I love playing it. I don't understand why people have to be so salty
---
Omg the event hair. I need it so badly! I don't even have Ace, but I'm LIVING for silver fox Ace.
---
Or 99ing all gens on the map...
---
&gt; Brutal Strength, Iron Grasp and Enduring
---
I started several months past launch and Enduring was considered weak then - did they nerf and re-buff it? (because Wraith was already considered bad at that point, but all the other things were things)
---
Killers needED a buff. They have overtuned killer and now me and probably 1000s of other survivor mains quit, they should have buffed killer instead of nerfing survivor, old pickup times and pallet vaccum is what kept me and 1000s of other players stay, and spend money on the game
---
Do you have leatherface? He is worth buying for bbq alone (although it's cheaper to buy the dlc rather than with auric cells). Bbq will significantly reduce the bloodpoint grind for all your other killers, and is just generally a strong perk. 
---
blink distance &gt; number blinks, change my mind
---
He looks fun, but no I don’t have him.
---
I will definitely keep this in mind though, anything to get rid of as much grind as possible is fantastic
---
Imma play an entire game just with no mither to thancc the devs
---
You don't know how to play clearly. HINt you don't need to chase survivors who are falling asleep.
---
No offense, but it sounds like you just need to get better at being survivor. 
---
Yeah, prior to this I always go "Why are you all hot and bothered after Michael Myers, of all things?"  I saw the original and while Moran and Castle wasn't exactly bad-looking, they are not exactly....a stud.  At least not for me.   
---
 I don't remember him with big chest and six-pack abs either.  So I was wondering where all of this imagery about Michael came from.
---
Today, YouTube recommending me a kill count for the Halloween Remake and I finally saw this Michael is a lot closer to people's drawing, photoshop, etc.  Googling the actor name reveals he's the same guy who played Sabretooth in X-Men, aka former wrestler Tyler Mane.  Oh.  No wonder.
---
Topping him though?  He'll probably top you instead.  :P   Also, your flair makes me chuckle.  Did you know that in Japanese fandom Michael/Jake is popular ship?
---
hum. that is true, actually. 90% of Tapps I've seen were just focusing on gens. 10% I'd assume we're doing daily as Tapping and not actual Tapp mains.
---
Hey I guys, I found ruin!!
---
I also got the sexy pants now
---
I don’t play that much and since October I bought 3 characters. It will take some time but is better to use the shards instead of the cell to buy the non licensed characters.
---
Haven’t played in a while what does this mean?
---
Play the Doctor and remind them what pain looks like
---
Machinegunmyers?
---
This is the main reason I play survivor more than I do killer. 
---
Oh, the irony of this statement. 
---
Nah not really, i play killer and i shit on everyone i face, its too easy, killer is overtuned, survivor is hard now, used to be balanced, you used to need some skill to 4k consistently with killer
---
* **Rule 1** - Uncivil Behavior.
---
* Do not post flamebait or troll other users.
---
Removed - uncivil.
---
It allows Legion to follow the scratch marks and blood pools on the ground without ever starting the *chase* mechanic. This causes the deep wound to start counting down, forcing the survivor to try and mend themselves. The catch is, Legion is hot on their tails and they don't have time to mend and just bleed out, go down and it's an easy kill for Legion. It's a way to cheese the game as Legion. 
---
This obviously implies, that kill get a huge chase advantage, if he finds someone he will most likely get him on the floor in max. 30 seconds , not ketting kited for the time 3 gens are completed.
---
Oh, but what he said wasn’t uncivil? 🤔
---
Same fucking jokes 300 times a week HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHABAHHAHAHZHSHDHSHhhaa
---
When legion hits someone with his power they get a "deep wounds" status effect where survivors bleed out after a certain amount of time (like borrowed time). 
---
The bleed out timer normally doesn't go down during chase, but the legion player can chase the survivor while looking down at the floor/away from the survivor, "tricking" the game into thinking the survivor isn't in a chase, making the bleed out timer go down. So essentially the survivor can't mend since he's being chased and eventually bleeds out, which is complete bullshit since it has no counterplay. 
---
If a Killer is chasing someone for 30 seconds or longer and the rest of the survivors aren't getting gens during that time, you're doing something wrong.

---
I feel personally attacked by this statement. LUL
---
Don't insult or be hostile towards other users.
---
Imo, should balance killer points around survivor points. 25 per lantern would be too much, but have it variable based on how many load into the match, capped at 25. Or if you break one and kill someone completely to get full 25 points.
---
Exactly, the same was for me. I didnt play killer much for about the first 6 months i played the game because i played with my friends.
---
I play as the killer more now and it's not as fun as it used to be in my opinion. It used to be a challenge and now it's a 3-4K unless the survivors are SWF.
---
I think a lot of killer mains consider anything below a 3K a loss, which shouldn't be true.
---
Clearly he insulted me but I don’t see you addressing that 
---
"By your orders, u/quzn2.
---
I'm sorry, we'll make sure you remains are returned to the campfire.
---
To the basement, survivor, nice and easy."
---
“Only low rank killer mains have a problem with pedophiles and people ruining the experience of newer players”
---
That’s what you’re saying.
---
Did the hooked survivor get sacrificed?  The lights seem to go normal when they die...  I've had the same quite a few times, the light will be right near the hook and I don't get to smash it.  
---
I have a hard time believing you but I haven't seen you play, so I'll take you at your word. Though, that just means you're a good killer, not that survivors are at a disadvantage....because they're not. 
---
Tbh I think over a lot of matches the gain is about the same. Killer doesn't make lots of points but a few points steady each round while you have some rounds as survivor with only 0-8 points but the possibility to max it at 45points per round. Sure it feels that killer is a little at disadvantage here but I think they aren't really. 
---
Save the best for Last  + Unrelenting made killers attack recovery drop to like a second. Combine that with EW3 Myers and fun times.
---
The 7 seconds thing isn't frustrating at all. Those aren't hits you otherwise get with another killer. It makes defending totems and exit gates difficult, but his sleep mechanic often gives you the first hit for free. It works in his favor as often as it works against it
---
Everyone is free to has his/her own opinion, obviously theyre all different. i respect yours.
---
Played a few matches 3 hours ago. Queue times were around 2-3 minutes at rank 6.
---
If I could just get 1 killer that doesn't throw the entire game, and let 3 toxic douchbag leave with lamps, just to hook me and camp me, I will literally pull down my pants and shit. I spend the match keeping my distance from killers and survivors, and concentrate on totems and corner gens because of this event, fuck the killers in my area and rank, they all bring Noed and ruin. 
---
mfw people use Calm Spirit
---
Fuck man just any time there were two windows near each other.
---
No doubt
---
You might be in low ranks where killers tunnel and disrespect, survivors dc in protest.
---
Hahahhahahaba
---
Nea* bitchass always hiding
---
One thing that helped me was always be looking kind of "up" above rhe horizon, higher than you think. Big fat trees and rocks do it sometimes too but the up thing is important, keep survivor in bottom third of your screen.
---
Shitty Griffy chopper
---
He has had many complaints
---
It's not, it just became a meme when the game was new.
---
Yeah I got put into a game with rank 2 survivors and a rank 3 Billy, I was rank 14 and got absolutely mullered lmao
---
Its not about nerfing this or buffing that, its about adepting the playstyle. Correct me if im wrong, but this game was intended to be stealthy when it came out. Nowdays everyone just runs permanently with hold shift across the map and cant care less about beeing seen, because you can just take the killer for a walk until the gens are done by your team...
---
I actually got Ace's outfit first. Not crazy about how Feng's top clips with some bottoms.
---
Don't get disheartened brother.  
---
Even the most skilled Killers can have a rough time on certain maps.  
---
Keep dumping Bloodpoints into The Clown and get those perk tiers up.  
---
There are some really good video's on how to play efficiently as Killer,  *DamnNoHtml* (otherwise known as Scott Jund) posted a really good video on this subreddit a couple of weeks ago.

It certainly helped with some mistakes I was making. Also OhTofu has a series where he provides commentary over players gameplay videos, where he will give advice and guidance on the players play-style.  
---
Not all, but I would say most Survivors are gonna do that B/S. Easier said than done, but brush it off roll on to the next one an keep learning, keep getting better.

is this normal that when  i just finished vaulting the window against a doctor and  instantly after i scream  it teleports me back to the other side of the window.
---
I switched to PC a while ago because of how unbearable killer was on console. This was in November.
---
You're telling me it got worse? 
---
It says they play survivor.
---
On ps4?
---
Do you think so?
---
I mean a good billy can be pretty annoying that's right, but you can still use T-Walls and Pallets.

You also juke his chainsaw, if the billy is not that good.

A good nurse has literally zero counter-play tho

I could've placed him higher, but I wouldn't say he's S Tier

Truth. Although survivors DC at an unbelievably high rate
---
No. Go away.
---
I found success in running Totem.Doctor. Devour, Ruin, Lullaby and ToHT it’s not only funny but I can just Mori people being rude. 
---
But thank you for playing Killer. Big salute. 
---
You can still double pip with letting them go, you’ll get to rank 1 anyway
---
It's mostly because of expectation. High ranks dont matter if you're high ranked. But if you're rank 15, you expect beginner killers.
---
What region/rank are you in? Even during busy hours I can count to 10 after creating lobby and boom 4 survivors. 
---
what is wrong with you
---
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
---
As a survivor main, I usually give them hatch if they don’t wiggle unless I need my bbq stack or if I’m in serious need of BP lol
---
Hey, I don’t do the franks tunneling thing, does that at least make me on par with normal people
---
The ones from last year yeah
---
there's just something about hearing the children singing and not knowing where's he's coming from, desperately trying to get a skill check, him knowing where we are when we're outside the terror radius... these fuck me up
---
He is a low level killer main aswell if you didn't know
---
Because Tapp is all about getting shit done
---
Yes. It is very clear now. 
---
Survivor = Big PP
---
Killer= smoll pp

Rank 12 Killer and Rank 16 Survivor in EU 
---
Cattle Call: You dislike doing things without friends, especially stuff that takes effort. When repairing a generator to 75/80/85% your aura is revealed to fellow survivors for 4/5/6 seconds.
---
Escape Plan: You dislike tense situations so you always try to find the easy way out. When the Black Lock appears it's aura is revealed to you for 3/5/7 seconds. If you are carrying a Map that is able to track the Black Lock, it's location is added to the map.
---
Sigh of Relief: The relief you feel when evading the killer invigorates you. When leaving the killers terror radius, gain an 8/10/12% speed boost to repair actions for 5/10/15 seconds the next time you touch a generator. Can only be triggered every 120/90/60 seconds.
---
I dont get bloodpoints from vessel anymore but I got event points. Im not sure which you're talking about.
---
I didn't have access to it pre-buff so it didn't really matter, but Brutal was the way more popular anti-pallet perk at the time, and I think it happened more or less around the same time Unrelenting (and machine gun with it) got nerfed into the ground.
---
Your videos are always great!
---
true.. i hate the trapper and hag.. id rather play against nurse or Legion xd

Synd att man bara får höra screeching och r.i.p headphone-users. Rekommenderar att du sätter en compressor eller en limiter på din ljud-signal för att slippa jättehöga ljud från ingenstans.

Don't really hate her just needed a title :(
---
Thanks man! 
---
Pretty much, there was a gen near the killer shack that kept getting worked and I kept hearing Claudette who was injured (important thing to note: basement with two people hooked was under the shack) and she was the only one to escape and afterwards she said: “when you suck at legion: camp time.” 
---
Looking up or down changes your Blink distance.
---
I can imagine how frustrated the killer was.
---

---
If it's not already happening, hooking survivors should reward points 
---
Ok (:
---
Yeah pretty much all NA players would be on Toronto
---
As in, hiding behind the rocks, killer walks away, immediately unhook, "yeaheaa bwouaai" and cut the clip
---
Repeat as necessary
---
Played against Legion for the first time yesterday, just didn't know what to do :'( 
---
( was on a DBD hiatus )
---
Oh God Oh Fuck
---
It was actually just a regular online match with randoms. It’s one of the illusions of him that survivors see. I never really went up to it before lol
---
... No fucking way...  
---
"I couldn't help but notice your pain..."
---
I figure they’ll be a lot happier with the bps then I will with an extra kill
---
Quality shitpost
---
A way to solve the camping problem (as shit as the inspiration for this idea is). In roblox (I was dicking about with friends, honest) there's a mode that's a rip off of dead by daylight, and when the killer is too close, the timer doesn't bleed down. This would fuck up campers and make kicking people off hooks unneeded 
---
Soloq would do nothing to stop the problems with swf, people would just go back to queuing at the same time as friends and dodging until they got each other. There is literally nothing they can do to stop people from playing on voice comms 
---
I remember all of this, but I have to admit I forget about the "1" thing, can somebody refresh my memory please.
---
It'd be cool if the killer could hear the voice chat, similar to F13
---
I’m with you, we can both take downvotes
---
The entity is basically a god I doubt Freddy can do anything to it 
---
Same, old habit there, but damn that was nice.
---
that pisses even me off, what a troll... 😑
---
It’s slightly too good imo, only due to the deep wound change, if you try to punish a bad unhook it’s effectly an extra health state, and since they don’t need SC to heal out of it more, if you abandon them they waste far less time as a slug
---
Fair Play: You are driven by the obligation to repay those who help you. When a survivor performs an altruistic action towards you, gain a 4/8/12% increase to the speed at which you perform altruistic actions that benefit them. Fair Play does not stack and will only effect the survivor who most recently helped you.
---
Keen Learner: You're not an expert in anything, but you can pick up your fair share of knowledge. Performing cooperative actions with other survivors slightly/moderately/significantly increases the speed at which you perform those actions.
---
Lucky Guess: With a bit of luck, you can apply an obscure fact to the task at hand. Great skill checks grant 3/6/9% more progress.
---
You should first play the tutorial of the game and see the guide in the game, also maybe you should watch [this](https://youtu.be/5XOZNWhI6FM). It’s the best guide I could find.
---
Now your questions
---
1-You need to point the flashlight to his face. The time depends on your flashlight and its add ons. But only try to blind the killer when he is breaking a pallet, vaulting or picking a survivor, in this animations he won’t be able to avoid you flashlight so you can get the blind. Try doing it at a pallet first, it’s the easiest way. You can now you blinded the killer when the light from your flashlight shrinks and expands again. Remember, point to the face.
---
2- You will alert the killer when you do a fast vault, you make a fast vault when you vault while running. If you vault slow he won’t know.
---
3- Ruin is a hex perk, a perk attached to a totem, to get rid of it you need to destroy the totem. In the map there will be 5 totems, and if the killers has ruin you will need to find the lit totem and cleanse it. The killer may have other hex perks so even if you destroy a lit totem it may not be ruin. When ruin is activated hitting a good skill check will make the generator regress 5% i think, and the generator will spark, don’t worry the killer won’t be notified if you hit a good skill check, only if you fail. Hiting a great skillcheck will work as if you hit a good skill check without ruin.
---
4- Watch [this](https://youtu.be/wz-vK6Uzgmo) to understand better the keys and [this](https://youtu.be/eTlNrIS5mk0) for the hatch.
---
5- You only have 4% chance of unhooking yourself so it’s better to wait for a team mate to rescue you.
---
6- survivors are just skins so a perk good for one survivor is good for all the others. The are a lot of perks in the game so just read the description and try them. Soon you will know what are the ones you like the most. But self care is one of the best perks, you should try to get it from claudette.
---
Sorry for this being so long, if you want to know anything more just ask.

You legit said if I'm getting tunneled it's my fault or again a purity argument. Legions whole design is about tunneling  shoe glazing promotes this even more. If you're denying that then I don't know what to say anymore
---
biased opinion.
---
&gt; Or when Trapper could trap under hooks?
---
Trapper can trap under lanterns and you can't disarm em :D (only get the prompt to take the lantern = trapped)
---
Jesus christ you really think being bad is not hitting great skill checks. I seriously see people who have over 3k hours in the game who find it inconsistent. Nothing more irrational than a killer main trying to defend their handicaps. 
---
Same, that thing is legit a second health state for free thanks to deep wounds
---
You’re violating the rules, you know?
---
&gt; here you
---
okay I got over here what did you want to tell me
---
I mean, i said great skill checks - but you read what you want too if it makes you feel better. 
---
Pig and doctor are annoying because their abilities make a fuck ton of noise and doctor makes your screen have a seizure all game. Legion is annoying because his design is cancer and most people who play him are super scummy on purpose. Nurse is super strong and the only reason she isn’t op is her learning curve. 
---
To be honest, I've run into a fair amount of toxic survivors on PS4 (and I'm a survivor main) either as teammates or while I was doing a killer daily.. but once you get into green ranks, you're far more likely to run into a toxic killer than a toxic survivor.
---
Usually ill just run in a random direction after hooking. But if the survivor is dumb enough to be spotted first then im getting his ass too.
---
Commenter is complaining about his voice and recommended to use some audio hardware to dampen high volume sounds. As in the user wants the OP to use some studio equipment so meme videos are of higher quality as if anyone cared since they are just friends playing a videogame together and some stupid bugs happened in that game that were worthy of recording, using most likely something like GeForce Experience which allows saving of past moments of gaming.
---
Trapper should be at least A
---
&gt;1 How do you stun hunter with flashlight? I keep beam on his face, but there's no any sort of animation that shows he is blinded
---
Just point the flashlight at the Killer's face (make sure the beam is actually on his face) and it will widen if you stun him. Then near the bottom left of your screen you should see a BP notification for blinding the killer. 
---
&gt;2 Do you alert hunter when vaulting objects?
---
Only if you fast vault. If you stop sprinting right before you vault, it won't make a sound. There are perks you can also use that allow you to fast vault without notifying the killer. *Quick and Quiet* (especially against bad killers) is a great perk for that.
---
&gt;3 Sometimes hunters have that Hex ruin and it keeps failing calibrations when working on Generator, even after "Hex; Skill check" It still red...how do I get rid of that?
---
*Hex Ruin* will always give you the red skill checks unless you cleanse the totem that's causing *Hex Ruin*. You'll know the totem when you see it because it will have a fire burning under the totem. Though, most of the time it's better to just power through *Hex Ruin* unless you know where the totem is and the killer isn't guarding it.  
---
&gt;4 How do I use keys, still new like I said so I don't know items names that well, I think it was Dull key or purple one, it says it can open black locks? What does that mean? Where do I find black locks?
---
The *Black Lock* is the hatch. The hatch normally opens when there is only one survivor left and enough generators have been powered on. Sometimes you can escape through the hatch if you have a key and again, enough generators have been completed. You always need 1 less generator than there are survivors to get the hatch to show, but need a minimum of 2 gens completed before it appears.
---
Using a dull key doesn't open a Black Lock on its own. You'll need an add-on that allows you to open the hatch. A purple key allows you to open the hatch but only for 10 seconds. A pink (ultra rare - skeleton key) allows you to open the hatch for 30 seconds. 
---
&gt;5 How do I escape from hook? I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone successfully escape by unhooking themselves. Every time I do it, I fail and kills me faster? Do I need to have some kind of perk that allows me that or... pure luck?
---
You actually can rely on a perk OR pure luck. There's offerings you can use that give you or all survivors extra *luck* when attempting to escape off a hook. Still, even when using those offerings, I suggest forgoing attempting to escape yourself, as it results in failure more times than it doesn't. Without a perk that guarantees your escape, trying to rely on luck to escape should be a last ditch attempt, because you've got no other options. 
---
The perk *Deliverance* guarantees you an escape during the *attempt to escape* phase as long as you've successfully rescued someone from a hook before you've been hooked even once. That doesn't mean just getting them off a hook, but getting away safely as well. 
---
&gt;6 What are good perks for Feng Min? I really love playing her and this new Moon Rise costume makes me play her even more haha... Any good builds for her? I don't know perk names so I'll try; right now I have Quick and Quiet, Lithe, the one that lets you self recover and one that leaves no scratch marks when vaulting windows
---
Survivors are really just skins. Doesn't matter who you run as long as your running good perks. Some survivors are a little harder to see than some others, but I honestly don't feel it makes that big a difference. That said, in regards to Feng Min, run whatever perks you like. It sounds like you enjoy sprinting a lot and fast vaulting. In that case, I'd suggest, **Lithe**; **Dance with Me**; **Quick and Quiet**; and **Lightweight**. 
---
Though a safe build would be something like **Self Care** or **Decisive Strike** instead of **Lightweight** or **Dance with Me** that allows you more room for error. 
---
Hope this helps.

Eh not really. I play a lot of killer as well and I see way more killers being a dick than a survivor at least on ps4 and even more so during this event 
---
Did you read my other comment? The one that I said apart from emoting? Lol 
---
I'm a killer main.
---
When I play survivor for trials or survive with friends my main is Tapp.
---
I don't like survivor because I'm bad in chases.
---
I'm a gen jockey.

I can confirm this post is the truth.

Running guide + Thompson's mix is just a little bit slower then instasaw but cooldown is nice.
---
He witchunted other streamers like truetalent for simply beating him and his swf, he sexually harassed a female streamer and asked her for nudes while she was underage, and overall his attitude toward the game is shit. If his full swf doesn’t win it’s because “BHVR sucks” or “the killer tunneled” (even though he chased literally everyone in the match. He is an entitled baby and a bad person in general.
---
This is probably the strongest billy set, but I prefer bumper billy personally, with 2 turning addons
---
At least the killer made the same exact mistake. 
---
I personally think Freddy is the most annoying. I just hate how he slows the game down but never actually *does* anything 
---
It was the old form of "ping check" as we didn't have lobby ping meter.  If it felt like it had a delay, you just dodged the lobby.
---
Meg too T H I C C
---
Thanks, any recommendation on using the brown addons?
---
Legion has a lower kill rate than Freddy Oof 
---
You dropped the Fire Cracker just slightly too early (the timing is tricky), try dropping it just as the Killer is lifting the Survivor onto their shoulder. Or as MrRowe suggested, take a hit and then drop the crackers by their feet.
---
You don't have to be playing at a "dead" moment at ALL for that to happen. I play east coast NA and even at peak times I've had silly match ups like that.
---
I remember once getting a lvl 20 killer with like 3 hours played while my friend and I were rank 3, other friend rank 20 and a random around r10
---
Yep, it's also why I don't think "pro DBD" cannot be a thing at all in this game. Maybe if they change things to give survivor's a higher skillcap such as a dodging mechanic?
---
It's a silly joke about Killers that want to band gen tappers to avoid Ruin.
---
So much so, that BHVR specifically said at least twice that gen tapping is not an reportable offense.
---
Only seen a few Dwights doing this. Is it that common?

⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆ This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.Be careful, friends!

Uhm lol. You should have maybe educated yourself about the player level. Why do you expect something at level 100.  And when you're devotion 1 again you need less xp for the shards, don't know the math behind it but you won't lose that much 
---
Thanks I love it
---
I'm speaking to the balance of the game.  If BHVR were to run the numbers, you wouldn't see 2k be the balance... It would be 3k... Which is not balanced.  They do this too ensure killers will be happier and provide lobbies for the survivors.  They keep making the game easier and easier.
---
He wasn't much better but he was still better than the mess he is rn
---
Nothing is wrong with me. You fucks complaining about getting something for free are in the wrong. 
---
I offered him my account. Idk if hes using it.
---
I'm just surprised you expected anything from this game and the devs running it.
---
Go play in red ranks as survivor, and you'll understand why people teabag at the exit gates.  I think all BM is shitty, but you start to understand it...
---
Cleansing a totem.
---
From what fate have I saved us?
---
Whoops, it's Haunted Ground!
---
I'm not having any issues getting lobbies but I'm at rank 12. Maybe a lot of people deranked for the event?
---
I usually wait to see if anybody is in trouble but after a while playing i realised that as soon as you hear the "WHOOOOOOOOO" sound coming from the gates everything you have to do is:
---
Step 1: breath in
---
Step 2: GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE FUCK EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE I DON'T CARE IF THAT DWIGHT SAVED ME BEFORE HE CAN GO FUCK HIMSELF JUST LEAVE THE KILLER PROBABLY HAS NOED
---
 GET
---
THE
---
FU
---
F U C C.  
---
      O U T
---
step 3: WHY ARE YOU STILL THERE FOR FUCK SAKE THERE IS NO REASON TO SAVE THAT GUY HE'S ON THE HOOK AND THE KILLER IS OBVIOUSLY CAMPING HIM THE FUCK YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? GET OUT
---
step 4: profit
---
really new players probably.
---
Interesting, I didn't wait for the end game because I'm trash and die easily.
---
But reading the description, it doesn't seem like it should start chase music, and start the chase music at its most intense parts.
---
Just hit them or just jump in
---
Suprised pig is among the highest in bloodpoints
---
Just like that gen you tried to stick to, only to get insta-downed or pulled off

Frankly me too. Well said.

*PP VERY HARD GENUINE TEXAN ERECTION*

yeah true, one thing I'd change is make Self Care base game. It is practically an essential addon and 90% of the time it is brought so I'd just add that into the base game and just buff killers in return for that buff on survivors. Another thing would be change overpowered addons so they alter how you play that killer instead of just make him op, for example Huntress's one shot is overpowered as fuck. If survivors don't dc at the beginning, It's gonna feel like shit loosing against someone with that stong of addons and not by skill and if they do escape, killers gonna feel like shit because they wasted good addons. Making them more like Myer's mirror addon and Pig's Amanda's Letter addon would alter how they'd play their killer instead of just make it unfair. 
---
Often to make "competitive" dbd matches or tournaments balanced, they'd change certain rules such as no moris, items, addons stronger then uncommon etc, so I think it'd be a good idea that we try and make the game more balanced so then making their own rules in a tournament wouldn't be necessary or to the degree they do. People would often say stuff like "survivors have strong items too" though you have no clue when killers are going to bring an overpowered addon or not so often when they do you don't have a 4 SWF with instameds to counter the OP and make it balanced. 
---
Was looking to see if anyone else has posted about this and I'l in the same situation. Escaped twice with the vessel and got 0

Do generators or just hit the person
---
I get killer games instantly, but survivor matches take a bit longer yes. My best guess would be that most people normally playing killer are playing survivor for the event due to the chance to get more points towards the coins.
---
Yeah. DOH Survivors. They do that. As I said.
---
I'd like to see an abandoned militarg base similar to the one in metal gear ground zeroes
---
(Not as big as the map from metal gear) 
---
But the same goes to Nurse.
---
A good nurse is the most annoying thing ever.
---
Otherwise they're complete garbage.
---
Billy should atleast be high A if not S.
---
Let them have it or let them catch you.
---
Move on to the next game. 
---
What you mean? This cosmetic is great!
---
it counted for like 3 seconds 
---
There's terrible players at rank 1, there aren't good players at rank 20. That's what people mean when they say rank doesn't matter
---
dont forget noed being infinite and not tied to a hex
---
Smaller terror radius(so better aura reading) and you didn't really slow down when pulling someone into the dream world. So he was better but still pretty horrible. Honestly I'm not sure why the devs didn't just reverse the nerf or not nerf him in the first place.
---
It kind of defeats the purpose of Ruin.
---
But ban? lmao no
---
The votes on your comment speak for themselves.
---
Everyone playing survivors to farm gold coins :/
---
those sensors don't always work. I had a cat that died when she tried to run under the garage door at the last second.
---
Think I'll put mine back down... Put it up to play nurse as I felt like she wasn't turning fast enough at the end of a blink.  It messes me up with other killers though, keep missing hits now.

Watch a few of the popular streamers/ youtubers. Study them and the decisions they make. You will get really good really fast. Killer isnt easy. 
---
Also try to play some survivor. A good survivor can help make you a better killer, as you will think like one of them.
---
Ok ochido fanboy
---
ye, you can gen tap, but that doesnt Change the fact that you cant Hit great skill checks
---
Hit 2/3 in the video there kiddo.
---
so why felt the need to gen tap?
---
Ace=fuck you, I got my item and I am getting out
---
Not sure if that works, the killer can hear the "tsssssss" louder than the survivors and either look away or hook the survivor before it goes of
---
Top killers: Nurse, Hillbilly, Spirit, and Huntress. 
---
But killers you should get and level up first should be to unlock their teachable perks should be:
---
Hag for Ruin
---
Leather face for BBQ
---
Spirit for Spirits Fury
---
And Billy for enduring. 
---
Definitely the worst killers are usually: Freddy, Doctor, and Pig
---
And Legion is in a tier all on his own. He’s both the worst killer while also being extremely good and tunneling and downing people. He’s the most unfun killer to play against (as a survivor), and boring to play as, because he takes 0 skill. A brain dead person could use him. You’ll find many people DC against him cause it’s not worth the time or effort to go against him. 
---
Because of the poor optimization and the need to hit great skill checks is not worth the risk for notification + regress.
---
Did you know that people in the red ranks use noed and facecamp? I thought that it wouldn't be that toxic in the red ranks. 
---
Im used to be a nice killer: giving hatch, sometimes let 2 or even 3 escape.
---
Good times because mostly survivors are cocky.
---
Get used ...
---
Someone said to me when I was being nice:
---
"Dude ... on DBD if you are not yet you will became toxic"
---
As the person who made that post I can tell you that nurse had no chance. I don't think I got hit once neither any of my other team members. If you asked the nurse and the rank 20 that died I'm sure they would have differing opinions about "rank not mattering" . 
---
Shaggy would be too op, even using a mere 3% of his power, he could instantly destroy the entity.
---
Before I switched to PC, I never had a killer invite me to a group and send me salt. Happened every other game or so when I played killer.
---
You’ll get used to it 
---
Well looks like I have my work cut out for me, time to farm hag, and thank you for the info, this really does help new people
---
Okay were on the same page. I was confused. Thanks for explaining 
---
Infinites and 4 DS survivors still exist sadly 
---
Whatever it is, it's infuriating and makes me lose my sanity.
---
Yes I achieve it everyday I play a long time and get to the cap of 1 million bloodpoints and then spend it LOL
---
Obvious killer main.
---
Of course stealth and pressing M1 is piss easy, but when it comes to chases (99% of the game), survivor is much much harder. Most of the time, there are literally 10 or less pallets on the map. And with all the survivor nerfs (fast vaults etc), survivor is the harder side.
---
Did they get buffed in PTB? From what I remember what they did was put her on then changed her on release the same as Leigon (I don't remember any changes to clown at all but I'm probably wrong). I just don't understand why they can't just do this in the regular game. I mean other games do it to look for bugs but as we know, the devs barely even give a shit about bugs so I don't get the point of it.
---
Perhaps the counterplay lies less in the chase and more in hiding and not getting found in the first place?
---
I haven't seen that bug in years, but when it happened to me, I was thrown over the wall.
---
Ew trap music
---
You’re welcome. Those 4 perks are essentially the meta perks for most killers, and great starting out perks. Some killers you might want to change the perk around or depending on your play style. But all in all those 4 make a great build for almost all killers. 
---
Wasn't her nickname "(Self Care)"?
---
Does this spark joy?
---
I’ll co-sign on this.  I’ve spent 5 straight months at red ranks and most of those playing survivor are really stupid or trolling.  Neither makes for a fun game.  I think it’s gotten so bad that this season I’ve played killer almost exclusively for the first time.
---
Side note: SWF is a pile of brain dead shit for solo survivors also.  As in, when there’s one gen left and one find a key and they both leave the last one or two people behind.
---
She may have been changed on her release but that's still taking feedback from the pt anyway. Legion got a bunch of pointless changes that did nothing pretty much.
---
You’re a bit dumb aren’t you there boyo
---
Legion, doctor and Freddyare most annoying. Not good killers, just annoying to play against 
---
How did you get this data?
---
Well it was fookin one of yas!
---
# D I S G O S T A N G !
---
So? Don't act like you got robbed or something, the devotion system exists to reset the level so you can actually get shards, in fact the early levels are the fastest for shard-gain so that's a reward on it's own.
---
Nope
---
Nurse with best blink add-ons or Spirit with silent build. Yeah ok, I suck cause you're going to tell me there is counter play to that. Fuck off. I'm rank 1 on both sides. I know those killers are unbalanced. 
---
While her Deviousness evens are garbage in terms of point ticks, with smart usage her traps are one of the best effects to prolong games, and longer games equals more points on average.
---
I...I'm a survivor main.
---
Playing the chase is easier for survivor because they have smaller hitboxes, and a thirdperson view. I don't usually seem to have any problems with pallets? I can find them well, if you use them efficiently you can still have quite a few left over at the end game. Also, they literally just buffed vaults.
---
Disconnect is a kill if it would have resulted in second or third hook. If someone disconnects before or during first hook, I treated it as if not enough players loaded in the game.
---
kill yourself

grind your filthy face into the pavement

No. There's a lot of unintetional BS like maps something rolling basically no pallets, weird hitboxes etc. But if stuff worked like it was meant to only 3 killers would be OP (Nurse, Spirit and Instasaw-Billy)

This is from a match on pc, haha.

Bad but annoying, slugging Freddy was complete aids on release.

Yesterday a Decisive Claudatte lured a spirit to me while i was breaking ruin he ran in circles around me and ran off so she would change target to me
---
To be honest, I didnt expect anything less. Perfect representation of what you contribute to this sub.
---
You should make a note how often people DC against certain killer. 
---
Yeah but the thing is that all they do is one little balance change then release them. There is literally no point of having a ptr, they can just do that later on after release. They treat ptbs like a trial of the killer instead of what it actually is.
---
Doom Engravings - they allow you to do otherwise impossible curves
---
Tuning Guide/Primer Bulb to negate the weakness of Engravings
---
I don't recommend running Instasaw because consistent use of it makes you a worse player 
---
Sounds fair enough. Many people, me included, sometimes have hard time thinking tier lists as anything other than how good killers are when they should be treated as how high of a potential killers have.
---
why's that
---
Vegetable Oil and Chainsaw File.
---
Most toxic for me are p3 Bills, Claudettes and Neas are usually good sports and just say gg.
---
Rank most certainly does matter. It reflects skill (Usually). I want nothing to do with red ranks, looks way too stressful. 
---
LEVEL is what doesn't matter.
---
I may not be as friendly as I thought. Since most low (high?) rank survivors don't know anything but running like hell I've had to take a more aggressive approach to farming.
---
Usually I just down them and take them to gens and lamps until they start to listen.
---
Oh damn
---
Also I recommend running Spirit Fury every time, Ruin is pretty dogshit and Billy doesn't need it.
---
Jævla fitte
---
I mean rank is bullshit because it's easy as hell to rank up, but at the same time people who are *actual* beginners shouldn't be matched against people who know how to play the game.
---
I think the bloodpoints needs to be divided by average game-time, Doc and Legion games tend to be a lot longer than Nurse or Billy so effective BP-gain should be what counts instead of per-match.
---
You said just nurse or spirit and yeah, there is easily counterplay to that. Silent spirit only gives the ability to sneak grab usually only able to work once before survivors are smart and avoid it completely. 
---
Rank also means nothing coming from the guy who refuses to verse certain killers. You still suck mate
---
Feng looks so peaceful when she's dead
---
Oof. I'm normally kinda bitter at Legion memes but Total Drama Island memes are naicu
---
You have nea crouching around the map.
---
Think she’s gonna save you before second state? Think again 
---
I could have done that, but at some point I felt like I spent more time writing down the stats than playing the game :)
---
To be completly honest, I didn't experience many DCs against Legion. Out of the 140 games against Legion, I only faced 4 Legions who abused their ability by moonwalking or looking at the ground. I feel like this sub makes too big a deal out of it. But I confess when it happened, I felt like turning off the computer and swallowing sharp objects.
---
Killer should give it every time.  At that point they already won with a 3k and pip.  It's okay to let both killer and that one single survivor you didn't kill to both walk out with pips and points.  Hatch standoffs are absolutely disgusting and make zero sense. The killer can literally win 3 more games in the 30 minutes you mentioned.  Before I get accused of being an entitled survivor I'm a rank 1 killer every month and I wouldn't be caught pulling that sweaty time wasting bm bullshit at a hatch.  No need to be that selfish in this game.
---
Get mindgamed kid B)
---
Same for PC.
---
Just trying to help :( but I swear I couldn’t hear the hissing sound immediately after hitting a survivor and ended up getting blinded
---
because when people just start playing they wont have any dlc, so they go to buy some later on and just learn slowly which dlcs came first.
---
the magic school bus or friendship and tolerance still haunts my soul
---
I don't get your comment
---
Yikies
---
A good thing to do is chase a survivor and force them to break a pallet or 2 and then break off of them to patrol gens and find another survivor, especially early game. Then the new survivor will try to go to a pallet spot that's already been broken 
---
&gt;Clown seems to be below average killer eventhough he seems to be featured high on most tier lists.
---
Me: Clown is a buggy piece of garbage and his base power essentially doesn't work without addons.
---
Other people: Clown's high tier.
---
This post: Clown has a bad kill rate even though he's said to be high tier.
---
Me: [**HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM**](/intensifies)
---
Clown main salt. I'm not going to go too in depth into Clown's issues but I am going to mention that his 15% 2 second slow slows him down by 15% for 2 seconds when he uses it.
---
Hell yall can have it as long as I get a lawnmower offering. Cut the damn grass on all maps so I dont lose people on spirits map.
---
I just played a double party streamers game and the killer downed me a minute in and camped me the whole game
---
So here's an idea; run at the hatch, bait the hit, and then jump in.
---
If they won't hit you, then just run and do a gen, then come back. Repeat.
---
I don't see how this many people get stuck in games that are a half hour to a hour long just because both sides decide to stand on top of the hatch....
---
I guess it’s intended to make you think “I was so brutal to that survivor that he quit the game”
---
If we're talking chapters, it was halloween, but if it's just DLC in all, wasn't it Bloodstained Sack?
---
In some games rank matters. But in DBD as soon as you understand what you have to do to pip it's very easy to rank up. Once I started out getting rank 1 was an achievement (literally) now you realize that it doesn't matter at all.
---
Agreed
---
Jeez, you have my condolences 
---
imagine disconnecting cause your a bad player just play hillbilly and 4k on the reg
---
The head is ugly, but the dress is good
---
Well, if you have 3000 bp and want to buy a 4000 perk or Something else, if you keep pressing on that perk, your bp will show 0. 
---
“Why don’t you take a hook over there?”
---
Unless you are getting shelter woods and the game every map, there should be plenty of pallets and windows to run around. I mean, I can do it pretty fine.
---
Medium vaults are faster, and you retain your momentum after vaulting.
---
Im not saying you didn't help and im sorry if i sounded rude but the killer can hear things louder than survivors
---
Now I want a killer named “The Middleclass” who’s just a guy with a beer belly who beats people with a rake, and his mori just slam dunking a Claudette’s head with a lawnmower.
---
You'll get used to it and you will improve with time. Watch some vids on youtube about running tiles or killer in general.
---
A good place to start is on Scott Jund's channel (DamnNoHtml)

---
No one really has that reaction tbh. 
---
If you see these posts about the matchmaking, all there is to it is an OP who still cares about rank and thinks it matters a lot.
---
You get rank 1 by playing the game regularly. There's nothing more to it. 
---
Lol baby survivors gen tapping.  My rule is if you're too scrub to work through it go find it.  I don't allow gen tappers in my survivor games.  I see you pull that baby dick shit on my gen I start teabagging endlessly until you stop.  If you refuse to stop I quick vault the nearest window endlessly until you repair like a man or leave.  Don't worry killers I got you fam.
---
Dude they said firecracker PASS
---
Legion stats probably skewed by newbies playing him and not knowing how he works.
---
It’s cool but there were a few times where I’m pretty sure the sound didn’t even play at all and I got blinded out of nowhere
---
It's not enough points not enough offerings per bloodweb
---
well hello there, Darth Plagiarism the unwise
---
I can never remember what PASS means.
---
I've gotten the full 45 pts in over half of my survivor games, have yet to break 25 as killer so....
---
Devotion levels, my dude.
---
Well shit, you’re right....tapps are always gen jockeys, thanks tapps!
---
The legion point right there. "Most people who play him are super scummy on purpose." You just gotta realize, its not the devs making the game as bad as some people think it is, its the people who play it. Those peiple are gonna exploit everything they can to make the opposing side have the worst possible time. BHVR had good intentions when making the Legion. I personally love the idea they had. A killer who can be mistaken for a survivor and can do what they can do in chases. Thats a really good concept. Its just that he is a bit more op than that. 
---
Especially considering that is like the 50th time that one is reposted.
---
I meant chapters in general but yea most people probably wouldn't guess 80's suitcase 
---
speaking of suitcases and sacks I miss them
---
Hmm. I certainly have met people who DC as soon as they hear the screech of a Nurse. I think you should either treat DCs as kills or then not count the games with DC players at all. A DC has the effect of making the game more difficult for all survivors, most likely causing some error in statistics.
---
Its the same exact 4 memes on rotation.
---
Jesus Murphy its been like a week tops
---
Honestly, the ranks need to take 3-5x longer to progress, I mained hag, and it look like 5-7 steamrolls to go from Rank 17 to Rank 14
---
Been saying that for a while...
---
I meant the doc can only see the doctor illusion araus in tier 3 or with add ons. 
---
Math isn't on your side bb
---
I don't do hatch standoffs as killer or survivor.  I will slug for the 4k sometimes but if hatch is open and they get there they can have it.  If I'm the survivor and I find hatch I just jump.  If the grab they grab.  Not worth my time.  
---
but you'll never find them because they already DCed.

How many time will this get reposted? 
---
Honestly I wish they did more with the deafened debuff. It's a neat debuff conceptually.
---
I think Clown could easily have an addon that deafens people. Along with Cigar Box (makes the visual distortion more disorienting) you could really get some cheeky hits in on Survivors who can't tell where you're coming from.
---
That was an initial bug where if anyone exited with a lantern before you died you’d get the 25 pts. That’s been fixed.
---
Ace hair is nice. Makes you look like Mafia boss. The pants and shirt are nice but I think they're a bit too bright.
---
Huntress set honestly looks kinda bad to me. At least the weapon and the hat does. The suit itself is nice though. Probably going to stop grinding this event once I get 7 coins. I don't play Huntress anyways.
---
The first set is the easiest to get. I got it after about 20 matches or so.
---
Well based on his perks he is objective foucsed. 
---
I was playing Wraith one game and I went up against a David who'd constantly try to do that vault. He'd keep getting stuck on it and after awhile whenever he went to it I'd just nod at him and hit the wall of the bus before leaving.
---
I laughed about it in post game chat and he said it was because I was lagging, but he was the only person who was bugging out there and everyone else was fine. (Except for the Ace who said "he was lagging" when he Dead Harded straight into a wall like 3 times)
---
Long ass queue times for Survivors since the event started, and don't tell me cause killers are less. cause I'm waiting about 20minutes to join a 350+ ping lobby.
---
I know you've probably heard this before, but have you tried to play killer?
---
Dead - On - Hook. 
---
As a survivor I can tell you that that’s intentional, at least when I cleanse totems. I see someone get injured, I’m on that mystery totem like the plague
---
I really don't know how you can say rank doesn't matter at all. From my own personal experience, being at rank 20-17 is very different from rank 11-9
---
Quality is terrible sorry
---
What's potato about this?
---
This! I’m rank 1 and my boyfriend is rank 13. Because of his busy schedule and my way too free days I play on his account as well to get his dailies, and – geez. The chance of escaping a rank 1-5 match is so much higher, due to your teammates actually knowing what they’re doing and having smart tactics. Not saying that everyone is a clueless dummy on lower ranks but... let’s just say that the chance of running to a Dwight main who’s hiding in a locker throughout the entire match is quite a bit higher 😅 
---
That wasn’t a straw man. 
---
Instasaving is a form of sandbagging, it’s pretty common knowledge. 
---
Are you really going to pull the troll card again? It seems that’s all you ever do when you seemingly don’t have any counter arguments. 
---
I play killer every rank reset to get to rank 1 for diversity. I find it boring.I either 4k or 0k depending if its a good swf or not.Otherwise no I dont play killer that often.
---
I was doing a gen and turned the cam around and got scared the shit out of. It was a Claudette behind the gen.
---
Pig is the most fun killer
---
sadly they wont happen. only a charity case 2 can happen.
---
What I mean is that rank is suppose to display skill which it doesn't really do in this game considering how easy gets to rank up once you know how to do it
---
I completely agree with everything you're saying! Survivor on ps4 during this event is pure torture!
---
technically they could
---
"Tunnel surviors carrying vessels then break them" ....... Okay, and what happens when you hook someone carrying a vessel? That vessel is broken, correct? Face camping does NOTHING, but RUIN the event/game for someone else. Tunneling someone after they are unhooked also makes NO sense,  seeing how they no longer have a vessel.. lol. Just my opinion tho. When I play as killer, i instantly go search for lamps to break or another survivor. 
---
So 44 seconds right. Now take 10% off of that and you get 4.4 seconds. Two people are getting 4.4 seconds off of the gen timer meaning it takes 35.2 seconds. 
---
This is assuming no one has toolboxes or other perks to speed the gen up. 
---
Interesting how Hag seems basically top-tier in both categories (although behind Doc), but is least played.
---
Also interesting how Wraith isn't even that great in BP generation, I always thought the bell was great for that thing even if he's meh at killing.
---
Yikes. Ive played 50 hours (between killer and survivor) total and im rank 8 and still steadily ranking up. You may have to change your approach to the game if youre losing that much
---
Add me psn My username on here minus one p. Add me I'll be on in half hour. I already got the plat but I will help you. Also got a shit tonne of keys.

"Not as bad as the Hallowed Blight" my ass.

---
But progress is being denied. That's not acceptable.
---
Jump in the hatch while the attack is cooling down?
---
You can't fix potato
---
Take a break and play something else if the fun factor in DBD isn't there for now. Burn outs happen in all games. 
---
I think AnklePick may have finally gotten banned?! 
---
yep
---
Doctor shouldn't have a problem with this
---
Its a map addon
---
I personally like to pretend when I don't see people in order to bait them into stepping out into what they think is my blind spot. Works pretty much every time. 
---
I do the same, but when I first saw them we basically locked eyes
---
Those are clearly doves. 
---
Yes, I read it. I also have a brain and so understand that it's completely impossible to do at this point and the only possible result of adding built in comms is making the game much easier. I then gave them the benefit of the doubt by assuming they were also smart enough to know this.
---
Not even an ochido fan lol, but I dont mindlessly hate him because he flashlighted and t bagged some people in a video game.
---
I mean, when I suck as killer(rank 19) and I get marched with people rank 15 and below, there really is nothing I can do.
---
Can the killer see the beacon?
---
PS4? A few days ago I loaded a game against a rank 20 Nurse. 3/4 survivors were rank 5 and one was rank 3. 
---
I messaged he person and sure enough they had just gotten the game and this was like their 5th game ever. 
---
I felt so horrible. 
---
It's for the map to mark things everyone can see it
---
a man can dream.
---
No 
---
He WAS the most obnoxious, biased killer-main you’ve ever seen!
---
Attempt 2: Denied.
---
Advice for next time to help you sell it include the word because then try to include some reason or something to justify your bullshit "point".  We can fix this troll.  We have the technology.
---
No

Hey, all Davids that join the Medkings and see themselves working for the team, instead of for themselves are my friends
---
Because there aren't multiple times zone across the world 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Pretty sure you gotta buy her too
---
It's a drawing/painting haha 
---
Nothing potato here. 
---
Yes you gotta buy her. She ain’t cheap since she’s the 3rd best killer
---
Try civilization 
---
Progression slows down.
---
You have blink just the right amount at just the right angle I managed it once after an hour of trying in a kyf game 
---
I get saved by BEAUTIFUL P3 Taps on hook all the time. And lots of times they have had insta heals. They are rare, but they are wonderful people. The world needs more P3 Tapps. 
---
OKAY HAG, I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME DESPERATE NEED TO SHOW HOW BIG YOUR DICK IS, BUT SLUGGING IN A 2V1 WHEN 1 GEN IS DONE IS A BIT MUCH.
---
What I do with spirit is after i hook someone I run far far away, once i feel like a survivor will come out from hiding i use phase walk and go straight to the hook. The only problem is when the survivor isn’t actually rescuing the person on the hook it’s pretty awkward appearing in front of them 
---
You do if you pull your internet/get connected due to internet issues. 
---
Is this a meme thread? Huntress is free. 
---
Problem is, they could make changes to factor in time played, but it would probably give any player running Slippery Meat infinite instaheals. 
---
I don’t mind the wait O would rather have it done right then fast. They also have to run everything by the licenser 
---
My game randomly freezes for a few seconds in games and it’s annoying as hell. No idea how to fix.
---
Is there any tips on how to know if it's haunted grounds cause I've done this twice so far
---
I think the general consensus of the subreddit is that rank isn’t a representation of skill level but a representation of time played. People who are rank 1 have played much more than people who are rank 17, and it’s unfair to put those people together in a match.
---
I am assuming he didnt know how to reply after that and tried to void it by deleting everything. That's why when someone is doing stuff like this I always include their name in my comment so they cant hide when they say terrible things like their last comment.
---
That is the fabric of space and time itself shattering.  It happens one out of every million games when you get a P3 Claudette that's actually useful.
---
Bro, player level has only been out for 8 months. That’s not nearly enough time to learn how it works /s
---
Rank 20's are more like unranked players who don't even have access to ranked yet. At least Bronze players have *some* understanding of the game.
---
Wretched shop, ironworks, Torment Creek right off the top of my head. The Game has a certain RNG which gives one. There's plenty of other ones too 
---
You can’t leave the hatch then, they’ll instadown if you’re away
---
No, literally every map has a very low amount of pallets- some of which are unsafe. And that's barely a buff, .1 second is nothing and you will still get hit through the window.
---
He was just trying to deliver the pizza you ordered 
---
With the point system right now it's not really free, 4500 points altogether and I get 20-45 (possibly less) each game? I might as well just buy the cosmetics with auric cells because I am most definitely not playing over 100 games when the waiting times are this bad as well as how unfun the matches are. 
---
You are safer on the inside.
---
LOLLL
---
I only give the hatch to people if their team gets roflstomped. Other than that, no mercy, especially for tea-baggers; I usually bring a Mori just for that occasion 
---
Its exclusive
---
Lol I've gotten that achievement 8 times for different groupings of my friends.  
---
Ah, I forgot that you speak for absolutely everyone, especially people who need the hits to complete the dailys they don't want to do.
---
Literally op, I can't think of any situation where you even get hit with that perk.
---
Just wait till they find out that Wraith, Doc, and Hag are all black
---
most killers do this. they literally look at gen placements and choose where 3 are close to each other. I do that with Hag on long maps, for example. or tbh with any killer on long maps unless I play Rin cause I don't use any other fast killer. 
---
my argument was that the situation you took as an example is not a common thing and needs no solution but report whenever it happens which is going to be reviewed by mods individually. and I said it's a weak example because this stuff takes a lot of time and concentration from killer's side to pull off and apart from that, everyone still actively getting the points. in the situation with survivors immersing no one actively gets anything. even immersed survivor doesn't get much doing so. therefore this issue must be addressed and resolved asap. 
---
Just know this, when the devs released kill rates some months ago they had to exclude matches where noed was involved to keep the numbers closer to 50%. 
---
That's a big oof
---
thats not what an infinite is.
---
Red Envelope enables bloodpoint gains from the event. Event objectives reward bloodpoints outside of the normal cap.
---
Didn’t you used to have a popular YouTube channel for  CS:GO or is it a different ImCows? If it is, why not keep that channel alive?
---
found the Claudette main
---
damn its good to be canadian.
---
No no no, that’s the casual jacket tapp. You probably see those the most. The police vest Tapp, you’ll never see them until you’re already downed, flashlight saving, body blocking, pallet dropping, and  borrowed time...they come as quickly as they go, and even though they wear a bright blue color...you’ll never see them until you’re injured. They don’t even run empathy. They just know.
---
thats not nice
---
does it really. it doesn't say that in the description
---
Not every teammate is useless by choice. If you're bad at the game and can't run the killer around, you'll rely much more heavily on stealth. Them hiding and not doing gens is simply their way of saying 'I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing and I'm afraid to step out of my comfort zone' - Nobody wants to die in this game, and the weaker you are, the more you have to rely on slow approaches
---
Question about kill rates: what about DC? Were they included into kill stats? Were the matches with DCs were dropped?
---
"Vad hände?" "hAH OKEJ!" :D
---
Quality content btw!
---
I was hoping I could actually walk trough, but unfortumately, the wall hitbox is still there
---
Whenever people bring up their rank, this is really the only point you need to make. I've been to rank 1 numerous times, and all it takes is really just playing enough, because some games, even rank 1 survivors are the dumbest people you can meet, run in straight lines and are easy downs, or maybe they're playing with a red rank friend and they just started.
---
It would have to be able to be disabled. Also as far as immersion goes maybe proxy chat? Overall doesn’t seem like something the devs would do
---
The map
---
DS - basically the same because it doesn’t make you more effective, it just gives you one health state and most people who run it can’t loop for shit. 
---
NOED - wayyyyyyyyyyyyy more kills, literally halves the work a killer needs to do and makes them faster. People almost always just dip as soon as noed pops so no one gets saved. 
---
What I love to do is place a trap right in front of lockers I suspect people are in. Unfortunately, they usually jump out. Luckyly, my trap is often sat before they can move away from it
---
I wait forever for a lobby with SWF. It’s like the more people you have already, the harder it is to match. Does backing out and starting a new lobby help?
---
Where can I find these kill rates? Not to disprove anything just would love to see the large scale data on this game.
---
What in tarnation?
---
This very well could have been me, unless this is common. Are you a rank 1/2 killer? It was literal mid swing and someone popped it, so salty
---
This is just bad manners dude, it’s not funny for anyone but the dwight. It should incur a penalty cause it takes away from the gameplay experience of other players
---
I've played solo at rank 7 and gone against a rank 16 killer(Or 14, or somewhere around there). He was a michael myers that, early on, walked RIGHT by me. Figured he had seen someone, or maybe I somehow magically evaded his line of sight(Even though we ended up pretty much side by side).
---
Turns out that was only the beginning of him getting ran around in an extremely painful manner. He got a few downs, but popping his EW3 early, and messing up continuously made me wonder if I was doing really well or something. Nope, come post match lobby, he was fairly unperked as well.
---
I feel bad for these killers, because I have 700 hours into the game(More on killer side, but still), and they probably have like 30. 
---
Lol
---
Is it really that annoying to play against the spirit? She's kinda one of the more fun killers to play against.
---
It’s a timer on when the devs are gonna fix they’re game
---
WHERE IS MY BOI BUBBA? 
---
I'm rank 5 but I most play against 1s and 2s. I'm also on console, though. So, if you're on PC, then it's not me. 
---
I actually have a lot of fun facing a Nurse, especially over Legion or Freddy.
---
You forgot the spies from the shadows being pretty much mandatory unless someone like whispers a little more
---
Theyre meant to just be skins essentially
---
Sand bagging piece of shit 
---
I've gotten plenty of gens on account of another survivor running d-strike though. Either the killer dribbles, which wastes like 15 seconds, or he eats the d-strike which buys minimum 10 seconds, and a gen I might not have gotten, was guaranteed secured. Same on killer side. Lost ruin and 3 gens because he bought himself half a minute extra of chase, which meant I still had 0 pressure
---
But that's my personal experience, which was why I wanted others take on it
---
As for NOED, I agree. Too many people go down to noed
---
Don't think there's a statistics chart available. The devs tend to release numbers on dev streams, I believe
---
Because its a brazil comiccon item
---
Praise be to open internet.
---
He's a default Killer with a power that actively wastes his time. At least Leatherface and Wraith can use their power to a semi-effective state, be it to instadown and break pallets or to move around the map faster and sneak up on Survivors. As Trapper if you didn't place a trap in the handful of locations that the Survivors *actually* decide to go to ~~and don't get fucked over by the traps' crappy hitboxes~~ you literally just wasted your time by placing traps.
---
:)*
---
You are getting bonus blood points when you bring an offering, but yes all the skins look like crap and the objective to get them is pretty terrible in my opinion.
---
Rank DOES NOT reflect skill.  The only thing it reflects is time played which in turn factors into experience. 
---
No. It's just a 10 year old dead meme. 
---
It’s fat shaming everyone
---
I’ll try to find it. They were the ones released before the most recent ones. 
---
I seriously don't know why Trapper can still damage himself with his traps in 2019. In my thread I sumarize the issue:
---
&gt;Trapper is currently the only Killer who's power...
---
&gt;* Has to be picked up.
---
&gt;* Can "damage" the Killer.
---
&gt;* Can be removed from the game (to an extent.)
---
&gt;In addition he has the only power other than Pig that can be seen before the Survivors see you (yes Survivors can hear Hillbilly/Leatherface chainsaw but it's entirely in the Killer's power not to use their ability in order to maintain an element of surprise) and is the only Killer other than Huntress with an ammo limit on their power (but unlike Huntress, Evan has to go pick up his power while Anna can just interact with a locker.)
---
OINK
---
"literally" unplayable
---
get a dictionary
---
Yes, I agree with you then. I'm not trying to say that hostage doc needs a fix asap. I was just wondering if it was bannable. (Since before you showed your support ticket I thought it wasn't bannable at all). Also considering it's really obvious when the Killer is doing it so you can just DC at the start of it instead of waiting until the end (like when the last Survivor starts hiding).
---
And again, as I said before, there's a difference between 3 gening and hostage doc. Hostage doc doesn't chase, doesn't down (unless it's really easy, but he won't hook), and doesn't kill. He just protects the gen with the purpose of wasting as much possible time as he can.
---
ya can you guys imagine if like....some guy was just crazy about a video game character and wanted to actually fuck them...who in their right mind would do that? haha.....
---
When you've already cleansed Ruin vs Spirit but convinced yourself she's also running Devour Hope.
---
He's probably fun to play(To a certain degree). Being able to relentlessly chase and maintain a chase is more fun than playing hide and seek. Design-wise, that's a good idea. The execution's just pisspoor, because the one thing he excells at is the one thing everyone hates - Tunneling. 
---
He sucks at downing, so he has to stick to a single target. He does that exceedingly well. So essentially, the only way to properly play him is like that. It just sucks the fun out for everyone else
---
Error 300 (aka the Save error) keeps happening and I lose my offerings and the bloodpoints. I don’t know how to get rid of it. 
---
Lol yeah I don’t know either, I just assumed because it seemed odd for someone to delete their own account. But who knows! He also left something nasty to me above but auto mod got to it. That’s what had me thinking ban too 
---
If my play-style is to track and avoid the killer which would be the best way to go about my perks? I currently have:
---
Empathy - to see where he’s hit someone and how far he is from me. 
---
Dark Sense - to see where he is after I complete a generator. 
---
Alert - to see where he is if he breaks a generator or pallet. 
---
Self Care - to heal up if I get too close and get hit. 
---
Are there any tips I can change or do to make the best of this “find and avoid” play-style? 
---
Nope not me then, pretty shit luck if this is common, but great use of the perk
---
You should play survivor with friends or play kyf with them. I personally don't like to play as a survivor too, but it's much more fun friends regardless of losing or winning.  But your friends should be at at least rank 15, because low rank killers are pretty unfun to play against.
---
Not Feng’s :)
---
That's really dumb. "Just never get found! It's that easy!"
---
The first coin is a hundred points, the second takes 200, third takes 300, etc, etc
---
Is there a reason they would let you finish cleansing? That sounds ominously creepy.
---
Here's a question! Why are you guys such nazis? This is obviously related to DbD, and just because it doesn't have a little picture of Billy on the side means nothing. Jesus christ.
---
You can't play poorly all the time and get to red ranks.
---
I love how bubba is shaded at each tier lmfaoo
---
No doc?
---
When you're playing against trapper but the Pig's the real killer
---
Every instadown is avoidable, hopefully there is a gen with a pallet close enough that u can kite till back to hatch. Also, hopefully Myers isnt almost t3 ;)
---
Been playing him a lot as of late, running ruin, sloppy butcher, T1 enduring and T1 shadowborn, and I actually have a lot of good games with him, using no add-ons or offerings.
---
The one thing I suck major asscheeks at is finding survivors that go into hiding as soon as they hear the terror radius, and wraith completely counteracts that. I find them nearly instantly every game because they don't ditch, and if they're behind a wall, you're guaranteed a free hit most of the time because they panic and get indecisive on which direction to run
---
There's some pretty bad games of course, but overall, despite using no add-ons, barbeque or NOED, I've done fairly well on him
---
Worse than a brown toolbox
---
hatch should not spawn after the 5th gen is popped. That’s my only major issue with hatch. That’s the worst of the stand offs when a survivor already has The means to escape with out using hatch. 
---
It's interesting how he has the biggest channel (515k vs noob3 ~360k vs monto 260k)but his own gameplay is so annoying. I think people only watch his funny moments videos cause those are actually pretty funny. 
---
There’s almost no difference between rank 10 and 1. There’s a COLOSSAL difference between rank 15 and 1
---
“Optimization PASS”
---
I don't think it's just Hag. I usually play survivor but was playing Spirit last night and 2 out of 3 games as soon as I had someone ready for the hook, they'd DC. People are just sore losers and can't deal with being out played so they leave instead of finishing the match.
---
Just shows a lack of maturity, imo.
---
You dont understand, i have it , but there is no skins on the game
---
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA no
---
Bad joke because the best Killer is actually free
---
That was definitely Jendenise the most toxic killer, and not Morf at all. 
---
Elvis nea
---
Half the survivors I run into on PS4 are toxic cunts but I have yet to meet a toxic killer 
---
Tire but all rank does in this game is separate the bad from the decent. As long as you’re good enough to get to rank 10 you’re good enough to get to rank 1 as it’s very easy to pip
---
Yesss, watching and taking part in firecracker blind fails is honestly one of my favorite things in the game right now.
---
I remember once trying to blind a camping killer before unhooking a fellow survivor and wound up blinding myself. XD 
---
Everyone would run david or Dwights. Swf teams would run 1 david and 3 dwights
---
It's not like they've been working on his rework all this time. There's obviously other content they wanted to make as well. 
---
A competent huntress is extremely scary. She has the potential for the fastest down of any killer, even including nurse, simply because huntress can hatchet into an M1 nearly instantly, at which point the nurse is still wheezing from her first hit.
---
With that said, billy is a lot EASIER to be a top tier killer with, but that doesn't mean that a good huntress cannot best a billy in a race for a 4K
---
We Nea mains are maybe the only ones never seen by the Killer in the entire match.
---
Even if someone gets hooked, we don’t care; our duty is to escape.
---
Yes, we are little sneaky bastards.
---
Can barely see that he is a prestige 3 hillbilly.. god 2.4 ruined alot of stuff..
---
His funny moments videos are also getting boring after a while; it's getting repetitive. But HybridPanda is a bigger dbd streamer, although he isn't always playing dbd.
---
It's maddening is all i can say frankly.
---
Name one event where you could unlock more than 3 full outfits by playing the game.
---
David will always have dead hard
---
Neas are toxic and will likely run you around
---
Bill is either extremely good or extremely bad. There's never an in between
---
Claudettes are always hiding in dark corners
---
While your healing you press space and it will instantly heal you. You should try to save the pink syringes for healing someone downed though because it fully heals while the purple styptic heals one health state(so injured to healed or downed to injured.) And also when you use the rainbow map you can automatically make beacons. 
---
Damn. I really miss this state of the game. It was unbalanced and shitty but man did we have fun for hundreds of hours. I wish I was as into the game now as I was before. 
---
Clown

https://amp.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/89qgtj/r1r5_killer_stats_without_dcs_moris_and_noed/ 
---
Keep in mind that these statistics are also nearing 10 months old and the last two sets of stats that we were given suggested that kill rates were progressively increasing for each killer. 
---
Doesn’t matter got 1000 points. EZ 
---
You would be surprised how many still fall for it. Especially when it's a Claudette. 
---
Just because it hasn't happened in the past doesn't mean that this should be the standard. Do you think we don't deserve more than 3 skins for an event? And do you not think that both of the survivor ones are lazy, and that the huntress skin isn't meh? 
---
Yeah, it really is irritating. When I'm survivor I usually just admire the killer's moves when they get me. I'd rather play from that perspective and enjoy my game than rage about someone being better than me in that match. Does it suck being the first on the hook at the beginning of the game? Sure, it does. But there'll be other games and it's not fair to the other players to just leave like that. People take the game far too seriously. I find it kind of light hearted, even if I end up screaming at jump scares all the time.
---
Or when Killer vaults and pallet breaking took ages?
---
Or when you could stack Sprint Burst + Balanced Landing?
---
Probably just swf
---
Congrats you were the bigger simpleton
---
My time has come
---
Oh I just checked. That's hilarious. I wonder if he changed his name and will just show up again under a different name. Idk how the whole banning system works.
---
I guess this is less applicable to console players because the framerate is ass but, most of the time I see gen tapping as just... why? Just do the skill checks. 
---
Sadly its only a scrap and it is not in the game 
---
Them how do you get 4 tokens end game?
---
I never really thought to try it 
---
If the killer gets to it before you and camps it.. then just go do a gen. Hatch is perfectly fine the way it is. If you stand there doing nothing until you get a crow on your head then you’re a nutcase 
---
Here is when I definitely don't give the hatch: 4 man game and everyone goes down before 2 generators got done. I'm not willing to wait for them to finish another generator or two. If it's a 3 or 2 man game, I probably will have the patience, so again, it only applies to 4 man team
---
Oh this is true. I know how everyone loves altruism in this game, you can bet I'm focusing gens when there's a 90% chance the rest of my team will be focused on the chase-hook-unhook-chase game.
---
Those 3 d-strikes
---
r/SoftwareGore
---
It's better if you don't know
---
Lol legion
---
Don't worry man.  The micropenis gen tappers downvoted me for saying the same thing.  Lol trash cans can't hit skill checks.
---
When this happens to me I just wonder round the map and ignore them. They get bored pretty quick if you ignore them. I then report them after the game.
---
Ruin is unfun because you suck at hitting skillchecks and you don't want the game to be slowed down because it lowers your chance of escaping because you essentially NEED to rush out the gate, otherwise you die - You're so bad that the ruin's usual minute long lifespan ends up killing you, and you'd rather sit and mind numbingly buttfuck a generator that takes literally 0 skill to do
---
Flashlight clicking is done with the intention of being an asshole - Whether it 'triggers' someone or not, that's not the point. The intent is to taunt the killer, A.K.A being toxic
---
I've never blamed a lose as a killer on any of those things. I understand getting butthurt about SWF, but none of those things have ever prevented me from having fun or made me rage. 
---
We dont like your kind around these parts
---
I don’t know about an immediate ban. But under multiple occurrences (like most other games) it should definitely be a ban. I know I’d be salty if that happened to me and would definitely report for griefing.
---
You hit 2/3 but still choose to baby tap?  Sad bro got gud toddler
---
Tapp mains? Do they exist?
---
This is like 10 times easier than Hallowed Blight imo
---
he's all over the reddit, it's better if I do.
---
Quick enter in the following numbers or you are doomed: 4 8 15 16 23 42
---
Megs are bold and stupid. The kind of survivor who will brazenly run in front of the killer and get chased, only to almost immediately get stuck on a hay bale. 
---
But... he's a fast boi
---
It's why your bl didn't activeated omg lol 
---
Ohhh there's even more on the Twitter (whiched is linked on that site). I like a lot of the Pig/Nurse art.
---
Here's a cute Amanda/Huntress one:

---
Hence, bias. You have no argument, period. You clearly play primarily survivor, because otherwise, you'd at least concende that d-strike is a completely unfun perk to deal with, same as noed. They aren't well-designed and don't fit the theme of survivor versus killer, because both take away the competetive element and turn it into a 'Get fucked' situation
---
Really, you have no ground to stand on when you're trying to tell me that ruin and barbeque are shit for the game, but d-strike is fine
---
[Mine?](https://i.imgur.com/oQGgKMl.jpg)
---
Once more you are arguing that ruin doesn't punish good skill checks. Do you even play this game?
---
Flashlight clicking doesn't prevent you from doing anything. This comparison you are making is absolutely moronic. Come back when you've actually played the game. 
---
It's not like this is a free game like League, where you only have to pay for the skins. I think it's more than fair to ask for more earned skins. 
---
As long as the team wasnt toxic, I’ll carry the final survivor to hatch.
---
I’ve tried several times, at least. I’ll pick them up, shake my head “no”, and even carry them to a hook, look at it, and walk away. Drop em when they wiggle, look at them and shake “no”, then pick them up. In the several times I’ve tried to give hatch, they NEVER stop wiggling. I’ve downed and picked someone up 4 times in a row before. I’m happy to give a decent person hatch, but I’m not going to let them wiggle out and believe they outplayed me.
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday when I tried to vault that window
---
I feel like Monto deserces way more subs
---
how did this get more than 50 upvotes
---
Because the dev's are morons and never think anything through
---
I think the event is decent but definitely a grind fest that incentives you to just buy the costumes.
---
Honestly, if you want BP just play as doctor and lag switch with the right perks you'll get around 50-60k BP a game in 10 mins or so. 
---
The way they implemented earning coins in this event is definitely trash though especially with their recent patch. I'm at 6/9 coins at the moment, by running a macro and just afking in survivor games averaging about 8-12 points per 10 mins but this event is still a grind fest. 
---
Deserve? For what exactly? Why do you think we "deserve" a lot of free skins?
---
Must be some crazy lag 
---
I've never once blamed a lose on a game on ds nor did it prevent me from having a good time. 
---
SWF fucks the game for both killers and solo survivor. Personally I always take pity on the solo surivor if he's paired with a 3 man. Devs really need to just add voice coms and balance around it.
---
This every solo game lmao. 
---
Not sure. My friend was still cleaning the lit totem, also he saw me down there, he would have been teleported too. I don't know.
---
I've never really had that bad a time with ruin, because I have no problem dealing with it and most of the time it's gone. I've never had a bad time with barbeque because there's so many counters to it
---
I've had plenty of bad times with d-strike. Guess it's just your word against mine, huh? 
---
He used to be one of the worst. His power can instantly end chases and although he is very luck-based, that can be limited with good trap placement. I'd place him at lower mid-tier due to set-up time.
---
Also it can be Devour Hope occasionally 
---
Doesn’t make me smile because I don’t get my BBQ stacks
---
Who actually uses a rainbow map though?
---
What the unholy prick?
---
Projection is all you are working with. 
---
This fix is gold meme.
---
This looks great. How many games it took you to get those? Did you use just devour hope?
---
People applaud it because people want actual consequences for toxic behaviour. It was a dick move and Dwight will get no penalty  for it. If it was an instant week long soft ban, literally nobody would do this anymore in fear of getting cut off. Yes, something as simple as an instant week long ban for a hardcore bodyblock would completely kill this off
---
It is a very good idea. I mean, if you don't do this, why would you be bothered by it? 99.9% of players never do it, so why's it bad if that 1 in a thousand person who's intentionally an asshole gets kicked out of the club for a week?
---
I’m just telling you the excuse he used
---
I don’t have any issues with it so I’m good ❤️
---
Oh yeah true those sounds are getting annoying but better than the nasty sounds those plants from the Halloween event made *shudders*
---
That’s because you’re the chosen one! 
---
Spirit should be S, Legion should be S++ and nurse should honestly be A. I rarely face her, and the few times I do, she usually gets crushed or snowballs and the game's over instantly. The other two, the game either lasts a painfully long time, or everyone disconnects
---
Consequences for toxic behavior. Like what survivors do to killers? I mean they could apply the same punishment for the shit survivors do using exactly same argument as you are using. Doesn't sound so good idea anymore?
---
I'm skipping this event completely.   It's not fun,  it's not engaging, it's distracting to the game.   By far the worst event yet.
---
Oh he’s the funniest DBD you tuber cuz he’s actually good at the game and makes funny content
---
Oh yeah true but still better than the nasty sounds those plants made in the Halloween event *shudders*
---
Hybridpanda has more subs than ochid0. He's a bigger dbd channel and definitely encourages non toxic gameplay. 
---
I just hit them till they leave. They can’t lay there bleeding out forever unless they want to die or get hooked. 
---
Probably about 20 games. And every kill, except for the first one, are through devour hope
---

---
Legion was by far the worst DLC killer they've released. I don't like how he/she looks (his design looks boring/uninspired af, "hey look, it's a junkie with a knife... how scary and intimidating that is) and I don't like to play as him or against him.
---
The Spirit is leagues ahead, she looks cool and her power at least allows for some mind-game potential.
---
At this point I just wish they would give us a new licensed killer but knowing how much they want that extra money from the cosmetics it seems unlikely at this point.
---
This game seriously needs new content besides pointless cosmetics... it's about time they consider a new mode. I'd be down for anything. 
---
Teabagging, flashlight clicking or whatever toxic thing you can think of won't force a down or the killer to lose a chase or something. It doesn't actually affect the outcome of the gameplay. This actively fucks over a player. This completely alters an outcome and manipulates the player's choice, in which he/she is entirely at the mercy of their teammate's decision. 
---
Comparing teabagging to bodyblocking is like comparing shooting a guy to showing him the middle finger
---
Freddy's basically a god himself in the movies. 
---
Damn. That's not that many considering it takes just one totem to counter.
---
hahaha why? :)
---
Probably just poor connection to the killer. Thats what it sounds like to me
---
As an Adam main I’m here to set it straight that Adam comes in two forms: Chase god who uses DS and Deliverance to fully annoy the killer for 3+ gens or Stealth Ambulance who will come running at you with a 5 token Autodidact and make the killer think they brought an instant heal. 
---
If the survivors were just playing the game, and I have all four barbeque stacks, I have no issues with simply letting the last person get the hatch
---
The struggles of being a licensed character
---
You not had any firecrackers today?  Would've been nice for you!  I hate those things XD
---
Well if you check out perks I used you'll see that there are 4 hex perks. One of them is Thrill of the Hunt. So as long as not everyone goes for the totems at once, I can get some kills
---
Happ Tapp reporting in
---
Don’t guess just assume every killer has noed and BBQ you’ll live longer. 
---
We are playing now 
---
We all hoped legion would be something else, I still believe that they originally had some other idea (like disguising or something) but it wasn't working so they put this ability in last-second to get the killer out the door in time for christmas. And a disguising killer would be awful, but at least it would just suck and not be anti-fun, idk, they were just on such a good roll with spirit and then we get this abomination. Not to go on for too long but I haven't really played since legion and i want to, but legion kinda drained my passion for the game.
---
I'm thinking yours is possibly because of lag. But at least twice I have been mid chase and vaulted and nothing had happened. I'll make sure to clip it next time.
---
It's why it's a lot harder than usual to find survivor matches cause there's no incentive to play killer for event points.
---
F is for Freddy.
---
Also they need to update the game so the huntress is back and get rid of the hitboxtress.
---
Duh ya silly goose 😂 
---
Omg, I meant to type Meg. My brain malfunctioned. I haven't slept enough, aaaaah. :-|

"Dedicated servers won't fix anything"

Posted by Reddit_NPC#3287432
---
Lol that’s fair just confused me when I saw it 
---
I like to do the unhook animation a bit just to fix myself on the hook.
---
More like, d/ced because I'm tired of people using the SWF loophole to play at a level they don't belong at. Red ranks don't belong in my lobbies but they exploit the shitty matchmaking system to get an EZ baby killer.
---
Also, no thanks. I don't like the hillbilly. I don't like playing him, and as a survivor, I hate playing against him. He's just really boring to me. Maybe some people like him and all the more power to them, but I'm not a fan of one-down mechanics.
---
I've very rarely encountered, on either sides, that the players tell the killer to kill themselves. No life? Sure. Uninstall? Sure. Toxic shithead and other inconsequencial verbal nonsense? Sure. Camper? Sure. Tunneler? Sure. I've heard most everything, but pretty much never kill yourself, as ironic as that sounds considering the game's all about killing.
---
A week long ban is reasonable because the person doing it is fully aware of the action they are performing, and there is no second guessing it. There's no reason to do this. A week long ban would take that small amount of one in a thousand to none in a thousand. If there was no consequence for murder, stealing or kidnapping, how many people do you think would do it versus actually doing it? I'd say a whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooole lot more
---
Punishment is key to controlling negative behaviour, and because nothing will happen to dwight, this will continue to happen
---
I will eat and come on
---
Ruin - I'd like to see the statistics where it lasts for the entire game, and it's not the survivors being ass at hitting skillchecks and the killer doing an exceedingly good job at defending it, or survivors simply choosing to ignore it because they can actually hit skillchecks - You know, things that warp the statistics. 
---
DS - 30 seconds can become a minute under the right conditions, just like ruin can live on under the right conditions. Hell, it can become more if the loop's safe enough, such as god windows, which they were denied, but got because of d-strike. Also, 30 seconds is nearly half a generator's worth of repair. Over three persons, d-strike gave you 20% of the game's entire progress(Because a generator is 80 seconds. That's 90 seconds from a single chase) - Ruin on the other hand, can give as little as 2-3 skillchecks through the entirety of its progression. Yes, it happens. Or it can be done by someone not as boosted as you, and it pops in like 100 seconds, versus 80. That's 20 seconds before it likely goes boom. Good job, that's 90 seconds versus 20 it just acquired. Hot damn is that a lot, amirite! It's less than a 4th as effective under the right circumstances
---
Oh, nice! I only have like... the Wraith's, the Hag's, and Legion's teachables right now. :( One day I'll find people easier.
---
So you still wouldn't want to incur a ban on player asking for another to kill themselves but you would be ready to ban anyone who bodyblocks another survivor, on purpose or not. 
---
You either apply the same punishment for the same crime for everyone, or you don't do it at all. You seem to be incapable of agreeing with me. I wonder why.
---
I heard that last night every session I played as killer. I was wondering what was going on. PS4
---
Yes. The potential. She has to catch up to the survivor for that. She is slow and has a larger terror radius thanks to humming.
---
So in the time it takes to waddle up to a survivor at rank 1, billy and leather have already caught up and one click downed them, and michael if with nearly topped up evil within can right click left click win.
---
She is not scary - you can dodge the hatchets, sprint burst from her, she has one aura read add on that unlike other killers requires her to play the game to see *one* survivor, her ability fails during chest high wall looping (every map, especially her own) which her slowness exacerbates whereas every other slow killer besides Freddy has an answer (trap/teleport) and her ability does not work in indoor maps due to small open spaces (lery's, the game).
---
She also falters in a lost game scenario. Billy and leather can always one hit someone, michael can sometimes, she can't do anything to survivors trading places between you and the one you just hit as she can't throw over a body shield.
---
As soon as they make her iridescent add on the default, then she's on billy's level.
---
This was very helpful.
---
Been tryin to decide what new ones to get.
---
Know that thinking of getting Leatherface and Michael. Looking into Freddy (had him for Ps4 and found him hard to use. Any helpful tips for Freddy?) And Legion seems interesting to use. Tho, been hearing all the negative of it.
---
I changed my steam name to Squadette to illustrate that I fight for my friends.

Facts
---
YES!!! Ive never really used premonition but I knew I'd heard that sound somewhere. I've been having it on xbox since the winter event 
---
What was he like before the nerf?
---
And then when we got sex we still had to reque 50 times
---
Just hit them until they leave. Start using NOED until you get better at dealing end game.
---
its quite sad how you feel about skins bro lolol.
---
LMFAO THIS EDITING
---
Isnt this the sound of the obsession getting chosen? Never used premonition so I dont know what it sounds like
---
yeah everytime i face a nurse she transends time and space itself to find my ass
---
I got one of these in one of my first survivor games because some rank 2 SWF got camped by a huntress...Picked it up and hatched(Hoe camped that too but got impatient and stepped away for a sec). Good way to earn that Vulture achievement.
---
Ace looks like he's enjoying it and that worries me.
---
Yeah, for some reason it had a huge sledgehammer in it. 
---
Verbal toxicity far less severe? Like asking someone to kill themselves or actually threatening someones life is far less severe?
---
Ok now I know you're just reaching and disagreeing with me simply just to argue with me. I know I'm right. You probably do too but you just don't want to admit it.
---
Rank doesn’t matter it’s ok. 
---
ohhh lol
---
Actually playing with 4 hex perks is really hectic. Only after the first 2 kills you get to enjoy it. Also, more than 50% of the time I didn't get to use devour hope
---
You need 4500 points to gain all coins
---
As a killer, the best you can do is destroy 7 vessels and hook all 4 survivors 3 times. In one match, you'd get at max 24 points for the hooking and 21 points for destroying all vessels, totaling ar a 45 points in a match.
---
As a survivor, the best you can do is finish all 5 generators and escape with a vessel. 20 points if you complete all gens and 25 if you escape with a vessel. This also totals out at 45 points in a match.
---
You'd need to play at least 100 matches to get all points. However, for the killer to get these max points, he needs to have a perfect match with 7 of the event offerings while a survivor just needs to complete 5 generators and doesn't even need any offerings to get max points.
---
I tried using more realistic numbers to point out that getting points as survivor is easier as killer, but I came out at an average of 19 points for killers and 20 points for survivors. So I think the problem is more so that it takes a long time overall to get all coins and it's way harder for killer to get max points than it is for survivor to do so
---
Thanks, maybe Nea or Quinten would wear it. 
---
I'm saying that I'd rather take someone saying 'Go kill yourself' than to be t-boned by an idiot heading into the round-abount at 80 kmh. Yes, the severity of the action decides the sentence. 
---
The fact that you're saying 'I'm right' is precisely why you lose any merit, because anyone that felt like they were actually right about their statement, wouldn't need to verify it by stating it, just like someone saying 'I'm really funny' probably isn't
---
Also, you're clinging to the kill yourself argument like it's the only form of verbal toxicity to exist. That's narrow minded and you're sticking to it to suit your narrative.
---
If you were to choose only ONE person to get banned, would you rather take the person that told someone to uninstall, or the person that bodyblocked and got another person killed? No round abouts. Answer this. Stick to this question. If you cannot, and need to find a way around this question, it means you know you cannot justfully say 'They're both equally bad', and whichever option that ISN'T 'The person bodyblocking' is just you trying to push a false and very narrow minded narrative
---
Casual jacket tapp is almost as camouflaged as Claudette. Only on gens bc stealth. I run unbreakable and tenacity to sneak away from killer. The dark knight. Vest tapp is exact opposite 
---
Wow they really didn't want to put any effort in those DLC cosmetics after the in-game store came out....
---
I'm such a locker slut. 
---
True but I think most people would agree nurse takes more mechanical skill and game sense. Idk maybe it's just me but after putting time in on both the insta down hatchet is just easier to hit and with 3 of them it's pretty easy to get at least one. If all else fails just run up to them and point blank hatchet haha.
---
Lol imaging wanting 7000 points so bad
---
I run kindered. What I really hate is when 2 people still come for the save even tough I run it. I used to use a lot of bond untill I became an ace main, I already have plunderer's and ace in the hole, then an exhaustion perk and that only leaves one perk slot. (Also my bond is only level 2)
---
Oh ok, my bad man. Thanks for the awesome vids!
---
It has a soft skirt at the bottom probably to seal it better, but I can’t really tell what kind of door it is, although he probably wouldn’t have broken his neck if he had kept his chin up and done it at the exact wrong moment he might’ve really hurt himself.
---
Edited my comment for clarity
---
Same here. I swear between this, updates every time you want to play, and Xbox Live issues, gaming in the modern age is a fucking shitshow. 
---
Submit a support ticket on the DBD website.
---
Nani the fuck?
---
I think he might be right. I imagine the English only rule is due to not having moderators that can moderate non-English content. From that perspective, i can't imagine non-English comments being easier to moderate than non-English submissions.
---
I could be wrong though.
---
When a killer sees multiple people join a lobby at once, they may assume its a SWF and decide to just leave the lobby. 
---
Other times if the lobby is not full, it could be that the killer has just grown impatient of waiting for players as they may have had the lobby open for awhile before you joined. 
---
I'm seeing it occur commonly for the former and I believe its got something to do with this event. I have never seen so many killer lobby DC more than the past few days of this event.
---
I have this problem too ☹️
---
You actually fucking ignored my point yet again in favour or your own narrative. This is precisely why you don't have any merit - 'Which is worse, uninstall or causing someone to die?'
---
You: YoU tHiNk BoDyBlOcKiNg Is WoRsE tHaN TeLlInG sOmEoNe To KiLl ThEmSeLvEs
---
Yeah I’m a hag main so it’s difficult to juggle totems with a 4 Man SWF at Rank 3
---
Sometimes Johnny Bravo went overboard but I love shows that write up like that.
---
Parkour billy best billy 
---
You should be a comedian, you’re jokes are hilarious 
---
Explain how noob3 is toxic or GTFO.
---
I tend to leave lobbies when someone has a bad ping because it's not fun when the survivors teleport around the place.
---
This is very good!
---
Yeah that sounds like a bad bug
---
Is it an event? NOED
---
Is the killer really bad? NOED
---
Are you rank 15+ and the killer isn’t nurse or billy? NOED
---
I played a whole day and didn’t realise until the end of the day I was still at 3/300 for my next coin

Check out @DeadByBHVR’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1091682714217054210?s=09
---
Are you sure it isnt the Obsession sound?
---
It's also by how much you can play the emblem system, play with friends or have luck in competent random team mates.
---
I hate hex haunted grounds. 
---
It just is the most useless perk, only once rivalled by old surveillance.
---
It makes 2 fake hexes yes, but the other one snuffs out if it gets destroyed? Makes no sense but whatever
---
It lasts a flabbergasting one minute
---
Make your choice is reusable, guaranteed on one person, and if you have fast movement ability you can have the saviour take a hook even if healthy.
---
But when it's cleansed, every survivor immediately hides for that minute, making it nigh impossible to actually find them to smack them.
---
It might be useful exclusively early game, where everyone is fully healed and doesn't even have to not bother to heal up to make exposed useful, but then that's it.
---
Exposing the survivors is useless if they're injured.
---
This has been my rant on the worst perk in the game.
---
squish squash squirt
---
First game back in a long time and this cocky ass dude was running me around as doctor. Finally got him and he misses his ds so I plop him on a hook. Insta DC from him and his buddy. Not a single gen done
---
0K and more points than two of the survivors, pretty good job so far btw 
---
ah that explains it, i also run rancor so that explains both noises. ty
---
Every trapper i’ve played against has Agitation and Iron Grasp
---
No ruin?
---
Ok guys I got Dev hope 
---
🤗
---
yea it probably is, ty
---
Unless they also run DH and TOTH
---
yea i get that too, thought it was intentional tbh
---
Yep, same issue. 
---
Mechanical skill is meaningless when you have infinite tries. Instadown hatchets are low blow but at least there's some kind limit to it. And of course there are certain maps or parts of maps where avoiding instadown hatchet is simply impossible. Haddonfield being one of them with its long straight corridors.
---
yea xbox will prolly fix it soon
---
I get really horrible frames sometimes especially on certain maps, Mount Ormond is basically unplayable. I had to change to low settings to get playable frames. Before the winter update I used to run the game on the highest graphic settings without ever dropping frames.
---
Same I've restarted the application 5 times, and restarted my system and I still get a initialization error once it get to loading the license cache.
---
Stake out is always good, Detectives hunch is almost always good, great if you're hunting totems otherwise not super useful, tenacity is situational against sluggers and if they go to break a pallet before picking you up because sometimes you can actually get away with it. Stake out is definitely my favorite Tapp perk.
---
In my experience Tapps are always doing the most. They’re worse than Claudettes with their toxic behaviour but they always do clutch saves and tank hits for their team. 
---
Yeah that's exactly where mine would mess up as well.  I uninstalled and am currently re-installing.  Will update results.
---
Eh both are toxic on every platform but survivor toxicity is just annoying, killer toxicity can actually ruin the game sand waste everyone’s time 
---
I answered your question, you imbecile. I stated that I would much rather ban the person in the chat because they are far more frequently encountered in games. I can do nothing but conclude that you are actually fairly stupid.
---
 Why does that skin looks like a combo between the nightmare and the pig :I
---
Just do what I do. Don't go to exit gates if you're  sure you can't get anyone and afk and find something productive to do until they leave 
---
I will secure the 25 points for the both of us if you Kobe and make it out....
---
Yep, just tried to sign in for the first time. Same error here.
---
Before the nerf he had a 16m terror radius
---
He did not get slowed down after sleeping a survivor. 
---
When a survivor was healed from the dying state they were still required to be woken up.
---
I actually like the lantern thing although some people clearly don’t get it: https://clips.twitch.tv/CuriousArtisticKumquatLitFam (I have so many of these but this one is just the worst, when I actually earn them by escaping from someone who is definitely killing us it’s great but somehow I can’t give them away, but because I know it’ll take me soooo long to get more coins it’s not worth it to play more than my 2 daily games) I just don’t think the grind was reasonable. 30 hours a week is nearly a full-time job where I live. 
---
They were useful when they didn’t have an audio queue to let you know they were going off, now they’re next to worthless.
---
ya this is amazing!
---
As you said. Survivor dont have that many Ultrarare addons/items. So they can lose it through Franklins and Consumption. Try to get some nice Killer addons ins a lvl 50 bloodweb consistently. Sometimes I wont get an Ultrarare for 3 Bloodwebs. Why shouldnt I be able to use my lat addons quite a few times with a black ward? Or why should it only work on non ultra rares? Doesnt make any sense to me.
---
Who hurt the matchmaking system😭😭😭
---
Did them telling you shitty things that you can ignore by leaving the lobby before they say anything screw up your game in any way shape or form? Something completely ignorable and meaningless? And also, let's take into account that these are words said by complete strangers with no personal relationship to you
---
Also, like 90% of the time, as long as I play fair(No camping or hardcore tunneling), they just say gg. If I play like a shithead, they'll talk to me like a shithead. It's kind of one evil unto another deal. But then you have the remaining 10%. It's usually just dumb shit like 'ez' and 'go back to training mode' - It's rarely ever as bad as 'Go kill yourself', or anything even remotely close to it
---
Do I think people telling others to kill themselves should be banned? Yeah, because some people are at the tipping point already. Do I think people saying 'uninstall' should be banned, even though it's entirely avoidable and purely relates to the game? Not really
---
Do I think someone actively completely fucking over a player which 100% influences the flow of the game for three other players should be banned? Absolutely
---
EDIT: game is now working again 
---
PREACH!!! They have become such sweaty tryhards
---
Yeah, and start at lvl1 on everything again
---
You got my two of my Radical Nea friends near the end! That’s not very Rock-and-Roll, ma’ann!
---
Why if it takes 2 mins for a killer to find another group lol
---
Have fun 
---
Hope you enjoy the rest of the event
---
Sounds to me like you just suck at taking advantage of it. I've turned Haunted Ground being popped into a 4k. Try doing that with MYC.
---
Getting instadowns consistently as him is easy when you give him 5 or 6 matches of practice. At least nurse requires hours or even days of mastering 
---
I get a host error on ps4 at times
---
I sometimes run maps, sometimes I miss a totem but with a map you will find hidden totems a little easier. 
---
How dare you disrespect Franku?
---
Max level is 4 tokens so you're safe for 4 skill checks and if you get any greats on your own then that means you'll be able to do pretty well on a generator.
---
They prob maxed out in bp and had to go spent em
---
This should be pinned at the top of the sub
---
I'm a rank 1 Freddy main ;-; don't insult me like that 
---
Except how many games and tries did it take before it was even useful? 
---
Case In point. 
---
It *can* be useful.
---
Just... The damn galaxy needs to align for it to be more than a wasted perk slot.
---
As I explained *quite clearly*, it's because you don't actually have to worry about *losing* your add on, whereas survivors still can lose theirs.
---
"I will take a hit and run to exit" would fit better I think. Still ok tho.
---
That is happening to me too on PS4 
---
It wouldn't be so bad if 4 mans weren't so toxic. I only started playing killer a few weeks ago but dear god the swf groups are the worst. I don't mind them too much in game, but post game is unpleasant no matter what.
---
My legion is like lvl 19 or somthing and i i pretty much suck with legion. Not touching him anymore just getting his perks. 
---
But thanks for the advice. Appreciate it
---
Getting to the basement consistently? With a slow killer? Then getting back in time to catch them out? Before they heal?
---
Leatherface chainsaw doesn't need to hit more than one survivor - that's still one more than the huntress can down in a gate open scenario and it's another chance to down/grab the second survivor if they try to unhook again.
---
She does not have the fastest down speed. If your qualifier is from a survivor standing still in front of you and depressing M2, Michael beats her with EW3, if you take a normal game then catching up to a survivor to M1 after the M2 is a joke considering sprint burst or vaulting.
---
Long range != useful. I already said indoors, small open spaces, chest high walls, loops, all of these ruin usage and are on every map, you cannot win with range. You also seem to not be a huntress player because loops cannot be thrown over since ducking and hitboxes of scenery are fun. You can also not be hit by a hatchet by spazzing out and making your direction impossible to predict, simply doing that throws off a huntress let alone bothering to dodge the hatchet once you see where it's going.
---
Denying windows requires time to deny. Usually you turn into a corridor too late to wind up the hatchet which is again, exacerbated by her slow speed, and if you can't do it in time you either have to slow down to put it away or waste a hatchet.
---
Height differences only exist on hills and even her own map has trees and rocks covering those to prevent you seeing survivors, let alone hitting them. Some maps lack hills, half the time you'll never touch one in a match they exist in just due to hooking proximity and survivor routing.
---
Don't make me laff about preventing unhooks. There's always five objects of scenery in the way and a chest high wall. There's also swivel hooks, aka, be my shield person whose health state cannot change except to sacrificed or unhooked. And that's if another full health survivor doesn't run in to body shield. Bear traps and mud tiddy triangles put off to the side where unexpected will always yield results sooner or later because there is no counter play for the unexpected unseen.
---
I don't care about streamers. If they're good at the game they can take any killer to the top and half of it will be cheesing perk load outs.
---
Who
---
Big yikes dude
---
Very nice of you, feel bad for that nurse
---
We're gonna live forever+ borrowed time, yeah buddy gimme them points.
---
This is pretty much why I play them from time to time. I know how much it pisses them off. It's hilarious to me that the most survivor-like killer is also toxic to play against.
---
You literally haven't given me one reason to think otherwise, and your acting like a complete moot. Imagine insulting people and telling them to jump in a lava pit because they said something you don't like. Must have really struck a nerve with my last comment if you still have nothing of substance to say.
---
Do you happen to use DS or another obsession perk? There's a sound similar to premonition if you're the obsession. 
---
Cuz a rainbow I got it. ;) The killer clearly doesn’t want anyone to steal their “The My Little Pony Manuscripts: Fluttershy Helps Wonderheart Learn The True Meaning of Friendship” fanfics. 
---
“IT’S NOT FINISHED YET!”
---
Yes. Trading map pressue and easy downs for base speed (just like spirit, which is a 110% and sometimes can cut loops even better than spirit) is a fair trade 
---
Or it's a fake out. I've run Devour and stopped to stare at cleansers. They'll often jump off and run, thinking it must be HG, lol.
---
Not related to this post but I miss when it gave 200% bonus. It kinda caused farming problems but getting points as survivor kinda sucks.
---
To be fair, it took quite a long-ass time to fill the vials the last event(Actively playing for multiple hours a day for a week). The skins are designed to be bought, not farmed exclusively, which is why the grind is made atrocious to compensate. The free version is made for those without jobs, pretty much. For anyone else, it's just a slog, where they want you to buy them instead
---
Again, what I meant was that it takes fairly little extra effort to obtain the coins over just regularly playing the game. Normally, you try to escape. Now you find a lantern and then try to escape. It adds about 5-10 seconds to the time spent in a trial, as opposed to the last one which added minutes and made complete newbie killers get to red ranks because no survivor ever attempted to escape
---
So, a video game about serial killers attracted a disturbed person? Hmmmm.
---
i could care less about the event tbh, i just switch to killer so people have a game
---
In that case burn any bonus point offering and spam his abil don't pick any one up. Milk that legion 
---
That's how I feel about MYC, honestly. I'll get at least 1 down, often 2, from HG. I almost never get an MYC down because they'll hide as soon as they save and the only person I can find is the fresh unhook.
---
Requires two perks to be combined, and still doesn't prevent your buddy from just being tunneled again.
---
Uh... Clearly you violated the terms of DBD’s mandatory smoke and/or peepee break, you vulture!
---
I you offer me 4× Points, I would probably even let the last guy go, ob purpose 
---
True but the amount of mechanical skill that's required to blink to exact parts of haddonfield is nuts. Idk imo it still plays a factor. Especially since you need to know how long it takes for every piece of junk on the map not to mention you need to know how each person is going to juke you. With huntress you can just hold a hatchet and zone them to easy spots or just run it like a normal killer then get guaranteed ranged hits. Just my opinion you can think what you like.
---
Adrenaline wouldn't wake you up, only heal one state and give speed. though I'd prefer no heal but wake up cause it makes more sense. 
---
The devs should stick to event hooks / generators. Because they are shit at secondary objectives.
---
Okay, first of all, you're trying to point out her flaws, and diminish her strengths by presenting absolute worst case scenarios
---
She's weak in in doors maps? So is billy, but he's top tier. Guess that means he's shit. He can't deal with loops any more effectively than any other 115% killer
---
Myers has a prerequisite for his fast down. Huntress has none. If a billy misses his chainsaw at point blank, he's useless for the next 5 seconds. Huntress misses her, and she'll still easily get an M1 if they're near a window
---
More often than not, there's a lot of open spaces where a survivors only choice is to run towards a window, and that's something only the huntress can deny. No other killer can, period. Not nurse, not spirit, not legion, not billy, nobody. Wraith can deny it with certain add-ons, but we're talking as a base killer, because if we're talking add-ons, she has the dumbest ones(An easy to confirm exhaust which screws over most exhaustion perks if they aren't used, and dead hard is 100% screwed, and the obvious iridescent head, which is probably, alongside red thuft of hair, the most broken add-on in the game)
---
Vaulting guarantees her hatchet. No other killer would have hit that anyways, so now she's the only killer capable of hitting what literally no other killer could. Point to huntress again
---
Preventing hooks - She's the best at it. If she isn't near the hook, then neither is any other killer. We're comparing them in an equal circumstance. If they are in front of the hook, she is too. If she doesn't have line of sight with the hook, they don't either. We're not arguing 'Billy is better at defending the hook point blank than huntress if she's across the map'
---
'I don't care about good players doing better with her than other killers, making it painfully apparent that I have no points to make in regards to suggesting huntress isn't top 3 just because I play her like shit'. Yeah, I know. If a streamer can get all four players slugged on the ground 2 minutes in, or play the game for 10 minutes with michael myers, that's an obvious strength gap in the killers
---
If you're on PC you can use MLGA. It will give you everyone's ping in the lobby 
---
It’s more: a video game about serial killers MADE him a disturbed person. Fame made him cocky
---
The instant I heard that you'd be able to buy the cosmetics from this event AFTER it was over made the insane total points required to get all 9 coins make sense.
---
BHVR just want you to spend hard cash on these cosmetics, the same as all the others.
---
This event is just to bait you into wanting them.
---
So basically it’s impossible for all 4 survivors to get full stacks? I’m against this idea as it makes the map a war ground and makes survivors rush to find totems if they run the perk. It would often be more detrimental to the team than helpful. 
---
This was very creative, amazingly put together OP!
---
Bunny skin for frank from the legion pls
---
I predict he'll be able to hit people normally but his Dream power will have a cd and just make them exposed.
---
Shit. The wait times are that bad, eh?
---
You could always play killer yourself. There's a suggestion.
---
You ever met a police jacket tapp? 
---
i was talking about shitty decade-old memes 
---
Watch it wiggle as he pushes it up ath the start. That thing definitely doesn't weight more than a kilogram. 
---
you know it's bad when one of the upsides is that the game is at least playable
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.
---
I can't when I want to play with my friend, when he isn't on I play killer plenty of times and don't leave no matter who is on the survivor side. 
---
The odds of all four survivors getting 4 stacks each with WGLF is rather low in non-farming games though, ain't it?  Not to mention the fact that it's a team effort does kind of mean that the rewards should be split between each member.
---
but hey, they could make it where you just get 100% BP for doing a totem, or 75%, or something, just as a way to get survivors off of generators and getting them to do Totems.
---
Yeah, really. That's only in part 6, which is a major retcon for a good chunk of the series.
---
I don’t have many perks on my clown I just leveled him to 50 to unlock his perks and because I always at least get the new characters to 50.  
---
Anyway I usually run coulrophobia, distressing, thanatophobia, and nurses calling.  I use the add ons to increase bottle number by 1/2 and spread the area of affect and to make the survivor hit with the gas have the mangled effect.  That’s really the only synergy I have on him at the moment.  It works okay as long as you always have at least 1-2 people hurt.  
---
What I’ve seen though is that the clown is good at getting people to either drop pallets early or make people leave loops early so Spirit fury, Enduring, brutal strength, bamboozle.  Stuff like that is playing to his strengths.  Those perks are pretty good for almost any killer though.  
---
Yeah, sorry that sucks, man.
---
I do like to see perks get reworks because it might push killers into trying out new stuff. Sloppy butcher used to never be used, now it's really common. Of course, having a killer that isn't ResidentSleeper would be nice too
---
If you don't already use headphones, you should use headphones everything is so much louder and easier to hear. 
---
He hesitated. He thought it was what he wanted to do but when it came time to do it (much like when he confronted Ben) he couldn't bring himself to do it. Which is why Yoda brought it upon himself to call down the lightning strike.
---
It's usually not so awful. But it's been really bad the past couple days. The SWF squads are A LOT more coordinated than usual
---
I'd say you could earn enough shards by the time the next chapter comes out. Try and get that daily bonus each day, even if you don't like playing one side
---
Could I have the template please? 
---
ok man however you wish
---
nah i wrote that i didnt
---
Honestly I just want WGLF to have pretty much any other secondary purpose. The obvious thing to do is make it the survivor equivalent of BBQ so that the unhooked survivor (and possibly the unhooker?) see the killers aura for 4 seconds. 
---
I like your idea of making it include totems, a kind of token style system where saving a survivor/taking a hit counts as one token, every second totem cleansed counts as a token, stuff like that. Would make it a much more team based perk. 
---
The hillbilly perk cancel the droping of the surbivors and u je just get blind
---
Lol. I was doctor last night and one of my survivors double vaulted because he screamed in the middle. 
---
For some reason, facing a Myers tilts me the most. His tiny terror radius is something I really don't mesh with well. 
---
This most certainly was connection/server related. There is obvious desyncing between host and clients. Problem can be either directly related to connection/routing or the way game is being processed on hosts computer ends up showing the survivor still stuck on the balcony.
---
That's true that a bug which causes desyncs between host and clients would not be fixed by dedicated server but it would also mean that all other clients are desyncing as well. Depending how the game functions it would revert to a state where synchronization is restored. So it would at least change it so that all are experiencing that and not just the survivors.
---
I don't think anyone except devs on the reddit know what's going on. Nobody here knows the inner workings of the code of this game. Dedicated servers won't fix everything, but they will certainly alleviate many problems caused by hosts running this game with a toaster, desyncing being biggest problem of them all.
---
Or just do nothing because it’s  really not a big deal. 
---
I'm actually an outlier, tbh. I am the wild card character, because I play one of two ways: Black Ace (Plunderer's, Ace's, and typically self-care/iron will), giving items to my teammates from the chests and doing gens, occasionally hook saving, giving other people the gates to open and planting my body in front of them when unlocking so the killer can't reach them...or, I play with Stake Out, Diversion, Small Game, and Urban Evasion, and just annoy the killer as much as possible, being a massive distraction so my teammates can do the gens, or to find hex totems, or really just to take the piss. However, when doing either of these things, I will wear the non-matching head and pants (like the jacket being matched with no hat and the police jeans), to signify I am not the average Tapp.
---
If you have Leatherface, definitely level him for bbq if you don't have a goal, it's an amazing perk and normally earns me around 57 thousand points. You don't have to play him to get his perks. Also, how often do you play survivor? It helps to know how other survivors react when the heartbeat appears
---
I almost nutted reading this
---
I can’t speak for thanto. But sloppy and bloodhound are unbeatable together. You will NEVER lose a chase with that combo. Try it out, and see what you think. When I play killer (survivor main) 
---
I use enduring, sloppy, bloodhound, and bbq chili
---
I would use thanatophobia with nurse calling 
---
Or
---
Sloppy if you prefer bloodhound.
---
Its random
---
Tbh use thanatophobia, it’s more useful than sloppy.
---
Nice hat, at least you were productive! I have been mostly on youtube between games!
---
It’s all RNG. 
---
I just need something to slow the game down more since rim gets taken out so fast 
---
Because I don’t want to fight the same SWF group over and over. I also like my Ruin lasting more than 2 seconds. 
---
I don’t leave either. But for a lot of people killer was stressful enough and the event has well broken them. Now they are either doging any potential SWF group, playing survivor only, or taking a break from the game. 
---
Hence the lengthy queue times for survivors. 
---
Have you tried praying to the entity. If so have you tried giving sacrifices to the entity for better rng
---
The entire fortnite community seems to act like this isn't true
---
Having issues using a toolbox on gen. It won't allow it. Has anyone else had this issue?
---
Until someone dies or more than 1 I heard 
---
What about using both together ? Would that do anything 
---
If only that movie burnt up with the rest of the Jedi texts
---
I wish BHVR would refund legion from the game entirely lol
---
If someone dies halfway through the trial, that pretty much decides the game.
---
This is one of like 5 vault spots that's bugged. I thought it was in the patch notes that this shit was fixed, but it's not like that matters ..
---
he didnt censor his name up top lol
---
You understimate the powers of a bad nurse
---
I do during bloodpoint events. I burn a BPS, bring WGLF, and get the x2 event points. With a map, I can just focus on hook saves, totems, and chases without doing gens, and STILL get a ton of objective points for the map.
---
Then you go "OOF" behind the tree because you have a boo-boo and she 180's so fast her hatchets fly off.
---
This... this isnt a prequel
---
Great job with the hat!
---
Mad how long me and my wife have been waiting in lobbies since the event started...
---
This game..smh..lol 
---
I wonder if that's what the producers felt too after seeing the final reel before release.
---
Same rarity as any other perk.
---
I'm glad people got pictures of The Legion's faces. Suzie's mask made no sense to me, especially the description, after finding out she has braces.
---
Nobody loves Claudette 
---
Holy hell I hope you are joking 
---
I am also having this issue currently and I hope they fix this soon. It's VERY frustrating...
---
So it’s not just me? I think survivor:killer is like 20:1
---
It’s getting a little frustrating.

Haunted Ground lights two hex totems. If you know there is no Ruin or Lullaby then don't break it. If you notice that it has been 5 hooks and no devour hope, don't break it.
---
Maybe because I have xbox one x ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
F
---
I believe you can still derank back to 16-20 from the monthly resets, just not from depipping.
---
Sloppy
---
If you think about it, it's the prequel to Episode 9
---
It’s a dick move and shitty to go against if you’re the survivor, but honestly I’d rather be tunneled than camped because at least it’s good practice. 
---
Unless you’re one of those killers who have hard ons for getting a 4K every game it’s better to just go for the person unhooking than the one getting farmed. 
---
Leader was changed but is still an amazing perk it just doesn't affect gens.  25% heal speed with two survivors equals We'll Make it for everyone.  Also exit gates and hex cleanses especially when Thrill is in play.  It's quite strong in swf 
---
2 kills are not required for a pip
---
Yeah but.... 25% faster vaulting dude 
---
of course it's a DS problem. always is.
---
So you had 1 shitty game against it and think its broken? Lol.
---
We got a 2nd PS4 last month purely for DBD.
---
FB Marketplace had loads super cheap and we ended up paying  £100 for a white PS4 Slim.
---
Ever since we have played almost every night!
---
As opposed to the constant posts about DS and Tbagging in exit gates?
---
coulrophobia is real man. it sucks :(
---
Darn.
---
When people say rank doesn't matter, they mean it's a measure of play time, not skill. Obviously, when someone hasn't played enough to get out of rank 20, their skill will be far below someone who has played enough to get to rank 1.
---
I love these sorts of montages lmao
---
8 bloodwebs lol? It took me 115 bloodwebs to get BBQ tier 1 on my Legion. I have all the perks but it’s just luck man. Sometimes it goes in your favor other times you will curse the worthless grind.
---
This game is going to die because SWF makes playing killer fucking awful. It's a literal cancer 
---
Yeah I've just got my social studies book out and have been reading it in-between wait times:/
---
Lmao ankle is literally just killer ochido
---
Nope none of us use DS guy and it still happens every once in a while again NOED first trigger often sets it off when it happens.
---
I purposely stay in yellow ranks, so people figure it out quick
---
Oh we might have to look into that. I still don’t think he would play DBD regularly though, he would rather play Overwatch, RDR2 and other games. 
---
This sub upvotes anything
---
I meant dedicated servers lol
---
Nah, he’s a ghillie seus. The most camouflaged poet ever. 
---
Turn on V-Sync. It will cap the fps at your monitors refresh rate and it will look a lot smoother without screen tearing.
---
Oh lol.  I got you.  I was gonna say wrong crutch 
---
Well I believe that there are around 12 universal killer perks, and then each killer can add up to three additional perks, so a total of ~54 perks I believe? So if you have everything unlocked the chances of you getting a specific perk is 1 in 54 or about 1.8%, and you have to get that perk three times to max it out. Even if you just want to get BBQ&amp;Chilli as a teachable, that means that you would have already gotten Knock Out, so it would be ~1 in 14 or 7.1% chance per bloodweb.
---
Why would you want the moonlight cosmetics anyway? For survivors, you stand-out like a sore thumb, in the red costumes. Makes you a target.
---
Just tell the next urban immersion Claudette what perk you're trying for and she'll mention it to the Entity at the next killers meeting.
---
Well I like how they look I’m just saying that was the whole thing that made me excited for events before, a cosmetic that is only available for a limited time. Now you can just buy them so it’s not very special 
---
Same error. Maybe something went wrong?
---
Be cool, stay in school! 
---
Same. Rip
---
As far as I know there is nothing you can do. You just need to learn how to turn and time the keys right so you don’t lose momentum.
---
lol SWF are usually overly altruistic and easy to counter...not sure why people dodge them. Unless they they are god tier in a chase, you can down multiple people pretty quick. 
---
Sorry bro I’m not an immersed survivor who wastes time sitting in corners. I’m either getting chased or I’m doing gens. I don’t care about hiding. There’s no fun in that for me
---
Detected the NOED nurse player.
---
Getting disconnected right after offerings are burned but the screen stays black. Only the audio plays when escape is pressed, no menu. 
---
No it's not that it was one bad game. It's because the killer clearly didnt do anything, and the outcome is easily repeatable. Rancoring followed by a hook camp is an easy 2 kills everytime. That's why I'm bringing it up, because I cannot think of a solution to that other than spending every game cleansing every totem before we exit.
---
Yeah, it started working for me as well. Weird.
---
Still have yet to see someone properly utilize this loop so as of now I have no problem with this lol will be something to keep in mind when I play survivor tho
---
Its called the killer having butt internet
---
sweet jesus
---
I dont play nurse. Jokes on you :)
---
lil
---
standard salty survivor main thread that got outplayed. 
---
Downvoted.
---
Cool story man
---
Really? I thought it was 2 kills and BP consideration but maybe that was before new rank system.
---
Trapper is so much fun once you learn the maps well enough to know trap placements.  Also he can turn a very ugly game around at the drop of a pin particularly against swf.
---
I don’t know where. I remember seeing an ‘OchiDO EXPOSED’ video a while back with them.
---
I'll never let go, David. I'll never let go.
---
I agree. You can get as low as 6 pts, playing as killer and easily around 20 as survivor. You play killer only because of the long queue times, or because you are a complete masochist.
---
Oh. I didn't know us reddit pieces of shit were allowed to have an opinion on such things. 
---
I'm on PS4.  Maybe I shouldn't use it then 
---
"Increases the other Survivors' Healing, Sabotage, Unhooking, Cleansing, Opening Exit Gates, and Chest Search speeds by15/20/25 % when they are within 8 metresof range from you."
---
It doesn't affect you, and it has nothing to do with vaulting speed.
---
I main killer, but I never really try because I hate high lobby Times. I get the pleasure of deranking on survivor because of swf, I don't want to do it on killer too
---
A great game to play of everyone has their messages open is tell them you're playing hide and seek, first one to find you can have hatch
---
Blue Susie and the dropout mask are my go to! 😋
---
Pretty much. Even if you’re good as killer, the points just don’t come close. Oh well, just keep the hands busy while in queues. I’ve turned of menu music and started playing spotify while I wait. Lol
---
I'm just curious as to how one quantifies this.
---
I played it a lot more back on the old rank system. I play Billy, huntress, spirit and occasionally doctor. I occasionally used to run noed on the huntress because I didnt really like a lot of the other perk synergy for her. I am willing to admit I picked up plenty of kills on it on games where I played like ass. 
---
Regardless, rank ups aside it is simply not fun to do well the whole match and then watch at least two teammates die running to power a gate because the killer gets 2 massive steroids for allowing survivors to get 5 generators done. Perhaps the synergy with rancor is the unpleasant part, but to say the killer deserves 2 kills for just allowing the survivors to complete the objective is silly to me.
---
not sure on how far ps4 is behind 
---
David Tapp mains? Does anyone play David Tapp? 
---
I love finding a blue Feng when I'm blue Susie! 💙 Its fate!
---
This shouldn't be an add-on, this should just be inherent to his kit.
---
Thank you sm!! 💙
---
I hear you but let’s say it goes like this: wait 30
---
Min for a game to only get 2-3 gens before you die (some games for me) for 12 points and little to no bloodpoints  or wait 2 min for a killer game with more bloodpoints and hook survivors at least 2 times each, sometimes 3 and get 16 (that’s 2 hooks on each survivor) and maybe you hit some vessels... 
---
I just don’t always like playing killer, so I’m suffering through some long wait times. 
---
From my experience, Nea mains take the aggro a lot.
---
First of all, I don't play that much, just a few hours the past couple of days. And second, Thrill of the Hunt is a blessing and a curse. If the survivors aren't that good they try to cleanse the totems right away. But especially once you get (close) to the red ranks, they tap the totem, run away and hide, do that constantly, with multiple people doing that at the same time. Then it's really hard to actually hook people before the totems get destroyed.
---
Just because you play the nurse it doesn't mean that it's a piece of cake. It takes a lot of effort and skill to be good with her.
---
Depending on how well you handle information overload, Spies from the Shadows might be better than ANC on that build.
---
Quentin should be purged from existence. Nobody plays Quentin anyway; nobody would even notice.
---
love it
---
Exactly, don't show the part where the teammate gets downed seconds later and hooked again! 
---
Agreed. He's great
---
You get the camelot and the keys welcome to the truenity :)
---
The Others are sending their message to him from the Island. 
---
I definitely main Hag, though I occasionally play Spirit and I'm trying to learn Billy. I would argue to the fullest that she's one of the most effective killers, if you know how to play her, like you said.
---
Ah you know what I haven’t tried the reworked spies yet I have been meaning too.  Not sure I have it on my clown but I have all perks on a couple killers I’ll have to try it. 
---
Is that the legendary p4 claudette ?
---
You might want to look into getting a controller and remapping the keybinds to favor your left hand.
---
I’m not one to get all butthurt ab random shit but the entirety of Michael’s character and his scariness is within the mask. In the new Halloween, they not only never show his face, they also have a scene in the beginning where he literally feels the mask’s presence and evil. It’s the entire ordeal. So taking the mask away just kinda takes away the entire killer. And also his eyes look like he’s the main character of some cheap anime 
---
When you run Thompson’s moonshine in both slots
---
Why is the reddit icon in the back?
---
same here 
---
Thank you, HuntressHelpAhh, very cool
---
Oh, my bad I thought you were being completely serious. Sorry friend 
---
Precisely. For Ace can obliterate the locker god with the flick of only one finger.
---
You can't really lose the killer if they just hang out at a certain distance behind you while being able to leap pallets and windows at a really fast speed - and I play stealthily. 
---
Did you play as nurse on ps4 on the Thompson house???
---
yep there it is
---
you guys are all dicks
---
You should just habitually say gg and just go if you aren’t wanting to deal with it. And at least you can deal with annoying people in game like you can. I just intentionally ignore them and kill the others. 
---
Ok, and report for not being dbd related content. Aaaaand bam. My work here is done. /s
---
not for a long time. nurse was always too hard for me
---
I mean, I knew Legion was gonna be high on average BP and low on kill rates, but I admit I did not expect him to be literally first place and last place respectively.
---
But overall I don't think there's too many surprises in the kill rates.
---
Hillbilly is a relatively easy to use speed demon with an instadown. He appears from across the map and then you die. Ask not for whom the chainsaw revs - it revs for thee.
---
Doctor and Hag both make basic required objectives (doing gens and rescuing teammates respectively) excruciatingly slow and dangerous. Their power simultaneously slows survivors down while chaining into more chases and punishes. They're also pretty damn easy to play.
---
Shape is my first real surprise - he's that high, really? He's mostly a standard M1 killer who trades not chasing/attacking for building meter that he can use to instadown later. I do think BHVR has that trade-off pretty well-tuned balance-wise, but it's also pretty easy to fuck yourself and give up too much map pressure going for stalk.
---
I expected Spirit, Nurse, and Huntress to be Doctor/Hag level. All three have a power that is both a gap-closer and a loop-breaker. Spirit can press M2 to catch up to a survivor, or turn almost any tile in the game into a mindgame. Nurse can press M2 to catch up to a survivor, or ignore almost any time in the game entirely. Huntress can do the devastating point blank throw -&gt; melee combo if she catches you somewhere vulnerable, and beyond that she can actually hit you at range and her power lets her play almost every loop in the game in her own unique way. But I guess they are all harder to play than Doctor/Hag, so on *average* Doctor/Hag perform better.
---
Pig is the second real surprise, but I guess the time required to get through four helmets is no joke - and in the end DBD is a game about competitive time management.
---
Cannibal is a standard M1 killer who can instadown you if he catches you too far away from a pallet or vault. Hillbilly with none of the map pressure, but an instadown is an instadown.
---
The cliff between Wraith and Nightmare is interesting. What are Wraith and Nightmare? They're standard M1 killers whose power maybe-kind-of-sort-of lets them sneak up on people and start a chase from an advantageous position. But Wraith is at 65% while Nightmare is at 54% because 1) Wraith doesn't have a terror radius, if you're inside a jungle gym you might not know he's there until he shimmers around the corner or BING BONGS, and 2) Wraith can also use his power as a gap-closer to catch up after first hit.
---
Clown is in the between Wraith and Nightmare at 58.2, and honestly that seems about right. What is Clown? He's a standard M1 killer whose power shaves maybe 1 loop off most tiles. That's almost nothing. 90% of the time you could do that by moonwalking.
---
And then, Trapper - the killer whose power is so worthless a better name for him would be 'man with machete.'
---
And then, Legion - the killer whose power is so worthless a better name would be 'kid with knife and 110% movespeed.' I mean, fuckin' seriously. Look at that mini-cliff between Trapper and Legion.
---
After clicking the slider, click on the bar under it "Closing in". If you readjust the music, press the slider then click the box of text again.
---
Okay now who’s the real pig?  Leatherface, Huntress, or Amanda?
---
T/wooooosh
---
lol
---
Thanks m8
---
Why start with “I mean”
---
I believe I found something like that on Ironworks one time. Where a tree and rock were like that.
---
It’s almost sad but almost also good at the same time? It’s like it’s almost forcing us to be productive during the wait times! Maybe pick up an audio book and see how many chapters you can get through!
---
Killers never stay down, they rise up 
---
Even against SWF I can at least get 2 kills most of the time
---
i was. but i didn't know about what he was doing outside of videos. so not anymore.
---
When adrenaline and haunted grounds pop at the same time
---
Drunk billy, what did you do this time? XD
---
I guess I tend to associate them with just crouching and sitting in corners doing nothing the moment the killer hooks someone.
---
Thank you! Does Nea have a purple beanie cosmetic? If not she needs one lol
---
oh that might have been it. because it looked fine to me and even got the points
---
[my progress looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/SPSI3FB.png)

Unpopular opinion here but I hated what they turned Luke into. His character was so shitty and nonsensical it kind of shit all over the hero we all knew for decades. At the very least I can't see him ghosting on his sister for so long and when he finally does something it's so exhausting that it causes him to fucking vaporize. Mark Hamill originally didn't like what they did with the character either. I feel like they're destroying the old world so they can do whatever they want. 
---
Bring a Mori or use op addons 
---
Based on Ace's fate, it seems he accepts his fate
---
Play with killer if you want solo, it's quite fun if you don't end up with SWF groups all the time. At least you'll see the other end of the tunnel and how shitty is to fight against a team with flashlights, relentlessly looping you, taunting you, running around you and so on, while you're level 10-15 or so and they are clearly red ranks. 
---
I stopped playing survivor at rank 5 because I end up with SWF of 3 that mock the killer so hard that I feel bad for him/her. The game should be all about not knowing where the killer is, what killer is until you encounter it or observe the powers used (where applicable), who is s/he chasing, SWF kills the whole purpose of the game.
---
It makes you uninstall the game with those people. 1 person can't outsmart 4 coordinated ones.
---
I wouldn’t mind a telekinetic killer. Call her jean grey 
---
My thought is not enough incentive to play killer (which could also be the rise in killer buffs and survivor nerfs.)
---
Could also be solo players have priority and SWF are more “filler” for spots.  Its possible they try to match solo people all toughest, 2 man teams with other 2 man teams but when it comes to 3 man it’s harder and for some reason, even harder for 4 man teams. The wait times for solo are longer now but not AS long as SWF. 
---
Could also be ranks. I have found myself as a rank 1 in a match with rank 8s maybe because it was just too hard to find that next person to fill it. I try to play with my friends and they are rank 10-8 and I feel the game is trying to find a good average rank killer and solo players of the same rank are priority. Who even knows lol
---
On PS4 I usually play against this guy who was usually really friendly and would help me out.
---
I had a ritual to kill someone as hag and as soon as I hooked him he killed himself. Then I chased his friends and they both DC’d. The last one I let escape through the hatch.
---
Dude I was so upset because I’ve had the ritual for weeks now and never got a mori on hag.
---
Yeah, I am not sure whether I just got lucky or they patched it recently.
---
Some of the animations were in a wall or hill, so I just used the part where you couldn't notice it. Only with ace you can see the wall a bit.
---
Not sure what you're trying to say there sport.  Decisive is a get out of jail free card for getting outplayed and downed just like NOED is a get out of jail free card for getting outplayed as a killer.  Baby crutches for both sides of the game.
---
How?
---
H3H3 would be proud!
---
How is using comms not broken?
---
it allows survivors to track literally everything in the game and coordinate in a huge way that's not intended 
---
like none of you are even responding to what's in my post. I don't know why I expected anything else
---
In regards to personal skill cap, I'm ignorant enough to believe you set those limits on yourself and only you can choose to raise that bar. This is not a shot at your character, just keep pushing those caps a limits.
---
Can we stop the cheap karmagrab?
---
P3 Tapp here, Do gens, save everyone, get mori'd. Gotta rp as him as best as I can. 
---
This is dumb 
---
3 vessels (lost 2 but exit with one), a lot of chase points, stun, gen and heal
---
If it's my buddy I make less of an attempt lol. 
---
The hardest choices require the strongest will
---
you can't reasonably improve when you're placed with people much above your skill level.
---
life isn't an anime where you git gud by being beat up by a legendary sensei 9 times a day
---
Don't mind the toxic survivor mains in here. Just dodge SWF like most of us do. It happens for a reason.
---
But there's so many builds he tries and makes work without ruin! 
---
you get 500 points for holding the lamp every couple mins so he most likely held onto it the majority of the game 
---
I’m talking about even before this event. I suppose it’s only going to get worse now 😢 bye friends

This developers are trash. I wish a good studio would make their own version.

You hate women, confirmed.

Odd, don't know why I was downvoted though.
---
Camping when the gates are open (not powered, open) often isn't an incorrect choice.
---
You couldn’t just have gotten rid of the transparency 
---
Damn
---
Don't focus down one survivor, or just down them quickly. I've gone against a countless number of SWF, and I still usually get 4ks. If you can't get kills, it's just your skill level. All you gotta do is react and predict well. Don't just run in a straight line after 1 survivor.
---
Do they like beanies or people crocheting while playing games? 
---
Wait are people seriously saying this ? I have lost hope on everything 
---
Nah, it's a flat out retcon. Part 1 Freddy probably didn't have a kid or a wife if we go by Wes Craven's design for him, but they gave him one in part 6. Plus, it being an "explanation" doesn't mean it's not a retcon, lmao. On top of that, the fear thing only really came into play in Freddy vs Jason. So that doesn't count either. Like I said, I think the relationship between Freddy and the Entity is one of business partners.

but will they set off trapper trap

I use the same build, except that I have Discordance instead of BBQ.
---
I tried for a while Sloppy, but I saw no results, maybe I was a noob.
---
How would Sloppy work, really? I didn't notice any difference with that, I hit the survivors and they heal immediately.
---
This ain't cheap karmagrab. If you want cheap karmagrab, you should go to r/memes and repost memes.
---
So you’re telling me that after 18 moris none of them had you or the survivor clipping into a wall or object?
---
SUSPICIOUS
---
With my friends, we have a "No Ruin" rule in KYF matches because... It will just become a totem hunt and the killer is going to have a wasted perk slot for probably nothing. 
---
As a result Thanatophobia has become a staple choice for a few of us to slow generator progression, while others prefer a more involved form of interference for gen protection (Discordance, Surveillance, etc). From the matches we have played together, I have noticed that Thanatophobia does slow down matches, and provide opportunities for killers because people are trying to heal instead of doing gens or ignoring healing and working through Thanatophobia because of Sloppy. 
---
It ultimately depends on your playstyle as a killer, but it can be quite helpful especially if you are playing Legion.
---
Sometimes it really be like that 
---
Myers' mask is actually a mask of William Shatner as Captain Kirk.
---
Yeah, this is the most likely reason. 
---
Man I should take up something like crocheting, its awesome seeing stuff like this. Lol that you do it during lobby time haha. 
---
The wait times are proof that matchmaking needs to change during events. Also in general there needs to be frequent balance changes and updates. Theres basically two updates that change how the game is played - DLC updates because new perks new map new killer and the mid season patch updates. There should be like bi weekly perk changes and perk balancing for unused perks - like they did to alert and surveillance. Alert went from worst perk in the game to top 5 aura perk in the game with one change
---
Because both are true. Legion is borderline the worst killer in the game if you're not using franks or wound study. Legion has bad kill rates otherwise.
---
On the flip side, he can tunnel one person into the ground and they can't do anything about it because you can't avoid being hit once and then moonwalked to death.
---
Yeah, it was ugly. I hooked I think all of them at least once or twice and got bombarded by so many flashlights, teabags, and body-blocking...it was unreal.
---
It’s sad it’s like that, so the killers you get have to work extra hard to make it worth it. Hope you’re finding some new music!
---
😂
---
Im losing faith in this community
---
I agree that this would be nice.
---
Having never stepped in my own trap while carrying someone.
---
Can’t lose faith if you already lost it
---
It was down for a very short period of time. You had to restart DbD to be able to play again instantly though. It probably came back up before you launched the game. 
---
They did, but I hid it. You can see a clipping wall with Ace. One Nea is buried in a hill and a Meg is in a pillar on the Saw map
---
Yeah, it's totally my fault for missing the skill check when the needle literally skips the whole zone...
---
Or you dont? Either you escape and keep your shit  or someone else can take it.(which is quite common in swf groups) Killers cant keep theirs.Not even with a 4k they keep their addons. Also its quite more annoying to get these in the bloodweb.
---
I see no problems in using wards. I rarely see them anyway.
---
Ah, ok. Nicely done in that case!
---
Is there some recap for lost? I like the story and setting but everyone says the ending sucks so i dont want to invest that much time into it only to be disappointed
---
Dont judge my build I forgot to switch character
---
A) Are you really saying that Totems aren't a part of the game, and rewarding players for going out of their way to get them even when they aren't active is a bad idea? The fact that you think "Cleanse Totems, get a bonus to all Bloodpoints" is complicated to the point of "Get bloodlust, find snacks, can't chase, hit said snacks" is more of a horrible way to prove your point than to disprove mine....
---
B) There would obviously be something else to the perk, it's not like it would only be get the blood points. Say, Cleanse Totem, reveal killer for a few seconds, get bonus bloodpoints for cleansing totem.
---
C) Are you saying that it's intuitive to help newer players understand that cleansing totems is important and while also helping to teach them where the totem spawns are?
---
Finally
---
D) The perk doesn't "help" killers in the strictest sense; Survivors are given increased bloodpoints for cleansing totems, some other benefit on top of that, and they prevent Hexes from being used/NoED from appearing. The fact that it slows down the game for the killer is about as indirect of "help" that you can get considering you'd have less of a chance for NoED spawning and more of a chance that the survivors find your Ruin. 
---
Brigitte?
---
I WANT THIS AS A NEW GAMEMODE!!!
---
??
---
completely agree, and if you're going to destroy the old world at least fuffing respect it
---
lmao i guess my reddit was tripping bc there was a play of the game from overwatch as the thumbnail lol 
---
I love my David King Jacket and the (Less exciting) Hound Huntress mask from last Lunar event. While the new Huntress outfit definitely looks great, I certainly feel less accomplished knowing I could have just paid for it instead.
---
Oh shit the video was dead by daylight tho right? It’s another video of mine where I miss every swing and still get potg. I meant to link a legion glitch
---
I cant even blane survivors for being immersed anymore. Legion being in the game is reason enough to play immersed at the start
---
&gt;A) Are you really saying that Totems aren't a part of the game, and rewarding players for going out of their way to get them even when they aren't active is a bad idea?
---
Yes, I'm saying that if I have no incentive to do them outside of a NERF to a perk, that ONLY helps the killer, then yes, that's a bad idea. Perks should never help the killer(No mither is a weird exception, but it's not 100% killer favoured)
---
&gt;B) There would obviously be something else to the perk, it's not like it would only be get the blood points. Say, Cleanse Totem, reveal killer for a few seconds, get bonus bloodpoints for cleansing totem.
---
Terrible, really. 'Reveal the killer for a few seconds' - Feng min has a considerably better version of your suggestion and it's still rarely used
---
Newer players won't get WGLF because they have no idea what they're doing, and usually pick bill without instructions, and Meg or Claudette if they do get instructions
---
&gt;D) The perk doesn't "help" killers in the strictest sense;
---
It slows down the game, which exclusively helps killers, while also making survivors fight over the totems. There's nothing good about this change. Shove We'll make it onto it. Simple, efficient and it becomes a much more viable perk
---
Event isn't the best. Probably worse than Hallowed IMO. Stick to the themed gens and hooks for now - this stuff just promotes shitty plays from either end.
---
That’s a good chuckle
---
Really smart... Not wasting your time waiting.
---
.... You do realize that I never stated I wanted WGLF to be changed, right? Just that it misses the mark of a BP boosting skill and that totem cleansing would have been a better thing to base it around.
---
Also, BBQ already helps the Survivors greatly by making Killers not want to Tunnel, so it's a perk that helps Survivors.
---
Settle the hell down, dude. "Why aren't people already rescuing their team mates?", "Why don't the Killers just not tunnel people?" are very good questions you could ask of We're Gonna Live Forever or BBQ and Chili as well. Doesn't stop those from being great perks (barring abuse from WGLF)
---
I highly doubt that killers at max rank are camping for pips. They can't gain them, and nobody wants to maintain rank 1 for any reason.
---
I still don’t get any event progression
---
*Accidentally bodyblock teammate*
---
PC eu. I see Noed maybe 20/25% of my red ranks games
---
How the hell did it go from almost done back down to 15% done?!?
---
Nice sync. Well done OP!
---
restart the game
---
I had the exact same issue, I escaped with the vessel and I didn't get any points
---
The only buff freddy needs
---
(X) Doubt
---
***THATS ILLEGAL*** 😡
---
I disagree gold for you
---
Lots lots lots .. If you play on a regular basis 3 dc won't get you banned
---
No, I'm not saying change WGLF....
---
*ZZZZZZZZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
---
thank you so much friend 😭 ily
---
You realise that all 4 survivors cant get full stacks with the actual perk aswell? 
---
With the NOED buff, it wont change much. Will make survivor takes 1 to 2 slots to get BP, (WGLF+Small Game), helping killer since they will have to make choices on perk.
---
And i’d rather have survivor rush on totems, instead of rushing unhooks to get their 25% bonus BP right in front of the killer.
---
Seems like every time I get the lunar vessel out, the event is suddenly broken again.
---
R/softwaregore
---
it requires 12 hooks not just a 4k
---
45 is the cap for both killers and surviez
---
My channel is 12 years old there are a LOT of dead subs in my subcount, nothing compared to noob &amp; monto who have built their channels up over the last few years. They have a much more active viewerbase
---
it's 2 per hook and 3 per lamp https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Moonrise
---
Thanks very much
---
Camping is trashy and not even fun (I’m a killer main) but when survivors bum rush hooks 0.1 seconds after I get a hook, I don’t have many options 
---
I did but points didn't update so either it's fixed for my next game or it's still bugged 
---
But survivors aren't getting 45pts per game on average, that's just the max. I would say I usually get between 12-20. I've only gotten 45pts 2-3 times.
---
Same. I guess the bug is back.
---
Two words: bears baptism
---
Well I don't think its good design to make survivors compete against each other over bloodpoints. You are just taking the selfish design of current WGLF and using it for something else. Something other than limited number of totems should be used. Escaping chases for example. I don't know.
---
I've had someone crush it even when I didn't pick it up and I was first downed and hooked
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
"Hmm...I'm the only one who's not on Final Hook and that Claudette on the hook is about to die. I've just opened the Exit Gates. No one else is probably gonna go save her because if they get caught, they're dead too. But if I go save her, we'll just trade places...."
---
\*10 seconds later\*
---
"Save yourself, Claudette! Run!"
---
\*10 seconds after that\*
---
"Welp, I'm hooked and everyone else has gone out the Exit Gates. RIP me, I guess."
---
Idle hands are the entities play thing. 
---
Accurate 
---
At 18pts a game you only need 250 games to get the cosmetics.....this is the first event I’ve skipped but F the amount of pain this would take, hell my first 4 matches ended with the killer dc’ing as soon as the last gen was done. I miss the old style events like the last lunar event, before all this added side crap started getting used where I’m actively forced to screw over other people if I intend to get enough points.
---
I mean, I'm not debating that it sucks that the max is different for killers vs. survivors. It definitely sucks. But we definitely aren't getting the max anywhere near every game.
---
*than 
---
Not everyone uses WGLF so it stands to somewhat reason that not everyone would run Totem Destroyer Perk either. I also feel the need to point out that WGLF's selfishness is quite a bit different than destroying Totems as well.
---
If destroying Totems was a perk that gave additional blood points, other players just couldn't get the blood points (Though they'd hopefully get the benefit of the other half the perk, depending on what it is). With WGLF, that selfishness can actively screw over another survivor by getting them repeatedly downed and hooked in a short order.
---
You're not going to get the proof you're looking for, because it doesnt exist.
---
There is no such thing as a friendly Legion, that is a glitch in the matrix
---
And survivors get on average ~20 a game
---
&gt; blaming their Lack of skill on the game is just wrong
---
It’s broke on xbone too. #feelsconsoleman
---
*Smooth transitions*
---
You should!! There are so many cool and practical things you can make now that doesn’t look like grandma stuff. I made some [dragon scale fingerless gloves](https://imgur.com/gallery/I5Pknai) back in December and I’ve gotten lots of compliments on them, and they keep my hands warmer! You can find a lot of good online resource to teach yourself 
---
And I agree on all those points! I got my game for free back in September I think when it was available on PS4 so I can’t complain too much about it, but I do appreciate when they work on things. I just wish the match making and queuing was better. They do *try* to make you play killer more with daily rituals (and you get more blood points for the things too) but this event they didn’t at all. So sad. 
---
w-why didnt you just take a screenshot
---
Restarting my application seemed to work for me, I escaped through the hatch with the vessel and got my points
---
good, dont play the way your Opponent wants, play how YOU want :D
---
Actually, quantum mechanics forbids this.
---
something i thing bhvr could do is add a 4m radius around the hook that will show survivors auras within. I mean. its kinda ridiculous that they can see the person on the hook but not the person screwing off near it
---
oh. eh, who knows.
---
ye, thats my opinion.
---
I’m on the east coast, too! Before the event solo was so fast and even 2 SWF was pretty good. But now I can sit in the lobby anywhere from 4-7 min solo and that’s if the killer doesn’t lobby dodge. 
---
Thanks I'll try and bear this more in mind\^\^
---
Very doubtful but an interesting idea
---
Because it’s his mori that causes it 
---
That’s great! I should pick up a book or maybe get an audiobook to listen to while I crochet during the lobby wait,  but I watch YouTube videos instead lol 
---
lol. that was actually hilarious
---
How does this look at all like a white person to you?
---
Gotta say he looks more terrifying with eyes showing LOL
---
How much exactly have you contributed to the team's salary? I highly doubt it's enough to justify skins for everyone.
---
Ngl beautifully made!
---
Ace is always smiling, no matter what.
---
Just because a ton of really bad killers camp doesn't mean that it's the perks fault....
---
Why is it an argument for WGLF that "not everyone runs it and not everyone looks to just farm with it", but for Totem Destroyer it's "Everyone will run it and you'll have three people fighting for a single totem, not doing generators". Do people run these parks or do they not?
---
I mean, a lot of people don't actively go searching for Totems and more of just happen to run into them.
---
And that one person who runs it and "screws over three people by not being on a generator"? Probably saved his entire team in the late stages of the game by preventing NoED from spawning or found the Hex: Ruin totem and cleansed it.
---
Monto would be very angry.
---
I got to crawl around that area a bit, then finally crawled back towards the huntress. It let me leave when I got close to her. 
---
Huh, he looks like Michael Jackson on the right side.
---
it means sarcasm, it's added to things that don't look like a joke but are meant to be. i wasn't seriously calling him an idiot, just joking around.
---
Holy shit man. You sure we watch the same person? I've been watching almost every vid of his on yt for close to a year and catching as many streams as I can, and I've never seen half of the novel you just wrote. He very clearly still enjoys and has fun with the game, and yes, stream snipers, people who sandbag streamers, and people who specifically harass him because they're salty is a serious issue not just for him, but for MANY dbd streamers. You sound like you saw one game where he got genuinely pissed and think that's how he always is.
---
As long as they get out I'm fine with it.  If we both die I'm bummed.  
---
death is not an escape
---
Can I have an olive green one? 
---
The originals set the groundwork, the later ones, specifically part 6, retconned it.
---
No, they actually aren't.
---
Bad connections can cause of desync, but they aren't the *only* thing that causes desync - sort of like how smoking causes lung cancer, but smoking isn't the *only* thing that causes lung cancer.

The 2.5.0 basement bug is a perfect example, because it would happen regardless of connection quality - it was some underlying bug in the server code. I made another post on it in this comment chain, if you want to see a more in-depth explanation of what's actually going on bugs like that.

Filthy Frank doesn’t exist anymore you idiot
---
Well my internet went away for 30s or so, Discord recovered but the game didn't
---
That's what I mean by a points system for Perks, Add-Ons and Items.
---
An Ebony Mori would straight up rule out ANY no item Survivors due to its power and therefore high points cost.
---
I admit this would be a titanic task to balance out but it would be worth it in the end.

My progression is still frozen on the event and I can’t seem to make any progress past 354/400. I’m about nine games in and it hasn’t budged

This is adorable. I love stuff like this, being friendly killer is fun.

That’s a weird way to spell world

Oh damn I didn't expect to get your attention 😅😅 
---
That makes sense. Thank you for clarifying. I discovered you through DBD and thought you were a DBD channel that branched out to other games. I stand super corrected. 
---
On another note thank you so much for making videos and playing the way you do. Your videos are super positive and brilliant and not just your DBD ones.

I find so many “try hards” at rank 20-10, and Moris, 4 tier 3 perks (while the other people have next to nothing), “OP” add ons, and all that shit, compared to my nice games above rank 10 where I often don’t even see survivors using decisive and I haven’t seen a mori unless there is a streamer. I don’t know why people want to bully low ranks as killer or survivor
---
Curious about this. This happened to me except I was playing as survivor and I kept jumping around. Eventually it smacked me right in front of the killer. I just assumed their internet was a potato. 
---
When in conversation, your rank doesnt matter as pretty much anyone with normal thinking skills and motor function can reach rank 1.
---
 However it only matters slightly in-game because of ranks 20-15 and matchmaking. So yes, it does matter. But not really.
---
most of the time on pc its blurry too...and i even lose a few frames every once or so start to a game...strange...

Damn, somebody woke up on the wrong end of a Mori.

Bc I cut his feet off on accident so I had to fix him XD

our boy Tru3 is going to give up on this shit game as soon as MK11 drops. of course he only plays DBD because it pays the bills

Tapp is gonna be my main too, sir you inspire me as a p3.

Deadass have been playing with braindead teammates all day. It’s either I die on first hook, or get farmed. Morons committing to gens with ruin active.
---
He always smiles even if you mori him.
---
This is pretty neat. I'd like to see the Hag's perks in this style. Just so you know, there are a couple of typos. For the wraith's part, the first time I read it i thought it said his boobs were secretly killing people haha. 
---
A new perk designed like this basically removes a perk from the survivors four perk total, leaving them with 3 perks(Or 2 if you use WGLF), which could potentially be hugely impactful. Pair this with a selfish 'Yoink the totems before anyone else finds them' if there's two players, and you basically tremendously slow down the game to nothing but greed. This perk promotes nothing but bad play as its own thing
---
Apparently unclicking "autoadjust" in settings helped a bit.
---
Ok thank you. I got worried there lol.
---
You monster!
---
First of all, these are amazing.
---
Second of all, you should try to do Survivors as Killers as well.
---
Only 1 survivor? I don’t think the speed hack is the only problem.
---
You should probably try to play more killer. Nothing teaches you how to survive better than watching someone screw you over on killer. It also makes you aware of each killer's strengths and weaknesses. I'll give you an example of how it went down for me.  
---
  
---
When I was starting to dabble in killer I was pretty bad at chases as both killer and survivor. Playing killer made me realize something. If the survivor wasn't running directly to the nearest pallet/loop on the shortest route, it gave me a huge advantage. Not only does it take them slightly longer to get there, but as the killer you don't have to chase directly after them to catch them. I found I could run at an angle somewhere between them and the nearest loop. That way I would slowly gain on them, and also force them away from the loop at the same time. When I went back to playing survivor, I knew to look for the shortest route between pallets and loops.
---
Neaaaaarrr farrrrrrr WHEREEVVEERRR YOU ARRRRR 
---
Ah, I feel you. No matter what time of day I play or what rank I am my teammates always complete idiots. 
---
“Hey I can run to this unhook against Hag” - 99% of my teammates
---
Artist is duke-by-daylight on Tumblr, guys.
---
That's got to be a speed hack.
---
Report it to dead by daylight on there forum it has all the details.
---
Haha, thanks! Yeah I was thinking of doing the original 4 survivors as killer too,  maybe.
---
and Im saying, thats fine if you see it that way, but that doesnt have to mean I agree with you 
---
I don’t think it’s a representation of time played either. I see a lot of people with 1000 hours sitting in rank 20 that have been rank 1 before. They just de rank or hack their rank so they can chill out or have an easy game against a newer killer or just a not so good killer. I think the game does take hours into considering though, I’m teaching a new player and we keep finding other new players which is rare for me as I am a higher rank, so once you’ve got your hours up I think nothing matters and you’ll get queued with whoever.
---
Because every single Killer runs the build of BBQ and Chili, Beast of Prey, Thrill of the Hunt, and Distressing as their perks, right?
---
Too true
---
Haha, oops, thanks though!
---
Who the hell calls killers hunters? With the exception of Chinese rip-offs.

He just has a really good gaming chair

No, but bloodpoint gain for survivor is considerably lower than killer. The fact that people would run a completely useless perk for extra bloodpoints makes that painfully apparent
---
This literally just happened to me. We were in a three man game against a hag and this Claudette runs to the hook and unhooks me. I run away to go heal then I hear the TR and the second I get off of healing I automatically fail a skillcheck and she knows where I am.

It would be better with unnerving presence.
