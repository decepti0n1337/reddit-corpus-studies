Yes it’s worth it, however since he’s the only killer you have atm with BBQ and Chilli it’s worth trying to use him if you really need BP.

Jokes on her, bill has left behind
---
You don't HAVE to stand by the hatch for 45 minutes. When that happens its because both sides decided that's how they're going to play.  
---
Good killer perks. Mediocre survivor perks. 
---
when you trigger a hag trap, your screen turns to face the phantasm.
---
You don’t have to, but it’s what a hatch standoff is. They’re frustrating and the survivors always win. 
---
I just been trashing it when it comes up. Unfortunately I got a Legion one instead...
---
Tenacity is a damn good perk, especially paired with "unbreakable"
---
You're blowing it up into something way bigger than it is. A poor word choice.
---
Tenacity seems like it's the only one worth getting to me. I already have the two killer perks and Dwight's part of the base game.
---
Sadly this is true. The only thing that sony ever wants crossplay with is pc, fortnite is a special case. 
---
Yea and i'm saying you never even have to enter into a hatch stand off, you do it by choice. 
---
Because survivors are smaller than killers?
---
sorry for the obs thing but it wouldn't capture Dbd bc it was "not responding" so I had to just capture the screen ;-; the struggle
---
Coming from an attempted trapper main this fat shaming is a big meanie move
---
Man, let's stop. Why are we prolonging an argument about fucking crosshair? Like, if atleast we were talking about a more interesting topic like balance or something. The devs have said it's ok to use a crosshair. You think that makes a player worse? Fine, all the good Huntresses (and survivors) I respect couldn't care less about if people use or don't use a crosshair. Okay?
---

---
So you keep your opinion, which clearly was never open for change, and I keep mine, which you never stood a chance of changing. Is this better? I'm tired of this and if I keep memeing you'll eventually say "you have no arguments so you gotta meme etc".
---
See, everything sorted out. Let's move on.
---
Nothing stacks with We'll Make It.
---
It was probably 15-20 seconds from the book till he started opening lockers. He walked right over to the shack. Could have been luck I guess idk. 
---
Then get rid of the hatch standoff completely by adding a timer or give the killer the ability to close it. 
---
Sloppy Butcher makes it take longer for survivors to heal, giving the killer more time to control the map, delay gens, injure and hook more survivors, etc. 
---
BBQ is good because it gives a point buff, and because it shows you survivor auras when you hook someone. That's excellent information and you can zip off to the next survivor as soon as you hook one!
---
RE: Blood, I just got better at it over time. I don't think there was anything that I did necessarily, for me it was just practice and getting used to the look of blood! Additionally, being aware of how long blood trails will last is useful as well.

I never bothered to level dwight because I managed to get leader from a shrine. Guess now I have to level him for Prove Thyself.

I need a history of the shrine cause I swear this isn't the second time I've seen that detective Tapp perk.

Yeah but that's a double depip. I dont care about being in red ranks but I like the playstyle of the people rank 8-10 and I'd like to stay there.
---
Just depends what you’re used to. If you always use a controller it’ll be easy to aim with one, if you’re used to a mouse it won’t. 
---
EAC is pretty well known for being garbage 
---
Oh undoubtably. But there still is that advantage of ever so slightly more precise movements that could change the length of the chase, or the map knowledge the survivors have.
---
Actual footage of me playing killer btw
---
Fair enough. It's just a different kind of mind game. That's all. You can kind of use them in the chase to shut down loops and make a survivor feel like they have to move away. It's up to you if that classifies as what you are talking about. Guarantee my bias kicked in and I got a little triggered. Don't take my counter argument personally. Just can't be having my favorite withered ghoul be slandered.
---
How is rancor ? 
---
1 lucky bastard and a shirtless Chad fuck an old lady as she tries to draw hopscotch board
---
The reason that was never implemented into the game was because of how killer sided it became. I still haven't seen a suggestion that changes the hatch to a more balanced mechanic instead of making it an almost useless thing to have in the game at all.
---
What they need to do is rework the end game completely when it comes to the gens not all being done and 1 survivor is remaining.
---
It’s all good 
---
I still stand by the idea that the hatch should have a timer. Maybe 3 minutes before it closes. 
---
So then the killer stands on it for 3 minutes and wins? How is this balanced?
---
Thanks man, good job
---
its alright, its like a cheap bitter murmer, plus a free mori, its useful for mori dailies
---
The killer still has to look for it. At the very least what they could do is reveal the hatch’s aura to the killer. 
---
I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone. It seems overnight we went from "Legion is useless" to "Legion needs nerfs" 
---
The killer already has the advantage in finding the hatch since they're faster and don't have to worrying about someone killing them.. 
---
I really feel like you don't understand freddy dude, I just described three different ways in how he can be played, hes a well-designed killer because hes versatile, if anything should be reworked about him it should only be number buffs, his power is what makes him, well,him, and shouldn't be changed. If you get rid of the power, you get rid of the identity, and if they dare even touch his power he'll literally just fall into an M1 Killer zone like Myers, and Myers does pretty terribly in high ranks.
---
You didn't have to brag about having bbq 😥
---
Bc white Redditors are literally the most fragile people on earth 
---
They also don’t have a map that can track the hatch. Unless they see where it is before it opens they have no idea where it is. 
---
do you have letherface?

Ya that’s what I’m saying like if the killer hits that’s fine but don’t show me (Survivor) that he missed. Me getting hit by a swing that doesn’t look like it should hit pisses me off more than a hit that does hit. Like me and my friends have been saving multiple clips of horrible missed swings that have actually done damage 
---
Looks like Touka from Tokyo Ghoul in the last picture if you swap that mask for a rabbit one.
---

---
How many survivors do you seriously see carrying around maps that can track the hatch? In my 1,000 hours of play time I legitimately don't think I've ever seen someone find the hatch by using a map..
---
!test!
---
Maybe after the change they’ll start bringing them.

Freddy is nothing like a sad case, he isn't a bad killer, he isn't a non-versatile killer, he has three viable builds, which is more than some killers honest to god, this isn't really an argument I want to have because we both aren't going to budge an inch, I dont want the rework, you do, let's agree to disagree.
---
Freddy is not the best slugger. Is slugging one of the best strats with Freddy? yeah, but killers like Nurse, Billy or even Huntress can slug much better than him, due to their snowball potential.

Once your vs survivors who know how to crouch to evade traps hag, ironically, has a realy bad totem protection game, her traps will not help and she’s 110%ms thus TOTH will be of limited use (not to mention if you are constantly be-lining TOTH notifications, you probs are not putting many traps down, hindering you further)
---
Ok I like this one. If I could upvote it a million times, I would.
---
What is the Spirit perk on there called, and what does it do? Is it worth buying?
---
If you sprint into lockers a notification pops up. Unless you have quick and quiet, my guess is you accidentally sprinted into it and he knew where you were because a notification under the map usually means someone is in the basement
---
Thanks!
---
Rancor. It is like bitter murmur but worse. Your obsession sees you when a gen completes but you do see all survivors for 5 seconds. Once all gens are done obsession is one hit down and you gain a free Mori on your obsession
---
Hahaha right!!
---
BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury Billy. Spamming nod when he gets a down, thoughts?
---
How is pairing leader and prove thyself? I plan on running that with self care and balanced. 
---
Well I mean it's hardly someone's user/ID. 
---
Git gud bby kilr
---
I am a survivor main myself, and I’m also fairly new to the game - I started around (2.1?) when Hag was buffed, so it’s definitely a grind regardless of playing killer or survivor. If you had perks you consider “ideal” on survivor I’d suggest focusing on killer, as it’s easier to farm BPs that way.
---
If you haven’t bought Leatherface DLC, highly worth it for BBQ teachable just for BPs alone. I also highly recommend playing Legion for farming BPs - Frenzy counts for deviousness, you obv get chase points in your drawn-out chases, and you get brutality for hitting survivors during Frenzy.
---
But when I first started playing Killer I started with Huntress. And let me tell you Bitter Murmur/Whispers/Lullaby/Thrill made my games so rough if I couldn’t get hooks. I didn’t mind-game survivors, didn’t know which pallets were considered safe or unsafe, and didn’t know where the “strong” loops were.
---
Also, I find as I go through purple ranks, often times there’s a lot of actual red-ranked survivors that have deranked cause they (a) don’t want to deal with constantly OP add ons (b) don’t want to deal with top-tier killers, or (c) want to have “fun” whether that be at their own expense or the killer’s. Most likely those survivors that are good at looping are good because they shouldn’t be playing against someone at that rank. But I digress, not gonna start a crap storm in the comments about rank vs skill.
---
I do have to say Brutal Strength with Bamboozle seems like an odd set up.  M&amp;A and Ruin are IMO totally fine, but personally I’d drop Brutal Strength for something else. As much as everyone complains, have you considered running NOED? You may be better at late game killers or the “stalling” play style - slugging might be the way to go for you.
---
Just try experimenting a little though, find what perks you like on which killers - it’s taken me a lot of messing around on Legion to find my general preferred build, but also keep in mind you don’t have to use the same four perks every game. Maybe you wanna be a Bitter Murmur/NOED/Blood Warden/Whispers Doc, that’s great. Do what you can early and wreck them late if they don’t want to leave.
---
Do keep in mind if you’re more set on ranking than farming BPs, you will at a certain point have to start punishing survivors for bad plays (primarily unhooks). A big difference between a lot of red rank killers and purple ranks is whether or not they’re willing to punish someone who was farmed by a team mate.
---
Well only one of us is getting downvotes man, and he doesn’t have 3 builds , he may have exactly 3 sets of perks and addons that he can use to stall, but they all do the same thing, he’s bad for the most part, not fun, and doesn’t mesh with the games design, and that’s the overwhelming consensus, but if you wanna keep telling yourself he’s good because you can use very specific things to win, then you can believe that, then I say Meyers is top tier because of the hair tombstone combo
---
Examine your game play to make sure *you* are playing efficiently. I see killers at all ranks make time consuming mistakes, like going the wrong way at t-walls or trying to double-back on safe pallets. Also consider your Wraith-specific strategies.  Also, you probably should have camped; yes it sucks and it's not fun but sometimes you gotta sweat to win.
---
Sadly, as others have noted, sometimes you just have to eat the L. If four survivors know how to chase and are playing efficiently it's natural to get a 0k or 1k. The same is true for survivor, sometimes a killer applies crazy pressure and survivors have to eat the 3k or 4k. Sometimes you just get outplayed, it doesn't have to do with 'balance.' Balance doesn't mean the side that's playing better shouldn't win.
---
I am on pc
---
Killer has 1 person who can get an ultra-rare addon. Survivors have 4 people. It'll be a lot more common than you think, even if Survivors get less BP.
---
Even if it isn't every match, the matches where it does happen will *feel TERRIBLE*. 
---
Oh man, it's notHannibal, notTrapper and notJigsaw teaming up for a bloody good time!
---
Yep, 5 gens left, one on hook and one on floor as he gets lagged to death lol this is one of those games where I just hope we can even unlock hatch at that point.
---
Just finished playing a game against a moonwalking legion :) Feels good i love this game yay :)

Iron Will. Also swap Technician for Lightweight, Quick and Quiet, or Self Care.

With a double hook there's a place with no hooks think about that for a second.

Really only use it when you're right behind a survivor, and in a relatively open space. It slows you down, and even if you're right behind somebody running in a straight line, you'll often only get them on your fourth or fifth swing. Even if there aren't pallets/windows, they can make it difficult to hit them by running around an object. If they do that, I usually just go for the swing. I've hit the object and gone into tantrum too many times.
---
Also if you use Carburetor Tuning Guide + Primer Bulb your saw charges super fast which makes it way easier to get saws, and you can get saws you wouldn't otherwise get due to windows/pallets.
---
Kate is just Tina from DOA now
---
Killer exists
---
Doesnt change the fact that he's boring af to play against 
---
And ?
---
Ahahha J-Hope! Great seeing BTS here
---
It's not that they're not concerned...It's that they have set days for patches they don't do random hotfixes anymore.
---
So we have to hope its in 2.5 later this month.
---
A little back story on this. I had two dailies, complete 3 generators and leave with a new item. I found a sweet new brown med kit early on and went on and did the 3 gens. The last gen I popped was the last gen we needed so I powered up the door and left. I went into spectate to see what the others were doing and watched this guy crawl towards the door for a good 2 minutes. I did not see the killer the entire game nor did I even hear his heartbeat so I had no idea who it was until I saw this.
---
I mean, it'd be weird that they'd go to the effort of putting it in the game files or whatever, then not implement it. They did officially say the event is happening, and cosmetics usually come with an event.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
LF is pretty bad if you do not have the correct add ons. The only add ons that are exceptional on LF are those that reduce charge up time of the chainsaw. Carburator Tuning Guide and Primer Bulb are the best combination IMO. Also, Begrimed Chain can be very powerful if used in a debuff perk build.
---
10/10
---
Just a tip, when you're getting chased you should really turn around more to keep an eye on what the killer is doing. Though, I admit you did well in this gameplay without it
---
Yes. The devs have confirmed only the We'll Make It heal is capped at 100, meaning you cannot get 2 unhooks for 200% healing. It will stack with other bonuses like Botany Knowledge.
---
It really wasn’t though. 
---
I love chasing as Legion... I'm happy finally someone else dislikes the dumb moonwalking strat
---
a powerful fun to play killer. More diversity on high ranks 
---
Well if you decide to play killer a lot more then I would recommend getting the best perks for whoever you decide to main. Meta perks don't always work well for all killers. Perks play a major part in how hard or how easy the match will be for you, so if you want easier games then getting the right perks for the killer you're playing is one of the ways to go. Obviously skill helps, but that can only take you so far since perks do change the game a lot.
---
Obviously getting perks is all rng after they've been unlocked which can get frustrating. So maining 1 killer and getting all their best perks would be the best way to start. 
---
Not really. Anything that doesn't fit the killer hatred circle jerk is usually completely missed. The amount of hypocrisy is actually humorous.
---
I would rather have the smaller terror radius. Combat Straps isn't an addon that's necessary, or even ever worth it compared to most of her trap-related addons. This change is wholly a nerf in my eyes, even if it's a small one.
---
Both are equal 
---
If they made some actual incentive to being rank 1 it would definitely help.
---
I always chuckle a little when I chase a Survivor to the pig vat and they jump in just for me to politely take the stairs to meet them.
---
Fix this shit thanks.
---
I don't think there's been any official word, I assume it's random.
---
LF gets a bad wrap but is pretty decent. He’s an M1 killer who can really punish mistakes and being out in the open. Not the most fun to play, but he can be very effective. 
---

Jk, Mixer doesn't have any streamers.
---
Almost any decent build for a standard killer requires at least 1-2 teachables. Even something simple like Enduring or Spirit Fury along with Brutal Strength And NOED. 
---
What? Wraith and Sloppy is not a Nurse or Machine Huntress. If you have any game over 30 min you are either getting body blocked in the basement or it’s a standoff. Longest game I had was an hour only cause we all decided to hide and not do anything until the killer dc’ed or found at least one of us.
---
Isn't she underaged tho
---
Yes, since you also have BBQ and chilli, youre gonna gain way more bp. Also the best addons for him are decrease chainsaw charge time, makes him kind of alright to use.
---
I believe your supposed to tbag after you drop a pallet on them /s
---
Wraith using Sloppy Butcher is horrendously bugged at the moment. 
---
I hope this is something totally unrelated like some edgy high school band.
---
LOL the blood just pisses me off because it’s near impossible to hide or be immersed at all when there’s bright red sureounding your character at all times, even after healing...
---
And I said match MAKING times mate, not match times. I’m just sick of having to wait 45 minutes to find a lobby any time I want to play on console.
---
I really do enjoy it, they are quite nice
---
Camping makes Survivors genrush faster. Camping to slow down gen rushing is like throwing buckets of oil into an oil fire.
---
I think i have one but im not sure
---
Im new to the game, I have like 5k shards, should I buy Perks or wait until I'm able to buy a new killer?
---
Wraith has a bug where a hit with Sloppy plays the blood splatter animation constantly and makes you really easy to find, and they mean queue times not game times

Double pallets used to be ridiculous and they have removed it from happening about 95% of the time those pallets you see there are 2 unsafe pallets on different tiles. And if you are wondering why I said 95%of the time and not 100% it's because the other day I saw the elusive double pallet on autohaven.
---
How dare he insult the cult of delivery boy Dwight! 
---
…Funny thing is, he has a point. 
---
Flipped ones are NOT cancelled, they just have the  "secret" modifier, meaning no one can see what it is except the person who brought it.
---
A quick google search will show you, safe search on if in public
---
Will they have funky physics like Kate's hair in game is the real question
---
Another awesome thing to do is put a trap at the bottom of that vault. They have literally no control over whether or not they step in it.

This seems like a solution in search of a problem.

Thanks bro, and bravo to you for that beautiful oc! Not enough yugioh memes on this sub.

He probably did, I’ve had 1k games and didn’t depip, so he musta just downed someone and stood around the whole time not getting any other categories satisfied.

Making hatch standoffs not as likely to happen.  We all know the devs won't remove the hatch, so this is likely a better solution.

Yup. You can get to rank 1 as any killer tho

Oh I’ve always known that by Ebonics

It’s weird that people complain about that here, considering how common Ebonics and related slang is used in memes.

I literally just noticed the guy when you mentioned him lol but I’m surprised you almost missed the elephant.

Thank god it comes with a really handy skull indicator.
---
Basically what the other person responded with, though I'll add one thing for the insta-heal and adrenaline:
---
* You're down on the ground? Killer about to pick you up? Someone pops the anti-hemorrhagic syringe on you and you're back to full HP
---
* You're getting chased when there's 1 gen left, about to go down, pretty sure the killer's gonna camp you to secure a kill? Restore your health to full and sprint away while giving the killer a big middle finger 
---
Most likely. I've on occasions played killer where I intentionally letting all of them off after hooking each one once and I still pipped. 
---
those are what we call dead memes **old man**
---
This placement seems counterproductive.
---
With crypress there has to be one survivor though, rancor you can use with all 4 alive
---
Why don't you take a seat over there.
---
It‘s kind of true for Germany at least. English is a mandatory school subject from around 5th to 10th grade, which is the German equivalent of secondary school (exact grades might differ a bit these days though) and can be continued further. It‘s usually still mandatory from grade 10-13 which is the high school equivalent, but you get to choose between standard or advanced courses. I also had to learn a second foreign language starting from grade 7. For this one French is common and also Latin if you are in a „Gymnasium“ school. I think Spanish is also quite popular, but for all languages other than English it depends on whether the certain school offers classes. This was my experience at least.
---
Yes it does. The amount of ebony moris and rare addona I got on p3 compared to p0 is night and day. 
---
If it only said exposed, then maybe.
---
Luckily a spooky skull will also pop up so you have a better idea of what you're in for.

It's pretty weak in my opinion, nothing too crazy.

Impressive, your parents must be very proud 
---
case in point: the replies to your comment 
---
Legion with franks and sws is a tier. I said that in his description. However this is based on no add ons or just regular yellow/green ones. Not their most powerful.
---
Sure thing officer
---
So all you have to do is catch your obsession?
---
Good killers can catch you off guard while you are injured. If you are not close enough to a loop you get downed when you could’ve easily avoided it.
---
Lol no it needs addressing sooner than that bs.

People saying pc is unfair over console... You do know there's a lot of people on pc using a controller right?

It adds a whopping 12 seconds to gens when all 4 are injured, reduced more if the survivor has a toolbox and/or Resilience
---
The Offoce was (and still is) such a funny show!
---
Noob3, jendenise, Zubat, and Angry Pug would not only be a great team but very entertaining as well.
---
That won't work for DS. I think it should be something like deliverance where you need to do a certain thing for it to activate and if you don't use it when it was activated then then you can't use it at all.
---
The Office was (and still is) such a funny show!
---
I play survivor. How who do I have to play as for those perks? Are there certain perks for certain survivors? 
---
I hate this as a Dwight main and love it at the same time
---
I like it &amp; it doesn't sound to OP either. What about a survivor though? 
---
It just wants a god dang hot dog.
---
You must be listening to my conversations because I have said this many times while playing with my friends!
---
Deja Vu isn't a meme. Yes, it's not a good perk for experienced players, but not everything has to be. It helps newer players to get information from the map, and more importantly, continually reveals which gens are best to do to avoid a 3 gen.
---
When i did this i thought about the early unity Slender game, where there was no lore and i honestly like It more and i dont think we need another survivor Just New general perks are good 
---
Isn't it something like unnerving, distressing, huntress lullaby, and overcharge and you just 3 gen and rotate between all survivors constantly putting them in dream state?
---
The government is listening and relaying the messages via Reddit
---
From what I understand about monitor and abuse is that it adds on to your terror radius in a chase. So it would be 24m out of chase and 40 during a chase
---
and yet you were bothered enough to respond...
---
Can you at leazt try to crop the pictures??
---
Godamn this is literally a shitpost
---
Mine would be that Adrenaline/No Mither/Unbreakable no longer wake survivors up. Lightweight needs a buff though.
---
All german streamer Ive met are toxic af, we dont need more
---
Lol. Honestly this would be a pretty cool mechanic, but I think it should only work on prestige games, like you prestige, and you get some points for the stuff you lost. But this would reduce the grind, and I don’t think BHVR wants to do that
---
Fuck legion that is all

god damn has the meaning of the word "meme" become twisted. nice job tho op
---
he did that for 2 and a half hour
---
nonono please continue. where did you find this? 
---
Thanks for the info. 
---
that was 2 and a half hour long, i really wanted my bp
---
Generators are long enough mate you dont want to have any extra time at all. Also, what are you gonna do when the whole team is injured and the Legion just attacks normally with his weapon? You actually believe 12 extra seconds isnt anything? How much killer do you play? 12 seconds add up to 24 then 36, 48 and 60 seconds. Thats 60 seconds wasted because of thanatophobia and because the team didnt heal.

I’ve just recently started watching Morf, hes awesome! His commentary is hilarious, hes really interactive with the chat, and even has a cool sounding voice. He’s a pro. I would include him in my four but I just haven’t seen quite enough of his gameplay yet. Seems really good though.
---
Dont be toxic to killers and they wont be toxic towards you
---
No it didnt lol. Just pick vanessa with a baseball bat and you’re top tier. Also i hate DBDs grindy pekr system but F13s is literal RNG dice rolling.
---
Wow this meme is still going on
---
Yeey
---
But no
---
OMG sick cosplay, It's perfect!!! Keep it up :D
---
well, that seems slightly racist ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Every map has at least 1 drop, and every exhaustion perk gets negged by these addons. 
---
I meant this in more of a sarcastic way as it’s my favourite perk in the game but I guess people didn’t get that?
---
I love how in your example your character is *literally using the word to mean "easily visible"* are you trying to shoot a hole in your own point or

---
Just be honest mate, you were allready called out in your repost
---
Ooh! That's hot. That's reeeeal hot. 
---
Yea , it did . Shift batting ,  shift dodging , stamina management and combat system puts it way over DBD skill cap .  DBD most advance  survivor mechanic is a doing a 360 into the killers auto aim .... 
---
Haha. But I have. Do they want me to unload my whole wallet?!
---
yeah and sometimes words change so much they don't mean the same thing and they we need to make up a new term for the thing they used to represent.
---
HOLY crapoli
---
Every perk except Sprint Burst where you can use it and benefit from it at  the start of a chase. But i see where you're coming from, it basically screws over any killer during a chase.
---
Legion, if they don't go in frenzy, is a 110% MS killer so it'll take a while to get that m1. Also, one whole minute OR fully healing against a legion with Thanato and probably sloppy butcher in effect stretched across an entire match? how long you think that will add up to. Spoilers, it's gonna be longer than a minute
---
Freddy is one of my favorite killers to play. Therefore he is fun to play and you are wrong.
---
Ah yes, nothing like getting tunnled off the hook to get mori'd, how exiting, I did used to main killer and I felt ever so slightly guilty about equiping an ebony, but this is you asking for survivors to stop complaing anout survivors getting mori'd.

Hey thx cutie

I mean, I've helped a ton of people with my first video already. I see a lot of new people on here. You dont have to believe me but that's really all I want. Subs and stuff don't matter when I can help people get better and actually enjoy the game. 
---
how is that arguable?
---
thank you
---
Only useful for mori dailies tbh, or like, if you were running only endgame perks but even then its not that good
---
Well you can't argue against it. My point is he is weak.
---
Nothing would except something overly specific. Like "Insta-down" or something similar. Anything else would still leave room for misinterpretation.
---
Because the Legion can use its power for mobility and quickly catch up to a survivor or even block a route denying a pallet or a loop. And depending on the playstyle of the Legion he could patrol hooks and going in for a save while being wounded would result in a down from a regular M1 tap. And ofcourse casual players dont really grasp how much he slows down the game with his deep wounds potentially combined with sloppy butcher and treat him like any other killer.
---
Thank you for your answer!
---
English is mostly based on German. If you know one it's fairly easy to learn the other.
---
I mean nothings really toxic in this game inherently. You as a killer make the rules , not the other way around , always remember that. But to answer your question in short yes , either embrace the moon-walk/frank strategy or don't play legion. He really is poorly design'd but that horse has long since been beaten 10 feet under , have fun and stay safe in the fog friend.
---
Yeah, hit them and a "kill" button will appear on him. Not really good when your obsession knows you have it since gen 1 and its gonna avoid you at all costs
---
Italian is a Romanic language, English is Germanic
---
Its actually the [third time!](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shrines_of_Secrets_Archive#Past_Shrines_of_Secrets)
---
So no one plays the *new* Killer the most optimal way?
---
You don't do tier lists around bad players lmao. That's like saying Nurse on PC and Console is D tier because bad Nurses are really bad. You do tier lists to a Killer played in their best way.
---
Yah he is loopable (although he does get an extended lunge which an help you get hits at loops you wouldn’t normally get, and having your EW3 active on its own greatly reduces the value anyone can get out of any loop just bc no one is gonna risk that extra loop when misjudgement means certain death) but imo his strengths greatly outweigh the fact that he can be looped. SB is still a big counter to his stealth, but just the fact that he has built in stealth nets him quick hits on unsuspecting prey and allows him to get close to big groups of people for his EW3 sweep where all of a sudden 3 people are downed and it’s gg. His ability to completely and utterly flip the course of a match on its head in a split second is honestly very powerful, and it’s not something you see from any other killer to that same degree, only NOED grants that same power.
---
downvote, brother Dwight. They shall not besmirch us.
---
&gt;It just said "suffer from Exposed" or whatever, immediately figured it had to be some kind vulnerability thing, because that's the most common usage of the word. 
---
You’re just objectively wrong. “Vulnerability” is not the most common usage of the word.
---
When a celebrity is “exposed”, it has nothing to do with them being vulnerable. It’s that their behavior has been **revealed** to everyone. Someone can “expose” themselves to another meaning **to reveal** intimate body parts. 
---
You can argue that people should have done the tutorial. But you can’t argue that it was not misleading to some people, myself included. 
---
I disagree that it needs to be changed to a different word because it does give you an “oh shit” panic moment. 
---
You'll find a lot of survivors will lash out anything with no logic to justify a bad game especially if they lose.
---
Clearly OP doesn't either. This is the result of an unloaded/missing texture, not JPEG artifacting 
---
I mean, what map can even arguably be better for killers than The Game?
---
Oh hey fellow masshole 
---
Yikes
---
Weakened, brittle, vulnerable, or fragile come to mind. Those have far closer meanings to going down instantly than exposed would.
---
10/10 placement from devs.
---
I hope they fix this, I have the same problem. Ruin is awful.
---
Super exciting when the killer bypasses gameplay balancing and my team sits in a corner scared the entire time.
---
But this would be going on constantly, a million times more than it happens now. If a survivor has to start gens and all the killer has to do is gen patrol, it’s going to be a very long ordeal. One that you  can’t prove as holding hostage cause the survivor can claim they were sneaking to gens and you kept coming to check on them. BHVR ain’t dealing with that shit. The only hostage stuff they care about is something like body blocking, that can be proven in a relatively short video. 
---
Oooh my bad. Well you never know, some disagree. Just thought putting arguably sounded better. I'm not an expert :P
---
Next week on shrine of secrets: Overcharge and Sprint Burst
---
I just chainsaw whipped a Laurie through a couch on Ormond. Hell yeah
---
Stealth builds dont work. The only stealth perk thats good is Iron Will and sometimes Quick and Quiet
---
I speculate that the 40% cut Valve would take from all of their sales was too high for them.
---
You could say the bikini cost Kate an arm and a leg
---
Can't complain about moris while saying gen rushing is okay
---
After all "ItS tHe ObJeCtIvE"
---
&gt;If a healthy survivor steps on a trap, they become injured. In an injured survivor steps on a trap, they become dying.
---
Sure, or Injured Survivors have a lower % chance to free themselves.
---
&gt;Also, let Trapper put traps underneath hooks.
---
Sure, as long as Survivors are buffed to be 100% completely immune to traps during the unhooking animation and for 2 seconds afterwards.
---
Literally all legions tho
---
Interesting. can you give an example? I had been interested in that game until I noticed that the survivors can get guns.
---
It’s just as bad as a hatch standoff. So it looks like there’s no winning in this situation. 
---
The Great Skillcheck Zone isn't easier to hit, it's the same size and as hard to hit as normal Great Skillchecks. However, I get your point that survivors may focus more on the great ones but that's just a placebo effect, they are not really easier to hit.
---
However the increased skillcheck chance can actually let survivors complete a generator quicker because of the small repair bonus Great Skillchecks give.
---
Except they're literally not in any of my examples? 
---
"We're *vulnerable* out in the open, we need to get to cover."  "This side here is *vulnerable*, it should be our target."  "I don't like this, I feel *vulnerable* without my sidearm."
---
Your response indicates that your issue of recognizing meaning and context extends beyond DBD. It's no wonder you don't think it's often used that way when you can't recognize when it is.
---
BL makes some maps have near infinites if you use it well. That alone is powerful enough to use it.
---
IT'S PROBABLY NOT QUITE AS BAD HERE ON PC HONESTLY BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF SWF SHIT TALKERS LIKE THAT
---
Faints during shift would still make the killer think regardless if land another one .You still had to account for the Jason’s different shift speeds  which added another factor to the gap . Keeping track of damage done to you before limp, stamina management and weapon durability are crucial to survival .Different swing speeds and types  , unlocking and locking  mixed with feints is what separated good counselors form great . DBD survivor advanced tactics are few and far between due to the limited mechanics of the game . I have fun on DBD but it is a MUCH simpler game regardless if someone likes it better or not .
---
Sounds like you only played at release . They fixed his immunity block  and swing cancelling is still in the game .  His grab got nerfed hard as did the durability of weapons . The tripping is stupid though and the perk system was trash .
---
Thats actually a good idea and makes sence too, well done
---
Language is fucked only if majority speak like that. Gladly that isn't the case. 
---
You can get teachables for every survivor. It's the orange perk at level 30, 35 and 40, and then ty can unlock that perk for other survivors. Every survivor is the same besides cosmetics (and besides the fact that Tapp and Claudette are harder to see...) once you get their teachables.
---

Hey, could you gift me... uhhh... Myers?

If Survivors are going to group up in basement against Huntress they deserve it lmao.

This is a masterpiece but ok

I thought they all had different teachable?

Don't feel bad, the first time i went against Myers I would run the entire time screaming lol

Had a game this afternoon where only 1 gen got done by the time 3 had dies, and instead of trying to get a second gen in order to spawn the hatch the last Survivor just locker hopped in the basement. After 5 minutes I assumed as much, so I checked and caught her.
---
now i want art of joker running over to a killer that has a mask to "reveal it's true form", only to get immediately hooked
---
Still tho. Infinite class photo would be pretty freaking thicc, even if all we can do is dream.
---
If you hit anyone injured it’s tunneling... people are dumb. Ignore them.
---
Wait are you the survivor? You are dedicated lol
---
I Just imagine a compilation of jumpscares If this was an actual thing, i would shit myself getting scared
---
Nice, but voice comms would still make it  easier for Survivors, even if the game could some how override voice comms/third party software ( people  would not play it).
---
Man it would make for such a great horror game where you had  no music, no heart beats/stain, no hud, just breathing/movement  sounds from killer/survivor , environment sounds and all of this was based on the range you are from point of  origin ( which would carry farther depending  on environment).
---
If they could not disable  comms then make proximity  chat that way  if could  be an even field vs SWF.
---
https://steamcommunity.com/id/GlitchesEverywhere
---
It would be like you’re running and you find a house, it has the key to the hatch but now you gotta find the hatch and then you hear the loudest scream ever because your friend just got hooked right next to you and the killer’s right there.

I got temporary banned on Xbox for swearing at an asshole (who swore at me first.) Ever since, i’ve been PC. And i dont regret it😌
---
You lose extra progress when you fail a skillcheck. Therefore, this perk is active the moment a skillcheck is hit
---
And maybe anthem as well, although it won't be at launch and it might be only cross-saves and not actual gameplay (progression might be transferred). If they manage to do it for that game i will definitely try and speak with dbd devs about it
---
Unbreakable allows one to revive themselves...hence the word "pairing". I think tenacity and unbreakable go together well because you get back on your feet more quickly.
---
Very awesome! Great work!

I love having Happy clowns colored perks. The items and addons look so nice as well. 
---
So you are saying for a console killer it's perfectly fine going against a pc 4 man swf? With all the frame drops at every bloodlust stack and what not? Thansk but no
---
Just grind to a million bloodpoints and don't worry about it.
---
You mean almost every other survivor after rank reset 🤕
---
Yep basically! They're decorative studs and jewelry wire
---
I stopped playing this game around december because of this. They promised months ago a december optimization patch that never came and honestly i'm fed up with fake promises. I'm just salty I threw money for the game and for some dlcs. Devs should be ashamed of making console players pay 30 dollars for such an undevelopped and unoptimized game, i think it's ridiculous.
---
Yeah Billy gets looped constantly. Spirit doesn't
---
Maybe just make It more difficult to survivors, my other idea that would combine with this. If you cant look at the killer, cuz It would screw your vision, even If you try to speak with your friends It would be pretty hard escape. Even in the normal game mode there are a Lot of swf that end up with everyone dying.
---
Yeah i would shit myself
---
Are you a good huntress?
---
Its not only useful for situations like this its also good in general to know the whereabouts of the survivors, for example which generator they're at so you dont waste time scouting an empty area. 
---
This is quit creative 
---
Not on my Christian DBD server you won't be
---
No idea sadly it’s pretty annoying lol
---
Yes, but once you unlock them with that character you never have to pick them up again. 
---
I mean if you're playing on a mac that isn't even playing on a pc. It's like you're playing on a pc emulator which is obviously not enough. 
---
So predictable.

Guess the next meme I make will consist of only the good King’s English... or ‘Queen’s’ I suppose it would be.
---
Eh, I do not think it makes that much of a difference in the end. It could be made to not appear until after a *failed* skillcheck, but meh. 
---
So I have to grind to level 30-40 to unlock? 
---
I have great news! They announced an optimization patch coming for december 2018!!!! 
---
Oh wait..
---
I think its hilarious it has caught me off guard a few times
---
Guys please stop downvoting it was a joke, I’m losing karma pls guys
---
My personal fav i ever got was on my like 2nd game of lf i got a 4k by baiting the last guy into saving his buddy (i literally kept my tr just behind him and the moment he started unhooked i reved up my saw and killed him) and he responded with "you are literally the most braindead LF ive ever seen"
---
I don’t understand how it’s even fun for survivors to just waste time like that. Might as well die trying to do a gen and then move onto the next game. Some People take each game so seriously
---
Another arguable game mode I had in mind was 2 killer, 8 survivor, 10 gens must be done, more than two exit gates, astronomically bigger map, just a way to spice it up &gt;:) tell me your thoughts on this.
---
It’d be great if everyone who bought LF just for bbq could refund the big camping guy and just keep the perk

Here is a post where a dev (Dave Richard) says in mid 2016 that DBD has been going under balance changes for 2.5 years. Which would date it to around early 2014.  
---
But with all that aside, I agree it's kind of crazy that such similar style games were all released in such a tight timeframe. 
---
I don’t use it for this reason only. It requires you to get at least three hooks before it actually becomes actually effective but since survivors can see if as soon as they start a gen it always becomes useless

Where is the picture of her unmasked from? Are there pictures of all the members unmasked?
---
Freddy's perks aren't very good at all, and he's extremely easily abusable, but he has certain strengths no other killer has.
---
There was a thread here awhile ago showing all of them unmasked, I think it was posted right before the dlc was released
---
Wat? For real? Lol that /s is more powerful than i tought 
---
Not all survivors who work together well are SWF.
---
Not even gonna lie here... played both games plenty and I’d say rocket league is MUCH worse. It’s just so hard to find good people on there.
---
Most recent ptb ran really smooth for me. Hopefully the mid chapter patch will help out. 
---
Like, Kill with your Friend? Now THIS is epic. Seriously its actually a great Idea too but i think 8 survivors are a little too much, maybe 6.
---
That one isn't as reliable as putting it at the top of those stairs right next to the hole, nearly impossible to see and no survivor typically takes that route when wandering. At this point I have started seeing them finding the one at the bottom of the vault.
---
Hey, that's my catchphrase! -Freddy

I'm currently working on the self care perk I feel as if that's a main one to have really. Thanks for the recommendations

If there’s no ruin and there is a hex totem, is it reasonable to just leave it? 
---
Blue hair feng min and pink hair nea
---
Of course it makes a difference, the totem gets broken before the damn thing does any good
---
Easy fix. Make it a 5 minute timer and you need to heal one health state or get damaged for a health state, or repair for a total of 50%.
---
There is zero excuse for a game to go on for as long as they can. If the survivor doesn't give up on hide n seek, the killer either needs to get lucky and find them or they need to disconnect which punishes them and not the survivor who is breaking the rules. Killers should not be forced to bring in a perk to fix a problem with the game. "Oh, your stuck in a game with a survivor who is hiding and refuses to do a generator and you don't have whispers? You deserve to be the victim of the survivor breaking the rules all because you didn't want to bring in a perk that takes up one of your limited perk slots. Oh, we could easily remove a way that allows someone to break our rules? Too bad, we don't feel like doing that. It seems like too much effort to do right."
---
It just seems lazy not to fix an issue in a game just because there is a way to fix the problem in the form of a perk when you have a limited amount of slots for perks. And you can either take in the perk that fixes a problem that you may have little to no use for or a perk that helps you avoid that problem. But if you take in the perk to help avoid the problem but still end up with the problem, you're screwed just because the developers are lazy.
---
Imagine a gun in call of duty that instantly kills every enemy and it has one shot every minute. Sure you can take in the perk that prevents that single gun from killing you but it is taking up a perk slot when there is no guarantee that it will be useful. Pretty much every one will agree that just having that one perk does not justify in that gun existing the way it does. Just like how whispers does not justify a survivor being allowed to hold a game hostage for 20 minutes.
---
Sometimes you just need to use your brain to fix a problem. Tapping a gen does not mean you're working towards escaping. Doing 50% in total for generators generally means you're making an effort. If you get hit or heal, you're probably trying to escape. But if you're crouching around for 5 minutes not actively working to escape, you deserve to lose.
---
What the fuck lol
---
camp map is coming back in an update for last year
---
I disagree with you.  I have a lot of fun playing both as freddy, and against him.  It just sounds like you've got too much salt to see clearly.
---
As a survivor I find it fun staying within his terror radius as he looks all over the place for me, and gives up.  Then it's gen, friend, or self heal for the easy wake up.
---
When you play as him you get a lot of versatility.  He's the best slugging strategy killer in the game.  He's also the best stalling killer in the game.  
---
And you couldn't be more wrong.  Survivors love playing against freddy.  It's almost always a guaranteed teabag party, and everyone's invited.  If you can't have fun playing against freddy you've got problems.  If you don't like playing as freddy, because you don't think he's fun then don't play as freddy.  
---
I've probably played freddy more than anyone here.  He is well balanced.  The two things I mentioned are brutal.  Getting  7 free seconds on a generator, and totems, and self care wakeups are the two main reasons why freddy is laughed at. 
---
I want to balance him.  Hopefully the devs are smart enough to ignore the rework BS, and want to balance him to.
---
I agree that it is a perk issue. Not saying that perks will grantee you a 4K every time but it could help with the looping.  Spirit fury, bamboozle,  enduring. For  me I use clown with exhaustion and  blindness bottles.
---
Dude I feel you, rank reset is a furious week of playing
---
yeah I always just say whatever and make a new account if my karma gets too low, but I've managed to shitpost this one into high karma on the subreddits I actually use so I've kept with it for awhile
---
I was in a game where Legion just slapped each survivor once and then ran to the next one. At one point everyone had Deep Wound and it made me think of this video.
---
this literally just happened to me
---
well, guess i have to farm those perks then 
---
“Too much salt to see clearly” yah man that’s obviously it, I’ve played every killer probably a good 10 hours at least, and Freddy is easily the worst designed. 
---
tfw pirated photoshop
---
You mean like this?  XD
---
[https://youtu.be/NjqPtNi8IV8?t=109](https://youtu.be/NjqPtNi8IV8?t=109)
---
Sometimes it's just about an inch or two to completion so why not take a bit of risk? XD
---
Definitely look into some perk builds the buff coming to survalince is gonna be huge and probably make it an A tier perk ! 
---
Did you have problems before?
---
If you make a build around them, I agree. And that's part of why I think Freddy doesn't need a complete rework like some people do. He has the makings of a good killer there, the devs just need to not make him abusable and he'd be fine.
---
I wonder if you're SWF and know it's haunted grounds and time to cleanse it at the same time together, do both of you get it? Or just one?
---
Never got to try cos I have no friends. PepeHands
---
That overstatement gets tired.  Is it choppy?  Yes.  Unplayable?   Not even remotely close. 
---
like youve NEVER been upset at some aspect of a multiplayer game, fuck outta here with your false perspective
---
with the insane guaranteed amount of BP? sure as hell you can. 
---
Hah, I was thinking the Christmas event and trying to find stuff around it. Thanks!
---
Get good. 
---
That carpet is really really dirty.....
---
No.. Just feet will do.
---
sometimes there are legitimate reasons not to leave, you don't know whether or not other survs are safe or if you'll need to help them. 
---
VR?
---
name one. i have never once in 200 hours of play, time in PTR, and the beta, i have NEVER. ONCE. seen a survivor, even playing as a survivor, hang by the door and hesitantly venture back to help anyone. Its always to taunt, its always to teabag, its always just to fuck with the killer.
---
Rank 1 means literally nothing so yes. 
---
Maybe try playing survivor for a while, if you understand how survivors operate you tend to make better decisions as a killer
---
Agreed. I main Kate and bought it immediately on release.
---
I literally do that every game where i dont know the location of all other survs
---
If you were to pick one killer to focus on out of the three, which would you pick and why?  Im leaning towards billy tbh
---
You played bad, kills aren't the only thing that matter, get good. 
---
But it doesn't do anything til you have at least one token, people have been arguing that it shouldn't show til it becomes effective.
---
Just one, because one totem gets immediately deactivated and turns into a regular dull totem once Haunted is triggered.
---
Freddy is the best slugger.
---
I understand, however I feel as though legion when utilizing butcher, thana, nurses and the green knife is easily A tier.
---
I would even suggest when mastered him being S tier 
---
You Freddy lovers have no idea how hard it is at mid-low ranks to get 4ked by him every game.  So fuck you.
---
Would have made a great “To Be Continued” meme.
---
Well played, sir!

---
Your dumb because you outsmarted them?
---
How low of an IQ do they need to have that type of logic?
---
It is different in the fact that the other hexes don't display until their status takes effect. Lullaby shows up immediately before you can get a token giving survivors a heads up to cleanse before it can take any kind of effect
---
Thank you, I was about to say that
---
I feel like the person that dcs should lose the add-ons not everybody in the game
---
That's a mighty leap of logic there.
---
My first thought, Damn she fine... Wait, that looks like that kate cosplayer.... \*checks\* YAAAAAAAAAS! You're a champion!
---
Just because you haven't experienced something doesn't mean others won't go rescue off the hook after the gate is open. There's more points in getting a safe unhook than there are by getting hit. The gate is also a safe area once it's open. People wait to see if noed is active and if it is they leave. If it isnt they go for the rescue or farm. Either way those are legitimate reasons for staying. 
---
You have a terrible attitude over small irrelevant shit in the game.
---
Who's "they"?
---
Lol what
---
Y'know, I was always a little bugged by that effect with Ruin 1 or 2. Devs are devs though and I have learned to expect only a certain amount of them. I definitely still respect them, but they have their quirks. 
---
Also, Sole Survivor is still an option for Obsession perks that sees usage, btw. Works well in the event that the killer uses Nurse's Calling, and in some cases, BBQ. Even Bitter Murmur
---
That save was sexy
---
Lol yep that's me! Thought I'd cosplay the other side this time 
---
You can do a SWF build where everyone runs No Mither, Unbreakable/Tenacity/Saboteur, BreakDown, and Empathy.
---
Keep saboing the hooks on a side of the map and the Killer won't be able to hook you without certain perks.
---
Braces? You're brave
---
What you had to do? I play on ps4 and we don't have that one.
---
 
---
I can relate. Most of the time I do 2-3 gens while the others have fun unhooking or hiding in corners, crouching around the map with no other goal than wait for others to do gens. The best trick I found is to DC a few times and deranks. Then you don’t always get toxic games and sometimes, you might get in the same lobby of another rank 15 who just wants to play the game as it was designed. 
---
It may not be clean, but I also want to have fun playing. If it feels like a job, there’s something wrong. 
---
I play PS4. If you actually read what I put, then you'd know that. 
---
But what about getting messages from pissed off survivors. They call me shit because they died first. But the toxic dicks here did nothing but say "LMAO" and call me shit
---
I'm definitely getting that head piece

Its not a leap of logic. If people misuse words enough, i.e. change its meaning, then that's exactly what will happen. Its actually what is happening when people are resorting to calling someone a nazi for wanting to have border control.

Lemme tell ya, today I played a game at rank 7 as Legion against all neas and Megs, on the game map, I was doing alright no kills yet but a lot of hooks, so none of them were healing and I thought it was odd but I didn't think too much of it then when the last gen gets popped boom they all had adrenaline and all healed back to normal, I did so fucking fast, idk if it was cause of legion or just the map that I was doing bad but idk. Straight toxic.
---
Ctrl is still the same as crouching. He's literally using ctrl as a word for crouching. /facepalm
---
This is nothing about you or the topic, but I don't have time for this. Don't expect a reply. 
---
Down vote if you want.
---
I do the same thing
---
then it's working
---
You're part of the problem aren't you
---
That bit towards the end with bleeding David trying to reach out to Jake looks like Titanic-level romantic drama. 
---
There is a huge point grind in this game, and it takes 5 seconds for the killer to run into the gate and swing. It is a pretty small cost for small gain. It is less a case of "why do it?" and more a case of "why not?" when it gets a bit of extra points for you when this game has such a huge grind.
---
I never said it wasn't. 
---
&gt;I play PS4. If you actually read what I put, then you'd know that. 
---
Are you sure about that? The platform makes no difference to the action within the game.
---
Called me pathetic because I have the better opinion man, I’m just done with you, your either a troll or just a very sad person, so my final answer is, you’re a dumbass lollll
---
If i could I would give them to myself.
---
No /s here
---
You sound pretty racist to me.
---
Everytime I go prestige my perks just go haywire and I get useless perks on bloodweb.
---
"Look at so these trees!!" Ahahaha omg this guy is great
---
The underwater map
---
You have to complete the last generator when all other survivors are dead then escape through an exit gate
---
That had to be calculated 
---
hey, op, it's all good.
---
right now you're actually in the school of Life for killers. green and purple ranks are filled with swfs and it's very annoying. but it makes you a better killer if you don't give up. just play, play, play. get better perks. 
---
like, I'm a rank 1 killer but last season I waited for a week after reset to see what it's like on lower ranks again. and I was on green ones and would always get an swf with 1-2 red ranks. same on purple but less yellow and brown ones, just green, purple and red. and gotta say, I don't envy less skilled killers, fam. if I didn't have the experience I have as rank 1 killer, I'd have a reaaaaally hard time with those. maybe it's just me or maybe it's just last season, but I had only swfs of 3-4 men for several days straight. I mean I crashed most of them but I wouldn't if I wasn't a red rank killer. 
---
If you call those pathetic responses an argument.  You're the troll.  And not a very good one. good by moron.
---
You know what steam has that literally no other launcher has? Gift cards. it's literally the only way I can get games on steam. I buy these gift cards for 20/50/100 dollars, input the code from the card onto my account and now my wallet has a ton of funds for me to spend on steam. I have yet to hear of another launcher with such a feature. And for someone who dosen't have a credit card (and will never get one) that's a fucking godsend.
---
Man you are either the saltiest, dumbest mother fucker, or a no life troll, honestly just stop messaging me, it’s sad. 
---
Yeah, which is why I prioritize doing the gen in there. Dead end next to basement. Its gotta be knocked out 
---
How it would look like?
---
I might have to go back and do that. 
---
Another Lerys map or a city block type map.

Cool.

Really? Are you sure graphics were what you were talking about?

&gt;7 games in a row where it's been full of fucking toxic 4 person swf who did nothing but T-BAG 99% of the game.
---
Looks a lot like you weren't to me and everyone reading. Especially since you headed the post as "fuck everyone" 
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee
---
Some sort of castle with a hedge maze.
---
The licensing issue was an excuse for the developer to abandon the game as Victor Miller stated that the game could continue regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit and Horror Inc.'s attorneys were on record stating the same prior to the ruling. 
---
F13 game died due to many things, the horrendous launch due to the overwhelming amount of PS4 players, rage quitting players, bugs and exploits that took for ever to fix and still aren't fixed and the developer flat out lied about content and DLC. 
---
*Cough* go down a bit. I have a bit on graphics. 
---
It’s a line from Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. The main character killed someone and is implied to be a teenager or young adult, but he’s at least a little remorseful and most members of the Legion aren’t. It’s not a perfect fit but I think it’s funny.
---
You should delete this you just look like a moron. I wait by the gate all the time to see if anyone needs saving or help escaping. If you’ve never seen this you must be a rank 20 player who is legit that bad. 
---
This is one of those instances where they don't deserve to know.
---
Damm it would be awesome.
---
Are you on mobile? Tap them and it’ll uncover the words, they’re for potential spoilers.
---
I just want a haunted mansion ffs 
---
Forcing vsync off gave me a better framerate because last patch decided to force me at 30fps for some reason, but it didn't really help my stuttering; your mileage may vary.
---
I am, and I've only had the app two weeks or so. That worked though, so now I know! Thank you so much, that makes so many posts make sense!
---
yea they kinda covered the smile with the blood
---
The one that I imagine is similar to the game layout.
---
thanks, now i need it to happen.
---
I do just fine with rank 1 myers, but I can't really speak for you, but thanks for asking.
---
That’s what I thought you would say ;)
---
My favorites are final boss, pallet eater, and flashlight hunter.
---
As of 2016 the average age of a console gamer is 35 years old. You may want to re-evaluate your opinion it just doesn't follow the facts friend.  
---
Searching within the subreddit
---
Playing against the wraith will never be the same again.. BING BING BING lmao
---
Yeah, I love it. I've had several games where I've glanced down at my perks and I'm like "wait, when did I lose a token? Shit, what do they have?" And then I'm extra vigilant and notice it go the next time and it's like "Ooooh, Bitter Murmur." or "So they do have BBQ, it must just be a lower rank."
---
Plus, I've had it go off while I've been healing and I've just casually finished or, if there wasn't time for that, carefully moved to safety. Rather thab suddenly getting caught out by surprise by a small TR Killer running Nurse's.
---
Had a game similar to this earlier as spirit. Except everyone was dressed the same as david, so unless i checked the HUD i didnt know who was who, they were stupidly altruistic and would even crouch behind me as i hooked someone (playing as spirit trained my ears to be rather sharp at detecting grass movement/ breathing) so of course i would patrol the area after a hook, and the dingelheads would unhook when im looking straight at them, so of course i down the injured one because thats common sense. 
---
Idk what happened but post game of them was whining about tunneling and im like "dont unhook when im right there then" 
---
What am i supposed to do, gently give the survivor a free pass because he was unhooked right in front of me, heal the injured survivor myself and remove one of his hook stages? 
---
Gave the last david/my obsession the hatch so he was the only one really that didnt whine that i ate them alive 
---
Doing a gen in a library and opening a secret door.
---
Like a haunted armor? Maybe if a survivor is hit they could get cursed and have to do something to break the curse
---
Tenacity is back again
---
Mr. X was a geek, Nemesis was a UNIT.  He came for that ass and back in the PS1 days when you thought a door-opening-loading-screen could protect you from any enemy, seeing that big biological machine burst on through and chase after you made you feel helpless.  
---
And Nemesis came with a rocket launcher, because why the fuck not?  So now you're facing an enemy that's super resilient, fast, can instant-critical you with one of his attacks, follow you into nearly every room and knows how to use a rocket launcher of all things.  
---
Dorks will say "Pyramid Head is scarier!" but Nemesis would chokeslam that goofy Toblerone looking bitch into obscurity.  
---
With that said, Mr. X would be a day one buy.  
---
I’m all for this. Secret passages, maybe 3 floors and add a cellar as well! Could be awesome.
---
You shoulda went for the other first
---
I really want a true carnival or circus map. Was disappointed it didn’t come with the release of the Clown because done right it can be an incredibly creepy and awesome map.
---
Those survivors probably de ranked just so they can get Killers that aren't as experienced. 
---
It's nothing against your render, I just don't like the costume she has in general.  It's exposing too much of her face and making her look all beautiful.  I like my Nurse as a faceless ghoul. 
---
We still can dream right?
---
I just don't get why some survivors think that they're the only ones who should actually tryhard and their objective. They do whatever they can to get out. But if the killer tried hard to win they were being toxic. It sucks.
---
Why?
---
I play on PlayStation and nurse is actually the easiest chase of my life (and I’m usually really really bad at chases).
---
However good nurses do exist, they’re just scarce and are usually rank 1 and 2.
---
Holy shit that's awesome, GJ!
---
You head the post as "fuck everyone" and then reeee on about people crouching at a gate. The graphics aren't as bad as your hyperbolic post suggests. Stop with the reeee
---
If I'm not death hook, or even if I am but I did well in points, I'll stay behind at the gate to see if I can do anything to make a save if I know someone's being chased. And as I nearly always run Empathy I can usually tell if there's a chase going on somewhere and if I might be of use.
---
You're welcome, it gave me a good laugh and I shared it to some friends as well &lt;3 I hope things start looking up for you.
---
I have noticed lately myers stalking me through walls and other objects. Is he bugged?
---
It's a Nea-main, seconds after touching the ground, from a two foot drop.
---
Legion and Freddy, I just find their mechanics annoying.
---
Huntress hit boxes make me wanna stay on the hook
---
The pig makes me angry cuz they never like Megs and guess who my survivor main is :( 
---
What hatch? As we all know, hatches are hard to see. That's why they make noise to help find them. 
---
To be fair.... that is something she would probably set up in the movies so good job still!
---
He’s next on the list, boyo
---
Legion is really just an annoying killer. He/ she is just built for tunneling but their ability is useless in endgame which is the only advantage for survivors, if they even make it that far.
---
I use No Mither with Resilience and it goes one of three ways: The killer barely goes after me and I end up completing 2-3 gens, a killer I hate goes after me and I just die, or a killer I don't have trouble looping goes after me and I run a decent loop. When I have two health states I can loop the killer for quite a while if it goes well, but when I run No Mither the loop is over not before too long.
---
As a nea main I approve. 
---
This is amazing 
---
When the killer is chasing you on Lery's and you brought balanced landing.
---
Just play nurse all the time and the problem is solved. Now it is about how good you are, vs how good they are at mindgames and not, i got to a pallet GG EZ.
---
Legion:removes any fun from being chased and immediately takes any skill from said chase.
---
Huntress:muh hitboxes
---
Myers: cause he is the only one that legit is able to scare me when I am playing.  Eeeheee shimone
---
Spirit: vaulting and blinks
---
Freddy: he’s just himself
---
I don't get why almost all pigs tunnels the person with the trap.
---
One thing I can never understand is how people main only one killer. Doesn't it get boring? There are so many awesome killers out there but you still stick to just one. There is nothing wrong in it but it just baffles me.
---
&gt;You don't know where he places them and then you step into them
---
I mean... that's kinda the point of them. And Trapper isn't any faster than the base killer speed. In fact, his speed and other attributes are what other killers' attributes are based around. 
---
You've only been playing this game for a month, you still have a lot to learn. Eventually you'll see how weak killers can be.
---
I am now in need of the beach Jeff skin
---
All killers and survivors are overpowered if you're good at playing the game 
---
Its Its funny tho 
---
To be fair, I still feel that most killers still need buffs. Simply because it's a 4v1, and we killers are literal monsters and/or serial killers. They kill, John. It's what they do. 
---
Similar to the castle from resident evil 4?
---
I just don't really get the complaint of people about survivors sitting by the gate. It isn't like the killer can't just chase them out the moment they know they are doing it. I know I do it because I prefer to stay and make sure that there isn't a survivor being left behind, but even that aside, if you care about points, it is beneficial for both sides to let yourself get smacked out the gate instead of walking.
---
i know i shouldn't let these sorts of things get to me  
---
but they get to me and it makes me want to just stop playing this entirely, yes im a sensitive person but i can't help it, i just want to have fun, i have no control over my internet..
---
I used Sprint Burst while I was waiting for Lithe to show up on the blood web. I ended up keep Sprint Burst because the utility of being able to dash while not in a chase is very useful. With Spine Chill, Lightweight, Alert, and Sprint Burst, I could often sprint away from a gen to a safe vantage, not be tracked, then instantly know whether it would be safe to return.
---
It was doing really well over the last month but suddenly its taking ages again to load a game. Super annoying
---
About to get downvoted to oblivion, but why the fuck does susie looks like a dude in that picture (not the cosplay). The cosplay was great tho!
---
The reason why I believe it'll be a nerf it's because the main objective, and where you'll know you'll find someone, are generators. The other stuff is situational and you just hope to be lucky someone was near you with Leader.
---
It's the last achievement I have for survivor (along with taking one for the team). :/
---
Did you use the perk Left behind to repair the last gen faster?
---
It really just comes down to convenience. At the end of the day, it is really nice to have everything on one platform instead of trying to be on so many different platforms at once. If Valve wasn't up it is own ass about it and milking its monopoly, I would absolutely support an 'everything ends up on steam' movement.
---
If the toxicity is too bad to deal with (which I completely understand) maybe you could just say gg (or don't say anything) then immediately disconnect so you don't have to see what they have to say
---
Legion, because they're unfun to play even AS a killer, not just against.
---
PC
---
wish it didn't have to come to that..but alright
---
Yes, it is ironic, but not for the reasons you’re thinking.
---
Hello there
---
Y’all have to relax it’s a meme
---
Was just a suggestion, but one that makes sense. It sucks but you can't control what other people do on the internet. But you can choose to ignore it
---
Ty this helps a ton. Thinking ill stick with billy and keep practicing.
---
I think due to the nature of an assymetrical game like this, everyone has a side they prefer playing. A lot of people only see things from the side of their choice, so when something seems unfair or annoying, it feels more like the other side is op or gets better treatment. 
---
Holy shit that’s original, I’m done making fun of you kid so just shut the fuck up lol

Geezers that don't know how to use google?
---
What's the base upon which triple is built?
---
you say rank doesnt equate to skill but you're in the average middle rank?
---
but why
---
Spirit because she's annoying to go against, more annoying than legion
---
you seem like quite the toxic survivor main who wants to fuck over killers as much as possible, borrowed time was in a good state, no one had any problems with it
---
Small tip: don't run monitor with doctor. Use distressing. The doctor is the only character you want a larger heartbeat. 
---
Building Ruin is not viable anymore, at least in 10 - 1 ranks, better build Thanatophobia because it lasts until the end of the game, but Ruin lasts 3-5 min if you are lucky.
---
Would love to smack the shit out of someone with a sword
---
150k bloodpoints?
---
Can I take a "wild" guess and say that you were on Lery's?
---
Which should not display till someone misses said skill check. Ruin, devour, thrill, noed and third seal all don't say they are active till someone triggers it either by getting hit or touching a totem. Lullaby says it's active before people miss skill checks or someone gets hooked for a token therefore giving notice before it's actually been used. If it waited till someone missed a skill check or got a token it would be a more useful perk but being told about it as soon as you touch a gen invalidates the you don't know till it affects you or your team part of hexes.
---
Maybe seeing people as the enemy has a way to make them feel less human to most people? A lot of competitive games are known for their bad communities after all.
---
I’m not sure what’s the inside joke with that map, but no it was wreckers autohaven 
---
Actually, I use Doc the most. For my play style; I like his treatment mode because it allows me to find survivors just by walking around the map as they fall into madness and the add-ons give lots of fun opportunities. Madness has also helped me avoid a pallet in the face on several occasions.
---
The only reason I was wondering if it was that map was because of the hatch being across the map from the door. I've had a few matches where the hatch will spawn straight from the door on the other side of the map on Lery's multiple times
---
I haven't paid much attention to perk balance recently.
---
Which of the Exhaustion perks is most useful now? I see a lot of Balanced Landing but Sprint Burst still seems to be the top tier.
---
Same, but like I said 9/10 I don’t mind those hatch escapes, it what led up to it that made feel like I wasted my 20 minutes in that match. 
---
i wish people played pig more often
---
HA!
---
Ugly
---
Yeah I agree. I was on Yamoka Estate earlier as Hag and they weren't doing too bad of a job... I managed to kill three, and eventually found the fourth, in which I picked her up and was going to take her to find the hatch.
---
She began struggling, so I dropped her, shook my head as if to say "don't struggle", picked her back up and she began struggling again. She got off, ran off, therefore I just hooked her. I try to be a nice killer but the survivors don't make it easy.
---
He’s talking about Shelter woods, theirs no hills
---
I get what you mean, I’m not going to lie it does feel like survivors want to be as toxic as humanly possible lately. I tried to let someone go and they DS me into a pallet. Like??? 
---
&gt;State that language is changing. 
---
&gt;Someone agrees and gives an example how. 
---
&gt;People get upset over it, say its a leap of logic
---
&gt;Prove them wrong, get downvoted
---
You don't know what irony is.
---
Yeah, the Wraith stole her heart
---
It is, I don't know where you need to aim, I aim at the general body
---
Funny how you didnt have to change the second claudette's face
---
Do tell!
---
That is exactly what I said...I am fully aware that the killer is the host....
---
Well, you have encountered it because you are either lower level or you dont care to see it. Its the same mentality as those who think 60 FPS is all you need and you cant see anymore...then when they see 120-144-240 FPS and go back they see how trash 60FPS is. You just dont know what to look for. I have seen ever stop in the book pulled from 28 years of gaming. Throttling connection as a survivor can help...same as with killer. It is blatantly obvious. This is why some games have lag compensation techniques to counter ppl like this. *battlefield for one* Siege didnt have it for a long time and that is why there was so much adv for ppl with high ping...the fact you dont act like this is a problem tells me you havent played video games long or competitively. There is a reason Pro games are LAN.
---
"It is not possible for a survivor to lag switch as the current dead by daylight network topology uses something similar to a star connection."
---
Please take a networking class at your local community college if you actually believe that.
---
"If you were to cut off, throttle, or do other various things to one of the survivor nodes, it wouldn't affect ANY of the other survivors, or the killer as the killer is the host"
---
The survivor is directly degrading their connection to the host therefore the host sees the results of this...Are you joking right now? And I dont need to link you any videos as proof when they are out there and easy to find. Even TrU3Ta1ent has complained about this and it has shown on his stream. So the fact you say you cant find one video shows your bias.
---
"In my 700 hours of playing, I've never played against a cheating survivor, only killers."
---
You just told me right there you are a survivor main...you simply dont wish to accept facts or logic and rather cover them up. There is a reason they are switching to dedicated servers. Now try and prove me wrong with literary publications you wont find and then paypal me $100 as a sorry for being wrong.
---
Yeye, I wish he didnt have to try not to 2 pip.. i wanna see him 4k more.
---
Dang you’re right, I should’ve put in her SWF. 😤

That's clearly Wednesday Addams doing her best Lecter cosplay.

Sorry but i had to

You can get teachable perks from shrine too. If you don´t have the time level up a character you don´t like I recommend doing that. Borrowed time is a great choice (Bill).  Balanced landing is great from Nea but urban evasion is extremely overrated. Only good against the hag. People just urban evasion around while killer is chasing someone else. I hate that so much. Bond is a good perk from Dwight  (prove thyself will get buffed. leader is weird). Adrenaline is good from Meg. Iron will from Jake is pretty good.

Someone made this album, dwights a bit lanky but I enjoyed it. https://imgur.com/a/TMmES

Sorry for the self promo.. don’t hate me 😅

Your screen really should not be turning white anymore they changed that 
---
Default is 30%, games above $10 million in revenue 25%, games above $50 million 20%.
---
It wouldn't be the worst thing just to grab you at this point and let you wiggle free i mean she could destroy the pallet.
---
It annoys me that no one give a damn about good sportsmanship. 
---
Easy solution: stop playing Dbd on ps
---
I dont doubt you but Id love to see the original post
---
Got mine already. 
---
No, not really, in fact survivors used to be the power role before, now it's a lot more balanced. Since you're new and probably aren't good at looping you might think that there's nothing you can do. There's plenty of survivor guides on the Internet, maybe those will help you out. Oh and, don't worry about trapper too much (he's not that strong), but there's one killer that will give you troubles later on, The Nurse. If played correctly, she is the most overpowered killer in the whole game. 
---
I think if they added an RE killer I’d just want the original’s Tyrant, but any option would be cool.  Okay, maybe a tossup between Jack from RE7 and the Tyrant.  
---
&gt;Is it just me or are killers overpowered?
---
Just you. Killers are, arguably, underpowered against skilled survivors.
---
&gt;I've been playing this game for about a month now, and everytime I get found or start a chase I literally can't ever win. 
---
Well, thats kinda what should happen. 9/10 times, the killer starts chasing you, he is going to get you. What you should be aiming for is to make that as time consuming as possible. Knowing which way to run, hugging walls and taking sharp corners, using pallets and vaults will all help keep him off you. When it comes to traps, like beartraps or hag traps, you kind of have to predict where they might be. Check where he came from and run the other way, less chance he's set traps there. Try not to vault unless you have seen the other side. Little things like that help.
---
&gt;He is faster than other killers 
---
He's normal speed.
---
I think you need to find a way that suits you. It sounds like running isn't your strong suit, so maybe you need to lean on stealth a bit more. I don't know what perks you are running, but picking up SB or DH will help in the chase. It might even be worth your time grabbing Windows of Oppertunity so you know where to run.
---
That survivor must've been so fucking happy for like half of a fucking second.
---
Dat t3 myers tombstone counter though.
---
The devs changed the blind screen from pure white to a reddish effect a while ago. Not to mention that if you really hate being blinded, you can always equip Lightborn. Then you'll never be blinded again.
---
I wish I could do this in every game
---
In my region its a signficantly lower chance unless their own network connection is bad. As a host...same with any server in the real world. Those within my region who have a stable connection will be connection to a server that has the proper bandwidth to support the match. There is a reason 2 killers and 8 survivors doesnt exist...you need very good upload speed with low latency to be a good host. So acting like that is not a factor shows me you dont understand much on how it works.
---
That point? LOL, I never ignored that point. No shit latency is determined by distance. That is what I have been saying the entire time (talk about thick skulls)
---
I find it hilarious how you are trying to act like you know what you are talking about when you are far from understanding and need to take a course in networking.
---
It makes perfect sense because money is not everything to some people...are you fking serious right now? Lol. The mentality to win is enough for some people to do anything. There doesnt have to be money or anything else involved...simply the desire to win/best another human is enough to sacrifice. The fact you dont understand this is beyond comprehension.
---
In conclusion please dont reply I have already lost enough brain cells reading the trash you typed.
---
I second this.  I often wait near the exit for a bit to see if everyone else is safe, wait on the result of someone’s hook rescue attempt, etc.  Have never done it to taunt the killer and if I see that teammates are staying to taunt/farm will leave them immediately even if they’re in danger.
---
*"first time ?" meme*
---
If they can hit great skill checks every time its technically a buff.
---
I could make that when I get home from work, but I don't want people to think I'm karma farming or some nonsense. I mean, I rarely make actual posts as is, but that's tempting lol
---
Well, I guess it is time to level hillbilly. I really didn't got around his chainsaw so I kinda abandoned him.
---
There is a lot of toxicity in this game and, despite what some might like you to think, it is pretty much all survivors. Toxic survivors are every second game, the toxic killers I've seen I can count on one hand.
---
I don't know whether it's the fact that they are 13. Or whether they signed up for a different experience than they got. Or if they just think that being a massive dickhead is okay and that everyone should just 'deal' with their bullshit instead of them cutting it out. The problem is that nothing is done to stop them or discourage them. There are multiple game mechanics that could be implemented to stop toxic behaviour, as well as better feedback on players being banned for shit behaviour.
---
killer could not pickup me neither
---
Why would anyone want Tapp's weird ability to suddenly cause his neck to bleed?
---
I fell like Sprint burst is the best for all round use but the downside is once u run and sont want to use it then its gone. If u get good with the other one i.e balanced landing I feel like u can get a lot more out of it. I always run balanced and it comes in clutch so many times and since I have adrenaline I also get Sprint burst once a game too so I'm good. In the end it probably personal preference.
---
Perks do matter a lot of Doc.
---
Then why does killer have NOED in the game? Then why does killer hahe Lightborn in the game? Then why is killer able to look up in the sky to counter flashlight?
---
Pretty cool except you got one thing wrong. The entity takes people, not places. He just recreates those places. 
---
Which map is this?
---
That dress is like a curtain but at least the head looks good. Gonna Dave my coins for Feng, Huntress, and Spirit instead. 
---
It’s a really neat party trick
---
Pretty much anyone is more hidden than shirtless David.
---
Okay to make it clear, I could have been on huntress my main, with zero hatchets in this exact same scenario, I could have been T3 Michael in this scenario, wraith, clown, pig
---
The point was that after landing my hit on him, HE outpaced me for 2/3 of the map by combining DH + hit boost to get to a hatch that was only opened due to a key. 
---
A necessary sacrifice for perfection
---
Legion. No counterplay on survivor side, and no skill required on killer side. Just pure unfun.
---
I’m aware perks matter, but we aren’t talking about a game where they got 4 or 5 gens, escape/died and the last survivor got the hatch
---
Sometimes I do it to spite the killer regardless of how much BP/rank they get for unfinished gens or whatever. Sometimes spite is fun.
---
A lot of people are willing to sacrifice fun to in order to win, probably because they view winning as the ultimate fun. Happens in every game where there are teams pit against each other.
---
Ok can anyone tell me the shrine for this week? Its urgent. 
---
haha i thought it was so funny, when you jumped the window you scared me XD
---
I don't want indoor maps anymore, but I'd like a burning forest or something like that.
---
I wouldnt call it a moment of harmony. If I win as killer, people always leave immediately, it's only when I lose everybody writes gg. Gets me sort of annoyed. 
---
Distorsion+SC is also very powerful when agaisnt a killer with nurse calling, just SC for half a sec and run with no scratchmarks, lost more than 1 killer that way, saved myself a lot of time.
---
The key is that they're really awful at the game, which essentially means that it does mean they'll lose the game.
---
Or you know, just make the basement stairs wider...
---
But the killer killed 3/4, and these were randoms.
---
Oh okay. I wasn't sure if he took them or not, figured it would be an interesting twist if a village just went up and vanished out of nowhere. 
---
SC is pretty dogshit not gonna lie, it takes soo long to complete a heal with it. I think Adrenaline from Meg is way better for healing.
---
Racist? UK isn't a race, it's a big hot mixing pot of culture. Some of it is nice, some of it isn't.
---
And it's not racist to say I don't like ghetto talk. I don't find it attractive or nice to listen to. I don't like ghetto talk. Simple as that. If you envision me as a 60 year old white man, then let me just tell you I am 16 years old, with Eastern African/Arab ethnicity.
---
My parents raised me to speak English properly, and I always enjoyed the subject. I got a grade 9 in English GCSE - I didn't get that grade by using ghetto slang.
---
If you don't like me, then downvote my comment. That's about as much as you can to do to change me.
---
I kind of want an old village with cobblestone streets and tiny houses 
---
I figure that intentional DCs can be somewhat detected by checking whether the disconnect button was pressed. And as you mentioned, while bad internet can cause some accidental disconnects, it's generally a rare thing, so that should keep any queue cooldowns low whenever it does happen to you. The harshest punishments will thus mainly be given to the people who keep doing intentional disconnects. It might not be a perfect system, but it's a major improvement over the current state of not really having one.
---
Hopefully you didnt have noed.
---
&gt; testing out a new build that didn’t require camping
---
I'm just going to get this out of the way: If you think any build in this game "requires camping" (other than Insidious which is just a meme), your entire approach is wrong, and you will never be a good killer until you reassess your outlook on how this game is played. No, I don't care that you are rank 1, it practically takes going afk until 5 gens are done to *not* pip as a Killer; it's a meaningless metric.
---
With that said, you talk about pressuring the map.. then say there are 3 alive with 1 gen left, yet if there weren't pallets on the map anymore as you claim this shouldn't be the case, *especially with Dying Light active*. With Doctor there is no stealth, only chases, and with nothing to work with.. yeah 3 people shouldn't still be alive. I can only assume you drastically misplayed a lot of your chases if that was the state of the game at that point.
---
Further, you can grab people out of the hatch. Maybe the Feng gets away through the hatch during your swing recover, fine, but the second guy? You should've grabbed him. You say he jumped "during your shock", so if that means you were too stunned with disbelief to react, that's on you, and if he jumped in while you were using your actual power, why would you even swap back to Treatment mode in the first place (although Doc can grab in Treatment mode, anyway)?
---
After that, you had a hatch standoff for 5 minutes... and then let the survivor run away, and do a gen? Why did you not chase him away from the hatch when he left? Why would you willingly let him escape and go do whatever he wanted? Just because the hatch is open doesn't magically make the other, primary, means of escape disappear.
---
The Hatch may not be a great mechanic, but it doesn't sound like you were "outplaying them at almost every occasion". It sounds like you made a lot of critical errors, the game got out of hand, and you're blaming an item instead of thinking critically about what you could've done better.
---
I’m about to bust!
---
Holy duck that got me worse than most content on r/creepy 😂
---
All the grass there just needs to be multiple floors such as if the killer runs underneath the gen when you're working on the one in the wood cabin you can see grass next to you moving
---
Thanatophobia is a horrible perk, especially in high ranks. It doesn't slow down progress that much and the red bar is not gonna mind game a high rank survivor. Most importantly, it goes away when someone dies.
---
Hit them out. 
---
Pig i get scared when she attacks 😶😶😤
---
Why blindness? 
---
How do you even do them on console and get them to reddit though?
---
If it's above the basement/stairs, ANY. It's like the game doesn't recognize you're below the ground.  Take a look at Azarov's Resting Place when the basement spawns in that little hut on the edge of the map. There's quite a bit around there.
---
Uh, no? Leader just won't affect gen repairs
---
I mean it would have been nicer for you to kill the people unhooking but you do you
---
Still better than playing with 3 perks, because using Ruin is like playing with 3 perks
---
Lol isn't half as bad as DBD, not in the same ballpark.
---
I had no idea it was possible to depip as killer. Seriously even if you kill no one you should safety pip
---
Tell me about it mate. Can’t really bring myself to play this game anymore 
---
They are two pretty unsafe pallets. They are also seperate tiles. Double pallets are two loops in one tile
---
I think it's the fact that you don't have much control in a game. 
---
people can just bodyblock you, especially annoying it is with Billy or swfs that block the hook for a buddy to use ds. 
---
also they can sandbag when you kite the killer and you just die when they supposed to be doing gens. or drop a pallet on you when you're the one injured. like no matter how good you're in chase because others acted like idiots you couldn't do anything. or overall you keep killer busy and they just immerse cause hear terror radius instead of fixing gens. 
---
or as killer you play like a good guy and hook and go, hook and go. if you don't play dirty at some time of the match, you get shitted on by the game mechanics and survivors calling you baby killer just because you *chose* to have a match without Ruin, noed, tunneling and camping. and there's nothing you can do even if you were efficient and good in chase, the gens still will be done very fast. like the game forces you to tunnel at some point to put a pressure on. if you do tunnel because no other way to get kills, then you're a cunt and asshole in survivor's logic and you still get the t-bagging and insults in the post chat. 
---
no other game I ever played had so little control you can possess. it's frustrating cause in most cases it doesn't matter how good you are at kiting, juking, chase, putting pressure on, there are way too many unforseen circumstances. 
---
like rn I was playing Spirit for a daily. nothing op, just green add-ons, BBQ, Discordance, Pop Goes the Weasel, Bamboozle. very good team, not sure if swf. I was playing as fair as possible, not a single asshole move. I hooked a guy, last gen. went to look for someone else. then came back to the hook when he was saved like 30 seconds after cause didn't find anyone. saw a Meg with ds I only hooked once(others twice) and I went for her. injured and was chasing for a bit. the gen popped, she had Adrenaline while the unhooked guy was still injured. I made a decision to not tunnel and I paid for it a price of not getting any kills because of this one last spit apart from 2 Iron Wills and and 4 Dead Hards. that's frustrating, really. because I was about to down her when it popped but then she used Dead Hard right before the Adrenaline and had a huge boost to distance and an opened gate. I'm not salty, just upset that skill doesn't count unless you do asshole moves at some point. I guess that's why everyone is so toxic. not everyone can co-op with this frustration well. I mean I can't too sometimes. recently slapped pink Mori on my Doctor and crashed the toxic streamer swf but I didn't feel good about it cause it wasn't for skill but for the ridiculous offering. 
---
I love doing this as Freddy. It's so much fun. 😂
---
Dance with me+lithe =killer rq. Add Quick and quiet if you really want the overkill.
---
This is perfection.
---
You sir made my day.
---
yeah, I don't get it either.. so you bought a game, but not only do you not play half it you narrow it down by playing just 1 small part of the half you decided to play. 
---
The whole "maining" thing is stupid anyway but it makes perfect sense why you see a bunch of emotional posts trying to pass off as fact claiming " _____ gets screwed because devs clearly have ___ bias!! "  It's like fuck, maybe if you stopped tunneling the game and actually learned to play it maybe you'd actually get good and stop thinking the devs are out to screw you. 
---
Legion is very irritating to play against(and with for that matter).  Even if you do have a long chase against him, it feels inevitable that you'll eventually have to stop to mend and you'll get downed.  Where is the counterplay? Bait a vault and they fall for it and miss the swing, great now they just stab frantically 7 more times with no repercussion until it hits.  Same with successful 360s, and even pallets are basically just free hits for the legion.  I don't think they're OP or anything, just very unrewarding to play with or against.
---
Congrats, you got BHVR'd
---
pretty something something so far
---
i was it was Huntress channeling her inner Slav
---
Frankly if they made an alternative site specifically for sharing non-pornographic videos it seems very possible that there could be a mass migration from youtube. They're basically almost the perfect alternative if not for the additional challenges of advertising your channel there.
---
Love it! I'm in the progress of making my own Susie cosplay^^ What did you use for the wire and the buttons (not sure what to call it) on the mask (if I may ask)? 
---
I have no idea what is on the mask in-game, looks like sewing buttons but I'm not sure.
---
P
---
I swear ballanced landing is one of the most anoying perks due to how unexpected it is. You expect everyone to be running either sprint burst or dead hard that you ignore the possibility of ballanced or lithe.
---
only if your computer is trash 
---
They have not responded to any tweets mentioning the slow match making on twitter, even though they're tweeting all the time for surveys and questions. They're just focusing on the PC PTB (As always with PC), It would be nice of them to tweet someone back and be like "Yes, we're aware the matchmaking is super slow" but they're not instead they're asking people what their favorite map or killer are. The only time they ever really tweet about console is when they release DLC for it. And regarding the framerate issue, they had supposedly said they would release a big patch in December to help stabilize the games frame rate, but instead they released more cosmetics and had a blood hunt event then left us in the dark after that. Its been almost 2 weeks and they're still not disclosing the slow matchmaking. In my opinion that's showing they don't care.

Ruin's value can easily outweigh the value of a perk, or two, or even all three depending on how long the game lasts.   
---
Most good streamers believe if Ruin isn't taken down by the time you hook the first survivor it's served it's purpose.  
---
You have 4 survivors looking for a hex, say they spend 1 minute searching the map and they find it relatively early, thats 4 minutes of time tge survivors spent doing nothing.  Thana can't even remotely come close to that unless it's a super long game, or you're Legion.  In which case it's still great to run ruin.   
---
You're the only person on this sub that thinks ruin is bad, think about that.
---
You can only stalk the same survivor for so long. That might be the reason. 
---
I have gotten stuck on nothing before. Just stood there in the open. Couldn’t move at all. Crows fly around me. Yet when I was picked up I could wiggle. Then I get rescued and I couldn’t move again. Other times I’ll get stuck in a crouch and have to crouch for awhile. This game is odd. 
---
I assume that is because you sucked them dry? Myers can only get a certain amount of Evil Within from one survivor and when that is used up you won't get any more from stalking that survivor. This is indicated by the survivor being highlighted in red when stalking.
---
Always happens...
---
WTF one time a long time ago in a galaxy not at all far way there were no bloodlust... and the killers just got looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped, and looped so getting rid of that, even making it punish the killer would make the already overpowerd survivors to god. YOU DUMB FUCKING CUNT
---
Jack the Ripper + old London map, pretty please (*_*
---
Just letting everyone know the feet are there cause I'm too lazy to draw the whole body so I just did the feet.
---
You can only stalk someone for so long.  When they're a solid red colour, you can't get any more Evil Within out of 'em.
---
Yep they were definitely red. I never knew this. 
---
I barely saw them before the locker buff. Now I get 1 every 5-6 hours or so. 1 person has the OoO build while the other three usually seem to have Urban in their kit. Presumably so after the OoO warns someone I'm approaching they can Urban away long before I arrive.
---
agreed. I'm no good at Lery's unless playing Hag but it's always fun. and the Game I love as survivor even. 
---
Generally, never leave a Hex unless you're up against a Spirit, cause she's likely just running Haunted Grounds.
---
Assuming 5 upvotes per second, you'd be upvoting for almost two days.   
---
Still worth?
---
for whom?
---
For me, myself and i
---
I don't mind one-two ds per game, really. sometimes it makes difference but sometimes not. but 4ds and swf is a fukin cancer. 
---
Me too, I also plan on purchasing the cosmetic.
---
Wait how did he get the killer's username? I thought that was hidden until post-game for survivors
---
i agree, sometimes it takes for ever and the devs need to be informed about this but maybe you should tweet to them idk
---
this toxic shit right here is why i'm dreading their new Matchmaking system and not being able to dodge SWFs anymore.  I wish they'd give you options to opt out of getting matched with or against SWFs.. and if you're gonna complain that SWFs would never get games because everyone would choose that option, that should tell you how fucking unfun and shitty they are. 
---
Not to mention most of them are just a bunch of toxic flaming shitlords. You're lucky if 1 out of every 5 or so isn't just completely made up of 4 shitlords all waiting to flame you at the end for not playing how they think you should have or because of being on discord able to easily win waiting to tell you GGEZ, Uninstall shit killer. 
---
SWFs are the most broke dick, unbalanced shit they've added to the game that completely ruins it.  Shit's worse then NOED and DS combined... unless of course you just like EZ games with 0 challenge. Their fucking garbage to play against, and fucking worthless when you get matched with them. it's basically a 1 v 1 game at that point. 
---
oh good, there's nothing useful, that means i can keep grinding away the mmo funbucks
---
Where did you hear the music?
---
&gt; Why is this subreddit all memes now?
---
I think it all went downhill when the console versions were released. Which is sad because I really liked the old DbD subreddit.
---
&gt; pseudo infinite me around the shitshack because apparently the huntress is to slow to reasonably catch up with and stop this
---
Well there is no denial the shack is one of the best tools a survivor has for looping, which is kinda ironic, isn't it?
---
Also, the Huntress is probably the best killer to deny shack looping, so I hate to break it to you, but this is most likely entirely your fault.
---
&gt; is still heavily survivor sided
---
The game is still survivor sided, yes, but not as much as you think it is. It's just that, as killer, you have to concentrate waaaay more and make right decisions in order not to get destroyed. So just because playing survivor is easier doesn't mean it's *heavily* survivor sided.
---
&gt; I'm keeping my one sacrifice, and they can go fuck themselves. But they won't take that for an answer, nope.
---
I mean, why should they? It's way more fun and if done right, results in more points for both the killer and survivor. And there still is the chance that all survivors escape, so why not go for that?
---
&gt; call me a bad killer
---
So what? Just let them. It's the same as getting mad at tbagging. Just don't take it seriously. It's just a game after all. Who cares what other people say about you in a game? And if you can't ignore it, just close the post-game chat or leave the game immediatley.
---
&gt;  And there seems to me that there are still infinites.
---
Yes, you are right, you will catch them eventually but they are still huge timewasters. But no one is forcing you to chase them around "infinites"? Just let them go if you see them "abusing" them.
---
&gt; PS4 players have gotten many more killers and survivors for free
---
Just look at it this way: Console players won't EVER have the same experience as us PC players, in DbD or otherwise. So they basically wasted all their money on a game that doesn't even run properly.
---
&gt; I just wish to god that I could at least choose which teachable perks were appearing in my characters bloodlines
---
Why tho? Just because you made bad decisions early on they should rework the progression system?
---
Shift + Tab, View players, Recently played (if you're on PC). The one who isn't currently on your team will be the killer.
---
The screen shows that you depip but when you go back into the lobby it gets put back to how it was before.
---
Survivors get the hatch before I can even find it in 95% of my games, even if I do find it we have to stand-off which survivors usually always win
---
lol yeah, that's not tunneling. that's called you being bad and unhooking a survivor under the killers nose and not being able to body block. Why would someone go after you. who is healthy and requires 2 hits to be downed and not the guy who is injured that he just saw you save. You're fucking damn right I'm going to go for the easy low hanging fruit because you decide to throw yourselves at the killer trying to be overly altruistic.  You're not entitled to a free reset or 2nd chance just because you got unhooked. 
---
I liked the idea of rancor more than I did in reality
---
This is why they should give killers emotes. Like a thumbs up. Or like a hi five.
---
I had to leave that place after 10 minutes. I heard every image and got scared.
---
Is this a PC mod
---
I was told her addons that make searching jigsaw boxes take longer don't work.  So like, that's pretty disheartening right there.
---
Do you not see the problem? Even If you lose track of a survivor (and start like checking lockers and shit) but then find them again, you get a free down even though you played poorly. That survivor has to stop to mend and can't do anything about it. 
---
When you call hum daddy, but can’t even spell his name right
---
It really sucks ass. Yesterday I had infinite loading screen once or twice per hour of playing. 
---
LITTLE. LITTLE difference. There's also chance of finding good players at rank 3, 6, 8, 9 and 10, you silly fool :')  
---
The difference is so small because the playerbase isn't large and the majority are just bad/average/new/don't care about the game.
---
Pretty good job so far...
---
Im guessing survivor saying if you have say insta down hatchets on huntress then they will gen rush
---
The killer I was playing against seemed to know what she was doing so he just downed her and let me go after I teabagged her after she got downed lmao 
---
Shoot I played him earlier and grass seemed to be 50/50...
---
Pretty cool outfit. Sucks for the people that create fan art though as most of them picture her blonde.
---
dude.. just play your game the way you want to play and stop worrying about these fake rules survivors make up about how killers should play.
---
What are you going to do if you have a bad game and can only find the same dude all the time? Not chase him because you don't wanna tunnel? C'mon son.  You can camp if you want, you can tunnel some dude for 5 gens if you want.. sure you'll be punished for it by shit score , never ranking up and poor BPs. 
---
The more you play the better you'll be come and you'll learn when to stay in chase, when you change targets, when to rotate, when to give up on chase.. etc. There's no rule that says you have to distribute your hits and hooks equally across all survivors and if they all come in dressed the same.. fuck em.. they have no room to cry about tunneling. 
---
Honestly, you'll have a lot more fun if you just play your game and stop worrying that you're following rules made up by people who mostly play survivor about how you should be playing the killer.  No matter how "fair" you think you're playing, there's still going to be a Survivor\Killer who's still going to flame and bitch because you did X in the game or that you used X perk.

My experience have been worse in lol but itd just my experience a

Wow, no salt, no bitching. Nice
---
Overwatch would like a word. 
---
COME THROOOUGH!!!!!!!
---
Claudette is invisible. That's the joke
---
Game Over.
---
They really need to either give Claudette something on her physical person that stands out, or take out all her dark clothes and give her bright and light colored clothes.
---
Is this the actual unmasked Susie art?
---
She looks like a gremlin, jesus christ.

Entity that is deliberately blocking the sun for exactly that purpose: *Am I a joke to you?*
---
Don't worry bud. This isn't tumblr, you can swear here
---
No, cause EVERY game that happens. I don’t mean to sound hostile when I ask, but do you play killer? Cause if a killer makes a mistake, everyone calls you out on it in the most toxic way possible.  But more on topic, the thing with some mains is you don’t mean to main them, you just are good with them and get to high in ranks and can’t really, pick up a new killer you just got when you’re at rank 8.
---
Why are we still being put into games when not everyone loads in?
---
Lies! All lies!! I don't get to see David's or Jake 's exposed ass when the status took effect.
---
Totally unplayable. 
---
I know I wouldn't mind, especially for those event items that now have no use.
---
Look at 85% of her clothes in the store lol. Most of them are pretty bright 
---
No offense, but what rank are you?
---
What? The "its an opinion" thing? Whats wrong with that? Where's the lie?
---
They fixed that.
---
Let me guess... you were watching porn, weren't you...
---
I got hate by playing the clown once, " wow what a scumbag build.. kys"

I had Bamboozle, Pop goes, Coulrophobia and Brutal lol. Fuck me what perks *can* i use jesus christ 🤣

He thicc
---
He sicc

Most importantly

He predicc
---
And the ones that aren't bright? 
---
Still not as bad as p3 
---
Thanks
---
All of a sudden I am toxic because I want borrowed time to save people from people who camp and tunnel like assholes? Wow
---
That head with the Victorian or black wedding dresses will be such a serve tho, I’m gooped
---
If I stuck a lit cigarette in your eye I guarantee you'd change your mind.
---
fun and all, but i still cant take my eyes off of what i assume is joey, 
---
A cooldown on connecting to a new game and a temporary ban are functionally the same thing, just different wording.
---
When you were saving up for Victorian nurse but see this
---
They actually went back to calling it that I just had a brain fart.
---
On top of that you could only get the game free with ps plus so that means you and Sony spent money to let you use the game. Once ps plus is gone so is the game (I think)
---
I actually like the scarousal Id get from this warping in 5 inches from me before dying.  
---
“Niiiiiice?”
---
*Mori’d to death*
---
My point is that the devs should make Claudette easier to see, no matter what she wears.
---
Imagine if they gave her the black cloak instead
---
What rank are you? Rank 1 Huntress players do that quite often
---
The increased penalty from missed skillchecks is always there from the beginning.
---
I can picture a situation where they BOTH win.
---
Little did you know, my game hasn't gone unde 30... If you're going to whine about normal people enjoying a simple game, at least be realistic. Good luck bragging about your expensive PC, even though console is much cheaper, and still fully functional. 
---
so there are multiple points to this. 1. flashlights arent good anymore since the animation is very difficult to time on a flashlight save and there are multiple counters to them. 2. if you get blinded at a pallet you can still hear the survivor on their footsteps, rustling grass or other stuff in the enviroment and their cries of pain. 3. the screen turns red when you get blinded instead of white so it shouldnt be a problem on your eyes. you can also jsut look away if there is any issue since you need to hear when blinded not see. also lightborn can fix all your problems if you dont want to counter flashlights with other methods
---
I only get 31 fps on my pc
---
Legion and Fredward definitely the top 2. simply because both are mostly tunnellers due to how weak they are. 
---
Wraith who runs sloppy butcher: it’s so broken on PS4 it’s not even funny. Also find that Wraith’s are among the campiest. 
---
Likewise, my experience with survivors have always just been a quick "gg" then they leave, regardless of if I killed them or not. I admittedly hover around the green ranks most of the time, which may be a factor.
---
Happened to me too once , i think  the hatch has like qn actual keyhole and you have to stand infront of it but if its blocked by an object you can't get to it and yeh.
---
(This is just my theory on it. The only thing that makes sense to me tbh)
---
I'd like to hijack your comment to thank the Ochido fanboy 4 man swf I played againsrlt ages ago. You guys thought I was a baby Myers, teabagged and flashlight clicked at me while the mandatory DS obsession ran around me.
---
What you guys should've assumed was that I knew how to stalk, seeing as I stalked to T2, and the reason I wasn't getting to T3 was due to Judith's+Tuft. I could see you shitting your pants once you realized that. And thanks to the free 3 stacks of PWYF you guys didn't get far. 
---
The aftergame salt was just perfect with my fries, and I can't think of a better way I could've gotten Evil Incarnate.
---
The hatch crushed his head. How sad.
---
I wouldn’t really say it’s dead it’s still got a decently sized player base on consoles. It’s definitely spiraling down though, due to the devs being incompetent 
---
Exactly. Now go outside and play with the other toddlers your age. Maybe even brag about your 35 downvotes. 
---
I'm just waiting on this DS

---
**When you happen to go down the hill in a really awkward way and it doesn't proc**
---
Kills are only 1 of the 4 categories, and winning chases/slowing down gens/getting lots of hooks is vastly more important than getting kills.  You not only get significantly more bloodpoints by trying to get 12 hooks in a match instead of trying to 1 hook kill people, but you also get more pips.  It's hard to not at least safety pip if you hook each survivor just once, so hunt them down and don't worry about unhooks, since that means you get to hook them again later and get even more points.
---
As a huge TMNT fan this hit the spot, enjoy your karma.
---
Thanks for explaining it. The amount of downvotes that I got for asking a question though. Come on reddit you're better than this
---
hi fujin, toxicity in a multiplayer game is something that should always be expected no matter the game cause people are assholes.
---
I want to say someone did the math sometime back and came to the conclusion it just was not worth it if that is the goal.
---
Dude. Don't even count Myers in that list. On PS4, Myers is the most played by a mile. At least at red ranks. 
---
It’s just you
---
Its not "camping" its a bonding experience.

He looks impressive. Good job. Can't wait for this skin. 
---
I had it happen to me once, and I believe if the animation of jumping into the hatch would force you to overlap with some obstacle, then you just can't open the hatch.  It's a real bummer, whatever the actual reason for it is.
---
We live in a society 
---
It is just so frustrating to get stabbed 3 to 4 times in less than a minute and you can't really outplay that unless you are a god at 360s most of the time. You will go down pretty soon eventually and thats tilting. If a legion choses to tunnel someone that person is dead no matter what. 
---
legion cause legit has little to no counterplay if he has more then 5 braincells on how to play him
---
This has never happened to me. Hopefully you're able to find some sort of solution. 
---
Been wanting lycans and vampires forever, more supernatural shit BHVR! Wheres my mummy, frankenstein monster, zombie, Pirate? Enough of these pitiful humans and their various knives.
---
Karma for using those items
---
Buffing borrowed time. Borrowed time practically heals you to full lol, pathetic
---
Ruin has come to our family.
---
Also don't be like the people I played against today and try and body block a maxed Evil within mike
---
I'm incredibly disappointed because I watched that video wholly expecting another hatchet to come out of nowhere.
---
For all entity*
---
Man are you allright? 
---
You sound like the kid we all had in class who had to undermine some people's actions by saying he's superior with another story.
---
TFW the *invisible* killer gets the best skins :D
---
So going to use the body + tree head
---
It could be worse.
---
I had a Meg turn around and start chasing *me.*
---
I did that too. Was 100% worth it. That perk is so damn good
---
Heart has a animation loop for pump action.. not sure if it has any particle effects to squirt blood.  best part is its visible in FPV so killers can also have a little satisfaction of admiring Sallys heart in chase  while they go on wacking pesky survivors :P
---
Simply beautiful.
---
Imagine Tapp, David King, Adam Francis and maybe Bill go against a Susie.. Sure she might be able to stab one of em but if they worked together I bet they'd beat the crap out of her.
---
Maybe the entity gave her super human strength because every time she lifts one of the heavier guys and puts em on a hook it feels a bit strange to me. 
---
I played a decent level of Lol for years. There is certainly some toxicity, but it's almost always a disagreement about what is going on or a tactical dispute. Usualy directed at the jungler or support for not doing the impossible. Thats it though, it's just people arguing or occasionaly rash talking (which I've heard is worse in NA?)
---
DbD on the otherhand, toxic survivors exist in almost every game. There are many mechanical problems with the game that allow toxity and a fundamental disconnect bettween goals that causes a lot of salt and toxcity post game. I think the better a killer you are, the more you notice it as the same survivors that will 'gg' you if they escape, will 'kys' you when they don't. You start to see it as a fellow survivor aswell, although it's a lot easier to be dragged into it.
---
I'll say this, in the 6+ years I've played Lol, I haven't recieved the same hate that I have in just half a year of DbD. This is the worst gaming community I've ever seen. Followed by Dota and maybe the worst parts of the FGC.  
---
You gotta do it like a regular blind
---
Took me 200 hours😂😂
---
I understand what you mean. I'm normally a pretty nice killer, but I bought the Nightmare on Elm Street chapter just after Legion came out, as it was my last missing DLC, and I tried to learn Freddy in the week before the rank reset.
---
I seriously just had to play some ebony mori games, and use some disgusting builds on top tier killers, to alleviate the frustration from the toxicity I encountered.
---
Looks like they're all screaming at Dwight SWF
---
Pst! Hey ... wanna hear my M I X T A P E?
---
Haha this right here
---
I love this meme
---
Reeee no BBQ ETC. It's 5 bucks ffs.
---
Yeah. Rank reset. In the red ranks, it's almost always him.
---
Everyone thought this.
---
I was always thinking, what happens if someone has no time left? 
---
How difficult would it be to time it so they die before you even finish the hit animation?
---
What would it really be like to have them go from injured to dying to dead so fast?
---
It looks great!! If I ever cosplay I want Susie to be my first.
---
People was using words like Whomst'd've but now wanna get butthurt when they see the word Finna lol
---
A lot of people did. Lol
---
Then I see 4 options for you:
---
1. Get better so that you can still kill 2-3 of them and get the pip/BP
---
2. Be just as toxic and camp hooks when you get one. Probably switch to leather face to make it more efficient to keep hooked survivors on the hook.
---
3. Quit the lobby immediately postgame so they dont have time to say anything
---
4. Dont play killer
---
6. Every other killer is much easier than Freddy for me. I play with a couple rank 1’s who will agree as well.  If they just removed him from the game that would be great. 
---
Wait what I thought traps can’t go off if you’re down
---
AFAIK, new system isn't fully out yet. It available for some players on PC, don't know about consoles.
---
If you have NOED, sloppy butcher or any of the other killer perks like hex ruin i would swap them for the monitor, since the  smaller terror radius makes it harder to get that initial tier 1 madness
---
Dude tell us about feed
---
TITY !!!!
---
You go slower and give more time to get gens and stuff done. 
---
**\*BING BONG INTENSIFIES**
---
Im laughing so much rn
---
You get nearly a thousand bp just pulling someone in and hitting them. I can't remember exactly how much but he probably has the best deviousness, tied with mr bing bong.
---
What region? I play West NA and I rarely get toxic survivors maybe every 4 or 5 games but toxic killers are about 1 of every 2 on a bad day 1 of every 4 or 5 on a good day
---
Wrong
---
It's a Saw reference. SPOILERS: &gt;!That's Amanda, the woman under the Pig mask!&lt;
---
What platform 
---
Ah yes, I forgot about them.
---
I'm a fool...an utter baffoon and I have failed
---
But. Hold up. Green and Purple Calm add ons + M&amp;A. You now have a 12m Terror radius in Punishment mode. You're pretty much a faster Michael at the beginning.
---
It’s actually really good without doc, it may not seem that way but it is

Impossible. Buffing Freddy would require infinite + 1 gg's and that is not possible! F for Freddy!

those are secondary not mandatory objevtives that dont progress towards the escape

It would be really neat if all his victim's bodies could be found across the map; could lead to confusion to both survivor or killers.

Nice concept. Hopefully something this wicked comes this way.

PS [This for Mr. X's mori?](https://youtu.be/kY_KXXIIpnc)
---
Strangely I've had a Trapper on PS4 who had NoED but let us leave as two other players DC'd.  
---
Once the two players noped out he led us to gen's allowed us to complete them and then led us to the NoED once all gennie's were done!  
---
I was so shocked I just stood in front of him whilst he was swinging as the Claudette cleansed the Hex Totem, he never even tried to hit us and he had NoED up for a good while he could have easily downed us and finished the match but didn't.  
---
This was certainly an exception though, most Killers would have slayed us once the last gen popped. But this lovely bloke of Trapper showed kindness I thought I would never see from a Killer, still makes me smile.  
---
But this would be the one exception, 9 times out of 10 the Killer is gonna hack you down once they know they have NoED. Since we had two early DC's at the start of the match the Killer took pity on us. I wanted to get sacrificed as the Trapper was being super cool about it but he dropped me on the Hatch.  
---
But I would agree in most cases NEVER TRUST THE KILLER.  
---
We had three instances of Self Care in the shrine in 2018.

Hmmm wish they did more with his face, the nurse is much better.

#Pros:

PTB Access when they come around.

kb/m is very rewarding to learn.

End game chat so you can say "ggwp". (or get yelled at. one of the two)
---
BILL.
---
#Cons:
---
You have to re-acquire EVERYTHING, which includes DLC (Hag AND Doctor too!), perks, cosmetics, etc.
---
kb/m is very hard to get used to after playing with a controller. So many keys...
---
Players are better at the game because kb/m and good fps means better plays since you don't jitter everyone half a second.
---
that's about it for all I know. i'm tired as fuck, so i probably forgot something.
---
I bet the entity devoured his hope with that placement.
---
He's a menace!
---
Remember Folks: When you get back to Red Ranks, running Rancor will almost ensure you don’t have to interact with the obsession and just murder them cold later. If they’re running Decisive, just ignore them all game and come back to beep kill them later. 
---
yesyesyesyesyes please color it.
---
We can say :
---
*game over*
---
its nice that the devs put prove thyself in the shrine before they release the new patch
---
I always stop playing after I get flamed by a survivor for basically trying to counter them. They keep unhooking immediately so I stealth nearby a hook as wraith. About 10 seconds later a survivor comes up and tried to unhook as they’ve been doing all game. Like I knew you were going to do that so why would I not move to counter? I get flamed because I can stealth basically. 
---
See 2 survivors circling a hook? I’m camping because I’m trying to stop them. Like I can see you you’re right there why would I not? Atleast I respect the fucking Kobe. 
---
I cannot watch that full video, I've pretty much been keeping my knowledge of RE2 Remake as in the dark as possible outside of the E3 footage so I can maximize my enjoyment of it when it releases next week.  I didn't even play the demo, I just walked around the main hall to see how good I could make it look and deleted it after.  
---
But I will agree with that video ahead of time.
---
Not on console, at least not on killer side. Killer still sees people come in one at a time. So if multiple people come in, you know it's SWF still.
---
This is probably the hardest survivor achievement and i hate it.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
When your not camping the hook your just putting all 10 traps down.
---
Please just not. Overly sexual things don’t fit in the game imo. Although I like your artstyle.
---
Or just high ping survivors
---
Nope
---
So he actually stole the Nurse‘s heart. That‘s really creative and makes sense because the devs said those two killers are connected in a way.
---
I'm not old, I'm experienced, you young punk!

Additional PSA ... don’t body block a Myers... he might be in EW3...
---
Wait, how do you run without scratchmarks because of this ?
---
The Ultimate BM
---
Generally, most killers are underpowered. They're against the clock, and need to be applying constant pressure, which becomes very difficult when going against survivors that know what they're doing. Trapper in particular, who you mentioned, is one of the worse killers in the game. If you equip the perk "small game" you'll get a warning when facing a trap near you, basically countering him entirely with one perk.
---
Also, try playing killer, it will give you a good idea of what it's like. The first 5 to 10 ranks will probably be a cakewalk, but you'll likely start seeing the frustrations of playing killer very quickly. 
---
tfw ur making a shitpost and everyone act serious abt it
---
Wait and buy a new killer. It will be worth it for the money
---
U iz what is wrong with the game today. U give girls free wins because they iz girls. U need to get some dignity.
---
Why are you getting downvoted lmao
---
Literally at least half of rank 1 nurses dont even try to hook untill everyone is downed
---
In fighting games, there's usually only one or two characters I like to play as for various reasons (In MK9, Baraka and Striker had easy combos to learn and had amazing specials for a defensive play style), so those are the only characters I play, with the opponents being the variety in each game.
---
In DbD, I've kind of fallen into "maining" a particular killer for a while and then swapping off to another one and getting good with them. Except Freddy. Buying Freddy fills me with regret every time I get a Daily of his.
---
I'm saying it doesn't equate well to skill. I would say I was a compitant but not exceptional killer. I understand the game mechanics, I can locate and chase survivors effectivly  but I can be quickly out-played by survivors with strong looping or juking skills.
---
If rank was well correlated with skill I would expect to see four survivors of approximately similar ability. Yes some games would go better than others but on average I would have to play reasonably hard to get a decent win.
---
What I'm seeing - in the same trial, are survivors who don't seem to have any idea what's going on matched with other players who are leagues ahead of me skill wise but the end screen shows them all within a couple of ranks from each other.
---
yeah I found it some time ago when it was fun to be toxic
---
Kinda reminds of them at place in Hawaii where shadows appear once every bit of time.
---
her hair can be seen in the mist because of rendering issues, so there is that.
---
What lie? Lol, I am pointing out that people are saying playing killer is stressful.
---
So every game? Every single one of my games I have a Claudette and Meg. 
---
I think the killer overestimates me when I use bloodied clothes. I'm not nearly as good as they think :))
---
OP most likely excited/jittery because of title, guessing they made post after a interesting post game chat :p 
---
I’ll dodge if it’s four P3s with full flashlights or toolboxes since I know I’m just going to get salty. But I don’t particularly care about playing against SWF with mixed items. Also, sometimes one out of the four survivors might have a terrible ping and won’t leave so I’ll dodge since I’m not a fan of the extra lag.
---
That saw tho
---
there are bones for her jaw.. and in her idle animation there are poses where her mouth opens and closes.. not sure if its synched to her breathing sounds.
---
same
---
Meg seems to be the second most popular 
---
Sounds like someone got their shit rocked in a couple games recently.
---
Ignore the salty losers like this. NOED is a solid perk, especially to fill in the gaps when you have no teachables.
---
When you’re playing survivor, just make sure to jump on any dull totems you see and it’ll make your life easier.
---
I'm excited to see the frustration with these people when dedicated servers drop and they can no longer rely on lag switching to get kills.
---
I’ve had people get pretty mad at me for using an ebony Mori. I’m like, I have the item am I supposed to not ever use it?
---
Nah, IMO it goes Meg, Claudette, Nea, Feng, and Tapp for ps4. Dunno bout PC.
---
I love the "well haven't you played (x) game before?) comments. Everything is fucking toxic
---
Because you are indeed an asshole?Dont complain about teabagging at the exit gates then.
---
This happened to me too. The frontside spawned facing the wall of the shack and I could not open it. I was using the purple (dull) key. I died but lost the add on instead of my key thankfully. 
---
Dude why do you post 5 times a day?
---
The ultimate accidental BM
---
They cant break ruin, if you dont use ruin.
---
I mean what did you expect when you were toxic?
---
Have there been any confirmation about the % increase for rare items at Prestige 1,2 and 3? Is it even worth it to prestige if you don't care much for the bloody cloth?
---
I barely see tapps ever, I always see Adams though.
---
no, Ironworks of Misery. I really suck at it with Doctor. 
---
That makes sense too. Though I'm not sure how many P3s are as good as you think. I had my fair share of prestige survivors with me and I wasn't happy with their performance during the match. 
---
It depends on their rank as well.
---
Calculated.
---
Freddy isn't the best anything in this game really, to try and say that just because he has built in Deerstalker he's a better slugger than a killer that can down survivor much faster like Nurse or Billy is just wrong.
---
Distorsion remove your scratchmark when activated for 6/8/10s.
---
Oh no palletleeping, should we just in a straight line for you? 
---
Hitting survivors while they’re on the hook is the equivalent of survivors teabagging at the exit gates. Therefore you are indeed an asshole. 
---
People getting chased with empathy running towards you when injured
---
Yeah most people say Tapp isn’t used often but every 3 matches I get at least 2. Adam? The only thing I see are people using his perks.
---
I think it really depends on your build. If you're running a super try hard build like insta down hatchets with bbq, noed, and an ebony mori then yeah people get mad.
---
Spending too much time on that dbdgonewild
---
I've got all achievements on PC (119/119) and I can confirm you're basically gonna have to farm for deranged pursuit. 
---
What I did was get someone hit with deep wounds and made sure one more hit would down them. Then you use frenzy on one of their teammates, go right back to the original target and down them. 
---
It's poorly explained and super hard to pull off in normal games but if you farm it's doable. 
---
It’s just an opinion meant to be discussed.
---
There's a few perks that provide better tracking than BBQ often does with it's counterable aura reading. I don't think BBQ is a crutch in the slightest.
---
Huh, I guess I saw that it was a 60/50/40 cooldown and just thought it was an exhaustion perk. Thanks.
---
Thanks for doing these.
---
Can’t be reported but that is a dick move in my opinion 
---
different thoughts. I would use it for BPs,extremely useful when levelling up after a prestige
---
Alright, please give me some free wins. I have been doing horrible lately and could use a little boost
---
That doesn't make it a crutch, though.
---
I’m getting dodged 2 or 3 games before actually finding one. I guess equipping the P3 legacy makes peoples hate, even tho I’m never running any of their « crutch », and mostly memeing my games.
---
Why Clown? His power is simple but I argue just as boring as Huntress’s. Only thing I could agree with is that some of Clown’s addons actually feel horrible on survivor side.
---
People will get mad regardless of your build, I’ve found. I personally don’t use NOED with an ebony Mori since I don’t expect survivors to get that far anyway. I don’t particularly get the hate for BBQ, though. I just use it for the extra BP. And since locker hide auras now it’s not hard to avoid being seen.
---
Bill may be more of a con since you have to get him to unlock borrowed time, unbreakable and left behind. On Ps4, it's already given to you.
---
that's not a race, That's a shadow monster man
---
still alot considers it a crutch,and on billy/nurse it counts when you can be on your next prey in 10 secs or so
---
It's been a long time since I've seen *genuine* rank 20 gameplay. Thanks for reminding me. Jesus.
---
The best kind IMO haha. We have a load of laughs when playing
---
I don't think they have ever talked about the % increase for rarer nodes but I think it is safe to say that it is pretty much non-existent. So if you don't care about the cosmetic I wouldn't recommend it.
---
I always get this spot on this map.
---
This map has best totem spawns ever, good job with hiding them.
---
Lookout guys, we have a badass over here.
---
Central park sort of thing,mayb?
---
Imagine a dark NY around you
---
R/dbdgonewild is gonna have a fucking field day with that.
---
Lol
---
Yes. It’s not impossible, just get out there and play her until you get good with her. I have the Xbox one X though which is why I said “unless you’re talking about frame spikes”.
---
That's the most important thing. I remember my first time playing this game, it was a real blast back then (and I didn't do much better I'm sure). The only difference is that really nobody knew how to play the game back then - now if you guys rank up even a little bit you will be up against people who have quite some experience in this game. But you will definitely learn quickly, don't worry!
---
If they did all that, the game would have been more popular. Not sure what you're going on a rant for.
---
The friendly banter from killer mains to survivor mains is good for the game....keeps interest level up. Some people take it too serious yes, but for the most part it's friendly.
---
And it's not that hard to match the killer in BP as a survivor. Easy actually.
---
Getting one kill in a SWF group can ruin that persons game. That is all i need in my satisfaction of being a killer.
---
Weird choice to make them like the spirit, but I get it.
---
I think...
---
this sort of thing happened to me too,leatherface didnt move,gens were all on,i blinded him for bloodpoints,still no movement and then he smacked me and killed 3 other with noed.i was laughing so hard
---
Clown's power is uninteravtive, with Huntress you can dodge it and are rewarded for doing so, it's about both player's skill equally m
---
&gt; someone who dosen't have a credit card (and will never get one) that's a fucking godsend.
---
If you're so paranoid, just open a second checking account with limited funds. Only transfer money to that account when you need to spend it...and use it's debit card on Steam. BOOM problem solved.
---
A killer tunneling = a killer doing what he is meant to do and trying to kill a player
---
A killer camping = a killer doing what he is meant to do and trying to kill a player
---
Think about your logic again. Genrushing in this game makes matches last 5 minutes.
---
That build is just an easy way to get a 4k without any skill. Same with running an ebony with unlimited tier 3 with noed and everything. Basically would be unlimited sprint burst with multiple insta heals if a survivor had an eq. add ons and perks.
---
yeah, in practice it's just a shittier bitter murmur
---
“It’s nurse or nothing” ~ next dbd trailer (seriously though I could go play nurse and just wipe the floor over and over but playing one killer for ever isn’t incredibly entertaining)
---
Is that the nurse’s heart impaled on his weapon? She has a hole in her chest where her heart is.
---
&gt; less features.
---
Epic has great matchmaking and in-game voice chat. What other features do you need in a game?
---
Epic mastered cross-platform voice chat without the need to party up. Ever played Fortnite with a mix of consoles...it's absolutely flawless. Name a Steam powered game that is similar?
---
True but the bottle doesn’t kill. That’s why you have infinite on you. You can still loop Clown fairly easily.
---
i tend to play with low volume if its late at night to not disturb the family :D  
---
my fault there 
---
For some reason I thought the guy was Ace.
---
get yourself some good headphones. Absolute game changer!
---
I main Freddy, but I just started playing Billy over the weekend. I never realized just how imbalanced killers were until then. Freddy can be forced to stand and watch as a generator is completed in front of them. Billy can one shot multiple survivors across the map in seconds. That's just weird game design. 
---
Not you, just overall survivors that complain about this.
---
🚨🚨 Salty killer main Alert 🚨🚨
---
First of all, you can easily win a game by purposely not tunneling like a fucking dweeb and ruining the game for the survivors 
---
Second of all, if you camp on the hook against good survivors you’re gonna get destroyed easily by the other ones doing gens (which I assume is why you think gen rushing is so effective, because you camp)
---
Gen Rushing is just the killer term for 'survivors doing the only objective to get out, because they want to get out.' It's just doing gens and it's not toxic, it's just the game.
---
Mamma didn't raise no quitter
---
This
---
I'm not sure why it would be considered toxic. It's not even a thing, it's survivors doing what they're supposed to do. 
---
I've played so many competetive games over the years and they all have trash salty hate mail and tactics.
---
But Resident Evil 5 Versus Mode (back in the 360 days) and DbD are probably top tier for toxic behavior, salty players and excessive hatemail in my experience.
---
The sheer VOLUME of it and the lengths people would go is astounding.
---
Never supposed to use it. Unless you’re very not confident that you can win the right way...
---
I get that. I’m just saying people get mad no matter what. Of course someone would be mad against a sweaty build like you described, I do when I play survivor. But as a killer I’ve had all sorts of reasons people message me complaining. Yesterday someone DC’d on the hook and went on a rant to me because I didn’t eat his DS. I was just saying some people get mad over anything.
---
So? That doesn't make him fun to play against.
---
lol...know what else is dumb? Rhetorical btw :)
---
Yea, that's the main reason I'd use it. That and some non-serious endgame builds.
---
&gt;  I would absolutely support an 'everything ends up on steam' movement.
---
But for that to happen there must be competition. Have you seen the Movies Anywhere system for digital movies? You know why it happened? Competition!
---
You know why Valve doesn't make games anymore and we'll never have HL3? Because of their monopoly on the store, they make too much money to even try any more.
---
Share my experience with my Dbd friends
---
The spider juice is really good man, it changes people!
---
Thus why he's on both sides. He's another survivor to play, but you gotta level him to get his perks.
---
I would agree with this. It's a fair assessment. But what if the killer decided to face camp when it happens? Like would it be fair to say that this is the best thing they can do to try and get at least one kill before game ends? 
---
Ok

* Prove Thyself

* Unnerving Presence
---
**Perk** | **Unique to** | **Cost** | **TL;DR Description**
---
---------|----------|----------
---
Prove Thyself | Dwight Fairfield | 2.000 IS | Increased speed for every nearby survivor (max. 3)
---
Rancor | The Spirit | 2.700 IS | Obsession perk. Each time a gen is completed, survivor's location is revealed to you and the obsession sees your aura. IF all gens are completed, the obsession is exposed and you can mori them.
---
Tenacity | Detective Tapp | 2.000 IS | Increased crawling speed. Recovery is possible while crawling
---
Unnerving Presence | The Trapper | 2.000 IS | Survivors within your terror radius have a greater chance of triggering skill checks with a reduced sucess zone.
---
I should‘ve read the perk description more closely. I use it all the time and I thought it only blocks aura reading lmao. Good to know!
---
I think there are rules. You can only open the hatch if you have enough generators done per people still alive + 1. I think you need to fix all gens to use the hatch with everyone alive. It is possible to have the full team jump in. It's even an acheivement/trophie. Also it's only open 30 seconds or so.

Wow, Prove Thyself just before the upcoming buff. Good boy, random, lemme pet'cha
---
They spawning at the same time does not mean 100% SWF. Sometimes SWF may have delay between joining, sometimes randoms can join at the same time. Specially considering BHVR is supposed to be testing a new matchmaking algorithm that should, in theory, make it so that all survivor always join together.
---
congrats fellow p3 freddy :) it's not that bad. i have all 59 perks tier 3 on p3 quentin. people told me i should get help. 
---
You're not doing it right. If you want to have fun in this game you have to be as toxic as humanly possible. The resulting post-game salt / threats of being reported for unreportable behavior means it's working.
---
What.
---
Nice try but Freddy is invisible 
---
You know they’ve recently talked about Freddy in a livestream? From the sounds of the dev live streaming the Freddy changes are soon tm   
---
Way to miss the message completely, ggwp

I main her cuz she’s invincible. End of story!

If you can't beat em, join em. Be as toxic as you can be.

it’s always a claudette, always

True, i would say that its more like every two games, but still

---
Sure, how hot are you from 1 to 10? If its above 7 ill do it.
---
I like one of Noob3's comments - "There's currently a game in this bug." 
---
I sure hope he's getting some changes soon. He's my favorite killer to play, and while he is a ton of fun he is also definitely a bottom tier killer.
---
I don’t know why gen rushing is consider toxic either. If a killer knows survivors are doing gens, then killers should patrol gens like crazy. The auras are shown to the killer anyway, so take advantage of it
---
I just mean the hag splinter 
---
Nope, a key.
---
Is it bad to use the Susie skin? i just think it's cute :(
---
I agree it’s a major problem that they should fix ASAP 
---
Really?
---
Guess I have found a new thing to do to these scumbags.
---
Plays Dead by Daylight on PS4. Truly beyond dedicated.
---
I’ll say it again, yeah it was a good hatchet throw, above average, but people who main the huntress get crossmap snipes atleast once every 4-5 games
---
You cant play the game without ps plus anyway due to it being online only
---
Ya know, this has to be the best response Ive seen.  Its called a 3 gen strat
---
bunch of A N G E R Y white dudes in this comments section mad about words.
---
Neither are you, apparently. 
---
Distressing+bbq ez 40k bp
---
easy counter, called 3 gen strat, which is crazy easy to pull off
---
Sprint Burst is still the top of the food chain.
---
Lithe is second for me, and while pulling it off can be annoying sometimes because getting hit through the window you’re vaulting practically makes the sprint worthless by giving you a free sprint from the killer hit. But a successful Lithe use will 9/10 times break chase, if even for a second, which will reset the Bloodlust timer instantly.
---
Balanced Landing is probably on par, if not a little worse than Lithe due to the predictability and need for setup. But the stun reduction as a passive bonus is immensely useful for certain maps. There are some maps where Balanced Landing is useless however, like Shelter Woods. 
---
And then there’s Dead Hard. It’s not bad by any means, it’s just not at all as useful as the others, requires good timing, works maybe once before the killer becomes wise to your strategy, and then just gets right on your back to hit you.
---
*laughs in NOED*
---
I'm not sure I make the connection.
---
The title’s a quote from Freddy vs Jason
---
Completely agree but you have to admit that using Unbreakable to actually escape when you 100% otherwise would have died is one of the single greatest feelings in the game. 
---
The combination makes for a great meme build. 
---
Saw Puppers play a similar animation of Dwight performing the Legion mori on the Legion killer.
---
BBQ and Chili was intruduced in 2016, and was a shrine perk about 8 weeks after bubba was added. Since then it has never reappeared.
---
*'hello zepp' intensifies*
---
dc lol /s
---
And the killet would be Monica from Friends
---
Say that to him. He was a complete potato too, or maybe he had a little breakdown because I was playing with my friends and we kind of bullied him (all we did is run him around, but no matter who he chased - he was not able to get to us) there. As long as I remember, he DC-d.
---
disable the perk on wraith for all platforms lmao. it makes my pc chug too.
---
I'm pretty sure this exploit is platform wide and not limited to just console. The only difference is that the devs don't give a fuck about console or its players.

If it's from a new-ish DLC, it's 250k, but most of them are 150k.
---
I think the addon isn't worth sacrificing an addon slot / The chest idea seems pretty cool tho.
---
It’s actually pretty decent. Watching Freddy and Jason fight is great but, as with most horror movies, the characters are terrible. If you’re looking for something scary to watch, you won’t find it here. But if you just want to see Jason duke it out with Freddy, you’ll be satisfied.

I want to see more maps that change as gens are done, like opening and closing loops

I play this while I sit in queue. I still haven't gotten past the first part of the story to let me into the online play. That's the only part of the game I find irritating.
---
That's the pathetic thing. I'm a survivor main, and very rarely try killer. I'm just horrible at killer, and I know this. I stay in rank 18-13. End game chat is often full of "Shit killer" "KYS" "Go play survivor" like... dude, I'm literally only here for either an adept achievement or a daily. You think I'd intentionally play killer otherwise? Even at shit rank, I get either folks who are actually brand new and don't understand looping/the mind games OR folks who are deadly accurate with flashlights, tbag all game, slam me at every pallet, BM at exit gates.

You get more points for playing like a killer, not a camper. It even increases the fun factor for all players.

Wouldn't mind a hotel type location with 2-3 floors. Will also admit that chinese knock off, the "Market" type level (not sure exact name) looked pretty sweet.
---
And everyone thought it was just a simple meme, something to laugh of.................... they were wrong.
---
Well if they’re all p3 then they prolly have played so much they don’t even need points anymore. The only fun they get now is messing with killers
---
Ah yes the "i dont want you to tier up on me ever again" strategy.
---
If you do it properly, they'll only be able to tier up on you if they're about 95% to tier 3, which rarely ever happens unless they're 4000 IQ.
---
Was there any thought put into this post 
---
Leatherface, hence BBQ, was released in Sept. 2017. 
---
From www.twitch.tv/jose0855
---
This was a buddy’s stream this morning. 
---
That's because the change is the perk says "15%/20%/25% to all action speeds except repair speed". It doesn't effect repairing anymore. Prove-thyself does however, and counters the new co-op efficiency loss.
---
Any chance you were in madness 3 against a doctor? Because you can't use your items in madness 3. It took me a minute to figure that out when it came to using a key. 
---
Other than that, like others have said, it may have just been a shit rng spawn where it was glitched in a way that you couldn't access it. 
---
Ahh so it's the cheese-thingy 90% of all pig-players tend to do (sadly), got it. Thanks a lot for the explanation.
---
Haven't played the game that much the last bunch of months so I didn't experience a Legion doing that with Deep Wound. But as there are too many pigs doing this I'm already aware of that. Just didn't knew that it has already received a term. Just like "dribbling", which I actually got to know as DS-exploit. But well, I guess people tend to find terms for everything that could actually make 'em feel bad lol.

If none of these work, send a ticket to bhvr and tell them the things you have done but didnt work

Then yeah, it was probably just an unfortunate RNG where it was partially blocked. Should be a very rare thing. I've only had it happen once or twice in the year and a half I've been playing. 
---
Lmao I love League of Legends
---
i cracked up to hard at work 
---
That‘s why we also need shirtless Adam
---
You have hatch standoff, so why you want to close it also?
---
You can't "reshuffle" the bloodweb, but you can buy through infinite bloodwebs at level 50. Meaning, if you want to max out a character's perks without ever prestiging them, you still can. Level 50 bloodwebs will keep going and reloading forever, as if you were still leveling up. 
---
How about “no” to both of them?
---
I’m sure it’s nice to imagine how easy a game would be if you could close the hatch, but that’s the point, it would be too easy for a killer win at the point in the game, and isn’t fair to the survivor who lasted the longest, especially considering the amount of work they’ll have to do to make up for the fact that their team is gone. 2 minutes to get a gen online. The killer will almost always find them easily and set their gen progress back, and get an easy win at that point. If a survivor has more than one gen to do, it’s beyond easy for a killer to stay right next to the closest 3 gens, and again attain an easy win because the survivor will HAVE to come out there eventually. 
---
The hatch creates a threat to the killer. They can go looking for the survivors who might be on a gen, or they have to keep proximity to the hatch to keep them from exiting. It gives the last survivor a fighting chance.  Nobody likes a hatch standoff, but this is still not the way to fix it. 
---
So no, 1000 times, no. This never made it into the official game, and it’s time to let it go already. 
---
As for creating traps from chests. Again, no. You have two killers that can already set traps, to start . There are now trap hexes as a perk that cause all survivors to be exposed. Then to top it all off, you have Franklins. Killers don’t need trap chests as well. 
---
Good lord. Killer have crap like Pink Mori, the absolute most OP offering in the game. You don’t need more traps as well. 
---
It's still hilarious even so lmao
---
That's just good sense right there.
---
I've said it before I'll say it again, I usually see success with freddy even in rank 1, he's definitely not the best but he's kind of been memed to oblivion, freddy definitely has his problems but I genuinely don't think he's as bad as people think he is.
---
It depends on your reason for prestiging. If you're only doing it for the "rewards," then you're probably better off avoiding it, since the "rewards" aren't great. But I'm a grinding whore, so I love the idea of having multiple goals to achieve in a game. So I personally go for P3 max on everyone. It gives me a lot to keep working towards. If I didn't, I would probably have everyone maxed by now and wouldn't have anything else to grind, really. 
---
Remind me to make a crappy watermark for our memes next time :ok_hand:
---
This 100%. I’m P3 for 4 survivors, and 30k isn’t enough incentive to play killer to know how it feels to be teabagged every match, I’d rather get hit repeatedly by a camping myers/camperface than endure killer rumble tumble galore.
---
And with the latest major update bringing in the bug/DC galore it is hard to keep high spirits as a survivor main when 4/5 matches is DC at loading screen ( which makes me wait 5 minutes to load in because of DC OOF) 
---
SWF let alone Duo que you might as well do your laundry while you wait on PS4 ( slowly getting better now that killers are starting to come back and play after being burnt out on 2x event)

wah
---
And just like that, there is one less person now playing Dead by Daylight. 
---
&gt;new co-op efficiency loss
---
FYI, it's not new. It's been in the game for at least a year.
---
The patch notes was just mentioning fixing some bug with the co-op efficiency loss system.
---
I even tested with a friend when I saw that line in the notes, and confirmed that even the current build still reduces efficiency for two people. It takes one person 80 seconds to repair, so without a penalty it should take two people 40 seconds. It took us about 44.5 which is exactly what the wiki has said for years.
---
Same for the 500 identicals legion rants
---
Np
---
Yes, I don’t like that particular one either, I am sorry :D
---
I do that a lot, but it was really satisfying recently when I saw a Nea going for the unhook when I was on top deck of the swamp cabin, kicking a gen. Dropped right on top of her as Clown and yanked her right off. Large Lad Dynamic Entry.

Just to be annoying ! It helps counter quick saves and the healing  of a downed  survivor in some situations.

Do you call Myers the Shape and Freddy the Nightmare too, then?

---
Spirit
---
This would have been pretty good, then you hit all the best memes and it became amazing.
---
I never do both of them, only one. Then, you hit the other side of the map immedietly and do a gen there. As log as your team aren't complete monkeys. which.... *exhales*... You should avoid the lock.
---
But as a killer, if I see you move from one gen, to the one immedietly next to it, I'm going to find a different 3 to set up, you will still run into the same problem.
---
We get it again 
---
Unless you use good add-ons, Freddy is still the worst killer. The only success I have seen, and had, with Freddy is against new survivors of people who freak out at the sight of Freddy. He is very easy to play against in reality. 
---
Wouldn't it kill them anyways because they had the RBT on? Or does it not work for the hatch?
---
SB is good, but the loss of your ability to run around the map without losing it is a rather distinct loss.   Unless you are one of those "Urban Immersion" people who literally run around crouching 95% of the time.
---

Kind of like the whole Addam's Family/Munsters thing. Granted AF had been in existence due to the newspaper cartoons they first appeared in, but still. Both TV shows were thought up, created, and executed so closely together that they premiered like a couple of weeks apart but were still both completely independently developed from one another. 
---
Noice Rancor is in the Shine! Easy 250k BP. Think I might even grab Prove Thyself.
---
That’s terrifying yet hilarious.
---
I main both too. If they are popping gens like crazy that isnt fair play, thats them having 4 people on a gen at once while sprint bursting across the entire map. This is not how this game is supposed to be play. Running around like fucking monkeys toghether is not a fun experience for either side. It is simply not fun and is there just to win faster. You cant say running around with absolutely no fear of having any danger is fun to play as a survivor, and you cant say running around like a dumbass while having people repair the gen right behind you since there is 20 of them is fun either.
---
I won't but ok. I always do the 2 right next to each other then a gen in the middle of the map. It really splits the rest up and fucks that 3 gen start all the way up.
---
You press and hold the power button (it's the right mouse button by default for PC) and if a survivor is in your line of sight your Evil Within meter goes up. While doing that you are slowed and survivors are highlighted in white.
---
You can only get a certain amount of Evil Within from one survivor and if that is used up you won't get any Evil Within by stalking that survivor anymore. You can see how much a survivor has been stalked by the color they are highlighted in when stalking. The more you have stalked the survivor, the more red it is.
---
I think you can get around 4-5 EW 3 without add-ons.
---
Complete chaos, my point exactly &gt;:)
---
Surprised she didn’t hear you, deaf huntress. 
---
He can simultaneous be very bad and very bad for the health of the game. 
---
Without addons, he’s not strong at all, but he *is* extremely unfun to play against. No matter if the survivor is infinitely better than the killer, Legion **will** down them, either by moonwalking the deep wounds or just repeated stabbing. 
---
He needs a complete rework to be both viable and fun to play/play against. 
---
Wouldn’t this killer be heavily countered by just avoiding lockers?
---
But why should I have to be nice? Survivors are never nice to me. They do whatever they can to escape. And my job in the game is to kill so
---
Welp, we kinda screwed I guess
---

---
The more I look at it the better it gets...
---
I've done well in red ranks with just range addons, pill bottle, hell even red paint brush + Monitor and abuse, and getting addons isn't an issue if you know how to get bps which with freddy is extremely easy lol.

I honestly dont understand why Survivors complain about dying. Even when i die as a survivor its Just a game. "Oh but the killer face camped me", well If Its in the game the killer is trash because It used It? If You died this means you fucked up in the match and is your fault.
---
Each Survivor has a limited amount of "stalk juice" that Myers can get from them. The less they have left the more red they become. Once solid red they're fully tapped out and won't give any more stalk progression.
---
As for getting to EW3, I think you can get 6 or 7 if you fully drain everyone. Though add-ons that increase the amount of evil required to hit tier 3 reduces the number. I think if you're perfect with your stalk you can get 3 using Tombstone Piece, and 2 using Judith's Tombstone.
---
Addons to increase a lot the number of lockers and increase the range that You jump out of them?
---
RBT doesn't trigger from the hatch.  It can be a good hail mary if you know you can't viably get the trap off (Pig running the addon that makes there be 1 trap and 1 box period) if your team actually gets out of the match quickly.
---
So you're saying forcing a survivor to stop and do an action outside of normal gameplay is wrong? Its a slow down perk...kinda like putting people in dream world as freddy or bear traps as pig, theyre meant to make the survivors do other things outside of gems and totems(and heavily punish you for not doing your new objective). There is ways survivors can heal and outplay ive had people do it on me during a chase by doing it bit by bit when i get stunned or while looping. And things like pebbles, insta heals, selfcare, and other survivors exist to throw off killers and allow survivors to get time and or get away to mend.
---
I can respect that. 
---
Not really 1s still a depip and a very very low bp gain
---
Fair enough, but I believe on average, especially compared to other killers, he is the weakest killer.
---
Thats a you problem then
---
Bitter Murmur only applies to the gen completed, Rancor applies to all living survivors.
---
Ah,okay.  I don't have Pig and never got to that point in a game with her, just knew that RTB kills at escape gate. Thank ya
---
Clown is my favorite killer but the spirit I believe is a better overall killer. If I had to choose one I would say get the spirit first and if you have the extra funds down the road pick up the clown. Clown isn’t a bad killer he’s actually pretty good a fun. For example you can counter certain survivor perks by putting on certain add on’s their are bottles that trigger the exhausted effect on saviors which could cancel their sprint Burst or the one add on let’s you down a survivor in one hit if you hit them directly with a bottle. But unfortunately he lacks map pressure which is what the spirit does relatively well but she is hard to master. Hope this helps ! 
---
They don't need powers. There's four of them and they have knives. You ever win a fight against a person with a knife?
---
Whispers is a really good perk but if you don't have it or you dont want to use it because you want to use different perks, it becomes one of those things, if something like this happens a lot, then use whispers, but if you dont have many games where this happens, then dont use it, I use whispers for all my killers, really helps out. 
---
No matter how much muscles you have, it wont stop a knight -.- 
---
Yeah if anything it's a better Bitter Murmur
---
I agree it’s annoying. What’s more annoying is when it happens, and your fellow survivors aren’t taking advantage by popping generators while the killer is camping. 
---
Thanks I’ll be sure to get the membership next time I stop by the front desk
---
Alright, what's the sauce on this
---
Yeah... I don’t like that one as well ^^‘
---
Someone on here did some data collection and determined the difference to be so negligible that it technically falls within the margin of error, meaning effectively no difference. Prestiging is only worth it if you want to cosmetics, or if the constant reminder you can every time you level P0 50 irritates you.
---
It's a fun combo. You'll probably still get your booty licked because saboing means you aren't doing gens and they will get you eventually, but it's supposed to be enjoyable.
---
Lmao sadly there is no source image
---
I fucking LOVE IT
---
You have to at least agree that the hatch mechanic is terrible. Giving the killer the ability to close may not be necessary, but something needs to be done about it.
---
This is where you disbelief suspends. Not the whole part about not dying when you die. Nah, because Legion teenagers.
---
The cherry picking in this community. Hag is more spindley than any of the edgy kids but nobody talks about that. 
---
Will never understand why people criticize other people’s writing on the internet,  that’s annoying.  Sounds to me like you need to switch up your perks. Some enduring, spirit fury or bamboozle outta help you take care of those toxic survivors. Good luck ! 
---

---
Well Doctor makes skill checks appear in a random spot on screen which makes them harder plus unneverving, and if you also run overcharge the overcharge skill check is a bugger. Now good enough survivors can hit that, but even relatively decent ones will struggle to do it consistently.
---
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY BORROWED TIME NEEDS A BUFF, BUT THE AMOUNT OF INSIDIOUS CAMPERS I'VE ENCOUNTERED RECENTLY MAKES ME THINK BORROWED NEEDS A BUFF. IT'S LIKE THEY SAW THAT BORROWED WAS IMPLEMENTED TO COUNTER CAMPING, BUT TOOK IT AS A CHALLENGE TO CAMP EVEN HARDER.

MY BUDDY GOT FACE CAMPED ON THE HOOK LAST NIGHT AND I ESCAPED. FELT BAD FOR HIM BUT WAS GLAD I COULD GET OUT. NEXT MATCH, I GOT FACECAMPED. KARMA IS A MF BITCH. 
---
yeah but bitter murmur gives you actually usable information for catching survivors. with rancor its more often than not "heres a gen thats being worked on and will be don ein 10 seconds, good luck"
---
Iron maiden, iron grasp or agitation or both and a insta down perk would help this killer by downing Survivors and taking them to the basement through a locker
---
I AM ANGRY THAT SURVIVORS KEEP COMING INTO MY SHACK ITS CALLED KILLER SHACK FOR A REASON STOP TRYING TO COME INTO MY HOME ITS MY CHEST AND BASEMENT 
---
I'm just saying it's a good perk. Sorry you died to NOED. It happens.
---
I'd be really keen to see this when it's done.
---
Self-Care, Lightweight, Urban, and Lithe. 
---
Shirtless Dwight pls 😭
---
Always break dull totems, but if it's a Hex and you aren't currently cursed, leave it. Remember where it is, in case it turns out to be bad, but breaking it just because it's there is how you get Haunted Ground.
---
Playing games for fun and not to win!? Get outta here!
---
(I'm the same as you)
---
Damn anything pass 60% in game is intolerable for me
---
Urban evasion, iron will, speed burst and self care or we'll make it.
---
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY BORROWED TIME IS BASED ON TERROR RADIUS AND NOT PROXIMITY! IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME UNLESS THEY WANTED KILLERS TO HAVE A WAY TO SAFELY FACE CAMP/TUNNEL, AND I THOUGHT THE REASON THEY ADDED IT WAS SO IT WOULD HELP COMBAT CAMPING!
---
Spirit's one of the best killers, I'd personally say pick her. She's a little weird to play at first, but nothing too difficult.
---
Legion is fun, but really isn't that strong. Can end up being very frustrating to play when against good survivors, as they'll know you're fairly weak and cheese the shit out of you.
---
&gt;Also find that Wraith’s are among the campiest.
---
I mean... Im not gonna defend campers, but its extremely easy to see why they'd camp with Wraith
---
With 4 survivors, you really only need 1 of them to screw things up.  Sure there will be games where it isn't a factor, but there will be plenty where it is.  
---
To me this would be similar to saying not to run ruin/lullabye/etc. since totems aren't that hard to find and purge.  It's true, but there'll be one game every few where it REALLY slows them down.  Others, they'll find it immediately and it was wasted.
---
Thanks for the response, I think I’ll play her!
---
Edit: I found self care overrated, so I suggest you get used to play without as you'll learn to juke or hide by necessity.
---
EXACTLY! IT'S LIKE THEY WANTED INSIDIOUS CAMPING TO BECOME A THING!
---
That's fine, but OP pretends a blanket buff is going to make things better for everyone in the game.
---
Better yet, just don't teabag in general (only in a perfect world) 
---
Very helpful, thank you kindly!
---
No problem, have fun!
---
Everything stacks with We'll Make It. The 100% cap is for the perk effect only. Meaning you can't unhook 3 people for 300% bonus speed.
---
Claud is most common besides that, it’s pretty even, except the lack of Quentin’s and Tapps. 
---
Honestly I think most Myers use the 95% T3 strategy, it’s a pretty easy and incredibly useful technique
---
We aren't looking for a buff as much as a rework. Despite that, any buff is going to make things better for the poor guy in his current state.
---
WAITING 30+ MINUTES IN LOBBY TO FINALLY GET A MATCH AND GET FACECAMPED TO DEATH
---
Aw thx. I think it should be a legit cosmetic 
---
That’s how the police started to theorize that Jigsaw wasn’t commiting the murders now, as the new killer basically “cheated” to ensure the people died
---
I dunno if I'm gonna get wooshed but it's Dwight, not Tapp.
---
Thank you for the response! Currently I’ve been using self care(2) empathy(3) sprint(2) urban(1)
---
&gt; which rarely ever happens unless they're 4000 IQ.
---
lol yeah totally true, almost never happens 
---
lol
---
They also talked about changes to Decisive and actually showed gameplay of what it might be like. That was months ago.
---
Yeah you can definetly see that DbD was never intended to have swf.
---
Thanks for the response! I figured it was just my imagination thanks for clearing that up.
---
My pleasure!

---
He didn't see your aura with BBQ, so he checked the obvious possibility why. Nearby lockers.
---
Soon tm 
---
Oh yes. I do agree. Nobody enjoys a hatch standoff. The problem right now is that a very unbiased part of me firmly believes that any change to the hatch system will immediately go in favor of either survivors or killers. 
---
So it’s less of “changing the hatch system” that I’m for, and more of “be rude of it and implement something new that’s not boring or dull, but also fair”. 
---
What that would be? I don’t know. 
---
I just don't like that she has weapons RIGHT THERE and doesn't use them
---
Killers and survivors should (and to some degree are) be balanced in a manner that leads to 2k games.  This is most equitable for everyone in the game.  Any rework should lead the killer to have abilities which counter perks used.  I agree the dream state transition has some issues at higher ranks, but some of the shit at low ranks is just fucking embarrassing.  My friend and I were SWF, and he was the obsession with remember me.  This random Nea thinks it's a good idea to beat us to the exit gate and try to open it, INSTEAD OF LETTING THE OBSESSION do it!  We were pointing at the Nea and trying to get her off the door.  We both ended up dying along with a third person, and the fucking Nea escaped.  In the post game chat she said, "sorry, I tried.". This game cannot be balanced for high rank players because they are not the majority of the community.  The majority has survivors on their team that make mistakes like this.  The state of the game is actually not bad, but only like a week after rank reset, which is another broken aspect of the game.  Despite all the things I hate about DBD, though, it can be a really fun game when people are all trying to have a good time.  It only takes one sweaty killer or salty survivor to break it.
---
If you want a nice stealthy build, keep urban evasion and iron will, but then add in Distortion and Calm Spirit. 
---
You’ll be one stealthy boi!
---
But seriously, urban evasion lvl 3 is bae. You can crouch when the killer comes near and basically go around trees and other things while they circle it, unable to see you on the other side. 
---
She ripped his balls off, but no wonder she didn't rip off nothing considering it's a Dwight 
---
I personally wish it was just the carabiner belt
---
Just checked your comments on a whim and saw that you literally called somebody an attention whore when they didn’t deserve it so it actually makes wonder if perhaps you deserve some of those teabags. 
---
Never underestimate the /s
---
Nah there are legitimate issues with the game, as with any asymmetrical game.
---
Mama. Oooh. 
---
Didn’t mean to make you cry. 
---
While they do, they usually do it on someone they’re already chasing. Its not very often someone disengages from a chase just to pop T3 on someone with very little stalk juice left in them. Unless you’re right there, in which case, thats incredibly unlucky :p 
---
I kinda hope they don't completely work Freddy, I enjoy playing him as he is :(
---
Lmao 😂
---
the reason bbq and bitter murmur are useful, to me at least, is because i can see where people are going and cut them off. it's no use to me to see that there's a guy on a gen across the map from me when i could instead see where the people who just finished a gen are going. plus the auras can tell you if someones injured, if they've got urban evasion, etc. which the screams of rancor can't
---
That's all true, but Freddy is only strong at low ranks. While he can be VERY strong against new players, he is nearly unusable the moment purple, or even green, ranks hit. That's why a rework is more necessary than a buff. If they start pretty much from scratch, they could have a decent chance at balancing it correctly (unless they pull a Legion again).
---
It's already incredibly powerful?
---
Thank you for the details much appreciated!
---
Wow that’s amazing. Good job. Lots of detail in that. My fiancée wanted to cosplay her actually. Any tips?
---
Hmm.  Then why does a SWF group talk so much shit afterwards when they fucking destroy me?  I'm rank 12-13 killer, matched against like 4, 4, 14, 15, and they are like, "you're such shit.". Look I KNOW I'm shit, I'm trying to get better...  Why does this game balance entirely on numbers rather than developing an ELO system with which number of hours playing is a part of the ranking.  I played against a 2500 hour hag as a 150 hour survivor... How is this good?
---
you should level up David for WGLF, is easy to get more bloodpoints and level up other survivors
---
Dude that is so me irl rn
---
White trenchcoat Adam is something to behold too. 
---
well.....one thing that I can say &gt;&gt;  you are not fluent in English.
---
Is she half Nealander and half tarkattan now?
---
I dunno... good killers slug a lot. Especially nurses. 
---
I see.
---
Holy crap, I just saw the vest and immediately thought of Tapp for some reason, don't mind me.
---
You see, now Freddy has meter and he has to hit the survivors 3-4 times with dream demon before they fall asleep
---
I would want this in the game, but its too Bass and dramatic heavy, it doesn't have the sense of dread that most of the songs in the game they have,
---
But over all its actually very good,
---
if your capable of remixing it or changing it up make the drums and the orchestra more disturbing and turn them down a bit and you could have a potentially good chase theme.
---
&gt; I’ve been playing video games for 25 years + and I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a more toxic group  
---
  
---
_- Some person in every group ever_
---
Might as well just buy leatherface and get the damn perk.
---
What is the 95% T3 strategy?
---
Honestly it was really just the mask that gave me trouble, I'm not used to working with foam so I think worbla would have given it a better shape.  Everything else is pretty simple!
---
You haven't unlocked this character yet 
---
Rancor is actually really good for Mori dailies. Simply select the perk, and hard-tunnel the obsession without downing them the entire match until all 5 gens are done, instadown and Mori. Enjoy your bloodpoints.
---
Lebowski skin for Jeff when?
---
Looks like a Silent Hill monster
---
They talk about Freddy in every live stream. I’ve never seen a dev that lies to frequently
---
Ah so that’s why, I’ll give it a try it’s currently at level 1 but I’ll get it soon enough. Thanks for the quick response!
---
You both should of exited. Those butt dances at the exit gate costed you.
---
Overcharge, Unnerving Presence, Distressing, and BBQ and Chili. I don't have Huntress Lullaby or Ruin, (You can replace BBQ with a perk of your choice) but I love the bloodpoints and auras anyway and I don't want to bother with Hex perks that can get cleansed super quick. I considered Dying Light and a mori to kill the obsession but it's too much hassle for little payoff. 
---
I run both purple and yellow calm addons and a jigsaw piece. Or green electrode and iridescent king.
---
My man got some shoes finally.
---
XdxDxaDxdxdx 
---
I feel like Freddy's power could borrow a few tricks from Doktor, among them would be things like appearing to lag severely or working on illusory generators.
---
Haha. I've been recently getting back into DbD. And I swear when I play killer and I see Nea OR a Bill (yes a Bill. He owns my ass) I cry on the inside knowing I'm about to get rekt chasing someone I won't ever down. 
---
Noob3 is influencing more people to get better with Nea, perhaps. But I love it just the same. Hard chases, though a majority are quite embarrassing on my end, are still very fun. And I learn a lot from good survivors that inspire me to get better at survivor.
---
Tl;dr
---
I love this game and the community. Even if a survivor destroys my tunnelling ass.
---
It's not a part of the lore you can see ingame (yet). The devs just confirmed in a dev stream that the wraith and the nurse have a connection when answering a lore question if killers knew each other. I think they even told us that we will soon find out what they meant by that and these cosmetics make sense in that case.
---
In spite of everything you’ve done for them, eventually, they will hate you. 
---
I didn't really mind that I didn't escape because I still got my blood points.
---
I teabagged and was bm'ing him at the end for Face-Camping. 
---
This is why SWFs are generally hated by killers.  Unbalanced AND toxic?  Can't win or lose gracefully?  Sign me the fuck up!
---
hen the nea stalks you
---
I use Nurse's calling: you can see when survivors Snap Out of It with the perk. I also use  Distressing, Overcharge and any other perk (never hexes though cuz I consider them completely unnecessary on the doctor ) 
---
And iridescent King is great, the red stain really helps on cornfields . 
---
People are morons. I remember demolishing a team, they didn't get a single gen done. One guy said I was garbage because I missed one swing (this is console, frames ALWAYS drop when finding someone,hitting bloodlust... One guy literally looped me for half a gen and to him, it was 3. 
---
The hope being devored is not the survivor's, it seems
---
Wow, i searched it in hope it doesnt really exist, boy was i wrong
---
Even their mori animation shows that they aren't all thar strong survivors almost get away every time
---
Awesome!!! 
---
Just another quick question if you don’t mind. I’ve switched up to empathy / adrenaline / self care / urban, and wondering whether to swap empathy for balanced. I feel like empathy is great to see where the killer is while they’re chasing someone injured and helps do gens which avoid the killer. It’s currently my favourite perk so just wondering if you think I’ll have a problem running balanced instead.
---
I don't know what my favourite part is, vaulting the pallet from side to side, ducking to avoid the axe throw or hiding in plain sight. Outstanding!
---
Do you know how long they have to be hit by the flashlight? 
---
Holy fuck he got shoes for Valentine's Day? Entity really stepped up the gift game this year. 
---
Best feeling, gg
---
Then be a dick and tunnel play how you want
---
2017 is actually what I meant to type but my hands got bandersnatched.
---
Just plug that xbox controller into your pc. Happy days 
---
And this here folks, is a display of what we call the friend zone. 
---
Just a clarification, if the killer presses leave game at any point into the match, all survivors get the 5k escape points. However, if the killer actually loses connection and disconnects, survivors get nothing regardless of how many gens/gates were done.
---
And now kiss
---
So I should have let them go?
---
i’m so glad you did
---
I've been called a tunneler in 4K matches with 0 Gens done with Freddy at Rank 1... Like... I applied map pressure and 3 hooked everyone... how am I the bad player?
---
Is it? Usually its shards but like 20000 for a whole set
---
*^(personally I would rather not give killers an incentive to take people into and camp in the basement with MS)*
---
Haha yes funny meme
---
Prove Thyself is getting buffed so you should look at it again soon. 
---
Colour it
---
# red
---
if you had three in basement boy you bet im camping that place. you cant get banned for camping it just annoys people. imo as the killer you make the rules do what you want
---
You're welcome! Hope you enjoy your time playing DbD &lt;3
---
I would all so like to add they had no gens popped so I knew he would come or show me his location.
---
I don't know the exact amount, it's like  4 seconds IIRC
---
IMO Freddy doesn't need to be buffed. Every time I go against a Freddy I hate it because I always get owned and I've been to rank 1 a few times on pc. What is it exactly people want done to him?
---
Yeah, but when you get the goods like that, camping is honestly fair game.  Don't let others tell you otherwise.
---
i thought this was a cheeky joke about a popular ship or something at first but no, he literally did 
---
No, it's not camping. From the way you describe it, they were feeding to the hook. That's their fault for being too altruistic and it cost them.
---
Also, you can't be banned for camping. The devs have said it's a valid strategy, so you have nothing to worry about there.
---
Play the way you want and don't let a bunch of babies with made up rules dictate how you play or enjoy the game. If you had let them all go, they would have called you all kinds of names and bullied you. You got your kills, they're mad they didn't win. It's the nature of this game.
---
No
---
I genuinly want to know what you thought you would achieve by being a dick, but I guess there's more of that in your personality than in your pants, otherwise you'd've just acted like a normal human being
---
Let me tell you something. The missions were actually longer, and partially huge, like "Get 7 kills with the Huntress" and other multi-game missions which really were "daily", because they lasted long. I miss them
---
I guess then the Entity just likes seeing Freddy suffering and praying for a buff, that he never gets...
---
Bitch had her heart removed and sounds like she has 3 collapsed lungs she ain't gonna die for a long time if she's still moving now
---
Solo Q'ing is also affected, I've heard rumblings this is due to a lack of Killers currently playing on console which I can certainly believe, can hardly blame anyone for boycotting the game in its current state.   
---
Seems to be taking upwards of 15 - 20 mins before I can get into a lobby another 10 minute wait for the lobby to fill up. 
---
Im not arguing with you. Play how you want
---
Yes that‘s the thing, they get chased by the killer at the start of the game and as soon as they‘re downed, or miss their ds they leave even though we still have as much of a chance of winning
---
every single survivor has a knife to stab your shoulder
---
Yeah I know, started playing again recently after a long break and I don't have great perks, so this is what I ended up going with. Trying to get good stuff like self heal/sprint burst/decisive strike but for now this is what I'm running.
---
That is definitely what happened.
---
same, farming in DBD boring as hell.
---
not really an option given my current circumstances i have a wireless controller and cant really shell out the cash for an adapter at the moment. 
---
Yeah in pretty sure it's been on sale for almost a month now.
---
Got Freddy &amp; Cannibal during it. 
---
If you like empathy I would suggest leveling up Dwight for bond. I used to run empathy alot then I stopped using the perk moved on to try lots of different builds. Finally leveled up Dwight and level 3 bond is the shit. Bond gives lots of information, but best of all is no need to run self care. 
---
It wasnt added for a reason. The survivor ends up with no viable counterplay and justs hides extending the game
---
If it doesn’t go too fast maybe. I got banned on my old account after using a struggle / wiggle macro though.
---
Yeah it's been on for a while. I only saw it recently though and others may have missed it too so here's their chance I guess :)
---
r/woooosh 
---
Oh I already unlocked all killers when I started playing almost a year ago. I just fell in love with all the different killer playstyles and designs and thought it was awesome. 
---
Rebound it
---
Starting from Hallowed Blight you can, before that tho no. Exceptions are the Feng Phoenix shirt and black Huntress mask which were community event rewards
---
If i make the delay to 0.2-0.3 seconds should be okay
---
I just wanted to know what finna meant and got over 20 down votes. Hurts man
---
He's referring to past events which is true, that stuff is gone.
---
F... 
---
Well they’re not gonna be entirely gone though
---
Yikes. Bit much for a Wednesday afternoon 
---
Poor Dwight.
---
I mean I get what you mean, farming IS boring, but at the same time, the entire game is wasted if you and the survivors dont at least black pip, right?
---
That was awesome XD 
---
A question, does Claudette’s white shirt and green apron top count as “bright”? Because that’s the one I use and it doesn’t seem dark when I play. I haven’t played killer that much and I’ve never gone against a Claudette who was wearing it though, so I’m not sure from that perspective.
---
Rank doesn’t matter 
---
What program did you use?
---
I love the way it's animated. It looks really nice and smooth. Also congrats on getting plat.
---
I use a macro that is built into my mouse program. Logitech. No bans.
---
What is a "top tier player"? There is no such thing is this game. This game is too randomized to have definite top tier players. Also, just because someone you saw has it doesn't make it good. I've seen lot's of higher skilled playera run shit like dead hard, but that doesn't make dead hard better. Dead hard is just, in this context, more fun to use.
---
lol it's OK, I think we are all still there!!
---
Skinny Speedy Twink being empowered by a literal God
---
OPENED THE GATE AND WAITED TO ESCAPE IN CASE ANY OTHER SURVIVORS NEEDED HELP. I HAD A DAILY TO ESCAPE WITH A NEW ITEM (WHICH I HAD). WAITED AROUND FOR 5 MINUTES AS THEY DICKED AROUND WITH THE KILLER. THE KILLER D/C'D. BYE BYE DAILY. THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR BEING TOO ALTRUISTIC.
---
I mean, if the killer camped everyone and killed them based on being a dick, then the killer deserves it. 
---
Is the hoodied really blue?? Was gonna order the purple color, but yea awesome job in this!! &lt;3
---
Due to some errors with the software the video quality plummeted for some reason. (Very Sad) The gameplay ain't bad though.
---
Have you ever been in a situation where the killer has sloppery butcher and the other perk to see more lighter the blood trail and you are in a map such as The Game or Lery's memorial?
---
In that situation this can help a lot all you need is press the action button and walk away from where the killer is going, this will give to survivors the chance to evade the killer like urban evasion
---
I know its a joke but i dont think thats true. I think 1 overrides the other by that i mean the hit will activate your hurt burst thingy and you'll move faster then youll get the last few seconds of BL you have left if you do. But youll stay at 100% extra speed.
---
Then it should work also on Razer 
---
Lucky, I'm back to fighting those killer's where they hook you and just fucking sit there staring at you.  I'm not saying they aren't allowed because it's their de-pip but it's just annoying to not be able to play the game after getting hooked
---
Totally. So let's take the perk which is sprint burst locked behind a trigger effect which is locked behind the fall which you need the 1 hill across the map to proc.
---
If he did the killer would just look at him like dude I literally have a god on my side giving me inhuman powers what did you expect 
---
I've actually played quite a few games, and I'm getting ranked with 6-2 as both killer and survivor, but queues are like 30 minutes long.
---
Toxic Nea 2.0?
---
Nope The Legion like all other killers in the game is being empowered by the entity an actual god 
---
If you're teammates aren't doing gene and watching you die behind a rock nearby then they're worse than the camper.
---
A wee bit weak, but I like it! What about this?
---
Press the wound
---
When in the injured or dying state, activate the perk to not leave a blood trail on the ground for 6/8/10 seconds and remove the hemorrhage debuff. The perk has a cooldown of 50/40/30 seconds.
---
Gain 50/75/100% more bloodpoints for actions in the Survival category.
---
They were feeding you chaser points, I do this on both sides because it is only fair.
---
I did that with my proteus spectre but then I accidentally hit it during matches and it would a+d while trying to escape and it wouldn't let me cancel it. Is there a disable button?
---
They do for sure but this issue is an exception, a fix will probably be in the mid chapter patch. If not then that’s annoying.
---
Okay yes I see that it can be useful there, also the perk you're thinking of is 'bloodhound' from the Wraith, and I'm not saying I wouldn't try it.  I'm just saying there might be better perks for most situations.  Not hating on you by the way, just putting that out there
---
Me and the wife play SWF on the weekend when I'm not working and honestly haven't had more than a 2 minute wait, maybe its just because its two of us? But as killer its an instant fill lobby, so I'd say there's definitely a shortage of killers and honestly I can't blame them, scratch marks are shit, chase music is so obnoxiously loud that you can't hear survivor's. And two of the strongest killers(nurse and huntress) are barely viable on console due to the shit frame rate. As much fun as it is to be bullied by 4 mans using the games broken mechanics its understandable why theres so few killers now days on xbox.
---
Man, I love Freddy vs Jason.
---
That movie so stupid, and I love it.
---
Nah they werent I was standing still after like 3 mins of it then for the next 4 or 6 minutes they were just jumping over pallets constantly 
---

---
I'M ANGRY ABOUT SURVIVORS BEING TOO DAMN GOOD AT LOOPING BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME SINCE 2016 AND I ONLY JUST STARTED AND THEY TBAG YOU SO YOU CAMP THE FUCK OUT OF THEM THEN THEY HAVE THE AUDACITY TO CALL ME TOXIC WHEN THEY USE DS, INSTA HEAL, AND DEAD HARD LIKE CHAMPIONS. 
---
Thanks.
---
That would be great. My freddy would be rank 20 :)
---
you could just plug in a android chrager into the controller and play it like a wired controller. its what i used to do
---
Yup. Its.... odd.
---
Tunneling means “the survivors made bad saves”. It tilts me someone blames the killer for “tunneling” like is the killer supposed to waste time in a chase where he needs to hit the survivor twice? 
---
See the issue?
---
The Entity definitely plays favorites with their killers. Watching them suffer is all part of the fun. 
---
Nothing feels worse? Play killer in red ranks and watch as the broken game mechanics are abused against you making you realise how inadequate every killer except 2 maybe 3 are.
---
Legion. Incredibly frustrating to play as and against, and lacks counterplay in any way shape or form. Just poor design.
---
Tunneling is the fair opposite, rushing down one kill to never give the guy a chance, and in some cases to screw over the whole team.
---
I've been doing it for a while. My macro is just a recording of me mashing the button so the spaces are indistinguishable from me actually doing it. 
---
And how is the connection a heart?
---
Tunneling is a strategy to put someone out of game quickly. It is a strategy and not an objective 
---
Pretty sure Deliverance only works on your first hook. Probably because the second hook starts the struggle phase and you’ve missed your time to attempt to escape 
---
Well It's nice for a survivor but very broken for the killer specially if the survivor has urban evasion
---
I could imagine myself chasing one surv, I hit hima and after run near a corner he disappears
---
:0
---
Reminds me of Webber from Don't Starve with that mouth.
---
deliverance only works with your first hook. surprisingly it wont work if youre the last one alive though. idk if its a bug but i get skip all phases and die when im the last even though i have a confirmed unhook.
---
That’s what I was also thinking but because it lagged out, and I died, I wasn’t sure if I missed something while trying to struggle. Thank you 💖
---
Shitposting at its finest.
---
Lmfao, why would someone downvote my post for doing literaly nothing more than making a factual statement?
---
There wasn't even a personal opinion involved at all.
---
I don't even care about the downvote. I just think it's hilarious it got downvoted XD
---
Agreed 
---
Go for the injured. It's way more efficient. It's not your fault. It's your only objective to kill. They only dislike this because it actually makes playing survivor a challenge when the killer stops listening to every made up rule in existence 
---
Can someone explain this? Relatively new to the game.
---
I had Deliverance work once so far. And it was on my first hook. Kinda sucks that perk just stops being useful if you get hooked before anyone else. 😂
---
It’s definitely something they should fix, you should have a last escape attempt on the second hook, just Incase you have deliverance. And when you are the last survivor you should also have one escape attempt to use deliverance. 
---
dead hard
---
As a nea main. Thank you. I will take my scooby snacks now. 
---
One time in a match all survivors quit because of the serious FPS drop by this effect. But that was the first time I met a killer with this build. Now my console seems to have got used to it. 
---
Lithe :)
---
Both are rushing to complete your objective as quickly as possible, as the game becomes much more difficult and easy to pressure with only 3 survivors remaining. That, and sacrificing survivors is your main objective, tunneling is a very efficient way to sacrifice someone.
---
Sounds like a perfect game of sweet sweet justice 
---
Don't forget about enduring!
---
Okay this was actually brilliant. Like the characters match up and stuff
---
His traps were escapeable so they are fair. Are you talking about Jigsaw himself?
---
Dam🅱️
---
That freddy buffs meme was gold
---
When people say he's bad, it's in comparison to the other killers. 
---
Points
---
DO IT!! TAKE YOUR ANGER OUT ON THE FUTURE FUCKERS THAT DARE CROSS YOUR PATH! FUCK EM ALL UP, THE ENTITY COMMANDS IT! 
---
As it turns out the quality corrected itself, It's 1080p :)
---
I always wondered if Iron Will would help. So is calm spirit. 
---
I can hardly hear myself and when I am killer, the crows can’t really distinguish their sound when I’m patrolling.
---
Like honestly, Bill, David, Tapp could all easily just beat up legion. He’s just a wee lad
---
The lack of push-to-talk kills it for me
---
Yeah I agree. Don't let them go. The other survivors are dumb and they clearly should have gone for gens instead of their friend. It's a dick move, yes, but a dub is a dub. 
---
Sprint burst is good on all maps, dead hard is good only one time because the killer will know that you have it and balanced landing is godly on some maps but horrible on others. 
---
Happy cake day!
---
As a Wraith main, ":C"
---
i hate lowercase letters
---
generators cant be rushed because they have a set speed. Killing has not a set speed and it kinda can be rushed (moris etc)
---
Why does he need to?
---
Even if that was his mindset, why do you feel the need to 'call him out' for it? If that's how OP wanted to phrase him, who are you to belittle him for it?
---
Play Doctor, they DC half the time when see they can't hide anymore.
---
Is it xbox one S or above?
---
KILLER IRL!
---
There are times when they get 4k, but are playing in a very scummy way. I'll certainly applaud a killer for a well done match. For instance though, finding a survivor at the beginning of the match and facecamping them until they die is absolute garbage. IF you're SWF you can say "yo, this fool is facecamping, just do gens" but with randoms, they're probably all surrounding you waiting for a chance for those sweet bloodpoints. Both sides are in the wrong and nobody has a good time in that match. Getting 4k doesn't mean you were a good killer, also if everyone escapes it doesn't mean you were bad. There's just SOOO much more to it than people seem to notice. 
---
Some men just wanna watch the world burn.
---
this is fucking perfect
---
I use a g1 xbone controller. With USB plugged it. Works a charm
---
His rugby skills to destroy the killer probably.
---
You mean shadowborn?
---
The one with the giant tree in the center
---
Thank you! I think blue haired Susie's hoodie more purple!
---
I fuck with this heavy.
---
Am i missing something. I just get downvoted because i don't understand why we would get the same perk so soon.
---
Just rebind the key to one that does detect the keypress.
---
I've had multiple freddys who were chasing my friend while I was on the hook. I get saved, and freddy leaves the chase to go after me. That's a tunnel, and fucking WTF dude. Fully understand if you're not in chase, and you see the survivor going in for the save but to be in an active chase, drop it, just to have an ez down on the guy who was just rescued... that's scummy as fuck.
---
Yeha you're not arguing but you're being insulting
---
But then you realize they brang a tombstone piece instead so your good
---
But like 4 tougher survivors could beat them without powers.
---
Bill is a zombie surviving Vietnam veteran
---
Tapp is a trained policeman
---
Jake is a survivalist
---
David is an ex-rugby player turned thug
---
Balanced landing. Once you’ve learned how to use the perk effectively it’s easily the best of the 4 perks on most maps. 
---
Of course some maps like shelter woods have only one drop and it’s a little difficult to use but unless you get that map your set.
---
Yes
---
Iron will is a must. Always.
---
Killer will hear you grunt anytime otherwise.
---
Get out
---
its actually just a normal xbox one that ive had for a good few years
---
dead ard 
---
nice
---
Art.
---
yeah ive posted videos about this within the last week or two . im just lucky mine wasn't against a instadowner. 
---
i feel like that doesn't help as its happening game after game and what makes it even worse is all the "baby killer ez" bullshit in the endgame chat
---
I mean if I can make it back to the hook without losing momentum then fucking same. It's a potential 2 in dream and 1 on hook. That's 3 people not doing objective, but to drop a chase and go look for you, fuck that. I'm a Freddy I already waste 7 seconds to interact each time I'm not gonna drop a chase to go check every nook and cranny across the map
---
Bruh... the PTB patch notes stated in no uncertain terms that they fixed sloppy and the other addon that also caused this bug. It's not an issue they're unaware of, they've known AND fixed it. They are just shit about actually pushing through patches. Also, I get 23fps on pc in the ormond map no matter what. I really don't understand the problem with framerate.
---
Ill bet ya 10 bucks Wraith is watching. ya know, spirit world buddies!
---
Alright, that was pretty funny. 
---
Maybe they're looping the killer around the locker/ a mostly done gen you were on constantly and you can't actually leave. It's happened to me before.
---
Generators get rushed when the whole team is solely generator focused, just as if the killer is solely focused on killing one guy. Moris are something totally different but I can understand if you’re talking about mori’ing someone straight off the hook, which constitutes as tunneling. 
---
Just go all Object of Obsession and Sole Survivor, Empathy, Kindred, that would be cool. 
---
I went from PS4 to PC. Rebought all the DLC and never looked back. It just controls so much better and people are less sweaty. Plus PC isn't full of facecamping Wraiths, which is what I mostly seemed to face on PS4.
---
I can't see scratch marks as good as usual. If they change it that it lightens up, I would recommend it.
---
Yes, I forgot about Ardetha, but the ones I mentioned also helped me getting better at killer just a little bit.
---
Yeah but maybe not ten gens, the big issue is having it be balanced enough to be fun but also not impossible to apply pressure due to too many survivors
---
No joke though why is it always a dwight that fails the check 
---
"whens the last time youve seen sunlight ?" 
---
"its been 43 years"
---
There is nothing wrong with face camping when the gates are open. Why the fuck would you leave when you know the person will get away?
---
Now that I've become more experienced with survivor, I'm quite partial to Dead Hard. 
---
Just a nice perk to have. 
---
This is the exact reason why i picked Claudette. I dont want to loop people for 25 hours straight. I want to hide from the killer.
---
I play both equally so I don't end up becoming a one sided complainer like you. Me not being able to find videos isn't my being biased, it's the fact that it's not a thing that is possible. You are a genuine fucking moron, dude. I'm not paying you 100 dollars. You haven't proved anything. You are 100% wrong. I fear for any company you have any power in regarding networking if you don't understand how a Star topology is.
---
Stop going down this hole where you make shit up and put words in my mouth because you can't learn from your rant of a post and move on. It's pathetic.
---
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=survivor+lag+switching
---
Not a SINGLE video of a survivor lag switching. Just killers. That isn't bias, that's a fact. It is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A SURVIVOR TO LAG SWITCH WHEN THE KILLER IS THE HOST OF THE NETWORK. 
---
I have provided you with literal proof and reasoning as to why a survivor is incapable of lag switching. I couldn't take you seriously anymore after you said you think DBD is getting dedicated servers in order to fix survivors cheating.
---
How about unless you can find ME videos of survivors lag switching like you should have done in the first place, then you pay me 100 dollars? Because I have stacks of proof that Killers are capable of it and not survivors.
---
It’s supposed to be fun, not e sports level balanced
---
"[E] Stop Struggling"
---
Easy Satan
---
Optimal
---
that's not completly true. When you manage to get every perk on a survivor or killer there is a higher chance that those 2 nodes where the perks were, yield an ultra rare. don't know the percentages but it was around 2% or something.
---
Time to put on Sloppy Butcher
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/agju83/ojomos_valentine_outfit_render/ee7a630/
---
There's only one of them in a trial, and yes, seeing as how I bench 285, I'll take my chances with three other teammates against a shitkicker with a knife lol
---
I noticed a massive increase in dodging as soon as I put my P1 shirt on. It seems some killers don't want to face anyone who looks a bit untidy.

---
ummm, no... that's not true at all... it even says in the prestige description that it doesn't affect ultra rares
---
I think it gives you 5k + what you earned
---
Yes. It is still facecamping. Standing right there to avoid an unhook. Doesn’t matter how many people are left or if it’s “a legit strat” or whatever bs killer mains try to excuse it with. It has a name, and the name is “face camping”. 
---
As for your “even better question”, does it matter? Everyone knows that face camping is a toxic style of play, even with 3 other survivors still in the game. Seeing it outplayed by a lone survivor is gold, and even more gold because he rage quit when his shitty play style failed. This wouldn’t have happened had it been something like the Cannibal, who might as well have “face camp” as a perk setting by this point. 
---
Uh? A good anything is hard to play against?
---
There's an ongoing meme in the community that nea is a killer because of her scary face. OP was making a joke that even Michael Myers is afraid of stalking nea
---
Nea is one of the survivors that's great at long chases from the killer. And the killer usually won't stop chasing because at that point we've taken this chase personally so we continue to chase while gens get completed all around us. 
---
And then when the exit gates open, the Nea you've chased in bleeding mode for over 20mins, will let you get one last hit to down her at the exit and she crawls along the floor to freedom while you recover from your hit animation. 
---
Tl;Dr
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED AS AF
---
Should have ran, dont teabag
---
I've watched plenty of sports and have seen people crying and throwing tantrums on the field. Haha.
---
"Hidden"
---
i will tbag as much as my heart desires if the killer is camping
---
Dont need numbers when i have my eyes.. just become a above average Huntress player and youll see it yourself
---
Win+G and screenshot. You are welcome for the next time :)
---
if they are "gen rushing" and you know you cant get them all go for 1 kill. ive camped at 1 gen left because i knew it was just about to pop
---
Go chase someone else across the map from someone who is hooked? Still a dirty camper.
---
Could you imagine if every killer had an ability that also hurt them? Nurse blinks into a wall and gets stuck halfway in between. Huntress throws an axe and it bounces back and hits her in the head. Freddy gets his claws stuck in his wool sweater.
---
I didnt want it to end, i just nostalgiad all over my room.
---
balanced landing is the best perk in the game when you learn how to use it
---
Oof, I tried solo 1v1 once and got relentlessly killed by a Jill. 
---
At least they thanked you for the match tho!👍
---
This is actual gold thank you.

---
But... Eh fuck it. Im not gonna let you unhook the person i just hooked when you are right at the exit gates. Im just not gonna. I will look that person straight at their lifeless heart and smile as they get taken away into the sky. Why miss out on a kill when you just downed that person at the exit gate?
---
That clears it up quite a bit.
---
dont ya just love natural camoflauge? maybe there should be a bright map...
---
It’s somewhat fair. DBD isn’t even close. 
---
If this was for money like professional sports we’d only see sweaty 4 man SWF and camping and tunneling killers with a mori. 
---
Survivors get attacked with lethal weapons all the time i am sure they will take a hit to disarm the legion, david have a perk that reward him for shielding his teamates, also survivors use knives too. 
---
Although to be fair the legion (frank to be specific) seems to be skilled with knives so disarming them might not be an easy task.
---
I prefer being called toxic SWF trash while playing solo because I made one good save and we all got out.
---
I wouldn't mind Nea jumping at me like that. Maybe without the ripping out the liver part, tho
---
yes that has nothing to do with prestiging. it's because there are more nodes on the bloodwebs available for ultra rares spawning? plus 200 isn't really enough to solidify a *2%* increase
---
If I suspect an SWF, I'll dodge the lobby. The PTB changes haven't hit the live servers yet. 
---
I love you
---
DUDE WHAT GAME ARE THE IMAGES FROM IM DIEING 
---
When I'm a killer and have a bad game with less than 2 kills I give the survivors a 5 second leeway of teabagging and celebrating at the gate. They did good so I'll give them that. After that if they are sitting at the gate just teabagging waiting for me to hit them into the exit i just DC. I'll take the loss of the few blood points I got to ensure they dont get any
---
Definitely sprint burst. I laugh when people use dead hard... like nice. You delayed the inevitable for an extra 3 seconds. Balanced landing is too situational 
---
I don’t remember that piece of lore specifically but I’d argue the Entity only watches entertaining trials. Obviously they wouldn’t be excited to see every single one and the farm matches would just eye-blinded. Like the Entity probably gives the killers a good mind and body flaying afterwards but doesn’t vaporize everyone involved. 
---
Man I feel like I made like 8 of those
---
*BUT SOMEBODY TOOK THEM DOWN*
---
merciless killer indeed .....indeed ! 
---
We've been trying to tell everyone Nea is the hag for a year now.. 
---
YOULL BE SORRY WHEN I DOWN YOU PICK YOU UP AND STEP ON A TRAP TO FORCE YOU OUT 
---
New player with a question to this. Should the killer have walked away from the hooked survivor? If the gates were open and right there, wouldn't walking away basically guarantee that the survivor would be saved and both players would escape?
---
But surveillance is getting buffed...
---
He's got to find a window first.
---
"Killer is weak buffs pls bhvr is shit" 
---
He's cloaked in the background 
---
That was obvious exageration, but what part of it was salty to you? 
---
"I'M gAy" ruined it
---
Perfection 
---
Ah... the great apple and pear comparison I see
---
I guess you should have said "Why are some survivors so toxic?" instead. Original title makes it sound like you're clumping the whole survivor base together as toxic. 
---
My recommendation is balanced landing, iron will, technician, and bond/empathy/aftercare (aftercare imo is the best) really a "noob friendly build" 
---
I play both sides about as often as the other and as far as I've seen most killers and most survivors are decent folk. The bad ones are just more memorable.
---
CONGRA-FUCKING-LATIONS YOU WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE SOMEONE PLAYING MICHAEL FOR LITERALLY THEIR THIRD TIME AND HAD TO RUB IT IN AND SPAM GG EZ. WOW PEOPLE ARE SO OBNOXIOUS AFTER RANK RESET
---
Ahh, makes sense. I always tend to imagine the people with bad internet are lag switching or living in a third world country. Every ISP I’ve had has always hosed me for every dollar they can get, but at least I can play games at a reasonable quality 
---
It all comes down to placement. That short dash means nothing in the open, but if it gives just what you need to reach a pallet in time, you can extend a chase by quite a bit.
---
You mean... Ms PAINT? GADEM
---
Amazing art as always. \^\^
---
The same amount of toxic survivors exist as killers. If we assume half of all survivors and killers are toxic that means each on average killer match would pur them against 2 toxic survivors and 2 that aren't whilst a survivor match every other match would be a toxic killer.
---
Subverting the killer/survivor trope is fun in an ironic way to some people. You're the big scary guy carrying a weapon and trying to remove them from the match, but if you can't catch them, then they have all the power. People enjoy having power, especially when they're able to show off in front of friends. 
---
“When does a killer die? When he is hit by a decisive strike? No! When he suffers a nerf? No! When he plays against a team of SWF’s? No! A killer dies when he is forgotten!”
---
Dropping the pallet early on a huntress is acceptable in my eyes.
---
You should. If ya got 18K, 5K is added for an escape so 23K total.
---
But sometimes killers hard DC, so you don't get shit. No points and you can even lose your offerings and items. Something that exists for months now but nothing has been done about it. 
---
Nea shouldve been the scooby snack cause shes a snacc
---
I just want Nurses calling or Devour Hope PLEASE GAME 
---
There are many changes that have happened and more coming. One of the big ones is a healing nerf, it now takes 16 seconds to heal with a medkit or teammate, 32 with self care, and 20/40 normally/selfcare if you are mangled. Self care is still pretty common but is now less worth bringing because of the healing nerfs so if you want to drop it for something else then go ahead!
---
It’s supposed to be fair though
---
With that logic then whenever you finish a generator I could call it gen rushing then. Cause all I see in this video was someone attempting to secure a kill which is what basically majority killers, even myself, do after all gens are completed whether they killed 2 people or none at all. If you got them on a hook you're not gonna stroll away for them to be saved. You're gonna plant it and guard that body. Only time I'll say anyone walked away from a hook is if they have A: an instant down ability or B: NOED. Other than that protect and secure.
---
And yeah, kinda does matter. This community calls everything toxic now a days. Majority calling toxic is just survivors anyway over their own faults in a problem. Got to the point where I question if the word has meaning. But back to the point, like I said if he moved 3 feet and grabbed him off this post wouldn't have been here and/or replaced with another "punish face camping, fuck face campers" and blah blah blah. Only time I can agree that its toxic, and I use that word lightly, is when it's with an instant down ability combined with insideous while gens are still up to defend but at the same time it's always the simply solution of doing gens when someone's being camped. But what do i know, I'm just a killer main.

A new player that is smarter than a veteran player. Where have you been all my reddit life. 
---
HOW DOES THE KILLER KEEP HOMING IN ON ME EVEN WHEN I'M NOT SPRINTING OR HEALING AND HE HASN'T GOT ANY AURA PERKS??
---
4 FUCKING GAMES IN ROW I GET FOUND FIRST AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY HOUNDED ALL GAME BY THE KILLER
---
Karma? You knew they were SWF when you agreed to play with them. You knew you were going to camp them before the game started. 
---
Thanks for doing it! &lt;3
---
I have had multiple times where I am trying to fix a gen and I'll hear the prompt and never even see the skill check and just stutter to an explosion. I literally stop fixing gens now and strictly go for saves or chases and let others deal. It only happens on certain maps though. Lerys is one that is just unbearable. 
---
I wasn’t the killer lol
---
Just played a game as a hag. Completely demolished the team, but every survivor felt the need to t-bag after a pallet slam/whenever. No camping or tunneling. 
---
This happens every game I play as killer. Or unnecessary flashlights. But it's funny to see survivors trying to defend shit they know damn well goes on constantly lol
---
I wish more killers would do it. I think it's silly for anyone, killer or survivor, to just accept behavior like that. I'll be more than happy to make a SWF lose their offerings if they're acting like jackasses and I'm not in the mood for it. 
---
The quest probably wouldve gone a lot faster had i did haha.
---
Had a killer hard dc after his hex ruin was cleansed after 1 minute...no bloodpoints and lost item as well..
---
And here I thought that was a brain...
---
A new game mode for sure needs to happen that is for sure! Be it a story single player or what ever
---
I’m saying if their excuse for camping was “you’re SWF, it’s karma” and they were running BBQ and still didn’t leave.

Yupp, when they fuck around like that I hard DC. I don't give af about bps I got all the perks anyway
---
OOF
---
AFTER THE RANK RESET MY SKILL ALSO RESET.  HOW THE HELL CAN I NOT SEEM TO DO WELL WITH CHARACTERS I'VE PLAYED A TON, BUT I CAN 4K ON FREDDY WITH NO PERKS.  UNACCEPTABLE!!!
---
[deleted]
---
I hope he won't be changed too much i like the way he is.
---
Just a small buff like having survivors that are falling sleep not being able to heal or finish gens.
---
Prolly some of the new legion perks
---
Yeah and a doctor that's trying to shock you around the loop. 
---
Lol, I love how he stands there and lets you unhook instead of actually hitting you and getting you downed instead. 
---
Sure, and I'd play Myers over Nurse. I think he's more fun to play, and I'm not great at timing blinks anyway. I still think that a skilled nurse will beat a skilled Myers, on average. 
---
I doubt it’ll die, too many people are too invested in the game for it to lose following even in a span of 2 months. I do agree though performance on console and 2.4.0 balance changes have likely been a major contributor to a lack of killers lately
---
Charge your chainsaw as they approach a pallet and instantly destroy it. The only thing bill struggles with are windows. If you're that worried run spirit fury. I played a Billy last night with it and it was pretty successful for chases.
---
I’ll take your word for it. I do play killer but not at red ranks. I don’t play enough for that as a survivor main. 
---
It be like that but I don't agree with it. 
---
I said what I said. 
---
He doesn’t need ruin honestly.
---
I also love to play as him, he's so unique. I hope those changes come soon.
---
No... It's not really their fault the guy DC'd. If somebody DC's, I usually just let the rest escape. I understand that it's extremely frustrating to have your game ruined because some guy DC'd.
---
yur beeng a big fat meenee! (I thought about saying “what’s an Ojomo,” but I mean I guess in a way it educates people, Billy’s real name is Max by the way, but no one cares...)
---
Or that doesn't need to be an opption in the game. 
---
Thing is if you charge your chainsaw then they won’t throw the pallet down.
---
Wait do huntress mains lag switch alot or something?
---
Same, must be because of the coat and the jeans.
---
Didnt they update match making that dumps 3 or 4 people at the same time regardless if they are swf or not. Theres not really a way to tell anymore who is swf.
---
He doesn’t need ruin you clown. He has connection in his side. He’s like huntress, he doesn’t need to actually hit you for it to count as a down. He’s the 2nd best killer in the game. Stop whining. 
---
That’s cool of you - I wasn’t the killer, I was part of the SWF and the killer camped us at hooks and said it was our karma for being SWF 
---
/Onyx needs a new ISP/
---
I don’t think they did that on console yet 
---
DEVS. PLEASE MAKE IT SO DBD IS ACCESSED THROUGH A BEHAVIOUR ACCOUNT. THIS GAME IS TRASH AND DEAD ON PS4. I HAVE IT ON PC TOO, BUT ALL MY DLC AND SURVIVORS AND PAID COSMETICS ARE ON PS4. IF FORNITE CAN DO IT, WHY CANT U
---
It’s not camping. 
---
Even if it was, it’s a legit strategy against which a few players chose to whine and cry instead of profiting from it. 
---
Don’t let the loud minority harass you and ignore those comments. That’s why I love console gaming. 
---
Had a game against 3 SWF and 1 random. The SWF had flashlights and DS. I'd down one and get swarmed by the other 2 who proceeded to flashlight buzz and try to draw me away. Eventually slugged the 3 of them. Don't think the SWF ever touched a gen. The random got hatch. They called out the random for not doing gens. Flashlights bring out the stupid. 
---
The killer should walk away slightly and circle close to the hook in this situation, because you have a better chance of killing one of them if you hit the unhooker once and can blade wipe before they finish the unhook animation.
---
That said, Legion has a really, really hard time securing a kill next to an open gate without NOED.
---
Only if you leave match. If you DC they dont get any. Just turn you ps off or unplug internet. Screw it. People wanna act like they will lose everything 
---
Don’t get found
---
Well shit time for me to say an unpopular opinion. There are arguably better perks for Billy than Ruin. Sloppy Butcher, thats one. Pop Goes the Weasel: thats another. You get rewarded for hooking, then you Concorde your ass to a gen and wreck it. Enduring: don't respect pallets. Spirit Fury (I think its called): destroy the pallet when stunned
---
Ruin? Gets destroyed in less than a minute b/c shitty RNG. Good survivors know how to hit red skill checks (its not that hard), etc. etc.
---
&gt; Billy isn't nurse.
---
No shit. Nurse ignores game mechanics. But Billy has 10 times better map pressure than Nurse. Plus an instadown. And his skill cap ain't that bad. Really, it isn't...just get better and use perks thats gonna help you for most of the game and not just for the first 2 minutes (cough cough Ruin)
---
&gt; Doesn’t matter how many people are left or if it’s “a legit strat” or whatever bs killer mains try to excuse it with
---
I’ll make sure to wander away and let you get the free escape next time. There’s one person left in the game and one person hooked with the gates open right next to them, this is one of the only times it’s not toxic play. If this killer had a competent bone in his body he would’ve gotten the grab or at the very least gotten the guy back down. 
---
umm dead hard helps a ton to get to a pallet/vault when you have little distance between you and killer
---
I can’t wait. We get lobby dodged so much. 
---
DBD 2019 Trailer
---
I'm not arguing that it should be easier for Hillbilly to prevent loops, I'm saying that that the Hillbilly still struggles with pallets like most killers.
---
&gt; Noob3 is influencing more people to get better with Nea,
---
um.. survivors are more or less interchangeable especially once you unlock meta teachable.  If you're good with Jake, Meg or Feng you're going to be good with Nea. If anything he should be influencing his fanbase to stop being a bunch of biased toxic shitlords. 
---
How dare you speak this way about Dwight.
---
Finally, a good fucking meme. Thank you
---
I don't understand why everyone says Freddy is so terrible. Except for one match that I can remember, he always owns whenever I am matched against him. And I survive against other killers well enough (including Nurse and Billy).
---
In my experience people choose Claudette because they just don’t have any idea what to do in a chase. 
---
Ree hee hee hee!
---
Well now you're being sarcastic, so you're proving my point.
---
As a killer main, I'm telling you, dead hard is the weakest of the exhaustion perks, including lithe. Every killer main I know will down you within 10 seconds of someone using dead hard. 
---
It came with PS4 premium, so 'kinda' free and they get hag and doc. But that's hardly the main complaint.
---
I've gotten very freaking good at landing tomahawks, but the shitshack loop is seemingly impossible to break with her. She is just too slow, and you cannot hit a hatchet as they will always be around the corner or through the window before you can wind them up.
---
As a killer i hate this map, as a survivor i love this map.
---
I am in dedication level 3 in just 3 months. This game is great. 
---
I've been sarcastic this entire post. How does that prove your point, which is now vastly different from your original comment on this post? 
---
Stay on track buddy. Focus. 
---
Sprint is good because you always get use out of it, even though people knock it for forcing you to walk everywhere, I like using it to zip between gens.
---
Balanced has pretty strict requirements, which means it's very hard to accidentally waste it, but it's entirely possible to find yourself too far from a drop to use it.
---
Dead Hard is my favorite, and I think the most fun exhaustion perk, but there's no denying that it doesn't get you the same distance the others do. If you can pull a clutch Dead Hard, though, it can be extremely powerful.
---
Lithe is too easy to waste while looping, and I consider it the worst of the 4, only really good in the Lithe+Dance With Me combo.
---
Leave Nea alone you big meanie
---
Ah,I see now why you left our the "perhaps" in my OP
---
Wasn't stating a fact or anything. Just an opinion. Perhaps.

Good shitpost
---
Complaining about something that you couldn't POSSIBLY have known was going to bite you in the ass years later in the first month of release. Yeah, that makes sense.
---
Killers that camp and tunnels goes on constantly too. Both sides have toxic players and both sides have non toxic players. If you mainly play killer then you're obviously going to encounter more toxic survivors than you do killers (for obvious reasons).
---
Just wait until you unlock Urban Evasion. If hiding is your playstyle, you're going to love it.
---
Maybe finishing the gens powers 4 escape pods at each of the boat go into the escape pod section (you don't have to interact with escape pod to escape)
---
THINK BEFORE YOU UNHOOK SOMEONE FFS
---
Freddy without decreased transitions add-ons in a nutshell
---
As you can see in the video, the hook was close enough to the exit gate that after a hit, that the survivor being hit could literally run out with the speed boost. The only way for Legion to catch them would *maybe* be with Frenzy, but that doesn't allow you to down survivors so it doesn't help them in this case.
---
The Legion played bad, and they were an idiot for disconnecting, but their play style was not toxic in this specific situation. There was literally no way for them to get anything more out of that game unless the Nea made a mistake, which they did, the Legion just failed to capitalise on it.
---
happy cake day!!
---
Grab usb plug it in 👍
---
This makes my whole head hurt. 
---
&gt; Survivors are supposed to do gens. That’s how the game works. 
---
And the killer is supposed to get kills. That’s how the game works. 
---
&gt; The killer has abilities that allow them to CHASE survivors, especially Legion with his speed.
---
Besides the fact that legions ability in non lethal without going into frenzy multiple times, there’s no chase to be had here. The gates are open right behind the hook which as you can see means any hit is going to push a survivor to the gates after being hit. 
---
&gt; You see someone trying to secure a kill, I see a twat who can’t stand losing.
---
I mean, what? How would you like a killer to play this situation out. Wander around the map praying they run into the last urban evading survivor, let them get the unhook and walk out the gates without a challenge. If there’s one person left, gates are open behind the hook and I don’t see your ass with BBQ, I’m parking my ass around that hook and at the very least making you trade the hook. At the very least I’m going to bait the unhook and put the guy back down before he gets out. 
---
&gt; But in situations like above, where it’s ONE survivor left, face-camping is overkill
---
How? Tell me what the killer is supposed to do
---
&gt; By placing himself there, he was trying to rob both survivors of their game by using a zero skill tactic, and when it’s 1v1, and the remaining survivor has no flashlight or defense? Yeah, it’s uncalled for, over the top.
---
He already downed someone and hooked them, therefore had some skilled play (though with legion probably not so skilled but that’s the game). I don’t even know how to tell you how dumb the end of this point is though. It’s not 1v1. It’s 1v2 with one hooked. And the survivor that isn’t hooked doesn’t need any defense because they’re full health with the exit gates close enough that taking a hit will allow them to run out. 
---
&gt; Face camping is done by killers who care less about git’n gud and downing other survivors and more about cheap tactics that shouldn’t be in the game to begin with
---
I’d agree if he was face camping all game. But in this context you just sound dumb
---
&gt; Again, he could have EASILY pulled the other survivor off the unhook. It takes ZERO skill to do that, but had he managed it, he would have been rewarded for doing essentially nothing but standing stock still.
---
He would’ve been rewarded for the survivor being stupid as fuck. If you go for the unhook in this situation and you get killed for it instead of just escaping, that’s on you. If you go for it while a killer is camping and gens are still up, the killer may be trash but you should be doing gens to punish that. 
---
\*Hides in locker\*
---
But are you getting dodged because the other members are SWF?
---
Its PS4, also I wasn't the one playing.
---
No shit, but like I said with your logic I can use that argument. And glad to see you know what killers and survivors are supposed to do during the majority of the game. That all changes at the end. Legion speed of 110 is not going to help him, and his extra speed for feral frenzy really wont help help cause guess what? 4 swipes, 3 with Frank's, is what its gonna take. And that "twat" was doing what any other killer would do end game. Cause I know, or atleast I'd hope, you wouldnt be dumb enough to leave a person on a hook, next to a opened gate and think "well gosh I better find the last guy before he escape. This survivor will be just fine on the hook away from my presence with the gate behind him, completely open to anyone"
---
And your facecamping at end game is literally called securing a kill for a obvious reason, especially in the situation he's in. It's not form of overkill. Overkill if you're part of the spoon feed me wins group sure. And how is that robbing someone of a win? Technically then you robbed him of a win (knowing the emblem system he probably would've popped if he didnt dc). And tho its zero skill, most survivors be feeding to it so who's more at fault there? And correction, it's when it's a 1v2. 1v1 means you and the killer which you would win anyway cause hatch. But back to the point it's still not over the top, hes doing his job, and the other survivor made a high risk/high reward call. Doesnt matter if he had the perks/items to do it or not. It doesnt make it anywhere close over the top.
---
Killers with op abilities? Like who? Cause legion is far from it, trapper got nothing, hag is laughable, myers is hit or miss, pig is basically again laughable, everyone that isnt hillbilly or cannabal cant do jack squat shit in this situation so I dont think you got much room to talk about OP abilities. Facecamping is done when killers cant "git gud" sure. But tie it to this situation. This isnt a git gud situation this is (and I'm sounding like a broken record) a secure a kill situation.  If he pulled the savior off the hook guess who's fault it would've been? Cause it sure wouldnt have been the legion.
---
So instead of doing math, use some logical thinking. math is easy but it seems common sense in situations is harder for people to grasp. If a killer is securing a kill it's not face camping, just like if you get pulled off the hook in front of a killer that's not tunneling. But once again what do I know. Taking a person off the hook isnt skill, looping a killer for a period of time is skill. Major difference between the two to show what a person should be more proud of in terms if "skill". But what do i know, I'm a killer main.
---
I mean if you ignore the powers the entity gives killers and all that even Dwight could beat the shit out of the two female legion characters, they’re like 17
---
This. Why cant people grasp this thought. 
---
First I need to get her to BBQ 3 and pick up whatever junk I get offered along the way - but yeah, leveling other killers was sort of the plan - just takes a while. Not just for teachables, I kind of switch around who I play as every now and then anyway, gets boring otherwise.
---
Guess I can still play around with the BH slot if I get something juiciy-looking, although I still think it's a, maybe not top tier, but actually pretty damn good perk on her, you know *exactly* where they are, while mediocre for other killers. Bit map-dependent since on dark maps (Haddonfield in particular), it (literally) really shines, on The Game you probably don't care.
---
Thanks for your advice! :)

Clip?

You can also activate it on the rock by the tree or at basement stairs while looping the shack. 
---
Because of SWF.
---
I never play differently because of DCs
---
I think you mean BFA
---
Because they did a pretty good job so far.
---
They tend to lack lethality. Their ability is good for injuring survivors but they struggle to down survivors effectively
---
This so much. Absolutely amazed by how much easier it is to track an injured survivor by sound alone or pick up the faint heartbeat meaning you're on the edge of the killer's TR.
---
https://youtu.be/jqzBaPOnwtQ
---
play a game against/with him instead of posting on reddit and you'll see why. games with legion in it last forever and are mad boring.
---
I played a game as killer the other day. Not one survivor tbagged.
---
Your anecdotal evidence is just as valid as mine.
---
you played *a game* the *other day*. 
---
nice example. 
---
TFW I always lunge at survivors... Woops,
---
Becouse he is extremly boring and unfun to play as and against. Basically you just spam your m2 until you down survivor and even if you miss the swing you dont have any cooldown so legion will stab you no matter what. There is no counterplay to him and people who says "just hide",  "just pallet stun him" are just stupid. Most legions respect pallets so you wont stun him unless he is dumb and you cant hide against him cuz he can see other survivors aura or something like that i dont know how to call it when he stab you. So yea. Pretty good job BHVR. I can see those downvotes from legion mains but i dont care.
---
It's more the fact that in a game where survivors are just skins she's clearly the strongest.
---
Closest I've gotten is escaping a rank 6 match with No Mither :/
---
&gt;King Crimson has already forseen your hope!
---
Omg ur just sO random xd
---
THIS LITERALLY HAPPENS TO EVERYONE BUT ME. 
---
No Mither, Self Care, Object of Obsession
---
2 reasons. 
---
A. (The most likely scenario) they haven’t played enough killer to understand these situations from their perspective 
---
B. They’re delusional enough to believe killers should follow some unwritten rules to allow survivors to play optimally. 
---
I don't know if I'd go quite so far as to say they consider camping a valid strategy, since they intentionally make you lose points for it, but they certainly don't consider it cheating.
---
This may be irrelevant but I just realised how good a song the scooby-doo opening is like wow this kinda bangs 
---
This game is made for sound. When I’m playing killer I play spirit, bop them once then follow the scratch marks in spirit mode. You can always tell where they are through sound. 
---
Even silly little things like hearing billy rev his chainsaw, you can tell where it is and where it’s going from across the map. 
---
As a killer recently I was looking for a last survivor, only found him because he cleansed a dull totem near to where I was and the noise of the bones hitting the floor led me straight to him. 
---
Even if you just use normal earphones I definitely recommend something like that. Helps loads. 
---
I find it very good in Lery's, even though you can only activate it in the middle
---
Can't destroy someone, whos strength comes from supernatural
---
He’s right according to everyone else. Leader will give 25% faster action speed to everyone in the 8 meter range for actions that aren’t generator repairs. I.e. totem clearing, opening gates, healing
---
Because what’s the point of killing one survivor? You already lost. 
---
I'm certain a handful of killer mains are representative of the entire DbD population, just like a handful of survivor mains are representative of the entire DbD population when they say a majority killer mains are toxic, right?
---
Bingo
---
The ritual is broken. The only coop action that counts is when you heal someone with someone else, which can be rare, causing you to spend a lot of time on this ritual
---
It would have been better if the behavior claw thing was actually the hag. Still pretty good vid tho
---
To get more blood points? To do the killers objective? 
---
What’s the point of stopping the killer from getting one kill? You already won!
---
A R T 
---
Level up Dwight. No reason to buy a perk for a character you don't have to spend money or shards for.
---
Can confirm, am hooked from Freddy Buffs while my team tea bags in the basement. 
---
Lmao I sincerely doubt plenty of survivor mains would agree that killers are toxic. 
---
Because a toxic killer makes the game unenjoyable and almost unplayable. Camping and tunneling make this game complete trash, and if the majority of killers did that, then no one would play as a survivor. 
---
Think harder when you're trying to argue. 
---
Did you really need to stamp your name on to something that anyone could recreate in 5 minutes or less? 
---
To be fair the music can often sound just like a heartbeat 
---
Oh damn, no idea how I didn't see this. Thank you
---
It's allright, no offense taken, no reason to insult yourself.

Something to do with creating artificial input lag that makes the timing easier, iirc.

---
Maybe give the killer bonus BP if SWF are in the game, like:
---
2 SWF - +5%
---
2x2 SWF or 3 SWF - +10%
---
4 SWF - +15%
---
I'd be awkward not to go overboard with BP, while still keeping an incentive but something like that.
---
I strongly suggest you watch some good survivor streamers who use dead hard. It’s the most popular exhaustion perk for a reason when you have people who know how to use it properly. 
---
People who are good also don’t usually use sprint burst because of the time wasted on walking around the map.
---
Freddy is easily my favorite killer to play, but there are some glaring issues with him that just prevent me from considering him to he a top tier killer. First off, he has to wait seven seconds from the time he sees a survivor to begin a chase. No other killer has to wait to attack his prey. Sure, he doesn't have a terror radius, but neither do killers like The Pig and The Wraith. Freddy can't stop people from opening exit doors either. In the time it takes to fall asleep, odds are the door can be activated and the survivor escapes (unless you are running remember me). If Billy or Myers see someone on the panel, that player isn't getting an easy escape. 
---
His mobility is also fairly limited. Freddy can be looped quite easily, especially when you consider survivors effectively have a 7 second head start.
---
His aura reading is fantastic, I don't diminish that, and for survivors who aren't prepared for it is devastating. However, countering it is as simple as failing a skill check. Survivors with a med kit or self care easily exit the dream world by doing something they would have wanted to do *anyway*. If The Pig downs you, you're now gonna have to deal with a RBT and an additional victory requirement, slowing you down significantly. Arguably, that does a lot more to slow down the game than the action speed penalty from being in the dream world.
---
Now, it's not fair to just compare Freddy to other killers, but pretty much every part of his kit is done better by another killer. Freddy requires a different approach than other killers will, which is why he tends to destroy teams that normally don't see him, but his actual kit isn't very strong, and can be outplayed by survivors who are familiar with his abilities. 
---
Isnt he more well known as Shane from TWD?
---
Man the first time I ever did this the camera was shaking through the entirety. GJ on staying calm XD
---
&gt;Also, why can't I stay in a party with my friends instead of having to invite them every time? 
---
Because the instant you join a Killer lobby your a solo player. There can be only one lobby, one host, and that's the Killer. So SWF lobbies are disbanded as soon as they're paired with a Killer.

Just saying based on the amount of people complaining Freddy is broke he shouldn't be hard ever if actually broken. 
---
thanks a lot, cunt bot.
---
How do you know who the obsession is, except for when they're briefly highlighted on gen completion?
---
Clearly taking away 2 pips doesn't do anything
---
LOL get it cuz nea's a killer? LOL XD

Yes, Source Filmmaker and Photoshop. Thx.
---
No, I mean like, rank progress, as in it takes longer to rank up 
---
Nobody answered my question
---
You have angered the cry-babies. 
---
That is fucking disgusting, like next level traumatic to watch
---
You can do what the the other guy said to bait the unhook but if you’re in the slightest bit competent (this guy clearly wasn’t) facecamping is going to secure you a kill. You can either get the grab, make sure you hit the guy off hook or hit the savior before they unhook and make them trade their life for the save. All of which are perfectly fine 
---
He’s waiting to try and hit the Adam 
---
agreed.
---
And if you DC again during a 24hour span, the next Penalty is doubled
---
How does that make any sense?
---
Kiddy?
---
I PLAYED WITH MY FRIEND LAST NIGHT AS SURVIVOR BUT HE COMPLAINS A LOT ABOUT BEING TUNNELLED EVEN THOUGH IN REALITY HE IS JUST A BITCH
---
Try using the purple add one "plaid flannel" for 1 match
---
I don’t play nurse but I believe she has an add on that tells you. Not 100% tho if it’s still a thing or how rare
---
I’m pretty sure he was attempting to hit the rescued survivor back down, but the auto aim made him hit the rescuer instead. 
---
It can explain why some situations like using Insidious or EW1 Myers happen. Insidious most likely cuts the connection with the Entity, therefore no stain or terror radius. Myers probably just tells the Entity “fuck you” and severs the connection himself. Makes sense especially with the Entity-defying feats Myers can do.
---
&gt; The same amount of toxic survivors exist as killers.
---
Based on what?
---
It's top tier compared to 90% of perks, but when comparing it to sprint burst it's just inferior
---
This is the kind of affirmation action I need from the gaming world. I feel like mcote acknowledges it with as purposeful as the diversity is in dbd.  
---
I like him. He doesn’t always get kills but he is great for points. He’s basically a chase machine which is the fun part of the game. It’s gonna be tricky to find that happy medium cuz if they buff him he could easily become nurse tier but if they don’t he is bottom tier. 
---
Impossible Skillchecks Build😤
---
I primarily run lithe but I would go for DH as a secondary
---
Looks gorgeous.
---
[This match] (https://youtu.be/LHhOb222oKI) would have ended in a 2k, minimum, if not a 3k if it had been **any** Killer other than Freddy.
---
Haha thats great
---
This brings a tear to my eye 
---
I’ve never been sent a dm from a killer after match. Survivors I get at least one a day. 
---

Surely this is a clown add-on and not that Franklin's applies to bottles, right? (I hardly ever come across Clowns.)
---
Holy shit this is so good what the hell why is it 10 times more banging than the official chase music. BHVR hire this man
---
definitely balanced, but i don't think anyone would run that. something more useful, IMO, would be this:
---
&gt;Like A Feather
---
&gt;Becomes available while in a Chase. When activated, you do not leave scratchmarks for 3/4/5 seconds. You become Exhausted for 60/50/40 seconds afterwards.
---
&gt;"It's not enough to have the feathers, you must dare to fly."
---
I think they accidentally broke it with the Legion release patch, but they know and will fix it soon.
---
OG mathafuckaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
---
Theres no reason you couldnt have known. There arent any hidden stats, all the perks are cleary explained. Just because you cant figure out what perks are good doesnt mean the game should be changed in your favor 
---
Ok pal. You clearly don’t understand the game so there’s no point anymore. 
---
Next on DBD: Players complain about buggy storymode.
---
Seriously though. If they do make a story mode, I hope that it isn't full of bugs. It's fun in MP, but it'd suck to experience them in SP.
---
Make an animation like this, but it's the clown mori animation
---
This is fucking art. I love it so much!

why would you patrol? if the exit gates are open there's literally no reason to leave the hooked survivor

Wah

Found it on google images. Sorry for the quality
---
50fps WAS objectively the best possible FPS for survs BEFORE the engine update.
---
I showed it to my brother and he goes “ahhh how I miss farcry” I was like what the fuck dude he was like “what” I was like where did that come from, he says that’s the crosshairs for farcry. And then we got in an argument, now we’re here.

Oh they’re not the smart oh the killers camping let’s gen rush kinda survivors
---
Can anyone tell me Freddy’s upcoming changes? 
---
And you clearly play the game to be a troll. So there’s no use talking to you. 
---
Its practically impossible.  If he uses his power, he automatically can't get it due to the Deep wounds taking priority over a down, and if he follows normally, he is a 110% move speed killer who would likely have to go through a bodyblock as well.
---
Began sketching Bunny Feng at Uni, since I was bored. Just finished the outlines and decided to upload it...Devs, I'm still waiting for that skin, it's an instabuy. Come on ;; 
---
Should I color it? 
---
I don't care if survs are swf or not, I treat each surv as an individual.
---
lol they deleted their comment
---
Oh, for some reason I didn't think you were talking about the crosshairs and I honestly have no idea why I thought that but yeah those crosshairs are from Skyrim, not farcry
---
God I love the gas mask so much but this is beautiful
---
Happy cake day!!
---
oh heck yes
---
Look at DbD's Steam chart....then look at F13's. 
---
Enough said.
---
Maybe its just because of her being licensed. 
---
But i wouldve loved to see her with a boar mask and her squeak bein much lower or so
---
Friendly BM is fucking hilarious, just a lot of people just see it as "I hope you die irl" or something like that, idk, people are sensitive little bitches when it comes to objectively non-offensive things 
---
What was it?

Yo the same thing happened to me. But as doc
---
Checking accounts come with a debit card, which can be used on Steam and Epic stores.

Debit Card is basically a Credit Card that uses money from a checking account. Let's you pay cash for things online pretty much.
---
speciest. Poor shadow monster men dont get enough attention
---
One of the best post 
---
Obviously not??? What type of question is this LOL
---
Killer is instant matches for me Everytime. Exact opposite of pc
---
Maybe because they dont have so many players. When they get above a certain amount they might starting doing the same. Companies. Its just their way of moneymaking.
---
What's bm stand for
---
I wish survivors had access to the seperation offering and the killer had access to the offering that makes all survivors spawn together. Another offeeing I think wouldn't unbalance the game is one that forces 1 survivor to spawn next to the killer. This might sound unfair, but think about it, would you rather spawn next to the killer or have the killer run an ebony mori?
---
That would be pay to win and it runs games
---
! I’ve been wondering why i only would get a couple seconds. Thanks. 
---
Ya i was going for that but wanted to shitpost more.....
---
At least she’s the hardest survivor to get found. It’s kind of nonsense, but it’s definite true.
---
I believe devs said they're all above 18.
---
Depiping a dc killer will make things worse. He will easily kills survivors at weaker ranks and regain his rank easily.
---

The ending really sold it for me. Nice job.
---
Hahahahaha. God forbid.  Killer mains are so entitled and such crybabies Jesus 
---
When I started playing I used the exact same build, but I replaced urban evasion with Iron will. It's much better for losing the killer in a chase. Sound is very important for killers so using iron will helps you easily lose the killer if you know how to break line of sight and stay out of it 
---
Lmao, i usually play with only my one friend, which means we still got to get one other dude. There’s been so many times we had the perfect chance to get like 5seconda towards but the dumbass runs away towards the killer. I’m at 173s 🙃

I have a debit card for my savings account at my bank, but It dosen't let me use it online, like anywhere. there isn't even an option for debit card in any online service that I've seen. It's all credit card, or paypal.
---
shes mediocre, not the worst killer just at top tier everyone that's not nurse or maybe hillbilly is irrelevant
---
Because it’s broken a quest that should take like 10 minutes takes like TONS of matches 🙃
---
Hag can be a strong killer if you know what you're doing, I wouldn't put her at low tier at all.
---
What did you get me?
---
Another top tier edit that deserves to be at the top of the sub.
---
Nice of you to neglect the shit talk that warranted that response. If reddit hurts your feelz, best to take a break. 
---
Woah, yeah. Whoever said that the Hag is pretty bad probably doesn't know how to play her correctly. She's not the best killer, but she's up there. She's probably one of the hardest ones to play, but if you watch Hag mains, you can see what she really does. That's funny because I thought that the consensus was that she was a top 5/top 6 killer at least. 
---
This is amazing. My only comment is that you should’ve put leatherface when the gang huddled up in the middle.
---
Frank's is really powerful, but it's also boring to use because of how easy winning becomes with it. 
---
lmao thanks 
---
Right because [Argumentum ad populim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) totally isn't a fallacy and is a logical course of thinking!
---
np bud
---
Nice you looked almost exactly like her. Especially the hoodie it looks so cool
---
I don't think Huntress or Spirit is irrelevant, either. They're pretty great killers. Even clown I would say is relevant...although, I don't even know what you mean by relevancy, so your definition of it may actually apply.
---
Davis is such a Chad
---
A purple flashlight with an odd bulb add-on? Maybe a purple toolbox with a brand-new part? 
---
Fucking lmao 
---
Are these older videos you're seeing about the hag? There was a time where she was considered lower tier, but then she was buffed within say the last 6 months or so and now most people see her as being one of the better killers. 
---
I’d pay for this to be the intro, none of that spooky shit
---
Hag plays very differently than the other killers. That's why your average "I chase surv and m1 them" that picks up hag and tries to play her the same way isn't very successful with her.
---
A little bit like trapper she's more a strategic killer that needs some setting up. It's not too bad to loose 1 gen of you can get a great trap setup in return.
---
Hag is a great killer and imo she isn't even that difficult but she needs a bit of a different style to play. Also urban evasion and flashlights can counter her pretty decently but she can still win its not like its a guaranteed loss at this point. I suggest you look up "SpaceCoconut" on YouTube. He's a pretty decent hag main that also has some educational videos. 
---
finally someone using this meme to its full potential

Jesus fuck it’s still being wrongfully circle jerked. They didn’t do it to shame people. It was a bug. It was meant to only show when people in your party lacked maps, and accidentally occured to everybody on your friends list, but got hotfixed soon after.

Lmfao 1 game?  Absolutely not. I don’t keep count but I can say I’ve played a great amount of killer games/maining Michael and still no hate? Messages are turned on and everything. So I don’t want to hear it 
---
You misspelled Claudette
---
Maybe just don't give passive bonuses to the buy-only DLC, but to everyone else? Like the original cast and the ones you can buy with shards could have bonuses. I think that's a cool idea OP.
---
All you are explaining is that you don't get it. 
---
I may be garbage at the game but would i rather get my ass beat cause im bad then win cause im cheap
---
Kinda true, but in which dimension du u find a Legion player thats not toxic 
---
It’s been glitches since around the Hallowed Blight event iirc
---
...can it be nude body painting?

**Puts survivors on hook instantly the moment they are asleep and can press Left-CTRL to tea-bag**
---
“Reality can be whatever I want”
---
It’s fascinating owning this game on PS4 and PC and seeing how absolutely different the balance of the game is between the two
---
I really want it but it will never happen. Way too much work
---
Hag can be really strong but the counterplay is really easy. I feel like Hag is similar to Doctor in that they aren't super powerful but force Survivors to slow down and play differently because of how they work. Hag certainly isn't to the same degree as Doctor (lmao fuckin gottem), but she seems to do better the less knowledge the Survivors know about counterplay. 
---
I stopped playing about a week ago. Just can’t stand to wait more than 10 minutes for find a match. Been playing some GTA online with my time. Hopefully matchmaking will be improved soon. 
---
How is “gen rushing” toxic?  The point for survivor is to do gens and get out. Sorry whoever the killer is fails at stopping them.  Dear god 
---
This idea comes up every now and then I think it would make a great addition to the game. The passives just shouldn't be too strong. If certain passives proved to be too powerful everyone would just play that one surv because as opposed to killers they don't have any active abilities which incentives diversity. I'd hate going against the same surv every single game, it would be so boring...
---
I DON'T UNDERSTAND TEABAGGING AT THE GATES. I HAVE LESS THAN 3 HOURS PLAYING KILLER, I HAVE ONE TIER ONE PERK. IT'S LIKE BRAGGING TO A BABY ABOUT YOUR SUPERIOR ABILITY TO SIT UP AND NOT SPIT ON YOURSELF?
---
If you dont have leatherface get leatherface. He has two of the best killer perks imo. BBQ and chilli and Franklin's are great.
---
I've had a few, but I think most of them were just fucking devastated at how bad Legion is without Frank's. 
---
Literally nothing. It’s a very cheap strat that removes all levels of skill from the game. 
---
Remove legion devs, please I’m begging.
---

When it says "credit card", you can use your debit card there. A debit card is a credit card....just pulls from checking instead of "credit"
---
I’ve never seen anyone named that in the game??
---
It actually took me a bit to realize that
---
Why do I like edge lord Joe's karambit so much? Probably from seeing to much cs-go surf commentary videos but awesome job any way.
---
Those videos likely are from the past before her buff. Before then she wasn’t very good where as now she’s top tier.
---
The problem is that him being outclassed by the rest makes him "bad", but he isn't really far from the rest of the killers.
---
If we placed killers in fair tiers, we would only have S, A, and B. Freddy would be in B with Trapper and Wraith. 
---
Similar to me. I'm a Survivor main and i even consider on using DS just because i get onehooked everytime( i play solo) . Most of the other survivors are scumbags... I only teabag the killer when we make it out besides him facecamping.
---
true
---
But what makes him the worst ? Everyone keeps saying that but don’t have a valid point. I would say leatherface is way worse than Freddy. I’ve never been in a Freddy game where all four survivors escape. 
---
Ok dude, trying to get all fancy.
---
F13 died because it sucked! If it copied DbD a little it would have lasted longer. Had NOTHING to do with losing the license. It sucked from day one. 
---
DbD does this genre the right way. F13 tried to appeal to the masses and failed. 
---
Okay, no need to get too defensive 😊 just interested in everyone's opinion on the matter 
---
True, but he survived for a bit as an absolute badass
---
You got downvoted for speaking the truth rip.
---
There was a post on here a long ass time ago (like Summer BBQ event i think) where someone Kobe'd in the basement while Billy was carrying another Survivor on there
---
The Billy whacked them in the face leading to the backflip animation and they died the second they landed.
---
It happened so fast it seemed like Billy hit her so hard the game registered it as a mori
---

Rank might be a factor here, because I play pc and get matches right away on both killer and survivor (middle ranks to rank 1)

---
IT REALLY DOES MAKE MORE OF A DIFFERENCE THAN YOU'D EXPECT.
---
Run into his los but he would probably justm1 then anyways
---
True but you don’t account for playing with.
---
"happy death-day" has a really silly looking killer, nothing about that mask is unnerving or scary
---
Once you get enough perks and get a few add ons she becomes great

She’s sneaky

Ruin was there maybe 2 months ago right after the halloween event... but I caved for bbq, even tho i never play with LF. I think getting blood warden would be dope tho (especially with the update) since i will never buy Freddy

Except they aren't even really addressing the problems with Legion either lol
---
He didn't make the song I don't think he can do any of that lol
---
I usually tend to have mercy on survivors who had people DC during the game but if they haven’t finished even one gen yet them I’m killing them all as quickly as possible. I don’t got time to let them do gens to get out
---
U can see her if you put resolution to 0% and brightness to Low setting. 
---
Yeah and I've seen people do really poorly with Billy at rank 1. Neither means that they are weak or strong
---
BHVR doesn't need to hire someone to play a song they found on the internet in the background
---
Everyone would only play a character or two because their passives would be the best (Probably Meg for a slight Running speed bonus and Feng for a slight Vault speed bonus)
---
They're fine as skins imo
---
Love this 
---
Nothing worse than having to hook somebody in plain sight of a totem 😞😞
---
This is amazing, it should be the opening cinematic honestly 
---
Ahh then go with spirit. Her perks are decent and shes fun to play
---
i stopped playing it's just frustating it feels like i am all alone playing the game, and this game is not one that you can play alone so.
---
Lmao it won t change anything. I ll still dc if i see a legion.. devs fix u re game!
---
Yeah, but he's easy to edit because of his completely black clothing lol. 
---
Getting face camped is their goal. That’s the quickest way for you to let them know that they got under your skin

Hey creator , maybe you can try with Laurie mori Myers :))) (Huntress mori) I credit you on instagram @angry_huntress , ppl love your work &lt;3

Can you imagine a P3 MM with tombstone plus tuft coming at you with enduring, brutal strength, spirit fury, and play with your food?

Why are so many of the Joeys I see like this? I want to get that cosmetic, but that's pretty much begging for toxicity now because of these assholes.
---
I have more issues with that one witchy bitch that can appear out of no where (X mark?) than with legion(So far anyways) I'm sure that might change if i ever get to the red ranks :P Only been playing again for about a week or two since release(So many new killers since myers have been added damn!)
---
I have no idea if I said it wrong(weak English), but if so thank you for pointing out if not mind your own oink buisness.
---
The only way it would be worthwhile is with skins. Sorry, upping the bloodpoint cap is worth less.
---
They simply don't care about console players since it's an irrelevant percentage of players for them. Therefore... 
---
F13 sucks despite having actual varied gameplay, as opposed to 'fix gens to win' sure buddy. keep deluding yourself that dbd is actually fun.
---
Good idea!
---
Deja Vu?
---
Frank is 100% twink. Otters are hairy 
---
Sorry, didn’t mean to offend! But yes mate, the chances of escaping on the last box should be dramatically higher. What you meant to say was  “8% of players escaped on the last box.”
---
"Bad Manners". So in videogames that means stuff like spamming emotes or posting passive-aggressive things on the chat. Like spamming the pointing-emote or tbagging is BM.

So the bug is that when the survior searches a Jigsaw boxes without hetting the trap of the Pig can hear the puppet(called billy) laugh all around the map.

Definitely color it! But keep this one because I think the black and white is cool, too.

I responded to the guy above you you can read it there.

Almost like the killer from Valentine.

Probably nothing.  There is so much else going on I expect legion will probably stay as he is. If they buff him he could easily become nurse tier and if they nerf him he could make Freddy look good. 
---
I’m not sure what to expect with balance patches. Survivors are dcing so much lately i imagine its skewing the info they pull from for escape percents and making things all kinds of screwy. I haven’t played survivor in like a week or 2 because every game someone dc as soon as they take a hit
---
Hardpillz is a troll. He often shits this nonsense. Gens are done. Gates are open. Hook is next to the gate. The only strat here is to facecamp, and let the other guy go free.
---
Out of curiosity, are reverse bear traps affected by survivor's luck or is it predetermined which box frees them?
---
its not toxic
---
the guy who was teabagging is the toxic player he is just trying to justify his toxicity and falling flat
---
Billy idles past on his tricycle...
---
Yeah I notice that too. 
---
I think it’s because his map pressure is low and a lot of players don’t like killers like that so they completely ignore his amazing chase potential because of it.
---
I don’t a killer story mode would work. The F13 challenges are cool but have no story except for a funny intro. I feel like it should either be clips or a linear path for you to survive. For example, you play as Vigo or Baker trekking through the woods being pursued by Trapper or maybe it’s a stealth section where you have to hide for a specific amount of time. I think coop would work in this but just that. 2 player coop similar to Far Cry 5.
---
It’s predetermined 
---
Luck doesnt affect it.
---
Agreed. I go through with lobbies that have four toolboxes all the time knowing full well that even franklins demise and ruin won’t stop them from completing all gens in 10 seconds. Never dodged a lobby and never will. All I do in that case is try to make them leave without any of their toolboxes lol
---
I LOVE IT WHEN PPL YOU PLAY WITH COMPLAIN WHEN I BRING OBJECT OF OBSESSION AND THEY BRING DS  AND THEIR NOT THE OBSESSION AND APPARENTLY ITS TOO HARD TO WIGGLE TO 35/40/45%.  LIKE SOMEHOW ITS MY FAULT THAT YOU CANT BE BOTHERED TO WIGGLE WHEN GRABBED
---
If I throw on monstrous shrine on to my bamboozle Nurse it doesn’t make it much better does it? 
---
*Amanda undresses* 
---
Me: No not that kind of game
---
Billy:YES
---
haha yes 
---
Teach me how to moonwalk on console and I’ll be impressed.
---
81 years later...
---
Camping during the early and mid game. All for tbaggin. Gens done. Gates open. Hooked survivor literally next to gate. Yeah, camping is the only strat to be had.
---
Dam that bums me out but I’m pretty sure your right! They should definitely rework him completely I think ! His ability needs to be looked again ! 
---
You do have a point, killers with good map pressure are definitely more liked excluding Legion.
---
Wraith is B even now? 
---
OK IT'S ON. I GOT FACE CAMPED, TEABAGGED BY PIG AND I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. BUT DAMN LET ME BREATHE WHEN I GET THAT 4% CHANCE OF UNHOOKING MYSELF.  MY BP'S SHOULD MULTIPLY AT THE END OF THE GAME BECAUSE THAT "4K EZ" REALLY BOILS MY BLOOD **BOI.**
---
HEY, WHERE YOU THE BUBBA WHO KEPT 3 SURV IN THE BASEMENT, KEPT DOWNING US AND LET US HEAL AND THEN KILLED US ALL? IF SO.. THAT SHIT WAS THE WEIRDEST FARMING EVER BUT THANKS FOR BEING AN OK DUDE, JUST IN CASE IT WAS YOU! 
---
I feel like Frank might be hiding some thick patches of hair underneath that hoodie
---
Lol is so much worse lmao. The worst toxicity I’ve ever seen in dbd is kys, climb above like d3 in LoL and elaborate death threats and suggestions of how to hang yourself with shoelaces are basically part of the end game screen. 
---
Honestly, anything can happen as long as we persist to beleive... even shirtless Myers
---
Maybe in low ranks lol but high elo EUW and NA are easily the most toxic gaming group, maybe besides Csgo because people are actually yelling in your ear instead of typing 
---
Welp. Guess I'll have to get used to it
---
Lol I love playing against bad nurses cuz I feel like I’m good. Also I still get salty people but not nearly as bad as Xbox.
---
Actually it's ~10% if you consider all 3 escape attempts (each 4%).
---
Anyway, yeah it's never worth it unless you have no other possibility.
---
i've been crying for mystery inc inspired skins for so long this is beautiful 
---
I'm saying it's two people in a lobby or me and someone joins then 5 seconds later someone else does. Everyone is so scared of swf.
---
Hmmmmmm yeah I can see why you would say doc is better than wraith with yellow addons. With any addons I just think wraith is way better, double windstorm allows for insane map pressure. I’ve just found doc is very limited in high ranks, as survivors don’t care about being found whatsoever. 
---
I love this way more than I probably should.
---
I considered adding Doc and Huntress as the knights in the background but it ruined the a e s t h e t i c
---
True. A nice killer is a Paradoxon anyways.
---
Ohh your bear trap stuffed up what would have been a mean as hatching video!!
---
&gt;They're fine as skins imo
---
Preach
---
Those Freddy buffs. 
---
So, what is this Reddit Gold thing I've heard so much about, and how do I give it someone twice?
---
I feel like the rotation on the shrine needs to be shorted like 3 days. Sucks waiting  7 days to see if a good perk will show up
---
Red fits better for that cosmetic IMO. But also I never thought the Nurse could be a red head.
---
Also it’s just fan drawings in the end
---
Thank you very much! :D
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Okay.
---
I've had great games with 0-1 kills and terrible games with 3-4 kills.  Just chase them out and collect your BP and move on.  If other people want to be immature, that doesn't mean it should be reciprocated the same way.  It's stuff like this(from both sides) that grows the toxicity in the game, that people use as a justification for their own toxic actions.
---
I see a lot of people saying things that amount to "Oh it's fine if I do something toxic because everyone else already is." First of all, not everyone is. Second of all, someone else's toxicity is not a reason to engage in it yourself.  Be the change you want to see in the world.  Really, having a more positive view of things makes a *tremendous* difference in how much salt is generated from matches.
---
&gt; while they flop about like a dead fish
---
That doesn't sound too hard.
---
That last one made me laugh
---
I am at 149/180 and will complete it too!
---
You can’t prestige past 3.
---
All cool ideas
---
This isn't even bad
---
I was thinking Witcher... The queen of Touissant from the Blood and Wine DLC. 
---
When i was new to the game i used insidious on wraith whilst cloaked. I didn't know how terror radiuses worked
---
Legion main here.
---
They need to rework them slightly so they don't depend on an op add-on to be viable.
---
I feel like the final one should be "not camping and getting more than 1 kill before the survivors escape" (though i know at low tiers people are stupidly altruistic when a killer hook camps leading to easy kills
---
Fuck forgot to mention you should be able to prestige more than that.
---
Thank you sir
---
I see what your saying and I don’t have to win too have fun I play with my brother so we always have a laugh anyway but it would need some sort of balancing to make it fun and not stressful
---
I don’t know if it’s just me but sometimes the sound of the generator starting up as you work on it sounds like a heartbeat sometimes. Always throws me off.
---
They actually did try on the ptb for Legion but with Freddy they didn't even try a thing.
---
He isn't, though. The existence of his Tombstone add-ons shows he can kill at will, without appeasing the Entity through hooking and sacrificing. He kills for the Entity because he wants to, not because he's being told to.
---
Freddy almost needs his own separate game mode to make him viable. 
---
Yeah I know :)
---
As you say I think it's pretty much just psychological. A lot of people rely on the consensus that it's easier to do it at 50 and they feel a difference that isn't really there...
---
The survivors are meant to be skins, though. The killers are supposed to be the unique ones.
---
The frame rate makes it nearly impossible to play as nurse, also blinking to a survivor and turning to hit is a lot less accurate than with m+k. Billy and Myers are both more reliable in that regard.
---
That was as much effort as I was willing to put into this meme, and I only really did it because the font color clashed with the reflection of the blade
---
Haha, no that was actually my last meme post :) https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aeohmr/when_you_throw_coins_with_an_luck_ace_and_he/
---
I considered Ace and Slippery Meat, I tried SM a little a while ago and it didn’t seem worth it, I unfortch don’t have a lot of data on how Luck Aces fair on the hook, they’re as rare as hags nowadays...
---
Okay thank you! I mean, I feel pretty silly: asking for advice to extend chases, then realising I use no chase perks. I like the idea of using the drop to the basement to fool killers, as I already try to do similar techniques but without the perks to back it up. I’ll change up my perks and try it out, thanks again for the advice! 
---
Oh no Frank's is devastatingly effective, the problem is its literally unfun to use/play against
---
Yeah, I do drop people off at the hatch if the situation occurs. I killed 3 of them so I'm happy.
---
Tragic. Before hag buffs I forgot she existed lol. Now I don't really have the chance to forget killers, they're all playable at the least.
---
I play on console and rarely if not ever do all 4 survivors come in with blazing ping , which in the time killers usually dodge...the number fluncuates back and forth between 4 players naturally,negating a reason to dodge on just that alone.
---
2018?
---
He'd be the ultimate *Killer-form
---
I think from what I can gather is that the old dude is Jigsaw, but the puppet he uses is Billy. 
---
Just because Thing A sucks more than Thing B, that does not suddenly make Thing B less unpleasant.
---
The addons make such a difference in his gameplay that without addons he's crap tier and needs buffs, but with them he's so good it's boring to play as and against. Specifically Frank's, cooldown addons, and moonwalking make it so he can't be properly balanced.
---
The first thing they need to do is delete Franks, and then start balancing him and potentially redesigning him so it's not so easy to troll with him or against him.
---
&gt;give survivors a piggy mask
---
Cause people already get a heart attack from masked meg lets make it even worse (i love this idea tho)
---
Indeed, even when the killer is camping, actually trying to unhook instead of clapping and stalling for time is just making it worse but I suppose at that point some people just wanna leave the game...
---
that means my rule 34 folder is a-ok
---
Ultimate P I X E L A T I O N

Yo add me, I'd like to play with more people, too.  AgentWhiskerz

Yeah holy crap I have like 100+ pustula petals on Detective Tapp alone. 
---
F13 dev? 
---
F13's "varied" gameplay: Use Jarvis to troll Jason...just keep shooting and using a knives when he picks you up...repeat till Jason rage quits. Use glitches to reach places where Jason can't reach you....do this every game until Jason rage quits. Who's the killer this game??? Oh, It's Jason...good last game it was Jason and I didn't want to face Jason again...#variety! Oh yeah, let's start the car and leave everyone behind!!! Yeeeeehaw!
---
DbD is all about the chase and hiding from the killer. The gens are just the means to escape. The variety is in different killers with a WIDE variety of perks. In DbD you can't leave until everyone still alive can leave. 
---
Waaaaayyy less trolls in DbD. You can't fool me, I played both. I wanted F13 to be good do bad! I bought in on three freaking platforms. PS4, XOne and PC!
---
I don't agree, this game has cosmetics as its monetization. So they won't implement anything else to make money off except the chapters and skins.
---
TUNNELLING FUCKBOY KILLERS, YOURE MAKING ME WANT TO RUN DS, STOP FUCKING TUNNELLING OFF HOOK YOU CUNTS. ITS NOT A STRATEGY, OH NO SORRY IT IS, IF YOURE FUCKING BAD AT THE GAME. I NEVER TUNNEL AND DO VERY WELL, GET GOOD OR FUCKING UNINSTALL, YOURE SHIT.
---
I can already see it, a bloody Susie outfit. There should totally be more prestige cosmetics.
---
Hi, thanks for all the advice. I’ll definitely try swapping bond with empathy, and maybe swap out leader as well. Definitely did mean premonition, oops! Thanks! And if you think spine chill works better I’ll try that. 
---
I’ve actually only recently started using small game, simply because I’ve been playing against killers constantly using hex perks like ruin. And I thought it might help me to learn the spawn positions of the totems, if I leave it on for a few games. Then I’ll change it up. 
---
Thanks again! 
---
Wraith's high tier addons are better than doc's for sure. Except iridescent head and purple restraint notes, they are really good. Doc players in general tend to be better than wraith players too. Wraiths are more likely to camp and tunnel for some reason. Then relay on noed to get a couple of kills when they get gen rushed. I play doc and wraith equally and i think they are both solid mid tier while doc being better than wraith %70 of the time. Due to availability of low tier addons. Yellow restraint + yellow/commom electrode combo is cheap, common and extremely good, muh better than wraith's yellow and common addons(except the one that makes your TR and red stain disappear, if combined with silent bell).
---
That seems really cool, especially with the ban aspect. Although it would be way too much coding for the dbd devs to bother about. 
---
Depends if the survivor can loop or not. 
---
It was the only way. Unless I want a wiggle off...
---
At least u can grind for killers/survivors, other games they would be locked behind a pay wall
---
Sprint burst and self care were in the shrine. If those aren't crutch perks then I don't know what is.
---
&gt;1% of losing internet connection when getting  a trap on your head.

Take your upvote, goddamn it.
---
That worked, thanks!
---
You’re welcome 😊 
---
My friends and I would really love something like this, its gun and harmless. 
---
(Although not a fan of the +'s being on the left lol)
---
What is being toxic in this game though? I've had killers facecamp me and said i was toxic, All i do is repair gens/rescue people and in a chase try to stun the killer with a pallet to get the hell out of there... (I'm not sure what teabagging is in this game?)
---
I'm confused what makes someone toxic.(Solo player so i don't swf)
---
You’d still have to grind out all those points, if that is the intention it’s a weird one
---
I will do so with pleasur sir
---
If you're in OCE region I'd love to play a few games, otherwise it'll be too laggy aha. 
---
I was thinking more a legacy blight Wraith for the ultimate orange and yellow or a legacy pizza Dwight.
---
THE DEVS HAVE SAID THEY'D BUFF FREDDY BEFORE ANYONE ELSE. THEN TRAPPER, HAG, AND WRAITH GOT BUFFED BEFORE HIM. THEN THE DEVS SAID FREDDY WAS NEXT. FINE. THEN THE NEXT PATCH CAME AND NO FREDDY BUFF. SEVERAL PATCHES HAVE GONE BY SINCE THEN AND NOTHING. NOW PIG IS GETTING A BUFF BEFORE FREDDY. I AM *ANGRY*. WHAT THE ROYAL FUCK DEVS, JUST STOP LYING TO ME AND JUST SAY THAT FREDDY WON'T BE BUFFED UNTIL HE'S LAST, ALREADY!!!
---
You even dare point the thing at me, you deserve death. Them lights are nearly as disrespectful as the teabags.
---
Literally where else do you want the killer to be? An exit gate is open 1 micrometer from the hooked guy. He can't afford to go mucking about looking for other survivors, especially because he's legion.
---
Generally on PS4 it seems like the larger the SWF stack, the longer the queue time.  Solo is always the fastest, and 4 stack usually takes awhile, though 3 may possibly take longer than 4.   Either way, a 4 stack is not going to help like you might hope.
---
Yeah I heard that before, I’ve tried playing a killer a few times now. I have to say I don’t particularly enjoy it, but at least I now know how much they can see, and what their movement is like especially with actions such as breaking pallets and opening lockers 
---
If he just hit M1 during the time he watched the unhook, he would've initiated a grab and gotten everybody.  
---
Why are people downvoting this? SWF OP ig lol
---
Not with that free 1 mill bp. And not really; like I said, it's meant to be a grind.
---
Well, I guess if I’m ever the killer in your game you’ll have a good time.
---
You know the part of the horror movie where the final girl tips the scales and finally establishes the upper hand over her tormentor? Think of the tea-bagging and flashlight spamming as a representation of that trope. :)
---
Do you ever feel like some people are far too serious for reddit?
---
Not for me, when I solo queue it takes 5 to 7 minutes to find a game. When I'm with my friend it takes 20 to 30 mins. When I play killer I find a 4 stack SWF instantly.
---
More information:  
---
'Generators' refers to how many generators would spawn in the map, not how many need to be completed. Adding more generators would change how many are needed to be repaired accordingly but would not be affected by an increase in survivor slots. (Meaning if you wanted more survivors and more generators to repair you would have to increase the survivor slots AND generator count) Example: 8 Generators set = 5 Generators needed to power gates. Actual image is a little misleading because it's set to '5' as an example which would make the amount needed '2'.
---
Yes, I'm aware that many of these features could take a lot of work to code and have working without it breaking the rest of the game. Most of this is wishful thinking or just what I would LOVE to have added in a perfect world. BUT I do think many of these features could be a possibility. Definitely would like to see the ability to add and remove survivor/killer slots to create your own custom games. Would also be nice to see more hook states as a feature because it could be an interesting dynamic where survivors have a big disadvantage (whether number advantage or generator amount) but are given more hook states to balance it out.
---
You had to be that guy, didn’t you?
---
Iridescent Mori;
---
4 charges. All hits are fatal. Movement speed is reduced by 80%. Killer's field of view is reduced by 60%. Terror radius is reduced by 80%. 
---
The main reason I want bots is so you can start a KYF game yourself when you want to test things without needing a friend to come on just for it. Could also be useful when you only have 3 survivors to play and just want to throw a random bot in to fill the spot. It could just repair generators and stuff to fill in for the missing survivor.
---
Random perks and items is a great idea, love that. Would love to see what wacky builds everyone ends up with.
---
Should have read the contract. You're in debt to the entity now.
---
I feel like a lot of this community are amongst the younger gen because growing up and even now playing any video game online comes with the insults , exploit abusers etc....figured at this point you have to have thick skin if youre going to venture into the online gaming world
---
I don't get it, it's only David there
---
You know damn well that It's because it makes her harder to see. In a game that's dark by default, a survivor shouldn't have that kind of advantage over any other.
---
It’s a neat idea but the amount of programming required would be pretty big and would likely take a number of years to make at the rate out devs update the game and whatnot. 
---
It's honestly not as bad an idea as I came in, expecting to read. That said, as someone who plays both survivor and killer (so I experience the toxicity both have to offer) I don't believe in punishing people simply for playing with friends. IMO, that's how you get people to stop playing your game. 
---
Well is good but ingame killers prefers to see where the blood trail points instead of the scratchmarks but very cool too
---
Is it just me or is it annoying that the blindfold covers her nostrils?
---
*Haunted grounds*
---
You don't have to play leatherface to spend your points on him and get the teachables.  Though, getting to use BBQ while you're grinding points for the teachable will likely net you the most points per match, even though leatherface's point gain isn't quite as good as some other killers(Doctor/Freddy/Legion/Maybe Wraith). An extra 60/80/100% BP is pretty significant, but not worth it if it's not enjoyable enough.
---
As far as optimizing the bloodpoints you gain from each match, don't worry about securing kills and instead actively hunt down survivors and get as many chases/hooks as possible. BBQ makes this easier, as you'll often have a new target after each hook.  If someone is looping very effectively/near a lot of pallets don't be afraid to force a pallet or two down then go chase someone else you can hook more easily, unless it's the last person you need for all 4 stacks on BBQ or something then it's probably worth it from a BP standpoint. 
---
Good riddence
---
I swear to God if I see Tenacity one more fucking time I will actually fucking shit myself. Why put something useful BBQ or Ruin on the shrine when we can put FUCKING TENACITY SPRINT BURST AND OVERCHARGE 85 TIMES IN A FUCKING ROW
---
Yes, choke me nurse, please.
---
entity very displeased 
---
I dunno how to feel about your idea, like if it would be balanced at all, but I think it'd be more interesting and funner for both sides if it was a buff to killer rather than a nerf to survivor. 
---
If you are unhappy with this game as killer, go play supermash bros instead..
---
Of course. Just wishful thinking :) Just imagine how great it would be. 
---
To each his own.
---
Just ignore toxic survivors, it isn't that hard just to force them to leave.
---
Torn party streamers? Uncommon and 50% to everyone. Please devs 
---
I KIND OF LIKE LEGION THOUGH? ITS THE ONLY KILLER IVE BEEN ABLE TO PLAY, BUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THE POWER WORKS AND I HAVEN'T PLAYED AGAINST THEM YET, I USUALLY JUST STAB PEOPLE REGULARLY AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.
---
Actually, this game was intended to be played with three other random solos. SWF just got added last minute because people were complaining that they had to lobby hop to play with their friends.
---
Beware about that. On Low quality there are some things that just don’t exist. There are certain bushes and trees that just don’t appear in low quality. 
---
Honestly, I don't. Though, I'm not afraid of playing in a *toxic* manner to beat a SWF group. For instance. I noticed a group of 4 (all with flashlights) come into my lobby. I quickly switched to Franklin's Demise and Deer Stalker. I slugged everyone so I couldn't be blinded, then threw each of them on a hook. I got spammed with messages after the game with how shitty a killer I am, but I don't let stuff like that get to me. 
---
This is just one example. You do what you gotta do to win. The mechanics of the game are setup to do exactly that. Don't let others bitching and moaning to you stop you from trying to win the game. Now, if you have some stance where you refuse to play in a *toxic* manner, that's on you. I don't have anything against that either, but you bet your ass, I'm doing everything I can to win the game. Both as a survivor and as a killer. 
---
He made the choice to do The Sacrifice because he had Lung Cancer. In the comics you learn Bill had cancer, and Zoe killed her father when he was immune to the Zombie plague because before she found out he was bitten.
---
It's not "punishing people simply for playing with friends". You're acting like SWF doesn't commonly use voice comms.
---
When I say patrol I mean hard camp. But not face camp. I’m talking stat within 8 meters of the hook. Why? So you don’t get teabagged for 1 kill. 
---
isnt that a good thing for the killer? lol
---
He's right, though. The chances of getting the right box is 1 out of the total amount of boxes in the game. More boxes = more chance of being the incorrect one. What you found out is how many people find it on which box searched. A lot of people guessing the right box on their first try assuming 4 boxes means almost 48% of people guess right on a 25% chance. 
---
If people struggle this much they should just crutch along with NOED. But I’ll upvote you to counteract the angry babies

Monstorous Shrine makes it so if they get hooked in the basement, it's game over. It's fine as it is.

Myers, Amanda, Leatherface and Freddy are all locked behind a paywall.

You have to keep lower ranks in mind too

Allows you heal survivors from the death state
---
It's almost like this thread has zero actual discussion potential,  and responses will either agree with you or disagree with you.
---
It's almost like you asked us to respond if we had similar thoughts.
---
I dont think its worth hiring actual writers to polish this turd though 
---
Attempting with reverse psychology 
---
But with sprint you immediately use it then gone :O
---
*Gets hit with Franklin’s* ‘My flashlight! I can’t be toxic without my flashlight!’
---
Thank you! I don’t wanna see just a stronger Freddy with the same problems because then you’ll see him way more often. Not what I want to happen atm. 
---
First of all that is cheating as the killer and if you do it purposely you are an asshole. 
---
Second I figured we were talking about survivor but realized they never specified. 
---
(You yourself is not an asshole just saying that I think it is despicable to do that as killer. It means they can’t actually win on their own skill.)
---
Looks like the chance of removing a beartrap is 50% regardless of which box the player attempts to remove it at. Would explain the numbers. So there is no reason to move a specific keybox other than to avoid the killer. 
---
Because I said I don't believe in punishing people for playing with their friends, your assumption was that I don't think those people communicate with each other during the game? I'm curious how you came to that conclusion. 
---
That first one sounds annoying af. Basically survivorss have to either hand over kills or risk losing bloodpoints. A better one might be traps placed over trap kills. 
---
That's basically a swf these days 
---
Yes, I do. As rank 10 I don't consider myself as high or low rank. But some killers are only viable in lower ranks, like Freddy. Freddy can still be fun to play against, as his power is somewhat viable, but legion is mostly good in lower tier, and the game makes him seem better than he actually is. 
---
Attempting with reverse psychology
---
I don't know, he literally DC'd after 30 seconds so I frankly don't know what happened...
---
spicy cj tech on console
---
1000 seems way too low considering you can get that in around 3 levels 
---
Therefore, if BHVR wants to keep the game fun and playable for the killers, you have to make the killers have somewhat of an advantage over survivors, as they are much slower.

Ya know everyone needs a break... even a god that devours human souls and reanimates them over and over and over again until all hope is lost :)

If this is accurate, this means Pig's Boxes straight up don't work like they're supposed to.
---
There's supposed to be one box with a matching key out of four. If that were the case, the odds of getting the key of
---
If that were the case, you'd expect the following data spread.
---
&gt; 1st Try: 25% of population (25% of population)
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 2nd Try: 25% of population (33% of the remaining 75% of population)
---
&gt; 3rd Try: 25% (50% of the remaining 50%)
---
&gt; 4th Try: 25% (The remaining 25%)
---
&gt; Died to Trap: 0% (or a similarly marginal value)
---
Instead, this data suggests that each individual box has a 50% chance of being successful, with the last box being guaranteed if none of the others were successful.
---
&gt; 1st Try: 50% (50% of population)
---
&gt; 2nd Try: 25% (50% of remaining 50% of population)
---
&gt; 3rd Try: 12.5% (50% of remaining 50% of population)
---
&gt; 4th Try: 12.5% of population (the remaining population)
---
This matches up almost perfectly to the actual data, so yeah seems like it's broken.
---
Not completely true. The devs had the SWF feature in store since the beginning, or at least thats what they said.
---
But thats exactly how it is
---
maybe just an unlucky DC 
---
Fire up doesn't need a buff, while not being good it is basically a synergy perk with bamboozle. 
---
The fact that no one can agree that Legion is either OP or terrible tells me that they're actually in a pretty good spot. 
---
The Feral's ability works like Doctor's, he can switch back and forth between it. Once out of Tracking mode scent trails won't be seen anymore and he gets back up on two legs with a small speed burst. The power bar works like Spirit's Haunting ability and if you use half of the ability and switch to hunting the remainder of the power won't be drained while in hunting but will drain when you get back into tracking mode. 
---
Instantly gives survivors an extra health state
---
Fair "in comparison" is the kind of skewed perspective this perception comes from. Jigsaw putting a chain through someone's jaw and expecting them to rip their jaw off is fair but Amanda welding the door shut is where we cross the line?
---
Mr serial killer can and should keep his opinions on what it means to "value life" to himself.
---
I mean if the map is better visible and refined on low quality vs high quality than its just dumb to not play on low quality.
---
I was wondering why Nea was Scooby. The reveal at the end made me laugh. Really good stuff dude!
---
I guess so.  Thank you
---
The trap was made by Amanda, not Jigsaw...
---
It's obscenely annoying even with them toning it down from the blindingly annoying white screen. It's pretty much a rage button, you click that light at me, and I'm seeing red again.
---
You mean the hag? Her marks are a triangle. You can just crawl or use flashlight to avoid them. Small game perk too
---
To fuck with OP
---
Amanda was the living proof of John's "games" working and he paraded her around to his wife as such. Except unsurprisingly, being tortured didn't really help her, as we can see by her breakdowns in the third film. John just replaced her addiction. If even her, the only subject to survive their own test at that point (ignoring retcons in subsequent sequels) wasn't fixed, then what's the point of subjects even being able to survive? If no one is fixed by John's games then why bother with the facade of salvation and not expose it for it is - punishment.

Thank you! I don't make stuff like this very often (I used to do it a lot with call of duty zombies though) and I've finally gotten around to making this. Also working on some perk rework / change ideas.
---
Glad you like the ideas! A lot of it is wishful thinking, I'll admit, but I think some of these features could have a chance of being added at some point. Possibly after dedicated servers drop?
---
and waste his own BP?
---
Oh god I just got this quest and I just now realized that it was seconds not points...
---
Yeah, most times she will wind up for an Axe Toss, and if you’re quick you can flip it before she throws it, and crouch off to the side and avoid it, buying you even more seconds to run away.
---
If it was working like they say it is, there shouldn't be a pattern. The numbers would be all over the place. Chances are the devs are saying its working like that and it isn't just to get customers off their backs.
---
Of course it is also small possibility that this data collection "just happened" to produce numbers like these but who knows.
---
It’s dumb to CHEAT because the map is more visible. Welcome cheater. The devs are not in the mode of making the maps easier for killers. If the map is tough to see for killer it’s suppose to be because the killer is OP already. Making the map lighter just so you can see survivors is cheating. Part of the game is being able to track in any condition. 
---
Affirmation Action??? TF?
---
1000000
---
Waiting on total drama island
---
nurse needs a buff
---
Legion and freddy both need total reworks. I think the killer most in need of just straight buffs is the Wraith. Probably Leatherface too though not as badly.
---
😂 Yeah, quick tip, delete it immediately. It’s next to no blood points &amp; it takes the longest to do. Literally any challenge is easier &amp; better reward.
---
If it worked the way it was supposed to, 25% of the population would get it off on each try.
---
I'm still trying to reword his ability to make it sound accurate and game base but my mathematics skills are far from good lol XD but I was aiming toward 110% since he does get a speed boost in tracking I just need to find out his speed boost in hunting. 
---
if i happen to see you and no one else........ im gonna go for ya, it be  like that some times
---
Survivor.
---
Only because I’ve only ever played one match as Killer and boy did I suck.
---
I still suck as a Survivor, mind you... 
---
No one can explain this to you.
---
Just don’t give him one, make him 115% like most killers and give him a 3% or 5% boost in tracking 
---
New killer, new player no doubt.
---
Don't play nice as a killer, because survivors sure as shit never will.
---
True.
---
Your student loans have transferred to DBD.
---
There is nothing cheating about that, literally nothing. It's an in-game graphical option. It's not making the map lighter, its making the map better visible as different objects are refined and not clogged by other graphical stuff. You seem like some salty hardstuck survivor lmao. Are you ok?
---
WHY DO GENS OR SAVE PEOPLE WHEN YOU CAN URBAN EVASION LAP THE MAP
---
Ok, and you felt like writing out this speech other than just not responding at all, because...?
---
I'll say killer because I like protecting the basement chest
---
Or I could say survivor because I actually try to win
---
nah I'll say killer
---
Probably lagswitch

As a reminder, I'd like anyone who has an answer to vote on the poll if possible. Comments are fine just make it clear you voted in the poll as well. 
---
.Downvotes The ,Lmfao
---
Heal²
---
Yea I guess so. I play both evenly I think, more killer lately tho so idk how likely that is
---
The best minute of my life.
---
Zubat and Scott never use ruin on Billy and constantly 4k with him. Wdym
---
Just smack them, they'll leave
---
How do you know than in average Legions get 2-3 kills ? Are there any official statistics about killers performance ?
---
Agreed, they aren’t greedy at all. It’s cosmetics...doesn’t change the gameplay whatsoever and the perks you can “buy” are purchasable only through points you earn by leveling.
---
How to make dance with me useless.
---
60% surv 40% killer ~~ around this
---
Pls
---
Ah gotcha. 
---
Never said he started it, just popularized a specific build on a specific killer. Just watch whatever his most recent DbD video is and the game is riddled with whatever he did that day. But thanks for the unnecessary insult, glad the video game behavior carries over to the reddit. 👍
---
pls make more of this, or if you have id really enjoy checking it out aswell. great work &lt;3
---
Ifs it's average killer games with legion, than they won't mess with him. He may be the un fun stuff to a lot of people but I personally enjoy him on both sides and he clearly isn't wiping the survivors up. To be honest they should leave him alone and actually focus on other things. Bugs and Freddy.
---
He probably could've pulled her off easy. 
---
Thought it was more light hearted than saying reparations. It's a joke. 
---
HONESTLY, AS KILLER I TRY TO LET PEOPLE GO WHO GOT UNHOOKED MEER SECONDS AFTER I HOOKED THEM AND ATTACK THEIR “SAVIOR” BC IT HAPPENS SO MUCH 
---
This is what I was thinking. David could definitely beat up Legion, even if he or she has a knife.
---
I SWEAR WHEN I PLAY SURVIVORS, ALL I GET IS DICKS WHO WILL UNHOOK ME IN FRONT OF KILLER AND FARM ME TO OBLIVION.
---
I DROPPED 2 RANKS BECAUSE OF SUCH ARSES.
---
OR WHILE IM CHASING THEM THEY DECIDE TO UNHOOK SOMEONE JUST TO THROW THEM UNDER THE BUS I MEAN FFS TEAMWORK ANYONE?!!
---
Ill use attempting to escape as a way to tell people to get their ass to the hook and rescue me. Sucks watching two guys work on a gen miles away while the other guy is getting chase but hasnt taken a hit so they dont know hes in chase and probably assume hes coming to rescue me. 
---
Your face says female 
---
but your hair  says male
---
so which is it
---
That's all I can think about "Is he a male or female?" 
---
nothing else
---
Yeah, just like how everyone only ever plays 1 or 2 Killers. Oh, wait....
---
Best DBD opening EVER! This is what peak performance looks like. Good job bro! May the perks be ever in your favor. 👏👏👏
---
Tea bagging is justified when anyone face camps, if you think it makes someone a bad persons you’re just a baby.  I tea bag when nothing bad happens that’s just because I like being toxic, when I play killer and I do something scummy I expect to get tea bagged.
---
Because unless "mains" or high ranks most pig are terribly bad. They play Make Your Choice + traps and tunnel the same guy over and over instead of going for the exposed farmer who unhooked. Those kind of pigs usually runs NoeD to catch a second / third kill once the generators are powered.
---
U go gurl! 
---
Because do to not being able to attack the boost isn’t OP
---
Freddy’s power is essentially a weaker version of the wraith’s in many ways. He is invisible and unable to interact with players until a relatively long time (7 seconds without addons) after you have decided you want to do that. That time is enough for any decent survivor to get to a pallet loop, activate their exhaustion perk or in someother way give themselves the advantage in the chase. Once the chase has started, Freddy is just a killer who moves at 115 speed and has no abilities to make that chase any easier on him. It leads to Freddy getting horribly looped by skilled survivors because he has no power to mitigate it. The big upside to freddy is that he can put lots of survivors thst are grouped together into dream world simultaneously, but he can only really chase one of them at a time and takes so long to chase because he has no chase related ability that the other survivors will all break out of dreamworld before you catch your target. If i had to give freddy one strong feature about him, it is that he will almost always eventually get the guy he is chasing. The ability to see auras of anyone outside his terror radius means escaping him is almost impossible. Unfortunately, that being a fact is pretty unfun for survivors.
---
The short version, freddy’s power actually makes it more difficult to catch people than if he had no power at all or just a simple chase power like clown. He needs a rework so that his power isn’t actively hindering him from being able to down survivors.
---
*sets game graphics to low quality
---
&gt; First of all that is cheating
---
Did you actually just say that? Or did I misinterpret?
---
Boring? Its the best! 
---
That's not me in the video. Her name is Alexis, she's a female.
---
Kinda like the flashy 80's cosmetics, no?
---
Happened a few days ago in Lery’s. Was working on a gen and turned the camera half a second before he pulled me off the gen. We were all mori’d to death.
---
ALSO THE REASON I DONT PLAY SURVIVOR MUCH AT ALL IS BC I GET STUCK WITH GROUPS WHO DONT KNOW WHAT SKILL CHECKS ARE AND ALWAYS ATRACT THE KILLER TO MY GEN OR DONT KNOW HOW TO RUN FROM THE KILLER AND GO FROM FULL HEALTH TO DOWN IN A MATTER OF SECONDS AND BY THE END IF THE MATCH THERES THE  2 GENS DONE THAT I DID AND EVERYONE ELSE IS DEAD MEANWHILE I CANT FIND THE HATCH FOR MY LIFE AND GET STUCK BELOW RANK 10!!!
---
I still play normally if there’s one DC, but if there’s two I just feel too bad so I let them get out 
---
He doesn't need it. Unless you're playing a 3-4 man SWF squad or the map is cancer like Haddonfield he's fine. Equip Enduring + Spirit Fury and Bamboozle to just end the mindless looping and he's goddamn terrifying. 
---
Really? You think you’re misinterpreting? GG dude. 
---
&gt; This isn't salt (maybe alittle)

This is kind of the problem to me though. Everyone kind of cries about him being over, or underpowered which is simply the wrong question. You are right that a rework is probably not going to happen (i mean... Freddy after all...) but i still think it is worth acknowledging that the strength of his power isn’t the real problem with the killer, it is how it interacts with the core game mechanics.
