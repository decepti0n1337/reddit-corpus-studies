I agree with this so much. I camped an Ash who was hooked 10 feet away from an open exit gate with his whole team buzzing around. In the post game chat they shit talked me for facecamping. Like, tf you want me to do? Leave him alone so he can escape for free?

Apparently restarting the game using Task Manager since the game got stuck, and couldn't be started normally made me not lose give or take 120k blood points pls fix and give me my hard earned bloodpoints back :P.

If the devs really wanted too, they could probably get the rights to Jason now that the official license is getting a new holder but I don't think they will out of respect for F13 as a rival game or purely out of not being interested in said license.

I got that one on accident from a camping wraith.  I did finally get Left for Dead
---
Wish he used different outfit.
---
on ps4 the trophy section it says "dead by daylight 1/2" what does that mean?
---
Yes, add the perk with a new survivor. Maybe one that used to be a killer, but the entity got mad or something.
---
Yea... Just save your shards in case they ever show up :"(
---
Break line of sight and do gens
---
Unfortunatly i dont have doctor so would need the shire to get monitor and currently working on leveling nurse so i can get nurses calling as a teachable! Thanks for the help.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
Extra points, chances to down other survivors, getting ONE kill is that really important?
---
Yeah :/
---
Thanks for the update though! I really appreciate it.
---
It‚Äôs because you survivors are forced to play under the killers thumb for most of the time, the *second* they get any give from the killer they take advantage of it. When a killer is bullied it‚Äôs him/her not being able to hit the survivor or visual irks like t-bagging or spinning slugs. When a survivor is bullied they have to watch their character get brutally murdered and/or have to spam a-d and space bar for around 2 minutes.
---
It's a high quality prosthetic. You can see a ring of exposed wiring if you look at the wrist
---
Aren't we getting archives and charms with this stuff too though? If so I think it's ok to miss a survivor skin if we are getting the other stuff
---
Why you against the build? Just out of curiosity. Is it a bad build or is it dirty to play against or something?
---
im either playing hag or legion. if ur killer is called goodest boy chances are its me
---
Ew
---
Salty survivor main is salty. As many of you have said, he‚Äôs clearly never played Myers with those two addons together
---
Ew..... looks like I'm saving shards.
---
There is also points earned for Survival if you are the obsession and die (1000 pts) or escape (1500 pts). So one could use deliverance, then decisive strike to become obsession (if they aren't already) and escape
---
Why are you afraid of having to catch the survivor again if he's such shit, though?  I just don't get it.  Every incentive in the game pushes survivors toward unhooking and killers toward allowing unhooks and hunting elsewhere.
---
If you don't have monitor(which is what makes nurses super good on her since she had a smaller radius) I would suggest using sloppy butcher in place of it, or maybe thanataphobia but I'm still not sure if the numbers are good enough to warrant it's use, where sloppy is super good
---
Check the killer's connection before starting the game? 110 ms and lower is what I go for

Isn't he already OP enough? Or is that just me?

Sometimes you forget in the heat of the moment! (I too am not very smart.)

2Spooky man.
---
I wasn't around for it sadly, but I still get MOM to work at least once a match if I'm actually trying using a build like this along with it.
---
I did this once during a game that ended up being a farming session, simply because it had been so long since I'd gone against/with a No Mither I'd forgotten what it did.
---
Only thing worth here is Surveillance.
---
 All survivors are just skins, you do know that right??? There aren‚Äôt good and bad player models lmao
---
For real, bring borrowed time or D strike and stop complaining
---
I made a joke post about this and everyone got pissed off and thought I was complaining ;-;
---
&gt;no counterplay
---
No, he hard counters *a* perk, don‚Äôt run borrowed time and your slot won‚Äôt be wasted facing Freddy.
---
Killer mains are just crybabies at this point. Being killer was hard in 2016. It's a walk in the park currently.
---
Most killer mains feel entitled to a 4k every game, and if they don't get it, they will start to whine that survivors are OP. Whining about survivor perks to get them nerfed, while gleefully equipping insta downs such as iri head and permanent EW3, as well as ebony moris.
---
Silly man you think the nurse uses lube?

Say it with me kids: yet another week without Discordance!

Tbh I don't think I've ever gone up against a no mither if I have would've been a long time ago
---
You're toxic.
---
No mither is the worst perk in the game. It's literally iron will and Unbreakable but don't leave any pools of blood and you're constantly injured
---
Finger stonks: ‚ÜóÔ∏è

How would u know if it's a nurse and rank 1 tho?

Favourite: Devil Ghostface

Aw poor baby, show me where the nurse hurt you. :(
---
What do you mean it was just added to the story it was part of his backstory.
---
Hoffman never had respect for his teachings as I said before he was incredibly violent to his victims something that John disagreed with adamantly who was incredibly sadistic and enjoyed violence.
---
Once again the second of John died he started killing people who he saw as a nuisance.
---
Listen if you like Hoffman that's great but don't act like he's any better than Amanda both him and Amanda worth terrible apprentices.
---
We can make a debate all day on which one was worse and for which reasons but 
---
1) they both broke the rules. 
---
2) they both showed disrespect for John's methods. Both made unwinnable traps. both messed with traps. Both killed people Hoffman had a particularly high direct body count
---
3) They both were mentally disturbed. Hoffman having incredible sadistic tendencies and Amanda having emotional and dependency issues
---
You a PS4 gamer?
---
Ah, I have died on my first hook to your species many times.
---
Holy shit, it's already been a year since the last one.
---
*my tears act as a natural lubricant*
---
Yeah it's not even 100% iron will only 50% at least I think it is
---
it‚Äôs a meme
---
Can‚Äôt turn bubba into an Inbred Race car without it
---
Sadly, no. If enough people ask for it maybe, but it's very unlikely considering the history of the devs.
---
It's basically her default outfit plus more boils and pus.
---
Yup, pretty bad. Nothing for survivor here is worth 2k.
---
Bing bong gets his full invis but no infrared, pred gets his partial invis and infrared. So it would basically highlight any survivor like seeing an aura and add a blue filter on everything else except fires(to make it truly infrared).
---
I'd rather run No Mither than Deja Vu. Sure it's a horrible perk, but at least it does a tiny bit for me. You dont bleed and your grunts are quieter. Having all the maps memorized makes Deja Vu completely worthless
---
He would just point with his finger and instantly kill everyone in the match
---
Any advice on getting protection hits consistently? I like trying to make sub-par perks work, and I've been considering MoM.
---
I play killer and this is correct though i dont face camp not because HONOR CODE but because i want there to be a tiny chance they could kobe or grab the hook but im still in the general area
---
I think plague is balanced killers like bubba and maybe wraith are the ones that really need some love
---
And this happens after i unlock surveillance. Awesome.
---
I like it! BHVR take notes!
---
Felt like a couple of months ago dafuq happened
---
Honestly i agree it was bullshit but hooks respawning just feels bullshit. Sabo is now a meme thing, even when it works perfectly you wasted so much time doing hooks to 99% to save a survivor, they sometimes still get hooked or die almost immediately  I feel like they should of just made it 1 hook per section of the map that was unbreakable ala basement and left the rest breakable
---
I‚Äôm no game designer but i think i should be hired.
---
You could try to bait the rescuer to the hook and punish them .
---
Yes. Just get Feng for Lithe.
---
You do know about protection hits right? And that there is a specific bloodpoint reward for getting atacked while the killer is carrying someone, right?
---
And what is your Idea? Remove hitboxes while carrying someone?
---
They should make that a Plague skin.
---
Funny to see all the insane loading time complaints in the community for killer and all that jazz, while I was here on console, only needing to wait a couple minutes. Glad I can finally be happy about playing on Xbox for once.
---
Demogorgon: "hold my beer..."
---
It's literally a mechanic though, like that's what the items are used for. No ones making you camp the hook, but how else are you meant to use the instaheal items other than to instaheal?
---
Bummer. Thanks for the response. I'll keep dreaming about a hallowed blight Ashey Slashey.
---
It looks like a fire version of the headless horseman helmet from wow
---
You can use your shards for a cosmetic or use them on Surveillance for that bonus BP.
---
There*
---
I had one game where I was clearly outmatched. i was the killer and gens were being done left and right. The survivors were teabagging and looping me and I just couldn't even hit one of them (i'm fairly new with killer). I finally got 1 of them who had been the worst offender of teabagging and such. So I sat in the basement and watched him. His friends were right around the corner and so I didn't really want to leave him either. 3 of them end up escaping while the 1 I caught died.   
---
Of course in post game "wow, camper, nj fucking stupid killer". Like, 1) you bm'd me to shit and 2) 1 death and 3 surviving I think is a fair trade. Also, why would I leave a hooked survivor when I see you waiting for me to leave the area -\_-
---
After watching it again, he didnt even have a mask on at the gate lol
---
What if that survivor isn‚Äôt Jake, 
---
It‚Äôs Vigo.
---

---
Fuck you

---
"The classics nobody seems to mention"
---
People literally spammed this sub mentioned this when they announced Demogorgon and players realized the humanoid barrier had been broken.
---
I can't recall, can't the event skins only be purchased during the event with event currency? Or can they all be purchased with Auric Cells?  
---
I'm going to be on vacation during a lot of October and don't wanna miss that Jake skin!
---
It's not about being thin skinned, its about the mentality of people who play the game. There's no need to trash people learning the game, when they're a Rank 20 Killer with no offerings perks or addons, and you're a Rank 10 survivor with Ultra Rare perks and addons.
---
I really hate that "dont be thin skinned" argument, not being an asshole is literally the default, you don't have to do anything to not be an asshole. You have to actually go out of your way to be a dick to other people, for what? Stop excusing asshole behaviour or just hand waving it away as someone being thin skinned, or that it happens in all games.
---
Noed is one of the few perks that adds another objective ontop of the main objective which is doing gens. In order for survivors to fight against Noed, they would have to cleanse every single totem. So instead of Saving, healing, and doing gens, they now have to search the entire map for totems.
---
You know what sucks too? Because it's a coin flip on whether or not the killer even has it. 
---
Adrenaline doesn't add an objective for the killer. You dont have to steer off of your main goal which is hitting, slugging, hooking and sacrificing. 
---
Adrenaline haste boost lasts for a couple secs with only 1 health state being healed.
---
Noed is a skill that adds another objective on survivors, instantly downs, boosts your speed, and lasts forever unless the totems are cleanse.
---
They're not equal.
---
NOED has been the saving grace to so many shit games killers have played, from 0 downs to 3k - 4k. There is no "hah but you had adrenaline", because what if adrenaline worked like NOED? instead of it being called Adrenaline, let's call it EOED (Every one escapes death). The killer then has to look for it at the end or during the game and if he doesn't every survivor maintains the haste until it's cleansed. Now that's unfair right? Because the killer now has a 2nd objective, and we'll see WAY more survivors escaping than we already do now.
---
to be fair, the dwight and claude skins were INCREDIBLY dull
---
Pus juice
---
Not the fucking flowers again please im actually begging BHVR to fuck those flowers off out of my life.
---
I did, really really really really really really really like the skins that came in that event though.
---
Hag is fun to play and pretty good to
---
Oh, sorry. joined sub recently.
---
But I thought that was the point of building perks like Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, Sprint Burst, Borrowed Time, etc. or do the perks not quite work that way?
---
Also I thought that's why Survivors had the numbers advantage, or do people just play it "Every Man For Himself"-style?
---
Hum doctor, thats a demodog. We might need a vet instead lol
---
Him and Steve are the best designed male survivors in the game imo
---
The same exact thing can be applied to survivor mains. They get killer? Tunneled. They get unhooked right in front of the killer and get killed? Tunneled. The killers stayis for two seconds in front of an hook? Camper.
---
Swf can destroy almost every killer in the game, there are just two killers who can compete. Noed is stupid obv, but an adrenaline selfcare deadhard ds build is not so fun to plsy against.
---
People cry for everything lmao, survs mains who get salty if a killer complains. This game is unmabalnced, everyone in the community know swf is strongest than god in dbd. And wow, legendary addons and offers are strong, what a surprise, have you aver played against a 4 stack of new parts or pink flashlights lmao?
---
He hard counters a perk and gets a free down, that‚Äôs not balance my bro. That means Freddy can camp and tunnel the guy off hook with no counterplay
---
No. It goes the same rate in all cases except Monsterous Shrine in the basement.
---
1v4 perhaps, hopefully?

Sorry, but literally everyone mentions predator and xenomorph, they get brought up here almost daily. They also are currently not on the table, with predator getting its own assymetrical multiplayer game, and the alien rights pretty much being bundled with it.

Hell yeah jake mains rise up

damn

They still do get exclusive cosmetics when you buy the DLC but they don‚Äôt make them like they used to. Instead of a full outfit like Laurie, it‚Äôs just slightly different torn shirts of their defaults. Because they know they can make good money selling them separately

can someone explain obsession for me?

That is pretty nice tbh, it is just hard to use.

People use noed when they know they will lose, or when every surv has a toolbox, which is equal to losing lmao

Y don‚Äôt we just take the hatchets out of the locker and kill the killer?
---
&gt;free down
---
He hit you 2 times and hooked you and had to hit you 2 more times *after* you were *saved* from a hook, and you have to be running decisive otherwise it‚Äôs just normal tunneling, hardly a ‚Äúfree down‚Äù

This looks like a...trap

I‚Äôm legit getting all of them
---
Easy. Giant block of glass with wheels. Just stand on it and get pulled /s
---
No you are not preventing them from playing. Camping one person prevents them from playing, but if you go after the others then everyone has a chance to play equally
---
And i think you should change your conception of "toxic" cause changing the course of an entire match in a bad way, preventing 1 person from playing normally, denying altruism points for everyone else and Just wasting everyone's time only because you're salty sounds pretty toxic to me
---
You're def not crazy, okyou just doesn't know what he/she is talking about.

Oh wait, like your posts that are either deleted due to dumb spam or have negative karma?
---
Before talking down to people, know your place kid.
---
In the last month i mained spirit and lmao i bumped in so many people i would not have noticed while phasing, also the thing that your "body" can block survs while you phase is really strong, you can deny every loop. I love her and i would not vote for a nerf, but i admit she's annoying to okay against
---
I remember an image floating around  between the last two killers, it was perks for an original killer called the Banshee, then I'm guessing it may have been dropped because they got the ok to use stranger things and wanted to capitalize on it while it was a hot commodity.
---
Tbh I really like his giant ass hands.
---
Of course, it's kinda lazy of the devs to use the same model for he and Freddy, but it makes him stand out a bit, and I like that.
---
Bought him a couple days ago and he's really fun to play as. Got him to level 50 during bloodhunt quite quickly. Add ons are crucial to your gameplay experience, make sure you level myers up a bit.

Dodging high ping lobbies generally works, [but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt matter and nonsense like this still happens.](https://1drv.ms/v/s!ApOeRkbo1YHJgQP56Pvp7xK4Mpg7)
---
Hopefully we get something original. BHVR seems to do better when making a brand new killers compared to building off a movie or tv show.
---
anyone else hoping they let us use last years offerings cause my nea sure does lol
---
No I didn't and that hoodie is from lost and found. You obviously didn't read the cosmetic description because not only does it she she found it in lost and found and made it here's, but the cosmetics are literally called "Sophomore Jitters".
---
you didn't even read the second half of OP's title did you?
---
Nah. It was made in paint
---
Hes appearance is already on a rework, we just need to wait for a release
---
But his perks suck, tis true
---
Ok Chris
---
It really can't work. That's not how a psychotic brain works. When you think of Michael Myers, do you think there's any chance he's goung to pull of the mask, throw away the knife, and start fixing some generators?
---
How would killing the Killer be fun in literally any way at all? 
---
And that's not being balanced, that's being hard to achieve. It takes a while to get, so suddenly the Killer is going to be cool with Meg Thomas being able to kill them instead?
---
That's not fun, that's not balanced. It's never going to be either, because there's no way to make it fun or balanced.
---
Yep i dont know what theyre on about either, everyone was frustrated bexause of the fuckin blendettes urban evasioning around getting every flower then waiting an extra 10 seconds for the hatch because everyone was dead.
---
Ya lol im not giving this janky ps3 game any money.
---
I could be mistaken but I‚Äôm pretty sure the devs have said there‚Äôs other killers/survivors in the fog that we just haven‚Äôt seen yet. New characters aren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúnew‚Äù, merely new to US. As for the survivors you just listed, they were most likely ‚Äúshelled‚Äù. The lore doesn‚Äôt give a real name for it but basically a survivor eventually gives up all hope and is either cast aside as an empty husk of a person or is turned into a killer. Also forgot vigo, I assume that plunderer‚Äôs is his perk since it fits his theme of ‚Äúinventor‚Äù. Also, the original survivors we have have clearly met at least Vigo, considering Dwight is ‚Äúvigo‚Äôs apprentice‚Äù

" Camping is a game mechanic "  
---
That's like saying DC'ing is a game mechanic.
---
Why not Billy the puppet?
---
Or Ashy Slashy?
---
Yea, not great, not terrible...
---
Just keep stabbing bro, stab away the feels.
---
Lemme guess, this complete asswipe crouched a couple of times? Theres not really a way to be a cunt to someone in game other than being slightly irritating (provided the players are around the same skill level)
---
And the franchise killers seem to be OP, that nerf of freddie was shit, same with the pig, I know its salty, but when I go against either of them I disconnect straight away
---
No you suck.  Kappa.
---
Them*
---
Yes
---
I just more worry about the devs spaghetti code changing that one thing could break a lot about her. What they need to do I think is just not allow her to block a trigger zone to drop a pallet or window vaulting while phasing is what I think would be better. And if stunned in phase is knocked out of it immediately and stunned same because I don't think I've been stunned ever in a phase
---
Ehh i like playing against them personally but you have your own opinion.
---
Spirit is one of my leats favorite killers, and i'm still gonna buy this ine
---
I just used Chucky cause it was said earlier.
---
ok i don't care, but your suggestion is bad yet whenever someone points it out you just don't learn that it is in fact a bad idea lmao
---
Ive been getting camped and tunneled by red rank Ghostfaces non stop.
---
Fuck I already bought Quentin and I already have all Feng teachables
---
Well that's not getting used in any of her rule34 posts
---
I run this with boil over, hard to even pick me up lol
---
Valtteri , it‚Äôs James...
---
photoshop should suffice if you want to make a quasi believable perk; with some hefty image editing it should look pretty okay!
---
Oh lorr
---
Spirits floating hair is just horrible man. So ugly. I use the bun.
---
Sure this is a pretty bad shrine, but we‚Äôve gotten decisive strike, bbq and ruin all within the last 2 months, so I‚Äôm fine with this.
---
If they ever nerf her i require a buff to the shitty killers, i have a p3 trapper which is complet crap nowaday, just give him 10 traps at the start already
---
Cosmetics are much more important to them
---
This happened to me the other day. And then they had the balls to say *outplayed* in chat after. Smh.
---
You are the only one
---
I wish ash vs evil dead wasn‚Äôt cancelled
---
Valtteri, it‚Äôs James...
---
Love that he has one of the blight flowers on his lapel!
---
Happens to me everytime too :/
---
[removed]
---
Not soon enough
---
See here‚Äôs your issue. First you‚Äôre ascribing a feeling towards me. You‚Äôre saying that I‚Äôm salty. I never said that. Second, you can‚Äôt read. I play survivor. I don‚Äôt play killer except for few occasions where I want to have fun with survivors. This whole community needs to re-evaluate the word toxic. It‚Äôs overused to the point of hilarity.
---
Blood webs don't change until you level up, when he had this blood web he could have had all the perks at the time. So it is very possible this is an untouched web from years ago, in today's game. I know this because I prepped my Dwight blood web right before they changed it to 4 perks per web.
---
This thread gives me hope for the community, people letting tbagging damage them emotionally to the point of throwing the game away, then crying that tbagging is toxic when really its just that its tilts them and they dont know how to just stop focusing on them so hard
---
#ak
---
#header1 #header2
---
Dude, If you are having so much trouble, why don't you use iron grasp? Agitation? Mad grip? 
---
And i also play as killer, the problem isn't "toxic survivors" that don't put themselves into a killer's shoes. Is that you can't adapt to the game so then you say it's "broken" and that the company only wants money and whoever disagrees with you is a "selfish toxic player".
---
Thats....what I said
---
#Gaaawl Twuupa?
---
Now this, this is scary
---
exactly lol it made me laugh so hard so I was hoping it would make everyone else at least smile haha
---
How about just let him pick up as many traps as he can so he can just pick them all up or better let him just have like 15 traps spawn with him and no traps on the map itself
---
Eh his face looks pretty weird though compared to the actors face, also would‚Äôve preferred young ash
---
Thought you were saying it's fake.
---
Camping is a mechanic that the game will punish you for with reduced points, instaheals, flashlights, BNPs are game mechanics with no downside to using them
---
Pls tell me this is a joke. 
---
Nurse with Omega Blink, hell fuck it. No perk Nurse
---
Spirit with Mother Daughter Ring + Prayer beads
---
Iri Huntress
---
Any killer + Hex devour/Noed, Make your Choice.
---
So many builds shit stomp SWF that I'll just stop here at 4. 
---
Most of the bullying come from SWF streamers who have mastered the game and they're up against okay killers. Have you seen killer streams or highlights? Have you watched Otz? Have you seen nurses shit of SWF on youtube? Do you like taking in one side of the pill and be biased about the current situation? 
---
The effort you have to put in as survivor to even make half the blood points a killer makes after his god awful shit performance is ALONE unfair lmao. Self care isnt a good perk, it wastes time, GOOD killers want you to heal, not sure why this perk would make you tilt?
---
Absolutely no problem buddy. Keep being a shitty killer main.
---
Literally the only reason i take "No one escapes death" for my legion is to deal with those asshats, sometimes i just get rushed by all of the survivors that were alive and they end up losing the game because i stab all of them and get an insta-down, its fucking idiotic to camp (Unless ur playing wraith) and will end up with an loss, but leaving the hook when the fates are open is as idiotic if not more.
---
My girlfriend mains Hag. And plays as the hag mainly in dbd too...
---
Looks awesome ! Is it comfy? Looked a little big so ordered a size up
---
Idk if i should buy him for discordance, Clown for pop or the plague for her gen trap perk, any advice?
---
The fact that this is actually upvoted just goes to show how survivor sided this sub is.
---
I agree this behavior isn't necessary.  But I'm in my thirties and I'm playing a game online with people probably ranging from age 13 through their mid-20s.  So it's on me if I let my non-peers upset me, or if I just ignore them.  I guess it could hurt more if age doesn't let us feel so distant from immature behavior.  (I'm not saying I'm old and wise, I'm simply saying that at this point I don't care about or even understand some of this meme-y video game behavior).  I do get frustrated when I get handily outplayed by a more experienced team due to bad matchmaking, but I also know survivors don't know my rank and it will take them a while to realize I'm an easy mark -- and even then, they may as well try and escape or protect their lower-ranked teammates.  I still remember getting destroyed by some rank 10 when I was rank 20 killer and didn't even know why I couldn't get a hook due to crouch bodyblocking.  But like, what was that player supposed to do?  Assume in advance I'm shit and not use a valid technique to rescue the rank 20 I was hooking?
---
Yeah and hitting 3 survivors is enough time for their comrade to wiggle out . After that, this game being the unbalanced mess it is, they'll all infinitely loop while the others heal and so on. There we go, theyre now ready to block teh hook again after i outplay one of them and am about to complete my objective. Sounds rly fun.
---
wtf is that spirit though ü§©
---
thats actually really why i like playing wraith. he can still give some jump scares out. youve just gotta sacrifice some time by hugging walls. no one expects the killer to come from a corner.
---
"You will always get something rare or above when looting a chest"
---
Yes please... but I'm still stacking it with plunderers instinct
---
A minute is a long fucking time.  Especially in dead by daylight.  A ton of shit happens in a minute
---
I hope there‚Äôs at least one cosmetic that you can‚Äôt get with real money
---
When you go from giving Mori‚Äôs to giving Mortgages
---
‚ÄúThat is the scariest fucking thing I have ever seen in my entire life.‚Äù
---
Baby falls out of spitter 
---
*runs to safedoor and keeps pulling on it*
---
I did, scared I lost my progress lol
---
Don't forget Pharmacy
---
Hat to break it to you but death is not an escape.
---
Yes, that's kinda how creating a new character and backstory work.
---
Glad we agree on the balance.
---
Yuck fuck those green medkits I want purples and reds, I only get three chests
---
&gt;i'm wrong
---
Thanks for admitting it at least.
---
Except the ones that spawn on top of shit lol
---
I mean, if you use this argument, then Instadown add-ons, 5 blink nurse and all these stuff aren't toxic as well. 
---
I will clear out that I am not giving any opinion about whether it's toxic or not, just criticizing the argument.
---
I am the SENATE!
---
This is what I want to see in DBD
---
Scott jund comes to mind
---
We, evidently, don't agree on anything. If you have to try this hard to give a logical explanation, there is no logical explanation.
---
Nah man you gotta crack open those chests faster than a Nurse can blink
---
Buckle up is a crap perk by itself when you put it with other perks is when it‚Äôs awesome
---
The virgin gait vs. the chad stride
---
Surprised why everyone‚Äôs saying this is a bad shrine. It doesn‚Äôt stand out compared to some of the recent ones, but the only bad perk here is Vigil. The rest are all really good underrated perks.
---
Alert was actually the exact one I was hoping for, so I‚Äôm really happy I can get that now.
---
Thanks mate, love your work!
---
Would be only explanation, kind of silly with the left behind perk change.
---
Yeah I like the bun one. Only one that doesn't look ridiculous imo. Plus it fits with her Asian background. Looks great with everything.
---
Yeah, but i got it already :c
---
Pls give us PGTW. (again, cause i missed it)
---
Pretty much lmao poor ghosty just wanted a hug
---
Well in my opinion it would be smart to save shards to buy legion or clown so you can get pop goes or discordance quickly. Than after farming shards you buy the other character for the other perk cause discordance and pop goes can be deadly if used correctly. If you had to pick one I would go with legion to find multiple survivors on one gen getting quick hits in and also works for a pretty good tracking perk (just don‚Äôt level the perk up cause it‚Äôs more or less a downgrade making the alert from 8 seconds base to 12 seconds max slowing down instead of speed up the alert time.)
---
not necessarily. i don't really care about teabagging. there are other ways to be cunts.
---
*doubt* 
---
Still gets fat looped, his decoys would still be easy to spot, he still cant slow the  game against survs who can hit easy skillchecks. Walking decoys would no longer basically point to the survivor.
---
Plus, just make the walking decoys an addon, not base.
---
franklins is annoying as fuck for you survivors, I get that, but lemme tell just say, fuck survivors that switch characters last second to gen rush you without you being able to prep.
---
Happy cake day as well.
---
Honestly I'd take the perk in a heartbeat if they "nerfed" by removing the medkit part
---
&gt; Have you watched Otz?
---
[Have you?](https://youtu.be/vhhpvy04ng8?t=10m46s)
---
Helllllllllll no
---
‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre approaching me?‚Äù
---
ESCA-POOOOOOOO
---
Guess you could say he didn‚Äôt stand a GHOST of a chance against those loops
---
Not a fan of the killers that have side objectives, I.e waking up, taking the trap off, washing the sick off your face
---
&gt; pop
---
Yes. 
---
&gt;make your choice
---
I bought pig partly for this perk and... At first i thought she was good... then I got bullied. :c
---
On god i tought she had a ballsack
---
Idk what he is whining about. That sounds like every survivor match I play ever
---
100% hallowed blight look at hag's left shoulder
---
To be honest I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs infrequent as when a double BP event is on any of my free time that isn‚Äôt spent in game feels wasted because the BP I‚Äôm losing out on will be half the next time I play and I could‚Äôve just played more during the event and had free time for other things once it ends. It‚Äôs all a psychological time waste thing. Still I was happy it ended in a way.
---
Finally, another Hag main.
---
as a Clown fan i love this! so creepy!
---
On the contrary, if youre going for vault stops as doc you need to not run shock improvements, to stop a vault you need the minimum charge time (which add ons increase) and you need to be the right distance from them to bait a vault but reach them in time and the  base shock distance is perfect for that. This is all for loops btw.
---
Wow 10 seconds??? Noooo thanks man. 50 seconds, lower the speed, then we‚Äôll talk.
---
I don't get it.
---
It looks obese
---
Nah. The killer can do a grab on the survivor if they try to unhook in front of them  I went from a 1k to a 3k because of something like this before. Or another situation would be the survivor goes into potato mode or just happen to mess up their positioning mode and hit a wall while running. Or how about other survivors being dead or too cowardly do anything. A small chance is still a chance.
---
Are you genuinely so ass that you have to facecamp? You ought to patrol to bait the unhook and get two downs
---
Suvivors *play super toxic and tbag all game*
---
Killer *camp a little to try and secure a kill*
---
Survivor: caMpER
---
X
---
THAT BERET IS FUCKING WRONG
---
&gt;Lithe  
---
There is your first mistake! Everyone knows dead hard is GOAT :)
---
Ayyyyyyy she fat now
---
Lmao, this the first time I seen a Guy Code reference on this subreddit.
---
My main too brother, yeehaw
---
L1, just like the skill checks on the generators
---
As a fellow killer, camping after games are open is fair game IMO, I just find it much more fun to go after survivors, even if it turns a 1k into a 0k.
---
But it is only available once a match and can only be triggered when you are unhooked
---
Imagine not being able to counter Burger King Myers lmao
---
I smack the unhooked down to make sure the farmer doesn‚Äôt get a WGLF token if I can manage it, but I leave them slugged until I‚Äôve hooked the farmer. Seems like the best solution to me, and if the slug d/c‚Äôs then hey, sucks to be that team.
---
I think that's a confirmation bias..
---
If you actually look it up, you see as many, if not more, posts about the opposite
---
Just look it up about the daily noed posts
---
Can you give me tips on what tools I should use.
---
And getting tunnelled and having your whole game end in a minute reallllly sucks. DS is strong, very strong when abused during the minute. But it‚Äôs a minute.
---
I bought him on a sale for $2 to get BBQ and knockout. Haven't even played him.
---
It only works for between 40 and 60 seconds after being unhooked, pending on what level you have it (1 to 3)
---
Dbd Reddit: posts any meme with opinions on toxicity or balance
---
Comments: absolute terf war
---
I'd swap wraith and bubba imo
---
Lmao not my fault killer has 3 people to farm off of. Go be a cunt somewhere else:)
---
Knockout is all I need to complete the full perk set
---
I‚Äôm 6ft male, 235lbs and size 40 waist and the XL fits perfectly.
---
Bill gets a gun next update
---
I'm in love with the jake skin because that's how I always imagined that's exactly what Vigo looks like
---
LMFAO
---
I disagree with some of it, but i understand people have different opinions on whos stronger. Though I do think its objectively wrong to put plague higher then spirit and on par with nurse.
---
BHVR implied it
---
Swap spirit with plague or put plague at b rank
---
Spirit with mother daughter + prayer beads is S
---
Wraith can be powerful but without add-ons he is very easy to deal
---
Jeez what‚Äôs with all the hate on the hag main? People say killers rule the sub but I think a lot of survivors just lurk.
---
The nurse is probably the easiest to go against because you can duke her lunge piece of piss, she can't stop it when she starts, so when she lifts her hand run towards her and she will over shoot you and miss
---
Hallowed Blight Part 2
---
Bubba is S
---
That happened to me as a survivor on console. I just ran to the edge,  walked off and then was inserted back into the playing field.

---
Surveillance is super fun for gen grabs if you're playing a stealth killer, but the rest of these aren't great.  Knock out is nice for a troll slug build but that's about it
---
I love the anti-slug build, but even in that build flip flop is trash. You only ever get saved off of the unbreakable tenacity combo
---
I have...several issues with this
---
I think it‚Äôs bullshit that there are any made up rules at all, it‚Äôs simple, if I win I‚Äôm better if you win your better that‚Äôs what games are about not whining because I focus you, or because I‚Äôm camping the hook.
---
Me too, some people, smh my head
---
Never said that stuff was toxic? Don't see why people are getting so defensive over this lol.
---
Meant to have Plauge at A but Plauge is so under rated. Can make you broken and use you healing yourself to her advantage. Spirit is very good but takes a lot of skill and can be countered pretty easily.
---
‚ÄúRun up behind survivors and right click‚Äù as a billy main I am so offended.
---
I do t understand why you guys love dbd so much yet hate f13. They‚Äôre very similar games and both are buggy messes. I went against 2 killers earlier in a public match yet you all seem to write those off but the second a strand of hair floats for a bit in f13 you decide that the creators should be crucified.
---
Is that the spitter from left for dead 2?
---
Hey. Gg man
---
Aw Man the new killer perk: Gun, seems kinda OP
---
Meant for Plauge to be A. But definitely think she is very under rated.
---
I am a pro at F13 and have never played DBD but the world knows which ones in better condition.
---
Haha funi secks number
---
I‚Äôve always found it strange that tunneling is considered to be toxic, for example if I notice that one player is better than the rest I want him/her out of the equation first, what is the problem with focusing them?
---
But why actually win the game when you can sacrifice any chance of victory and give the T-bagger exactly what he wants?
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people find legion as bottom of the barrel I have a blast when playing as him and it‚Äôs so easy to find survivors
---
1. because you're off topic, you just are.. you're being dumb, then you throw another insult with the mental health. Fuck yourself
---
2. It's ok to be defensive when someone is attacking you
---
3. I'm 32, thanks for the third insult and no I'm not deranged, thanks for the fourth insult. Oh child abuse thing still huh, thanks for the fifth insult and attacking my past that you made up just now (Which never happened)
---
4. Thanks for telling me I need therapy, twice.
---
In conclusion all you've done here is attack me about six times and say I've been abused as a child and need therapy
---
This is called projection, I'm sorry you were fingered by your dad. Go see a therapist. 
---
You are wildly off topic
---
Yet you are on r/deadbydaylight and trashing f13
---
Whatever button is mapped to the skill check. Default is L1
---
Not really thinking of add-ons while making this. Just the basic abilities.
---
FeelsRank20Man
---
Well I prefer r/weed for a good time. The teir is you're friend made is inaccurate, but let him just learn more about the game as y'all rank up to be trley untouchable.
---
Some games are like that, some games you dominate, and others are balanced, it's how dbd works, the negatives just seem to stick out, and if it doesn't seem fun, just play survivor.
---
But can easily stop loops and if you know how to use your blinks then you become unstoppable.
---
Ok now I feel like a moron for some reason I was pressing r1 idk why. LMAO I‚Äôm an idiot sorry.
---
blorf
---
what really highlighted how underwhelming his power was when Freddy got reworked. They literally gave Freddy Clown's entire kit in his snares, and on top of that gave him like 5 additional benefits as well, literally making Clown obsolete even in the department where he's "best" at.
---
Easy to find them but his ability isn't very useful. Really just an M1 killer that can apply a little extra pressure.
---
So close! Read it again.
---
Plauge is one of the weaker ones in my opinion, unless survivors cleanse then your power is basically useless once they hit max infection
---
:(((((
---
Poor guy
---
Yep
---
Damn Spirit got me good. Just look at her hand :^)
---
im a baby killer but i main hag too! &lt;33 hag bbs rise up
---
He has eight fingers in his collection.
---
lol.. okay.. fair point
---
Haha! I never honestly paid much attention to that part of him‚Äîwhich is weird considering that‚Äôs what you watch the most when playing survivor lol
---
Your arguement of tips isn't correct though, pallet looping isn't a tip, it's a mechanic, nothing says, "Run around areas near a pallet to maxumize the usage of them," so it's not really a solid arguement, tips are just base things, not really the things that some people may not know, if it's in the tutorial there's probably a tip for it.
---
plague lookin like shit dawg
---
Not being rude you're just saying it how it is... And it is terrible... I feel the same way as you. There are indeed plenty of survivors who just don't do s**t... Thank god Survive With Friends exists... Always a chance for me to rank up...
---
we can only imagine, and i would want one for both genders
---
Yeah it's useless but they'd all be broken making it so you can one shot them.
---
You didn't, but that's a thing many survivors complain about as well.
---
#MercilessKiller
---
There would be no end to the post-game chat, since plays wouldn't need to rely on the killer as a hub.
---
Looks like a lag switcher or a game glitch is their spot where known lag switchers game tags are put on for display for the world to see so we can shame them. For the scum bags they are started to cut clips and post ing on you tube with thier ps4 gamer tag.
---
Fear no man lol, but do you fear women?
---
it seems like really terrible timing on the event honestly
---
Hey looks like you were right, posts like these don't garner any attention at all
---
That's why I carry BT.  I'm going to get my friend out the door even if it kills me.
---
Depends on platform for example pc is generally have long killer que but survivor is really fast. On ps4 the killer que is almost instant like I mean I look for a match and bam 4 survivors in like a minute sucks playing with friends tho
---
I was looking for jake in the picture, then i realized taht was NOT a new doctor skin, lol

The dev team is currently making a new game called "Death March Club". Which might be the Despair Road from Danganronpa V3 but turned into a full game. Maybe you should check it out?
---

---
We had to harvest the pustula plants, right?
---
Simple Killers like Wraith or Hillbilly come to mind. You want to practice your lunge distances and how to counter getting looped with simple Killers first.
---
No.
---
Yep but they're gone now
---
.....dont they come back on Halloween?
---
They introduce the meeting with a hella sexy ‚Äúhey listen‚Äù
---
If they are smart, they will develop the shadows into a killer or survivor
---
Is there a high quality version of this image exist? I tried Google Images but can't found. I want this as wallpaper for my pc.
---
Wraith can be powerful but other than the speed boost you get from uncloaking he doesn't bring much to the table. And I have Legion at F, I'm not saying he's bad, I've seen people do crazy things with him but overall he can't do much. The same for Wraith. Not saying he's bad but he's not awesome.
---
I would argue that *generally* empathy is better than alert. They aren't interchangeable really but they both tend to let you know where the killer is when he's in a chase. Alert has the added benefit of letting you know where he's breaking generators when he's patrolling, but Empathy's added affect of letting you see your teammates map-wide when they're injured regardless of what's going on.
---
Also I'd argue that alert is useless against a significant number of characters who don't usually break pallets such as nurse, spirit, legion, etc while Empathy is really only useless against myers *sometimes*, which it makes up for by being god-tier against plague and legion.
---
"The Council has come up with a verdict. The verdict is that this Blendette definitely has Dead Hard. If don't agree with this verdict, the Council will Hex: Ruin your life forever."

You have to double pip.

"Merciless victory "

Did you get the merciless. Because you can kill 4 people and not get a merciless
---
Lol
---
It gets some attention from those of us who would like unique perk diversity but yeah. It‚Äôs either wow cool clip!1!! Or Toxic survivors played the game!!
---
No, I decided that no matter what I say you'll continue with this illogical thinking. That's not agreement, that's me not wanting to deal with you anymore.
---
I have a relatively straightforward list of things I think the Trapper needs: 
---
1. Replace trap hunting with a Hag-like stock where setting the newest one over you cap just breaks the old ones (disarmed traps break).
---
2. Don‚Äôt make him stop to set traps. Either let him toss down traps without slowing that arm themselves, or let him pry them open using his hands while on the move and he tosses down the armed trap at the end of his channel.
---
That last point should apply to Hag, Demogorgon, and Spirit too. Everyone should be able to be on her move while using their power.
---
Tbf surveillance is good with surge

That‚Äôs why I am not talking about playing against, playing as is some of the most fun I have in this game
---
You can also purposefully reveal yourself to the killer through the perk.
---
e.g run in one direction for 4 seconds then turn around and walk/crouch into a different area. Pairs well with a delayed Diversion.
---
Well it's on generators now meaning you just gotta do generators no messing with flowers
---
The thing is though, the Hag's character info says "average."
---
being sweaty is different from being toxic
---
The under tongue thermometer ü§íhe chocked on it
---
Dude idgaf, imma talk smack regardless and call you a camping dirtbag, and then when im the killer imma play trapper and lay traps in gen escape routes and in front of hooks. Literally just played a match and waited till only 2 gens left and cycled between the two, and won. Good game. Im a cheezy feller
---
Hatch always spawns there lowkey, but if the hatch doesn‚Äôt spawn there I‚Äôm fucked lol
---
Surveillance is better imo
---
I agree but it was meant as a trade idea so we don't have to hear "omg i brought and lost good flashlight because demo"
---
Wraith can both be blinded and burned.
---
Hag can be both blinded and have her traps destroyed.
---
So maybe demo can be immune to blind but the flashlight could do something different?
---
Finally some plague love...
---
A mechanic that should be removed along with Moris. They both break the gameplay in a way that just shouldn't be fucked with.
---
Knockout offers you decent delay if you‚Äôre willing to slug
---
The Breather from Welcome to the Game.
---
of course it's a catch 22. you either are upset at being high ranks because it's unfun, or you're upset at being low ranks cuz it's too easy.
---
there isn't a middle ground, and there isn't a prominent solution as of yet.
---
it's never fun to play against someone who is beyond your skill level but, at least in my experience, most killers who derank are looking to have a chill or fun game. i cannot speak for other games and i haven't played overwatch in a year or two.
---
dbd definitely still has flaws with it's ranking and matchmaking system. and i rly don't know what they could do to fix it :/ sorry i'm not much help lol.
---
I don't know what I want out of this shrine, couldn't get decisive strike since I already spent shards on teachables from last week.
---
I don‚Äôt play hag cuz it‚Äôs stress me out, traps getting triggered and I gotta be everywhere. Not saying her power is bad, it‚Äôs good, just stresses me out.
---
Playing hag against unorganized randoms is some of the most fun I've ever had.
---
Playing hag against SWF on comms is some of the worst bullying I've ever experienced.
---
Clown and Spirit have the best cosmetics for the event, IMO,   really love the mask clown has!
---
Bad bot
---
The head on stun saves are always insane to see. God bless this perk lol
---
I loved that show.
---
Bruce is the man.
---
It gave me a chuckle, I liked it actually and wasn't trying to make fun.
---
Honestly I just assume in cases like that maybe english isn't the first language or maybe they have a different name somewhere else I've not heard.
---
I've been calling them plank barriers all day now!
---
That would be cool
---
Killer is a walk in the park because most survivors are awful at the game
---
Killer is a walk in the park because most survivors are legit awful at the game.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
---
I love the floating hair for looking like a disaster. Adds to her charm imo
---
Guess he wasn't tracking your scratch marks.
---
What the hell dies "short" look like then?
---
Oni Spirit, hot diggity!
---
More excited for cosmetics than the entire chapter which delivered; 9 perks, 2 survivors, 1 killer, and a new map? Makes absolutely no sense.
---
Yeah I'm not complaining about better people playing to their best, I'm talking about the people who see you after the game are a brand new player and tell people they're shit, or bad, or laugh at someone for being bad.  
---
I'm glad you're at a stage in your life where you can just
---
&gt;I play on console and have my sensitivity set to 50%
---
There's part of your problem. You need to set it to 100%, though I suggest doing it in increments so you slowly get used to it. 
---
Other than that try and take note of survivors looking over their shoulder or wobbling from side to side, they're the ones that tend to try and 360. Make a mental note of which way they spin so they can't do it again. If you're having trouble following them when they spin then you can try looking down a bit and backing up to try and keep track of them. Once you get used to the high sensitivity and keeping track of them it just becomes second nature and they look like fools spinning around uselessly.
---
&gt; Seriously who wants this map. Its a worse lerys.
---
For survivors or killer? 
---
I haven't played it much, but I think it's okay. What about it don't you like?
---
Those bullshit things Freddy puts down?
---
Yeah but then ur considered a hook rusher. 
---
Doing anything fast as a survivor makes you an "X-rusher" I guess
---
As a survivor main...
---
Yes but points are the only way for us to know why he didn‚Äôt double pip. And 26k is never a double pip. He needs to be close to 32k
---
If a killer is very close to downing a survivor, and they get adrenaline, it forces the killer to leave them and gaurd the gates. Adrenaline essentially guarantees you win a chase if it activates. 
---
Adrenaline is meta, and NOED is basically never used at high ranks.
---
oh no
---
Just watched ohmywreckers video. Didn‚Äôt know that you could crouch nor that you could destroy them with a flashlight
---
No it‚Äôs gauged by emblem score. You receive pips based on how you performed on your emblems, protecting gens for Gatekeeper, sacrifices for Devout, etc.
---
Perks are perks, nothing toxic about that.
---
All I can tell you is make best use of your time between fixing generators and hiding from the killer sure it will be tough but these indoor maps ain't getting easier.
---
Time to camp then.
---
This is why I literally always run BT
---
Surveillance is amazing
---
I like this map a lot.
---
A lot of the maps tend to lean survivor sided so I don't think it's  a big deal for killer to get one here and there.  Also as others pointed out Balanced Landing is fun on it.
---
Get in there ~~Lewis~~ Bubba!
---
I want to play as Emma Roberts against the new Ghostface, too meta
---
My camera randomly inverted and I tried looking down but it was going up it's an annoying bug
---
If I kill the obsession and lose Dying Light, but another survivor uses DS and becomes the new obsession, will I get Dying Light back with all the stacks I had before?
---
its already been confirmed, but the skins dont mean much, we got a summer banner, but didnt get a summer event, just the skins.
---
It must be done...
---
Bruh
---
I was in a match as a survivor, killer main here, and it was up against a Freddy. Not too bad because i main Freddy so I know little ways to survive him, but this one trial everything is going well-ish, 2 survivors dead, me and a Steve left. I know in my heart of hearts he has bbq because he immediately comes to you after a hooking. So what do I do anytime I think bbq is in play? Hide in a locker so my aura isnt revealed. Well apparently that steve didnt get the memo so he was in the room I was in, so Freddy hooks and sacrifices 2nd survivor, he immediately teleports to the genny right next to the locker I'm in. He chases steve around for a couple loops and then the steve comes directly to my locker, stops and points at the locker as he is being hit. THEN, if that wasnt already a dousche move he opens my locker making my character shut it on him revealing to the Freddy 2 feet away where I was then got downed. I was ripped out of the locker. He ended up getting away and unhooking me but I refused to heal him. He kept coming up to me and I wouldnt do it. He finally got downed and sacrificed. I ran into Freddy and just let him down me cuz I was injured and no way to get away from him, so I accepted death. Didnt wiggle the whole time I'm in his arms as hes looking for hatch, drops me few feet away, I'm a killer main i knew what was coming, he closed the hatch in my face and then hung me. Im the type of killer, if you show respect at the end and dont wiggle I'll give you the hatch, I dont like closing it in peoples faces like that unless they are about to jump in and I find them. Sorry, ended up ranting about the asshole Freddy lol but that Steve was a dick. If he hadnt sold me out I may have had a chance to get out of there.
---
Flair checks out
---
These skins are so good.
---
There's a limit for how many trophies one game can have, so they had to create a second list, "Dead by Daylight 2/2", which as of now, only has the Stranger Things DLC.
---
Freddy is good with weak addons as long as you got solid perks on him.  I usually just use browns on the man.  The Dream Snares are a little stronger but the Dream Pallets are more fun and easier to use.  I usually roll with those.
---
Ikr?
---
No offence, I'm really happy that you're in a place where stuff like that doesn't bother you, but " So it's on me if I let my non-peers upset me " that is not how it works, and it should never be how it works, you do not blame the person on the receiving end for being affected by it.
---
Not everyone is fortunate enough to have the same level of mental fortitude as you, and game after game of learning to play a game with higher ranked players calling you shit etc is gonna demoralise some people, does that make them wrong? Not at all.
---
I'm not saying better players shouldn't play as good as they can and win, that would be ridiculous, I'm saying better players shouldn't get into an end game lobby where they all have Purple Perks and Pink Addons and see a Rank 20 killer with no addons and 1 perk and go "ah yeah lets all call him shit and spam ez at him" (especially when one of their premade dc'd the SECOND I downed him) that's not on, that's the problem, and it's a problem in a lot of games, just bored of the "don't let it bother you" excuse, its old and its not helping.
---
fellow hag main here! it's what she deserves &lt;3
---
How about we all just agree to not be toxic and talk shit for any reason at all? 
---
The killer is justified to want to secure the last kill, and the survivors are also okay to not want to leave their last teammate.
---
Never? Why would it
---
Nah I'm a Nurse main on console and I'll have a bad game every once in a while where a swf escapes, it's harder than PC but you can do t
---
You realize the killers whole objective is to hook and kill the survivors, right? Why would we go for the full health survivor when they just unhooked their teammate? If you really hate it, run borrowed time
---
No frankly im not.
---
It would be great if tier 3 madness gave exhaustion by default, I've been bullied and abused by neas on lampkin lane too much.
---
What are you even saying. Freddy can camp the hook and even with BT you still won‚Äôt escape
---
Slow vault a locker and you can tell 100% if they have the perk or not based on where you see them go after hooking.  If they magically beeline directly to you especially if you're not near a gen they got it.
---
Yeah makes sense. And again I wasnt trying to brag with that in any way whatsoever just to clear things up.
---
Okay cool.  I have used spine chill, but premonition lets me see the direction they‚Äôre coming from. Doesn‚Äôt spine chill activate when they are looking at you?
---
Wow that spirit looks like a demon
---
Was this in the last 3 days?
---
Coming from the one who probably disconnects when found first or when getting outplayed. Grow up, that was the most pathetic excuse for a come back. You added nothing to the argument so your words meant nothing. You're probably butthurt that last game the killer wrecked you and have to take it put on other people like the 5 year old you are.
---
Yo what the fuck please tell me how
---
I've been DETERMINED to get it to work ever since I got Ash and I only ever got it to work one time in a custom game, while me and my brother were teaching our cousin how to play Killer

Just a lil bit terrifying
---
I don't know man..even tunneling and shit..you're a killer. If a person is near you, or is an easy pray...just go for it wtf.
---
Do they want me to heal them too? Or let them repair a gen while watching? As a killer i'm there to kill everyone no matter what right?
---
yes u will
---
Have you tried simply getting better at the game?
---
Depends. If you're going for a slow the game build, then Surveillance. But if you wana do a slug build, knockout. I use Surveillance on spirit, but on Myers knockout is amazing with tierIII.
---
Im new to the game, can someone please explain what tunneling is?
---
Corrupt intervention is a passable alternative, but I really would recommend just protecting your totems better, it should be the first thing you check every match
---
Huh, so that‚Äôs what happens when you close a portal on him
---
Camping isn't even fun IRL no way it's fun in a game
---
Killer skins for me seem to be more for intimidation factor, and that spirit one is perfect.
---
You literally cant win against a good nurse
---
What, killer v killer?
---
Just add TotH, you get alerted to survivors cleansing totems and it slows the game down even more, since more hex totems are active. I did a meme build of Ruin, TotH and haunted grounds so No one was on gens, they were simply trying to pop totems.
---
I have been seeing this meme a almodt exclusively on the dbd subreddit then anywhere else, not the exact meme you made sir, but I meant the format. Like almost every time I'm going through my reddit feed, one of the main things I see from the dbd reddit is the body/head of Mike wazoski having James p. Sullivans face photoshopped on the body/head. I'm not complaining, its just, just weird.
---
Update: no it did not fix. Still dc'ing. Oh well
---
Bro, he died 8 years ago. Did you know him personally? What grief are you saying my dude. I wasnt preaching shit it's a straight fact steroids fuck up your heart but I didnt even push an agenda I just said it does. I wasnt saying it could be avoided my man, I just said it sucks.

I unironically love running Tenacity and Flip Flop
---
Flip-flop, Unbreakable, Boil Over
---
If the killer slugs you, they might regret it
---
I didn‚Äôt recognize it because it looked like a shriveled old man
---
I think my favorite thing is when they say this sub is sided cause I see the same amount of bitching from both sides and it's all dumb as fuck and makes no sense
---
No you cant. I've clapped entire rank 1 survivor squads with her she's broken
---
The Council has found you guilty of being an infinite mending Legion.
---
Decisive bottle
---
Cool bruh
---
Really badass. Nice job!
---
Now it's still a bad perk that can be used to kill someone at the endgame. Do people really have a problem with Rancor?
---
This is why we run Blood Warden, no one realizes until its too late...
---
Respect for taking the time to cover their names.
---
Cant count the amount of totems I've found because the killer gave away something important was there early
---
Think of Adrenaline like this from the killer's perspective: you've got an injured survivor, a downed survivor, and one on hook. You're chasing one of the injured players, and the last gen gets completed. If the person you were chasing has Adrenaline, all of a sudden they get a speed boost, and it's going to take another hit to down them. The other downed person gets healed to injured by Adrenaline as well, and runs in for the hook save. The hooked person had Adrenaline, so they come off the hook healthy.
---
It may have appeared that you were in control of the end game, but all of a sudden, it's likely that these survivors will escape, or you'll kill less of them than you would have before.
---
It really puts pressure on the killer to get the kills before the end game, because if everyone is healthy and all that needs to happen for them to escape is someone to open a gate, it's very hard to get another kill.
---
I always, ALWAYS rock dream pallets. The giggle factor of chasing survivors torwards a fake pallet is worth everything. I will pair it with a paint brush, or something that makes them go slower at doing objectives while asleep.  If I could stack pallet addons I totally would, those things are so fun. Ive chased a survivor one time through a pallet spot missing a pallet, dropped a fake pallet there as we passed hit the survivor and they looped back around to the SAME spot and dropped the fake pallet getting downed through a spray of blood lol priceless.
---
Those things aren't toxic.
---
Boy is he in for a surprise when the Killer acknowledges the Hook's existence
---
Thrill of Hunt Notifies you if a Totem is being cleansed, at least then you'll be able to know where the totem spawned and react to whatever the survivors are planning to do.
---
Damn I just bought pig for surveillance
---
I similarly can‚Äôt count the amount of totems I‚Äôve saved because I checked them first thing

I had my devour hope spawn up on that rafter in that laboratory looking room, it was disgusting

Please don‚Äôt use self care. Honestly. It‚Äôs takes so long and you just harm the team! Being a med kit or bond. Way better for the whole team! 
---
I also can‚Äôt recommend ‚Äòwe‚Äôll make it‚Äô, enough! Amazing perk so your team isn‚Äôt wasting time!!
---
As a survivor, this is when those of us who run borrow time swoop in and save the day. Especially if the exit is close and we‚Äôre good at looping/evading. Face camping isn‚Äôt a 100% win.
---
Maybe I like the salt war that goes on between the 2 sides, it seasons my popcorn nicely
---
whats a lore expansion?
---
Ghost face is goddamn INVISIBLE on Ormond
---
Getting gen grabbed by a Non-Prayer Beads Spirit is a non issue. As such, Spine Chill has no purpose other than to counter exactly Wraith and Prayer Beads Spirit. (Spine Chill doesn't counter Michael and Ghostface any more than looking around does.)
---
Iron will is good vs spirit, but doesn't stop her from following footstep sounds and scratch marks. Also, the meta build for Spirit has Stridor, which directly counters Iron Will. Making the perk useless against the reason it's played.
---
Self Care is doo-doo. Especially with everyone running Nurse's Calling and/or Sloppy Butcher.
---
Dead Hard is good against every killer. Not a Spirit specific thing.
---
Great combo! That's why I bought pig like two nights ago smh
---
I guess she'd maybe be only a little shorter than Ghost Face, and it's just the weird slouching that makes her look short?
---
Yes! Yes she does!
---
But other Killer's need to be buffed first.
---
Nurse shouldn't be touched until the lower tier Killers are actually playable against 4 stack SWF.
---
If your on console the select button automatically inverts your sticks
---
Spook time boys
---
Hit your touch pad
---
Susie with her fucking broken ruler: I‚Äôm helping!
---
Best skin in the game
---
Agreed. I always pay attention to where the killer is coming from and generally start my totem search in that area. In most situations I found the totem in that location.
---
Pig deserves A or B, you're underestimating her like everyone else
---
What specifically about Otz are you looking for in a survivor streamer?
---
I never tunnel them or camp i play normally
---
 i usually just smack them on death hook and walk away just so they know that i know what they did
---
When I see no one coming I just set the controller down. If I reach struggle on the 1st hooking it ain‚Äôt worth it and I‚Äôm justifiably bailing.

---
we're not tunneling, how about you guys just stop unhooking survivors right in front of us
---
Meh, when I play killer I still chase the others, that's the fun in the game, is more fun to me and is more fun to them.
---
Are... Are you brown ranks?
---
Nowadays when 99ing gates is a thing, your statement could easily be "There is not a SINGLE reason for me to leave the hook once the last gen is repaired" IMO. Surv main here, btw
---
Use PGTW. The regression is very demotivating for survivors since there's nothing more boring than holding a button for 80 seconds and have the killer to take 25% of that progression away.
---
Quentin/Jake main here! I agree his perks should be buffed. He gets really unnecessary hate to be honest.
---
I have tons of those on Doctor.
---
Unless you're injured really the only way the Spirit can find you is Footsteps, Running into you, and scratch marks. If your really good at 360s they will work but become harder to do at lower
---
Well I'm definitely proof that the other way around happens as well. Play survivor a lot more but spend points on killers. End up fully built but going against like rank 17s as killer lol
---
Haunted grounds to fuck everyone who thinks they're clensing ruin :)
---
Ojomo is seriously the best killer though
---
Then when you say that T-Bagging is toxic people go full stop and say no it isn't. Even though it was done in Halo as a way to BM and its how people prove dominance over their partners when its done in real life.
---
People make up the stupidest shit so they can excuse their dumb behavior.
---
then why don't they put voice comm in the game?  It completely fucks up the balance of the game.  Or at a minimum alert killers when it's an SWF game
---
[TLDR: This is a 3 minute video on youtube that will basically show what I mean with gameplay](https://youtu.be/bNO4gPJ8WuY)
---
Yes, it does. The thing with premonition is, knowing what direction the killer is coming from is good, but that doesn't mean they are coming for you. Knowing if they're looking at you gives more info. If you hear a terror you might get off the gen. i.e wasting time. If you hear it but you know they're not looking at you, that means they are chasing someone else. Then you can commit to the gen worry free. It also hard counters stealth killers, and anyone running M&amp;A.
---
That's... not even close to correct.
---
It's hard to get them.  I'll see about 30-50 each tombstones/fragrant tufts/scratched mirrors for every lery's or game offering that comes up.  Shit makes me sad.
---
Now I can see why this game favors Survivors more then killers..
---
As a survivor main, I totally understand where you're coming from with this and I don't blame you. As long as you don't break any game rules, (not the ones from the survivor's book for killers *wink-wink*), you should play the way you want to play without feeling sorry or remorseful of what others can say about that.
---
Looking like lambent from Gears especially hag
---
That‚Äôs some terrible lag then.
---
It‚Äôs all the pain and tears from all of us who play the game... BhVR saved them up and found a use for it...
---
Don‚Äôt be a hero if you don‚Äôt wanna take the risk associated
---
You lose it 
---
You have to die with it in your hand I think
---
Idk I haven‚Äôt had that issue before
---
My 3 core perks on him are BBQ &amp; Chili, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Hex: Ruin. My fourth perk I kind of switch up but right now i‚Äôm using Dying Light. 
---
BBQ + Pop synergizes so well with his gen teleport that it just seems stupid to not run these perks. You can snowball really easily with these perks because you‚Äôll be able to start chases after hooks really quickly as well as keep survivors off gens while also massively regressing the gen. Hex: Ruin because it‚Äôs the best killer perk in the game. Dying Light because if you manage to snowball early it just gives you that much more of an advantage. 
---
As for his addons, he as a couple of good ones. If you want some serious game slow down his best combo is probably Red Paint Brush + Swing Chains. Survivors start in the dream world, can‚Äôt wake up with missed skill checks, and have a constant action speed penalty that increases for every survivor. This takes an ultra rare and very rare add ons though so I usually save these for matches I think will be really hard to win. My favorite add on combo is Nancy‚Äôs Masterpiece and Jump Rope. Nancy‚Äôs Masterpiece gives you massively increased cooldown on gen teleport for every sleeping survivor and Jump Rope slows down action speed on sleeping survivors (works amazingly with Dying Light). I‚Äôm not really a fan of his other add ons. The blocks are for the part useless. The dresses are also pretty useless unless you do a gimmicky build and combo it with Red Paint Brush + Huntress Lullaby. Class Photo would be good if you could still cancel your teleport but as it stands that‚Äôs too good of a utility to give up. As for his dream pallets, I prefer the snares. Being able to shut down/shorten loops is way more reliable than dream pallets. Dream pallets can win you the game if they work but if you get bad luck then they‚Äôre useless. Plus Nancy‚Äôs Masterpiece + Jump Rope is a combo I‚Äôm not willing to give up just for some fake pallets. 
---
One of the most important things to remember with Freddy is that sleeping survivors hear your lullaby instead of terror radius. Sounds minor but this makes it nearly impossible to track Freddy while your asleep. The best mind game to play on sleeping survivors while chasing them is to break line of sight while teleporting to a nearby gen so that you can pop out of nowhere for a free hit. You wouldn‚Äôt believe how many hits you can get on survivors running and looking behind them as Freddy.

That's the true question. MoM needs to be fixed.

I don‚Äôt even get what it does
---
He should get cosmetics on halloween tbh
---
Seriously if y'all want to go for clutch hook saves in my face by all means run Borrowed Time and give it your best shot. That perk exists pretty much for this sole scenario, so go for it. But anyone who complains about camping once the gates are open is out of their mind. I no longer have any objectives on the map to patrol but this one, so this is where I'm going to stay.
---
Idk about that scenario specifically, but I‚Äôve farmed in the past and chosen one because they ‚Äúget it‚Äù.  
---
Once I was playing and killed two, then let the other two farm. One Steve was with it - he understood when I shook my head, when to follow me, when to let me damage, etc. The other didn‚Äôt and opened up the exit gates before cleansing a handful of totems and maxing on some other BPs - so I downed and hooked him. I would‚Äôve let them both go but he wanted to do his own thing, so I did mine. The other I let escape. 
---
Might be an asshole move but yeah, you should always be on your toes when farming or if you noticed a killer &amp; survivor doing it.
---
they so good friends
---
Personally, I‚Äôm just gonna save for next week
---
Xeno is MUCH more likely to end up making a cameo apperance in the predator game, due to the rights being held by the same party, and simply due to being more fitting. Plus, its starting to sound like Dead by daylight pretty much has a waiting list of licenses at this point.
---
Yeah bring that bt so you dont get tunneled big brainer

Lol so true and I‚Äôve heard this from the same guy or gal who just hooked camped me the hole game from the start!

He or she stated this to me post game on PS4, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a rank 1 survivor who plays better than you, so git good scrub‚Äù
---
I could see them getting along...somewhat xD haha
---
Well, if im a killer, and i have the opportunity to kill the guy that has been teabagging and trolling me the first 5 mins and 3 gens of the match, thats the killers right. Is he giving up the rest of the match? Sure, but he is also a killer.
---
Once
---
I play nurse on ps4.  Its much less consistent and formidable
---
The addons that increase charge time also increases range, so overall it is more reliable than no addons.
---
Oh thank you !
---
I'm actually kind of new I just picked it up on switch
---
Anyone else missing Jane &amp; Ashley portraits?
---
I think it can only be used once
---
Ohh okay, thank you
---
I actually like the map. I'm a survivor main.
---
Old man Myers mask! That asshole from the movie should be holding it up in the cosmetics store as well screaming buyyy meeeee!
---
I play on Xbox so my experience is different than PC users.  I'd recommend just not using endgame chat to be honest.  I like that there are a few extra steps to messaging someone on console, and as a result most people seem to cool off before they end up contacting anyone.  
---
Honestly, the internet is trash and the anonymity problem online is well known.  Well, people are trash when they can be identified on Facebook too.  We all have to deal with this stuff in every area of our lives now, not just on a videogame.  I see your point, but I don't know of any solution other than getting rid of the chat on PC.  I don't think moderation by the devs is feasible and it's not a necessary feature, there's no "unfinished business" at the end of a match.  
---
Even in a game like Overwatch, people bully their own teammates and so on -- it has nothing to do with being competitive and everything to do with a power trip or aimless lashing out, usually by boys and young men.  I don't know a solution other than tuning it out, as we've been trying to improve young men for a long time and they remain shitty as a group.
---
Holy shit you‚Äôve been through a lot lmao
---
What! 200k from one game! How so?!?
---
It does if you are a die hard evil dead fan. I‚Äôm in the same boat as OP
---
Oh? You‚Äôre approaching me? Instead of turning away and running your coming closer?
---
One time. 
---
However, if you want, you can choose to not press anything and essentially save it for a later down if you anticipate being tunneled again. If you press anything though, it will count as failed and you will not get another try.
---
Why don‚Äôt mods pin updates and hot fixes? Like today‚Äôs one, for instance. What‚Äôs the point of having mods if they can‚Äôt even pin important information anymore and are generally slow? 
---
Yes, criticism.
---
I‚Äôve been having a ball with a few builds mixing it up. 
---
Prove Thyself + Better Together + Spine Chill
---
Kindred + Open-Handed + Bond
---
Tenacity + Unbreakable + Flip Flop + DS/Boil Over
---
Urban Evasion + Iron Will + Calm Spirit or Lightweight 
---
WGLF + Borrowed Time + Mettle of Man 
---
They‚Äôre not always successful but are fun to play differently. The aura build above may be my favorite. The Kindred killer aura range with OH is wonderful.
---
Interesting 
---
Seems like it would be good.  Any other fun builds? 
---
I thought about doing a totem build lol, could be fun with her
---
As a jake main I‚Äôm very excited. Definitely want that Steve skin too tho
---
The best spirit build is go fuck yourself and anyone who plays that abomination of a killer
---
Damn I really want OoO to be in the shrine
---
I think what happened here is someone (killer or survivor im not sure) was lagging and the killer was walking forwards and rubber-banded right after he past the doorway back next to that window.
---
That clown is fucking terrifying! I love it!
---
I love when that happens
---
1.3 actually
---
You will lose it. If the killer has Franklins and you bring a white ward just make sure they grab you out of a locker while you‚Äôre holding your item. You won‚Äôt drop your item and you‚Äôll keep it when you die.
---
Because... she‚Äôs viable at high rank and against well optimized swf? 
---
Fuck nurses as well? 
---
Grow up mate....  cheers
---
Saaaaaame. It was my favorite event so far
---
Spoiler tag please
---
This is why K have my Tapp as my perk slave while I freely prestige everyone else.
---
For the long haul get BBQ and chili as fast as possible. If you don't like leather face get the teachable. You can do doctor like the other guy said. Wraith is good too because it's easy to get the first hit. But really just BBQ and chili on w/e killer you find most fun. Fun is more important to me than fast
---
Use the lettuce head and the bloody body with bloody claws and you‚Äôll get a super saiyan hag
---
It said rank progress -1
---
The dying light rework might make that a suitable alternative.
---
I'm not saying he's bad but compared to other killers he's not very good. Really just an M1
---
I main nurse and i play meta perks.
---
I was talking about the show lol
---
Points also indicate how well you done in a different way meaning they‚Äôre still not invalid as I am not claiming they‚Äôre based on the same systems at all just that high score means you done really well and if you‚Äôre within 3k of the max you definitely hit Merciless. This is after extensive testing on my part, so sure you can do it with less score but since he‚Äôs only at 26k he didn‚Äôt reach it. Without the other screenshot this is the only way we can inform op that he wasn‚Äôt merciless.
---
Who is that
---
Cosmetics instead of an entire chapter? Ridiculous
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and it seems very smooth, especially after today‚Äôs hot fix
---
So there is no solution to when I'm injured?
---
Distortion, Babysitter, We'll make it, Solidarity.
---
It is entirely possible to max out at 32k points and NOT receive a Merciless Victory. The only consistent way to measure your performance in terms of pips is with emblems
---
Alot of people consider being facecamped as a win
---
Very carefully
---
&gt; They have a perpetual victim comple
---
Imagine being this un-selfaware.
---
Frank most likely pissed it off
---
This is adorable. All that‚Äôs missing is Spirit to complete the Ghost Trio
---
It‚Äôs a free kill if he just stands by the hook
---
Typically if I run rancor it's for the survivor positions when a gen gets done
---
If anything it occurs more for me now. I‚Äôm playing as Feng, running from the Hag and all of a sudden I come to a complete dead stop. Hooked, and killed. It‚Äôs been going on for me for months now.
---
&gt;!Gonta killing Miu made no sense at all!&lt; 
---
&gt;!not to mention how cringey hard the writing tried to make Kokichi another Komaeda!&lt;
---
Also Monokubs were fucking annoying to the level of Will Ferrel and JC Riley's Sherlock movie and the whole love hotel thing was just a brothel of fanfiction.
---
Hag mains rise up
---
Which basically makes the perk useless, 99ing the gate is going to give no problems finishing it a majority of the time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
BW really should proc when the gates are powered if you get a hook and just be on a delayed timer until they're opened. (I'd even argue that you should be able to proc Blood Warden more than once, perhaps without overlapping their timers - meaning one has to expire before the other can even be procced, meaning you'd have to proc it four times to cover the entire EGC since it's slowed from 2 minutes to 4 minutes when you have a survivor in the dying state).
---
That's actually highly unlikely. It's suppose to be solely a Predator game, not an AVP game. Those have already been made. No reason why a Xeno would make any appearance in it. It wouldn't really be all about the "Predator" at that point, now would it? 
---
I bet the Xeno is on that waiting list you mentioned.
---
That sucks. I‚Äôm spooked because I have been playing dbd for a long time and this is the first time ever I get this offering.
---
Most killers don't consider those perks as toxic
---
:( yeah that would be me. I'm a new player and I kind of enjoy trying to use her but I'm never very good. I just love the idea of her traps scaring people though.
---
removing spirit would be the best idea instead of skin :thinking: that's what she gets for this month!
---
Just saying it's pretty easy getting to a high rank in this game
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad you played trapper against a toxic SFW you resisted the urge the change your build to counter them which may be stupid, but at least you tried.
---
well Hag ends chases incredibly fast so you‚Äôre trapping incorrectly
---
More points is a 4k, which is much more likely when you take someone out early
---
That would be lovely - and I‚Äôm thinking this as a survivor player. 
---
I would panic and be stressed with moving hallucinations. 
---
Awesome
---
Same! And it becomes an anti-tunnel build if you pair it with breakdown
---
Yeah, that's what I imagined. He seems like someone who likes to push people a little too far.
---
You‚Äôll lose more often with that mentality.  Good survivors get tunneled and camped a lot. Therefore, they run ds. You will waste your time tunneling a good survivor and you will lose.
---
All the female survivors besides Meg and Jane are probably too weak to lift it.  Most males, except Dwight, can probably carry one, but I would imagine only Steve, Jeff, Ash, and Bill can with one hand.  Only Bill and Ash have a decent chance of throwing one at the killer and hurting them, but the killers have the entity‚Äôs protection and would most likely survive.
---
I had the misfortune of playing her against an swf in "the game" map a couple days ago. Shit was brutal. I might have gotten two hits total.
---
Unfortunately against the survivors you're talking about, your skill doesn't matter. A 4man SWF on discord, with insta-heals, and brand new parts are the *power role,* **not you.** You have a few choices.
---
* Get good with nurse or spirit. 
---
* Keep playing pig and risk getting shit on.
---
* Play pig after rank reset, and once you start getting these games again swap to nurse/spirit or take a break until next reset. 
---
I know you like pig, but she's a joke to these types of survivors. As someone who plays both sides I can assure she can only do so much, **don't** blame yourself.
---
As for rank... It's weird, I've gone against gen rush squads at rank 17, and potatoes at rank 6. At the end of the day, hours and experience matter more than rank. I've been rank 1, but i don't play as much as before, so I can't hit that it much anymore. But my skill is still here. So all rank 1 means is you play the game everyday. (which doesn't equal skill)  
---
&gt; After a day of racking up tilt I broke my good headphones
---
0_0
---
Double Bloodpoint Event, BBQ, Gruesome Guteau, 3 Bloody PARTY streamers from survivors. Was about 200-210k
---
Yep, she's a screamer alright
---
Literally no one has ever said that doing gens is toxic.
---
I like the add on that increases how long the phantasm stays too. Can actually pull some neat mind games with that
---
and again playing nurse , spirit does not mean you are toxic ... you just wanna play dbd on easy mode that's about it really.
---
Sorry to hear that. Still hasn't dc'd for me and that's the only change I've done.
---
What the hell? Spittin *fiur?*
---
NOED still works, my experience with Inner Strength is that there are always 1-2 totems that are hard to find (never lit ones though). I've also been playing with Detective's Hunch and some are REALLY tucked away in weird places that I have to wander around and find even with having briefly seen their aura.
---
Naturally 99 Hex totems out of 100 are glaringly obvious in position, and they are NEVER in the weird/obscene places, at best they might be tucked into the cubby of a hedge or something on Badham.
---
Thankfully there's information out there on how to learn killer. There's also lots of high level killer streamers that go over perks and how to use them. Game sense will come as you clock in more hours and learn the maps and loops. I would stick to a few killers you like and start building your bloodweb to get the perks that you want. Also, don't worry about your ego or feeling bad about your play. A lot of people have thousands of hours in this game. Unfortunately, the game doesn't really offer much for training wheels. You just get thrown in there and learn as you go. You'll improve and games will be a lot more enjoyable. Good luck!
---
Last year Hallowed Blight started around mid to late October, so that'd be my guess.
---
*Skkrrt Skkrrt Reeee Reeee*
---
The killer chases you exclusively until you are dead or the game is over.
---
omg yeeessss next art piece
---
I feel like 5-6 months back I used to run into Myers all the time, now I almost never see him played. Sucks to cause I find him fun to play against.
---
I‚Äôm not saying never give them a skin, but if they wanted to give one to someone free, i‚Äôve heard a lot of people are playing Dwight and Meg right now so those would be better options.
---
DS is toxic, can't change my mind.
---
Any chance at one with Wraith, Susie, or Huntress? Or even just more in general!?
---
Really wish they had done Jake and Meg to finish out the original 4 survivors.
---
Except the doctor gives madness, so beefing up one of his not so good abilities would be a good way to fuck with survivors heads and make them think they're about to be chased but it's all in their head
---
Fair. I just never seen anyone around running Jake. It‚Äôs always Claduette and Laurie and Feng but no Jakes.
---
You've slowed your game down...
---
A dishonored skin for nurse would be cool
---
Inner Strength isn‚Äôt the only reason NOED is a bad perk, but it‚Äôs definitely an incentive not to run it
---
Aha right. You have the black Guy as a slave
---
Yeah i see the rework its pretty good now and follows bhvrs trend of giving characters 1 stronk perk and 2 trash perks which you throw in the garbage
---
Well a Killer can be bad and still have a power that isn't very interesting to be caught against.
---
Especially since LF can miss or hit the window and still down you with the resulting tantrum (especially if there is even the tiniest bit of host latency) while Hillbilly would just miss. I've only been downed once or twice against a Hillbilly who struck the window (impact sound and everything) first.
---
Add on to the fact that his chainsaw can hit you twice even if you get Borrowed Time and you really wish Bubba got a different power entirely.
---
I know, right? Like, do I seriously have to derank to play something else other than Nurse, Spirit and Billy? Myers is just too much fun to play against. 
---
I seriously invite all killer mains to play more as Michael Myers. You can even mori me.
---
This is the only one i've made so far, but i'll work on some more if there are good sources! I'll message you when they are done
---
Nice
---
m'clownie boy
---
I got ya. Yeah I try to be situationally aware enough to guess if they are coming toward me or are just near me. Like when starting a match I‚Äôll work on a gen and if premonition triggers I‚Äôll go hide, but if it triggers when someone just got injured I know they likely aren‚Äôt going for me. Spine chill has no cooldown though!?
---
I play hag without ruin
---
A piece of advise, leave the best for last, go for the easy targets, when the good ones go for the save, they‚Äôll make a mistake, that‚Äôs when u get them
---
Fatal act of violence? That removesnhalf the roster of survivors and maybe like 2 killers.
---
He got a lot more fingers in this skin
---
It is always worth it to just break chase and leave survivors alone for a bit to rebuild your map pressure, the worst thing you can do as Hag is just start chasing survivors with little to no traps setup.
---
This is a big mistake people make with most killers in that you don't always have to just blindly chase survivors, a huge chunk of the killer cast is more powerful when using their power to catch survivors off guard or hit them by other means.
---
YES, you know those stats they show at the end. Item lost, item gained, etc etc...
---
I see Ace Attorney, I upvote. It's as simple as that.
---
The glass is there, it‚Äôs just really hard to see against the black background
---
You can't "learn how to improve" against someone whose power boils down to "Do some mind-games and also down the closest injured person for free"
---
Hi dad, i‚Äôm dad.
---
That how I find out if their good or not usually, how they handle those situations.
---
If you're seriously trying to argue that Bubba's power is too strong or unfair, then please stop. He's a terrible killer. And either way, it countering borrowed time does make me bad for using it, or make him op, or anything else, it just means he has means to deal with it. Just like killers with Undetectable now counter Spine chill and stuff. Im failing to see your point, its intresting to be caught by Bubba's chainsaw because its so bad that he needs to make strong plays to land it. Its not intresting getting hit after the 4th blink on a nurse. Other then Nurse, I feel every killers power is intresting and cool. Legions they nerfed away any amount of uniqueness it has.
---
What‚Äôs a safety pip
---
The one thing we Clown mains always wanted, his bare belly.
---
looks like the render isnt' complete. the hair isn't "hair" but just the polygons used for it. like the hair texture is missing. so it's a partial render?
---
WAH!
---
It is. However, the way they talk only the god tier of god tier survivors make it to rank 1. Which makes me sus because the only survivors I get in red ranks make me question if there even is a God sometimes.
---
i don‚Äôt care
---
yeah, no cool down.
---
I mean, if they don‚Äôt make mistakes at that point u could drop the chase and try again later when u have more pressure on them team-wise
---
These "leaks" have to be on purpose by now. I swear its just a weird marketing tactic
---
I play him he is very fun especially when you get used to his tier mechanics
---
...just a little bit
---
Vommy mommy is best killer
---
Please do so. :)
---
I‚Äôd use it
---
I'm survivor as well with some killer here and there to understand mechanics, maybe we can them up some day!
---
Of course. Go all out.
---
Halloween Clown and Plague? ;; Yus please.
---
Yup I love when they send that "camper" message at the end, like what else are you supposed to do not play the objective for a kill? Lmao
---
Jokes aside while I'm happy with the leaked Halloween skins ~~except for Plague because wow her skin is lazy~~ I am rather disappointed that we didn't get a new Legion skin, as Legion is now the only original Killer to not have a Hallowed Blight skin. What's more is that we got 2 less skins this year when compared to last year (5 instead of 7); one less Killer skin and one less Survivor skin. I think they could've easily given Meg ~~because Meg needs more skins right? 4head~~ and Legion skins to round out the total to be equal to last year as well as give us a Killer skin for all the original Killers and a Survivor skin for the four original Survivors.
---
What really ticks me off is that a quick search into various creatures in Canadian mythology presents a lot of really awesome monsters they could've used as a skin for Legion. We people up north have tons of ghost stories, sea monsters, as well as monsters in the forest. In particular both werewolves (Huntress' HB skin) and the wendigo (Wraith's HB skin) are both iconic bits of Canadian mythology that they could've explored with Legion but seem to have already done.
---
I'm just saying: sea monster Susie, ghost pirate Joey, werewolf Frank, and wendigo Julie. It would've been awesome to see. But at least I can give people fucking nightmares with Clown's jack-o-lantern Joker-ass face cut smile.
---
There‚Äôs only one killer in the entire game worse than legion, of course they aren‚Äôt getting any Halloween skins
---
What's so ridiculous about people having their own different preferences?
---
Can tell you factually that there are far more Legion players than Clown players, and this is coming from a Clown main. ~~Who granted also plays Legion.~~

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dc50m1/is_there_any_reason_to_buy_leatherface_on_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
But in that case, you get the (admittedly minor) penalty for letting someone die on the hook, again punishing you no matter what you do.  The issue here isn't that the killer wins when one survivor is on the hook and the other gets found, the issue is simply the unnecessary additional penalty to the rank.  You are already punished by simply not escaping, which costs you at least a point, maybe two depending on if you've gone down before, so why get punished again for unsafely unhooking someone who was condemned to death anyway?
---
Instaheals aren‚Äôt that bad, ( I have no main, but I play killer a little bit more than survivor) when people instaheal I just either drop the chase if they r good or try to hit him again
---
Reminds me of how that one cop ended up in the new Halloween.
---
Personally for the people who say camping isnt toxic, I mean realize that the person you camped loaded into a match, got unlucky you found them first and now wasted a whole match without any chance to play. "Its a legit strat bro" sure but it's still toxic. You stopped them from being able to play that match at all. Not only do they get no bloodpoints, they depip which is hardly on them and they lost a good 10 to 20 minutes of their time which was supposed to be for them to have fun and you negated that. 
---
Not to say it's always bad, if gates are open then go for it. At max they lose three minutes and that's because their team is being stupid, not on you nor them. Also if they were being excessively toxic by tbagging and flashlighting and pointing then go for it. They basically asked for it. Just a punishment for them. 
---
Basically, camping without reason just ruins other peoples games. Its not fun and actively looks to make someone else have a bad time which is personally what I would consider toxic. Everyone here just wants to play the game and enjoy themselves and negating a whole game for someone doesn't do that.
---
Is this including or not including addons and perks
---
If you unhook someone and they get downed within 15 seconds of getting unhooked, you get a pretty decent penalty to your altruism ranking.
---
Kinda what it dies in the show
---
What perks do you use?
---
I wish there was legion. But pretty dope jake
---
I usually stack my wglf by sticking to the back of whoever is being chased (while they're injured so I dont look like a dumbass and die) or bodyblocking while the killer is carrying someone
---
This art is fucking sick. It‚Äôs something about falling action poses that gets me.
---
He‚Äôs so awful so no
---
Ok, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that this post is ‚Äúthe best part‚Äù which includes both the killer and survivor experience. 
---
You challenged that and I disagree. Plenty of killer builds are stupidly fun, but suck to play against as survivor, I wouldn‚Äôt call it the best part of a game if only one side is having fun

I see! So it's not so much an issue with _strong_ Killers but rather an issue with Killers that break the gameplay loop and throw a wrench into the core of the game?

That‚Äôs just the game we play. There should be penalties in thy situation, because you lost. You have to decide which penalty you want. Either you‚Äôre penalized for a teammate dying, which you can counter balance by winning the final stand off, or you can make the hero play, risk it all, and be punished even more heavily for failing. It‚Äôs all about Risk vs Reward. There would be no reason not to hook bomb if there was no risk associated with the potential reward
---
Don‚Äôt worry OP, I only play Myers so I got you.
---
I had a game where I ran the killer around for 7 minutes to get his first hook. We did 2 gems in that time. He chased the 3 other guys and got them on their first hook all within 30 to a minute of their chases starting. All of us were rank 2, it was a spirit. You just get bad teammates sometimes, while other times you just gen rush and they don‚Äôt even get one hook.
---
The killer got bored with chasing me. He spoofed on me after I dropped a 3rd pallet in front of him. I just found it amusing I was 1 off.
---
That's when you stoop to their level and burn a mori.
---
Spooks on the spooktober
---
Doot.
---
They need to do something with the rankings. Too many people at red ranks that don‚Äôt deserve to be there.
---
The killers dont complaim about the survs doing gens is the charges of this what is wrong 40 seconds per gen is stupid

Funny that you think your Borrowed Time does anything besides fuel my raging boner for STBFL stacks.

I want the heartbeat and the dramatic music when Trapper appeara to be replaces with Stayin' Alive by The Beegees.

---
Potatoes in a nutshell. I'm not gonna lie though, I suck at ruin skill checks, I can hit 1/4. So it will take me a little longer but I can still get it done. But to make up for it I can loop for 40Secs-2Mins.
---
That will include the licensed killers?
---
I think it's a combination of it being to easy to rank up and ruin being literally necessary for killers past green ranks
---
Oh there's 4 now? I thought we only had 3? Neat

What's wrong with Scratch Mirror Myers?
---
Oh yeah I  don't immediately pallet break, but when I need to it gets a bit annoying that in that time they can manage to run the length of 6 football stadiums. I know insta breaking pallet isn't always a good idea, I'd just use it so that when I do have to, it gives them less time to run away. Usually if it's a close pallet I take advantage of pigs long lunge, or ambush faking (switching direction mid charge) , but on maps like autohaven or plague's map, thats not always easy.
---
It's not too uncommon for people to say "You're going way faster than normal!" When I'm Myers. I honestly have no clue why.
---
I don‚Äôt think thats how you use this meme but ok
---
Tunneling is specifically targeting one survivor.  They can leave you on the hook, but they drop anything they're doing to chase you down and eliminate you.
---
Lmao now I see what you mean.
---
This is just a really bad buckle up
---
Frankly clown is worst. Worse cool down, low to begin with, the list goes on

You teabag to taunt. Taunting someone is the definition of toxicity, or at least bad manners.

Worst place in the world, Hawkins, Inidana. I havent represented the mind flayer in years, but the teenagers wont give a shit

Just had this happen with me a few minutes ago with a trapper daily for chasing 180 seconds. I got 177 lol it sucks I feel your pain

That ended

They decided that you‚Äôre a potato
---
Vroom vroom, I am your doom!

I play both and rn I want to play survivor and it‚Äôs pissing me off
---
I almost never play Clown (not enjoyable at all to me) but I have to admit that skin looks amazing.  The face is soooooooo good.  It makes me want to want to want to try to want to like him lol.
---
Thank you! I appreciate the feedback. I‚Äôm hoping to redo it at some stage. :)
---
Well what I meant was, a really good nurse or spirit can absolutely destroy any enemy team, because of how insanely effective the killers are when used well. Also I've been watching them a bit, and I've also been watching a pig main named scorpions to try and pick up on things they do.
---
That sucks, I guess you're double glitched then. It shouldn't be doing that.
---
I‚Äôll post some pics when I get some at the con! My partner will be Dwight as well. :)

Adiris my love!

My name is HOV. H to the O-V.
---
Feng Ming and Dwight are beginner friendly survivors.
---
They are not equivalents. Adrenaline rewards survivors for playing well. Noed rewards killers for playing badly. 
---
As killer you can play well, do your objective and kill everyone before adrenaline can activate. 
---
As survivor, by doing your objective and powering the gates, you give the killer an insta down. Sure, do bones. 
---
The real equivalent survivor perk would be, something that automatically unhooks and heals a survivor if the killer is doing well. Stupid as that sounds, thats what the equivalent would be
---
Didn't check the subreddit and read "Baby Killers" and was genuinely concerned as to what the meme was about.
---
Ghostface's would look awesome, make the mask his *actual face* and blight it, so his eyes and mouth are yellow.
---
I love the art! Just one minor detail, since I worry about art thieves. That marking in the bottom right corner is way too easy to remove. It‚Äôs best to put your mark in a significant part of the art, so it makes it harder to steal.
---
My head canon is that Killers would fight each other so the Entity only allows one killer per trial this just makes it stronger lol
---
ya those lumps of puss is a no from me
---
When ever i get killed by a nurse i admire the killer as its the hardest killer to use it requires alot of skill.
---
I haven't seen that, but distressing can make some sense in that you can't hear the whoosh if you're in the terror radius
---
I like that you choose the black to be your slave high five dear member of the kkk

Kinda dumb question but I just got the Switch version and noticed the quality is.......not the best. I tried looking in the settings but I can't find a quality prompt. Is there a way to imlrove it or am I SOL?
---
There's no outplay in scrath mirror + lab
---
I wouldve been excited for it, but then the KYF glitch happened, and spoiled the fun a week early.
---
Nurse's Smack-o-Lantern mask is great tho
---
Oo yeah, does make sense
---
Hagatha has a wonderful red dress what do you mean? AND SALAD HEAD
---
frick what is the name of the song
---
I can't pallet stun you without getting closer.
---
This has been an issue since DAY FUCKING ONE.
---
What pisses me off more than anything, is the ONLY reprive I ever got from this kind of bullshit "mechanic" were "vacuum" pallets, which was legit in my mind just the same exact "glitch" but the other way around, where I was closer to the pallet really, just like I was closer to the window really, or whatever, and it would instead kind of work out in my favor this was.
---
I say "kind of" because unlike all of the killer mains on reddit, I understood that when I played Survivor, I'd STILL GET HIT THROUGH A VACUUM CONSTANTLY.
---
So they basically fucking ruined pallets and now I get hit trying to drop it AND if I drop it, AND once I'm sprinting away from a window, etc etc etc.
---
It's pretty horrible honestly. I've always wondered if Dedicated Servers were the answer, and maybe they are, but they'd really need to reverse the pallet shit to get us back to normal, if it is.
---
Holy shit we finally have surveinllance!
---
fuck the other 3 though
---
I like it
---
Your argument doesn‚Äôt make sense. There‚Äôs a difference between perks and strategy decisions. Perks and items aren‚Äôt toxic, but a strategy can be.
---
I swear to fucking god, I opened it up thinking it was a fortnite banner....I was completely thrown off gaurd
---
It wouldnt work sadly, I really like the show and stuff and I think it would be cool but it wouldn't make sense lore wise, and they would need to make new animations, which would be to much work
---
Depends on the specifics but usually you lose it, you need to be carrying the item for it to be protected, so if you are pulled from a locker, grabbed from a generator or get downed with a power you can keep your item cause those don‚Äôt trigger franklins, but if you get hit with franklins and die you lose the item even with a ward
---
Are you actually on Reddit trying to tell me there isn't a Hitbox/Cosmetic dept at BHVR????!? (which of course is separate from the "Hitbox Cosmetics" dept)
---
I wish it'd take 3 minutes for me at red ranks for survivor.
---
I'm gonna start playing Clown now just because of the skin
---
They changed the matchmaking system a while ago so all killers can get games, before some killers waited 20secs and for some it was 40mins. Now it's 3-7mins for everyone.
---
I‚Äôm trying, I‚Äôm trying.
---
Bring plunderers instinct and ace in the hole to play the chest slot machine
---
awesome thanks!
---
Well, I mean, being a trapper you don't have much of a choice. Since your not the best at pursuit unless you have a minefield anyways it also has the added benefit of making them feel cocky which leads to their demise, as you mentioned
---
When your injured you make more noise, leave blood trails, and can be downed in one hit so it might be better to run than take the risk of walking. I don't know how you took that as you can't counter the Spirit while injured.
---
This makes me want a Special Infected killer now
---
Yes. Every survivor and the killer can hear it. It pretty loud.
---
I mean, alt-F4ing isn't hacking
---
More likely it's just how much *work* she is to play. I enjoy her, but get mentally exhausted if playing her against good survivors very quickly.
---
It's a super fun map, and so is lery's?
---
I mean... Its always a better idea to attack the UNHOOKER instead of the HOOKED player. If you go instantly after the hooked player and continue chasing them if they have bt that‚Äôs tunneling. Its definately not camping, and its not tunneling if you attack the unhooker. Besides, attacking the unhooker is much safer anyways because you have no risk of bt or ds. But I guess?
---
If I can have a possessed puppet for a hand, why wouldn't i be able to have a possessed actual hand?
---
Unless they change his Mori again for this specific skin like they did for Ashy Slashy. :(
---
Thats not at all what I said. I'm saying if you tunnel 1 survivor because they are good then you will lose the match. Thats why the made perks to combat tunneling. Its not the intentional way they want you to play. But go ahead, tunnel 1 survivor because they loop you well. That method will not work for long
---
No just the No Father, but the No Mother and No Children too
---
It was really just a joke of the perks from left to right
---
Fair enough
---
You could argue Clown to D in my eyes but his gas can really help to stop
---
You got outplayed deal with it. Baby survivor has no reaction time lmaoo. Demo destroyed you.
---
I run no mither object and dead hard every game... Try me :)
---
The Demogorgon is probably going to win, knives probably won't be any better considering the Demogorgon is bulletproof.
---
Nurse is slowest, Hag is same speed as Huntress. Spirit. Plague, etc
---
You should do traps in the very beginning.  Hag is honestly top tier enough that you shouldn‚Äôt generally even need Ruin.
---
Never slowed me down tbt. Just made the tears in my eyes for no reason seem more vivid
---
You make a good point about the animations though. Although if it looked good, I'd probably pay as much as a full skin for it.
---
3 minutes? That's faster than I've ever gotten into a match as killer
---
Maybe it would work if it didn't have new animations but then, if course, how would it work for the lore?
---
I dodge cunts like that. I can just watch youtube while I wait for a new one.
---
I've gone from 0 kills to a 4k so many times with doctor this way. So damn satisfying. When I'm survivor I always leave through gates ASAP. Every man for himself
---
Yea, because long walls with pallets don't exist. Most of the "unsafe pallets" on this map are next to the entire wall sections and some of them have the slightly-opening doors. There are also those places with higher places and window drops. Tier 1 Myers is not fast enough to deal with that.
---
You just have to hug those and you're untouchable.
---
This is the easiest way to lose your totem immediately.  You're better off ignoring it initially and heading away from it to throw them off, it'll last longer more often than not as result.  Besides if they really spawned on it and discover it that quick when the game starts it's gone anyways.  So many of them are in a partial swf group and just tell teamates anyways.  If it's not them someone else gets it.  The ignore route causes mine to last a lot longer.  I'll usually wait a minute or so before I head to it and i disguise that as a gen patrol.
---
I had the absolute least fun I've had in a match facing a Hag a few days ago, but that said she wasn't camping or anything bad. I just got unlucky, hit the traps she set up, and got hooked three times in the first two minutes. I only got 2k gloodpointa during a freaking blood hunt. 
---
Totally proud of this person for getting their 4k- they pipped and everything! Their gameplay was solid once they got the first person down; I was completely outclassed. 
---
Good player. Cool killer. Totally glad I don't see a lot of Hags.
---
The gas applies a slow effect whenever a survivor is in it. If the Clown is smart he should be able to end the loop.
---
You‚Äôre right that‚Äôs not what you said, that was my bad but allow me to clarify, I meant it as more of a general statement because I get tons of hate mail from this game. You might be right about tunneling survivors but it‚Äôs not like I do it constantly, when I do however I never chase them for more than a minute or two this may just be because I‚Äôm low level though.

Hag is def a killer if I saw a lot of, I would hate to play survivor lol. I can go 100 games without fighting one, then see her in the distance and think ‚Äúoh GOD it‚Äôs hag‚Äù
---
I usually leave the hook to bait a save or to try to down a survivor attempting to lead me away if I think I can get them. If I only have 1 kill I‚Äôm probably going to depip, so I‚Äôm going to try to get more kills and risk losing my 1 kill since it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway. Also makes it more fun for survivors
---
Against high rank survivors that know most totem spawns by heart, I find much more success beginning my match by setting up my area of control around the section of the map containing my totem, I can usually patrol it easily while also patrolling gens
---
Everybody is so nice to me when I play killer, they know I'm a baby.
---
Wow is pc that bad I‚Äôm at red ranks
---
noed is whatever... Ruin is too op imo, but so are gens. Here we go... Gens need to take longer and ruin needs to be removed. Ruin is one of the ONLY perks in the game that ALWAYS does something. even if that something is waste cleansing time make survivors look for it. ‚ÄúJuSt HiT sKiLl ChEcKs‚Äù I hear you say, well it doesn‚Äôt progress the gen at all when I hit a great with ruin, which therefore slows down the gen more due to me not getting the added bonus percent from the great skill check. Is ruin toxic? No. Its a perk in the game... Use it Idc. but it definately needs a nerf and please for the love of god devs stop nerfing survivors and survivor perks so much and just please nerf gens and ruin thanks. :)
---
-a no mither ace main :)
---
I‚Äôve never been hit in the gas
---
Honestly yes. Some of my best moments are being mirror meyers and playing against it. The jump scares are just so much fun
---
I literally did nothing this one game except sit on gens while my one teammate BMd this Hag. So their argument was to BM me for no reason. She slugged me until my timer almost ran out, placed traps around me, let me crawl to hatch, close hatch in my face, swipe her hand at me 1000 times, hook me and stand in my face and their argument was that a COMPLETELY other person was toxic towards them so they felt to need to be a dickhead to me. Killers make me so much more mad compared to toxic survivors.
---
They‚Äôre still gonna do it, just to fuck with you usually. At this point it‚Äôs more a meme than anything
---
THIS MADE MY JAW DROP OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
---
Against organized, coordinated teams, you're only going to have 0-3 traps out most of the game until you decide you have to chase the designated flashlight clicker and trap reporter/remover. A high skill looper will just wait for you to trap a loop and then abandon it (reporting where it is for removal later). This is similar to how Trapper is countered, but Trapper has normal movespeed so it's easier to fake people out and catch them before they reach the next loop.

How so? The Demogorgon left when Steve, Nancy, And Jonathan attacked it because it was confused at wtf was going on. Plus, in the last episode of season one it was able to shrug of getting shot at by multiple people with

This means you wont lose all your progress on an account if you change your name?

What about the vile pruge i also have
---
Its all good. Ill figure it out eventually. Worst case i wait for dedicated servers
---
Oh hey I remember you from that game!

They will end after a certain amount of time to free up server space. Otherwise people could just afk in the endgame lobbies, which will flood the servers
---
You don't lose your progress :)

If you‚Äôre gonna complain about Head On instead of DS or Adrenaline or Flashlights, well you got a serious problem buddy
---
In my 48 hours of playtime, most of which being survivor, I've seen 0 plagues on NA xbox. Kinda makes me want to buy her
---
I'd be fine with it procing more than once if it deactivates if I down another survivor. 
---
I don't like to tunnel, but it's really frustrating when you switch targets, down &amp; hook someone else, the first guy dives in for the save, down them and get DS'd because somehow the game still believes i tunneled them.
---
Is this the goosebumps music
---
Annnnnnnd id shit myself.
---
F
---
"Did that fucker double book us again!?" 
---
Its like the entity needs to get a better scheduler.
---
Sorry, late to the game here on this. What glitch?
---
It wastes time for survivors, which is very useful for getting into more chases per game.
---
The problem is that the survivor has to carry an item for it to work. Hell, he might even say "fuck it" and leave it there.
---
i think they actually just added higher pitch and a fountain of autotune to waluigi's voice
---
You hit your touchpad bruh lol. Happened to me and I was confused as fuck too
---
when I just want to pip up, I'll run sc, dh, we'll make it and bt. It's a good all around build, that's slightly more focused on altruism.
---
I've literally sent those 2 pics to everyone yesterday
---
Sorry to say it, but you might be where you need to be. Bad teammates can screw you over quite a bit, but if you‚Äôre doing a little bit of everything you should have no problem getting pips. Green ranks are pretty rough in my experience
---
Time to get it then. :)
---
Cool
---
Ok, so around a week before *Ash* released, going into *Kill your Friends* (now known as *Custom Game*) showed all perks avalible to use, even ones you dont have. (KYF isn't competitive mode)
---
However, they accidentally added Ash's perks on it. So we all knew Ash was coming before they announced anything official.
---
I really cant believe how many of you posters actually like the way spirit looks. Her face looks horrible. Absolutely horrible.
---
It‚Äôs the only exhaustion perk that helps you out even when you‚Äôre exhausted. Being able to jump off ledges, hills, dropdowns etc and hit the ground running pretty much straight away is huge and the added speed boost is nice too :)
---
I thought that was Jeff for a minute lol
---
If you REALLY want the bloody cosmetic, yes. If not, no. If you don't play the game daily ESPECIALLY no. The bump in rarity isn't noticeable or worth it at present.
---
That said, if you are going to Prestige, do it BEFORE putting any bloodpoints beyond rank 50. It's also a good idea to store up to 1 million bp before you Prestige so you can get them back up in rank asap.
---
His lungs BrOkE
---
That shit looks cool. I seriously want to see all 4 legions in one match. That would be so cool.
---
1:1
---
Wao... you must be using those free AOL internet discs they used to give out in cereal boxes. I cri for you.
---
That's not the same as doing gens
---
When you get the 666th vote üòà
---
Four legions and instead of trying to complete Gens they have to slowly bleed out the other killed but the other killer can down them pretty quick in a direct fight, ideally it‚Äôd probably be someone like Billy or Leatherface.
---
Both games were in development at the same time, and after the initial roster more characters were seemingly copied from Paladins by OW than vice versa. Characters like Sombra Bridgette and Ashe.
---
Yeah, you should really do the opposite. Doesnt matter who is gen jockeying, always gets done at the same speed. It's the chases that matter, in which case, if you want to get someone out of the game, tunnel the worst player
---
For real dude, I think you could still set something up. I‚Äôm not an expert or anything but...
---
feels like it should've been a longer time ago
---
Legion is bad but cmon, F tier? Hes atleast D or B also billy is A or S tier at best.
---
Exactly! What about the useless stuff like the DS ‚Äútimer‚Äù for killers. Pretty sure I can figure out what happens without that useless icon.
---
Yeah, and getting stabbed multiple times by teenagers powered by Linkin Park with knives is probably gonna do some serious damage. Not to say its a definite win for the Legion, but they have numbers and communication, while the Demogorgon really only has strength and durability. A solid plan and some good teamwork can take down anyone, just look at Thanos (fucking Star-Lord).
---
This would legit be an awesome fight to watch
---
Doctor with BBQ and distressing.
---
BBQ gives double blood points if you can hook everyone 
---
Distressing gives double blood points in deviousness, his shock therapy is in that category and insanely easy to use.
---
Even in my worst rounds I usually pull 20-30k and it's not uncommon with offerings for me to get 50+
---
The teenagers don‚Äôt win this. Even with gunfire and several melee blows the demogorgon couldn‚Äôt be put down for good. 4 tens stabbing it won‚Äôt kill it.
---
Or play dbd on I don't want to have to rely on survivors to screw up to win mode, really
---
They should have gone with David and Jake for survivors skin. It's disappointing to only get one survivor skin.
---
PWYF on Legion yay or nay?
---
This one took me so long to get as well. Felt terrible just using BT to insta save people off hooks to get it but geez. Now I just gotta get the 4 man hatch escape to be at 100%...
---
To be honest I think all of the other Killers hate the legion more than the survivors. I'd like to thank between trials the other killers murder the legion numerous times.
---
They don't belong and probably enjoy annoying the others. Either way my bets on demogorgon.
---
What settings do you guys use to 360 on PC? Is it better to use higher or lower sensitivity?
---
Maybe you accedently switched?
---
Eh we can agree to disagree on this but I think we can agree that if all the killers fought Myers would undoubtedly win
---
No, had hag on my screen the entire time but when the map loaded in I was nurse

---
Facts
---
If I'm ever against a hag it's always a hag main that destroys me lol
---
I personally always go after the person going for the unhook as their unsafe hooking habits have intentionally thrown their ally under the bus, and I don‚Äôt want to tunnel down someone just because their teammate wanted to farm them.
---
Very true. There‚Äôs a big difference in say a survivor who manages to slip away from you at smaller loops cause he‚Äôs experienced, versus the same guy running straight to a ba window loop the entire match and flaming you for not being able to get him.  Abusing the best gimmicks on newcomers is just mean, but introducing them to what they will eventually have to counter is just part of the game.
---
Grazie Ragazzi grazie mille grande machina grande lavoro
---
What? Do your chain hang low do it wobble to the floor?
---
Spirit ate too much McDonald's
---
And then you will complain at the end that the killer camped and your teammates didn't save you. Sometimes there is need to save the hooked person while the killer is nearby ( when the killer is known to camp, you almost reach struggle state/ die etc.), I suggest you just improve at looping to discourage the killer from chasing you most of the time or punish him if he decides to chase you. Or even run DS if you feel like you need it.
---
Care to explain how?
---
But toxicity is generally something that actually causes you distress or genuinely upsets you, if someone tbagging can do that you need thicker skin
---
LOL me too! Zoomed in first time and everything til I read the comments
---
I mean if all 4 survivors die on first hook ur getting a black pip/maybe 1 pip and nowhere near as many points as a longer game would have given
---
That's both a yes and a no. Most killer perks that reward extra bloodpoints also have a second powerful function. 
---
Survivors get like one BP perk with a bonus function. Otherwise you have to waste a slot to farm more BP.
---
That's kinda bullshit imo.
---
Hook camping seems to be a valid strategy. If you're dumb enough to run out and save someone the second they are hooked, calling the killer a camper is not the right move. A killer is wasting map presence by watching a hook. So if a killer gets a 4 kill because of hook camping maybe they aren't the baddie.
---
This is definitely an interesting idea, I wonder how it would turn out in practice
---
So just destroy all survivors entirely and make every game be a 4k, cool.
---
or how about you always have a terror radius because the killer is proximity camping....BT or not somehow u need to be saved
---
I am trying to get comfortable with Mr. Ding Dong and learn the best way to use his add ons. 
---
I obviously like the Coxcombed Clapper, Swift Blood Hunt and The Ghost the most. 
---
Any suggestions on which add on combos work best for you?
---
I didn't read the title and I thought this was Persona 5/Stranger Things artwork that had taken some serious liberties with the MCs
---
probably not but I imagine thats what the killer looks like as they try to make sense of this madness
---
Just did not want to spend viewers precious time.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 1 player and I can tell you, ALL PERKS CAN BE USELESS AND ALL PERKS CAN BE GOOD. Alright now, who cares about perks, just play what‚Äôs fun and hilarious and enjoy the damn game :)
---
I mean, while not meta, it's all DLC perks, 3 of them are licensed/money only DLCs, so I consider it a good shrine. 
---
In fact, the only perk that isn't really useful is Vigil, but it completes 'walking buff' meme build (prove thyself, leader, streetwise, vigil).
---
There actually is a counter. Pull them out of the locker before they come out or bait it. This scenario he could have simply not walked straight to the front of it lmao
---
Understandable
---
Found the killer main.
---
I'm actually really surprised they didn't give David a Victorian pugilist-esque skin with a closed up trench coat stained with pustula juice. Could've been something like "Vigo's Bodyguard."
---
It doesn‚Äôt do much most of the time, especially when someone teabags in every opportunity.
---
Some teabags at key moments (like hitting a window after someone vaults even tho it looked like a hit or getting autoaimed into the wall) can add onto the annoyance tho.
---
She's a spitter.
---
Adrenaline is mostly meta because of the Insta heal, with so many slow down perks like sloppy butcher, thano, dying light, it‚Äôs better to spent that 30 seconds healing on the last few gens to get that insta. 
---
Adrenaline is definitely the better perk overall, but noed is never used at high ranks because killers are able to apply pressure to slow the game down and end chases in red ranks.
---
Wow, new Meg skin when?
---
It was fixed in the latest patch
---
Why are you comparing 3 very small hunting knifes to a spiked baseball bat. Not to mention one of their weapons is a broken ruler
---
The ones that let you break and vault things fast are really good cuz you can start to uncloak at the pallet, and they'll throw it down sometimes, and then you can break it really fast without uncloaking. A go to add on is anything that makes his reappearance time faster because uncloaking is really slow.
---
I've only used repair slowing/stopping perks like that for adept. Not necessary. BBQ was just a topical example. Whispers and even spies from the shadow are better than ruin.
---
Unless you run dead hard
---
Hope just feels better outside of the situation where multiple people are slugged with 1 gen left
---
Equivalent would be old ds, get out of jail card that rewards being downed and punished the killer for doing their job.
---
Congratulations, you juked an obvious baby nurse.
---
That's like posting a video of a killer destroying a harmless baby dweet.
---
It's just the objective bro. You're trying to bait the Killer to chase you instead of your allies. It's the Killer's fault for falling for the bait you're not being toxic by specifically trying to piss the Killer off. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_///¬Ø

I've watched streamers do the "MoM challenge" where they try to unironically proc MoM at least once a match, and they have to full on throw the match for a small % chance for it to proc. And every time it's ready, they're just about at the exit
---
No i just dont wanna be a hypocrite, i dont wanna be facecamped at any point, so im not going to facecamp someone else at any point, its really that simple
---
sounds shit
---
*Clicking flashlight
---
Long list of garbage.
---
Doing gens is not the same is doing gens.
---
Hmmm yes this floor is made of floor.
---
Jane thiccero obviously beats all the 4 original survivors
---
80 seconds. But yes I do agree.
---
Its always bugged me that when mikeys tier 3 the knife isnt up in the first person view
---
Ah nice. I do, yeah, so part of me says why bother. Why would I ever not be Scoops? :P
---
It's her face or a mask?
---
I wonder if he saw the ad in the paper he was writing for
---
Good job!
---
I think that that is what a lot of the people here don't comprehend. I can't imagine face camping is fun in any scenario but with exit gates open you really can't do much. I would still walk around the immediate area but I'd stay very close cause I want something out of the match. But honestly some people here play toxic but claim they do it because others play toxic. If the killer or survivors in the match you are currently playing in is toxic then you have an excuse, but let them start it, otherwise you are playing like an ass and blaming people who aren't there.
---
Wasn't a baby nurse but okay buddy, be rude for no reason.
---
Right, annoyance, but they arent forcing you to go for them all game, and if you let it get to you and you play worse then they just succeeded in their goal, if someone tbags at a window, thats time they could have spent getting into a better position, most of the time its easily punished
---
You should NOT save when the killer is camping. The correct play is to ignore the hook and do the gens.
---
During that one camp you can do all the remaining gens and escape. That‚Äôs how you punish campers. By trying to unhook you‚Äôre playing right into their ‚Äústrategy‚Äù and keep trading hooks instead of doing anything productive, and also make sure the killer gets a pip after the match. Good job, you rewarded them and made them camp more in future matches.
---
Imagine spawning as a Surv haha
---
The new Spirit cosmetic for the upcoming Halloween event.
---
And in 3.0.0 double blades exploit was brought back, and it also worked on all action speed (including vaulting)
---
The only minor change I'd make is give Meg the flashlight over Dwight, since her perks are more focused on boldness. 
---
Very great work!
---
Have fun destroying your hands.

My friend consistently gets a value of 0 for survival points at the end of a trial, even if he is the last one alive and completes quite a few of the ways to get points in that category. Why does this happen?

This was such an awful idea, I can‚Äôt understand how they thought this was a good idea

Alert sure. But vigil? Yeah it's awful

Wonder if the plague will spew up that bright goo?

Gen rushing ‚â† doing gens.
---
Gen rushing is doing gens as fast as possible, brining the best perks and items to help you, while actively avoiding everything besides doing gens. (Prove thyself, adrenaline, resilience, brand new part, engineers toolbox) That means ignoring healing, getting out of chase as soon as possible, unhooking at the absolute last second, and if someone is enough of a dick, bringing a key so the survivor's don't even have to open a gate.
---
Best thing that happened to this game is the devs  adding head on and Jane romero
---
Thanks man, I spent a lot more time on the shading than I expected, but I think it turned out well.
---
I Iove her hair too. 
---
I‚Äôm wating for the day they make her hair look like actual fire! Could have been this one but, alas, my wait continues.
---
:clown:
---
People downvote for stupid reasons - ie people not liking tunneling because it can ruin the fun of the game. Imo anyways. The people down voting me are likely the same people who dislike BT and DS... Which are perks created to counter that type of play style. Perks I don't have to worry about.
---
I mean, the dude I replied to said it was idiotic to play any other way. Implying his way is the best and most logical way to play, but it just isn't. He shouldn't be dissing a smart way of playing. Sure you can tunnel, but to me it makes me feel like an asshole and there's a chance they run D-strike or that they've been affected by BT. That shit is annoying and drags the game out just as long as hitting the farmer twice, but if I chase the farmer I ain't gotta worry about perks.
---
I go against SWF a lot and I never really have issues in chases. Mind gaming most people isn't hard, if someone gives me a problem they are obviously the "runner"... So I ditch them and chase their team instead. It's all about priorities and learning when to ditch a chase. I almost always get a 4k. When I don't it's usually cause of the hatch or because I take pity.
---
I never have the issue of getting a 4k and getting barely any points because 4 or 5 gens are still left. Extending the match is important.
---
A good way to know is to look at your perk. If it lights up that means it‚Äôs activated. If it darkens then it‚Äôs not. With that said, I‚Äôm pretty sure if you are looking at the group it will not activate
---
I maxed out my first p3ed survivor and they're my go to. That way I can p3 everyone else and not worry about playing them without the perks I want. I have 13/19 prestiged so far!
---
Fixed as well. It was fixed in the 3.0.1 patch when they buffed Ghostface. Nothing else has been mentioned in the recent chapter notes, so unless something new pops up, Double Blade Legion is safe to use.
---
Y'all are forgetting about Demogorgon's regeneration. After he was burned alive, got into the bear trap, got few hits from Steve with his bat, he was ok few mins after. Plus, he can take legions into upside down 1 by 1 till he kills them all.
---
Ugly bitch!! Im getting this skin
---
You need to do gens in order to gen rush. Henceforth gen rushing is doing gens.
---
A square is a rectangle but rectangles aren't squares.
---
What about solidarity?
---
Okay, so no one said doing gens was toxic, they only said gen rushing was. That what I said to begin with...
---
Why don't you mention super awesome hag?
---
C'MON, WHO'S WITH ME?
---
Well when I dc'd it was so I could derank to play with my rank 20 friend. During every single match I'd play them out in their entirety to give everyone a nice fun game and they get all the bloodpoints even the killer and then dc the last millisecond so I still get a -1 instead of getting a +1 or +2. So if this happened to me it would be very dumb since I'm not abusing the system to actively fuck everyone over.
---
If QTEs are destroying your hands you need to see a doctor, you have a serious medical condition.
---
Permanent is little to hard just for a DC
---
On a side note, I love how the Doppio meme format made it to this sub lmao
---
I couldn't care less about an escape when I've got over 3850 in total, I'd rather get points and max out characters and die rather than escaping with 10k points and 0 stacks.
---
Nay, you realistically only want PWYF on killer with a way to instadown or another way to conserve stacks, two good examples would be Bubba and the trapper.
---
I mean... well yeah
---
IMO unless you're doing it for a safety pip you're a dick in my eyes. Camping someone just to say you got one kill to me is just pathetic. Either way you've lost 1kill or not. The camping part to me just says you can't effectively get kills. I'm no mastermind rank 1 killer player either but it doesn't take all that. Just switch your perks till.you get something that works for you instead of camping 1 person so you feel good by saying at least I got one.

borrowed doesnt work when the person whos unhooking is asleep. and if you're asleep, his lullaby doesnt count as a terror radius
---
They were just bad sports I guess
---
Exactly
---
Isn‚Äôt that bonus only working on self-heal?
---
I believe both his, and my original point in the post is talking about optimal, game winning, "becoming a better player" type mindset.
---
If your goal is to farm BP, by all means farm away.
---
The game actually can differentiate between a person clicking the leave button and a person who‚Äôs game just crashed
---
It's a bad term. What people generally mean is that generators are able to be completeled too quickly. Most survivor mains will use it as a straw man stating it's their only objective.
---
me trying to do trapper dailies
---
How would it work
---
Yes.
---
But you realize what you were doing IS illegal and bannable right?
---
Only time Im gonna unhook without BT with the killer nearby is to prevent 2nd state or death hook.
---
Spirit is the S tier buyable with shards, but Hag is also a good buy if you don't have Hex: Ruin teachable yet.
---
If you're looking to tier whore out, that is. If you're looking for fun, that's pretty subjective.
---
Haha it made it even more satisfying.
---
Maybe
---
It‚Äôs still listed under bannable offences on the support page. You might wanna check it out mate just to be sure.
---
And what about people that altF4 or simply close the software on their console instead of clicking leave?
---
Yes, illegal, the cops will come after ya
---
*None life is precious*
---
this is pretty much just as bad as pre-rework freddy with dying light. don't be surpirsed if people suicide on their first hook, no one wants to play against a no-heal, double mend time legion.
---
Plague isn't scary at all, it's one of the main reasons I just don't like her.
---
Not all the time
---
And the people who dc against hackers?
---
This is actually really good
---
It‚Äôs her face warped that resembles a mask
---
Well, all I can say is, don‚Äôt get hooked? Heal up to get rid of Thanatophobia? Or gen rush. Or just rage quit. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Claudette, self heal is still on of the best perks
---
That‚Äôs different. If survivors are just throwing themselves for a rescue while you‚Äôre still right there, you are guarding/preventing not camping.
---
I shouldve clarified, which survivors from the DLC should I level up first lol
---
There is a limit to Inner Strength, there is none to Botany Knowledge and Self-Care. You also won't always be able to find a dull totem, especially if you need healing multiple times or there are multiple people in the match using the perk or totem hunting.
---
Wait is it supposed to be blenderette or like something else im lost
---
I levelled up Nancy first because I really liked Inner Strength and Fixated!
---
2k = win. You don't need spirit or nurse to get consistent 2ks.
---
I rarely get hit with Noed since i do totems ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
---
Seen this before but the locker makes it amazing
---
IDK, try looking at the first example?
---
1. Unlock Enduring, playing an M1nner without it is asking to lose
---
2. Don't respect pallets
---
3. Don't overchase a single surv (also never follow into any of the large buildings, they're all unbeatable.)
---
4. Don't kick gens unless they're 99
---
5. A downed survivor still applies pressure and you don't waste time hooking, if you can see another surv after downing someone, just slug them.
---
6. Learn basic mindgames, ScottJund (DamnNoHtml on YT) made a guide for all generic tiles.
---
*Happiness Gurgling*
---
I'd like to argue that going after the unhooker is almost always the best option. The unhooked person is less likely to go on a generator for a while, additionally, borrowed time and especially decisive strike will waste a lot of your time. Even if you just happen to run into the unhooked survivor and down them, you're better off just leaving them on the ground and look for someone else, slugging applies a lot of pressure, you don't risk getting DS'd as a bonus. And if they already used their DS, there is even more reason to just slug them because it means they are on their last hook. Yes, if you hook them, then you have a survivor out of the game, but there is no additional pressure if you hook them because they're dead, if you slug them, other survivors get an incentive to move their ass, they might even get desperate knowing it's their allie's last hook.
---
I won't deny that tunneling is sometimes the best play, but I rather just try to build as much pressure on the survivors without ruining their fun.
---
Clown has better teachables.
---
Nah
---
You are so on point tbh
---
&gt;It feels like there's some sort of power complex going on and the Survivors don't want to lose it.
---
Especially this part, being bombarded by survivors PM's all the time I had to block communication. Something killers never did once, even when single handedly destroyed them
---
I think you got pretty much most of the things correctly tbh. It's sad there is such devise, I'd rather have people work together towards a better experience but since it's a 4v1 game, survivors tend to see the killer "the big guy who ruin our experience" instead of a human being that's playing to enjoy the game
---
Which leads in toxicity towards killers and this cause the killers to be douchebags because of past experiences like that and the cycle continue. The killer, aka the bad guy, kill them, they get pissed and play aiming to ruin killers experience and so on
---
It's sad but true. Especially when the timer is so strict and you have almost no power over it making the game way more stressful for killers, making them quit the game entirely or play survivor more (like me and many others). You can always rely on other people even playing solo while as a killer it's just up to you, if you fuck up even just once by doing a bad call you can lose the game. If you fuck up as survivor, 3 other people can help with that
---
Fixated is pretty fun, if you feel like using 2 slots if you use distortion and babysitter you can see the killers aura and they can't see you and you give teammates no scratchmarks or blood trail for a bit. Second wind and Fixated need to be buffed though. If a blendette shows up when you're at 99% of healing someone the perk second wind doesn't work because you yourself have to finish an entire health state and when you're injured fixated doesn't let you walk 20% faster.
---
It would be cool if Legion skins had their faces resemble their masks. Frank and Julie without their eyelids and lips, faces looking like drawings on their masks. Susie with a massive poorly stitched scar across her face.  Joe's  face is just gone, as if it fell off from infection, revealing his actual skull. All injuries are oozing with Entitys honey.
---
Also fuck you I play Clown.
---
Survivors don't have to do bones but are still allowed to complain about NOED.
---
Is the blender on the left called a claud
---
no.
---
Yes I agree. Which is why every killer main before agreed that they would love to take out noed if ds got removed, but once ds got gutted didn't mention it ever again.
---
are you trying to make my joke unfunny or do you not get it, its hard to tell
---
You need to remember most people will be around green ranks and not necessarily understand or think about all the ins and outs of how to gain points effectively and split pressure by having multiple survivors injured, thinking that just making sure people die by any means necessary as fast as possible is the best method is something that the game should warn you bout, youll have quick games but wont get as many emblem points or bloodpoints as making games extend a little bit
---
Zombie:
---
Base movement speed: 3.86 m/s (96%, nurse's movement speed)
---
Terror radius: 16m
---
Power: When you hit a survivor, they get infected. After 30 seconds they die and become a zombie.
---
Perks: 
---
Hunger: Your craving for brains compells you. Each tier of Bloodlust activates 3/4/5 seconds sooner.
---
Rot: Survivors are repelled by your stink, disorienting them. Survivors within a 8/10/12m of you periodically make a coughing sound.
---
Paranoia: Fear that others might infect you drives survivors apart. Whenever one or more survivors are 4m or less from each other, skillchecks are 40/50/60% smaller. This effect does not stack.
---
If it was 10 it wouldn't be an issue and you wouldn't be saying I deranked to bully after reading my comments that obviously show not being a dick.
---
Or maybe he shoots through the barrel
---
Skyette
---
Yeah those are fast moving zombies but you're neglecting all the other points
---
Sorry forgot the "not" before bully the killer, there is a shit ton of those People and rank reset makes it even worse of situation
---
Seeing survivors teabag is almost as infuriating as when people say gg ez. 
---
You've already won, no need to be a douche canoe about it. All your doing is inspiring toxic killers.
---
Usually because I'm too busy getting an Ebony Mori ready
---
no idiot its "pictureofacloudintheskyette"
---
Feels like all killers run ruin these days. Hardly ever see devour tbh
---
Or Chris Walker imo
---
Yup. I just blacklist such tards and then crush them with ebony nurse. I also don't forget to nod&amp;ggez in the end.
---
Is legion considered bad now? Did he get nerfed?
---
I made a mistake recently of believing I was outplaying a killer.  In truth she was farming me for stacks and by the time I realised it was too late
---
I do like Urban Evasion
---
Yeah I hate rank reset when it's like that.
---
So just for using NOED, I'm now being toxic? Its a perk in the game, are the developers just toxic survivor haters for making it then? I don't understand this.
---
From my experience people usually just do SWF and one person has OoO. Permenant every survivor always knowing where you are. Pretty bullshit.
---
Negan from AMC's The Walking Dead. His mori could be a masterpiece
---
Ah damn you got me
---
Otz is like the toppest bloke in all honesty
---
People complain NOED is too strong even though the best killers and killer mains don't run it, and is only seen on new or bad killers, according to survivor mains. But Adrenaline, the meta perk that's commonly found on every other survivor, or very realistically all survivors in a game, is totally fine and balanced.
---
The ability for survivors to get off the ground because someone else did a gen, get healed and guaranteed escape because some else did a gen, get a speed boost on top of that - that's okay. But the chance for a killer to insta down someone once the gates are up? 
---
The killer has to give up a perk slot for a chance to have endgame comeback potential. It is not guaranteed in the slightest even if it does go off. It can reward bad play, but pretending that Adrenaline doesn't do the same thing is a bit silly. If you're injured and about to be down, or slugged as the killer is trying to down a second person, someone else doing the objective rewards you, who were in a bad position due to your own poor play or good play on the killer. 
---
Adrenaline is an insanely strong perk and that's why it is the Meta perk, not NOED. You can shut down NOED by cleansing totems. You can only truly stop adrenaline by literally winning before the perk can activate. How is finding and cleansing totems equivalent to the entirety of then killers side of the game? The killer is expected to completely outplay the survivors just to stop the perk from activating, which as survivor mains are quick to point out, is not realistic. You shouldn't expect a 4K every game. If you can't expect that, you can't expect realistic counter play Adrenaline, just deal with it. You can however counter NOED, rewarding you with extra points in the process. And since I'm told only bad killers run it, surely cleansing totems isn't that steep of a challenge compared to a 4K.
---
Personally? I would adjust them both. Limit the one shots on NOED to the number of remaining totems or give it a time limit like Haunted Grounds, or maybe a hook requirement for it to go off. No hooks, no insta downs. Also, try to make Adrenaline not such a must have. There are countless ideas that have been proposed and shut down because "Adrenaline is balanced". I don't see that, it's an incredible perk and it warrants being looked at
---
Interesting, so it becomes a big toxic mess because it becomes more of a personal vendetta against the Killers rather than focusing and coordinating on the objective?
---
Unfortunately I've seen that in a lot of asymmetrical games/modes, people end up dehumanizing the person playing as "the bad guy".
---
True true
---
Thank you that is very sweet q.q
---
Yeah the perk is straight up busted.

It would be nice if killers and survivors could opt in or out for swf or solo queue. As a killer I hate versing toolbox swf's so I just dodge. As a killer and survivor I'd appreciate me as a solo player playing with solo players or me as a killer not versing premade groups.
---
*Bursts up from the mud*
---
YOURE NOT THE ONLY ONE, BUSTER
---
It‚Äôs called doing the objective
---
Good killers will slug at some point, whereas mediocre killers will always pick up on down.  even if you dont get up from unbreakable , 25% recover speed is insanely good for pick ups by team mates, assuming you are facing high level killers. When you actually get up from all slugged it really clutches the game sometimes
---
Maximum immersion
---
Whose that bowsette chick?
---
See thatd be fine, yknow. Like a give up button you can hold, but only if slugged
---
Surveillance is amazing but i already have it smh
---
Yeah and it's not entirely the survivors fault (cept when toolbox and full toxic perks), people just feel gens need to take longer or more objectives need to be added.
---
We should add this to the wikipedia
---
Rushing the objective
---
This would just promote camping unless there's only one trap
---
Is pwyf particularly good on bubba or what? Doesn't his chainsaw count as an offensive action?
---
Oh, and it‚Äôs also the same way for killers. They need a certain amount of hooks. If the killer is gen rushed with no time to hook anyone or every survivor can run them around for TOO long, then the game isn‚Äôt fun for killers.
---
Plot twist it isnt really a pistol but cal. 50 Barret With Explosive Bullets.
---
I'd get the neck thing if survivors were in first person, but they're not.
---
Hail to the King baby. Ash mains rise up!

When you said PIP, you're talking about that 'diamond' on the circles above the player rank? Cuz if you are, then I definitely lost some, cuz Ive been paying attention to those.

If this was a thing bye-bye swf cos everybody would Just turn it off
---
Nice. Already had all 4 of those
---
Spoo... Spoopy.
---
OH MY GAWD, THIS KILLER IS NOT FOLLOWING OUR RULE BOOK!
---
QUICKLY THROW "DA RULEZ" ON HIM!
---
(also you're totally right better secure the kill than risk it)
---
Accurate
---
The only other thing they can do is break totems and go for unhooks as the situation changes.
---
Obviously you not play as a killer.
---
There is 4 survivors on 4 different places. If you start to chase one, and he kite you away from the gens what are under repair... You will loose also. Especially if he reaches an infinite loop place.
---
Sure, it sucks for the hooked survivor. But the team can repair 2 gens while 1 got sacrificed. Or they can remove from the hook with borrowed time (what many people not use, just farm down the hooked).
---
The killer's goal to sacrifice everyone.
---
Yes, pip stands for point in progress. Safety pip would be when you get enough to not go down in rank but not enough to progress. But I've been playing for over 3 years and can confirm you do not lose rank from a DC. It's a guaranteed safety pip. It will tell you you lost progress though. Either you are mistaken and just thought you lost rank or theres a bug. That being said I very much doubt it's a bug as it just happened to me today and I lost no rank progress.
---
I usually camp the living shit out of a object of obsession users, preferably setting up a 3 gen if i can
---
There are times when DCing is appropriate like when the other team are pretty much holding the game hostage and purposefully trying to grief you.
---
Looks amazing, how did you get the singing? Is it yoinked from the game?
---
Just leave dont hold the game hostage.
---
This, I was playing survivor yesterday when someone in the EGC flamed the killer for being a "facecamping bubba, how original" and giving some stupid excuse to "Slug us all if he would want to but instead he decides to camp" what braindead mindset do you have if you think hes gonna chase to the gates and let not only 3 survivors but 4 survivors live.
---
well freddy has the obvlivious while asleep, so he counters BT if the survivors are asleep
---
Plague looks like she's walking down a catwalk

---
I did but a p3 Claudette came out of hiding and started t-bagging. Poor guy :‚Äô(
---
Hate this fooker
---
Oh great, she scares me shitless as it is. This is just going to make it worse
---
And why do you think you should tell a killer how he have to play? It's not less pathetic to declare that the killer have to let you set free the hooked one just because
---
That trailer is scarier than a majority of horror movies I've seen.
---
My typical has been tenacity, adrenaline, wake up, prove thyself
---
Yeah that's what I mean
---
Unbreakable is very good against killers who know how to actually play/ apply pressure. The fact that most killers aren't good means survivors don't always bring it, and thus most good killers don't play around unbreakable.
---
Even then, yeah, the 25% recovery speed is sick. Paired with DS too it's a very nice "invincibility" combo. I run it a lot lately.
---
Thank you

 Legion Skins would‚Äôve been awesome,that‚Äôs all I play.

I'm drooling at the Spirit
---
Yeah i don't get it, i play plague on ps4 i think she's great, never faced one yet though
---
r/forhonor is leaking
---
Especially with the new EGC. You'll see a lot of killers slug when there are only 2 people left to reduce the chances of someone getting the hatch.
---
I never use ruin slows the game down good but spawns next to survivors 80% of the time
---
GORGEOUS
---
cancer, hard to counter, too strong, requires a starfish brain to play
---
I cant tell how many times that actually happens even not during rank reset, ecen yesterday i was running a jungle gym, this claudette decides to come in the middle of my looping only to camp the pallet and instantly drop it, such a turn off for the of the game. Rank 1 btw
---
Gg ez
---
Do we know when the event is? I just really don‚Äôt want to miss this
---
I think a fun buff for boil over would be if you would actually control when and which way the killer gets thrown off their path so you could actively force them to walk into things
---
20 minute match where No Mither david died within first 3 minutes and I had to repair 5 gens all by myself while my teammates where being useless.
---
This Laurie's seen some shit.
---
This post hurts
---
I played a game a while ago where a Nea got caught, and got camped by an insidious Leatherface in the basement, but she had Kindred, so the rest of us just sat on gens.
---
We popped 3 before he finally moved (and Nea was on struggle), we got the save, and all 4 of us got out, and he called us all gen rushers, which is just nonsensical.
---
Killers camping? Go save anyway - "Lmao camping is a legitimate tactic, it's your fault, you should just do gens and get out". Sit on gens - "Fucking toxic genrushers"
---
Basically survivors can't do anything right.
---
Plague's skin is a bit disappointing. Every Hallowed Blight skin is a deformed/"beastified" version of the killer (see Huntress or Spirit), but Plague looks pretty much the same, just with some pox here and there.
---
Everybody gangsta still steve shows up
---
I have that happen so often- they'll do that and not do the one thing that would actually help like tank a hit to reset their bloodlust
---
i prefer aftercare
---
His cigarette is always lit up I think...
---
I'd recommend the Leatherface, he's got really good unlockables and is quite fun. Especially if you chainsaw 4 at once (which is rather rare though).
---
new survivor = the legion
---
Theres a huge skill gap within red ranks alone, so many players immersing their way in there but they dont have the basic concepts of high level gameplay.
---
The new doctor cosmetic looks good

Steve cause he‚Äôs a handsome devil in that scoops ahoy outfit
---
As if getting chased by one killer wasn‚Äôt bad enough holy shit
---
I know but I'd still never find it xD
---
‚ÄúDid I remember to pick up the kids?‚Äù
---
Cos he knows when you are coming to save
---
add territorial imperative as a pig and entity does the job for u....basement its a no no
---
Demogorgon is a good boy
---
Why is it an empty perk slot now? What changed?
---
Nurse is very difficult to learn, when you see a good Nurse player you gotta admit that they spent hundreds of hours learning the killer
---
It's not like red ranks even house good players- you can flat out depip after maxing boldness because the killer decides to facecamp you while your teammates are too scared to unhook, as they escape with +1 pip to their rank for doing gens and running away.
---
Wow console having a leg up on PC dbd?  That‚Äôs rare
---
they need to redesign the eyes of all the old survivors...they look like they sniffed some snow and partied the night before daylight
---
You forget the entititty has been making the Legion powerful enough to actually kill and hunt
---
Plagues skin can be turned from a 5/10 to a 10/10 if she vommits the blight
---
Considering that prior to being taken by the entity, Philip Ojomo's living was made by working for a company who dealt with cars(jalopies to be more precise) I think this skin is the most fitting for the Wraith.
---
It's not tunneling at all, the whole concept of tunneling is kind of BS, it's a strategy, survival of the fittest, if you have someone in an injured state, why wouldnt you go for them as aposed to a full health player who can take 2 hits, and if they have been hooked once (especially if they had gone into the struggle phase before being unhooked) then go for fucking gold
---
this is the only comment in this thread i agree with
---
Head-on, Quick and quiet, Fixated and Inner Strength. Pretty bad build tbh but its worth it when you can slap the killer in the face.
---
And a medkit

---
Were you playing against the clown? Bitch looks like she has been gassed
---
So you baited someone into saving from basement as a camping leatherface and now you're too fucking stupid to understand why someone would possibly not like you? That is both tunneling and camping and I would've dsed your fat ps4-casual ass and proceeded to win the game with you patrolling your basement for 3 mins while we do gens.

Holy cow

There‚Äôs an Evil dead video game being worked on according to Campbell.  So there‚Äôs that to look forward to.

i bet he is the type to run adrenaline decisive selfcare and balance landing, and stays at yellow ranks to bully killers. But the first moment he gets downed he dcs screwing over his team.
---
No

*protection hits* need to be fixed
---
this skin + prayer beads = shitting your pants
---
Ugh, not a fan of tooo grotesque skins tbh, I fuckin love spirit but I'm not a fan of this at all tbh
---
Great skin, shame his piss bottles arent full of blight.
---
tell me about it. The other day with the dc bug (killers leaving after the game is over. By that i mean leaving during the end game screen instantly) i get a message telling me i am trash for dcing... like bruh...
---
they won't slow the game down a little bit but fucking \*\*\*Fasten the game just a lil bit\*\*\*
---
Yeah. But that's the thing. The Legion in my case had seen and yet all of them. A piece of shit Adam even pointed to me to tell the Legion to kill me off and the Legion agreed. He was a shit Killer as well. Had it been a normal game and my teammates actually did gens when I was being chased then they could've easily gotten 1-3 gens done while I was looping him round a path of L and T walls. Didn't use a single pallet.
---
C'mon man don't trash about his pro strats!!!!
---
Youre right. My bad lol.
---
Bro NSFW this

Im hoping its meg as well, dwight and claud had theres

They are blind as an avacado
---
Stay in /r/teenagers homo. You can't even fucking write properly "there" or they're? Right they're, good job you learned something from the so-called "idiot" you fucking 14 year old queermo. Also the irony of camping noobs like you calling anyone bad, the biggest noobs in this game are campers like OP and you, why else would you do such a boring braindead "strategy" if you were actually good enough to win chases and pressure map properly? Exactly, go talk to some 5 year olds pretending to be 16 now, so gay.
---
people just need to remember to wake up before going for saves if they are running borrowed time
---
Nah...
---
You should never be loop trapping mid chase. The strength of hag comes from trapping the shit out of one quarter of the map, then funneling survivors thru it. If you have to stop mid chase to place a trap just to keep up trap pressure, you've already lost the chase.
---
Or they are old enough and played enough with online games, so they know that shit happens, and you can dc cause of your ISP, or cause the client crashes. Or cause IRL is more important, and shit can hit the fan there too.
---
* Added undetectable status affect to the Pig while crouching
---
* Removed the Pig~~s ability to crouch~~
---
I mean any high rank player runs bt and ds exactly due to all killers doing this
---
how on earth is it a good idea? seems like a very unnecessary buff to a killer that is already very strong and a nerf to a perk so its completely useless against a freddy.
---
I love how the Pig crouches right next to you, then proceeds to crouch walk away. That‚Äôs why you look around folks.
---
Running, sprinting, walking, crouching, crawling - it affects everything.
---
Baseline:
---
Madness has 3 tiers. Once you reach T1 and T2, you're in them for the rest of the game. T3 you can snap out of.
---
Tier 1, your character screams once as you go into it, alerting the doctor to your position. Additionally, skill checks have a 33% chance of appearing somewhere randomly on the screen (not just the middle), along with static.
---
T2 is the same as T1, except it's a 66% chance. Additionally they see hallucinations of the Doctor who just... Stand there and do nothing.
---
T3 means you can't do ANY actions except vaulting, dropping pallets, and "snapping out of it" (which puts you back to T2). Additionally your character screams every few seconds. Skill checks have a 100% chance of appearing in a random spot on screen with static, but that only applies to snapping out of it. Additionally the hallucinations now show and Aura to the doctor.
---
It's completely meaningless since if a survivor is on T3, you're probably already in a chase, so all the tracking elements of T3 are entirely wasted unless you misplay and lose track of them.
---
Additionally, zapping a player directly in any tier means they can't interact with anything for roughly 2.5 seconds, including pallets and windows.
---
That's IT. That's ALL IT DOES by default. Add ons add a few extra abilities that go from "shouldn't this be default?" To "oh hey this actually makes him pretty strong".
---
Of course it's Frank. Who else would have done it?
---
I don't think you can buy leatherface with shards since he is licensed
---
Because we dont really have any other good option outside of pop which by the time you get to use the first time unless survivors are potato 3 gens are already gone, so id rather pray for a good ruin spawn and have 1/20 good games than 20 shit games.
---
Knock out and surveillance are good on niche builds for some killers.
---
That Pig is executing what's called a Pro Gamer Patrol.
---
Geezus. Is everything okay at home? Do you need someone to talk to? That much rage is bad for your health.
---
I know but salty survivors beg to differ
---
Hmm. If they are trying to get you to chase them, and you are chasing them - Then you are being tricked. If you catch them fast then their tactic didn't work and you can take the high ground. But it is their play not yours. 
---
If they do it and it works out badly for them, then they won't continue to do it. This is the point. I'm no teabag flashlighter, but I'll defend people trying to distract killers, because they will always exploit weaknesses. If it works, they will do it.
---
You may be speaking for yourself, because you are just a 'pro killer'. But it is obvious that this "toxicity" gets to killers and makes them fuck up. The tilt is real.
---
HOLY SHIT
---
Oh no I made him mad.
---

Legions so underrated.. :( everyone says legions a bad killer but every time I play (rank 13 usually against green ranks) I end up with 40-60k bp and double pip almost every time rarely any survivors. Without bbq too, but with offerings. Seriously if you know how to use them and are ready for a long match legions at least b or c tier.
---
the fuck, i could literally get rank 1 surv with one hand while jerking my dick to huntress p0rn on my second monitor, neither surv or killer takes any effort anymore to get rank 1 if you are actually born with hands.
---
sound mate.
---
Can we actually though? This is fucking amazing. The start with little to no tension building tension up until the chase. Its exactly like the Halloween chase music which is what makes Michael more frightening as a killer.
---
I agree, having 0 gens done every single game I played as killer was very balanced.
---
You only lose a pip when the killer crashes (which sucks), if he straight up hit the "leave button", you don't lose anything.
---
Yeah, ikr, this is actually amazing. Even if BHVR made it so we have to pay like 2-5$ for it, it would be actually cool and fits her Japanese story
---
just doing a daily dont mind me
---
Until you bring Object against him and he is permanently revealed
---
I don't agree with the omni-directional survivor grunts if it's going to be a general change for survivors. I'm fine if it's something only attached to phasing but nothing else
---
Typical day for Ash, thinking he's won but in fact he fucked himself over
---
I just want babysitter steve
---
New survivor: Pyrosanical
---
New killer: DJ Keemstar
---
Man, sometimes the sweet justice of leading the killer to a shitty teammate (not that I think you were one) is so satisfying though. 
---
Had one meg farm me and my friend (she died 3rd hook) but since I was running aftercare at the time, I could see each time that apart from farming on hook she was just crouching in the corner of the map, not even touching gens. The killer then found me, and my friend, who was watching in spectator mode, told me the Meg was just crouching near the hatch. Being the petty bitch I am, and knowing that I can't finish 2 gens myself with a BBQ huntress while the meg camped hatch...I ran straight towards her, got slugged, and just crept closer and closer. Huntress actually found her, hung her up and let me crawl to the hatch. So satisfying. Post game chat was hilarious.
---
Surprised none of you did the *task manager tech* when the secret offering popped up. 
---
A few brand new friends started playing DBD and I always make sure to prevent them from going against Moris. There is literally zero reasons to play a match like this. 
---
Killers will mori them immediately considering they aren't very good at looping and then they will have to spectate throughout the rest of the match.
---
People rarely bring object. I see it like once every 20-30 games.
---
Rancor comes under the umbrella of perks that I personally think shouldn't be in the game. Not because they're OP or anything, but because the benefit you get from using them are minimal compared to how frustrating they are to play against. The only 3 perks I put there are Rancor, Franklin's Demise, and OLD DS.
---
Rancor guarantees you one kill, which you don't even get full points for. In games where you "benefit" from it, the game is already won or lost, it just feels SUPER shit for the survivor on the receiving end. It denies that one survivor literally thousands of bloodpoints for barely any on your end, as well as more potential points for (late game!) hook rescues that could have happened.
---
Franklin's Demise is always a crapshoot. It's either a wasted perk slot if everyone's running grey toolboxes they don't give a shit about, or literally costs the survivors up to 10k bloodpoints because they had the audacity to get M1ed. And the killer will never KNOW if they prevented an instaheal or if it was a grey shitkit. The frustration ALWAYS outweighed the enjoyment.
---
And Old DS was never actually that strong in MOST games (high tier was a different story) and usually only added about 10 seconds for one chase in most games, but it felt SO bullshit when you got shanked, and even worse when you got shanked more than once in a game.
---
So yeah I have a problem with Rancor but only from a design standpoint
---
You don‚Äôt even need to wake up and you have plenty of time to get distance from the generator when Freddy starts teleporting to it

Used to use Urban Evasion/Bond but as someone who plays solo 9/10 times and actually does their job in getting totems, Inner Strength is an absolute godsend of a perk. Better Together is also a better solo perk than Bond IMO especially paired with Prove Thyself.

I really wish they would add a casual mode, something to reduce queue times and stop both sides from going full try-hard all the time, at the higher ranks that is
---
I'll reword it then..
---
I main Freddy and I've noticed so many weaknesses for him. He can teleport across the map to a gen then he has to walk all the way back to apply pressure back to the people healing which they'll be long gone from that area. He's annoying but not op. + he's an m1 killer with a snare that's easily avoidable since it's so small. But obviously this could be biased.
---
oof i have folders and folders of it. I wish i had your good experiences man.
---
mate, you really need to seek help. You sound so stressed like youre about to die of a heart attack just by taking a shower. implying you do shower of course. no judgement.
---
This is such a tiring take on the situation. Anybody with half a brain cell knows that if you teabag/flashlight spam you can be expected to be camped, tunnelled or smacked on the hook. If anybody is sending you messages or getting salty in post game chat because they were a dickhead and you camped them, that‚Äôs them being salty because they tried to bully you and it failed, don‚Äôt take what they say seriously.
---
Lmao imagine saying that unironicly

Unless he‚Äôs better then spirit or nurse, he doesn‚Äôt need nerfing,

At least it makes more sense tho.

---
My main advice is to quit the game. This game is not for you. Nor any pvp game.
---
Or you have to accept that every game have a learning curve, and 2-3 is nothing in Dbd. And it even worst, if you almost not playing with survivor. No matter what you think of your skills, you see that it is not true. If you think you good enough already, then you will learn nothing, and you will just keep making excuses for your self (like that mood thing). You should watch videos how to do chases, how to make decisions. Even if you think you already know, because trust me, it will show you new things. And practice those what you learned. 
---
You also have to lvl up your other killers for other perks. Piggy with her own perks only is kinda useless on higher lvl-s. Yeah, that means grinding.
---
Rank 11 over 2 weeks is not bad, but now you starting to get better survivors, who know the game tricks better. That is so simple, and you have to let away the rush for ranks.
---

Otz is actually a great example of how frustrating and grueling it is to go against tryhard SWF team even for a good player and how hard it is to counter them. Even if he was running meta perks, that game would have gone similarly
---
And yet we get people in here who say swf should be removed, i laugh at that because if they still are bad, even after all these buffs to killer and nerfs to survivors, if you cant get at least 2k per game you have to be a noob or just really suck
---
If I understood the bug right, it was just the ‚Äúblegh!‚Äù noise that you hear when you trip one of her traps, except she did it when she teleported too so you‚Äôd hear it twice.
---
Bold of you to assume it will last even that long.
---
What can I say? You tunnelled her.
---
You should've just hooked the Steve.
---
At least we already have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aj497x/so_the_new_spirit_skins_are_here/)!
---
This is a perfect concept for a story-campaign type of thing:
---
The Killers in-fight to decide who gets to kill the survivors, and thusly, the survivors have to deal with extra agitated killers and the killers are semi-distracted by making sure that their kills don't get stolen. 
---
Behavior, hire me as a story writer, damnit.
---
Bwahaha!! Dat speed doeüòÇüòÇ

So what youre saying is. instead of getting two hooks. I should of just gotten one hook?

You sound like a little attentinowhore queer, no friends on ps4 for a reason my dude.

yeah man i hate when i get scared and my eyes leave my sockets

Thanks for reminding me that it‚Äôs technically canon that he has died by the hands of every individual dbd killer

I love the devs for making Jane so thicc
---
That's Play With Your Food 3 if I've ever seen it
---
Hit the nail on the head. Killer games are almost always at least two people in a swf group and I lose more often than not because I play mid-tier killers (on console so nurse isn't an option). Then I play solo queue survivor and either everyone is stupid or killers have an easy time against an uncoordinated team.
---
Again you? My God your stupidity still strong af
---
The whole daily system is badly designed. Not everyone enjoys playing a specific killer or a survivor. Dailies should be unanimous in their completion. If the mission says open a gate with X survivor then it should be changed to open a gate with any survivor. Killer specific ones should be changed from e.g. Trap 3 survivors in bear trap to use your power ability and succeed 3 times.
---
Dailies also should be provided for both sides, so one for killer and one for survivor per day.
---
And the gun did nothing except piss it off. Then getting hit with the bat annoyed it enough for it to step on the bear trap where he would be burnt. The only things that did anything we're the bear trap and the gasoline + lighter combo and the legions are trying to puncture it's skin which as was established in season 1 pretty hecking difficult.
---
I too have buggy dailies but as a killer main I'm not too bothered about the skewed ratio of survivor to killer lol
---
I agree with all these points. They were most likely aiming to match Spirit's Lore with rancor, but I think it should be reworked.
---
right? Saw the scratch makes. decided to follow. saw they led to the basement. got steve down via chainsaw. got claudette up the stairs. im a tunneler lol.
---
I use it sometimes and it's a pretty simple mindset for me:  
---
Ruin = survivors looking for it immediately, gotta capitalize immediately.  
---
Devour Toes = they won't be looking immediately, but I'm going to lose 2 gens before I start to see value
---
I think it works for what's it's going for and I enjoy the half and half gimmick, I just feel BHVR don't feel like they can do much with the plague, many of her skins appear similar.
---
Thank you for sharing this important content. All of our lives would've been worse if we hadn't seen it.

---
im not saying "play a very specific way and purposely let people go", Im saying the game rewards killers for allowing longer games. if you tunnel one person or camp you lose points and will potentially get gen rushed and only get 1 kill. thats like 10k points. probably a depip too. is it worth it? up to you i guess.
---
Also what about David and Tapp
---
This is definitely me when I‚Äôm destroying a survivor‚Äôs pallet.
---
I‚Äôve been getting a lot of hate recently on PS4. Weird it‚Äôs just sudden, but funny. A lot of survivors aren‚Äôt that good, only a few are actually good from my experience
---
&gt;If you go instantly after the hooked player and continue chasing them if they have bt that‚Äôs tunneling.
---
Not really tho. It's strategic to sacrifice a player who's dead on last hook because the survivor team will be one man down, and you can wait out Borrow Time's duration while chasing them. Decisive strike is another matter tho.
---
Paper mache
---
It's one of those perks no many use but when they do its because they're in SWF feeding even more info to their team. I honestly think they need to rework that perk. Fun fact, it would be 5th perk from Halloween chapter to be either nerfed or reworked.
---
also you have to understand when I give advice its toward red rank killers and survivors. A full red rank survivor team WILL NOT allow you more than 1 kill if you camp and tunnel.
---
Yes. I hate it how some gaming communities are like "YoU aRe ToXiC aNd UnSkIlLeD fOr UsInG gOoD cHaRaCtErS/sKiLls" Like, that's what they're there for you idiot.

Are you actually that dense?

I would like to see a vs series of killer vs killer

I run devour on ghostface just to be "that guy" It seems to work out but if someone just happens to run by my totem during a chase then "dead men tell no tales" right?

Splish splash, your opinion is trash

I'm crap, and I never said any different.

But you might wanna check your own video to see what I was talking about...
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
That's how I play. Makes things more challenging for me and more fun for the Survivors.
---
Ya it looks trash tbh
---
All depends how you play just run killer around and do gens while being a bit immerse
---
Alright thanks. Didn't ask, but thanks.
---
Of he would have it that surv harassing him, they would have freed you and the killer would have gotten at least one of you, possibly both of you on hook. Bad doc.
---
They should lend those to survivors.

Excatly

That doesn't equal tunneling tho. I can show you a real example of hardcore tunneling. Sec.

Such a bad idea, this isn‚Äôt a idea for DBD it would never work thankfully.
---
Dude you realize survivors are literally walking bags of meat without good perks? This sorry excuse for an idea might work at rank 20-15, but any higher and you NEED good perks to even think about playing a match
---
How so?

Hey you say 2 names from stranger things Jane and Eleven I don‚Äôt instantly think thicc Jane I think ST Jane you nob

We better get the N U T T E S A C S again

I got the answer he‚Äôs a super saiyen and can teleport
---
100% agree, I never bring Moris unless it‚Äôs for a ritual and even at that I only use ivory and try only mori the last survivor, or if they have 3 gens completed, always message the guy and apologise because I needed to for the daily. Proximity camping I can understand for new killers they might be scared of not getting a sacrifice but once you hit purple ranks you shouldn‚Äôt need to rely on proximity camping just to get a sacrifice there‚Äôs no excuse anymore. Gen rushing from survivors can be frustrating yes but it‚Äôs literally their only objective and with time and experience you learn how to end chases quickly and slow the game down.
---
Honestly it depends on your rank. Once you get to red ranks you notice a pretty large difference.
---
I get slugged long enough for those perks to work every other game.
---
LICENSED KILLER.
---
The amount of Chins tho
---
Imagine if survivors could know which killer it is so that situational perks like that weren't completely useless.
---
It would suck for the killer but it would definitely help build diversity
---
YA YEET
---
You misspelled "Nea"
---
Object imo you‚Äôre asking to be tunneled and face camped - a good killer will leave you until last, a toxic killer will face camp you.
---
"would it be cool if we got an eleven RELATED outfit for Jane" why would I say that it would be cool if we got an eleven related outfit for herself
---
When it comes to the annoying teabagging flashlight clicking types, I prefer to come back to check on them a bit earlier than usual after hooking them. Lowers their chance of getting to a loop if they get rescued just as I start coming back. They die faster, I infuriate them as much as they've infuriated me, win-win.
---
I don't blame you. That's actually only thing you should do at the end if you have someone hanging,exit open, no point in chasing. They need to get him, fair to say, you shouldn't give up your points just because some douche says you're camping. During the game, yeah it's annoying. i hate campers. But if nobody notices that killer is camping and you should do gens/totems, they are stupid. Camping killer, whether im on the hook, or gens, is the easiest escape. Especially in higher ranks.
---
Yesterday i had a match that had me feel the best karma in the game ever.

I got hooked at the last gen to distract the killer to give time to do the gens, exits were across the map of course, had lithe. Made nearly to the exit with 3(!!!!!!) of them hanging around. As soon as they saw me and killer, one opened the gates, other two stayed very close (less than 5meters) with me down under a pallet.
---
Killer leaves me there, looking for other since no one left. He picks me up, mind you pallet is still up there, just drop it, and all 4 escape. You probably see where this is going... Blood Warden. Nobody dropped the pallet, blood warden activates, EVERYONE died. Funny thing, all 4 of us were red ranks... i wouldn't mind if everyone were greens or purples.. lol killer wasn't the smartest, but the survivors were beyond selfish lol. I sacrificed myself so they'd have a chance of finishing a gen in the basement (the temple map), to only lose because they cannot think (to be completely fair he did have NOED.)
---
This is pretty awesome man! Definitely like your style. Keep it up!
---
Yeah I saw that :( But I still think BHVR should acknowledge him and say something because new community made chase musics are great
---
I am on PC and my killer queues were 1 min tops as a purple rank.
---
Nurse is an option. Take the time to improve. I've seen nurses that can wipe any swf team at rank 1. Tired of that nurse is worthless on console bs.
---
Because Jane has no relation and wouldn‚Äôt fit in children‚Äôs clothes you dirty basement dweller. You want some weird cross over fan fic
---
Yea I noticed lol but I‚Äôm still having fun play as Ghost Face
---
Well duh, he has an Insta Down, small terror radius and one of the most troll builds in the game SM at lerrys
---
Thank for making your voice heard mate ! &lt;3
---
If you haven‚Äôt done anything to deserve it then yeah of course it‚Äôs a moral victory, I usually struggle the entire way to give my team more time to do gens.
---
Hol up what
---
Bad internet??? Or you killed them and they didn‚Äôt like it
---
I downed someone and when I picked them up they disconnected and one other disconnected once I got them hooked
---
Watch, soon as dedicated servers come out and they can issue timeouts on dc‚Äôs. Queue times will be ion a fat rise
---
Iron Will only counters Spirit
---
Spine Chill counters all stealth killers and gives you a head start with all the others. I usually use is not for the countering factor, but I just like having that bit of information. I know when I should leave the gen, which areas are safe and overall Spine Chill lets me "enter the killer's mind"
---
What do you mean fix killer spawn? Do you mean spawn the killer as far away from survivors as possible so you have a better chance to not get caught? 
---
There's no problem with the spawns, sometimes you just get a bad one, others you get a good one, totally random. This happens so little for an individual that it isn't worth patching for it
---
Obviously I didn't mean children clothes. Just an outfit that has some similarities. Because I thought it would be kind of a cool "Easter egg" because of the same name thing...
---
Killer spawns back in the golden days of DBD:

---
It's a lot more difficult playing killer than survivor, especially when there's coordination in the high ranks. The perks help but when you get high up you have to be perfect at managing your time and balancing chases with patrols. Survivors essentially just need to learn how to loop and keep the killer's attention which isn't difficult. I'm not saying that killers are better or anything, just that it's a lot less stressful playing survivor.

---
Did you not have your morning coffee my guy? Someone seems a little on edge.
---
??? Did you see the wallpaper? Dude no offense but this is nothing special
---
Yesterday I played that game with 3 people, one on the hook, 2 within about 10 meters, and an open exit gate.
---
I REALLY wanted this Nea on the hook dead, but when they bumrushed the hook I downed a Claudette, and then the Meg on the way to the gate. With Nurse's I saw the Nea healing in the gate, and used Shred to smack her down as soon as I came around the corner and her fingers grazed the exit line.
---
I picked her up, placed her outside the gate, and watched as all 3 died to the EGC about 5 seconds later.
---
8 days old but I'll still comment...
---
Legion is the laziest designed killer in terms his lore and how it has literally nothing to do with his gameplay.
---
I still hope for the father as a character. Killer OR survivor.
---
This is legendary looool
---
I don't think anything they did to it really did shit other than the fire, everything else was just to push it towards the trap to be stuck in the fire.  Hell the thing tanked like 300 rifle rounds a few minutes after being burned
---
There's a decent looking game in development right now called Your Turn To Die. Lots of puzzle solving and interesting characters stuck in a death game. Chapter one and two are out and translated into English right now. Plus, they're free.
---
Ngl, this is the coolest fanart I've seen for dbd ever.
---
Yes officer this is the post right here .
---
Should've been 3 prestige Claudette's shining their flashlights in his face
---
not to mention it was shot up by hundreds of rifle rounds at the school and was completely unphased
---
*Legion becomes a drug dealer*
---
Great, now she looks fit for the part to tear my ass a new one. Neat.
---
Meh, I let them have their fun. Getting angry about teams celebrating just makes you a sore loser.
---
No excuse for people who message you hate though, fuck them.
---
I like to run Devour AND Ruin on Hag. Certainly throws the survivors for a loop when they see multiple hexes and ignore one once they've gotten the Ruin, assuming its Haunted Ground. And then I start mori'ing them.

But Hag is definitely better. You can loop T3 Myers. You can‚Äôt loop Lisa.

---
I never understood it. I get TONS of messages when playing as both sides but its 95% survivors talkin shit. Ill be playin solo and ill get hate cuz i didnt do somethin their way so damn annoying. I had my messages turned off but my friend kept meetin nice people so i turned it back on. Havent met a nice person still waitin.
---
Just had a game with a meg from Thailand who was teamed up with a OoO Laurie who DC'd on first hook and a Bill and Jane who were glitchy af, perhaps they were just laggy but could be other possibility as well. 
---
So I got disposed of Clickity Clack Jane pretty easily while hooking Bill twice and Meg once in between. I found both of them in a corner and Meg got in my way to get hit and I hooked her again very well knowing Bill wasn't going anywhere. After letting Bill know that he is in my range and I can down him i walked away a faur distance to let him rescue meg after that and a loop around pallet I downed Bill. 
---
But Meg was still around trying to get a pallet rescue so I  had to down her too to pick Bill and finish him. And then I was looking for hatch to let her go meanwhile she got up and started running I let her take the hatch and in postgame chat **same Meg gave me ggez and 5555 which is thai way of typing laugh** (dont ask me why that is so).
---
Like bitch what part of the game was hard for you yo understand I was easy on u??

Dead hard, decisive strike, adrenaline, self care, deliverance, etc

---
sent bud!
---
Hag main right here. Can't wait.
---
Lucky me he's the only killer I've gone P3 with and the mask makes it a lot tougher to see him in the dark. 
---
That said the way his cosmetics are going I expect the next mask to be made entirely out of neon lights and he gets a speaker attached to his hot pink coat that constantly plays chase music at full volume
---
Yeah, i didn't know how to add the full context to the meme without making it wordy.
---
This one is good.
---
From a distance, we could have hear the Hag screaming at me while teleporting back to the trap I just walked into. At first, thought she was just rude, but I guess its a bug.

Are you sure you aren‚Äôt trying to use Ghost Face as Michael Myers because that‚Äôs a common problem most people who say that he‚Äôs bad have?
---
I just felt really disappointed with he quality of the plague skin
---
I think you forgot that this reddit is 90% killer mains, sorry man
---
Hag is a bit weird in that shes incredibly strong but for some reason the general population has no idea how to play her or even acknowledges her strength. Its why we got a tier list that put her in D tier.
---
Alert, Surveillance- These are both good, pick them up if you can
---
Vigil- Shit
---
Knock Out- Good for slugging builds
---
You should know what rule 34 and 35 of the internet are saying.

Hoooo bald Jane best Jane! even with her new blond hair, she goes bald but brown/dark bold! Unplayable.
---
Claudettes*, learn English.
---
I got MoM to work recently running. 
---
Medkit with instaheal, Inner strength, Second Wind, MoM, DS or Adrenaline. 
---
A bunch of perks for you to get healed up faster so you can get back in to takes hits again. Its a nice surprise at the end of the game for the killer.
---
Don't have any reason to :)
---
Pretty cringe that you want a grown woman in child‚Äôs clothing.
---
were you playing on the PTB? Thats super strange that you lost progress on different characters. Did you had that problem before ?
---
Yeah man, flashlight saves are a harsh reality for many unfortunate people.
---
myers is a high tier for sure, but absolutely not the best. Spirit, hag, nurse and billy are all definitively stronger.
---
You obviously don't know how to use apostrophes, so yes you do have to learn English. Replying with a smiley does nothing, you're just being a dumbass.
---
I can't change your mind if you are out of it
---
Exactly, people will say "but its situational since it only comes in clutch when the gens are done"
---
First of all, NO SHIT! Its an endgame perk, so naturally, we judge its strength based on how effective it is during the end game. The fact that its not used until the endgame is not a drawback, its simply implicit with its design, nevermind the fact you still 3 more perks slot to more than compensate for that. 
---
Secondly, some will say "but you do have to do something, you have to do gens!" Ok, so for doing the bare minimum (aka the objective) you are rewarded with an insta-heal and a speed boost. Ignoring the fact that you don't even have to be the one doing the gens... In fact,
---
Thirdly, what bothers me most about adrenaline is that, contrary to what survivor mains will say, it doesn't reward you for doing well, in fact it doesn't reward you for doing anything. You could have been croutching around doing nothing and still have adrenaline pop, and let's aso not forget the INSTA-HEAL OFF THE HOOK. Its no different from pre-rework Decisive Strike, its a perk that's designed to bail you out when you have fucked up.
---
Get that salt out of your asshole
---
*me nodding and teabagging my teammates instead of doing objectives
---
I literally don't know.
---
If this pisses you off, imagine how it is for a non-camping Legion main to be camped by Legion when playing survivor.
---
I have a pet theory that a lot of kids play Legion, because their usual justification in post-game chat is "lololol I'm not doing anything wrong".
---
Stems from "Bad Mouthing" but has evolved to encapsulate all forms of toxicity to a peer
---
I think someone's getting mori'd.
---
JK, it's your personal opinion.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
doesn't matter, seeing new players trying their best is adorable
---
Good thing he didn't bother to chase you
---
I agree that it's a worse Lery's, but Lery's is my favourite map, so...
---
Bro its not that serious
---
If you're looking at a hidden trophy, you can push a button to unhide it. It tells you on the actual screen - hit `SQUARE` to reveal.
---
At a guess, it may be Blood on your Face - you need to kill all 4 survivors in a single match.
---
Sound? I'm not sure what you're referring to here.
---
because the game was not popular and was suffering from ppl lobby dogging just to play with friends. without swf the game would have died awhile ago honestly and we would not have so many license killers etc after they added swf the game became huge
---
Looks Cool, keep at it
---
He seems to take 1 mistake pretty serious ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Neither, Its mostly just good for spirit players and stealth killers. It's just a dc map if you're playing survivor or any other killer.
---
I feel like being 200% more edgy would kinda be fucking hilarious. Vigo sticks them with the serum and they start posting 9/11 jokes on r/dankmemes.
---
Totally agree. Flip flop is just the most amazing perk ever! Not to mention the amazing killer and map that come with tha....never mind.

Look at that nodding

Getting shot at close range with submachine guns didn't phase it. Getting hit by a spiky piece of wood in the stomach stunned it a few times, then a bear trap caught it. 
---
So getting shot in it's open mouth , all ove rit's body with lead doesn't phase it, but nails do? That makes no sense, and that's inconsistent.
---
The only part that made sense is that fire hurt the fuck out of it, and it was charred when it appeared at the school.
---
Wtf is wrong with you lol
---
BT is fine but I do have a problem with DS because I can go hook two other survivors and the guy with DS could be killed, I can down him and still get hit with it because the timer is absurdly long
---
Now *this* is **shitposting** in its purest form.
---
op was saying that the unhooker needs to be awake to apply borrowed time to the hooked person. That's why freddy is such a hard counter to borrowed time now, because 1. the unhooker needs to be awake to apply borrowed time, and 2. if the person being unhooked has borrowed time, if they get hit, the timer will just drain even if theyre being chased and they would be downed in 15 seconds like in the video.
---
Queue 50 comments about "getting rewarded for being bad" as if endgame builds aren't a thing
---
That would remove the "horror" aspect though. If I play survivor, I want to be scared. If I play killer, I want to be scary.
---
That's the draw of the game, how it makes you feel like you're part of a horror movie.
---
I think it would be counterproductive to smudge the lines between the roles like that.
---
It's not about getting angry, but about simple disrespect and lacking good manners. Such people are annoying af

They usually leave immediately

I'm a pro gamer and got Ghostface P3 as the blood on the mask somewhat masks its brightness.
---
That girl looks like the lead singer of Unleash the Archers
---
The scarecrow would be great especially for the maps with cornfields. Have several scarecrows scattered about with one being the killer and survivors not knowing which is which. Would be hard to implement I know but the idea would be awesome!
---
there isn't much "posting" going on tho -do better next time
---
Demogorgon gets one swipe and someone gets ripped open.
---
Sadly it's normal for killers
---
oh, I did not see it, so decided to post here, I'll deleted this one then
---
Are they definitely seeing the scoring events ingame? It'd be worth recording a game to see, because if it turns out to be a bug then the footage would be very useful for the devs.
---
This seriously happened to me multiple times in a match against I think it was either a nurse or a bubba during double BP

What was going through your head though?

Literally the first part read?

Was there an announcement I missed? Guys in Question thread were saying we don‚Äôt even ha e a confirmation on the blight this year.

Now that I run inner strength I'm always looking for a totem for that 8 second heal.

Gonna get knockout so i can at least slug effectively.

Good, you got exposed kid. Better luck next time.

This is when the survivors discover your a Blood Warden trap card has been activated

I love the idea of Ghostface going around taking pictures with all the other killers

Further solidifying why I don't understand how none of the L4D infected made the game

Some people are just assholes that's a undisputed fact.

That's an awesome idea and yeah this game is begging for a scarecrow with the crows and fields!

---
Lazy town got rough
---
Same.
---
You only have so many of those. 
---
It is just my way of categorizing it, but I don‚Äôt count red addons toward how good I consider a killer overall. 
---
Nearly any red or purple addon makes any killers or survivors verging on OP, or at least significantly increases their strength.
---
I would say yellow addons are the highest I would use for categorizing a killer‚Äôs potential. Any higher and it isn‚Äôt really reliable.
---
All seeing power!
---
I feel like doc would win if all killers fought. He would get bubba and huntress to do work for him.
---
Scary in what sense? Gameplay or aesthetics? Personally, the idea of catching the plague and puking my guts out as I die scares me more than just getting stabbed.
---
Good plan I‚Äôm just scared to lose some pips and have to start over a bit
---
Well if youre gonna run the perks of the apocalypse, dont half ass it. Get rid of spine chill and put both on

No 11 because that‚Äôs killing a kid and GTA didn‚Äôt have the balls to do so I doubt DBD has the balls.

10's are fine.  I have 3000 hours in the game.  I wish as a returning player there was a way to raise your matchmaking rank without stomping new players.  I'm playing without Ruin to try to at least give them a little fun.
---
I wasn't playing last year I'm just excited we're getting a halloween event but I did watch footage of it from last year and the petals thing looked really cool.
---
I sacrificed my wife.
---
Yeah surveillance doesn't work with surge only gens that you personally kicked. Not sure if that's supposed to be like that or it's just something the devs overlooked, but as of right now they don't work together.
---
That's been happening since the double point update!!!
---
Hag is fun, I'm getting stbfl for her now and can't wait for MYC to show in shrine!
---
What's the song in OP? It sounds awesome, probably a TV show theme but I can't place it.
---
Im a plague main and here are my perks:  
---
BBQ
---
Infectious Fright
---
Deer stalker
---
Knock out/any utility abilities you like
---
I play with slug style, you will puke at all gens, you will engage players with puke and pursue them with pukes till they get perma injured then you click on them.
---
As they get downed infectious kicks in and you will chase the nearest survivor and puke on them, if they run too far you go back to pick up the slug.
---
Ive had times where I can get super puke active and down a guy, chase an infectious trigger and down everyone with a single super puke power up.
---
made it to like rank 5 or something with this since most players relied on first injury speed boost, default puke damage doesnt trigger speed boost so you get to have the lead in the chase the entire time!
---
‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù
---
I had this issue when I lost connection to Steam. i got my BP back so I was able to just purchase the perks again.
---
It's okay white knight, it's okay.
---
I had always thought it was "Bad Manners", but I was first introduced to the term with Hearthstone, so maybe it was originally "mouthing".
---
Idk if it‚Äôs trolling or if they are that delusional to think they‚Äôre that good to escape
---
The scarecrow on the left is the scarecrow from injustice 2.
---
THATS WACK V2
---
Yeah, because killers never do toxic stuff like hitting survivors on the hook, puking over downed survivors multiple times as Plague, t-bag as Ghostface etc
---
I hate this. This is revolting.
---
The Horde
---
This killer is a group of zombies. 
---
Your terror radius would be a collective moan. 
---
Its power could be leaving zombies behind to patrol a small area. 
---
Power one- Grim guard: The Horde leave a shambling horror to patrol X area, the horror has a terror radius and a red stain of it's own. If the shambling horror's red stain touches a survivor the horror lunges at the survivor letting out a loud moan and grappling with the survivor. The grapple will initiate a skill check, if failed the survivor is injured one state, and the horror rots to nothing.
---
Power two- Ghoul grab: The Horde leaves a torso in a  dark location, should a survivor cross the torsos path it will latch onto them, moaning loudly and slowing their movement as they run. This would present another skill check, if stationary it would appear predictably, but if trying to shake off the entangling torso while moving the check would appear erratically on the screen. 
---
If The Horde "leader" is by itself, its terror radius is reduced/gone. 
---
The members of the horde could fall away too as they're hit by pallets, absorbing the stun for a momentary slow instead. 
---
Similar to the plague, The Horde could spawn shallow graves around the map where more zombies could crawl forth. 
---
Alternatively, if a survivor is killed, The Horde can raise a zombified version of them.
---
I am thankful that TF2's October event came early this year
---
Oh yeah definitely. if it's a short loop I tend to get them with ambush by going in one direction then whipping around to the other last second. Either that or I go left, then right, then left, then right, (going a little farther each time) then when they run to face the pallet I lunge and most times I get the hit.  I change it depending on the survivor. If it's a group of survivors that just run to killer shack whenever they take a single hit, I just go over there until I can break the pallet, then I disengage. Killer shack loops are annoying. The only time I'll chase them there is if there already injured. As for pallet breaks, i've found that it's better to try and get them to face a wall of some sort when you break it. That way they aren't a distant shape by the time you actually break it. Can't tell you how many Steve's I've got because they tried to loop right against the outer walls, or against the side of a house.
---
Idk why but I just pictured Claudette trying to Head On a Myers and just gets fucking impaled instead
---
I learned that there is like a 5k or so cap on single actions from playing doctor. You can‚Äôt shock only to cap at 8k, you need the shock + hit points (forget the name) to cap out devious.
---
In the video above; I'm running Surge, Thrilling Tremors and Surveillance.
---
I knock down Nancy with an M1 attack, causing a nearby gen to explode due to Surge. The gen's aura turns white, thanks to Surveillance; and I then pick up Nancy, activiating Thrilling Tremors.
---
What's weird is that then gen gets completed, while Thrilling Tremors is active, without turning yellow. If a Survivor had stayed on the gen after Surge exploded it, the aura would have turned yellow (Surveillance) or red (not blocked by Thrilling Tremors).
---
Was this a glitch? Do these perks not work together?
---
Toxic killers do not tend to teabag or type ggez.
---
And killers' "toxicity" is usually just cheesy killer strats like camping or tunneling or using strong perks/addons/mori or playing serious. It's not the same as teabagging at the exit gates just bc killer gave a chance or played bad.
---
Right?! His Snapchat would be lit tbh
---
I need a deadite killer in my life. Or the rift demon from season 3 that fused those two guys together and then used another guys spine/skull as a weapon.  (Ash vs Evil Dead).
---
Chucky/Tiffany could work as a team to hook survivors. It would take a little bit more on the animation side of things. But picture Chucky choking a survivor with a yoyo, riding them until they're impaled on the hook, and then tiffany cranks it up to hang them. 
---
You could also have a spectral sailor from The Fog, that could bellow fog from his person and reduce map visibility significantly.
---
He looks awesome!

&gt;Yeah surveillance doesn't work with surge only gens that you personally kicked. Not sure if that's supposed to be like that or it's just something the devs overlooked, but as of right now they don't work together.
---
Surveillance works with Surge, what are you talking about? The gens even became white on his footage.
---
"Blendette" is a term used for Claudette players who's game strategy is "pick a dark corner and crouch". They're infamously useless players, rarely seen working on gens and going down quickly in chases.
---
I laughed to hard at this
---
But what about this video?
---
https://youtu.be/fRdn8bozcUU
---
The survivor you're grabbing would have to be injured already though
---
Indeed
---
What happened here was, you triggered Surge on that generator but whoever was working on it, didn't let go off the generator when it exploded. 
---
If you don't let go off the generator it will show sparks coming out of it (as if it was regressing) but you can continue working on it just fine and the killer can't even kick it unless you tap it.
---
Yeah, but they dont become yellow when a survivor works on it.
---
Doesn‚Äôt nurse already have a hallowed blight skin?
---
Isn‚Äôt it a traditional Hannya mask that represents the darker side of ones feelings such as rage, jealously and betrayal? It looks amazing.
---
Self Care used to be meta, nowadays it wastes a lot of time and is only viable for solo survivors.
---
Sadly no
---
&gt;Yeah, but they dont become yellow when a survivor works on it.
---
The survivor didn't tap it. He continued working on it after Surge exploded the gen.
---
If you play against a high rank nurse or billy who isn‚Äôt running ruin, prepare yer anus.
---
Likely they aren‚Äôt running it because they have no need for it.
---
Survivors' teabagging was the first. And most survivors nowadays are toxic morons. I have played like 500 survivor hours, made it to rank 1 and haven't faced even a single truly toxic killer who was BMing by GF teabagging, Puking or nodding or hitting me on hook. A few killers did this, but only to my teammates who were BMing, so ye, killers do not do the toxic stuff unless survivors are fucking animals who provoke killers for this.
---
Nah for my 80 seconds are fine the problem stats when two survs work in the same gen
---
Maybe, but Doc has his shock therapy and could electrocute Myers like he does in his mori. I‚Äôm pretty sure just touching doc would hurt because all the electricity runs throughout his body, and stabbing him with a metal knife would probably do them both in.
---
Zero because the requirement is hard to impossible
---
First time tombstone and first time scratched mirror also are remarkable.
---
Well, mine isnt better
---
Teabagging and abusing people with messages are completely different, so i would suggest not lumping them together.
---
I disagree. First let me say, if it is in the game I am happy with it. Camping tunnelling whatever are all legit. The reason it is more toxic for a killer to do these, is because to do so they sacrifice their own game in order to ruin one survivors game. Either this or they are playing on the fact that the teamates will try and save them - which is not the best thing for survivors to do.
---
So yeah, I think that is way more toxic. I.e. someone pisses of the killer by havign a long chase and stunning them a couple of times. So they make sure that survivor dies at the cost of ruining their own game.
---
But saying that - do what you want. Flashlight and teabagging wouldn't be a problem if killers didn't let their game tilt. Because they essentially just waste survivor time.
---
It‚Äôs phrased perfectly fine, people are just deliberately misunderstanding it to be snarky. Like it‚Äôs super not hard to put 2 and 2 together on this one.
---
Then why wasn't it red when Thrilling Tremors activated?
---
That he does
---
I'm so excited ahhhhh I'm glad we're getting one since summer we got nothing at all, I'm buying Jakes leaked outfit too
---
So that is a bug.
---
But what about Thrilling Tremors?
---
I just find it so weird you'd attack a stranger over a misplaced comment. Lay off the spice bro it's geeking you out.
---
She boiled over David
---
Yesterday I already had three killers on rank 1 who DC'd when the exit gates were powered, even though as far as I can tell, the survivors weren't being toxic. So I find it hard to believe that you haven't met a single toxic killer in 500 hours since I see atleast one every day that I play.
---
Don't worry I'm near impervious to fetishes, except maybe the huntress. That ones got me. 
---
&gt;_&lt; jk
---
What's with this idea that a killer isn't allowed to have an endgame? Why exactly should they not have a perk that lets them come back from a bad game? When the generators are powered are they just supposed to put their weapons down and go open the gates for the survivor? The goal of the killer is to kill and secondarily to slow down the game enough so they can kill. There's no law that says a bad game needs to be punished because they suck and should be wiped off the face of earth for not being good. At the end of the day some abstract metric of skill doesn't matter as long as you complete the objective. I agree it needs to be balanced, maybe it doesn't activate when two or fewer survivors are still alive, but it's not unfair because it helps the killer
---
I need Pharmacy and Technician to complete the collection and shrine gives me alert and vigil.
---
&gt;Then why wasn't it red when Thrilling Tremors activated?
---
Because the generator was considered regressing even though someone was working on it. Like I said, you can continue working on the generator even while it has sparks coming out of it. 
---
Definitely a bug.
---
I mean, its not impossible, but I think some of you are clinging a liiiittle too hard to the dreams of a xenomorph being added any time in the near future.
---
Manners in a PvP game... now i've heard it all.
---
I understand this is a thing for the very high ranked who take this super competitive, but most people are just having fun. And most of those people are kids.
---
You shoudn't let it affect your game. Use it to your advantage. It is after all a strategical game, based on killing and surviving at all costs. If you let 'bad manners' effect your game, then they will continue.
---
Surveillance is underrated tbh, especially with killers who have low-map pressure.
---
Oh god now I can't unseen it. How dare you.
---
As a rank one player I'm sure you don't know since everyone runs the same 6 or so perks.
---
Don't lose your faith, spooktober is here, just jump in back to to game, there is hope.
---
Claudette is shaking of horror aahhaha
---
I sure as heck don‚Äôt. I run random builds that let me enjoy the game. If I pull off something hilarious, I just won the game :) if I fail, then I try again or try something else lol I play to laugh
---
SOL. But are you surprised that it runs low quality? I‚Äôm impressed it‚Äôs even on Switch.
---
How the demogorgon looks after getting no kills in a game
---
Only real gamers get this
---
Eh I dont think myers can be stopped
---
Well to be fair, the unhooker is almost always healthy (otherwise it's a stupid rescue) and you'd want to aim for the injured unhooked survivor over the healthy one. It's 1 hit to 2, and if it's BT it's still 2-2 with a chance of it being just 1.
---
/r/curledfeetsies
---
Multiple survivors on the same gen is actually less optimal than doing 3-4 at once, for a few reasons.
---
But a survivor with a nice toolbox that hits greats can do a gen in like 50 seconds.
---
I'd be a very happy girl if they made him a killer.
---
You're just waking along, and you finally down a survivor after 2 gens have already popped.
---
 But then that fucking David who thinks he's a god a lopping runs around the corner, T-bags then Flashlight saves.
---
I told him that what he wrote was wrong and he should learn English, nothing about that was an attack. If he feels like he has to be snarky about it I'll talk to him however I want to. Also please stop the reddit lingo, go somewhere else if you want to white knight and use that shit on people.
---
Yeah, while playing Laurie, just prepare to be slugged and make an unbreakable/flip flop/tenacity /boil over build.
---
You could also replace boil over by head-on and fake doing the locker-into-DS strat in front of the killer. He might hesitate to grab you from the locker long enough or decide to wait the hypothetical DS out so you can stun him instead.
---
Not going to be viable, but sure as hell will be funny.
---
Dead
---
Aww he looks like a depressed pumpkin
---
:)
---
Tehe
---
I am gonna have to level Nea to get urban evasion on everyone now. I am mildly traumatized LOL
---
I have no idea why so many people act like the toxic players are only on one side of the coin.
---
Awww how cute
---
they arent at all. ive ran into my fair share of toxic killers as well.
---
Fair point
---
Do go on
---
nah dude, I'm serious this skin flopped so hard in MY OPINION
---
&gt;How it is strategical to show off in a post game chat?
---
I didn't say this at all? It obviously isn't. People who chat shit are just assholes.
---
&gt;yes, I play only in Rank 1 and I try doing my best, because this is what brings me satisfaction.
---
Great!
---
&gt;The only thing I cannot understand is when they BM when the game is over. If they are "kids who are having fun" then fuck them and their parents, who are growing up a biotrash. And if being "rude" is as same as having fun for those people, then they are sick and I feel sorry for their families if they ever had one.
---
Honestly as someone who players survivor as well as killer. There really isn't meant to be that much toxicity in 'end of game teabagging' - and you will find many many new players doing this. Obviously sometimes, people are directly trying to piss off the killer, but this isn't usually done at the end of the game. The emotions that run through survivors at the end of the game after finally being somewhere safe are more about celebration and relief.
---
I refer to them as kids having fun, to demonstrate how pointless it is for you to get angry about it. You are the problem here, not because you think it is rude, but because you are letting it get to you. when I find them at the exit gate im all like "get outa here ya pesky kids!" then go for a few more points. If they want to hang around, great, fucking game on. The game is not over until they have left, and the amount of times I have seen cocky survivors get their comeuppance is hilarious. 
---
Don't get mad at people celebrating. It may be a 'norm' in this sub, but it isn't a good luck in reality. Just... Fuck em'.
---
And yes, being rude is having fun for many people, especially groups of people/ kids. Lie, did you ever experience public chat in COD 4 lobbies? Most DBD'ers wouldn't have lasted. Which is a shame because it is way more hardcore game.
---
I'd LOVE the Grunt from Amnesia! Imagine the same chase sound in DBD as in Amnesia
---
Like Wraith except with no need to decloak.
---
Bro, that was cringe. Gonna have to unfollow.
---
I take it you are also surprised when an AAA game doesn't look like the CGI used to promote it.
---
As a Pig main, I still think she's pretty good and fun to play as. That being said, sad oink noises indeed...
---
I would rage so mad...
---
I would love some more characters and outfits for when season 4 hits.
---
 Killer is a power role and it is in my power to kill a certain survivor, f.e.g. an OoO user or a guy who is a big nuisance for me. "Ruining a game" is very subjective term. For me "ruining a game" would mean keeping that certain survivor alive so he will continue making my game harder. No thanks, you are too dangerous to be kept alive.
---
And that is why no mercy shall be shown.
---
Laurie gets prettier everyday. xD
---
&gt;Zero because the requirement is hard to impossible
---
True. I even tried to make MoM work thanks to Inner Strength giving me quick heals but I still struggled. Even if you try to take hits while the killer is carrying someone, often times they refuse to hit you.
---
Hex ruin plss :p
---
Have they been announced already?
---
Looks like a lambant
---
Because that 20% is basically nothing, it wont make any difference in chases, not even if you use it correctly.
---
Warwick davis as leprechaun obvi
---
Does it affect vaulting?
---
i think he should have the power to shapeshift into things like monsters and paintings on walls and i think he should kind of be a stealth killer because of the scenes in the first movie when he was in paintings or shapeshifted into people watching him like in the library which would increase their fear level somewhat similar to to doctor
---
why though, why are we suddenly hating on spirit even though we haven't had a single problem with her before?
---
Not most, some
---
Most of the ones I get (green ranks)
---
ok but ash has been out ages now this is just about a new skin for him?
---
What I just witnessed was amazing
---
Little did the killer know that I was just standing their, menacingly, against the wall.
---
People hate face camping because it completely ruins the game for one player
---

My sides
---
Ruining a survivors game at the cost of your own - meaning, you are sacrificing yourself getting any points / pips in order to make sure a survivor you don't like has the same fate.
---
Because that is what extreme face camping and tunnelling gets you. 1 survivor who is pissed off, 1 salty killer who is just happy to kill that guy, and 3 survivors who have had a boring game and escaped.
---
self care is reduced heal speed, but it's only one survivor doing it, instead of 2 survivors immobilized during a faster heal.  Yes, a med kit would be better, but having teammates heal you really isn't better.
---
Why did I laugh at this
---
listen im aware it was probably gonna look a bit different than the poster but like its completely missing some things that were on the promotional poster, her horns aren't there and her mouth no longer looks like it could eat me whole, it just looks so tiny.
---
Anything Lena Dumbham says is poorly worded. lol
---
Or when being paired with almost any special infected
---
The event is no longer vial based apparently. Well, at least it doesn't say anything on the offering. [Pustula Petals Offering](https://i.imgur.com/F8CiOhy.jpg)
---
But also at the same time that phrase implies a group of people called "white men" are stupid and are living in a bubble. I mean I get that it's probably some catchphrase out of the context printed in some magazine, but it's still terribly phrased.
---
No I mean my old 360 doesn't have all its wires and my labtop is so crappy I get 3 frames whenever a zombie moves, so essentially I can't play it
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right. I use it on every killer I play. As soon as you sacrifice one person, it‚Äôs pretty hard to lose.
---
Many people have had a problem with her that's why so many people DC when they hear it is a spirit
---
This celebration is usually just being rude at the end. I do not consider this normal behaviour. It is the same as hit the last survivor on hook, nod and  spin around him. It is that what you call "celebration", but it all has the same meaning - showing off your victory.
---
Like the lunar event and 3 year anniversary event which was nice.
---
Had a game where two people farmed me for points by pulling me off the hook twice right after the killer put me on it. Hook, pull, hook, pull, hook, dead. After the game they tried to claim the killer was tunneling. They weren't. Those two were just running around the hook to farm me for points. When I sided with the killer they were calling toxic suddenly their attitude changed to "cry moar gg" and said I was just bad because I couldn't get away from being smacked down the second I got off the hook.
---
There is just no understanding some people.
---
Ah like always, trying to get a high tier killer to fet weaker.
---
This is a masterpiece of a drama if I‚Äôve ever seen one. Telenovelas ain‚Äôt got shit on this.
---
WOW... She totally saved your ass.
---
That was great!!
---
It's a bit different. In combat you go through the motions of what you've trained for.
---
Getting flashlight saved invokes a specific level of anger
---
&gt; her horns aren't there and her mouth no longer looks like it could eat me whole, it just looks so tiny.
---
????

https://youtu.be/zq5MM_xerdU?t=95

Something doesn‚Äôt look right about that flashlight- *wait*
---
my wallet was ready :( oh well guess i save some money
---
I don‚Äôt remember if they added this during or just as she released, but it‚Äôs stupid how many times a Spirit is able to hit or down me because they bumped into me
---
Why do you think I am ruining my own game by facecamping a certain guy, if I know for sure I am not having a good game if I don't kill him right now?
---
i am going to downvote this
---
This post is kinda stupid tbh, some people just want to win so they boost their chances by using meta perks. I would call someone bad if they do like meta builds but they dont know how to use them, they just use them cus they heard its good.
---
wraith has my favorite pallet stun noise and billy
---
The Shining is way too old of a film to be put in DBD.
---
And yes, one could argue Ash, Fred, Mikey, Bubba, and Ghosty are old as well...BUT each of them has a significantly recent remake/reboot.
---
You have to think of Behaviours target audience with this game. I mean damn, half the fan base doesn't even enjoy horror films. üòï
---
Gen rushing isn't the same as doing gens though. OP is saying that killers think just doing gens alone is toxic.
---
^^^^yakuyoke
---
Don't feed the trolls. No one legitimately gets this bent out of shape over something so miniscule, and if they actually are nothing you can say will make them stop spewing their lunacy. Just report him for being a jackass and move on.
---
I mean I'm no expert, but I'd probably sacrifice BBQ first. Legion's Feral Frenzy already gives them a lot of information on survivor's locations, so the reveal isn't as needed.
---
You do know this isn't accurate right? This a pretty bad render ngl this vid shows the actual in game model and it looks better https://youtu.be/zq5MM_xerdU
---
Spirit doesn't need balance changes. While I might agree with the Prayer Beads adjust, there's a reason it's iridescent rarity. And you already can't see scratch marks. Frankly, the more I read this, the more it seems you want to nerf Spirit into a shitty Nurse.
---
Never run self care purist here.  I also always run We'll Make It.  Not being able to heal myself has never really hurt my game, and being able to crazy fast heal others after I unhook them is a must.
---
I've been burned too many times by other survivors healing themselves.  I've had people refuse my healing and run off into a corner to heal themselves, wasting a ton of time.  Or worse, I'm on a hook, and as I slowly die all three other survivors are hiding and healing themselves.
---
Bonus big brain round; it's end game and it's quite obvious the killer has NOED, as they're downing everyone in one hit, and instead of capitalizing on the killer being absent and pulling a hooked teammate free, they fully heal themselves in the exit gates and *then* see if it's convenient to make any saves.
---
o..k didnt know there was a video on it since this image is all i found when looking around for an image of her model
---
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
---
That's the problem though is that calm spirit is useless because, in my experience anyway, doc's are incredibly rare... And infectious fright is a very good killer perk but it's so rare that it's also not worth it.
---
You're wasting a perk slot for the one game out of 30 where either of the two will be present.
---
These situational perks are good, but because killer is unknown they are useless.
---
This was less of a problem early on when we only had 3 killers... But these days there are a lot.
---
Weird, my SWF friends group only finds red killers now and we're levels 6, 12, 15, 15. I'm the 6 and my friends kicked me out of the group after 3 games pairing with killers leveled 3, 4 and 3.
---
I knew it would be rough with the matchmaking change to match killers based on the best rank but it's going even further than the best rank.
---
Yes but the Michael of the game is not of the same of dbd for that reason they can do new things with this Michael
---
Exactly. I am not claiming that survivors are innocent. I am saying that both sides can be toxic. But saying that only survivors are toxic is bullshit
---
Oh my god, you're completely right. I was thinking Mother-Daughter ring. I'll edit, thank you!
---
But the sweet double points though
---
My good sir, may we know the main build you run for both sides?
---
Spirit is not balanced because it forces you to use specific perks to counter her that otherwise is almost uncounterable when the game is supposed to promote different playstyles with equal chances to win. A nurse without add-on is still counterable even without specific add-ons.
---
And 9/10 times getting a 4k is because you were camping or tunneling. Ignore the iridescent Chaser emblem.
---
Tall killers have some issues with seeing survivors up close because their eyes are higher and they have to aim down to see you and because of the wide FOV. If you suddenly run into a killer, you'll most certainly confuse them for example.
---
Imagine sprinting in the open right off the bat then blaming BHVR because the killer instantly saw you.
---
I don't say gg when I destroy survivors and they have like 8k bps. It clearly wasn't a good game for them, don't need to rub it in. Basically I say gg only when at least some of them manage to escape, or when I get 4k, but it was a difficult game and they end up with ~20k bps.
---
well it makes more sense to camp slugged people since if you hook people they could have borrowed time and completely screw you over camping slugged people allows you to bait people more easily last monday i did this and i actually got a 4 man kill just from egc probably the best moment from my dbd career
---
It's Bad Manners. It's an age old term that I've been using since my early days in CS and Warcraft.
---
Agreed I laughed hard when OP compared to his 500 hours of him saying he has seen anything then claiming it‚Äôs a fact that cause he did not see it that means it does not exits. That‚Äôs like me and my friends who never get salty messages when we play killer that must mean in the OP logic that it does not exist lol
---
Played 2 hours as a survivor last night. Got disconnected randomly 6 times
---
I hit the survivors on the hook ONCE and that's immediately after hooking them because the scream annoys me, not because I'm trying to be toxic. Is that considered toxic?
---
Genuinely curious as I'm a terrible survivor, how is Spirit not counterable but Nurse is?
---
Oh I see, I misunderstood. That‚Äôd actually be pretty cool, if they could add some kind of insight on how Michael is adjusting to the entity‚Äôs realm. I sort of doubt they‚Äôll do any kind of licensed archives though, especially with Halloween being their earliest license.
---
It‚Äôs used in Overwatch and Smite. I guess it‚Äôs almost any game that has some kind of comms or chat, are team based, or have any real way to have bad behavior towards others (teabagging, laugh spamming, pinging, etc.)
---
People also seem to forget that Steve is a fucking athlete. Legion are barely high school delinquents. The only thing similar between Steve and Legion are that they‚Äôre teenagers.

There was a David in a game yesterday that had a similar build and I'm fairly certain he crawled nearly as fast as he walked.
---
Sometimes knocking out a generator with 2 people is worth the little bit of time waste, especially if it's a generator in a bad spot. Like next to the basement, or in the center of the map.
---
I don't mind they knowing where I am when they are moving at basic speed and are easily loopable
---
I mind them knowing where I am when they are invisible and move at 2 times the speed.
---
Yeah, it sucks :p
---
Where does it say you‚Äôre stupid and living in a bubble? I don‚Äôt see that anywhere. That seems a lot like your personal interpretation, but as it‚Äôs written it‚Äôs pretty easy to get a more reasonable meaning out of it. Not really worth arguing about though.
---
it looks like he teleported
---
I can feel the pain
---
You know how many baseball games I lost as a kid? Pretty much all of them. My team still went and gave high fives and said gg to the other team after every game.
---
That's what I'm saying basically. The right way to say is that women are oppressed not that white men are dumb. 
---
And besides, you can't just tell white men as a group don't know how it is to be attacked at the same time as attacking white man as a group lol.
---
I didn‚Äôt specific, but I just meant like add-ons or items. Perks are fine, use whatever
---
I saw your user flair so I was automatically more inclined to read your post. Then I finished reading your post and I love you even more. We need more of your attitude in the game. It‚Äôs just a game. It‚Äôs silly to get emotional about things in the game
---
Man, **** Surge.
---
Thana
---
Whispers: no
---
Did they up the chance to Kobe? I‚Äôve had like 3 this week alone and barely have been playing
---
pretty much on the same platform as myers juuuust below the top tier.
---
If I see them t-bagging, I just run to the other side of the map and then get up to get a snack or use the restroom.
---
Now this is my kind of humor, I wish I had gold to give to you
---
Eh, to be honest, I don't really care if people t-bag or do this stuff in the first place. But you have to hold the same standards. If you think survivors doing one t-bag is toxic, then hitting them once on the hook should also be considered toxic etc.
---
I honestly agree. I don't think the problem is with Ruin, I think the problem is with how easy it is to do generators with the mechanics the way they are. If a killer can't end a chase in 20 seconds, he loses two generators at minimum against a competent team. Which means he now needs to DOUBLE down on the map pressure and make up the entire game of something that's essentially out of his control. At the beginning of a game with all the pallets up, a smart survivor is going to run him like a madman every time.
---
SB and lithe? Are you doing random perks?
---
Pop goes the weasel
---
Who takes a hit with bt when the rescuer is healthy? That argument is pretty bad, you should be hitting the rescuer as they go to save then hitting them again, if the bt guy takes a hit, then the rescuer should still be closer because of the speed boost the bt guy gets, and injured. And if you worry about ds so much  that your idea of playing around it is to get rid of it as soon as possible, then you're both not playing optimally (slugging/targeting rescuer) but probably tunneling the shit out of survivors. This just sounds like really convoluted, flawed logic to make you feel better about tunneling.
---
Yeah it fucks with stealthy and non-stealthy killers too.
---
When I am not enjoying a game I turn the troll mode ON and do whatever it takes to make the game end faster.   
---
The reasons may be: I get outplayed too hard, some OP shit in the game.
---
If I don't want to prolongue the game I open the gates, let them farm, avoid tryhard, etc... But I am no hardcore player and don't care about ranks, pip or depip. If this isn't your case or if players using OoO happens too often in your games, this probably is useless to you.
---
&gt; Where does it say you‚Äôre stupid and living in a bubble?
---
But who else would you be if you don't reckon that women are oppressed?
---
Wow. Just imagine killers fighting each other. Holy hell that would be EPIC
---
No I get the hit part. It‚Äôs those who duck out before the hit.
---
"a small price to pay for salvation"
---
I completely agree, while it sucks when I'm the one being camped at the end, I completely respect it.  
---
I also completely respect people who don't, and when I play killer and they unhook in front of me (Idk how I'm super noob at killer lmao) I respect that too.  
---
I don't know why anyone gets angry at people for doing reasonable things in this game.  
---
I'm just glad I don't see too much toxicity, though that may be because I do swf lol
---
All work and no play...
---
Actually the title should be, "I blame the game i am playing for these issues even tho its clearly bad connection"
---
The ending was terrible to me but my best friend loved it. After some discussion he eventually got me to admit it was pretty good, I just kinda didn't want to admit it was and it just wasnt something I was expecting. I'd go into more detail but I would never spoil my favorite series of all time
---
I would cry.
---
They both are counterable but require different playstyles to counter.
---
Spirit for example, against good ones you throw pallets early and mindgame that pallet to win chases etc. Most of the community who moans about Spirit cannot do this.
---
Nurse is good old LoS, say you're at a jungle gym loop and you have something like Iron Will or Quick and quiet, you can confuse the Nurse into making her blink wrong. There is counterplay to both, just people refuse to do it.
---
If they can't loop the killer that killer is deemed broken or OP.
---
FYI, only Spirit and Nurse can deal with all the BS survivors can bring, but DW, nerf them both so it's impossible for Killers to win vs strong SWF groups, because that definitely should be the case!!
---
But its october?
---
KEKW
---
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make it right!

&gt;It is the same as hit the last survivor on hook, nod and spin around him

Because of the point he so fast is the problem. Not only would he be the fastest killer in the game without earning it in any way, he can still hit people. What do you want the devs to do? Remove wraith?

I'm Canadian and what is this? Werebeaver, weremoose and weremallard? And Susie as WereQueenofEngland?
---
Ooo nice!
---
I‚Äôll give it a go. Sounds like a good setup (and fits how I usually play her haha)
---
Hag? I‚Äôm getting that
---
It's stuff or be stuffed
---
Why would you ever touch that subreddit. It's the most cursed thing I have ever seen
---
My idea about swf matchmaking was that if a survivor is red rank and another one is green ranks, the killer will be purple rank to balance both ranks but I don't have a problem with this.
---
CRUNCH CRUNCH
---
They're dicks. Lulz
---
This community be like: *fIx MaTcHmAkInG*
---
&gt;If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
Also this community: *"gUyS i CaN't GeT a GaMe, ItS bEeN 3 yEaRs QuEiNg"*
---
Iron will for sure. Dont always wake up immediately. Try not to save with borrowed if the hooked survivor has DS.
---
Rank reset is dumb. I face almost no resistance while climbing till red ranks but spend most of my time below rank 5 stomping because I don't play enough to maintain a high rank
---
Because you can see where the nurse is about to blink to which gives you a very small time frame to try and dodge her.
---
You have absolutely no idea where the spirit is going to phase and it's literally a guessing game as survivor whereas the spirit has all the advantages because she can A) see your scratch marks and if they suddenly stop she knows where you are. B) she can hear you and your foot steps which renders trying to walk away useless. C) She has collision with survivors when phasing so even if she doesn't know where you are but luckily bumps into you she gets a free hit.
---
Bruh moment
---
It really depends on whether the survivor or killer mains see the post first, I think. But while you're right about promoting different playstyles, it's really hard to balance that with the killer's abilities. And I also think Spirit should be able to hear and "feel" you while shifting because she doesn't get to do it instantly like Nurse does (i.e. Nurse first finds you/knows where you are and then blinks, Spirit has to find you while shifting). To be fair, if Spirit is shifting and you're not bleeding, you can theoretically crouch-walk and hide somewhere and she won't hear you.
---
At least it doesn‚Äôt affect tier 1 myers
---
The blame game is real and so is selfishness. No body wants to own their play style and then they say game makes them toxic.
---
I had a lighter, we have photos of me lighting the molotov and the cigarette lit up. I just don't smoke so didn't really want to keep smoking.

Imagine being this fucking stupid

No no I mean in the game. Please don't smoke for the sake of a picture :(
---
I actually love this ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
When did white people face discrimination? Don't give vague descriptions.
---
Anything in this game is toxic with how losely the community uses the term, you load in to the game? Toxic! You hook someone? Toxic! You do a gen? Toxic! No matter what its a losing battle because the ones saying it will never see both sides of the coin and simply defend their pov to their death.
---
It fixed the EGC timer.
---
Amen!
---
For me it's the same as saying women can't understand math and management on a deep psychological and that they aren't stupid at the same time. Empathy and compassion are really basic things for an adult regardless of their sex and skin color (even yet again omitting the suggestion that men were never attacked in their life)
---
Too bad they changed cankers to gens. It was fun to collect them and there was more things to do for survivors
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Doc is straight up cute lol
---
Hey man, if you wanna stay injured when I play plague, go ahead. Lol thantophobia, ruin, and dying light will make it a real short game.
---
Bahahahah lettuce, that's great.
---
I just got the game like a month ago and I got hag just to grind for ruin, but wound up actually really liking her. Been wanting the lettuce skin, but I just saw the new skin leak and can't justify buying lettuce head when I can get a good skin soon :c
---
Exactly. I'm a low-rank Spirit main. Survivors who just crouch next to an unused pallet, waiting for me to walk over, get downed quickly. Survivors who loop properly and don't fall for mindgames escape me easily.
---
No. I'll continue  to hate.
---
The beret has the exact patch Bill sports, I got it custom made for it. The only thing I'd agree with you on Is It needed to be shaped better but kind of hard when It's weathered and dirty.
---
Interesting, I will definitely try out surveillance
---
I told myself I'd only get Ghostface to P2 and then promptly spent the entire bloodhunt getting him to P3 50 and doing nothing useful with the points
---
The wish noise is already non directional tho

That was what I thought would be a good one could get faster games as well. Games take so long now lol hopefully when the event hits games will come faster
---
Hitting those key notes. Which is why October is my favorite month
---
lol that subreddit has twice as many moderators as it does posts
---
Well you have a week for get 230 shards. Should be easy.
---
Although I don't think 2000 shards for 150k blood points is a good deal at all. In fact, it's pretty terrible.
---
True!
---
I mean, we SHOULD buff Boil over.
---
Hell no. Not a chance.
---
1. So you aren't dumb if you don't understand what it's like to be under an attack?
---
2. That's what I'm basically saying, so somehow I obviously can.
---
I hope they‚Äôll make those rusty parts shiny like the cosmetic for Claud last year (just like the big picture you see this skin in). I know other may not favor it‚Äôs visibility, but I think it‚Äôs a nice touch myself. 
---
Even if they don‚Äôt, it still looks great.
---
Depends if you want perks or new killers. Since you already have BBQ if you were going for perks I'd say Clown for Bamboozle and PGTW. If you were going for new killer to play I'd say Legion, I personally think he's fun to play as, plus he also has Discordance. Mad Grit and Iron Maiden aren't terrible perks either.  Doctor also has some pretty good teachable perks, so it all kinda just depends on your playstyle. I'm personally not a big fan of playing doctor, but his perks are good.
---
If you want perks, get clown. Bamboozle and Pop are both top tier perks as a whole. Legion has Discordance which is very good for helping locate survivors and Doctor has M&amp;A which is really good for stealth killers, Plague and overall is just a nice perk to have. If you are going for fun, personally go for Doctor or Legion because both of their abilities are easy and fun to use. Clowns ability is really bad imo and is all in all really boring to use. Extra points go to Doctor because his ability grants the most bloodpoints without add ons in the game for just playing.
---
*undertsle flashbacks*
---
if you are good enough you could get all 4? Committing to one just means you are limiting yourself.
---
Like the amount of times we have had a short game because of this. This is how a SWF voice chat would go if you camped a survivor:
---
Survivor 1:  Aw man he finally got me
---
Survivor 2: I‚Äôm coming to save you bro!
---
Survivor 3/4: Cool, we‚Äôll just move onto the next gen
---
Survivor 1: He‚Äôs just face camping me guys, don‚Äôt bother trying. Get the game finished.
---
Survivor 2: Yeah I tried to get an opening but he won‚Äôt leave at all. I‚Äôm just on a geny now.
---
Survivors 3 &amp; 4: Ah man, that sucks. Well we‚Äôll just finish this game quickly so we can get you for the next one.
---
All the while you are staring this guy in the face while genys are popping on left right and center. 
---
I mean... Do what you want. But to me that is compeltely different to a couple of survivors either taunting / distracting a killer by crouching to get them to chase. Or celebrating at the end of a game -  which as you said, is basicially the same as what killers do by hitting survivors and nodding, spamming their abilities.
---
I personally quite like that. It's like a fuck you I finally caught you, you wriggly son of a ***.
---
Thanks man! Mych appreciated üëç
---
I'd say no. I bought bubba for bbq and I rarely play him. Clown is nice for pop and bamboozle.
---
Wow now THIS is a shitpost.
---
id say so, cloaking and uncloaking is a pretty big bonus
---
I didn't say it is okay for killers to bm. I'm only saying that most killers play toxic only when survivors start this mess. Your anger full message kinda proves my point, since you just accuse me for being a hypocrite, even though I'm not, just because you disagree with me.
---
I just want them to remove that stupid smoke, litterly, just that one little change would be so good.
---
The joke was just not funny
---
As a bad Spirit main, while your individual points are valid, this doesn't always mean a bad Spirit can win a chase. If you're running in a straight line, yes, she will get you. If you start looping and vaulting and running to create scratch marks and crouch-walk back to confuse the killer, they will not find you as easily. Additionally, the collision can actually be confusing -- I once stopped phasing to hit a "survivor" and realized that it was a fucking barrel.
---
Im already Huntress
---
It seem both, where trolling as in *haha killer u suck!*
---
How to not get fucked by rank 1 survivors that are in swf?
---
Oh ffs, now everytime I hear "white men" it's Myers's face I'll see in my head
---
Properly tapping a gen gets you 18-20 points per tap. That person is doing it wrong. This guy does it in 103 seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm2FBVvu2ro It's really easy to do it too. It's more like you're spending only 80% of the time on it.
---
I said 75 seconds if you hit greats because I forgot you don't get the bonus with ruin up. :)
---
If we ever get Jack Torrance he won't look like Jack Nicholson. He'll be another generic gremlin like Quentin. I doubt BHVR would get the image rights to Nicholson.
---
Mid chapter 13? 13th chapter like a killer right?
---
Tru, his whines are omnipresent.
---
I haven't noticed any change in SWF matchmaking. My lower rank friend still seems to dictate the matchmaking. And on the fairly infrequent occasions I play solo I tend to play with teammates who are 10 ranks lower than I am.
---
I'll be Spirit.
---
But how will you be able to tell that you have no terror radius?!
---
Lmaoo
---
Warts all over her are awesomely gross. Some of them are even swole around her bandages, pretty amazing attention to detail even if her mask isn‚Äôt quite like the banner art.
---
Don‚Äôt even get me started on the feet.
---
Nerf Spirit!
---
So much anxiety just watching this
---
Demogorgon isn't exactly the most "horror icon" character either, and while people still know it, it's not as iconic as Ghostface or other "horror icons". So it doesn't inherently have to be the most horror films thing but if it's still within the realm of that genre and at least fairly well known I think it's within the realm of possibility.
---
Holy fuck it‚Äôs not that hard to understand. Men have never been attacked for being men. Men have never been in a position of subordination for being men. Never, not even once in the entire history of the universe
---
Every other post game chat for me is like:

no wonder you see survivors as super toxic, if you equate my message to being full with anger.
---
because he got it off, you can't escape when wearing the mask lol  
---
If you check the comments OP explains what happened
---
I thought I was in r/4PanelCringe

&gt;be ghostface

&gt;dude has OoO
---
&gt;catch him
---
&gt;facecamp this ass
---
&gt;gens are done, but luckily i have an opportunity to win
---
&gt;catch another guy, go and open exit gates
---
&gt;luckily they wasted their only instaheal
---
&gt;half of the timer left
---
&gt;1/3
---
&gt;it is time
---
&gt;they keep teabagging and running near me while i carry their teammate to hook
---
&gt;I hang him 
---
&gt;leave cuz it doesn't matter anymore
---
&gt;they run to the exit gates
---
&gt;10 seconds
---
&gt;9 seconds
---
&gt;8 seconds
---
&gt;7 seconds
---
&gt;they are on the verge of escaping and i just brake a pallet
---
&gt;Wanna know why?
---
&gt;Bloodwarden.
---
I run bbq ruin enduring and spirit fury. With iridescent button it‚Äôs disgusting and I‚Äôve gotten so many downs purposely feral frenzy-ing through a pallet while getting hit. Then just getting a free m1 from spirit fury
---
I camp hooked survivor only when i have 3 gens around it.
---
Not at all.
---
Had a game yesterday where I was playing huntress for the dailies and I am a horrible huntress. I get absolutely bullied, looped and teabagged after every pallet and to top it off I forgot I brought no Ed just incase this match went wrong and I just let them walk past me to the gates.
---
NOED is a shit perk because it is entirely dependent on the survivors‚Äô mistakes whether or not you get any use out of it. You either kill all of them before it activates, they don‚Äôt do totems and then it activates, or they do totems and it doesn‚Äôt activate. 2/3 scenarios where it doesn‚Äôt matter and you‚Äôre essentially playing with three perks, it‚Äôs not worth using.
---
Adrenaline is a great perk because there‚Äôs zero downside to it, if the gates get powered you will get the effects of Adrenaline no matter what. As long as somebody on your team holds down M1 long enough you will reap the rewards of this perk. You either get the gens done or you don‚Äôt there is nothing that‚Äôs gonna get in the way of Adrenaline except your team not knowing you should be on gens every second the killer isn‚Äôt chasing you. There‚Äôs no reason not to use it
---
NOED is meant to be a comeback perk 
---
Adrenaline is meant to be an insurance perk
---
Stop comparing them because I‚Äôm really sick of seeing people claim that doing gens is as hard as juggling all four survivors.
---
On the other hand, people would only do cankers which meant that anybody wanting to play a normal game was screwed.
---
Sounds like a solid sarcasm for me
---
:O
---
If you want Franklin's and Knockout (or u just like Bubba) then go for it. 
---
If ur what I call Perkwhoring, I'd get Clown next bc Bamboozle and PGTW are pretty good perks. Doc is a good choice for M&amp;A, especially on Nurse bc you can combine MA with NC to see healing Survivior auras outside of your terror radius. Legion is okay but only Discordance is his good perk.
---
Who says Anybody needs killer ash is the only thing dbd needs, i don t care about perks, map, killer, i only care about ash fucking williams
---
he is literally nothing like the Hillbilly
---
Ikr? Its so important, because there is literally no way to know if you have your terror radius or not (except the undetectable status effect, lower placed camera and the fact that you manually pressed Ctrl to crouch)
---
You're right. So, Hillbilly.

Weird that the Switch doesn‚Äôt support hosting when a majority of Switch online play relies on P2P
---
Descended into hell?
---
The animation ascends you though.....
---
Even when the entity come out of the ground to get you, it only hold you up. 
---
The only time you go downward is when you take the hatch.
---
I approve of that momentary moonwalk he did.
---
I think it should break pallets also make the sane terror radius small not gone
---
I used to run that but I don‚Äôt have any iridescent Buttons left so I need to use a build that works better with worse addons.
---
Definitely depends on how much of the Legion has been influenced by The Entity, and if the Demogorgon is still the same.  
---
If Legion are big papa compared to being edgy knife weilding teens, then it will be a fun fight 
---
If Legion are small poppy, then they're gonna get shitstomped lmfao 
---
***Demogorgon traits*** 
---
*  Extremely tanky, even in an infantile state they are highly resilient to damage ( Demodogs ) 
---
* some are rumored to have telekinetic powers similar to 11 ( check the wiki ) 
---
*  the only surefire way of destroying them is insane amounts of energy ( enough to rip a hole inbetween dimensions ) 
---
* they are primal creatures, and as such, they can be lured into traps and other such shenanigans 
---
* They can be imprinted on and possibly trained to be obedient, as shown in season 3 Dart very clearly recognized Dustin towards the end, and personally even though it was clear the Dog was hungry, I still think that's a sign that they are intelligent enough to eventually be trained ( so they might recognize the other killers, and it's possible some of the more menacing killers can train them  ) 
---
* Extremely hard to escape from them ( Able to sense blood through Gaps between Dimensions ) 
---
* Superhuman strength when under the influence of the shadow monster ( it's safe to assume that these things are definitely strong enough to hunt solo, but they also gain a ***lot*** of strength from the Mind Flayer, similar to how Will was basically able to rip through his restraints and choke out his mom ) 
---
It ain't lookin too good lol
---
***Legion traits*** 
---
* Numbers advantage, there's four, do I have to say more
---
* Extremely close together, it's safe to assume that they can easily work together as a team judging from their lore and how they are called The Legion
---
* Leadership qualities, they are able to rally to Frank ( I think that was the leads name idr ) even when they think it might not be the best idea 
---
* Can go Feral and ignore their logical thinking ( When they murdered the guard not all of them wanted to do it, but in the end they all tore into the guy ) 
---
* It's safe to assume they can stay in this Feral state until they either pass out from exhaustion, or are incapacitated ( Games fatigue from missing, and Pallet stun ) meaning they can do some serious damage if a fight goes on for too long 
---
* One of them is literally carrying a broken ruler, but I'm assuming this can be traded for one of the other's spare knives in cases where things need to get serious ( because basically anything can puncture human skin if it's pointy enough )
---
( We're gonna assume they got the powers from the entity to make this fight much more enjoyable btw, and as such that means they will have access to the perks within the game, I will note some higher likely things they could be bringing with them for this fight, or things that would already be in play ) 
---
* Hex totems won't work, most of them work through the emotions of prey, and this usually attones to survivors 
---
* We are going to assume they come with the abilities augmented from The Entity, but those all kind of suck ass for this fight, but since I want a more interesting fight anyways, lets assume they've been in the Fog for a while and have been helped by the other killers ( Teachables ) 
---
* Brutal strength, assuming this works how I think it does, it greatly augments their strength, so with a high-ball I would say they each are a little bit weaker than Demogorgon ( which is still saying a lot ) 
---
* Resilient lets them power through, making it even harder to incapacitate them 
---
* Save the best for last, assuming the Demogorgon would either incapacitate one of them or greatly injure one, the others would become obsessed with killing it, this can be thrown out by group decision though, should it be thrown out this could be replaced with unrelenting which essentially works the same way ( but different in game for obvious reasons ) 
---
* And good ol Sloppy Butcher, causing their attacks to be even more violent 
---
Still, the fight is heavily in the Demogorgon's favor, the Entity never gave the Killer's buffs to direct resilience because it never saw the reason to. As such the Legion are essentially glass cannons. A lot of the fight boils down to whether or not the Knives can pierce it's skin, if they can then they have a good chance, but seeing how Submachine gun fire left no visible impact on the beast, and Sbeve didn't really do anything other than stun the creature, which given how it was probably in the midst of sensory overload ( no eyes, people screaming, lights flickering, gunshots, etc ) getting slammed in the side of the head with a spikey piece of wood would most definitely scare the shit out of you. 
---
It is also safe to assume that if the Demogorgon was also augmented with the abilities from The Fog, it would Shitstomp legion into the ground, especially considering it's already as powerful as it is
---
Did i say killers do this every game? Don't think so
---
The holocaust?
---
Finally some good fucking post on this sub
---
Stranger Things is a recent multi million dollar story. And while there were a few who didn't know of ST before the release of this chapter, I feel those people may have been living in a pineapple under the sea. ST is EVERYWHERE. At Burger King, at Dunkin, at Target, on Instagram, on YouTube. 
---
My point was it needs to be recent. Their target audience needs to know of something in order to be like, "oh wow okay I'll go for this game."
---
What did he say
---
Lol, you've never been above Rank 10 have you?
---
&gt; Spirit for example, against good ones you throw pallets early and mindgame that pallet to win chases etc. 
---
Imagine thinking this works. Spirit has no animation tied to her phase. If you throw a pallet and the Spirit stands still, you have no idea if she's phasing at you, or just standing there waiting for you to slow vault the pallet right into her arms. If you just stand there, or try moving around the loop, she'll just bump into you when she actually starts phasing. This will not work even against the low-rank Spirits and is the worst suggestion I've seen for countering a spirit. The only thing you can do in this situation is walk away from the loop after she stand still when you've thrown the pallet. Even then, she just has to stand still and delay her actual phase to watch you do that, or if you're injured, she'll see/hear you doing it anyway. 
---
&gt;Most of the community who moans about Spirit cannot do this. 
---
Amazing. Please post a video of you vs red rank spirit and give us some tips on how to "juke" her.
---
nah cankers were not infinite. Everyone would eventually return to gens. I like them more than gens. I hope at least gens will look like big cankers or sorta thing
---
Yeah you definitely feel it when you play against survivors who don't dc vs a spirit - the ones who are actually good at the game.
---
Playing Against Spirit is a challenge for both sides 100% and no offence meant to you, but when you play against a bad Spirit you just... Know it, you know? So when that happens you have to change your playstyle again because new Spirits typically play different to experienced ones.
---
I'm ngl here, but if you went to me "Hey do you want to play against a Rank 1 Spirit, Rank 1 Nurse or a Rank 10 Trapper?" I would say "I'd rather play ahainst the Nurse or the Spirit 100 times before playing against the Trapper." To me, in every fucking map, I hate Trapper, I don't find him fun or intuitive, but do I DC? No. Because how the fuck do I learn to not be scared by his traps?
---
Yet here we are on a post on the subreddit
---
Just imagine if killers could injure you by jumping on top of you. Just one STOMP and instead of not noticing there was david he would scream and get downed lmao
---
Damn! This looks so good, I thought it was a cosplay at first!
---
I will actively end my own life if that shows up before Ghostface gets oblivious
---
Then don't even bother with events. If the event is "completely normal gameplay with a mild amount of more flair" then why should anyone give a shit?
---
Also, people shit their pants in normal games anyway so what's the difference, really?
---
Its nice that you've created a completely situational scenario where everything goes in your favour. But if you are a rank 1 killer, you should know that facecamping is not a good strategy. 
---
This won't happen every game. And if you have that perk set up - you can literally do that anyway, whether you facecamp or not. But if you don't facecamp you are likely to make the game slower (meaning harder for the survivors, and also meaning more points for everyone) and also more likely to kill more survivors before all geny's have been activated.
---
He got that Diabetes to Type 2 with high cholesterol levels.
---
I saw somewhere that she's the least played, but the most lethal. Not sure where tho
---
It does work and I've been Rank 1 on both Killer (Huntress, Billy, Legion, Pig and Nurse) and Survivor every reset of the new ranking system and I never 2/3/4 stack SWF cause that'd be too easy. It's not hard, you're just bad.
---
I think its from the Dbd wiki page
---
No, that is what I said. And you said "how?". What do you mean how? How do they hit your body at the end of the game? By pressing the button.
---
Easy to talk shit. Where's the proof?
---
Ad hominem.
---
Surely this won't happen every game. But I recall at least 10 games, where everything went to this hyperbolised scenario. Except it wasn't 4k, rather then 2-3k. People rarely expect bloodwarden and if you do things quickly, they won't escape.
---
Believe that‚Äôs part of the lore expansion
---
Wait she has a new skin?
---
If only I got teammates like these!
---
Semites aren't in the category of "White People". We are talking Europe and U.S. / Canada here
---
Why is everyone saying Plague looks bad? She looks awesome...
---
I played the wraith in the game map + there were two claudettes camping hatch. I heard one of them breathing and I shit you not I was staring directly at her, knowing exactly where she was, and could NOT see her.
---
I slapped her just to make sure I wasn't insane and sure enough she was there, but Jesus Christ she was literally invisible.
---
Both actually because nothing wrong with all gens getting done in 1m 43s
---
Which actually makes sense, since the Entity wants the survivors to have a chance as well, as shown by the hatch, because it feeds on strong emotions, including the survivors' hope. Hence it would actually weaken the Demogorgon quite a bit, and so, the DbD Demogorgon is quite likely to lose against all four Legion.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you use an exhaustion perk?
---
He's so cute omg
---
Considering you're so against her, where's your gameplay of facing Spirit and being shit on so we can educate you on how to play against her?
---

Then don't use the perk.

The same reason you can use skins in any first person point of view game. Some people like looking good
---
I don't get it I'm lostüò≠
---
They really gotta increase the amount of perks in the shrine, there's just so many teachables, it's hard to get the one you really want.
---
Myers or any killer injected with Hallowed Blight
---
Damn u guys I was just trying to make a stupid joke
---
We need a spitter skin for the Plague
---
If im playing killer and a survivor decides to T bag, then he/she just made things personal. Forget winning the game. Its more satisfying face camping and tunneling them. Gotta punish the people that make this game and overall gaming so toxic.
---
Lena Dunham is  a hypocrite and really fucking gross.
---
I only think bt should still work properly.
---
Bloodwarden is great for that. And im glad you found something that workds for you. But that has nothing to do with facecamping being a good strategy? 
---
And how can you be angry at people who gen rush, but claim that facecamping is legitimate and you can have a good game? That is literally what happens if you facecamp. You are saying to survivors "Please gen rush me, I'm not bothering checking gens".
---
Why would they immediately switch targets just because another survivor runs past. They were already chasing a target survivor. Switching too frequently is not productive of a strategy (and this is coming from a survivor main)
---
I have no idea why they don't do this. Just average it towards higher ranks if need be, but just flat out ignoring the low level ranks in the group really makes it hard to try and bring friends into this game. It's already hard convincing friends to play this game when they get tunneled and face camped because the sweaty killer notices they're the weak link.
---
Haha nice!
---
I was actually thinking about doing this.  Sounds fun

I can‚Äôt stand huntress with her overgrown toes kicking pallets

They only changed 2 Nurse's addons?
---
Stupidest thing I've read today. You don't ask someone to prove a negative. Either post your gameplay showing us your rank and your skills against the spirit, or stop making out like you're billy big dick survivor.
---
Also, you've yet to confirm whether you;re on console or not, 'cause if you are then your argument is irrelevant.
---
Not unless you want some not really cool skins that is all prestige gives you
---
I actually forgot about the field of view increase.  I‚Äôll give these a shot
---
Those toes look like they've gotten an ouchie
---
I already got plague doctor and that one uncommon black and red skin
---
I find this post mildly amusing. Upvote.
---
It's like basing a power entirely around RNG is a bad idea.
---
You are the player we all love. Who may not enjoy it, but plays anyway just to be fair. I fucking *hate* playing against Freddy and Pig but I still do it because I don't want to be an asshole. So as a killer main, thank you so very much. Also, no offense taken, as I am fully willing to admit that I suck as Spirit. :-)
---
You get to stare at a slightly more interesting back for 10 minutes while you wait for a lobby.
---
DS, Dead hard, Urban evasion, mettle of man.
---
The animations are (mostly) awesome, but being able to hook someone a single time and then just completely remove them from the game is really dumb, unfun and not even remotely balanced.
---
I'm challenging you to find something a thousand percent worse.
---
FIX THE GODDAMN PARTY SYSTEM ON CONSOLES! I'M SICK OF HAVING TO RELOAD DUE TO THE CONSTANT CRASHES I JUST WANT TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS!!!
---
Laughs as Freddy
---
It's called "Finale" and it's 1080 cells, of course.
---
I really hope so. Legion is my guilty pleasure killer... can't win shit with him on mid to high ranks... but still love the slasher gang. Just some little buffs here and there would be highly appreciated. Right now they got raped hard by swfs.
---
As of current it‚Äôs only the second meaning rank reset hasn‚Äôt occurred. Probably a bug (btw don‚Äôt hate on me for this but I play on switch so that might have something to do with it?)
---
Ahahahaha
---
Is assumed so. Very Rare then?
---
I miss old enduring tbh. Now only good with spirit fury and thats about it.:(
---
That's right
---
This is next level.
---
I thought it was fair I got both outfits for Dwight and the Asian chick and then just enough for one killer I got doc over trapper.
---
He lost all credibility as soon as he asked you for proof and then went "DoN't AsK mE tO PrOvE a NeGaTiVe" as soon as you went "no u" XD
---
Yeah I can. Jumping on a coaster would probably be broken though.
---
2X BLOOD POINTS ONLY LASTED FOUR FUCKING DAYS AND I RARELY EVER GOT INTO A MATCH AS KILLER!!!  SO MUCH FOR DEDICATED SERVERS!!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°üòõ
---
the one at the top is the one they used on twitter while the one on the bottom is the one in-game. super trivial i know, just something i noticed
---
Bloody Coil? Yes. All his traps? No, but he should start with 3, and be able to carry at least 2 at all times. Starting with all the traps allows him to turn approximately half the map into a killzone.
---
Speak for yourself, I'm headed out
---
When you look behind you, reverse your controls in your head. Left is right, right is left, forward is back and back is forward
---
I think it would be fair if the camped surviour gets extra bloodpoints for distracting the killer.
---
You mean Jan 1st- Dec 31st?
---
Master Nurse, Spirit, Fred, or Billy.
---
Are you speed hacking at the end? It looks so weird.
---
"I'm Stuff" memes don't deserve propper grammar.
---
Very true
---
They are not similar at all. Like, please make that case.
---
&gt;  i would compare him to the hillbilly he has high mobility
---
For one, Demo does not have "high mobility." It has map pressure via its portals. Mobility and map pressure can go hand in hand (like with Billy) but not necessarily so (like with Demo).
---
Additionally, Billy's pressure and mobility is fully in the hands of the player. Demo is, to various extents, at the mercy of survivors.
---
&gt; and an ability that charges at survivors he is basically a faster hillbilly
---
OP is referring to the charge speed here, but Shred is way weaker than the Chainsaw. Despite taking longer to charge, the Chainsaw comes with legitimately high mobility and an instadown. Shred does not have an instadown and is, frankly, easier to dodge than the Chainsaw and cannot be maneuvered like the Chainsaw to match survivor movements.
---
So, pray tell, how is Demo comparable to Billy in any way?
---
She went head on on him
---
Mettle of man... METTLE OF MAN????
---
I mean I really wonder if he thinks Nurse with No Addons is OP?? Oh BTW there was a dev update recently and only Nurse's addons are being changed!
---
The MASSIVE takeaway from this story is that the devs KNOW that Baseline Nurse is BALANCED?!? I'm in a fever dream, I love it!!
---
MY BOY, Jake mains assemble
---
Ok, hand fetish.
---
honestly an undead survivor theme would be sick
---
theres actually a lot of that on BOTH sides
---
Which explains why the Demogorgon didn‚Äôt get one. That sounds like a one-way track to getting mauled to death.
---
I may be ignorant, but Canadian mythology?
---
Honestly what pissed me off about the post in the first place was the "get on it BHVR." Like, um, no, what you said is not fucking law. And if she even needed a nerf, that should come after fixing the goddamn hitboxes and other shit that affects more than one killer/all survivors. I don't want to keep Spirit because I hate survivors, I want to keep her because she's completely find compared to the other issues in the game.
---
i was discriminated against for being a nerd when i was younger
---
I don't want cross-play with PC.
---
The killer gets moved around 75% more when you're wiggling and auras of hooks within 16 meters are hidden for them (which IMO needs to be at least 10 more meters to be viable)
---
they just released the remastered version of the shining (which is what made me think of this idea). They also are releasing a sequel in October, i think now would be a better time than ever to release him as a killer. Also The Shining made 19 million dollars so it is also a multi million dollar story.
---
Ogopogo, skunk ape, and alot of native stories
---
They ironed out his wrinkles.
---
It could be like how it does it with Cod and Fortnite, where if you party with PC players, it matches you with them, and if you don‚Äôt, it won‚Äôt
---
I was just coming her to ask if OP is ok with pc nurse vs console survivor! 
---
I already get flogged I‚Äôm console enough as is, please be gentle with me.
---
I only bought him because I like his look. If a survivor is a skin, I‚Äôm getting the skins I like
---
I WAITED FOR THE SHRINE TO RESET INSTEAD OF BUYING COULROPHOBIA AND I'VE BEEN REGRETTING IT ALL DAY.
---
Hi lost, I'm [Stuff](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/029/180/cover1.jpg)!
---
Is that the wrong article? This is about ps now and cloud gaming
---
Yo it was a joke chill
---
yeah but you HAVE to admit dojng gens and gen rushing ARE the same thing to lots of killers. When they put no pressure and get outplayed in 3 minutes and complain we do gens fast bc there was no gen pressure
---
Buff the weaker killers instead of making red rank just Billy and Nurse by nerfing spirit.  
---
Spirit has counterplay just like Nurse does, it just requires you to be more creative and mind gamey in chase instead of mechanically perfect loops.
---
I would say stop running. Loop him in a circle and try to back track on your scratches and walk away. It‚Äôs hard but if you time it right you can lose the killer.
---
Well, the Nurse addon preview has been both excited and concerned. The addon rework to give you a unique ability to go back to your original blink spot is a neat idea.
---
Moving Plaid Flannel to common should have happened a long time ago.
---
But the issue is that it seems they aren't removing Range addons... Oh dear, why are they not removing Omegablink... this won't end well.
---
You mentioned him once in an edit of a comment and then accuse me of "constantly" avoiding it. 
---
The fact that you think TrueTalent is proof of anything is a worry. Go watch Scott Jund shit on rank 1 swfs with Spirit and make them look like Rank 20s. You can cherry pick YouTube content to look however you want. But go ahead, share the true clips, I'm interested to see them. 
---
And I cant argue with your last comment. Absolutely right on that.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Same! While it‚Äôs not super proactive, it‚Äôs a funny one when it works!
---
Yeah, but I've already accepted them about a year ago, why do I have to accept them again?
---
The Bloodhunt really made some killers play very sweaty. On the killer side i had at least one dc per game and i was only playing adepts + Barbecue/Shadowborn. So it wasn't too much fun to play. 
---
Back to the tunneling:
---
Try to bait attacks/teleports/dashes when you're sure they won't hit.
---
Check if they respect pallets and use that to your advantage.
---
Run close to the object/s you're looping to get the most out of a loop.
---
Try to react to backing as fast as you can.
---
In hopeless situations you can try to 360 as it may help against some players.
---
Mettle of Man is not useful and if you're being tunnelled you'd probably never get a single stack.
---
I know, DBD community is generally toxic af no matter which side you play
---
I mean like let's not forget that Survivors can bring really strong Medkits with Instaheals as well as literally stealing wins wit Keys... She and Nurse are the only ones who can deal with that shit. The moment a killer is strong everyone comes for it. It's depressing. Killer should be the power role, not the bully role. :(
---
Would be your own fault for grabbing the wrong survivor
---
But it's not an objectively bad play. It's effective in many circumstances. Try it right after a rank reset and you'll probably get a 3k. But it's a dick move whether or not it's effective.
---
I would be down
---
Hag is by far the most fun killer go play. Its like trapper but way better
---
ü§ò
---
Social class was always a determining factor in who gets drafted and who manages to evade it. Working class men, because they were working class, were drafted
---
Mettle of Man is trash after the much needed nerf to it.  Especially if you‚Äôre getting tunneled as you aren‚Äôt going to get any protection hits for it.
---
A bug.. a feature I mean dear sir.
---
This beautiful game only contains features.
---
What in my comment wasn't chill?
---
And it's impossible to tell on this sub - the amount of stupid shit people say is off the charts - especially since my original comment was downvoted right before you commented.
---
If BHVR could do this with the option for choosing whether you want to cross play than cool.
---
Yeah the demo could pimp slap the fuck out of legion before they could even get close enough with their little shivs
---
It would be great, shorter times for matches also a bigger player base overall!
---
This. Oh I liiiike
---
This. Ooooh I liiiiiike this.
---
&gt;overgrown
---
Isn't that just the whole huntress?
---
Demogorgon can conserve stacks by using Shred and Plague can conserve stacks by using Corrupt Purge
---
Because youre rank 12. 
---
At about rank 8 bitter murmur and MnA must be enduring and spirit fury. At about rank 6, you must be running tuning guide and grease/bulbs. Use black wards on guide/bulbs.
---
She does, the person who put this render together didn‚Äôt include them for some reason.
---
As I said it might be a bug. But in any case, write a support ticket so the devs know of this too. They might be able to tell you where this comes from.
---
No wonder you hate the map as survivor, you dc when you're on it. Get good please
---
You‚Äôve got yourself a deal!

OK THIS HAPPENED DURING THE DOUBLE EVENT. I WAS PLAYING SURVIVOR AND HAD AN AWESOME GAME RIGHT UNTIL THE END. I GOT CAUGHT AND THE GATES WE'RE POWERED. SOME CRAZY BRAVE SOUL TRIED TO SAVE ME AND SHE TRADED PLACES. 
---
I HAD TO GO BACK FOR HER. SHE WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER WHO STUCK THEIR NECK OUT FOR ME. WELL SOMEHOW WE MANAGED TO SAVE HER! AS WE'RE HEADING TO THE EXIT I NOTICED I WAS LAGGING THEN BAM IT DISCONNECTED ME. THE DICKHEAD KILLER PULLED HIS PLUG AND I GOT ZERO POINTS!!! 
---
BTW TWO PARTY STREAMERS WE'RE BURNED TOO AND I CAPPED NEARLY ALL MY POINTS. ARGHHH!!!!
---
Short version: It wastes a Perk slot.
---
Long version: 25/50/75% more wiggle effect and obscures hooks within 14m radius. So basically nothing.
---
Where did you even find this image? lol
---
An example would be if there was a lever that could de-rail to coaster or shut it off or something of the sort.
---
Being a nerd was your choice of a lifestyle being black or Mexican is not a choice
---
Ok
---
this is fucking sending me im biting my cheeks in the middle of a lecture hall to avoid guffawing like a hyena
---
Because Plague only has one good skin (sea-goat worshipper) so she needs more skins. At least Legion has like 4 good skins that people want.
---
It's been 4 hours and no one has mentioned r/dbdgonewild nor the fact that he's naked SMH
---
I think because I paired it with another cosmetic, I could really see his ass. It was distracting, and not in a good way.
---
It absolutely makes sense to tank a hit with borrowed time.
---
Why wouldn't you? You are already injured, the timer won't go down if he chases you, and if the rescuer has already been on the hook you have plenty of motivation to re-take the aggro,especially with DS
---
Not using the chainsaw? Then it's not him being good  you could play any killer like that lmao
---
I'm not angry at people who genrush, lmao. I'm angry at arrogant idiots
---
Basically this. It's kinda fucked how good Ruin can be in most matches. 
---
I've played enough Survivor and Killer and the time between getting an exhaustion perk or ruin is just awful. Not being able to extend chases with Borrowed Landing just makes me want to die.
---
New fun builds, play with friends.  Take a break.  Besides that the game has one game mode and really only one way to play
---
Playing with friends and using meme builds are the two ways I get alot of fun from the game these days. It means my ranks always pretty low but it's alot of fun.
---
The spirit Kimono skin is cool.
---
You have floaty sleeves. I occasionally just move weirdly to see them boing around lol
---
Considering how much of a unit Michael is I'd say we've moved past Mach scale over to warp factor.
---
Not really they have two or 3 if even that.
---
Mostly it's Susie and maybe some Joey.
---
Never really seen anyone go crazy over Frank or Julie cosmetics it would have been nice to see them get one that people would definitely like
---
I find this comment extremely *accurate*
---
More so the killer side, kinda sad since I‚Äôm also a killer main
---
Sounds like a survivors wet dream.
---
It wouldn't feel like a deadbydaylight game anymore with a new game mechanic like that.
---
I farm green med kits with pharmacy and it happened twice rip
---
PLEASE STOP BULLYING BABY BUBBA!
---
HE'S DOING HIS BEST!
---
Perk: **Boil Over**
---
Your struggling effects on the Killer are increased by 25/50/75 %.
---
If when struggling the killer gets pushed towards a wall,stun him for 3/6/20 seconds
---
Even if they averaged a rank 6 and a rank 10 to a rank 8 killer, there is still a noticeable difference a lot of the time and they will tunnel the rank 10 regardless. There is no solution to your friend not getting tunneled for sucking, except you doing a better job carrying him
---
I've gotten to rank 8 Survivor, ruin is most definitely still a problem on most maps. Even games that lose it quick don't go as good as they would if it wasn't there.
---
Head on
---
Xbox and PlayStation together would be fantastic
---
Dude, I‚Äôm sorry you had a game like this. That really sucks. Sometimes you just get really crappy games. Both playing killer or survivor. Sometimes your teammates can be immature and sometimes the killer can be immature. I‚Äôm a ghost face main, I was playing survivor. The ghost face took me to the hatch and closed it in front of me and tea bagged me for the entire end game collapse and didn‚Äôt hook me. We had 2 dcs and he hooked the other survivor.
---
The entity took me and I thought, ‚Äúnice dude.‚Äù And moved on. I was definitely pissed about it.
---
That clown kinda sucked
---
That killer is shit
---
As a Killer main I will never intentionally tunnel you. DS for one. The only exceptions are if I go back to patrolling gens and the unhooking happens before I get far enough away and I come back and I start tracking scratch marks that lead me to you, well... that‚Äôs just how it is.
---
I will always try to go after the unhooker. Or anyone getting in my way of an injured survivor.
---
I don‚Äôt camp or facecamp. I like to spread the pain around because I know as a survivor myself who sucks at looping and evading killers it ain‚Äôt no fun getting hooked 3 times in a row when the killer refuses to go after anyone else.
---
Also your teammates need to help or safely unhook. Sometimes your teammates are selfish 
---
, sometimes when a killer is camping it‚Äôs hard to do a safe unhook.
---
her skin aint too bad just wish it still had hair cause the headpiece looks fucking stupid floating on top of her head like that
---
Outstanding! Also love the QOL of trapper resetting his traps after picking a survivor up.
---
Actually I would like some original content, cause they have more autonomy with the cosmetics instead of just default costume/bloody costume.
---
But, if I had to choose:
---
* Jason
---
* Candyman
---
* Pinhead
---
* Chucky
---
In no particular order.
---
Yea even if he manages a few chainsaw downs, the gens will go too fast and the chases will be too long
---
No. Don't waste your time.
---
You lost and said gg, not you won hard and said gg. Saying gg when you win is easy, saying it when you lost is hard. I'll only say GG if the loser says it first
---
I was and always have been a Rank 1 Killer pretty much my entire playtime on the game and I never gave opinions on Survivor because I pretty much played one side. That changed when the new rank system came out. I got to Rank 1 Survivor within like 6-7 days with the new ranking system when it was harder to rank up as surivvor (It takes 1 less pip now). Now I'm rank 1 survivor every reset. 
---
I've never had an easier time beating M1 Killers endlessly, even with potato teammates. Spirit and Nurse don't make it easy. Spirit and Nurse make it a challenge. They make it so you do not fuck about in the game and do the actual objective. But at the same time, if you make them make mistakes in chases, you're winning, you're helping your team. They should be doing fucking gens and nothing else. But they do not. A lot of people say shit like "they play to not win, to have fun" and all this BS. Well then my little braindeads. Why do you constantly blame Nurse and Spirit becayse you don't win games? Because you do not fucking try and always DC when you see/hear them. It's pathetic. Survivors have been nerfed and nerfed from patch to fucking patch. And are still THE Power Role. Ugh. Makes my mind melt at the prospect of not having Nurse or Spirit in DBD to keep the SWF in check.
---
Can you figure out his perks? I had 4 in mind.
---
I can use whatever god damn perks I please as killer and survivor and so can you, so put a sock in it when you tell me not to use specific perks! And when you try to report me for fucking playing how I want, I can report you for falsely reporting me, since tunneling, camping, etc. don‚Äôt fall under viable reports! I can also report you for being a dick through messages or disconnecting (intentionally I mean, I won‚Äôt report if it‚Äôs obvious you use a potato for a router)!
---
wait, sprint burst is meta?
---
&gt; Moris aren't bad. I see your a toxic survivor main.
---
I play around 70/30 for Killer/Survivor, more so killer as it can be more fun. I hate using ebony's and ivory's because it ends the game much faster than normal gameplay, I don't want to get mori'd by ebony or ivory moris, so why would I use them?
---
If I was a toxic survivor main, I'd use instas and keys. I don't even use either. I don't like keys, moris and insta heals, because they are unfair and unbalanced, just as bad as prayer beads and omega blink nurse.
---
Change roles, take a break. I took a break for like a month, came back then the game was fun for another 300 hours. You need regular breaks
---
I feel like there needs to be a r/okbuddyretard but for DBD, this is too funny
---
True dat!  Take my updoot good sir or madam!
---
People complain about omegablink too much imo
---
Honestly I am not a fan of any of the new cosmetics, except Clown
---
Thank you very much üòä
---
I think this isn't even a scene
---
I'M NOT ANGRY, I JUST WANT TO USE ALLCAPS!!!
---
If you can remember map placement like a SWF group, she can make it somewhat easier with chases.
---
I switch up between survivor and killer. I also try new characters every couple weeks (I‚Äôve only been playing about a month and half)
---
I also have a low rank killer account where I just goof around and chase survivors but never kill them.
---
Because I'm weak and not capable for warfare and don't want to be drafted? The army is a perfect place to be attacked.
---
P.S.: I'm eventually fine, but yet again only because my family had some money back then. Other weak and uncapable for warfare guys were certainly less lucky.
---
BAD KILLER DON'T YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO FOLLOW MY 56,433 DIFFERENT RULES AND LET ME WIN EVERY GAME OTHERWISE YOU'RE A SHITHEAD BABY KILLER NOOB TUNNELING CAMPER, I WORKED ON A GEN FOR 3 SECONDS THEREFOR I AM ENTITLED TO WALK RIGHT OUT THE EXIT GATE AND DON'T YOU DARE STOP ME
---
SARCASM ASIDE IF YOU GET """TUNNELED""" AS A SURVIVOR THAT'S JUST THE KILLER PLAYING EFFICIENTLY. NO, IT'S NOT FUN TO BE ON THE END OF BUT GUESS WHAT, IT'S MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE KILLER TO KILL SOMEONE THAN TO SPREAD HIS HOOKS OUT.
---
well you can dodge it and basically he charges at survivors the shred ability has about the same hit boxes as billy and both the chainsaw and the shred ability can get hits through pallets most other killers cant basically shred is the hillbillys chainsaw with faster charge time for a tradeoff of not one shotting survivors the shred takes 0.65 seconds to charge and in the middle of using the pounce he moves at 400 percent movement speed
---
Was talking about this with my friend last night. Enduring was awesome to help with both stuns and DS.
---
\^\^
---
I just want the ability to transfer progress in any game on console to any game on PC ;-; I've put to much time into DBD, For Honor, and Siege!
---
I usually start the search as a killer and watch about 12-17 mins of Netflix/VRV until it grabs a lobby...
---
The life of a killer is a patient one
---
**Boil Over**
---
You are a battler and do everything to escape a foes' grasp.
---
When picked up by the Killer you boil over and immediately *explode*.
---
You, The Killer, and any Survivors within 4/8/12 meters are all afflicted with the *Dead* status effect. You cannot recover from *Dead*.
---
SURVIVORS ARE HERE TO SURVIVE DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT INSTA-HEAL IF YOU WANT TO PLAY HOWEVER YOU WANT AND NOT EXPECT THE SAME BACK
---
Thailand (I think) speaks Chinese, and in Chinese 555 is a slang way of laughing because the number sounds like laughing.
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
*If when struggling, the killer gets pushed into a wall, stun him for 3/6/**fucking kill him** seconds*
---
Fuck it lets just go 5 blink
---
I have a different experience, CGI monsters are often used as guilt-free cannon fodder to be shredded through by baddass main characters. Although your logic is consistent with the Terminator movies.
---
People are annoyed with her really good play yet she has a super high floor.  It‚Äôs pretty hard to be bad at spirit
---
*EDIT INTENSIFIES*
---
It's crazy to see the backlash for the matchmaking now that the tables have turned.
---
&gt;"My lower ranked friends hate going against Red ranked killers when I queue with them. It's not fair and it makes the game too hard for them"
---
Meanwhile, pre-matchmaking fix I doubt these people gave a fuck about the killers they were seal clubbing.
---
I need source
---
Both Scenarios. Not camp, but proxy camp. I just do not leave those 3 gens. I let survivors to unhook each other, but trying to hook the unhooker.  I also ignore survivors that trying to lure me out of my triangle.
---
And only if gens are extremely close to other. In other cases i just hook and go to other gens.
---
Oof thoes poor poor controller players are going to get demolished by the killers. Keyboard and mouse are objectively more accurate and have faster reaction times. They wont stand a chance. Maybe if BHVR add it where you can have games where there are only controller players?
---
I don't know exactly how matchmaking worked before 3.2 but it seemed like it was something of an average.  3.2 broke matchmaking and it needed to be fixed but all they did was swing from one extreme to the other.  I had a bunch of friends decide to try DBD after it was put on Xbox Game Pass earlier this summer and they're still fairly new to the game so they're not great and the combination of having to wait forever for games looking to match with my red rank and then just getting curbstomped in the games has pushed them back to what they were playing before giving DBD a try.  We were playing DBD 3-4 nights a week for a couple months before this change.  We've played once since the change because it was just that bad of an experience.
---
I'm sorry, she looks like a melting candle. I don't like hers very much

**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; i love this so much it pains me to remove it but it's against the rules!
---
/s might've saved you, but its hard to tell knowing reddit
---
What you expect? I sit in a corner and do nothing?
---
They're meant to be used after having a bad game.
---
not true, it gives the killer a speed boost when they strafe to whatever side the struggle is headed in
---
first off, it doesnt matter that its a choice or not, i was just proving you wrong that white men don't know discrimination, and second, even if its a choice, it's a choice based on a very strong preference and going against it would have made me unhappy. does that sound similar to another hot topic in social justice? transexuality maybe? oh yeah. a choice based on strong feelings.
---
Its in Beta phase and its not official if it will become a full feature. Theyre most likely test before the ps5 comes out
---
I know about scratch marks and I don't Tbag at all 
---
I can loop just fine. Could loop the killer for half the game. Just can't break sight long enough to sneak away or if I do its brief cause they eventually find me
---
Your comment is quite ironic.
---
[deleted]
---
well i think they are better in different situations in some situations the hillbillys longer charge time could potencially screw him over sometimes if you mess it up
---
Made it to rank 4 with billy on xbox btw, kid

I‚Äôve been seeing the word ‚Äúdoot‚Äù a lot since yesterday. Is this some reddit thing for October I‚Äôm unaware of?

Oh and I like wasting my money on looking neat for others.
---
No one:
---
Frank pisses off the demogorgon
---
Joey:Here we go again...
---
Did they specifically say they weren't changing omegablink? I thought they were reworking a number of things and only shared some of the changes.
---
This is extremely surface level. Not only is the hitbox for Shred tighter, you cannot maneuver it. And, again, the simple fact that the Chainsaw is instadown and can cross the map in a matter of seconds renders this entire argument you're presenting moot. Huntress can hit over pallet tosses and that attack has range as well so I guess it's the same, amirite?
---
&gt; he moves at 400 percent movement speed
---
Considering the severe lack of range, who cares? lmao
---
dude come on
---
Dwight should be thicker
---
Why not just go for the average rank in SWF? If I‚Äôm red rank, my friend is green rank, go for purple rank.
---
Obviously, facing baby killers was boring. But facing god tier killers while playing with my friends is just as frustrating. They‚Äôre potatoes and we usually like to play for fun, but there‚Äôs nothing fun about getting bullied every single game because my friends suck yet I‚Äôm red rank. 
---
I am well aware that matchmaking was broken for a bit. But this ‚Äúsolution‚Äù is just as unfun, except now it‚Äôs unfun for the other side. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôll just stay on Killer while my friends play SWF so they can actually enjoy games together instead of constantly getting wrecked by Spirits, Billys and Nurses. Please just go back to how it was before, I always thought it was the average (before matchmaking broke) and that was by far a better experience. Still get decent killers, and my friends wouldn‚Äôt get absolutely rocked. I can‚Äôt be the only one with this issue lol
---
I mean Spitter got added with this event too
---
SURVEILLANCE IS PRETTY GOOD FOR GEN BUILDS AT LEAST, IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERKS TO RUN ON DEMO RIGHT NOW WITH TREMORS/RUIN/BBQ OR SURGE
---
Ye I totally get that, didn't think much of it at first but oh well
---
They're more than likely boosted to high ranks because they are SWF, free wins Vs M1 Killers man and they fall over Vs actually good Killers where they need to play differently.
---
She has tons of counterplay with Pallets and Windows you just have to make her think you're doing something different to mindgame her around it. It's like with Nurse when you break LoS, she'll have an idea where you're going but you make yourself unpredictable to the best of your capabilities. There is counterplay. To say there's none is completely ridiculous. 
---
Removing what you are from Spirit makes her no longer the power role, leaving only Nurse, is that a world we want? One killer at rank 1 every game?
---
Please give us a buff please
---
If you have to fall back on "they're better for different situations" then your original thesis is wrong

&gt; While it's not announcing the news explicitly, the PS4's cross-play efforts have officially moved out of the beta stage, meaning that the console can support cross-play on any titles that studios provide the functionality for. This month's Modern Warfare may be the first major title to take advantage of it at launch, and likely won't be the last
---
Battlepass shit can die in a fire.
---
Rats
---
Well, sounds like you have my survivor curse where no fucking matter what you do, the survivor finds you early game and always catches you.
---
First buff mom, then we can talk about other perks, at least kate has 2 other nice perks, while ash not a single one. But i agree boil over has potential to be ok perk If they buffed it.
---
Scooby doo dlc pls
---
Nah devour hope
---
It required a lot of time to get the vials but it was fun, unless you were survivor.. but hopefully the new kankerous gens will be better

Amazing idea.

are you insane

I guess I'll be Demogorgon.

What? How is wanting to play with my friends toxic? 
---
When I played with my friends we always got like purple rank killers, which is perfectly fine. Never felt unfair in any way, just a good game. Meanwhile now, I‚Äôm playing with potatoes for friends, and I myself have acknowledged many times that I‚Äôm really not even that great a survivor so me being in red ranks already is frustrating and unless I spend time purposely de piping, the only time I genuinely enjoy survivor is during rank reset. 
---
Shit I even acknowledged in my original comment that matchmaking was fucking broken, boring and unfun. Bullying a baby killer was ridiculous. What part of anything I said is toxic?
---
david is jane's object of obsession
---
I agree. Although I still think they could have made the old system better
---
Idk who these are but they seems more like a good match for Legion as opposed to Trapper.
---
I lowkey want an Until Dawn Psycho cosmetic for Trapper.

*sigh*

I AM SICK AND TIRED OF MY TEAMMATES GETTING LOADED INTO A MATCH WITHOUT ME. HALF OF MY BLOOD HUNT CONSISTED OF THIS AND IT WAS REALLY ANNOYING BUT WHAT ELSE AM I GOING TO PLAY? BORDERLANDS? HARD PASS
---
thats what i thought
---
&gt;177013
---
I see you saved the best for last
---
Shit happens in video games *shrug* similar things have happened to me before
---
That is accurate,  I mentally give up as soon as I know its her.
---
Did it to me on console and my account was fine
---
I do it with regular breaks and dodging known Spirit mains whenever possible.
---
Having a goal to work towards can also help.
---
In one of my games my 3 teammates all had adrenaline and healed off the last gen. I felt bad for the killer lol
---
Getting gen rushed by SFW with commodious toolboxes isn't going to make me want to be handicapped.
---
Killers aren't just survivor punching bags you know, toxic survivor main.
---
I can't tell if this is the best thing I've ever seen or the worst
---
I mean you can always just vote with you wallet no need to bash something others might enjoy not to mention the Battle pass aspect of  The Archives was only a small portion of what it brings to the table I think people or more hyped for that juicy lore that the devs have been teasing through the games various updates and events.
---
&gt;She has tons of counterplay with Pallets and Windows you just have to make her think you're doing something different to mindgame her around it.
---
This is what I was talking about before: It's day one thinking and it doesn't work in actual matches. Spirit doesn't have to do anything once you drop a pallet and you then have to show your hand. Let's play it out:
---
**Scenario 1:**
---
You drop the pallet. 
---
Spirit stands and looks at you. 
---
You think she's phasing so start to move around the loop/slow vault the pallet. 
---
Spirit is not phasing, hits you as you come around the loop or as you come across the pallet. 
---
**Scenario 2:**
---
You drop the pallet.
---
You carry on looping the pallet.
---
Spirit activate phase, bumps into you with collision and hits you. 
---
**Scenario 3:**
---
You drop the pallet
---
Spirit stands and looks at you.
---
You do nothing.
---
Spirit activates phase and comes over and hits you.
---
**Scenario 4:**
---
You walk away from the pallet. 
---
Spirit doesn't phase and just chases you no that you're not close to the structure. 
---
**Scenario 5:**
---
You run away from the pallet. 
---
Spirit phases to your scratch marks and footstep sounds and hits you now that you're not close to a structure. 
---
\------------------------------
---
In every situation, the Spirit just has to stand still to gain all the information they need to beat you at the tile. Survivor has no counter-play to it because they have no information as to what is actually happening. And, bear in mind, my suggested nerfs wouldn't even change this as I didn't say they would add an animation to her regular phase (although I think they should).
---
Spirit's most powerful mindgame is standing still and doing nothing and it's very poor game design. If you can't see that I think you're very biased.
---
but you can't head on with three crows
---
OMG do you have the template?
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt I end on a classic?
---
These addon reworks won't be enough to bring the nurse to an acceptable level of strength. She needs a rework to her base kit. Sure this is a nice bandaid fix for her most op stuff, but I really hope this isn't where they plan to leave the nurse for another year.
---
THIS IS THE SONG THAT NEVER ENDS
---
YES, IT GOES ON AND ON, MY FRIENDS
---
I'm already demogorgon
---
+2 for excellent use of another amazing dwight.
---
I TOTALLY FEEL YOU, A KILLER MESSAGED MY TEAM AND TOLD US TO POP STREAMERS  TO FARM AND WHEN THE GAME LOADED IN HE DISCONNECTED IMMEDIATELY AND SENT AL OF US A MESSAGE SAYING THAT THE ENTITY WAS PLEASED.
---
&gt; DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT INSTA-HEAL IF YOU WANT TO PLAY HOWEVER YOU WANT AND NOT EXPECT THE SAME BACK
---
IT'S LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE FOR ME. I TEND TO FLOW THE ~SURVIVOR RULES~ AND PLAY TO MAXIMIZE MY HOOKS AND VERY DELIBERATELY DON'T TUNNEL OR CAMP, DON'T USE NOED, DON'T BRING MORIS, DON'T BRING IN REALLY STRONG ADD-ONS. IF I TUNNEL THE FUCK OUT OF SOMEONE IT'S BECAUSE THEY USED AN INSTAHEAL AND CHANGED MY RULES. I PLAY ACCORDING TO HOW SURVIVORS PLAY.
---
Taking words out of context. I do not camp hooks, i protect 3 gens. And if you got caught in that area, then its your problem.
---
BT and DS won't work, because im not Tunneling unhooked. Im tunneling only those who had audacity to bait me into their DS by going into lockers or repairing gens right under my nose.
---
Who oppresses women for being women? Who oppresses men for being men?

BHVR just needs to fix those damn pies already
---
I agree. I've grinded too much on PS4 to just start fresh when I get a better PC next month.
---
What am I supposed to do? Stay injured so she can become an insta saw hillbilly for the rest of the game? I don't find that difficult to dodge her vomit, especially if the commits too much to it
---
Oh.
---
OKAY THAT'S KIND OF DANK LMAO
---
Ahh yes the microphone to help with hearing. I know of such a thing!
---
Seriously though, she needs more cosmetics like "Night Out," I don't rock any other head than that one because she doesn't look like street trash
---
Depends on the context, but usually the answer for both questions is "society".
---
IT WAS VERY DANK
---
I like Iridecsent button and Frank's Mixtape

---
Maybe he has a chain saw that is an instant downed, but when he activates it he is really slow due to his weight and his chainsaw?
---
And for a chainsaw hand it could be "Mr Wiggly, Ash's trusty sidekick...
---
For his commercials."
---
not everyone is great at the game and for those of us like that, we need perks that actually do things
---
Oh sorry, forgot about that
---
The point is that a good swf knows to not let you set up your web in the first place and will actively sabotage it. It's particularly an issue if they have someone with OoO, since they can follow you around thanks to Hag's small TR and trigger your traps, forcing you to chase them.
---
Survivor was fill the vial then suicide.
---
Killer required 2 event hooks per 1/3rd which was hell if you weren't running Agitation and Iron Grasp
---
I'm pretty sure it's only a problem on pc. It happened to me when I first started playing during a free weekend.
---
What?
---
Decently close to being balanced, better than behavior could do anyway
---
Buy Ash now
---
but in any movie he looks like heavy form tf2
---
TOO BAD THERE ARE NO DEDICATED SERVERS
---
oh whoops
---
Hey man I play on console too, but let's not disrespect PC players, ok?
---
If every killer brought omega blink nurse I would laugh, cause most nurses are pretty garbage. And the really good ones don't run that setup because it's too boring for them otherwise, so I don't really get your point.
---
I take object of obsession and bring a flashlight every game, if I'm not getting tunnelled I'm doing something wrong LOL.
---
Okay
---
I mean. Rightfully so. I main Nurse and that shit smells broken.
---
Yeah everyone's saying this ones the best, but I think the clowns better
---
I would love to see how devs could make a blight skin for jane
---
Heavy Panting isn't even a base range add on too. So if Ataxic respiration wasn't touched, Omegablink probably got buffed a bit.
---
it's part of the game?
---
how about don't be toxic and play the game. if you die you die. that's that. Stop calling killers names because you died or because you think their strategy was nooby or 'cheap' the fact is they still got you.
---
Every time I get hooked first I accept my fate. If I die I die.  if the killer camps me then so be it. Im not going to yell at him especially if the tactic works and he kills the rest of my team and Im not going to blame my team if they ignore me either to get all the gens.
---
A game is a game, move on to the next. Toxic attitudes ruin these games.
---
The Smiley's are a gang  of sick individuals employed by Mr Lionel starkweather to kill Manhunts main protagonist James Earl Cash form the game series manhunt. The Smiley's are mental patients that broke free and killed all the guards and they hunt participants in a snuff film that Cash is trying to survive among other groups. That's basically who the Smiley's are without spoilers
---
Hopefully if they do this they will only do it with Xbox and not PC or give us a choice we can opt out on cause ik I would not want to play against pc players
---
As a regular head on user I hated old enduring
---
How?
---
Other people have said this, but I‚Äôll say it myself;
---
I am a die hard Evil Dead fan (especially Ash vs Evil Dead). He‚Äôs the only survivor I play and I love this outfit in particular.
---
I have never seen Stranger Things- it looks good, but I‚Äôve never seen it; I didn‚Äôt like the survivor perks that much, so I wasn‚Äôt interested in playing the two new survivors. The Demogorgon is cool, sure, and I have played as it- but I‚Äôm still going to play as Myers, Ghostface and Freddy, and likely never really play Demogorgon. I do like the map very much, but there are parts to it that really annoy me.
---
I don't understand what's going on with Tapp's arm in that icon
---
Can't tell you how many times this happens. Killers reaches through windows and over pallets is broken af. Lol
---
&gt; *So my friends just went back to playing what they played before giving DBD a try.*
---
People are going to point out that if your friends are willing to play without you in other games, then there was no reason they couldn't just play DBD without you and get matched against people appropriate to their level. If they enjoyed the game then they'd be into Green soon enough, if not Purple.
---
The devs can't balance the game around goodwill. Just because you may have played with kid gloves against the low rank killers doesn't mean that other people weren't mercilessly punishing them and driving them from the game.
---
By the same standard, just because a killer decides to goof off against clearly outclassed survivors doesn't mean that that there aren't a horde of killers who'll end the game in 5 minutes or less.
---
Qaud brand new part literally means you can instantly do a fucking gen, normally it's fine but tryharding the shit out of the gens using op add-ons is just gen rushing.
---
I thought corrupt purge consumed stacks? I know that vile purge doesn't
---
Mkay... Buy those cosmetics that you do like. Or do not buy at all, cause you are not forced.
---
If you're good enough, you still assert dominance by eating DS because they're down two with 5 gens left still.
---
No mither, self care, second wind, inner strength
---
There's a shit ton of lore coming, as well as things such as challenges that are better than daily rituals. Who gives a fuck about optional cosmetics? Nothing will be pay to win.
---
We will make it. Quick and Quiet. Ace in the hole. Bond
---
I feel the chainsaw could be able to break open areas maybe instead of instadowns and it's actually like a regular m1 also but could maybe do others effects like disgust or a infection that slows generator progress a bit or healing?
---
Face camping is dumb as a killer and ruins the game for someone. Obviously people are going to be mad if you do it. People shouldn't call others names and such but there's really no reason to do that as a killer unless you want to spite someone.
---
Well from what I noticed is that Steam gives you an initial timer that states how long it will take you to download the patch. Once that's done, Steam will give you an updated timer on how long it will take to install the recently downloaded patch.
---
question: why do you have sprint burst with lithe you do realize that sprint burst cancels out lithe?
---
PLEASE FIX THIS DISCONNECTING BUG,, THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE WITH IT LIKE THIS
---
What are you going on about, trapping hooks, literally you gave no insight to how it works. Just when stepped on. But you are sabotaging a hook like wtf. Please explain it more.
---
Increased range effectively increases her charge speed. 
---
There was no downside to the add-on since "blink accuracy" was removed with Pig IIRC. (If memory serves me they changed the mechanics behind how her blink works with that patch). 
---
She already applies insane map pressure and has insane chase potential. Having a blink that has iirc 50% increased range is gonna open up avenues for her to end chases before Surviviors even have an opportunity to escape her. 
---
Honestly I like what they did with Jenner's last breath, and I'm hoping they do the same (add some fun features) to her other purple add-ons.
---
I miss this game so much...
---
Not saying give up cause she‚Äôs still loopable but it takes way less skill and brainpower for the spirit to mind game loops than most killers
---
Yes. I just seen it also I hope it happens
---
Well, it would be the greatest licensed DLC ever made for dbd when it happens. So I'd say it's understandable.
---
I'm sure you'll get your upvotes, You'll be fine.
---
&gt; *New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.*
---
On the plus side, at least that means the game is still getting new players? Probably not their best introduction to the game though...
---
She's just unfun as a survivor because there is little you can do to outplay her. Even the nurse, who is arguably a lot stronger than the spirit, isn't as unfun to play against because there are ways that you can outplay her. I personally think the biggest reason why the spirit is so unfun to play against is that, as a survivor in a chase, whenever the spirit is phasing you have no idea whether she is using her ability or not making the mindgames very one sided in favour of the spirit. For instance, look at all the other killers. All of them make it known to the survivor in one way or another when they are using their ability. This gives the survivors room to react and outplay the killer. If the devs added some sort of indication to the spirit that lets the survivors know when she is phasing (even if the survivor is within the terror radius), that would make her a lot more bearable to play against.
---
The devs also need to take a look at the spirits most powerful addons and nerf them.
---
It could be good if it‚Äôs like red dead one
---
No offense, but try harder. I know it sounds like I‚Äôm being insulting, but I‚Äôm serious, the best you can do vs a group is sweat your ass off.
---
Not sure how else to explain it.
---
Pig is also less common than Hag...
---
They probably updated something in their EULA meaning we have to reagree to it, popped up for me too.
---
Yeah i decided to go for Knockout instead.
---
lifes greatest truth always coming in with the hard facts
---
What about Freddy?
---
It is
---
Ok, so in simple terms. Trapper go up to hook, Trapper hold action to make scrap from hook and make trap from scrap, hook becomes unusable and scrap goes to make deadlier but fragile trap, deadly trap is easily destroyed, but extremely dangerous to do so.
---
I really thought we‚Äôd get one for Kate for some reason
---
true but Id rather spend my time having fun.  So I;ll do my best to end the match as soon as possible.
---
I would assume because you're searching during the middle of a week day. Most people will have jobs or school.
---
this happens all the time in my games, im surprised everyone here is so surprised
---
I love Manhunt, so this would be very cool. 
---
Hell, the Pig final boss could make a great killer too.
---
or maybe the killer shouldn't suck at that point, a rank 8 killer shouldn't be bad. I mean I understand the extreme of having 3 rank 1s and 1 rank 20 facing a rank 15 Trapper with Unnerving 1, but that wouldn't happen if it's weighed toward higher ranks, the killer would still be red rank or at the very least purple rank if it takes a while to find a match
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dcckrp/i_cant_get_into_a_game_as_a_killer/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Time to update the video, eh?
---
Interesting that the Heavy Panting change removes a way to extend the Chain Blink window without costing you a Blink in the process - I would have been tempted to take it with new-Jenner for Hag-level "am-I-teleporting-or-not" mindgames.
---
Did they really add more omegablink nurse addons? oh well
---
just buy headphones and dont play with music

Okay, when I go shopping I dont like over 70% of the shop, theres basic clothes I like, like the casual plain top or jumper but for me to proper like it, its gotta bang. Just thought I should tell you just in case anyone on this plant could give the slightest fuck about my opinion on cosmetics. Whether its real life or pixels :)
---
Okay, so none of that is *broken* though. What you described, if the blink accuracy part is accurate (which I don't think it is), is simply strong 
---
&gt; Having a blink that has iirc 50% increased range is gonna open up avenues for her to end chases before Surviviors even have an opportunity to escape her. 
---
There is no functional difference between a survivors ability to escape her when she has omega and when she doesn't. 
---
In the scenario where you have no add-ons and begin a chase, they can't get any meaningful distance away anyway
---
Honestly Piggsy gives me nightmares and scared me when I fought him so seeing his dong and pig mask in-game would probably make me leave if I played survivor and I'm currently trying to beat the game in hard mode and I'm dreading it
---
You raise me uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup‚ô™
---
I accepted it and it was fine, back in 2016 It used to lock me out of the game, happened 3 times.
---
So you don't understand English, got it.
---
Nah, he dies in one of the final episodes of season 2.
---
*rosa de guadalupe noises intensifies*
---
Guys WTF, it's literally post about stupid "survs vs killers" war and you are now doing it.
---
I play creatively. I imagine a build for a Killer or a Survivor that matches unique cosmetics with underused perks, and then I play it out to see what strategy needs to develop. It's pretty fun because the challenge lies in new discoveries and "stories"
---
Good work looks great
---
Any tips on what? What are we supposed to suggest
---
You expect people on the internet to read beyond the headline?
---
Uhhh what?  White people were not targeted during the Holocaust.  There certainly were white people killed in it, politics prisoners, gay people, but they weren‚Äôt targeted due to them being white.  The Holocaust was basically started due to a an almost proto-white nationalism.
---
The only genocide committed against white people was in Haiti.
---
He was definitely intense...but it's doable! Good luck :) 
---
His squealing and grunting pig noises instead of a heartbeat would give me palpitations üòÇ
---
Im Totem
---
That's any community though to be fair.
---
&gt;There is no functional difference between a survivors ability to escape her when she has omega and when she doesn't. 
---
Yes there is. She can only blink a certain distance. Juking her becomes easier the further she is since she has to charge longer and that gives you more time to find a safe spot. With Omega she can circumvent that
---
i KNOW ive heard this music before, i just have no idea where. ive seen the goosebumps show maybe like twice in my life and it was easily 10-15 years ago. wtf.
---
Is it irrational to think that people who said the picture makes no sense, in fact didn't get the joke?
---
Dont know the 2 at the Top, but I would probably put Noob3 and John in there
---
wheres cows?
---
It is a real thing i once had 4 gens done at the same time in the first 3 minutes
---
Or even better, don t tunell and camp. Here i solved your problem. Do you think i like having ds on every build i take. Answer is no, i would rather have dark sense or some other mediocore perk, but in reality killers give me no choice. I wish ds got a buff of 10 seconds stun or survivors have built in ds, just so killers can learn how to win games without tunneling or camping.
---
It's wildly inconsistent and that's annoying for both parties. I wonder if having honing stone be base kit would make it any better or if it would be OP. It really sucks because I understand why survivors can free themselves: think about how awful it would be for you to be unable to get out on your own and be stuck until someone came to get you or the killer picks you up.
---
A good tip too is you can try and walk away from a gen whenever he hooks someone. As someone who plays a lot of Freddy, I usually tp to a gen after a hook, and if I don't see scratch marks I usually don't spend my time looking for anyone since 90% of the time people sprint away when they see me teleporting. It can definitely help you stay hidden. Also just avoid dream snares and try to memorize pallet locations when you're awake to avoid using dream pallets during a Chase
---
Kind of off topic but does anyone know why Freddy and leatherface aren‚Äôt on switch (don‚Äôt really want to play with them but I do want to get barbecue from leatherface)
---
That's... A really good question.  
---
I mean, it makes sense for Legion, since they are different people that sound different when you change skins. But even then all four characters could just be available from the start.  
---
As for other killers...  
---
I guess because some moris let you see the killer too??  
---
I don't know, you just broke my brain with this.
---
**fuck I meant killer**
---
I would of used Claude from FE3H but I guess only a few would get it
---
That‚Äôs not what you said. You said Everyone got offended by the Blendette meme so I made this. You can‚Äôt just change your words around
---
"Planking" you and bodyblocking is fair game. There is no BM there.
---
I have only watched like two if their videos so I decided it would not be fair to rank them.
---
It would depend on how "exceptional" the 20-16 matchmaking is being handled - it *could* be shoving them into the first available space, rather than waiting to see if it can find enough of them for a full game.
---
Still, even if that IS the reason I would still feel bad that it's punishing *you* by matching you with people who may well have no idea how to play, and that it's punishing *them* by throwing them against a killer they can't realistically hope to enjoy playing against (unless the killer is observant and forgiving).
---
But it's better if you play the event since you can get the skins playing and without having to pay.
---
ok
---
This is where your argument makes no sense. SURVIVOR MAIN, ALMOST NO KILLER EXPERIENCE. Where does that matter? In fact that may better than even 50/50 and just now touching spirit. You know exactly how survivors play, which is exactly what you need to know as spirit. As a red rank survivor I can survive Spirit without hatch 50% of the time. Adapt, you can't play against her like other killers. And she is one of the only killers that enforces some of the most underrated non meta perks. (So not DS, Borrowed, Adrenaline, and Dead Hard/BL.) And makes perks like Fixated, Calm Spirit, Iron Will, and Distortion work.
---
Needing to play 2 specific killers to deal with a full red rank SWF is also bad design, and it is objectively worse because perks that counter Spirit and Nurse (Quick and Quiet, Iron Will and Dead Hard) are great against all Killers, so I do not know what you're talking about.
---
&gt; Hmm but t-bagging is done specifically to taunt.
---
As is hitting people on the hook.
---
ever heard of ghost ?
---
Read my comment slowly pal, I‚Äôm cool with body blocking and planks, but teabagging to be toxic is a major dick move :/
---
Windows of Opportunity is very underrated. 
---
Run an exhaustion perk to help in chases.
---
Decisive Strike is always good.
---
Some form of self healing or stealth perk (Urban Evasion or Fixated). I personally like fixated more due to seeing your scratches. Helps mind game.
---
Well this is KYF, so just get an ebony lol
---
If you think uncloaking and cloaking is a bonus then you don't really play much of wraith at the higher ranks.  Being cloaked is only good for securing the first hit, rushing ahead to body block and activating the majority of your good add ons.

My user flair is literally ‚Äúbloody ghost face‚Äù, and I am close to getting him fully bloody. Of course I have.

Doctor was next for a rework (I think?), and then Legion. Hopefully after them we can get a Billy addon change/rework (HARD nerf/destroy 2x Engravings pls).
---
i wanted to change the title but i dont think i can
---
First of all, according to official dev data the majority of players on PC at rank red ranks are solo survivors. 4 man SWF are the rarest, with 3 and 2 man's following them.
---
So your argument of "you need to play nurse and spirit to counter swf" is invalid because the vast majority of survivors are high ranks are solo players, which you could easily 4k even with fucking wraith.
---
Continue practice your looping.  The better you get at it the more criminally unfun you can make the experience of tunneling you.  
---
Run D Strike every game to punish trash killers that do this to you.  Whenever possible save it for what would be the final unhook.  The deeper you get in the game with D Strike available the better off you are.
---
I've been running Quick &amp; Quiet with Head On and the amount of times I've just immediately lost them by breaking line of sight and fast vaulting the locker is insane.  When they do realize you're in there you still got Head On to stun them and get you to the next safe area.  Quick &amp; Quiet is really good against bad killers that tunnel off hooks because they're most likely to fall for the locker juke anyways.  
---
Iron Will is also a very good perk against tunnelers.  Once they lose line of sight it's gg.
---
There's also the fact that most trappers have to go and hunt down their traps to begin with before they can place them.
---
Eat bacon sandwiches between kills. Know that you will beat him, it's just a matter of when :)
---
So every single loop allows you to see the Killer at the pallet? You're talking about cases that are survivors sided with every other killer, you know this right? Jungle Gym, T and L walls, you can break LoS and mind game. Yet just because she can mind game at Pallets that allow you to continuously see the Killer it's bad? And you have more than enough time to leave to find a jungle gym or T and L wall while she is trying to figure you out before phasing, none of this is an issue at all.
---
How are they toxic? Genuine question
---
I find this subreddit very strange how they try to make a correlation between assholes and the role they play within a video game. Some people really do believe that there is not a single asshole killer player... it's really odd.
---
what exactly did you expect, making this thread, which is actually pretty clearly biased towards one side?
---
Or don‚Äôt tunnel
---
well yea thats how I feel half the time I get flashlighted
---
That's because they decided to disable RBT in the endgame. Because it's not bad enough that survivors can just yeet through a hatch with them on, but 'time limit' means 'let's just remove this killers entire end game'.
---
A little odd to call people "fucking animals" for teabagging in a video game... Don't get me wrong, I understand it's very frustrating, but that's a bit dramatic, no?
---
I thought that too, Open Handed would be a lot better if it would also reduce the killers aura reading for things like Sole Survivor or Boil Over
---
Apparently tool boxes and a brand new part is op üò≥ and apparently no killer perks or add ons are as op as a toolbox
---
Can't when people are on console are behind PC players.

---
They went for more ‚Äúgross‚Äù than ‚Äúscary‚Äù with her for some reason. I REALLY wish they‚Äôd done at least one of these new skins like the Wraith‚Äôs last year. Far and away the best skin in the game IMO, he looks *incredible*.

You can't turn the game music off, ROFL.
---
On the SPIRIT. :D
---
So basically it's okay for the killer to DC and deny the escape to all the survs but it's NOT okay for a surv to DC to give another one the hatch... even if hes slugged/dead.
---
Double standards here.
---
Yeah those are OP together Jesus talk about a crutch build smh
---
Agreed and it could be very well because they do the things that would make them a asshole and they do not wanna admit it so they say a killer can do no wrong
---
I mean... it's all there. Its all good anyway. We can agree to disagree on a couple of points. But thanks for having a civil discussion!

I would rather let her injure me with her vomit rather than stay injured the whole game.

I'm all for it, I mean, sure there will be a lot of nurses, but I see alot of nurses on console too. They are there, and at the high ranks they are good. So I don't think it will be too different.
---
I‚Äôm still gonna use Insta heals and Insta downs
---
So you probably shouldn't be so stoked to be doing well and hype it up.
---
And because I know you're gonna ask for proof regarding the claim i made about swf rarely being played in high ranks here it is

see you all in therapy
---
&gt; *I don't know why they felt the fix was to just go from one extreme to the other.*
---
As I suggested elsewhere, it's very likely down to whatever stats they were seeing internally - maybe they were losing too many new killers? Logically they need 1 new killer for every 4 new survivors, and while you can hide a new survivor in a group of experienced ones, you can't really do anything for a new killer.
---
That's just a guess though.
---
&gt; *And there's the new extreme that this "fix" has swung to.*
---
Slightly overlooking the fact that a killer-dominated trial is almost certainly going to result in a depip. Could the same be said of a survivor-dominated trial?
---
Nope and if you miss the check it's a dead perk slot.
---
I am convinced you are the single dumbest person I have ever interacted with on here. Enjoy your day friend.
---
Head On rework: only Jane and Jeff can use it. Everyone else just bounces off the killer‚Äôs body (unless it‚Äôs Legion or Hag)
---
BBQ, Ruin or Pop, Whispers, and Predator or Stridor to help with tracking during spirit walk. Focus on power activation speed and recharge rate. If it‚Äôs pallets that are your issue, give‚Äôm the old one two and run Enduring and Spirit fury.
---
Base nurse is strong, but not broken. The range addons are the issue.
---
&gt;Survivors can't really get outside of a regular blink range after being hit anyway 
---
Uh, yes they can. If the nurse doesn't have range addons.
---
No0b3 should be much lower imo
---
I joined last week!
---
Iron Will. Iron Will literally hard counters good spirits, because they rely on sound rather than foot steps. If you really wanna complain about her whole power, use Fixated or Urban Evasion with that. Spirit does take skill because you have to be aware of noises and predict where survivors may be. She‚Äôs a mind game focused killer. I will admit, prayer beads should be iridescent and have some sort of consequence to using it, but spirit herself is fine. I remember when she first came out and people labeled her as C-tier.
---
She‚Äôs not OP, it‚Äôs the fact that the people playing her have learned how to use her power effectively after a year of her being released. It‚Äôs nice to see a new killer up in the high ranks. I was tired of facing Billy, Nurse, and the occasional Huntress. 
---
Bottom line, just because a killer is good does not make them OP. ESPECIALLY if they can be hard countered.
---
He occasionally uploaded to YouTube.
---
FIX THE GODDAMN SERVERS I HAVE TO RESTART MATCHMAKING WITH FRIENDS SO MANY TIMES BECAUSE ONE OF US ISN‚ÄôT BROUGHT IN.

It's objectively not now that totems count as objectives
---
You should be fine, I mean you have to accept it anyway or you cant play.
---
Had the extra cells waiting for this to come out so I bought it right away, absolutely love the skin.
---
Thank you, I do try but I play alone unfortunately so I have to rely on fandom's and the match making is sort of a joke 
---
I'm rank 12 and will get a rank 8-13 killer with rank 15-20 teammatws which isn't fun. 
---
I just had a game where the one time I had a higher rank teammate (rank 6) they were pretty rank 20 skill lol. 
---
The game I had just then. I did 4 gens By myself and almost did 5 until I was got and pretty much insta removed from the Game, had no hope
---
Sometimes funny. You mainly watch them because of how good they are.
---
I kinda legit love this idea.  It would make her traps feel more useful creating more slowdown on the repairs and with the way they were adjusted to not work with EGC I don't think this would be overpowered at all.  She can never regain the old traps effects because hatch closing mechanic would break it but this is a great new idea for helping her out.
---
If it aint a cosmetic or DLC is not top priority from BHVR.
---
"no u" equivalent, very nice. Feeling daring today?
---
I'd love this.
---
And sorry for the 3rd reply in a row, but since we're asking each other stupid hypothetical questions that don't prove anything.
---
Do you think it would be fair if a nurse will ruin and all range addons got a free win against 4 solo survivors? Huh?
---
Low-amp filament is only better than yellow battery on the purple flashlight when paired with green battery I hate that bug, i always complain on the forums but the devs are more worried about fixing "survivors hair shadows"

More educational, at least Otz is
---
Nope.
---
This is why the emblem system is a joke, it encourages purposefully delaying the game just to get extra points in chaser or brutality instead of rewarding you for completing your objective.
---
I wasn't talking about personal grief you absolute tool. You were absolutely preaching anti-steroid as hard as you possibly could have without literally choking someone with them, and you used someone else's sorrow to make mention of it. Nobody was even talking about steroids until you came along.
---
And it's not just that you make mention of steroids, because that might be informative. You went and shit on steroids, rather than saying something as simple as 'The cause was most likely from steroids'
---
i know those were two unrelated sentences but i always need to let people know and like giving tips
---
Yeah that body blocking BS used to be really good when healing was an after thought and I've never been bullied in a survivor game, even Vs OmegaBlink Nurse etc. It's annoying the way that survivors moan about the killers who camp etc when they teabag and just generally take the piss out of them... Well no wonder they fucking camped??
---
Oh nice, and now another idiot has commented talking about needing a certain perk to counter Spirit.
---
Well, as a retort, would he think it's fun to have to be shit on every game Vs an SWF when not playing Nurse or Spirit?
---
Does it make it better when perks that are good Vs Spirit, (Iron Will, Quick and Quiet and Dead Hard) are ALSO good Vs every other fucking Killer including Nurse?
---
Is it fun that every SWF pretty much needs a Nurse or Spirit to counter them??
---
How do people exist like this man, they must just all play Survivor or are Bad at Killer or some shit. I don't get it.
---
Holy.Shit.
---
How did you get the clip from ps4?

Go into a game as survivor against a no-add Nurse. Let her hit you and run in a straight line. Don't try and juke or break line of sight. You will get downed by her next blinks. Just like you would if she was omega

you can literally do it yourself, fam

An old scruffy hunter with a wolf companion, Code Name: The Huntsman
---
*Stats*
---
Movement: 110%
---
Terror Radius 20 but if in within 32 meters, dog barks can be heard (Not directional)
---
Height: Tall
---
*Info*
---
Gender: Male
---
Dog's Gender: Male
---
Age: 67
---
Name: Roy Saladin
---
Dog's Name: Sumo
---
Homeland: In-view Valley (made up name, its somewhere in Texas)
---
*Power: Wolf's Reckoning* 
---
The Huntsman's dog Sumo will assist him in his hunt for terrified survivors,
---
**Sniff Out**
---
you can use sniff out on a generator with in 16 meters of you and Sumo will wander around the environment of the generator within a 16 meter radius and will start barking and pointing at any survivor that enters his line of sight
---
**Call Back**
---
call Sumo back to you by clicking the same button you pressed to tell him to do the action
---
**The Hunt**
---
5 Shrines with meat on them will spawn around the map, going up to one will cause you to feed Sumo The meat that is on the shrine and will cause him to enter *Bloodthirsty Mode.* While in Bloodthirsty Mode you will be able to send sumo after a survivor in a chase. Sumo's attack will become more vicious each level up in blood lust. This lasts for 70 sec and Sumo can only go after a survivor after 15 sec have passed
---
No blood lust causes sumo to injure the survivor and he cannot down them if they already are injured. 
---
Blood lust 1 will cause Sumo to injure and *Mangle* *the survivor for 40 sec* and Sumo will be able to down injured survivors. 
---
Blood lust 2 causes Sumo to injure, *Mangle for 60 sec* and *Hinder by 10% for 4 sec.*
---
Blood lust 3 will cause Sumo to instantly down the survivor.
---
Sumo will run towards the survivor and only stop if: 8 sec have gone by without hitting a survivor, the survivor drops a pallet on Sumo or the survivor is hit. The survivor is not able to juke the attack of Sumo through movement. Sumo will not vault windows instead he will take the fastest route around to get to the location of the survivor.
---
Perks:
---
**Determined**
---
The desire to make the survivors spill blood is irresistible. Breaking pallets while in a chase will not break blood lust but instead pause the count up to it until 2.5/2/1 seconds have passed  and breaking a pallet while in blood lust 2 or 3 will only bring it back down to one."I don't care what it takes, they're not getting away this time" -Roy Saladin
---
**Hunters Eye**
---
You've gotten good at predicting survivors movements. When a survivor fails any kind of skill check their aura is revealed to you for 3/4/5 sec. If they fail an altruistic skill check, they will be exposed for 10 sec. "Hiding from me is pointless, I can predict you before you predict yourself." -Roy Saladin
---
**Swift Grasp**
---
Practice has made your routine actions even easier to do. The time to pick up and hook survivors has been increased by 15/20/25% "I don't got time to waste, do me a favor and die faster."
---
So you clearly just recently learned the terms ad hominem and logical fallacy judging by the rest of the thread. Sad part is you're not even using them correctly. Pro tip, they are not "get out of argument free" cards. But I'm also positive you're a troll, so I hope you seek further education and better ways to entertain yourself. Goodbye friend.
---
WE DO TOO
---
Hmm, doesnt Sound that entertaining to me
---
Do you remember the meg‚Äôs gt? Might have been me, i‚Äôm a rank 15 meg main and was on last night.
---
not my cup of tea
---
What is the reason though? You do get the bloody skins though right? 
---
Do you think the time to get all those perks back is not worth the skins?
---
*Fuck*. ***Yes***.
---
Welcome to Reddit lol, that or people don't want to loose their META perks.
---
If you use both monitor and nurses just remember once you see their aura from healing, you have 12 meters before they are in your radius, the goal is to get it to where they are just inside your radius
---
Why is this downvoted lol. She just got off the hook, it was obvious she might have DS but he was greedy.
---
Bad manners
---
I love how she looks like Edgar from MIB.
---
Pretty sure he'll accidentally shoot himself in the foot or something.

Last year's skins have been in the store ever since then to buy with Auric Cells. If you mean letting you unlock them with event currency, I honestly have no idea, could go either way I guess.
---
Those glasses need to be less bright, they look like dollar store kids glasses
---
Bruce Willis was dead the whole time.
---
Straight from the official Discord.
---
Why the fuck would they give four skins to arguably the weakest Killer in the game right now?
---
Good for you
---
Low key roast, but good info haha
---
For one weekend? Goodness. What‚Äôs the point of new content if you‚Äôre never going to use it?
---
Because it nice to have your own trapper or other killer
---
No, but that's because your SWF is bad, like I said.
---
She is not A tier either
---
Imagine getting grabbed off a gen by Prayer Beads Spirit using that skin.
---
Same goes the other way around
---
Sounds like it‚Äôd be good with whispers as well. 
---
Especially with prayer beads around gens
---
Hex sudden betreyal sounds annoying. Getting punished for the noobs who self-heal 1% after every pallet drop.
---
Amazing!
---
It's your opinion. I'm not gonna hate on you for it. I just find him to be a complete jerk. That's my opinion. And I used to love his stuff until he was an asshole to that guy and got him banned and to me at a meet up so yeah, faith in him gone. But again, I'm not gonna hate on you for your opinion. You can enjoy his content because his content is really good but as a person... I'd have to say he's lacking
---
No, because we as a community need those Nurse nerfs, and I am beyond happy that they have been nerfed (There was a dev update earlier) That is necessary for balance.
---
I've said many times, OmegaBlink IS OP. Glad it's gone, cause I play and main Nurse without Addons. OmegaBlink is free wins, and that's not fun.
---
Here's the descriptions too if you want them:
---
*Finale*
---
Yeah, yeah, the world's been invaded by demonic freaks and you need me to save it. That's the soundtrack of my life, baby.
---
*Android Hand*
---
It feels like the real thing... Groovy!
---
*The Wastelander*
---
It's the calm before the deadites totally screw up your new jacket.
---
*Savior's Slacks*
---
Pants for the savior of mankind. What kind of futuristic material are these made from? Hm, it says here... cotton.
---
Now your using a strawman and are just flat out wrong.
---
Nice try.
---
You should consider Save the best for last or Enduring, those 2 perks can make a big difference bewteen losing and winning
---
the last year skins are still in the shop.
---
I‚Äôm still a bit uncertain about what OP is trying to say, but what about the Underground complex?
---
Agreed
---
so then she's just an M1 killer who is easily looped. and better survivors don't give a shit about being injured anyway
---
WHY ARE PEOPLE DISCONNECTING LITERALLY AFTER JUST THE 1ST DOWN, OR JUST DISCONNECTING IN GENERAL, JUST TAKE YOUR FUCKING LOST LIKE A CHAD INSTEAD CAN'T YOU? IF YOU'RE GONNA TEABAG, THEN DISCONNECT THE INSTANT YOU GET DOWN, YOU'RE A FUCKING DUMBASS D':
---
GOD FUCKING DAMMIT. AND WHY ARE THE HITBOXES SO BAD!!!!!!!! I'M TIRED OF GETTING HIT MILES AWAY WHEN ITS A GREEN FUCKING PING
---
GRRR
---
he no like pallet
---
And by the standards of reddit less than like 10% of all players are Rank 1 it feels, so it's still in the ball park.
---
You don't need insta heals to shit on a Trapper or Billy, it just helps.
---
&gt; Devour Toes
---
When I want to save a clip I press the share button then square and the clip saves to your PS4 capture gallery :)
---
It's always a good day when Skemooo uploads his renders
---
You don't want it to happen, so many boosted killers and survivors in rank 1 if this happens.
---
Just like before the rank changes a couple months back.
---
I'm the person that loves running No Mither so i'm crazy enough to do it but people don't like change even if it's temporary.
---
Didn't they have the ones that have the glowy stuff on them?
---
u/cowsiam REJOICE!!!!
---
Amazing work as always!
---
Best hope you're wearing brown pants when that happens
---
Wish meg could get one ;(
---
They can‚Äôt discern distance or direction so it‚Äôs sorta like you‚Äôre using the ghost soot addon but super loud and awful for survivors
---
This sub really hates Angrypug uh lmao
---
Look.... I try to be all nice and happy when it comes to this game. 
---
But the perk makes me Cringe.....
---
Didn't they say it'd be purchasable with Shards?
---
lol like ur literally punished for playing efficiently
---
You're basically having a contest to see how many downvotes you can get due to your own shitty reading comprehension.
---
Do you have a link to the leaks?
---
I have about 30 hours since it came out last week. Having a blast
---
Maybe instead of no terror radius, instead it's like the huntress, and it's some sort of noise instead, and its kind small so you won't be able to tell until he is really close. Just a small idea to even it out just a bit
---
Did they? If they did I missed it as so far for what I‚Äôm aware we are still in the dark on how much it will be and etc
---
Ah thank you
---
Yes but Dwight didn't get them. I believe Claudette did on the survivor side, unsure about others.
---
If you're maybe talking about Legacy, which is also glowy, no, you cannot get it.
---
I think trapper is great tho i think he definetly needs to start with more traps, but if u play him smart u can absolutely destroy but it may take some big brain plays
---
Im not a good trapper im just saying lol
---
Everything here sounds pretty promising 
---
I know people complain about matchmaking quite a bit but I do think that capping it at the highest ranking survivor as much as it sucks. Im red ranks and my friends hover around yellow/green so i get people's frustration when theres a disparity, but I do think its necessary to not average them in order to keep the game in a healthier state.
---
I lowkey think part of the reason dedicated servers aren't coming out yet is because they might try to launch it with cross-play functions. I don't want cross-play with PC. Just between Xbox and PS4. If they add PC cool, but it's not necessary.
---
If I witness you do that I'd praise you for 2 hours
---
Me as demogorgon:
---
Me: checks area, "welp nobody around"
---
Claudette That Was Literally Inadvisable: \*Closes Portal I Just Went Through\*
---
Me: \*DEMO SCREECHES\*
---
Take a break simply, you don't have to play it
---
Me and my friends aren't even that good at the game (if we ever get a Spirit or Nurse we might as well just give up on winning), but when we get a new killer player it's very obvious and feels really bad.
---
Yes i know that as i wrote above. :)
---
I forgot "imo" at the end of that, my bad.
---
all those perks sound better together
---
If you can't when the people have recommended, rank reset is probably your best bet, which is not next Tuesday but Tuesday after, typically
---
I need healing.
---
That's obviously not the meaning of the quote but you probably know that.
---
&gt; Battle Royale games have been left by many people for the amount of grind required to get your money‚Äôs worth
---
Where on earth are you getting this from..?
---
Fortnite, Apex legends, League, Pubg... These games are still VERY popular and they all have battlepasses.
---
I mean theyve had battlepass items for ages, (basically any event cosmetic), i dont see the issue with it especially just for cosmetics. I have no idea what your issue is with more people playing on mobile
---
Jane. Dat booty.
---
Lmao understandable, I like to switch up my perk builds from time to time and I know realistically speaking you should never run No Mither but to me it's one of the most unique perks in the game I've actually gotten salt from Killers even though I was playing with a handicap.
---
I was thinking they could do the same thing with these as they did with legion. Like different outfits give you a different character in the smileys to play as
---
I read "Tony Stank" and laughed
---
This is why killers should always be first person, i love the moments where i can hide right around the corner and not be seen when they walk past.
---
Nah Otzdarva did a whole build around Iridescent Seal and PWYF
---
Her new outfit is pretty cool. Especially her weapon becomes a drill of sort and it actually makes drilling noise when you get hit. I can confirm as I experienced that first hand last night.
---
Loosing
---
Seems like the obvious change to have made.
---
Don't you need my permission to share pics of me from 2 years ago?
---
&gt; Base nurse is fine
---
Literally the reason I get so agitated so easily as killer is cuz I waited an hour just to have a horrible time
---
Edgy reply Dreadkeeper, thank you very much.

Would you rather I not include it at all?

If you're talking about his Legacy Prestige, then no. They haven't been available since 2016 (never on console) and will never be available again.
---
I don't often being on my own items so this was the first time I noticed
---
Congrats... I mean if your getting out almost every game... while crawling with your teammate delaying enough time for you to crawl all the way out. Mhmm sure sounds like you should start streaming. Would be awfully easy to gain a following with that much excitement in your games, but hey what do I know right?
---
IHer main issue is that she completely negates the entire chase mechanic and completely ignores all of the survivor resources by just blinking through them. They should make her kit more in line with the other killers by giving her higher movement speed (110% , 4.4m/s). Give her ability a base amount of blinks (4 or 5). Give her a resource bar like the spirit/legion to regenerate her blinks. Make it so that pallets can actually stun her mid-blink. Rework her addons.
---
If u are killing 4 of these. You are not killer, you are savior
---
Its how to be a good player in general.
---
They should fix their lobby sync...
---
If only his dick was hanging out.
---
I think that the battle pass is separate

I did it once or twice and nah

Vigil: You're there for your friends in the toughest of times, acting as a beacon of hope in an otherwise dreary situation.
---
You, and survivors within a 6/7/8m radius Recover from Exhaustion, Blindness, Broken, and Hindered status effects 10/15/20% faster and decrease the bleeding frequency of injured survivors in range considerably.
---
Those affected by Vigil will remain affected for 15s after leaving range.

Its the best of the bunch by far, it doesnt mean ill get it as fuck spirit but it is a nice skin

idk y ochido isnt on the bottom of this list

Lol david is always the chad doing crap like that hahah
---
Stop playimg Spirit.
---
Melt?  Never heard that used as an insult before odd.  You have numerous comments all being downvoted in this thread lol it's more than 7 lol.  Not that it matters just a button but just funny that this entire part of the thread exists just because you didn't pay attention while reading lol.

but u already do :(
---
RNG killer that you need to play like a game. Save a bear trap for each survivor. Put bear trap on someone's head and  keep knocking them down until a generator is done, then follow them around while they do the boxes. If they live they live, if their head explodes, they explode. Make sure to roar the whole time.
---
The show is fantastic. I honestly think it‚Äôs even better than the movies- it‚Äôs hilarious, gory, and just such a fun time. His prestige outfit is what he looks like for about 70% of the show.
---
And this new outfit is the best choice they could‚Äôve chosen for his next outfit. Ever since it appeared in Season 3, it‚Äôs been a favourite of mine.
---
he was this SUPER TOXIC youtuber who was banned 2x by the devs no hes permabanned and no matter what he does he cant play so all he can do now is upload old content but he was so toxic he made the game bad for people and other followed making things worst for this community as if it wasnt toxic enough
---
As a person that plays Spirit a decent amount, I cringe whenever someone recommends predator or stridor.
---
No way man
---
No! WTF?!
---
Yeah I know the meme is old and dead. But as I said it was requested by a friend. We both chuckled and he insisted I post it so....

Hm. Your point is good
---
Yup, that's a good catch. And The Shining theme sounds a little derivative of Listz' Totentanz ~~and also Necropolis theme from HOMM3~~, which sounds a little derivative of Dies Irae, which is a fairly old Latin sequence. This is actually is a very popular motif you can find throughout the musical history.
---
No kidding! I‚Äôm still having fun so no hate on the game. 
---
I do agree some games are just ridiculous
---
Just last game the survivors were toying with me lol. I‚Äôm newer to the game but usually do well as the killer but these guys made me look like a toddler
---
No idea what you're talking aboutm
---
Is this happening specifically with Flashlights or all items?
---
Yeah I just wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt the only one who noticed this last night.  I literally saw no one when I went to smack the gen.  And then all the sudden it‚Äôs done and no one around.
---
nope Texas so central but whenever my nat type is moderate it take forever but once it opens I connect faster usually
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll check my NAT now
---
Hag is so brutal to have to learn, I hated having to grind to Ruin with her. But now that I did, honestly I enjoy playing her. It's definitely not for everyone to say the least
---
Lol! It's always flash lighting SWF Blendettes all with DS, Borrowed Time, Self Care, and Dead Hard. We a have our struggles.
---
As a killer main I am sorry for all the try-hards out there, but those games normally come after a good stomping if it makes you feel better.
---
‚ÄûI doubt these people gave a fuck about the killers they were seal clubbing‚Äú I spit out my drink. That‚Äôs just hilarious lmao
---
You can be feminine and gay but taking hormones and having breast implants is a choice
---
No. You are wrong. As someone who has sunk hundreds of hours into nurse playing both with and without range add-ons, you are 100% wrong
---
I was wondering it it maybe had something to do with which one you replace, I always replace the one on the right, was wondering if replacing the left or middle would yield a different outcome
---
I DECIDED TO PLAY SPIRIT AND GOT ORMOND &gt;:(
---
So what you're telling me, is perfect tapping requires sub 75ms ping, muscle memory, nearly 2 minutes of pixel perfect precision, and the planets to align flawlessly. 99% of people are not capable of pulling this of in 100 games. Sure, the perfect scenario is possible, not plausible. But toughing it out is still a better option 99.9999% of the tiem.
---
you can just look him up but just know hes not around anymore or remembers much so thats always good
---
lol i had like 800 hours before I learned how an insta heal and a flashlight worked. fml - solo player
---
Honestly just yes. Please. Just a pack of shaggy, daphne, velma, and fred for like $15-$20 and sell them separate for auric cells.
---
Probably licensing issues, I imagine they put the perks as general ones though like they did with Bill when he was PC exclusive.
---
What did "decreased accuracy" even mean?
---
your Demogorgon has more muscles!
---
LMAO
---
As far as survivor cosmetics, I really like the latest Kate cosmetics, they are really pleasant to look at, and fit her as a character. I've mained Meg since 2016 and they have just taken her into a strange, unappealing direction (along with Nea). Speaking from an artistic approach, they are just boring and/or poorly articulated.
---
Who tf is the bradette?
---
I think thanatophobia and dying light only work well together, they are pretty shit alone. But if i had to choose, i'd take off Dying light for Pop and replace Thanatophobia with Save the best for last
---
Well it‚Äôs far easier to get free from the killer with kb&amp;m.
---
HEY ARE THOSE LOWERCASE LETTERS
---
If it is one, I carry on as normal. If it is two, I spend more time stalking them and trying to scare them and sometimes I down them then walk away for them to be revived and wonder what I am planning. If it is three DCs, I usually just follow the survivor around and stand with them while they do their gens.
---
It depends on when they DC and how the other survivors are during the match; if they've been toxic, I'll play like normal and sacrifice them, but if they've been fairly respectable opponents I'll hook them twice and let them leave (usually)
---
To me, it all depends on my mood, or the circumstance. Sometimes I carry on like normal, sometimes I decide to let people farm.
---
There was a meh on the gen, you can see her jacket through the gens slit on the Right hand side when you go to kick it. It also helps knowing if it is being worked on kicking it is impossible, she just slipped away when you tried to figure out what happened.
---
If they have an immediate dc I give last person hatch as long as they didn't hard bm ot something.  If more than one DC's throughout the game again last gets hatch.  I always play fair so they get opportunities for points anyways.  If it becomes a total shitshow like 2 are on hook and last is being chased by me I'll often just turn around and kick gens so they can unhook and heal up for more opportunities at points.  I don't farm though so just let them get points through typical gameplay and give last hatch basically.
---
I'd settle just for cosmetics for existing survivors and then a scooby doo villain/monster
---
It's not high, but it's also more than just getting good perks. The other is maximizing your efficiency. Knowing which gens have higher defense priority, learning how to cut a chase short, mind gaming, learning map layouts and common loops, learning the strengths and weaknesses of powers, knowing what perks exist and do (there's 134 of them) and how to counteract them, how to listen for survivors breathing, and a lot of other micro-managing type of stuff. A killer with meta perks still isn't going to be able to beat competent survivors if they don't have that kind of knowledge of the game.
---
But why am I a rank 9 survivor getting matched with rank 20s?  I'm constantly lobby ditching these days because I don't want to play with potatoes.
---
I think it makes you easier to spot but at the same time, if you are in the killer's line of sight then they will probably get you unless you hide/outsmart them anyway.
---
I'm in rank 3 and I can't do anything half the time cuz if i chase a survivor for longer than 4 sec 2 more gens get popped and my ruin just gets smashed before I can even walk to it at the beginning of the game.
---
I just want quick match making idc who I‚Äôm vs lmao it‚Äôs a horror party game, not overwatch or LoL
---
R/hexruin
---
Yeah, i‚Äôd love a daphne outfit for meg.
---
To quote Otzdarva: ‚ÄúThis is why you only face sprits and nurses.‚Äù
---
Few things in the game are as satisfying as chasing a survivor right into a hag trap out of nowhere that had no business being there.
---
"Hey Julie look what I FUCK OH GOD"
---
I just keep going and laugh at them when it's their first down and they leave
---
I'm pretty sure Michael April done that intentionally as he was requested to make a horror theme so if he enjoyed the movie makes sense he would draw inspiration from it, good find though.
---
Buff Wraith by giving him an assault rifle instead of a bell
---
I mean, I hate this whole "teabagging isn't toxic" debate because its all about context, but in the context thats usually talked about (teabagging at pallets mostly) its *supposed* to be toxic. I don't get people who try to defend that in any way -- its meant to be a mind game to put down your opponent and psych them out.
---
I only run bright cosmetics. Playing immersed is boring anyway
---
The objective isn‚Äôt kill the survivors. It‚Äôs to please the entity. Not sure why it‚Äôs so hard to grasp.
---
Sick of playing with ones I unhook but don‚Äôt even come close to me when hooked
---
Some of the people in this thread disgust me, if they said the same crap that they are saying about white people, about other races it would be racist. Just double standards. 
---
Yes white people, black people, asian people, they all face discrimination. 
---
The simple fact that someone said in this thread that white people dont face discrimination is just pure wilful ignorance. Anyone can face racism and discrimination they need to get off their hate boner. Some people must live in a bubble or something if they truly think that. 
---
Like u/apoelakatop said, its all individual.
---
I slug the no mither when I play killer just for the memes
---
Where you aim with your blink, there's a small zone where you can land. The accuracy refers to where you land in that zone‚Äîin theory decreased accuracy it makes it harder to predict where you're gonna land after the blink, but in practice the effect is completely negligible because the zone is so small already and the effect is tiny in the first place.
---
&gt; She doesn't negate the chase mechanic, she just ignores looping. Like the spirit.
---
The Nurse can literally just ignore all pallets and windows wdym? No other killer can do that, not even spirit. She still has to move around the map just like the survivors do.
---
&gt; You can get a nurse to chase you for 5 gens, but if you attempt to loop a pallet then you will lose.
---
I'd love to see you try and loop a good nurse player for 5 gens.
---
&gt; Yes, so just don't loop. Double back around corners, fake window vaults, run tiles in an unpredictable way. Don't loop.
---
So you agree that she completely ignores the survivor resources?
---
&gt; Normal speed and blinks? Did you play this game when nurse first released? You just described her.
---
110% , 4.4 m/s is not normal speed, it is the same speed as Spirit, Hag and Huntress. Her blink regeneration would work similar to the Spirit's ability. They would have to regenerate over time so she can't use them infinitely like her current kit. How is that anything like when she was released?
---
&gt; They can and I have done it before.
---
Pallets can stun her, but there are instances where she literally can not get stunned by a pallet as she is blinking. If you actually played survivor you would know this.
---

It's amazing how little I find myself getting DS'd. In fact, the only times it happens are when I have a group with identical characters who are all injured, or when its the end of the game with the doors open, and tunneling is the only option I realistically have. Sure, that can be frustrating, but it's really easy to avoid a DS. And if you're that worried about it, slugging exists.
---
Yea I've only been playing since a little before Ghostface dropped (one of my favs as well) but ive seen some imteresting things so far. I'm use to hate mail, DCs are the worst. But every now and again you have a really great match with everyone. I see it as a game, you win some you lose some. Its all points, experience, and reminders of what not to do in the end. And yea I've been bagged many times by GF.
---
Well just today I palyed huntress and saw a pink shirt ace from a mile away but I think it's worth it to get a cosmetic that you really like for survivor, buying cosmetics for killer doesn't really do anything you don't even see yourself while playing killer
---
/r/IHadAStroke
---
But it is? Many of the most popular games are renowned for their toxicity. League of Legends is a prime example of a game that is more toxic than radioactive sludge, yet is still probably one of (if not the) most popular games in the world.
---
If your goal is to be harder to see then yes, wearing bright clothing would work against you. At the same time you could just say screw it and wear whatever you want. I'm personally of the latter opinion of wearing whatever I like most on what survivor I'm playing.
---
I KEEP GETTING MATCHED WITH KILLERS WHO FACE CAMP AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING. MATCHMAKING IS WAAY MORE BROKEN NOW
---
Run hag with her black skin and monitor and abuse and you tell me what the point is
---
I'll see you out there.
---
shittin in the tall grass
---
It's not a waste of time if all your team mates are far away or busy with the killer
---
Maining Laurie. You better kill me for good or I‚Äôll keep coming back. Just like you, dear brother.
---
I'm pretty sure I just played on a dedicated server on live. Players weren't showing their pings but there was a ping in the bottom right of the screen. Not gonna lie, the match felt REAAALY good.
---
Yea she's really small but you can see her for a short period also scratch marks pop up right after meaning she just slid right past as he went to look. Sneaky!
---
&gt;I've run the numbers and Ruin can easily double the amount of time it takes to do a single gen  
---
What numbers are you talking about? There are so many different variables at play that of course its *possible* that it can double the time, but how do you know its likely to the point you can say it can *easily* do it?
---
I'm telling you I can consistently do it in around 105 seconds and you probably can too if you try. You just need to tap as fast as possible while getting 18-20 points per tap. It's not difficult at all.
---
And if you can do that, it's better than getting 3 good skill checks.
---
nothing, i didnt work, the *idea* was that its would be harder to land where you are poiting at, but accuracy with the nurse is literally a meme
---
You couldn‚Äôt find a better picture of ZUB??
---
Just encountered a dedicated server game on live. I noticed that the survivors didn't have ping indicators next to their name but it was in the bottom right hand corner. Match felt SUPER smooth.  
---
  
---
At the end in the chat the session timed out after about 30 seconds with 'The Host has disconnected' with me as the killer.
---
This post was made by the rank 20 gang

whenever I just want some BP and don't depipping a bit, I'll pick Doctor with Distressing and just try to get 4 BBQ stacks and as much deviousness as possible. Anything after that is just gravy.
---
Ik it's a dead subject but Ochido should have his own section like 10 bars down from everyone else. But overall.. I'd agree with this.
---
Except the objective *is* to kill survivors...
---
MM was bad when a rank 3 survivor and a rank 17 survivor would end up getting a rank 17 killer. 
---
Its also bad to have a rank 3 survivor and a rank 17 killer get a rank 3 killer.
---
Why is it so crazy to just average it out and give them a rank 10 killer?
---
I literally cant watch Pug for more than 10 minutes before I'm annoyed of him, regardless of what game he's playing. He's a toxic as fuck person and all he does is bitch and moan, gets smashed every couple of days and sings at the top of his lungs to random songs, calls his viewers "nobodies" whose opinion doesnt matter, the list goes on. Pug is by far the worst DBD content creator
---
His name is Chonky Jesus, you HEATHEN!

Doctor: no

I already chose Freddy

when is it added into the game tho? just curious

Not only are bright cosmetics a bad idea, but so technically are larger male models. I main Ash and definitely notice that I stick out from behind stuff a lot more than say claudette or feng.
---
Lady survivors definitely have an advantage in stealth playstyles.
---
That's my go-to as well, that way I punish stupid behavior and have one more injured survivor running around.
---
The reason why Nurse and Spirit are the best killers is that you can't loop them. 
---
Or rather, you can try, but it won't work out for you.
---
&gt;The Nurse can literally just ignore all pallets and windows wdym?
---
Uh, no she doesn't. If I'm on one side of the wall and the nurse is on the other, just like every other killer, she can't hit me. Sure, she can use her power, but this is where the mind-game comes in; I can fake corners, fake window vaults, use tiles but run in unpredictable ways. Nurse ignores looping, not chasing. 
---
&gt;No other killer can do that, not even spirit
---
In the same way a smart survivor will not attempt to loop a charged nurse, a smart survivor will not attempt to loop a phasing spirit.
---
If you can't comprehend that other playstyles exist other than *"MUST FIND PALLET, MUST LOOP PALLET, ERROR, KILLER IGNORES PALLETS, GAME BROKEN, GAME BROKEN"* then I'm not sure what to tell you. 
---
I can get links to youtube tutorials if you want on how to run nurses, they helped me when I was new.

I believe you are refering to the legacy skins, which are not available anymore, and never will be again.

Can we give survivors character personality... like in-game and in-menue voice lines that fot their character.... 
---
Like bruh imagine david talking shit to the killer after stunning them with a pallet... that shit be gold.
---
And hell I'm a killer main but I wouldn't be against survivors getting passive abilities that fit their character lore.... something small not huge...
---
Of course killers as a whole need a huge buff... best way to do this is slow gen completion Time or buff and rework a whole bunch of perks...
---
Nurse is getting her nerf... and if they do buff killers I'd support a small nerf to ruin and a substantial nerf to no-ed...  a simple removal of the speed buff no ed gives you is enough.
---
The RBT still works during Endgame if the trap was put on before the last gen, I think.
---
Is that a fleshlight?
---
The Spirit's PTB came out in Sept 4, 2018. The last buff she receive.. the last change PERIOD she received.. was on November 6th, 2018 in hotfix 2.3.3 which made it so that the Spirit wouldn't glow white when she is phasing, finally allowing her to mindgame without it being obvious to survivors. This was a little over two months after her release and it was the last of several buffs she received up until that point. So I'm right. And that was almost a year ago.
---
And the uproar over her by low skilled survivor mains and their low rank survivor main streamers began 2-3 months back from today and is just them venting because toxic SWFs are getting their just desserts by going up against high rank killers who know all the intricacies of the game and won't be a doormat for their amusement.
---
When the Spirit was first released it was KILLERS who were voicing their displeasure at her. And it was due to how utterly weak and unviable she was against any decent survivor team. The &gt;only&lt; people who were saying anything about the Spirit when she was released were killer mains and high skilled survivor mains who were sick of only have two-four viable red rank killers. Killers got her buffed several times over the course of the next few months after her released, sir. And if the uproar was loud enough from low skilled survivor mains when she was first released I have zero doubt that all the buffs she received during the PTB up until her latest one a few months afterwards would have NEVER happened.
---
So spare me your revisionist history. I was around, I know exactly how it went down. This uproar by low skilled survivor mains is just pent up frustration at their believe that killers are getting too strong and survivors are getting nerfed in too many ways recently. So they decided to target the Spirit by perpetually stomping their feet, hoping that she will get Legion'ed.
---
Well it's not going to happen, so cry all you want about it. The Spirit is perfectly fine, has counterplay, takes skill, and is everything that EVERY killer should be.
---
I have feng dress and it‚Äôs amazing, I stick out like a pi√±ata but that‚Äôs the fun in the game. No point hiding you won‚Äôt improve, as when you do get caught you won‚Äôt be good at loops.
---
I respect it if the killer doesn't combine it with Noed, then it kinda annoys me.
---
Again, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a waste if I‚Äôm enjoying using it- which I really, really am.
---
That's the way it has been for a little over a year now. DLCs and cosmetics have been the priority. Cosmetic sets look great. Props to the team behind it, as well as those behind the last couple of DLCs. Gotta give credit where its due.
---
But meanwhile matchmaking has been a worsening problem since late last year. The game is still sub-par in terms of optimization. The same types of bugs keep reappearing whenever we have a major update. And the game is still harsh on new players.
---
You look at the tests they did with dedicated servers. The first PTB had hitbox irregularities especially with ranged killers like Plague &amp; Huntress along with other inconsistencies. Then the 2nd PTB came out. It was almost identical to the first, although a bit more stable. Little progress was made from what I saw. 
---
Which is fine. I understand that dedicated servers are tough to install on a game that's based on P2P connection. But then don't give a date for it. Don't say "Oh Dedicated Servers are going to come on Summer 2019!" Look where we're at now: October 2, 2019. Now they say they're coming this Fall. Well we're already at Fall. I, for one, dislike the idea of hyping players up about something just to leave them disappointed in the end. 
---
That is what happened with the "Optimization Patch" debacle last year on consoles. Devs said that there were going to be small optimization patches, finishing with the big one in December 2018. It never happened. People got angry for a while, then many just forgot about it.
---
DBD is a great game. I love it. But there are so many QoL changes and bug fixes that can be implemented to make it a lot better. But DLCs and new content bring in the money, and most of the playerbase will keep buying it, so I don't see BHVR changing its stance radically anytime soon.
---
Tru3Ta1ent?

ahaha you definitely got roeasted

Maybe instead of no terror radius in sane it‚Äôs like Freddy where he repeats all work no play makes jack a dull boy

---
because im an idiot who forgets where the escape line is exactly and when the killer comes i have this moment of "i'm close enough right?" and take one step forward to be sure and then escape and im like "oh"

The other team won hard and said GG. It's just what you say after a game. It acknowledges that you all played and tried to have fun. If people get mad they lost that's their problem.

CAN THEY PLEASE FIX MATCH MAKING IM SICK OF WAITING 20MINS FOR A 10MINS GAME AND PLAY WITH THOSE BABY YELLOW RANK SURVIVORS WHO DO NOTHING ALL GAME
---
Believe whatever you want dude lol, the fact you're a fan of his says all I need to know about you
---
What would you recommend? 
---
Also I would love to ask about one thing: against good survivors, I often have the issue that even though I activate the power further away from the gen, the survivors often somehow know I am going to them and leave the gen before I manage to appear there. I checked after the game, they are not running Spine Chill or anything similar. 
---
Is this just a SWF thing so they give each other a heads up,or is there a way to see when Spirit is coming to you? I even try to not go through grass so they don't see the grass moving.
---
It was committed by white people targeting people because they didn‚Äôt fit in their definition of ‚Äúwhite‚Äù.  How are you people so delusional?  The Holocaust is not a rationalization for discrimination against white peoples in any way.
---
no. they don‚Äôt.
---
I never said i was a fan, you are making presumption again
---
Rushing gens works best when everyone is split up though. That's why a shroud of separation is such a terrible killer offering. You can't have 3 gens pop in the first 60 seconds if they all spawn at the same place.
---
Ahh yes the person defending him, and apparently knowing his behavior well enough to comment on it, definitely isnt a fan and never has been. Logic
---
12 hooks in 5 gens is an obscure expectation
---
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO IF YOU‚ÄôRE CHASING ME (WITHOUT THE TBAGGING)
---
??? That‚Äôs exactly why it would be a waste of time? Because you‚Äôre not working on generators
---
Is all this matchmaking stuff a matter of SWF or is it also solo? Because I do not look forward to my rank 12 ass put up against a red rank killer. 
---
But then my 18 rank killer ass was getting stomped so maybe I should play more killer now.
---
yeah honestly i don't mind teabagging at the exit gate, they're just happy they made it *most* of the time and are celebrating.
---
now if you do that shit after a stun so help me god you better not or else I will **cry**
---
I think it'd be cool if searching a box with an inactive party hat activates it to avoid swf groups waiting to finish a gen until after someone gets their hat off. It also just generally adds more pressure so your hat has to be active for it to be removed
---
This this this. She gets wrecked so hard by organized teams with comms. I think she's a tad overrated because of this. Organized teams just run to trap deadzones after the first hit and set off 3 or 4 traps once you pick someone up. Good teams will force a Hag to chase 1 on 1, and that's a recipe for disaster.
---
He‚Äôs trolling you
---
Where did you get that info?  I can't find a date posted yet.

Oh well. Sounds like nice times.

I mean rank him on twitch streamers not really YouTube, his YouTube is just cuts from the VOD.
---
well u cant troll if you agree you dont know who that asshole is so I guess it's kinda funny
---
What am I even watching
---
UM, IDK OK I DONT PLAY SURV
---
Who‚Äôs an asshole?
---
I'm not defending, this is not like a fight lmao how salty are you? btw if you want to be a "nice guy", you shouldn't use the word cancer like that
---
I think I saw you make this exact same comment three times lmao
---
lol now I think your trolling
---
The buff I was referring to which unarguably made her a top tier killer was the change where they made her phase non directional and that happened maybe a week or two after release.
---
That hotfix you're talking about is not the reason spirit as strong as she is. 
---
I didn't read your comment beyond that first paragraph. I already know there's nothing of relevance in there.
---
Well, once a friend came back from vacationing on the beach and she mocked me for not being tanned. I felt very oppressed that day. There‚Äôs literally no difference between that and getting murdered by the police
---
Nah, I'm gonna use it when it fits the situation, and considering you're bringing me to stage 4, it fits now.
---
Now that's why you shouldn't stay any longer if no one else is in need of help
---
"uhh yes. this is Mr Stank right here" *cheeky smile*
---
fucking love that scene

i played private games against some friends and it took 25 tries until my friend finally got over to me and hooked me
---
Lol! Ik seitch version isnt the best but you make me laugh considering mobile is nowhere near as good as switch
---
Hmm not sure. The same thing happens to me once in a blue moon also where I'm stuck in crouch position and if I hit the right button on the controller again, it unsticks.
---
Been here for awhile hard to trigger it though
---
Maybe if console really got that optimization patch to help, then they‚Äôd be close.
---
I do work on generators, I usually go in with a three man team and a random, the three of us gen rush and get them done as quick as possible, have a fairly respectable win rate and a good tactic for unlocking eachother
---
"Bro"
---
I'm happy for the change to the matchmaking, but it does suck actually having a lot of low level noob friends.  They are way more hesitant to play with me now and they don't really like playing by themselves. Honestly I just wish they would introduce the ability to see the Killer's name in the lobby so I could message them.
---
"Hey, that Claudette is my friend and is genuinely a noob. We're just trying to have some good games. Please go easy on them." 
---
Killers can see Survivor names, and maybe they remember that person and want to dodge the lobby. Why can't Survivors? 
---
Alternatively you could just show Killers and Survivors each other's rank. You might get in the lobby and see that somebody is a red rank while you're yellow. I just wish they'd do something to help.
---
That's all the answer I needed lol
---
Love it
---
It would absolutely help queue times. However the framerate difference would also effect gameplay for console players. Console to console would be great.
---
I like how he smacked the door to assert dominance when he picked you up, just to get fucked
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam. 
---
Meanwhile, all the generators got done while you were following this one survivor.
---
I was also referring to the small player bases they have on both since they‚Äôre not as good as console or PC.
---
I don't think trap disabling should injure you automatically, *but* they should *definitely* make it a skill check, that if failed, injures you. But the rest of what you said I totally agree with.
---
They probably tried to play killer and couldn't handle their own medicine.
---
Survivors that are outside your terror radius hear a vacuum sound when you are phasing near them.
---
My current Spirit build is BBQ, Pop, Ruin, and Whispers though I'm considering replacing Ruin with Save the Best For Last
---
To be fair, the serum amplifies the entity's corruption or the character's theme so not much they could do with the plague, but they could have definitely made the boils and pus a lot more monstrous.
---
Do you feel better when you downvote me? that's pretty funny
---
Lmao his hand is smol, other than that it's still pretty good, I suck with markers.
---
Can you make more stuff like this please? Ireally like this story
---
Last event we could get every cosmetic, but it was a huge grind.
---
Wow! Can you get last year's stuff too without paying?
---
While I see a similar issue in my friend circle (one of my friends is red rank and I refuse to play survivor with him because of it), it's still better than the previous system, where as a rank 17 killer I was matched against a rank 2 survivor because he had one friend make a smurf account (rank 20, but clearly not new to the game).
---
It might not be perfect, but it's certainly an improvement.
---
Angel of Music
---
Feelsbadman, thanks so much for your help
---
Usually the rest of the survivors start crouching behind you and meming when they realize you're pretty harmless and not chasing them. Also
---
It's not about winning, it's about sending a message. XD
---
I've had my most hilarious matches on pig playing like this
---
nea‚Äôs cat sweater is pretty great.
---
People seem to be of the mindset that since killer players suffered from a bad system, now survivor players should have to suffer from a bad system. Why not just fix it. Matchmaking isn't a mysterious and unknown force. Just use a weighted averaging system like everyone else. They haven't fixed jack shit. All they've done is shifted the problem from new killers to new survivors.  
---
The bigger problem is rank reset. It's not our faults that BHVR decided to de-rank skilled players down to the ELO/MMR/whatever of a brand new player. Instead of fixing rank reset and their matchmaking algorithm, they implement yet another band-aid fix that moves us further from where we need to be.
---
I HATE WHEN THE FUCKING KILLERS DC 2 MINUTES INTO THE MATCH. I WAS PLAYING A MATCH AND THE KILLER DC AFTER TWO GENS POPPED AND THE MATCH LASTED 2 MINUTES AND I LOST A PIP BC OF IT I ALSO AND THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO. BHVR STOP MAKING US LOSE PIPS WHEN THE KILLER DC‚ÄôS
---
Well good job dunking on a severe baby clown.  
---
He should have gotten you right after you did the injured sprint burst into the tree.  Could'a popped you on both of the slow vaults on the window, and you threw down two pallets for no real reason Lolololol.  
---
When you want to run that loop the correct way fast vault from one window, then run across the middle and fast vault out of the opposite side then go around the building and do it again.
---
This is legitimately the funniest thing ever
---
More so the survivor side, kinda sad since I also play survivor.
---
SURVIVOR RULE #105.a DO NOT RUN AWAY PERKTHAT SLOWS GENS PROGRESS! DIDNT YOU READ THE RUKEBOOK?
---
‚ÄúThe others top tier‚Äù what do you mean, there is only 2 good killer apart from Spirit, Nurse and Freddy, any other thing will be destroyed by good SWF, Nurse is a really high skillcap killer and Freddy is a knowledge killer, Spirit I‚Äôd say is a mix.
---
If you're getting camped and tunneled, get good and mind game.
---
IM SICK OF HOW THIS GAME IS ALWAYS FUCKING LAGGING DESPITE THE FACT THAT I HAVE A GTX 1070 AND IT ALWAYS FUCKS UP MY SKILL CHECKS MAKES HITTING GREATS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE

*Glitch activated.*

Me fucking HATING to fight spirit but dumping all my hallow blight vials on her skin
---
What kind of boar is covered in smoke?
---
I just wish they would average it instead of basing it on the highest/lowest rank
---
Ah yes I think I can pleasantly pass on this one
---
Billy and Huntress are better than Freddy....
---
Ain't no need if you're last survivor about to get clapped anyway. Who wants to know when they're gonna die?
---
It does. But ANY chainsaw activation does. Bubba can use the stacks much better than billy simply because he does not have to move around the map with chainsaw.
---
.... oops. I wasn‚Äôt thinking about perks that already exists because of how focused I was on thinking about his perks sry
---
I nut every time I watch a pc clip. 5hose frames mmmmmm

As a survivor main, the best feeling is outfoxing an overconfident killer.

---
While we're on the subject of ranks. Can we also talk about the Monthly Rank Reset system? 
---
It's an important issue and doesn't seem like it gets brought up very often, It actually gets praised by some people just because they don't like the Rank at where they are at. 
---
I haven't played the game in a while, so I actually don't  know how things stand with it nowadays, but it pretty much killed the game for me. 
---
1. Queue Times at Higher Ranks 
---
Starting off with an example, players that have reached Rank 1 will be reset back to Rank 10. If they are good enough and return to Rank 1 faster than any other ex-Red Rank players, they would start having longer matchmaking times, because there wouldn't be a lot of people at the Red Rank Tier yet. 
---
Unfortunately, a somewhat of a solution to this was not play the game for the first couple of weeks. That's right, thanks to this system you'd get discouraged to play the game and to also rank up because of the long queue times you'd get. Because to this discouragement, red ranks would be even less populated. 
---
So what happens when very long queue times happen? You stop playing the game. Once people start doing this at Red Ranks it's even LESS populated leading to even longer queue times. 
---
 2 - Player Skill Disbalances between Ranks 
---
If a player has reached Red Ranks, then it's safe to say they've got some experience and skill. The level of skill varies between players on Red Rank and It doesn't feel consistent all the time because reaching higher ranks comes down to time grinding until the desired rank is reached. 
---
To me, it seems that the Monthly Rank Reset is supposed to fix this. 
---
However because of it, any players that are skilled can get pushed back to Lower Ranks because of the monthly rank reset, a place where it can be argued they don't belong. 
---
If someone that is very good at the game, doesn't play for two months and were Rank 1, would end up at Rank 14/15 because of the reset. 
---
What happens when they decide to come back? Well they HAVE to play against lower skilled players. It makes it a completely unfun experience for the higher skilled player and unfair for lower skilled ones. 
---
They either have to bear through it to reach the rank at where they should be or give up. Guess what happens if they give up. Any progress that they've made - can get reset IF they do not commit. 
---
On top of this less skilled players can reach higher ranks more easily, because the more skilled players would be at lower ranks. 
---
It's a huge issue, like I said it killed the game for me and my friends. We don't like going against inexperienced players it makes matches really fucking boring. All because we didn't play for a while. We might try to bear through it, but ultimately we just lose interest in the end.
---
You are replying like a baby, it's kind of boring so bye salty boi
---
That's entirely personal. It doesn't provide any benefit but if somebody wants to see it in the pre-game lobby that bad then sure
---
hopefully they do something else this year
---
This is my problem with the ranking system as well. I totally understand the bullshit with having purple and red rank survivors in your yellow rank game but at the same time, it's not exactly fair for the low rank people be forced to  play against a rank 1 killer. That is an easy way to turn people off the game. There are people who genuinely just want to teach their friends and play the game with them. Why is it okay to tell low rank survivors to get good but tell low rank killers that and it's a huge problem? It isn't fair for neither side.
---
But will the Clown love the gown?
---
I loved iw zombies
---
I miss being immersed hahaha, before understanding the balancing of this game, it was so so so scary to play and try to survive. I‚Äôll never forget one game where I, a baby Claudette, spent 20 mins looking for the hatch against a baby wraith
---
Says the dude who uses "baby" as an insult numerous times lol. The epitome of creativity right here folks, good ole Karkyy1
---
Okay, how have white men ever been marginalized? That is, for being white men
---
Yeah but now that I think about it. It would better if it was just the obsession
---
Not even close, Myers would lose to leatherface, billy, trapper, doctor, wraith, and demogorgon.
---
WoAhh
---
This is getting out of hand!
---
Now there are two of them!
---
Crossplay between the consoles would be better
---
What do you mean there's no mechanism? Funneling is a skill that is  used with every killer if you want to play at a high level, and there is literally an objective that forces map location in generators.
---
There is always a little bit of Ruin value but it does feel like it is less and less these days.
---
The only way yo ambush people on gens is to phase while they are in your terror radius and hope they think that you're chasing someone else, or use prayer beads.
---
They literally designed that tile for Head On.
---
Jacket from Hotline Miami aka ‚ÄúThe Animal‚Äù
---
The Big Daddy from Bioshock aka ‚ÄúThe Bouncer‚Äù
---
T-800 from The Terminator aka ‚ÄúThe Machine‚Äù
---
Yeah I left for awhile because the matchmaking was literally making the game unplayable on consoles for the longest time so I'm a returning player, been playing again for a few weeks and the changes are new killers are pretty great so far!
---
Killer FOV is shit, especially if you're tall.
---
What rank are you?  How many hooks did everyone get?  Did the other two who died get hooked 3 times?  Were you close in proximity to the hooks, because you mention a lack of borrowed time?
---
Vomits hitbox is wonky. Just fuckin dodge it i barely play survivor but plague aint a problem lmao
---
Disclaimer: We're not actually mean too killers it was just a joke.
---
Only thing that bothers me is the hard cap of a 6 rank difference. If I‚Äôm queued for an hour, but I can‚Äôt join due to 6 ranks, that‚Äôs just messed up. I shouldn‚Äôt suffer because not enough people can get close to rank 1. As it is it takes forever to queue as solo survivor on PS4, it‚Äôs gross compared to the other platforms how long it takes.
---
Nobody cares about this, i don't think you realize that
---
Given Demo's elephant demon feet, it should have that as a passive.
---
Or at least inflict a temporary broken status.
---
Yeah I guess there's something to be said for creating a distraction while others (hopefully) get some repairing done, as long as I don't become a huge liability who's always getting hooked haha
---
2 hooks in 20 minutes must be a shitty killer
---
Agreed. This is BHVR's fault really. They refused to fix the matchmaking. Instead of properly fixing the problem like averaging it out and give people more incentives to stay high rank (both killer and survivor), they just threw their hands up and said fuck it. Rank Reset is really just fucking stupid.
---
Astonishing how you've mentioned not caring numerous times, yet here you still are lol. Your behavior contradicts everything you say, I dont think you realize that.
---
Is this the Legion rework we've been waiting for?
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
None of those I would technically classify as "Horror" though..
---
And? You still have access to perks. 
---
Most perks aren't even limited. Only the most powerful perks have their big effects locked behind this objective, and even those are just limited to "spend a minute earning your perk first".
---
Imagine white boy in a very conventional family wishing to do ballet instead of football.
---
Reminder for the thousandth time, theyve actually pretty specifically stated, for not one, but two reasons, the creeper will never get added.
---
That clown is clearly a baby killer and nothing to be proud of. And you had to teabag at the end. Really now?
---
How can you tell, so I know what to look for?
---
I'm waiting in queue, i have time to give you all the the attention you need, salty boi
---
The bouncer is such a good idea!
---
I always wanted a hindered status after stepping in a trap, like your leg hurts and you can‚Äôt move well
---
I have no idea how annoying that would be as a survivor though, or if it would change anything at all
---
The game isn't a fps you seem to forget killers are in a fp pov. The huntresses hatchets arc but are always tossed to the center of the screen mostly so there is aim gap there. The nurse in a flick of the mouse can blink 180 way faster than a controller stick. Aim is a huge part of the killer POV knowing where to look when to use your ability for certain killers. PC players yellow ranks would be vastly better than a lot of the console players. Then there is the whole thing of fps console you fluctuate so much but half decent  PC can run this on low setting for a constant 60-75 fps and with the right monitor the PC person will react way better than the console user.
---
Okay, then killers staying around hooks because of  survivors going for unhooks and camping the hook are the same thing
---
yeah if he didnt come with the chapter there is near 0 chance he would be added to the game later on.
---
Thought you said you were bored and leaving? Or was the just more bullshit? Which is it sport, you cant have both
---
Every time someone complains about the spirit being unfun, another prayer beads appears in my bloodweb.
---
What were those reasons?
---
Oh yeah, they do for sure. But it‚Äôs 100% not favoritism. Btw, ¬´¬†unintentional favoritism isn‚Äôt possible, since you can‚Äôt have a favorite without knowing about it.
---
Because killers already don't have enough time to complete their objective.
---
I think doctors weapon is cooler prestiged for sure, the red and black outfit is what I use with it at P1, I may prestige more eventually but it's unique enough lol
---
I‚Äôve been using SpiritFury/Enduring on her and been having really good luck.
---
r/youngpeopleyoutube
---
My thoughts and prayers are with you!
---
I'm gonna get downvoted but, I recommend tanking your rank. I have the same problem. I have quite a few people I team with who can play decently well but have never gotten close to rank 1, and when we get shredded by some red rank killer, it's no fun for them. So now I stay in purple and our matches aren't as lopsided.
---
Metal.....  
---
Gear....
---
I like this alot, fits him really well
---
For me it ALWAYS feels like the survivor gets out as you get close, either just in time to run and start a loop or just too late and they get a smack
---
Got down voted for admitting that this subreddit is more killer sided, thats a yikes
---
How does being trans work tho?
---
Why do you crybaby survivor mains complain about noed if you can just find it and cleanse it?

Hindered is super weak, so I would think it would almost go unnoticed.

Honestly, I'd say its only actually a problem if they actively go out of their way solely to down and hook you over and over, like if they completely ignore every other survivor, even other injured ones just to find and hook you to death then yeah they're just being an asshole. But if you're the only one they keep running into then that's just bad luck on your part. As a survivor main i will agree its annoying to deal with and even i will complain about it sometimes but in the end its just bad luck.
---
TBH I thought of the perks and then remembered they were all faces after. Made this even beter imo.
---
I think the reason why they reused the original face is just for a placeholder
---
Maybe if you had to mend or something to remove it?
---
Yeah, but was it dull or a hex?
---

Bubba isnt the smartest and has been injured I dont think we've seen myers get injured also how the trapper wraith and doctor? I can possibly see Billy or demogorgon
---
I feel the message behind this exquisite meme
---
Both if the pigs are so good and i cant decide. Other amazing ones are candle boi wraith, come to think of it all Wraith purple skins, Vigo Claudette or the Kate Denson Biker skin
---
Well, hes not wrong. Here is one my favorite comments from guy who was contemplating if this is the game worth pursuing to learn:
---
*as soon as they find out im a inexperienced killer, they stop playing the game, and play the new game of "loop the killer", i had a match against a full swf group where while 1 of them was looping me, the 3 others would be watching from a distance, standing there and pointing.*
---
Yeah I get the bad luck part. I was talking about when a survivor is directly unhooked just to get smacked back down and hooked instantly
---
I have a feeling a lot of the FPS issues are related to connection. Because theres some games where I run just as well on PS4 as I do on PC, if it was the hardware it wouldn‚Äôt be random like that. So if they can manage to fix that then I think full crossplay would be great, and since people complain about the possibility of getting paired with a Mouse using Huntress (Wont really be to bad compared to FPS games which already have crossplay) then they can implement input based Matchmaking that way friends can play together regardless of platform.
---
I swear I have seen this exact clip posted here before :O
---
That was literally me for like 3 whole months just hiding 24/7 hahahah. I remember I used to get so excited when I hit green ranks
---
Mood, the survivors and when into the match. If I face a non toxic team and one of them D/Cs on first down I'll just 2 hook them all and leave.
---
If 2 d/c early in the game then ill let the other two go since I know the pain
---
Literally i treat survivors how I want to be treated, not letting 1 asshole ruin someone else's game because thy were a lil bitch
---
&gt;now survivor players should have to suffer from a bad system. 
---
No, Survivors now have to play with a system that no longer lets them combine the bonus strength of SWF+ Voice comms with being able to be matched up with weaker players.  
---
&gt;Matchmaking isn't a mysterious and unknown force. Just use a weighted averaging system like everyone else. 
---
They've tried averaging the ranks out. Survivors abused it. Much like how the canker sacks from the last Hallowed Blight event were axe'd because survivors would abuse those and just suck-suicide-repeat to get their tokens instead of playing the game normally. It's kind of the reason we can't have nice things. 
---
&gt;All they've done is shifted the problem from new killers to new survivors. 
---
New survivors have the option of being completely unaffected by this. Just don't group up with your Green+ Ranked friends. Wow, it's that simple. Let them learn the game via KYF lobbies and their own solo experiences, and then once they've gotten the hang of things bring them into your SWF games. Now they get the best of both worlds! 
---
&gt;The bigger problem is rank reset
---
I'll agree with you on this one. It feels very antiquated given no Rank Rewards exist to this day.
---
I dont get it.
---
Yeah but the 3 others would chase him into the portal he made
---
Wraith with cape is awesome, he is one of my secondaries and i bought all of his purple skins because they all look so good. Personally, candle boi is great meme, but my favorite is the new Route 66 one.
---
I am uncomfortable
---
It's the Negachin!
---
Okay that would be cool
---
That‚Äôs a great one too.
---
You should get burnt pincushion if you have enough with the body of the black and red outfit, it makes ya look spooky
---
Sorry, i didn't mean it like that. I wanted to know how do i get the clip from the gallery?
---
Im rank 7 and the 2 survivors I killed one got 3 hooked and the other got 2 hooked and the one that dcd got 1 hooked. And they unhooked her in front of me as I put her on hook
---
I can't pick her up.
---
I agree with you base nurse is mostly fine, but if it's a Nurse with something like Ruin and NOED or some other perks that feel cheesy on her, it gets pretty boring.
---
Gross.
---
Crossplay has input based Matchmaking. If your playing by yourself on PS4 you wont get paired with PC killers.
---
I READ THIS IN DANNY MCBRIDE'S VOICE, WHICH MADE IT ALL THE MORE BETTER.

DEAR KILLER, IF I HAVE LOOPED YOUR ASS ACROSS HADDONFIELD ON MULTIPLE FLOORS, PLEASE FUCK OFF AND GET THE SURVIVORS THAT HAVE PROCEEDED TO GENNY RUSH YOUR ASS BECAUSE I HAVE AN INSTA HEAL.

I linked my YouTube account to my PS4 and if you press share on the captured video It gives you the option upload it to YouTube. I privately upload it to my YouTube and just screen record it on my iPhone and post it here :)

Because it's not fair. It's a terrible idea, to cross a console killer vs pc survivors or vice versa. Don't do that.
---
Put a generator on the coaster lmao
---
This is not console. This is babies all around.
---
You literally cannot counter tunneling on your own if the killer has half a brain. It's all up to your teammates.
---
Extracurricular Susie for Legion is probably my favorite killer outfit
---
Devil may care Joey is also an excellent skin
---
As for survivors, I really enjoy the pink haired Nea grafitti artist outfit
---
I just love Phantom of the Opera
---
DEAR KILLERS, STOP TRYING TO D/C BEFORE MY FRIENDS AND I LEAVE. IT TAKES UP TO 30 SECONDS TO REGISTER. WE OUT. AND YOU GOT ZERO POINTS AND TWO LOST PIPS FOR THE COST OF FREE.99

---
It's not displaying the button prompt to carry, at least she'll bleed to death.

Or we could actually wait for it to come out to see how fair or unfair it is before making a fuss.
---
Borrowed time and Adrenaline are probably the best two. 1 exhaustion perk and for that it's either Balanced Landing or Dead Hard. Dead Hard is a bit more popular imo. For the 4th slot the most popular is probably Decisive Strike although that slot is a bit more open. Borrowed Time and Adrenaline are a tier above everything else in my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs a weird one. I don‚Äôt cleanse but if one teammate goes and cleanses, then I go and cleanse. 
---
I also run DH 90% of the time so it helps
---
Damn lmao. Yeah. I'm 100% a survivor main now. I haven't played killer in a long time
---
Probably be another 3 years before that happens
---
Haven't played DbD in docked mode, but I can tell you that it looks really good in portable mode from my experience. I'd say I have roughly 30ish hours in the game since it came out and it's been a lot of fun.
---
Couldn't have put this better myself. My best rank is around 6, and my friends are 12, 15 &amp; 15. I don't even think I'm that much better than them, I just play solo a lot more and end up ranking up until I get absolutely murdered by level 6 killers. Before 3.2 we would get competitive games with levels 8-15 killers. After 3.2 we were getting super soft games with levels 18-20 killers who didn't know how to use their powers. It was broken. Last night we played and we got killers leveled 3 and 4. It was ridiculous. My friends simply don't know what to do with relentless killers running some combination of BBQ, ruin, nurse's calling, PGTW every single game. They can't do gens with ruin up. They don't know the killer perks. They don't heal each other right away which is a disaster when every game is against spirit. If the killer gets 1 or 2 kills in the first 3 minutes of the game, that game is over for everyone, regardless of the remaining survivors' levels.

All I can think is BVHR must be hard pressed for killers because I don't know how they could think this change would be helpful for onboarding new survivors--at a time when they're expecting a bunch of new survivors with the Stranger Things chapter. I'm also amazed how some people on here think respecting the strict code of killer/survivor balancing should be more important to me than someone playing a video game with their friends. "Find new friends closer to your rank" or "stop playing with new players just so you can game weaker killers" are just nonsensical statements to me. I'm not surprised your friends went back to playing other games. My three friends are into the game now, but if this was the matchmaking then, they would have never gotten into this game. If killer mains think that's a good thing, they must like tripling their queue times while the survivor base never grows.
---
Clearly balancing is a difficult problem to solve with a 1v4 game. But it needs to go back to an average of the SWF ranks with a weight towards the best ranked survivor or this player base will not grow. I don't think it's that crazy.
---
IF ANYONE LOOPS ME 2+ GENS GET PREPARED FOR A FACECAMP BUDDY
---
I have the game on all consoles (Xbox One X and PS4 Pro) and PC. It runs at 30fps on those consoles (mainly Xbox) and 62fps on PC without modifying the files. That alone is a disadvantage for console players, especially for killers. 
---
You're talking about lag. Which is a separate issue entirely and one that would make it even worse for console players.
---
It‚Äôs only spirit now, I haven‚Äôt seen nurse or billy in weeks
---
Lana Dumham is honestly a fucking idiot
---
&gt; These addon reworks won't be enough to bring the nurse to an acceptable level of strength. 
---
Acceptable to you does not equal acceptable to anyone else, nor is it acceptable to the health of the killer. She's not suppose to be your plaything, she's suppose to be a serious threat.
---
&gt; She needs a rework to her base kit
---
GTOH with that suggestion. Base Nurse is perfectly fine, and highly skillful. More skill is needed for survivors, not even more skill for killers.
---
1. Yeah they get all their perks immediately.  They also end games in four minutes. Just because it's currently the case doesn't mean it should always be like that. 
---
2. Nope. A good survivor can go toe to toe with the killer for minutes on end if it isn't Nurse. They *should* only be 1/4 the strength,  but that simply isn't true. 
---
3. With these changes survivors only need to spend 1/3 the BP on a character.
---
4. So survivor mains will quit the game if it starts being a challenge? I doubt they're *that* childish.
---
I adore it when a survivor just circles around a hook, waiting for me to slap them so they can unhook for free, and I just allow them to wait out the rest of the sacrifice timer and kill their buddy through their own inaction.
---
Yup he was reworked to require skill to play so noobs couldn't just throw on Frank's Mix Tape and spam 3 missed hits before connecting with their 4th and proceed to uncounterably tunnel or moonwalk downs.  No offense to you personally.
---
Gen rushing is kind of vague tbh, what do you define specifically as gen rushing and how do you propose it be fixed
---
and then you cleanse it and **Exposed**
---
Yes I'm sorry but fuck PC users. You have too big of an advantage over console.
---
BRUH
---
Play as killer if you get ping then you know
---
Terminator or the terminator (Terminator franchise)
---
Joker or The joker(batman)
---
Shinok or the fallen(mortal kombat)
---
Deadite or the Deadite(evil dead)
---
Annabelle or The possesed
---
i'm 2 pip away from rank 1 survivor if it interests you
---
boil over needs 6 buffs
---
You waited 20 minutes to come back to this and say that lol, cute
---
The 200 IQ play was equipping decisive strike I guess.
---
They had that implemented and it was fucked where the highest ranked survivor was being paired with the lowest rank killer and they said it was broke so reverted to that what we have now.. BhVR at its finest! 
---
‚Äú Good JOB So FAR ‚Äú
---
Bigger pool of gamers to play with ... Good! 
---
Getting our ass kicked by a keyboard and mouse..bad.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. If you're going to cleanse the ruin at least go a gen that's not right next to it. Especially at the start of the match when no one's been hit and chances are the killers heading to the totem.
---
That was a baby killer tho or at least a really bad one, might as well flex on a toddler at the jungle gym. He deserved to lose that match
---
I'd rather not. Maybe between Xbone and PS4. Maybe.
---
That would definitely reduce queue times on console both for killer and survivor though I have seen issues with infinite loading screens when trying to return to lobby and getting dsynced out of SWF at random intervals.
---
Small minded thinking is that this is only about snares, the issue is add ons like Swing Chain combined with perks like BBQ and Pop goes the weasel. It only takes a few moments to walk away to another area as Freddy and tunnel the one being unhooked. The person doesn't get borrowed time and they don't get to escape due to the killer speed making it a guaranteed solo kill requiring D.strike to escape.
---
This isn't even including that you're free to regress a generator of choice by 25% and make it a hardship thanks to something like Swing Chain.
---
I havent got dead rabbit in last 20ish bloodwebs so theres that.
---
I had a billy 4K me on shelter woods and I thanked him for not playing spirit
---
Cross Platform Mori's incoming
---
im sorry- the minute i saw them i was like "ohgod oh god"
---
I got to rank 11 before day 3 of playing killer so I mean.. you can still be new and climb up the easiest ranks ever.
---
Reported lol /s
---
don't do it - its not worth it :C
---
Me too. On ps4. I get it when searching, after games, even just sitting when not searching, while putting blood points in blood web, it's getting rather annoying being booted to main screen every 2 minutes.
---
Yeh I love the design of Clown but damn is he boring and weak to play. And while his wheezing in the lobby triggers my asthma I do enjoy his in game joviality.
---
I think it is his bland add-ons that need spicing up. Add more variety in his gameplay.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm completely apposed to do, but it really depends on what it is. It would have to be an objective that would take time but wouldn‚Äôt be impossible to do with the gens. I kinda want something more than just holding M1 and hitting space bar. And it would have to reward enough blood points to motivate the survivors to do it.
---
dEciSivE sTrIkE iS bAlEnCeD
---
I'd make it
---
first leave: no ban
---
second leave: 15 min ban
---
third leave: 30 min ban
---
fourth leave: 1 hour ban
---
fifth leave: 3 Hour ban
---
sixth leave: 5 hour
---
seventh leave: 1 day
---
STOP CLEANSING AGAINST PLAGUES YOU MORONS
---
Your backpedaling on yourself. Those things are gameplay mechanics and should have zero factor.
---
He wrote a list of 3 things - 2 are simply people trying to play the game.
---
The game is literally unplayable for the past 1.5-2 hours.
---
Nurse's ability isn't ideal for loops cause your speed is slowed down to a crawl when attempting to blink that and you lose bloodlust when they manage to escape.
---
Timing of the blinks is key to downing any survivor otherwise poor timing of it will screw you over.
---
Spirit after McDonalds
---
I‚Äôd probably still be accused of lag-switching
---
Jane and David have all the personality a survivor needs. Oh yeah Ace too
---
Shouldn't the title be "why cross play shouldn't be with pc"? Unless I'm completely stupid(very much possible lol) these seem like arguements as to why it shouldn't be.
---
seriously. what more do you want entity! lol
---
Nothing besides a skin.
---
I don't know if you're trying to call me a noob or whatever but I've only played Legion for the span of a week and that was a long time ago. You're making it sound like I played Frank's Mixtape all the time even though that's not the case. The op asked what the best add ons were and I answered. Anyways, no offense to you personally but I don't care enough as I don't even play killer.
---
I am not backpedaling. Those things help paint a picture. They are doing annoying things and BMing on top of it.
---
Also campers are simply trying to play the game, tunnelers are trying to play the game. You gonna defend those too?
---
Which came first, Toxic Killers or Toxic Survivors? ü§î
---
I hear you but, ita a change of pace from the game. Everybody complains about every event we have ever had. I honestly dont care if they add the plant or make it the genus but people dont seem to care for either. 
---
I just get excited that it's something fun an interesting to break up the normal game/gameplay and add some interesting decorations/feels go the maps.
---
Hopefully just with Xbox or let us opt out cause Ik I do not want to play with PC players
---
While that would actually be cool (and seeing that your memeing, so I'm sure you know) but we might possibly be getting pennywise.  But a spooky spider would be cool
---
I dont really like the idea of adding a killer s√≥ human looking, sure we have the legion but at least they wear masks.
---
I think you mean... gained.
---
same i think meg looks better in her standard outfit than most of her cosmetics in the store
---
Allow ppl the ability to opt out for it like fortnight does
---
Legacy nurse with ruin?
---
*sadness oinks*
---
Even if I don't get a kill, farming with BBQ stacks, deviousness, and an offering gets me 20-30k. Honestly that's just how I play and I've made it to rank 11 with blood point perks. He's not super viable above that (for me at least) but I still rake in them perks
---
Honestly, i hate playing against Spirit but this would make it more likeable
---
It's amazing
---
Except PC players have distinct advantages over console players and putting then against each other would be completely unfair
---
You just said they are annoying to you.
---
&gt;Also campers are simply trying to play the game, tunnelers are trying to play the game. You gonna defend those too?
---
I don't care if they wana do that, go ahead. They are strategies, even if they are shit ones.
---
I'm not going to start playing scummy if someone tunnels or camps, I mean it's not like survs even have the option to do that but there you go.
---
*sad oink*
---
infinite traps? With this idea a Trapper with bloody coil would be better than Nurse LMAO
---
personally thats not really my experience playing dbd im pretty chill but thats probably because i have never made it to rank 1
---
I LOVE THIS COMMUNITY!!
---
I mean red ranks always say they want to see someone other than Nurse/spirit lmao
---
Oh I get it.
---
I only do it when the survivors were being toxic first.
---
Like I said in my post I only wanted to do it cause the Steve kept teabagging at every pallet.
---
*I'm stuff*
---
Just put a limit on it like hags traps.
---
Or those times someone is trying to heal you but the Killer is RIGHT THERE or you're running Inner Strength/Resilience/etc. and you don't WANT to be healed but they keep following you and forcibly starting the animation over and over again.
---
These people would get Sudden Betrayal to max power in 3 mins flat.
---
Moon walking is not impossible on console what are you talking about it? Many ppl do it. Also just allow ppl to opt out of it some ppl just do not wanna play with PC users and there is nothing wrong with that
---
Oh I have. It wasn't fun
---
&gt;How many you found is anecdotal, as they‚Äôre are tons of videos of it for PC, but extremely few on console. Let‚Äôs not even bring up the hacker who shall not be named, who hacked in Not_Queens lobby. Besides, other points still stand.
---
I mean... if you look for videos of people cheating of course you'll find tons of videos. That doesn't mean the creator of those video didn't get ban in the next hour considering they have infinite amount of accounts scammed from kids who click on the links put in the description of said videos.
---
You just need to go around asking your friends, streamers or general members of the community how often or how many times they encountered cheaters.
---
With r u i n?
---
Ohk i dont watch every dbd video so i mustve missed this one which is bewildering since i really only watch the survivor videos since theyre more intense than the killers and you have more moments in them were you actually can get some jump scare/comedic moments vs killer you just see him run around and hit people, so not so many of those moments for watching killers perspective
---
You mad bro?
---
Cutting corner optimally is easier on PC. That is probably the main thing. I feel like if a console killer chases an optimal pc survivor, it may feel like the survivor gets a lot of distance on the killer.
---
I don't know for sure but it wouldn't surprise me with the crazy shit people are on nowadays.
---
Cause probably possibly it didn‚Äôt happen
---
At this point its all killers that arent licensed except Nurse and Legion.
---
Exact opposite. Survivors are mostly toxic little shits
---
But they literally didn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt name the person, but him and a group hacked for MONTHS, including in the developers matches. They were literally incapable of keeping them banned, as they kept getting past. The one guy still isn‚Äôt banned, he just moved on. Literally unable to get him, ever.
---
Moonwalking is very possible on console lmao.
---
Most Pig Players (about 75%) tunnel whoever have a trap on their head. The nerfs don‚Äôt make me feel bad for them at all.
---
No joke it did happen
---
I just went and looked. Wow, just wow
---
I googled. Shes this dumb for real.
---
Exactly, fuck PC users. If you think you should get to destroy the experience of other people on different gaming systems because "for my buddies", gtfo. Go buy a console then.
---
You can not walk backwards as survivor on console. That requires you to be walking forwards after turning and then pressing the side directions while moving. You can not do that on an analog stick
---
When I knocked the survivor down my totem broke
---
Still got the whole "keyboard and mouse is clearly superior to joysticks" thing to deal with.
---
I've learned to never be greedy after endgame collapse, altruistic survivors will mess your day up if you leave that hook, or just don't take a downed person to a hook like here.
---
Yes. This has nothing to do with what I posted. I'm not comfortable without ruin at this time.
---
Ever have diarrhea man but it dont hurt coming out?
---
we still have that on mobile
---
WOUNDED HEALER IS STILL FUCKING BROKEN.
---
That's where your wrong.
---
Cant wait for hallowed blight. Thanks for all the awesome uploads!
---
I gave you my reason, where‚Äôs yours,
---
(PC) NURSE IS FUCKING BULLSHIT AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE MY MIND. SHE WAS ADDED BACK WHEN SHIT LIKE PALLET VACCUMS, OLD EXHAUSTION AND INFINITES EXISTED. IT'S LITERALLY NEVER BEEN EASIER FOR KILLERS TO PLAY THE GAME AND THE DEVS STILL HAVEN'T TOUCHED HER. (OH NO WAIT THEY FUCKING BUFFED HER BY LETTING HER BLINK UPWARDS.) IF YOU BRING UP THIS COMPLETE BULLSHIT ANYWHERE YOU GET YOUR ASS DOWNVOTED RIGHT AWAY BY SALTY NURSE MAINS GOING "NuRSe tAkEs sKiLlLzz". WELL YOU KNOW WHAT?! YOU CAN TAKE THAT "SKILL" AND SHOVE IT RIGHT UP YOUR FUCKING ASS, YOU OMEGABLINK USING PILE OF ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.
---
His hands are my favorite part.
---
Hex: Made You Look
---
David is so good I never to get to use aftercare on more than one person and he got two
---
Because you can do it on analog? I play on Xbox?
---
Whoa excuse me fella didn‚Äôt know we were talking to mr.richie rich over here just buy a console. Also I‚Äôm rank 14 survivor rank and I play like a rank 20 so first if all id get my ass handed to me
---
I GOT OUT OF THE BASEMENT WITH THIS ONE GUY AND NEXT THING I KNOW HE BROUGHT THE KILLER BACK TO ME, I WAS FUCKING PISSED!!!
---
You don't have to tunnel and camp. Survivor you hooked 20 seconds ago tries to do gen? Gotta slug or pull them off. And if you pull them off they have a get out of jail free card. Slug them and wait and they rage quit.
---
Last year was shit for both sides. Survivors would get the plants then kill themselves and killer got so little juice for hooking. 
---
This year is diffrent. Its more in line of the summer bbq with the genarators being infecting and giving you juice and probably same for killer as last year. (According to leak)
---
wait whats the difference. or is it supposed to be not different as a joke
---
Eh, not like stealth gets you past purple ranks anyways, if even that far.
---
yes it does. if they try to heal while you're running with that button they're heal slower
---
You can walk backwards? As survivor? While moving at full speed?
---
Overlook Hotel would be bitchin as a map.  A huge sprawling building with a hedge maze outside?  Yes, please.  
---
Who would be the survivor?  Wendy?  Hallorann?
---
What did they do to enduring?
---
I always loved the idea of a spider based killer. So I hope we get one soon.
---
Just wait we get new clown skins we had that art contest and the new hallowed blight
---
Bro it just sounds like you're not very good at this game and know an influx of new players will make the game that much harder for you.
---
i was thinking wendy, but im not really sure.
---
But Jenner's last breath is Evie wormhole, it will be fun af.
---
You may have noticed I stated I wanted Xbox and PS4 cross play. That‚Äôs a massive influx right there.
---
Boom, destroyed.
---
You fricking horny bastards destroying my sanity in the comments
---
They want more variety but want mechanically demanding killers with counterplay to versus. Spirit isn't mechanically demanding, and Nurse makes you play a completely different game.
---
Yes. You can.
---
I DIDNT FUCKING SAY IM GOING OUT OF MY WAY TO RUIN IT FOR THEM, IM SAYING I LIKE PLAYING THAY WAY AND IF YOU DONT FUCKING LIKE IT THEN TOO BAD, (ALSO, BLOCKING PEOPLE GOES WITHOUT SAYING, DO IT IF YOU DONT LIKE PLAYING WITH ME, I MAY NOT DO IT OFTEN BUT HEY ITS OK!)
---
HEY BHVR - STOP NERFING PIG. WHAT HAS SHE DONE TO YOU?   
---
ALSO, WHY NO LEGION HOLLOW BLIGHT? I DON'T PLAY THE KILLERS WHO GOT ONE, I WANT STABBY GLOWEY POWER.   
---
THE BIGGEST F IN CHAT GOES TO FRANKY BOI MORRISON TONIGHT
---
Alright, tell me how? What do you do with the sticks?
---
Perk idea: All work, no play
---
Starts with 5 tokens
---
Each token increases movement speed by 1%
---
5 tokens applies exposed to all survivors
---
You lose a token after either losing a Chase, or chasing a survivor for longer than 30 seconds
---
Gain a token by hitting a survivor within a 30 second chase
---
With all due respect but it you don't play killer and you don't keep up to date with major overhauls that hit the game ages ago I'd recommend avoiding offering advice on killer topics then.  Like I don't know anything about Nuclear Fission so I'm not likely to participate in a discussion about it.
---
WTF AM I WATCHING the average player on this sub btw
---
I never thought I‚Äôd see a proper shitpost here. Thank you.
---
I actually never saw demogorgon's stun animation. Really cool
---
NO! If they do that I'll uninstall and never touch the game. Crossplay between Consoles and PC is most of the time a bad idea since in most games pc players have advantages due to more precision and more fps.
---
With Distressing, you can easily get max Deviousness without even getting a single sacrifice. It then comes down to how often you get hits/hooks, but you can average like 20-30k a game without even getting a sacrifice and before chili
---
Splish splash, your opinion is trash.
---
Self care dance &gt; clown bottle dance
---
The pig getting thought about usually leads to a nerf.
---
I was thinking Iron Grasp, Discordance, Agitation, and Sloppy Butcher. He was running Bloody Coil and Rusty Jaws.
---
Using Drivers Licence and Derailed Routine doesnt make you bad just makes survivors work for the reveal.
---
Any  cooldown add ons are helpful and thats it
---
You're just a whiny old coot
---
You filled in her hair and shaved the ends of her eyebrows. Not a noticeable difference at all.
---
Swing in from the left or right, and quickly jerk the left stick to the opposite side, going back and forth very fast just above the bottom of the joystick rim
---
They said on the forums they weren't going to enable them until Mid-chapter. Did they change their minds?
---
I can certainly try, but this happened to be an assignment I was doing, and I don't have time to write creatively.
---
Play normally but don't last hook anyone
---
It only works for pallets and not any other stuns. Shame but I kinda see why they had to do it.
---
You are part of the problem with this game, and why game health continues to suffer.   Why focus on things that actually make the game work better when people are like you are standing around yelling "Shut up and take my money".
---
Either I‚Äôm dumb, or it doesn‚Äôt work?
---
Also, rip, downvote train has arrived. Wanna DM?
---
Jesus Christ how many of these awful memes are you going to post
---
swf has become cancer now, if you're having friends who don't play this game that much... rank 4/6/18/18 vs rank 2... gg
---
Love that you took everything I said and fixed it. I do believe that swf would bully him a ton.
---
It's a console players choice if Behaviour isn't stupid and puts the option there. If you say the only thing you have better than us is fps, then you clearly never even saw DBD console gameplay. Let alone play this Hell of lag.
---
Well that sucks, I‚Äôve never heard of anyone saying Enduring should be nerfed. Kind‚Äôve random that they choose to do so now.
---
I honestly don't know and I don't blame you if they're awful
---
Well demogorgon is half sci-if and half horror so why not add xenomorph
---
What perk is it?
---
It's almost like they've been creating cosmetics for a while, and run into less issues with them since they're all the same process and the people creating them could practically do it blindfolded. As opposed to attempting to change an entire infrastructure that the game was built on. 
---
So strange that these things don't take the exact same amount of time.
---
If I could just have 2 photos side by side of survivors tbagging at the exit gates, I can say "same"
---
If he saw billy coming, he could have left the door just before getting chainsawed, and then get back on it while billy is in cool down and get out.
---
1 dc -&gt; play normally
---
2 or more dcs -&gt; if there is 5 gens left, then I let the rest live.
---
My PC can run AAA games at 1080p, 80FPS, Near Max settings with 64 players.
---
To get a locked 60FPS on DBD I have to play on medium. Some maps I can play on maxed. But i'd be work to switch back and forth. Feels bad man.
---
This doesn‚Äôt make sense. Yeah there are 16 killers but in high rank you will face her a LOT. That‚Äôs like saying don‚Äôt get in a locker to counter BBQ because only 1 of 50+ perks. Certain killers and perks are used way more so it is smart to plan around them.
---
Cross your fingers.
---
Huntress has quite a few maps where she is booty.
---
I'd like the headless horsemen from sleepy hollow
---
They dont want to add a flying killer, and the movies were created by a convicted pedophile.
---
Demo for portals... maybe? Michael is the most fun non IS character. But spirit is best overall imo
---
That's because survivor's play sweaty at those ranks. Anyone who plays a killer like clown or wraith is going to get dunked on at red ranks no matter what. It's like making the argument that every survivor plays with DS, borrowed time, and adrenaline at red ranks. Of course they do, they would lose to these killers without them.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Sure.
---
Unbreakable
---
It would, it‚Äôd either be an opt out system or input based.
---
Input based Matchmaking.
---
That is a shame.
---
It was really funny.
---
I relate to this on a deep emotional level
---
It‚Äôd be input based, you would only get paired with PC players if you were grouping up with friends on PC, or if you opted in for all-platform Matchmaking.
---
yeah makes killers want to tunnel them cause why wouldnt they, they go down in one hit
---
Input based Matchmaking would be implemented with crossplay.
---
I just kept crawling, and it kept on working!
---
Demogorgon isnt in outer-space though.. its from the Earth. Xenomorph is an Alien that is from another planet. I'd be more in favor of keeping the killers to the origin of Earth IMO.

Yes, we would, at least i would think.  I mean we have leatherface and Billy, legion and ghost face, it would be something similar to that.  But even if that's not enough, a shapeshifting, fear-eating, extraterrestrial clown is a lot different than a fat man who throws bottles in a clown costume
---
Upon hooking a survivor, read auras across the whole map. -Sacrifices 2 perk slots- Looks like a lot of fun to me. :)
---
Unless that's implemented flawlessly, it could cause more harm than good with queue times. Example, when Smite implemented their PC/Console crossplay, if you chose to turn cross play off it would take upwards of 20 minutes to find a match. If BHVR does decide to do this I'd prefer if they took their time with it
---
No, wraith even without addons is very fast whens he‚Äôs cloaked
---
Fast turning is with the perks and add ons right?
---
&gt; Moonwalking. LITERALLY impossible on console as a survivor. This is due to the analog sticks being physically incapable of inputting multiple countering directions. It‚Äôs not harder, it‚Äôs IMPOSSIBLE. But that‚Äôs not too big is it?
---
Well, it is possible. I can moonwalk with a controller short distances and I've seen people go pretty far. It's quote difficult and you need to waste a lot of time to learn it, though.
---
I also have no clue what this has to do with cross play
---
Yeah it was the console icon before we actually got Bill.
---
Maybe leatherface for bbq, it's a s tier perk and good for farming bp.
---
Also ghostface and myers are pretty fun.
---
Outstanding move!
---
Thanks for the useful answer.
---
Which console?

You'd like Freddy. I played Hag most before he came out.
---
The offerings tooltip got changed already so it looks like its going to be special gens and hooks again
---
&gt; Either I‚Äôm dumb, or it doesn‚Äôt work?
---
It's just hard.
---
Yo who dis dude
---
I don‚Äôt mind tho he chillin
---
If the day you dont play on happens to be the 12th of that month then yeah you can derank
---
Yup
---
Might make Distortion more meta and increasing survivor use of lockers to block auras might make Iron Maiden useful also.
---
Did you even play this game over the past year? The amount of QoL changes have increased 1000% compared to recent years.   
---
Killers have been reworked, survivor perks have been reworked, Dedicated servers have been through two different testing phases, there was a major engine update, matchmaking has gone through 2 or 3 new iterations, there have been multiple changes to scoring including different ways to earn bloodpoints, they've changed things and reverted them after negative feedback, and have communicated exactly what is going on with the state of the game and what they are working on.
---
Everything I mentioned above was done in free updates, and worked on tirelessly by the devs that 'don't give a flying fuck about the state of the game' with the only goal in mind to make the game better. But go off.
---
So if I understand this correctly, while sane, cleaving a survivor will make you insane and take them down one health state. Cleaving a survivor while insane will put them into dying state. 
---
If that is the case, then Dark Devotion and Play with your food would be quite fun on him. Cleave a regular survivor, then cleave your obsession with full PWYF stacks. You then have 125% movement and no terror radius. You can hopefully cleave the injured survivor to go insane and cleave a third survivor. Ideally this would get you 3 hooks
---
Yh but I found it was a bug for the switch version
---
They should really add the ability to turn off aim assist in the options
---
PS4
---
They probably think they‚Äôll be able to wiggle out before you can get them to a hook
---
I really enjoy playing pig but her map pressure is terrible and the traps are basically a joke most matches. Some survivor called Pig "OP as hell"  today and shit talked in the end game. I have to wonder what goes on inside their minds...
---
I don't get it. I never played against Plague, so what's happening?
---
Yep. All I want is less popular perks to become more meta.
---
When it happens to me I still get a safety.
---
&gt;Moonwalking. LITERALLY impossible on console as a survivor. 
---
It is possible, although it is harder to do on controller than it is keyboard. But moonwalking is something people do to meme, why would anyone care about moonwalking in a chase? That's all that matters.
---
&gt;Performance. PC can perform way better, and has nigh infinite sensitivity,
---
Console performance is slowly getting to a consistent 60 fps, there will be a point where this doesn't matter. Snsitivity wise, the only killers who really suffer from aiming is nurse and huntress, the rest can deal with survivors just fine. Precision as survivor doesn't matter unless you're using a flashlight, but youd have to be bad at aiming a flashlight if you can't land a blind on a killer with a controller. Huntress and nurse being stronger to a console player doesn't mean anything, they'd just need to adapt. You already see less of those two killers on console in the first place on console. 
---
&gt;Quality. PC players can lose quality to see the red stain through walls
---
I actually have no idea what you mean by this. You can see the red stain through walls on both console and pc if the killer isn't hiding it properly. The red stain has never been an issue for me on any of those platform.
---
&gt;Hacking
---
Probably one of the only valid points, but even then, going against a hacker on pc is already pretty low (I don't know if I've ever been against a hacker, questionable lag for sure, but not an obvious hacker). Console players would have to deal with the very slim chance of going against a hacker if pc and console could go together, and that's probably worth it (I mean, matches would happen much quicker, which would definitely be worth the trade).
---
&gt;SEVERAL inherent advantages
---
I just don't see it. At most, keyboard and mouse survivors are able to 360 much better than console survivors can, and pc killers counter 360s much better than console killers do. That's the only advantage I see, but there are already ways to land hits against those type of survivors, thatd just be a case where bad killers and survivors would whine on console and good killers  and survivors would easily be able to adapt.
---
Please add cross play
---
Instead of nerfing Billy's basekit, buff Demodoggo
---
Billy needs a couple add-on reworks, but his basekit ability is fine as is
---
Inaccurate. Claudettes don‚Äôt get in chases. They crouch by hook and disappear when they unhook you.
---
She looks ugly with makeup on, her new beanie head is sick without the make-up
---
removing the aim assist is a buff
---
if they added the mystery crew as survivor's I would literally main survivor and play as Shaggy all day long
---
how about removing aim assist everywhere? Its really annoying
---
CAN SURVIVORS STOP MESSAGING ME AFTER THE GAME AFTER PLAYING ON HADDONFIELD AND SAYING ‚ÄúWOW YOU COULDNT GET ONE KILL WITH ONE OF THE BEST BUILDS ON (INSERT KILLER HERE)‚Äù. ALSO NO ONE GIVES A SHIT WHAT RANK YOU ARE, IT MEANS ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING.
---
Back in the day hooks were far from the corner. So if you got them there it was a free DS basically.
---
I‚Äôd love a better variety of perks that are actually worth running other than in gimmick builds.
---
&gt; I actually have no idea what you mean by this. You can see the red stain through walls on both console and pc if the killer isn't hiding it properly. The red stain has never been an issue for me on any of those platform.
---
No, PC players can set it to low quality settings and the red stain goes through literally everything all the time. It is completely different than console
---
Yeah I don't play that often because I hate how toxic everyone is. I played a lot during the blood hunt to unlock balanced landing and level up Kate. She's in the high 30s now and it'll take me awhile to get to 50. But when I do, I wanted to figure out if it was worth doing it. I don't think I will.
---
We actually do need a killer that moves faster than normal, but with long cooldown and a lack of teleport. Stronger than nurse, but with a huge skill ceiling. 
---
It will balance out the bell curve of killers, which centers on A/B tier, and has a full curve down to D tier, but the curve is lacking above Nurse/Spirit.
---
i mean its an ultra rare, those tend to be the game changer addons for most killers.
---
For killer, it used to be all you had to do was kill/sacrifice all 4 people. But they changed it.
---
They should make survivor ones more even in difficulty, by having a certain amount of time working on generators too.
---
There was a time when getting to the hook wasn‚Äôt guaranteed because of sabo...also there are occasions when they will be able to wiggle free because of a weird map layout or the closest hook is already broken from killing someone else, but that‚Äôs rare.
---
I think that's fine. Sounds about as balances as Tier I Michael Meyers sneaking up on you. First hit is basically free.
---
that looks like handsome jack with his mask
---
It's the same
---
I can't unsee it now....
---
Needs to be taken in front of a dirty bathroom mirror with a sparkle filter added.
---
They said early October, if they had released it already im prety sure they would have reworded it to something like "starting today".
---
Its because shes the only killer besides nurse who can control the match no matter what kind of survivors they go against
---
Unless they've changed it since release, someone did like 600 amanda traps and found that half of them get removed with the first box, a quarter with the next box, and so on.
---
The results heavily indicated that each time a box is checked, it's 50/50.
---
Enduring made the new ds pointless and since pretty much any m1 killer runs this perk it was pretty rediciulous. I will try to find a clip.
---
Play killer right now.
---
I think theres a server issue going on. I'm on ps4 and since dedicated servers went live on PC hours ago the game has been unplayable.
---
I set it to low settings cause that's how I get 60 fps. Yeah, it is slightly more visible on low settings, but I don't think it really effects the red stain as much as you're thinking it does. If there is an advantage, I feel that it is miniscule at most. However, lets say it does. Even if it did effect it quite a bit, console survivors are already used to it. This wouldn't matter to them, because the red stain doesn't effect the killer anyway. On average I guess pc survivors would perform slightly better than console survivors, but overall it wouldn't matter, maybe console killers would need to slightly adjust their positioning when moonwalking to account for the slightly easier red stain. It's still hardly an advantage pc survivors would have over a console survivor.
---
As a Nurse main who *loves* the Legacy skins, i wish i had started playing when i first saw the game. I'd have that pretty cheetos dust on my Sally :(
---
&gt; Acceptable to you does not equal acceptable to anyone else, nor is it acceptable to the health of the killer. She's not suppose to be your plaything, she's suppose to be a serious threat.
---
So you think an acceptable level of strength is when a good nurse player can 4k literally every single game with her base kit?  I'm not saying that she should be nerfed beyond recognition, I want them to nerf her to a level where she is actually balanced.
---
&gt; GTHOH with that suggestion. Base Nurse is perfectly fine and is highly skillful. A great Nurse requires more skill than all survivors mechanics combined. More skillful mechanics is needed for survivors, not even more skill for killers.
---
It's not like I'm suggesting that they make her require less skill. I'm simply suggesting that they nerf her power. It's not a coincidence that literally every content creator for this game puts The Nurse in S+ tier above every other killer in the game. She is literally so strong that if you know how to play her well you will never ever lose a game with her.
---
Probably one of the more gruesome ones.
---
And vice versa, why the survivor shroud that starts all survivors together is terrible.  It's like, okay, we're all together, so of we all start this gen, the killer *will come here*.
---
Honestly, they should be switched, so the killer can make survivors start together and the survivors can make everyone start alone.
---
Tier 1 michael is slow. Just pay attention. This killer is faster than any other killer in the game.
---
mmmm tasty
---
I don't get it. What am I missing?
---
Again, I don't think it's that big of a deal, but the difference is quite substantial. When I watch boyo or edgar play, it blows my mind how much more the stain penetrates than on console
---
12 to a 7,8,7, and 10 eek
---
Wait till u get a 9 to a 2,2,4,8 ü§£
---
same here &amp; I even watch old videos of nurse game | play :(
---
Nimbusette?
---
They de-rank us every month.
---
Personally I think it‚Äôs a huge waste of time to derank.
---
Exactly. This is a fair game, at least by DbD standards
---
True, maybe a noise when he's running in your direction would work?
---
I also don't think "fast" really even applies to Jack Torrance either so that's a whole other issue.
---
Pig needs some TLC
---
Yes i did those
---
He reposted this with balance changes.
---
I don't like it. Auto-blink is just stupid. At least with five blinks you still need to actually know where/how to aim and charge the blinks :/ 
---
*(Just a comparison between rares, i don't think she should have extra blinks)*
---
Sven ate Seven
---
What a surprise, no mention of the new elephant in the fog, PS4 crossplay. As of today crossplay is available on every platform this game is on and BHVR has been tinkering with dedicated servers all year. But why would they be smart enough to connect those dots and increase the player pool. Thats time spent making your game better. Instead they spend time (and a lot of money) securing licensed IP and creating themed cosmetics that are completely disconnected from the tone of their game. The real torture is the matchmaking times the real nightmare is the lopsided player levels you matchmake with.
---
I know it used to be only the kills. I wish they'd revert it. Making Survivor ones more difficult isn't really helpful either.
---
"Win" as Survivor or Killer with only their 3 perks should be the only requirement.
---
I saw the post on the official forums. They are running tests today on PC. 
---
[https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92394/why-are-dedicated-servers-online](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92394/why-are-dedicated-servers-online)
---
Servers everywhere are slow recently.
---
Just hear me out
---
Few more years and they're bound to release a Hallowed Blight skin on her right? :D 'til then i'll be rocking her black sleeved/dark recoloured dress which shows the glow of her blinks extra brightly :P
---
I'm sorry but this is a perfect example of why killers don't like ds lasting as long as it does, it's clear that he wasn't tunneling you at this point and it basically gave you the escape for next to free.
---
I‚Äôm just like you where I‚Äôm coming back from a long hiatus but the game still favors survivors heavily more than killers. NOED while annoying at times isn‚Äôt that bad. Best way to counter it is to do bones while looking for ruin or if your using inner strength. Most killer who run NOED are probably using it if they want BP (dailies for example), practice using a hard killer (like nurse), or have a meme build centered around it. 
---
Now survivors on the other hand have more annoying perks than NOED. Most notable ~~the virgin perk~~ decisive strength and adrenaline. One grants you a free get away and the latter a free heal plus a sprint burst. Not to mention Dead hard and Borrowed time are meta but these two can be countered by using your head. The good thing is that Self care got HEAVILY nerfed so it‚Äôs better to run a med-kit instead. Even the worse survivors have an advantage because they can work on gens while the pros distract killer. 
---
Overall I‚Äôd suggest to not take the game seriously and have fun. Personally I don‚Äôt like running meta perks (half because I don‚Äôt have them unlocked) but have fun trying new builds and take multiple breaks if your having trouble. At the end you might end up like me...a killer main...because survivor is boring lol
---
Idk which one is more horrifying
---
GIME ME FCKNG LV3 BALANCE LANDING
---
Last match I got booted off of post game chat as killer with a "Host disconnected" message after a bit. AFAIK when they were testing servers on the PTB, Post Game Chat would auto-kick everyone after a bit of time.
---
right :)
---
You agree with me? What are you saying?
---
I've been playing all day with no issues.
---
DOWNSIDE ON THE OPPOSITE END, IS OUR LOBBY TIMES ARE BULLSHIT FOR HOW LONG THEY CAN BE. AND BEING AGAINST A TEAM OF DICKISH SWF IS SUPER SUPER ANNOYING.
---
Doesn‚Äôt always work for them, I‚Äôve had a survivor sprint burst out of a bear trap into another one three times in a row
---
Yeah this wouldn't be anywhere near as much of an issue if there was an unranked mode. I wanna be able to play with my friends who are new to the game in a more relaxed environment without dumping them in the deep end with high ranked killers.
---
Totems out in the open is not a thing in the majority of maps, which means totem spawns have been fixed / are being fixed. 
---
* Totems spawning in the middle of nowhere doesn't happen on:
---
4 MacMilan Maps (not sure about Shelter Woods). 
---
Wreckers Yard and Gas Heaven (not sure about the other 3 Autoheaven map).
---
Father's Campbell I am 80% it doesn't happen. 
---
Haddonfield. 
---
Grim Pantry and Pale Rose
---
Lery's, The Game and Laboratory. 
---
Mother's Dwelling and Temple. 
---
Doesn't happen in any of the variations of preschool (5 maps). 
---
Yamaoka. 
---
* It does occur on:
---
any corn map (5 maps).
---
Disturbed Ward.
---
Ormond. 
---
So 7 maps against 21 (plus 4 maps that I am not sure).
---
Lol dude I'm sorry but this was a massive game changing change to an entire killer from the ground up and it's 6 months old.  This sub has a huge problem with people providing terrible advice on subjects they literally know nothing about as evidenced by you to impressionable gamers genuinely looking for help on here.  It has nothing to do with being a "keyboard correction officer" and everything to do with preventing you from causing new players learning the game to get their asses kicked in game following your advice born of ignorance.  You really shouldn't be getting this defensive about it man.  You were wrong. I corrected you to keep you from tanking their Legion games.  It doesn't have to be a fight and it shouldn't because you don't have a leg to stand on here.
---
I've seen way worse. This actually seems pretty balanced
---
See shit like this this never happens to me when I play David. I will not ever play him again because I always die first when I play him like the killer is always next to me and always tunnels me
---
I THINK THATS THE MAIN ISSUE WITH THIS COMMUNITY, SINCE IT'S DESIGNED TO BE 4V1 YOU START TO THINK ALONG THE LINES OF YOUR "TEAM" AND BOTH SIDES HAVE ISSUES THEY HAVE TO FACE FROM THE OTHER SIDE THAT CAN BE SUPER ENRAGING!!
---
Thanatophobia, sloppy and dying light on legion is pretty fun and works well if you can end chases early and keep up the wounds.
---
So you‚Äôre saying you killed 2 people yet you somehow got a black pip?
---
Shirtless David, Leopard print Ace with goggles, biker Kate
---
Santa Clown and Singlet Trapper with metal bucket head.
---
Stolen Sketchbook + Cold Dirt or Susie‚Äôs Mixtape.
---
Cleanse and hide from her. Get to the other side of the map, stay in a jungle gym, move between lockers.
---
Awww nuts
---
A rank system is better than no rank system.  A rank 20 killer experience wise shouldn't be matched against rank 1 survivors and vice versa.  The system isn't perfect but it's more balanced than none at all for matchmaking purposes.
---
Billy is dieing out actually. There are a ton of demigorgons right now
---
ü§î
---
Well if you can't end loops without an ability than you're probably a low rank. And if you're really worried about them staying injured then run Thanatophobia or Stridor. Easily fixes that problem.
---
Funny.
---
Proceeds to bang it with a stick.
---
Hey, didn't mean I wouldn't try.
---
&gt;entititty
---
That's not the point. Dedicated Servers are up right now, whether you've noticed or not.
---
Yeah I play in purple ranks when ranks reset and I need to climb to rank 1 again.
---
Idk I definitely get corrupted Dryad from Hag. I can see what you're talking about though. Wraith looks a lot like the woodland spirit from Witcher now that I think of it.
---
That is not aim assist thats the turning ability at the first part of the saw as it starts you can turn sharply to catch people off guard.
---
Honestly if your perks not in the shrine for 4 weeks you'll probably have enough shards to just buy the owner of the perks assuming they aren't licensed
---
no 4k = baby killer
---
/s
---
And the survivor for this chapter could be Wendy!
---
Check the second picture OP posted showing post-game chat.
---
This is pretty good shitpost lol
---
How on earth did you get fucked by so many downvotes
---
If you know how to play her she is basically a better huntress. Can be very powerful if you know how to end
---
Always!
---
Wow that is an unholy looking skin
---
First the belly jiggle, now the taunt.
---
Why do they keep nerfing my boi?
---
Bruh so much built up anger. Did mommy not love you?
---
Rank 1 players continued to pip at red ranks so they‚Äôre going to be better than a brand new red rank that still needs to learn how the games go
---
You'll fit right in.
---
Would be amazing as an option. As someone who started this game on console and switched to PC it would be great. I have friends I can't play with anymore but would be willing to opt into cross-play.
---
This isn‚Äôt even that bad. None of them were even using items
---
The lesson here is that the demogorgon has very thick skin that cant be penetrated, but brute force impacts still hurt it.
---
Yeah, gotta slow them gens down just a little bit.
---
Surprised the gene didn‚Äôt DC
---
Just play Nurse
---
i locked this thread for breaking the rules but yes dedicated servers are up right now for pc users as a test it has been confirmed
---
Wow thank you guys, I didn‚Äôt realize so many people would like the comparison or even see it &lt;3
---
oh lol, thats dumb
---
So punching the deadly man eating monster is more effective than shooting it. Seems reasonable
---
Might want to google again. I figured this was probably fake since I'm 99% sure the top pic is from TPUSA (well-known liars) so I looked into it.
---
What Dunham actually said, although still not a very good point, was that [white men can't understand what it's like for Clinton to be under attack due to her being a woman](https://www.aol.com/video/view/lena-dunham-white-men-can-t-understand-hillary-s-struggles/570be4f3e4b0ccec1c6abca6/?guccounter=1). The "white" part seems unnecessary so idk what's up with that, but yeah TPUSA took some "creative liberties", let's call them.
---
STOP DISCONNECTING AGAINST KILLERS YOU'RE NOT 100% COMFORTABLE DEALING WITH, IT MAKES THE GAME SO MUCH HARDER AND LESS ENJOYABLE
---
How can you tell?
---
Slightly on-topic - why did they fuck up her hair in-game? It looks awful now.
---
I almost never see people purposefully not clean themselves let alone an entire team. Plus if you know how to end loops it won't matter.
---
Hex: Wraith Totem
---
Not objectively lol, it's a hardware related fact
---
ah okay
---
Same. Even if it was just between consoles because some people are scared of PC survivors of killers. I'm surprised some people are against it because of queue times.
---

Thank god plaid flannel is getting changed to common, might actually attempt to play nurse more now
---
No she loves me just fine and this developer has just really pissed me off with the incompetence and lack of management, I‚Äôve seen this before, just fed up with the bs excuses, then people like asshole above coming in to keep making excuses for them! 
---
This player base should hold their feet to the fire every now and then! 
---
I bet you $1000 that they pulled extra resources to get that stupid switch game and servers up and going, so they could keep the deadline! But DLC &amp; cosmetics get top priority, even if it breaks the game...
---
Can we buff 70% of the survivor perks wich are practically useless?
---
You said in another comment that she's basically a better Huntress which indicates to me that you have no clue what you're talking about and do not play killer.
---
So I'm only going to address one thing in your comment:
---
&gt; Well if you can't end loops without an ability than you're probably a low rank.
---
It's more a matter of high tier killers versus low tier killers; the ability in various circumstances to end a chase quickly. What I quoted you saying *only* applies to loops that can be mindgamed.
---
Killers who cannot end loops that can be mindgamed to get a hit are probably low rank, yes.
---
But for loops that **cannot** be mindgamed, ending the loop is really up to the survivor. The killer only "ends" it by running around until the survivor *has* to throw the pallet. 
---
Huntress has the ability, freely, to play around these kind of loops to get downs unlike Plague
---
And I'm going to address one more thing, actually:
---
&gt; And if you're really worried about them staying injured then run Thanatophobia
---
if you're a survivor who cleanses because of Thana, you're probably low rank. I don't play low rank, so survivor I play against do not give a shit about Thana
---
Yeah, I get that.  Doesnt change she's a cunt.  Maybe read some of her other quotes and stupidity. 
---
Just not a good person, honestly.
---
I mean I'm probably one of the fairest killers to play this game.
---
I hardly camp and I'll very rarely tunnel. So if I'm being toxic to someone else they definitely did something to deserve it
---
I thought it was an anti-tunnel perk, not a "stand still and get willingly downed" perk...
---
Salute to Megs!
---
it wouldn‚Äôt be too surprising given the remastered version of the movie just came out and a sequel is going to come out soon.
---
And if you haven't guessed it: Its Noed.
---
Pre-Bill Unbreakable looks like it could work well for another perk
---
Killer FOV is also shit when falling, you can't see right underneath you.
---
Are you serious or just missing the shitpost tag?
---
Trapper can't run through his own traps unless he just placed them and is still standing on them.

thank god, btw do you have a picture or source for that info? i believe you but just wanna see it myself

Yeah I know the two girls have different animations to the guys in terms of running but their isles are the same across the board. I know it‚Äôs not a huge thing but it bugs meüòÇ

As long as you got up there knowing how to handle yourself in a chase you'll be fine.  But if you got up there through immersion and altruism you and your teamates are in for a rough time.
---
BUT THATS ON YOU, IF SOMEBODY IS LOOPING YOU WHILE MULTIPLE GENS ARE POPPING JUST SWITCH TARGETS. IT‚ÄôS THE SURVIVORS JOB TO SURVIVE, IT‚ÄôS THE KILLERS JOB TO KILL.
---
lol Nurse is still going to be insanely broken
---
&gt;All your doing is inspiring toxic killers.
---
This.
---
Couldn't really be Danny unless it was Doctor Sleep Danny.  We don't have any gingers in the game, and his Shining abilities could be cool to mess with.
---
Totem defense killers are obnoxious to play against. All devs have to do is prevent open field spawns, gen spawns, and killer shack spawns. Instead, they decided to keep these absurdly weak spawns and also begin introducing exceptionally strong spawns.
---
Had they kept the current spawn types, but prevented the Hex from appearing in those three instances, it would have been very well balanced, but now we're heading in this absurd direction where it's either impossible to find it or way, way too easy
---
are you okay? it is balanced

what do you mean? it‚Äôs toootally appropriate to put young children in a game about killing
---
FOR EVERY BULLSHIT PERK OR POWER KILLERS GET THERE'S ONE OR MAYBE EVEN TWO BULLSHIT PERKS OR ITEMS SURVIVORS GET.

THAT'S NOT EVEN MENTIONING HOW SWF IS ESSENTIALLY BOND AND MAYBE KINDRED WITHOUT TAKING UP A PERK SLOT AND ALLOWS EVEN GREATER COMMUNICATION.

WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR AND THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENS, I TEABAG TO SAY THANK YOU

Its annoying... it needs to be reported and fixed.

---
I do like it, it's about time nurse had addons that werent all very boring addons that slightly adjusted her power.
---
No one should downvote because its true. It's a game and will not effect you if you die in one trial. I play both sides and it annoys me to see noed as survivor BUT it's a viable win.
---
You know i posted this over 4 months ago? Could be that the game changed, but the last time i played you only got matched up with bots

FUCK THE FUCKING GENRUSH AT HIGH FUCKING RANKS, ALSO TIRED OF HAVING TO ALWAYS GO WITH SWF CUNTS THAT GET ME SUPER SALT AND ALMOST MAKE ME BREAK MY DAMN 100‚Ç¨ KEYBOARD. FUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I like the double pip requirement because it means you can't cheese your way though it with moris, camps or forced slugs like you used to be able to.  I agree survivor side is way too easy though.  I think they should just keep things the way they are but also require survivors to doublepip as well for the sake of fairness.  Make these trophies actually feel like accomplishments for both sides.
---
That Billy was smart af
---
Well, okay. But Legion has experience fighting. That goes a long way.
---
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
---
That head on the feng tho
---
Bruh, i was wondering why you had -3 upvotes, then yoy started with slow gens and then nerf nurse and ruin.
---
Omega ooouf. 
---
I still upvoted for the voicelines for characters tho
---
Tbh I just teabag as GF for fun. Even more fun when the survivors join in
---
Unreal engine crash reporter, they just renamed it.
---
I think this one is supposed to help players inexperienced with the Nurse, because if there is people that mastered control of Nurse, there is others which do horrible with her.
---
That explains the Plaid Flannel change as well, which is common now (from Very Rare) and shows the blink indicator at all times.
---
Depends on what is worth for you.
---
He is fun to play and he talks.
---
Do you necessary need his perks to win ? No.
---
So I don't know what is worth for you.
---
"BuT Ds Is FiNe NoW!"
---
If you like evil dead then yes. If your only thinking of the perks then no
---
EVERYONE COMPLAINS ABOUT ONLY PLAYING AGAINST NURSE, BILLY AND SPIRIT BUT THEN BULLY ANY OTHER KILLER RELENTLESSLY AT ANY RANK ABOVE 7 BY TEABAGGING AND FLASHLIGHT CLICKING AND THEN WONDER WHY THEY ONLY GET MATCHED WITH OMEGABLINKS AND PRAYER BEADS AND NOBODY WANTS TO TRY OUT OTHER BUILDS.
---
GETTING SANDBAGGED PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH. I WILL LEAVE YOU ON THE HOOK IF YOU DO THAT TO ME.
---
If it's primarily happening late game it could be them just trying to buy as much time as possible for teamates to repair the crunch time gens while you take the killer as far as humanly possible away from them.  This is only a worthwhile idea if you know you can't continue extending the chase naturally due to a bad area or something.
---
"OMG David NO!" 
---
For the darkmode users who couldnt read the third box
---
I play since release and have 5k hours so you are right. (:
---
Also you are right, I was talking about the moment when the trapper just placed down his trap. Maybe my post wasnt clear enough due to my bad english.
---
Jesus christ that is scary. Gonna have to start wearing diapers playing just in case
---
You are so wrong, its still a really good perk to reduce chase time and at high ranks survivors will figure out that you have spirit fury and they will end up dropping pallets early and you will not use two of your perks
---
&gt;  expand your friend group
---
lol
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of mastering billy! The curves take a lot of practice and make up for his fixed turn.
---
Experience fighting? Where did you hear that? They killed a janitor who grabbed Julie while they were vandalizing a convenient store. They have no fighting skills, especially against a 9 foot tall monster. Plus, they have nowhere NEAR the fire power Steve, Nancy, and Jonothan had in that episode
---
Keyboard and mouse being faster because of hardware is an objective statement.  So yeah, it is objectively.
---
Considering he can use his power successfully *every time* he uses it, I agree.
---
Yeah pretty much, I played way more than normal since the lastest chapter and got myself into red ranks with ghostface. 
---
Oh god what a mistake it was, it's full on swf with more toolboxes, insta meds and flashlight I've ever seen on my life. Also, lots of salty ttv dudes. I don't blame them but it isn't even fun to play that way for me, I can still win but it's annoying as shit and you gotta try-hard to do so.
---
At this point I'll just wait for the rank reset, while playing some survivor which are still on the green ranks thankfully.
---
... are you joking, you are probably a trash killer main who uses ruin and noed then complains about decent survivor like decisive, decisive was needed to shit and it‚Äôs actually pretty bad now.

"All work and no play" or typewriter clicking?
---
Positive aspects: only survivor who talks, one or the few licensed survivors that look like the real actor, original skins (his hand instead of his head).
---
Negative aspects: useless perks, very big and loud
---
Your english is great. I could tell exactly what you meant. I don't know why everyone else had such an issue
---
Surveillance or Discordance would be useful to know which generators are working on so you can teleport nearby.
---
Are there any good keyboard/mouse peripherals for PS4?  Because I'm feeling very attacked right now.
---
Save the best for last is pretty decent on demo, since you can just use your power and the obsession without loosing stacks. Other than that Enduring is always a good option. Also Pop goes the weasel could pe good, when you use it and your portals correctly.
---
Noed isnt really needed on demo if you learned how to play him, he is stron enough to kill the survivors anyways.
---
I thought this would be about deliverance
---
I was wrong
---
Killer really should have saw that coming
---
That‚Äôs been a thing, yeah
---
Claiming survivors have perks more annoying than NOED is silly.  There isn't a worse designed perk currently left in the game post Decisive and MoM rework than NOED at present.  
---
Decisive a (virgin perk).  You are aware it was reworked to punish babykillers who camp hooks and hard tunnel off them correct?  Decisive is only an issue for bad killers.  If it's a problem for you consistently you need to take a long hard look at your killer playstyle because that perk is balanced.  The only time I eat d strikes is when I want to swap obsessions to help out my STBFL perk.
---
I DON'T GET WHY SURVIVORS WHINE ABOUT TUNNELING CAMPING ETC WHEN WE HAVE TO EAT DSTRIKES, INSTA HEALS, RNG UNHOOKS, BODYBLOCKING ETC. IF ANYTHING WE HAVE IT FAR WORSE, I ALSO DISLIKE HOW PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT NURSE AND SPIRIT!!!
---
Thx. Are surveillance and discordance unlockable from the start or are they teachable (if so what killers)
---
Reread the poooooost
---
happened to me during the blood hunt
---
man mori‚Äôd me in the second game lol
---
You have a point. Just had a game where I was the last Survivor. One door was open, the other was just around the corner. He had Noed up and I knew there was no chance or surviving. At this point Noed shouldn't be active anymore. Maybe give Noed a timer for how long it is active after the doors are open.
---
Its literally just a way to get another one or two pity kills. There is no skill in using it. Yeah, you play the game with 3 perks until the doors are open, but if that is your excuse, then just play another perk and show your worth. Just don't rely on Noed to get a pity kill.
---
Ruin is another thing, but you can work around that. The combination of Ruin and Noed on the other hand is not fun. Especially if you play through all 5 gens while Ruin is active just to see Noed at the end. Urghs.
---
You can turn him, but there's a noticeable "snap" when you land the blow.
---
I was a rank 3 killer before I took a break from the game. The Plauge can injure people from a distance and with corrupt purge you can easily hit multiple survivors and get a double hit if you're lucky.  
---
As for the loops, yes some of them can't be mindgamed and yes huntress is better in those situations but in all of the others that can be mindgamed you easy break them and down them.  
---
As for the Thana if you want to take the 16% action speed penalty then go ahead. But it's normally comboed with other perks that help to decrease action speed making it much harder to complete gens if the killer is good at patrolling gens.
---
It just doesn‚Äôt feel worth it imo. Oh wow i can eat pallets 50% quicker. Just dont get stunned. Its a waste of a slot compared to the 75% and it affecting ds and head on. Now it feels meh. Whats the point out of all the other perks? Its not bad its just not amazing. Brutal strength or bamboozle are better
---
Not exactly. All Behavior needs to do is increase the sensitivity for controllers on console, then I could see it being fair.
---
The first pallet is an easy down, the trapper is a huge potatoe. Problably a new guy
---
Thx. What killer is save the best for last teachable on (if it‚Äôs a teachable perk)
---
If you are on the other side of the wall she just blinks over and then blinks on top of you. She doesn't have to predict you and the double back only works on bad nurses. Unless you bring dead hard and iron will you are gonna have a bad time against a good nurse.
---
This isn't that. At the right distance, Hillbilly will turn without input to connect the saw with the Survivor.
---
I think GF looks too funny when he is t-bagging to get mad at it :P
---
you get crows if you dont move for a while, you dont HAVE to be in the dying state to get them
---
Doesn't shred instadown if you're exposed?
---
#Suffer
---
The hatch was essentially impossible to balance equally so they shifted it from being extremely survivor-sided to mostly killer-sided and honestly if it has to favor one side vs. the other it probably does feel a little more fair this way vs. The shitshow that was the hatch standoff mechanic.  
---
Overall the game has become much more balanced for killer over the past year of updates.  They have the edge against soloqueue for sure and against weak to middling swf teams, but a depip squad level 4 man is still the power role.  Not impossible to beat mind you but definitely heavily advantaged.
---
I honestly feel 95% of Survivors aren't good enough in a chase to justify this.
---
There isn't anything objective about that. It's a fact, PC hardware has faster ms response times/less input lag and better accuracy due to it being per dot rather than analog.
---
I know you get afk crows I just never got them while dying, I assumed it didn‚Äôt have any to give you a chance to crawl and hide
---
IF IT GLOWS IT GOES
---
Bing Bong Boy also needs some love :(
---
Make Your Choice, Spirit Fury/Enduring, Surveillance, Discord, Pop Goes The Weasel (Surge is a decent enough alternative) and Bamboozle all work pretty great on him
---
That's cute
---
Why wake up?
---
Discordance is amazing in my opinion and it's a legion perk
---
As ghost face today I had the same problem I ran around abit and soon it fixed itself gotta 4k on that game thankfully
---
They‚Äôre all pretty good, but I would change You Wouldn‚Äôt Even Know so that it does the same thing, but with hooked survivors instead of downed survivors, that just seems better to me, but you‚Äôve definitely thought about your perks more than I have lol
---
&gt;Red ranks with Ghostface
---
Damn, that's an accomplishment if I've ever seen one
---
Incorrect, I want to remove the minor flick you get with a close range saw.
---
Thx.
---
They're Pig and Legion perks, respectively.  You'll need to level the killers or buy it from the Shrine.
---
I love this format
---
Camping the hook is okay?
---
All he had to do was break it or trap it lol
---
Go away.
---
Nope, it's always been there.
---
For April fool‚Äôs day, pumped up kicks should play in the background. 
---
I think the dev in one of the recent (month or two at best) threads mentioned that whenever the trap is put on survivor's head, he is assigned some random ID that corresponds to certain box, so there is no rng after that, only one box is always yours.
---
Yeah lmao every time a killer complain bout teabagging and justifying Face camping all I can imagine is that one neighborhood kid who ruined every game when it didn‚Äôt go his way and ran home to tell his parents on everyone cause of a little playful teasing.
---
Use a real knife you wont
---
Shrine Watch was one of the first things I started watching after starting DBD, and that led me to your other videos and subbing to your stream and still looking forward to each SW installment. Thanks for all of the work you put into these! When I was new they educated me about so many perks and now it's good ol' entertainment.
---
I want the pig to place exploding Jack-O-Lanterns on peoples heads instead of traps.

Go die in a fire. You know jack
---
I think this is a great idea op, I can finally play with friends who own different platforms, and people seem to think crossplay means it will always be active for all matchmaking, that's not the case, for example they can do selective crossplay, meaning that, you only play with other platforms if you're in a party with someone, for example, your friend plays on pc, you play on ps4, when soloing you just matchmake with ps4 players, but when you join his party you two will matchmake with pc players, and vice versa, it's literally nothing but a good thing, there are no downsides to this.
---
Just played against a pallet Freddy on Blood Lodge. What a nightmare that was. üôÑ
---
Thx. I‚Äôll do a bit of extra research and figure might playstyle a bit more and then decide using that. Thx for the suggestion though.
---
Lithe and sprint burst?ü§î
---
I‚Äôd be cool if you answered the question instead of acting like you know everything about the game.
---
The alternative is letting a rank 4 and a rank 6 smurf on a rank 12 killer.
---
If your rank 18's want to opt into a match against a rank 2, that's your choice.
---
Killers don't get to opt out of your lobbies, so they should be matched with people not significantly higher than their rank.
---
RETURN MY LOST LEGACY COSMETICS. THANKS A BUNCH.
---
Btw surveilance is in the shrine highy recomend you buy it
---
Thats actually a good point, I thought the improved regression helped balance it out (on top of the add-ons that made you do it faster) But it def could use some work.
---
I‚Äôm late to commenting but for the last 3 days me and my friend have randomly been getting kicked from match‚Äôs even though the other people stay in. I‚Äôve lost a good amount of pips, offerings, and items because of it.
---
I think the dev's should do what other games do and when a player dcs their character is still active in the game, they could leave and rejoin the same match and continue if they crash, and it also disallows people from dcing to get a different game, they're forced to play it out.
---
Thx. But I may just buy pig as I‚Äôm trying to save up for plague and legion (on switch so I already have all the other non-licensed killers)
---
Demogorgon makes me panic a lot the scariest in  a real sense is I guess legion or clown
---
I thought this was gonna be an airliner food joke
---
So heated he said the n-word.  
---
*NEA*
---
I agree with you. I should‚Äôve specified that Input based Matchmaking would be a thing before hand because people seem to REALLY be against Crossplay with PC for whatever reason. Its like you said, nothing but a good thing. Infact, DBD is probably one of the only games where PC and Console don‚Äôt necessarily have a disadvantage because they are on a controller. If they optimize the game on Console there would really be no disadvantages as I‚Äôve seen streamers using Controllers on PC as survivor and still do extremely good at looping.
---
Another video showing a baby killer. Nothing new
---
BHVR:  DID SOMEONE SAY NERF PIG?  ALSO, WHAT IS THIS LEGION YOU MENTION?
---
Micheal hands down
---
Yes, because that would solve the big problem regarding swf. Let‚Äôs not balance it, but just make 1/17 killers viable! Genius!
---
I really like this idea. I can especially appreciate that you didn‚Äôt do another disguise killer concept (I‚Äôm so sick of seeing those). The power sounds really fun, but I‚Äôd be concerned about have the last three gens all being sabotaged. Getting that last one or even two gens could be impossible. I think if you limited sabotaging to a maximum of two of the same type of object, it‚Äôd be a really fun addition to the game. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt really want to see a built in Spirit Fury on any killer, but you could
---
- Have the pallet break a fixed time after the stun (even 5 seconds would be enough)
---
- Increase stun time to adjust the spirit fury/enduring effect
---
- Change a pallet break to a hefty decrease in vault speed, making many semi-safe pallets considerably less safe
---
Those are my thoughts on the concept, it‚Äôd be kind of a refreshing addition to the game to have a killer that fucks with survivors progress instead of the other way around.
---
Was talking about something like this last night with the m8's.
---
We ran with a "Here's Johnny!" perk where breaking a pallet would expose or reveal the survivor who dropped it.
---
I hate playing both with and against hiding Claudettes. That's why I'm using pove thyself, we'll make it, borrowed time and small game as surv and restraint addon + disresssing Doc as killer
---
I like to use low tier perks
---
For some ungodly reason they changed the killer achievements so you need to double pip to get them
---
Fast track to rank 1 XD
---
That‚Äôs an Oof
---
So I‚Äôm salty and trash huh, so the fact that ds now is bad for better player who don‚Äôt get downed instantly after being unhooked I‚Äôm bad? Once again DUMBASS
---
The thing is, you may not find It difficult but you are fucking your team
---
Is almost Impossible to go for a save against a good red vomit plague, she will get both the savior and the unhooked at once(saw this happening too many times), and your team will be fucked 
---
If you are solo playing and don't care about team play? Fine go ahead and cleanse but in a long term point of view, you are screwing your team
---
posted an edited version if y‚Äôall wanna check that out
---
1. there is a fix for that in the next hotfix but unsure if it has gone live or not
---
2. you were able to gather "putrid vials" which could be used to buy very snazzy looking costumes for free
---
Oh! Surprise I guess.  Really wish they warned us before just turning these on.
---
Testing out things now to see how they fare. Hopefully better than on the previous PTB.
---
Give **Boil Over** a bonus effect of **5/10/15%** faster struggle speed and we gucci.
---
Dying light is a direct counter to all your other perks, the obsession just gets free batony knowledge, and hes the one you're ignoring so he can go around saving and healing his teammates
---
&gt; Sometimes a man just wants to saunter through the mist throwing jugs of questionable fluid
---
relatable
---
Oh ok, thanks!
---
I have reached red ranks with my Doctor for a couple of seasons now, it's certainly an experience lol.
---
Had a game earlier where the Survs played like rank 20 so my mood switched from "sweaty ready" to "let's have fun" and they dropped all the pallets even when i wasnt near them and because i was memeing and juggling three of them they managed to actually smash like three gens without me noticing 
---
And because It was too late for me to catch up three left and I killed one lonely claudette lol
---
Yeah I know but why did it randomly kick me two games in a row after the match started? 
---
These dedicated servers aren't very good yet imo
---
Well now that I look back at it I probably should have been more observant
---
Who do you think would be a good shining survivor though?
---
If you can't handle her at her Blazing Lineage, then you don't deserve her at her schoolgirl skin.
---
 Just don‚Äôt be afraid to loose them cause you will get them back eventually unless it‚Äôs a purple flashlight
---
I HAD A DEMOGORGON TODAY ATTACK AND HIT ME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WINDOW IN THE KILLER SHACK.  
---
AND JUST ONE TIME I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY *SEE* FREDDY TOUCH MY CHARACTER WHEN HE HITS ME.  AS IT IS NOW, HE JUST SLICES THE AIR NEAR ME AND I BLEED.
---
I mean it is a test for a reason lol
---
&gt; But it's not an objectively bad play. It's effective in many circumstances. Try it right after a rank reset and you'll probably get a 3k because there's a decent chance nobody's doing generators while the guy is in the hook.
---
Ye, we already had that discussion a couple posts back. It's objectively bad in the context of having competent survivors, because if you have inherently incompetent survivors, you can reliably 4k them anyways, with or without camping, making it irrelevant whether it is not an objectively bad play in that circumstance.
---
&gt; Similarly, survivors taking the game hostage until the killer DC'd was also effective a lot of the time, and is also a dick move.
---
I would prefer not to bring exploits into this discussion, because at that point you can say that lagswitching or hacking is 'effective a lot of the time and also a dick move'. Which is true, but entirely besides the point.
---
I just want to watch the demogorgon take an entire clip of bullets and walk away like it's nothing only to get punched and have it cry in pain
---
How is it my fault that my team can be shit and not know how to play against plague? The time they will run her around while broken is way less than the time I will run her around with red vomit. Also, going to save someone while the plague has red vomit and is near the hook is just stupid
---
ALSO the map was the snow one and I was ghost face so if one of yall was in my game just know i had no idea yall were good i just assumed off the beginning fuck ups yall were swf tryna meme
---
Honestly I don't get many Plagues, but they all run that build.
---
Ruin, Thanatophobia, Dying Light. Other survivors rarely (if ever) do generators, and you want to evade/hide from a Plague while perma-broken?
---
Last game I had against Plague, one person was downed, the other person was mending with borrowed time, and the third was getting chased before she even got Corrupt Purge.
---
It's far easier to cleanse and hide through Corrupt than it is to get caught broken on a generator and instantly go down, since you won't be near a pallet and Dead Hard is easily baited, you're giving Plague a 4k if you don't cleanse in randoms.
---
I PLAYED AGAINST A FACECAMPING SPIRIT TODAY.  WTF
---
When you prematurely drop two weirdly close pallets so the real one can save your ass but what's this?! THEY'RE BOTH DREAM PALLETS
---
Why do survivors hate going against her?
---
I GET I‚ÄôM TAKING A RISK BUT IF I HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANOTHER FUCKING RUIN SPAWNING IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE SO THAT OTHER FUCKING LOBBIES CAN SEE IT ONE MORE TIME: I‚ÄôM GONNA LOSE IT. JUST WHY THESE TERRIBLE SPAWNS? WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO SPAWN IT RIGHT NEXT TO A GOD DAMN SURVIVOR? WHY DON‚ÄôT YOU JUST PLACE A ‚ÄúCLEANSE HERE‚Äù SIGN OVER THE TOTEM SINCE THAT‚ÄôS WHAT IT BASICALLY FEELS LIKE.
---
well i may or may not be making wendy
---
You could also have a spectral sailor from The Fog, that could bellow fog from his person and reduce map visibility significantly. And summon spectral lighthouses that would billow their own fog bank and sound a horn if a survivor was touched by their light.
---
Imma Lithe/ Iron Will / Bond &amp; WGLF type a guy. I usually rotate it to mix it up for funzies tho
---
So he's OP when sane and garbage when  insane
---
Of they remove collision I could see a consistent bug making people stuck together lol.
---
Ooooo 
---
That would be interesting 
---
Don‚Äôt know what her perks would be though
---
Dude, altruism, look up the definition of that
---
That 3rd eye makes me uncomfortable but I love it anyways...
---
They say ruin is underpowered because it's found, and noed is op because you have to cleanse it. You can't win with people convincing themselves you can't run meta perks as killer.
---
I was thinking about that, but she was very interesting for me even when I didn‚Äôt have the game, anyway I also play another killers, mainly the Pig. I really appreciate your suggestions, I‚Äôll try them out, thanks!
---
I‚Äôm imagining this because of this comment
---
***Every Other Killer: How come that thing gets the cool toy??***
---
***The Thing: Yay! Zoom-zoom!***
---
They should really disabled the losses we get during these tests atleast. sure, some people will get away with quitting, but that's ok temporarily.
---
Thx. Since I‚Äôm new what does WGLF stand for (I know DS is deceisive)
---
Thx
---
A huntress without hatchets maybe... shes countered by survivors not cleansing
---
I‚Äôd love to give a good scare off of the new babies that came for Stranger Things.
---
I think you're a god damn rank 20
---
The gens will still never get done
---
Do your daily rituals automatically give you bp now instead of you receiving it when you want cause I had a ritual where I needed to escape with a new item. I did then the ritual disappeared and so did the item???
---
If you can get away from Self Care it forces you to play smarter and find your team mates. Its not a bad thing if you use it , but it worked for me.
---
If I run her around for longer than my teammates, they can complete more gens before somebody gets hooked. It has nothing to do with selfishness
---
For some reason the last day of Blood Hunts are always brutal.
---
Maybe you didn‚Äôt get a safe hook, maybe try again?
---
Basically that survivor on the generator is getting stalked by Michael up to tier II/III
---
NOED IS THE ONLY PERK IN THE GAME THAT SEEMS LIKE CHEAP BULLSHIT TO ME.  I NEVER USE IT AS KILLER, BECAUSE I CAN ADMIT WHEN I SUCK AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.
---
Do you have to play survivor for the vials?
---
It's not down down. They broke something when they put PC on dedicated servers. Every now and then I get into a lobby. 
---
So far they haven't acknowledged the issue.
---
Should just become "It takes X seconds to remove yourself from the trap". With Trapper add-ons increase how long it takes to remove yourself from the trap.
---
Neither have I, but matchmaking seems to think otherwise.
---
YESTERDAY I GOT 2 FACECAMPING BUBBAS AND A FACECAMPING PIG
---
üñï this
---
I was literally loading into a match as killer doing this when I saw this.
---
If I feel like plundering I go with Plunderer's Instinct + Ace in the Hole + 2 other perks (usually Balanced Landing/Dead Hard and Borrowed Time)
---
If not, I usually use these perks: Dead Hard/Balanced Landing/Iron Will/BT/Unbreakable/Prove Thyself
---
Nah, I think a way better and way simpler change would to simply let trapper have all his traps in hand at the start of the game instead of scattered around
---
The stupidest one is that spirit is too op and should get nerfed to the ground. These sissy‚Äôs just rant and don actually learn how to counter her
---
What if she doesn't go for you?
---
What if a teammate isn't as good as you?
---
Are you rank 15 or what?
---
dedicated servers are being tested today. I've also had no actual problem with them and ive been playing a lot today.
---
Yeah I wanna play with friends who have a different platform
---
That's why you have an option to do it
---
This is your very first ever post?
---
My good man. Welcome to hell. It's all downhill from herr
---
Decisive strike has no use for me, i tried to use it but often I am left on the floor while he goes after someone else.
---
Bubba doesn‚Äôt need to be smart, he knows how to use his chainsaw to kill people and that‚Äôs enough.
---
Trapper, wraith, and doctor have better weapons than myers, and since they‚Äôre all similar size they would have an advantage. A knife isn‚Äôt a good weapon against things like chainsaws, machetes, hammers, and steel spiked bats.
---
This ^
---
Fuck the doctor. He seriously ruins the game for me
---
Adrenaline and Decisive strike  are very situational, very very often they have 0 use in matches.
---
well u could say his lunge has some... properties...
---
Confirmation bias
---
Let me explain why Freddy is waaaaayyyyy better than those, first Lullaby if u guys know why huntress is actually good is cause her terror radius is smaller and that confuse people which make her be able to catch people in unsafe places or even people run at her without knowing due to the lullaby(same for Freddy), Teleport/Fake teleport, Billy has map pressure due to his mobility, something that is really helpful to get into chases, but as soon as he is in a chase his pressure over everyone is basically 0, Freddy being able to not just teleport but faking it while in a chase causes a bit of a slowdown on gens, all this is comparing them with perks but no add ons, of course if u want to go with basic Freddy vs Instasaw Billy or 1 shot Huntress yeah those 2 may have more kill potential, but they don‚Äôt win, they kill. I probably missed a few points.
---
If you think that‚Äôs bad, imagine all 4 survivors being in that room and a leather face comes and insta downs all of you
---
nice matchmaking indeed
---
That's actually not a very niche example at all and regardless it would result in an unwinnable game 100% for the survivor if they literally have no option to escape once the hatch is closed.  They'd be trapped in the match forced to search boxes which the killer would simply patrol knowing this.  EGC may be killer sided but there's still some chance of getting out at least.  Pigs traps remaining unchanged would have removed the possibility completely.
---
The demogorgon is peeking into red ranks finally, I (foolishly) hope all killers will be buffed into being strong one day
---
If all killers were around the same power level as spirit I‚Äôd die happy
---
Pig is very annoying to play against imo. The trap takes like 3-4 mins sometimes to find the right box and that‚Äôs if you aren‚Äôt found again with your obnoxious beeping head. I don‚Äôt think she needs buffs.
---
 Did you? 
---
https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/02/ps4-cross-play-exits-beta-now-a-full-feature-for-developers
---
It clearly says there it's a full feature for developers. Both in there and in the Wired article.
---
And cross play is not strange for the PS4, SFV has had it since 2016 (PC and PS4).
---
Hopefully your right!
---
You're right that's to get it to tick down but it shouldn't kill when going through Hatch or Gates when powered even if it is ticking. The change is kinda obvious why considering EGS doesn't stop while someone is hatted. 
---
You can technically cheese it by putting a hat on at last gen, hooking the guy during last gen or after in EGC, blocking his rescue for a while then watching him die that way but that's a lot of time to effectively waste.
---
Vigo can't get close enough to nurse to infect her.
---
Plus from the time you hear Plague's TR to the time she gets within lunge distance is 6.5 seconds (assuming you aren't running); this is especially bad since you can get cornered on a generator easily and not be able to run "away" (having to essentially run at an angle where she can cut you off) to reach a pallet.
---
It's a death sentence, especially since meta-Plague is new-Dying-Light and Thanatophobia, playing against Plague means you have to be patient and plan ahead.
---
Just like with Demogorgon you have to be ultra-stealthy and keep enough alive to pop the last two gens at the same time, otherwise you're in for a portal 3-gen and no one is getting out.
---
Jane is a man.
---
I'd call pennywise the dead light
---
thank you for the answer, and ive personally had more problems than normal with jankyness but that may be something else
---
My point is Decisive is only a threat to primarily babykillers.  Good killers know not to camp and tunnel.  We hook and leave to pressure gens and down our next survivor to keep the hooks flowing and the game disrupted.  Even if someone gets farmed in front of us we are smart enough to simply change targets and focus the unhooker.  Doing this turns Decisive and Borrowed Time players into 2 perk survivors.  If you still feel D Strike is a crutch your killer play is the problem.
---
it's called confirmation bias
---
I saw it. It was smol.
---
Yeah its annoying that no one fixed that since the release of GF...Its a infinite insta down that killer, a better Myers
---
You actually cannot escape a non deaf spirit with headphones, iron will or not. Footsteps, grass, scratches, all of these can still paint a picture. Hell, if you really want to use 0 brain power you can use stridor, and iron will is a nonissue, sure, it's "harder" to literally unphase on top of a survivor, but you'll be ridiculously close enough anyways to get a free hit. "Mindgaming" at loops is this: stand still, and they run close enough to you  and if they dont move, phase at literally any time and get a free hit, or they run to another loop, in which case you still phase to them and get a free hit. Mindgames that literally guarantee a hit regardless of what you do. In order to not get hit the survivor would have to predict the exact moment you decided to phase and move to the other side or drop the pallet. Which they would have to do several times in a row. All these people saying "adapt" yet they don't actually tell you HOW you're supposed to adapt.
---
Haha yes I swear Freddy mains ALWAYS be looking just like this as soon as a player gets in the vicinity of a dream pallet.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to but it doesn‚Äôt. Lots of people have reported either escaping or seeing people escape with active traps since the change was made. It doesn‚Äôt come up that much because most people don‚Äôt chance it being random. It would be nice if Behaviour fixed that particular bug while they‚Äôre removing every bug that gives the Pig a slight advantage.
---
It‚Äôs ugly I‚Äôm glad we got bill and it was fixed
---
That would be awful.
---
Finally reached into red ranks as Anna... just get obliterated (and bm-ed) in every match. I guess, it's Rin time now =/
---
The killer offering does not reveal itself.
---
Me: Spooky
---
As someone who plays Plague as a secondary let me give some tips here:
---
1. Aiming to reset all the fountains is worthless. Any good Plague player will be overjoyed at four fountains and not try to hit with vile purge because they know the pools will be reset. 
---
2. When Plague has corrupt purge, loop high walls as much as possible and try to pallet stun, she loses her power when she gets stunned.
---
3. If the match is going well, wait until the generators are all done to cleanse, this will often fuck up the endgame strats of a Plague and force them to go far from the gates to grab the pool, making it much easier to escape.
---
&gt;It's far easier to cleanse and hide through Corrupt than it is to get caught broken on a generator and instantly go down, since you won't be near a pallet and Dead Hard is easily baited, you're giving Plague a 4k if you don't cleanse in randoms.
---
One of your teammates is probably getting chased, downed, and hooked while you're hiding. You're giving them a 3k if not a 4k in randoms if you start cleansing and hiding.  
---
High rank anti-plague gameplay is a hard gen rush.  Can't heal? No time wasted there.  No time wasted purging, no time wasted urban evasion-ing around the map, no time wasted hiding, etc.  No-cleanse gen rush is the best strat against the plague if you want to try to get your whole team out.
---
Jump into a locker with it to force the grab or to force them to waste the remainder of the timer wasting their time if they're foolish enough to tunnel Vision one player like that.  I had a Bubba pull this against me yesterday.  I'm cool with it if they are cool with the time they're losing playing like that.
---
They should just make totems unable to be cleansed but have a set number of charges or timer before deactivating. Decent compromise for both sides.
---
Exactly,  that's why I don't  run it.
---
&gt;inb4 but you need ruin at rank 1 
---
Literally git gud
---
But as we all know, and has been said countless times.
---
Lore isn't a good reason to punish playing according to mechanics.
---
Pig was my main but I had to switch to ghost face to actually succeed and rank up (BTW this was rank 7)
---
You don't need ruin, git gud
---
Thx. The David one right?
---
All the yes.
---
yes why not?
---
I'm trying to upvote you guys. Maybe get it to 0 at least. I'm sorry. I tried.
---
What if you get caught in the open?
---
Against Demogorgon, you have enough room to dodge the Shred. Against Huntress, you have enough room to dodge the hatchets.
---
Against Hillbilly? He can just flick into your attempted dodge, so you're f**ked. 
---
Being dangerous in the open should be Leatherface's thing, while Billy is better in corridors and against people running toward windows.
---
All I'm saying is, there's a reason Hillbilly's the only loopable Killer who's considered to be roughly as strong as Spirit and Nurse.
---
Console just needs better optimization and higher sensitivity options
---
‚ÄúAbused‚Äù
---
DS and Head On were literally useless when enduring affected them to be fair. The stun was less than a second and the killer was literally able to act the same time as the survivor and just re-down them instantly.
---
No sorry
---
Okay, speed burst, but unless you are getting chased by the killer, or hurt, it will have little impact in the match. if he killer has NOED, the heal will be useless.
---
I get it
---
Yeah, connection issues all around. I just know it's not your connection. It's the servers connection. I've been booted to the main screen every two minutes since 130pm.
---
I'm gonna call you lazy title guy
---
For one word, it can easily be recorded by the VA and sent digitally.
---
Oh they are introduced way before Red ranks, well maybe not nurse but spirit is everywhere, idk where Billy went
---
Adept Blendette
---
Use object and don‚Äôt try to get him out that much. Just hide behind things or just loop him if he reveals you
---
true true honestly
---
You literaly just said Rank Reset is your friend. Which means to get the trophies, you should play against bad survivors.
---
If your argument is that it shouldn't be something you can cheese, yet how you recommend getting it is to......cheese it....
---
Then it might as we just be "Win/4 Kills" :P
---
SWFs made killers need to be buffed to unreasonable levels to compensate which means solos get destroyed and they‚Äôre completely unfun to play against as killer. They‚Äôve basically destroyed the balance of the game. Really is the devs fault for not balancing the game properly and enabling them to bully other players without recourse.
---
You don't need to master Billy.
---
Run charge time add-ons, walk up to Survivor, hold L2, win.
---
- Match Cancelled - 
---
Player disconnected while loading
---
Gen rushing.
---
Gen rush only happens when the killer doesnt put any pressure on the survivors. What else are the other survivors supossed to do when the killer is chasing someone else?
---
Need to equip a specific perk (ruin) to counter a poor game design and having instead of a 5min game maybe a 6min game, is not a good design
---
I agree that DS does have advantages at end game but there are more instances where DS can have impacts early to mid game. I don‚Äôt tunnel but it still irks me a lot, guess it comes down to preference or something
---
Nah I like being a rando in swf lobbies.  One of two things happens.  Either they know what they're doing and you have a strong game against the killer OR they're absolutely boosted as shit and you get to watch some pretty funny antics typically involving throwing themselves at the killer and yolo farming the shit out of each other.  On top of this being entertaining to watch it usually means you're carrying the game so it's an easy pip even if you die.
---
The English is just butchered man
---
Did he change the reply or something? It seems pretty normal right now.
---
I hope this implies cross-progression too. At least for perks, characters and cosmetics.
---
Go on
---
Not very accurate. You still don't get the difference between "facecamping" and "BMing". The first one is just a strategy, that most survivors hate and other one is being rude to someone.
---
And if you don't hit anyone, you eliminate the other 2
---
Pussy
---
Sudden seems not good with the exhausted. It damages players who use the absence of exhausted to save themselves (dead hard, head on, etc.) maybe instead you could mori them instead of blindness like rancor and aggravation
---
Have you ever played her though.. Like playing against just strong killers vs playing as the killer is two different things
---
‚ÄúCleave is a large attack with your axe after.‚Äù
---
Did you mean lunge instead of large? And ‚Äúafter‚Äù what? Bad first sentence here that only confuses.
---
On the other hand you‚Äôve got some serious balance issues with this character, which I understand is a concept, but rather alarming. The ‚Äúno scratch marks‚Äù part being a very alarming one, and the fact that this would be another ‚Äúno terror radius‚Äù killer isn‚Äôt really great. If you don‚Äôt Cleave, the killer could forever be in no terror radius but with a much faster speed than Scratch Mirror Myers.
---
And others have already mentioned the issues with Hex: Sudden Betrayal, which is unclear as to whether the effects stack or just change as the tokens increase in number.
---
No, its shit
---
Enlight me, how do you counter a decent spirit?
---
What‚Äôs in there?
---
DS is in it
---
From a stealth build yes it‚Äôs useless but in a distraction or savior type build it‚Äôs must have. I should have included that in my previous statement.
---
Again? Wasn‚Äôt it in there last week
---
Literally how? Survivors don‚Äôt require aim except from flashlight and it‚Äôs not exactly difficult the only disadvantage survivors have is not being able to 180 quicker but even that isn‚Äôt a big deal people act like console players move at the speed of a sloth
---
It's nowhere near a bad perk, it's still decent at all ranks of play, although it does fall off in quality at higher ranks, it is still immensely powerful. The perk is at worst a high tier, as shown by it still being a meta perk.
---
Well, we have two whole different experiences in the game. On top of it, I am learning to be selfish cause people be waiting for me to get to second stage of the hook until they save me, and dont really get much done.
---
i agree but its in the game gotta move on with it if u gotta Camp to secure your kill then do it
---
God the eye makes me so uncomfortable
---
Yes, it's Blenderette, just like it's Bowserette.
---
It‚Äôs a game... if the game gets you so tilted that you use the word abuse... then it might be time to take a break.
---
No I was simply providing you an alternative since you seem dead set on getting these trophies and appear to be struggling in getting them.  Some of the hardest adepts I've done were against solid swf groups on bad maps.  I got Legion against a 4 man on Coldwind.  I got  Wraiths against a 3 man on Macmillan.  They're possible just playing the game normally too.  But if you feel you need them and need the help rank reset does make them far easier.
---
Replace Billy with Huntress. I have been only facing pure tryhard Spirits and Nurses w/ occasional Huntress. Hell, if I am lucky I get a Freddy (but it's rare). Surprisingly this whole past month up to now I have faced only 1 Billy at red ranks.
---
The demogorgon isn't from earth
---
Doing gens, you
---
Did they message you after the game?
---
Iron will, mind games, plus she is slower than most killers so she is very loopable. You can‚Äôt just complain without looking at the facts
---
It's a Russian Youtuber called Aloona Larionova that the Pewdiepie adopted for looking like a female version of his editor BradWOTO and both of them kind of acknowledged it
---
Nurse is super arguable, because if you can break LOS your chances of not getting hit are way higher, but still not a guarantee.  Spirit on the other hand, unless your run iron will you have pretty much the same chance of getting hit no matter what you do.
---
Failing to hit a Ruin skill check against Ruin 3 costs you 7 seconds of time. (5% progress loss (IE 4 seconds) + 3 seconds of generator sparking that you can't work on the generator) A generator takes 80 seconds without a toolbox. This means that if you get 11 skill checks against Ruin (which isn't hard to do) you've effectively doubled the amount of time it takes to complete the gen.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs defiantly not as bad as getting a rank 17 survivor which I can‚Äôt help but feel bad for
---
Hate how they nerfed my girl pig
---
That sucks, hopefully they pay attention to use console peasants
---
Oh did it just reset today?
---
Show us on the doll where he made you fail your skillchecks
---
It‚Äôs a bug, but lunge is avoided easily. I was bored and tbagging the exit like all survivors in the full health state do, and the demogorgon lunges at someone self healing who was right next to me; I was less than half a meter away and I still wasn‚Äôt hit
---
It's true he's coming and will be an exclusive for the Soulja Boy Console port
---
That‚Äôs a healing perk 
---
Calling it
---
I still want Jacket
---
It resets every week at like 8pm EST on Tuesday‚Äôs
---
I mean most of the Survivor skins are basically Victorian botanist outfits since they're meant to be students of Vigo gathering pustula nectar for him.
---
I feel absolutely **ATTACKED** by people messing with my internet points. These mentally ill fools, how dare they!!
---
On xbox replace Nurse with Ghostface. Other than that same thing
---
Alert, knockout, vigil, surveillance
---
Problem with this game is playing solo you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going through others heads. If two are working on a gen they‚Äôre probably almost done and think the other is walking to rescue you. Meanwhile maybe the third is working on a solo gen and thinks the other 2 are walking to save you. That‚Äôs why bond is heavily favored with solos because you get lots of info about other teammates without headsets.
---
Oh no. Not the skill checks. Always knowing exactly where I am at all times even if I've not been near him all match
---
Super imbalanced in my opinion
---
This comment is merciless
---
I gave the last survivor the hatch and he was thankful for it. The others did not message me. Pretty good sports with such a bad matchmaking.
---
I wish you still could because Steve's scream is really annoying
---
That was intentional, billy and bubba down the survivor if they are vaulting the pallet while he chainsaws it. This is just unintentional bs.
---
Godette
---
Yea, but when the distraction build is gettin 1 shot, it pretty much makes their perks have lilttle impact, specially if you hurt. Exhaust perks might give you a head start in the race against the killer, but the cooldown, and exhaust will make them have very lilttle impact if the killer read your perk usage.
---
&gt; Devour hope
---
When you get 2 tokens, it always gets cleansed :c
---
Don't worry. I won't rest until I do.
---
&gt; So you think an acceptable level of strength is when a good nurse player can 4k literally every single game with her base kit? 
---
I think every killer in the game should have the tools which allows the person to do as well as the knowledge/reflexes/situational awareness/wisdom of the person allows for. If that person is a great killer, nothing should hold that person back from mopping the floor with survivors each and every time until he/she meets a survivor/SWF that is of equal or better skill. The power of the killer is just a tool, it's the person behind the monitor which makes or break a good/great killer.
---
The problem is that, for most killers, the devs have not even given the killer the tool to allow him/her to have the chance at being a good/great killer. With the exception of Nurse/Spirit/Freddy/Billy/Hag/Huntress/Michael/Demo are handicapped via the devs through the most RIDICULOUS of ways and that's what makes them not viable in red ranks when the person behind the screen has all the know-how and reflexes to be a great killer main. 
---
And the devs handicap those unviable killers (Pig, Ghostface, Plague, Wraith, Trapper, Leatherface, Doctor, Legion) due to their lack of understanding of their own game and/or due to the complaints of low skilled survivor mains. Every one of these killers should be buffed to Myers levels at the very least, Spirit levels at the best. Eight killers are viable (and by viable I mean can hold their own against a SWF), and eight are not. Buff the eight, not nerf someone else.
---
&gt; I'm not saying that she should be nerfed beyond recognition, I want them to nerf her to a level where she is actually balanced.
---
The only thing that was a little unfair about the Nurse were here range addons and her 4th and 5th blinks. And it looks like they are tweaking those to work in different ways and/or nerfing them. That's enough to put the Nurse on par with the Spirit now for the 1a/1b best killer in the game. It's enough. Nothing more should be touched about her. It's *enough*. No other viable killer should be nerfed in any way whatsoever whether it be their base or their addons.
---
After the Ghostface foolishness (nerfing him just after buffing him), BHVR has made Freddy extremely viable, and the Demo viable. Let's continue that streak with the next killer to make it three in a row. The proposed changes to the Nurse's addons won't affect her much and keeps her as a tie with the Spirit. Let's not fuck this all up by having another Ghostface fiscal.
---
Im all for critisism. Mind telling me why?

All EULA's are like this. They have to get their point across.

I stopped caring about the scoring system long ago.
---
I‚Äôve ended 4 man SWFs during endgame by sitting next to the hook, altruism just doesn‚Äôt always pay off
---
Pro strats: purposely going down before the last gen is completely so the killer doesnt camp you in the end game

I would change ‚ÄúThe Writer‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe Caretaker.‚Äù Would LOVE a Shining character + Overlook/hedge map üî™
---
I got disconnected a few times like 2 days ago while playing survivor but I just chalked it up as my shitty WiFi‚Äôs fault
---
What killer and map?
---
I got my Nurse earlier shortly after posting this topic. I still think the Adept trophies for Killer are overtly needy and tedious compared to Survivor Adepts.
---
Then add in Survivors who make it impossible to get if they all go down too fast or don't unhook each other etc.
---
It's just needlessly tedious and annoying on Killer compared to Survivor who can hide in bushes all match then run out the gate once it's open and still get their's.
---
Sounds like fortnite or mine craft.
---
The joke
---
Your head
---
I think mom should be reworked in the same way ds was reworked, turn it into a hook perk.
---
After unhooking a survivor, mom is activated for 15 seconds
---
I find this comment delicately **indifferent**
---
Serious ask, there can be games with no obsession?
---
Thing is that changing how Ruin skill checks interact with the game would require a fundamental change to skill checks as a whole.
---
Dumbest post 2019. Just move on and grow up. Honestly shit are you at the game lmao. Get good
---
Tldr: killer bad
---
Well thank you kind sir I‚Äôm not really much worried about it just felt like I was doing something wrong as the killer
---
No because every killer runs it for a reason. The game is too fast without it, that would nerf every single killer who already struggles for kills
---
Imagine if this was a thing. We could build campfires near camping killers LMAO
---
Wow someone‚Äôs confident lol. Spirit is high tier, but imo the only killer with absolutely no counter is Nurse. At least Spirit still has to go through doorways/windows and break palettes.
---
I am so proud of this community
---
i posted an edited version, hopefully that one makes more sense
---
Just wait. He gets better.
---
Pauli‚Äôs Esther confirmed this 100% trueeee
---
what part?
---
Demomomomomomogorgon on swamp
---
I love his screams when I hook him, oh lord the downvote storm comin
---
It's also a big problem with the pallet density on each map. However judging by the Badham rework they seem to be pushing towards pallets that are more open for mindgames, which I do appreciate.
---
Then I call Randy Orton over and, well you know the rest
---
Oh you mean you can't counter it with ruin, overcharge, lullaby, noed, etc?
---
Totally unbalanced, sure
---
It's just something annoying, just like noed, but it's fine.
---
You're taking it personally when you shouldn't. You're apart of the team and should be treated like any other survivor by the killer.
---
&gt; You couldn‚Äôt have just made a little line that connects the circle above their heads?
---
Exactly.
---
Yeah, he gets better. But I still wanted hopper way more than steve.
---
Yeah the killer tunneled all 4 survivors at once it seems
---
No other killer has the ability to flat out remove the chance of attempting an escape during the EGC.  Pig would have been the lone exception to where she could physically make it impossible to attempt a hatch or exit gate escape.  That isn't balanced man I don't care how "niche" you want to say it is.  It flat out would not be a fair mechanic and the devs recognized this and wisely changed her traps to compensate for this.  The egc collapse hatch mechanic is already well tipped in the killers favor we don't need to have a killer that can essentially remove any possibility of not getting the 4k in that scenario.  It is hard enough to successfully open the door against that and you think it would be balanced if before even being allowed to attempt this, you need to be able to successfully search her jigsaw boxes while she knows those are your only option.  Most can be seen from a distance easily.  The second she lays eyes on you and she will unless they're full potato your game is over.

Don‚Äôt worry keep watching the show
---
I THINK THATS YOU MATE, MY COMPUTER IS SHIT AND NEVER GETS THAT BAD UNLESS I JOIN A HIGH PING GAME

Never played nurse. What does the add on do?
---
I HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR TEN GAMES TO GET INTO A MATCH AND THE GAME WON‚ÄôT CONNECT ME TO ONE!!!
---
That‚Äôs 2spooky
---
Posts and comments like these I can not get behind. Not every SWF is full of toxic blendettes and sweaty teabagging tryhards.
---
Sometimes you just want to casually enjoy a game together with some friends and have a good time, not even intending to be toxic in the first place only to get crushed by Spirits/Billys with Mori etc. who think their life depends on it
---
I‚Äôm rank 2 survivor literally couldn‚Äôt get a game on survivor. Took me 10 minutes to load in with two rank 16‚Äôs and a rank 8. Like I just gave up in the end. These dedicated servers are fucking annoying so far
---
I'm not the Claudette.
---
I dc'd after my two other teammates got basement camped so Claude at least had a chance of escaping.
---
Yes I agree with you on the survivors side as I previously mentioned I believe for the sake of fairness they should also require a double pip which would make them respectable achievements at that point.
---
Um like KILLING?!
---
My roommate: "I'm headed to the store. Have fun killing!"
---
Oh. Oh I will.

Prerework Legion with no heartbeat at the beginning?

Please learn how to break him out before you complain.

Damn, sorry dude you were just unlucky.

Or "Come here, lemme rub your ass."

Ghostface's power continues progressing if he stops stalking; your progress does not. If you looking it starts over.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I think of that before...‚Äù

Yea a hawk that‚Äôs named tony is gonna be added

Yeah..

Yep, if nobody's using obsession perk/addons there's no obsession.

He gets better

Replace Nurse with Ghostface and Billy with Demogorgon and that‚Äôs my red rank experience.
---
where is that, Lerys?
---
Had same thing with a teammate jane after unhooking
---
For me I got vigil cause I don't have the Freddy dlc do I guess it's personal preference
---
You got downvotes for giving people understanding of the mechanic. This sub is just a mess. They‚Äôre in denial about not understanding
---
I had a daily
---
Camping a little in order to secure a kill is fine, but staring at someone for the full two minutes isn't. Just like how bringing a toolbox is fine, but prove thyself, brand new part, engineers toolbox, and resilience all at the same time isn't.
---
They buffed play with your food along with dying light. They just didn't tell us.
---
Character development
---
DAMN She's terrifying!
---
and so is legion but you dont see me complaining
---
&gt; Just started watching Stranger Things
---
Oh trust me you will know why
---
Pig gameplay is like 90% her low height and crouch/uncrouch mindgame to lose heartbeat/red stain and 10% her actual abilities.
---
He might be a clown (not), but you're the entire circus
---
He‚Äôs not broken, I play GF at red ranks and I go against a mix, survivors who know how to break me out and the ones that just stand in front of me trying to look at me. It‚Äôs funny because the bad ones always complain. Yet he‚Äôs so easy to break out.
---
Not worth my time. I'm not reading that lol
---
big ol group of myers just standing together chillin
---
Just because you are playing solo shouldn't mean the killer needs to alter the way they play to adapt to your situation.
---
Bc you‚Äôre rank 18
---
Can confirm
---
If you didn't take time out of you loop to taunt the killer that wouldn't have happened TBH...
---
I‚Äôm DBD? I just assume it‚Äôs his voice acting after getting hooked...

You're paranoid op, the survivor had no idea you were In that locker lmao, she was just stupidly trying to hide
---
I‚Äôm not even in red ranks and I still got 3 (different) Billy‚Äôs in a row
---
Not that you need that offering anyways, I feel like I start next to the whole team in 3 out of 4 matches.
---
Because he you‚Äôre weren‚Äôt revealing over 20% for the reveal time. Duhhh
---
Become the strongest one trick or succumb to the dark side of Spirit/Nurse/Billiam.
---
The other day I was playing solo and was matched up with rank 2 and two rank 20s against a rank 2 killer. I am rank 2 survivor.
---
I actually don't care for Legion, and a lot of my best 4k's have been with Clown so I'm pretty excited for this new skin. I don't see why people even like Legion.
---
I did say that because with old Enduring killer could pretty much eat your DS and tunnel you to death
---
You're an idiot, not even survivors with bond can see you if you're in a locker
---
HAUL ASS
---
Literally so annoying. It kept playing the damn music to say I was then it‚Äôd stop and just start over again. I just pure DC‚Äôed as it was absolute bullshit tbf
---
He's definitely not lol. He's actually a great streamer who always provides insight and gives tips to his viewers. He's no god, that's for sure but he is good at the game.
---
lol That's your concern? If it's the lake of FoV when crouching, that's because of how low the camera is to the ground.
---
Nice bro. You have to be a David main for life now.
---
To the entity
---
So you're just gonna ignore the part where Sony hasnt announced it ro be a full feature? Ok
---
Had an entire team quit at the start of the match, then tell me it was because Freddy is OP and I‚Äôm unfair for playing him. Also, they had a key and insta heal.
---
Bloody cosmetics do not have sounds, good sir.
---
But you didn‚Äôt reveal enough of him for long enough , what do you expect to happen lmao

Wait, hold on: you understand that you could always escape through the hatch with an RBT, right? Even if it‚Äôs active you can still do that.

no

Playing as a PC killer I would love to face some console players, but as a survivor on PC I dread the console potato's.
---
I thought it was funny. Sounds to me like people were offended
---
I've said it before I've said it again. Putting on dying light is a direct counter to anti healing perks, it gives the one survivor who has the most opportunity to rescue and heal free botany knowledge and isnt effected be dls debuff

Maybe you don't like to read.

why are ppl so fast to think when someone finds something not funny they are offended lol
---
It‚Äôs normal to add files to a game in the background as mixes assets ahead of time to see how the game treats the raw data. Normally the dev build server behaves from the test or live variants so you‚Äôd be surprised how many games do this kind of thing.

For me the most important reason to stay awake is borrowed time.

I thought it was funny

yes thats what i meant

Freddy main here, his add ons revolve around slowing heals and repairs on people in the dream world.
---
He also has snares which when stepped on/over will slow the survivor down tremendously.
---
His dream pallets are self explanatory.
---
But if you're awake his power becomes useless since they only show up and effect sleeping survivors.
---
He also regenerates his teleport a lot slower. 15% each survivor.

there's clearly better killers, but I usually do pretty well as a pig main in like, mid to lower ranks
---
Agreed. Normally hiding in a closet in a horror movie gets you brutally murdered, but here it somehow makes you untouchable. Iron Maiden should let you Mori people if you catch them in a locker.
---
Because usually people only don't fi f something funny as not funny when it offends them
---
why tf you stop looking for him??? You had to right living at that point XD
---
Hail!
---
Show me a video of it then. Don‚Äôt be childish and just start throwing insults. Just shows how incapable you are of having a discussion, so it‚Äôs more believable that you‚Äôre incapable of looking at a killerüòÇüòÇ
---
Theres like 5 bones, do em. It takes time but it‚Äôs not fair to a killer when a SWF all run adrenaline, dead hard, purple flashlights, and d strike and they still complain that you ran noed. Not saying killers can‚Äôt be toxic either, but if you‚Äôre toxic, expect a taste of your own medicine.
---
Don‚Äôt talk down to me then you spastic.
---
Not even on the killer just other players
---
not really no. funny is subjective just because you find it funny does not mean others will and I find it silly you would resort then to thinking if they do not find what I find funny they must be offended
---
He has the best character arch
---
Now do one for Randall Flagg.
---
Please, how did I talk down to you?
---
Hi, so they should be rehashing her add ons so her very rare plaid flannel perk will be common which will help you learn how to gauge your blinks. It's how my friend learned her
---
Can't wait to Ollie through windows and grind over loops.
---
You know what forget it, i dont get where you're going with this. All i said was that it was still in the Beta face(which i misread) and that Sony hasnt confirmed anything. 
---
But looks like you're too adamant to prove me wrong to even read what i was saying so good on you. Bye
---
No that‚Äôs not it but that still sucks lol. 22 is still pretty insane.
---
Tbh it‚Äôs harder than it seems
---
I tried to use the pose/look from one of his official renders and literally my other friend said the same thing lmao
---
Every killer
---
You're right. But I speak from experience. People are easily offended and how they act tells you if it's just not funny or if it made them butthurt. Usually 9-10 they're butthurt
---
What's the issue here
---
I actually like this idea quite a bit
---
Hello Meme Maker
---
So you don‚Äôt give her the red spit that lets her hit you from range.
---
No you're just spamming the button too early lol I do this too
---
2-30 is your time frame. Sometimes more.
---
You just hit space too early. I see no issue
---
Cos then she gets blood vomit sniper power
---
It's because they are currently testing the dedicated servers on live.
---
I was going to the window but went into the locker
---
10-15 min is kinda normal for your rank. When i was rank 19 i had to queue for 30+ min to get a game.

RNG is just the best isn't it? Pretty much the reason I don't play trapper üòÇ

I really only watch zub and sometimes noob, i used to watch monto but as hes gotten more popular hes gotten increDIBLY big headed and his comedy has been watered down to like, i feel, childish comedy. I hate seeing the slow the game down a little bit meme its so stupid and how he zooms on his face and distorts it. Ik comedy is opinion based but the most annoying thing about him is MONTO DOESNT MESS UP he literally always has a back up comment for a mistake to make it seem like the survivor is dumb and doesnt play normal, lag, or something silly. Superiority complex is real
---
I AM PLEASED
---
Probably lag switching
---
Pretty good job so far
---
A lot of people are just kinda selfish TBH. "I'm not having fun, so i'm just gonna leave" 
---
I used to do that as well, but then after other people did it enough, I realized how much it ruins the game, and I stopped. The only time I DC now, is if the killer is blocking me in a corner. I.e holding me hostage. (Which is **extremely** rare)
---
You were no where near close enough to the window to vault it of course you went into the locker this isn't a bug or an issue of any kind
---
I don't see how that's much worse than being instant downed every hit.
---
It powers plague up and she's able to instadown you
---
You‚Äôve broken the law, *administers downvote
---
Ohh okay, makes sense. Thanks bud!
---
Left 4 Dead zombie to give Bill flashbacks
---
She instant downs you if you don't cleanse.
---
Bro are you seriousness right now?  Of course I know that it's always been like that since she was introduced.  We've been talking about the EGC collapse this whole time meaning she closed the hatch removing it as an option.  The whole discussion has been about with her old traps you physically wouldn't be able to attempt to leave the trial since they'd kill you at an exit gate too.  Her old traps forcing box searches would have been broken with the new hatch close mechanic.  The devs recognized this I think it's pretty fair logic to follow.

I seen the comments on that post none of the ppl seemed offended  well besides the OP

Ranged vs un ranged.

That makes sense with the edit.
---
I had a game yesterday where me and another player jumped the hook at the same time and neither of us had Deliverance or luck offerings. Killer was real cool about it in end game chat. It was really buts for that to happen.
---
But at least then she has to be close and actually melee you to where if you‚Äôre good at juking/looping it makes it hard. If she has the red stuff, a lot easier to hit you when you‚Äôre looping or juking.
---
this is it, the best post of all time
---
This is a amazing drawing and a price of art
---
Seconded. Plague with corrupt purge is actually MUCH stronger then just with 1 hits. It gives her so much power. And if she has that and you are healed (ex: after cleansing) you can go down in about 5 seconds instead of like 30-40 for a chase even on injured state.
---
Honestly, the end game collapse is completely pointless, and only made the devs nerf end game builds into the ground because they dont understand nuance and ITS NERF OR NOTHING. It doesnt stop survivors holding the game hostage in any way shape or form.
---
Although I guess it did make hatch situations better, stands off were annoying, but now we actually have the new stand off, where the killer finds the hatch and has to wait at it until they see the survivor because if they insta close it they risk the fact that a survivor might just be sitting by and exit gate.
---
I'm sure it isn't.  You're much too busy with all the inaccurate suggestions you still have left to post tonight.
---
My manager overheard a friend and I talking about The Plague's power when she came out and he was very confused.
---
The main reason I don‚Äôt like NOED is because it rewards the killer for letting the gens get done. Adrenaline is fine because survivors should be rewarded for getting the gens done, not the killer.
---
Yeah but if you cleanse she can Insta down you from 10x the distance
---
Post Malone‚Äôs face gets me every time

It looks cool though. Lol. Wonder how the other killers would look like as teens. Lol. All rebellious looking.

Why does hillbilly have the biggest brain when he's essentially an M1 killer?

Just got Myers and I'm having a blast though :).

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be to op everyone who plays pig just kinda loses the people there chasing
---
I never realized it that is cool

An option will divide the player base and make it even worse.
---
Had a bad game vs a PC SWF? Just opt in to the console side and stomp them. 
---
Really fun and inituitive that isn't it?
---
Playing as ghost face.   ü§Ø
---
You‚Äôre instant down if you don‚Äôt cleanse. But you‚Äôre close to hopeless if you do cleanse as corrupt is a spray huntress. I play plague and when people cleanse I rarely lose. So easy to hit people. Playing against plague it‚Äôs a lot easier to loop her for ages as she‚Äôs a 4.6m/s and has no other abilities to get you. But giving her corrupt gives her range and makes loops useless against her. Only time cleansing is good is if you‚Äôve 4-3 gen yourself and cleanse other side of the map. Trust me as a plague player I do prefer it when people cleanse as I get multiple hits and can down some people who don‚Äôt cleanse. 1 cleanse let‚Äôs the whole team down. But only other strat is hiding every time she uses corrupt but that‚Äôs a huge waste of time.
---
Both sides can be equally as toxic so I really see no point in arguing.
---
This game is pretty much over all broken right now anyway -.-
---
I find that you tend to encounter that type of behavior at low ranks (still happens at mid-high ranks, but not as often) because new players or players not the best at the game get frustrated with certain mechanics, playstyles, perks, or killers that they play against. At higher ranks they develop a strategy to deal with that stuff so it‚Äôs less often that someone DCs.
---
MLGA SHOULD BE BASELINE.
---
Billy is an m1 killer... Are you serious...
---
Well well, look who's stalking in the tall grass...
---
Yah DCing really does mess things up for the remaining survivors, I've had people DC on first hook and it basically hands me the game on a silver platter, I'm glad you've stopped doing it.
---
But it still seems out of proportion, I could get reliable DCs in Dark Souls if I really tried but even that doesn't compare to this. It's every. Single. Game. And I simply don't get it.
---
I dont think hes necessarily BAD, I just think that's hes INCREDIBLY boring and basic.

---
Damn. You still replying? Hop off my duuude
---
I get the too fast thing, I just hate that the solution is that you as a survivor now get to focus on hitting a sliver in the UI.  Just so tired of that.  Would like a different solution to slowing the game / gens down (like the plague one where far genes can't be worked on, or ghostface where a nearby gen can't be worked on when a survivor is downed).
---
This is the most accurate shite...
---
Love seeing my 1 of my favorite communities having a "Shitpost crusader" ;)

I love you too

Guess spirit fury got a nerf
---
Trapper pro tip, put trap at bottom of that hole. Works every time.
---
Yeah I'm rank 8 killer and usually have to wait around 10 minutes or so for a game!
---
We aren‚Äôt all like this. You‚Äôre at a rank where people have little to no respect. You get players who think they‚Äôre amazing going against new players when they‚Äôre experienced so they rage quit if they die. When you get up the ranks people have respect, the odd few don‚Äôt but it used to be a lot worse.
---
If the locker wasn‚Äôt there, I would‚Äôve triggered a running vault at that distance
---
Freddy's lunge is wayyyyyy to big. He has a longer lunge than the spirit. Its actually ridiculous. Other than that tho the rework is great
---
Ghostface and demogorgon should be f tier
---
Looks good üòç
---
I suppose that makes sense, but It's still a very high percentage of players.
---
To play against survivors who aren‚Äôt toxic.
---
Yes!
---
He probably got downvotes because literally everyone knows this already and literally everyone knows snapping him out of night shroud is inconsistent too
---
Ghostface's thing is a perk, and smart players dont care about being sick. Run small game then to destroy ruin
---
Rule set no2 should be base kit tbh, that'd help a lot idk about a full rework tho
---
Absolutely!
---
It's toxic to a degree. I love chases and running the killer around as long as possible. I take advantage of the stigma that T-bagging is considered toxic so I can keep your attention on me. I mean no disrespect by it, I just need to buy time for my team to do gens and it works (for the most part). Only smart killers wisen up and realize I'm wasting their time. It's the sensitive ones that get mad or vengeful at my T-bagging.
---
That screams so funny
---
Why a rework, she is fine as she is. Please could you explain why the rework??
---
The only thing I disliked is the pink Feng outfit.. awful.. bring the bunny hoodie discarded outfit and you'll earn a lot of money BHVR, I guess they don't like them
---
Deserved for tunnelling
---
Weird, no 'vault' option..
---
I ALMOST GOT THE EVIL INCARNATE ACHIEVEMENT, BUT SOME JAKE WAS HIDING HIS ASS IN LOCKERS AND DOING GENS SO I COULDN'T GET THE LAST KILL. MEANWHILE SOME OTHER SALTY ASS WAS SPAMMING ME WITH MESSAGES ABOUT HOW I'M GONNA GET BANNED FOR FARMING. BHVR MAKE IT SO THAT TOMBSTONE WORKS ON DOWNED SURVIVORS. THIS IS BS!!

Yes I am... he gets looped like most do. If you force him to take the m1 he effectively has no power. The only thing he has is map pressure that's it. I can run him around for 2+ mins easy. I'm not even a survivor main.
---
I want my 42 seconds back
---
What‚Äôs x bone
---
Ghost face isn't that hard to break out or even if he stalks you, you should be able to look him long enough to run down your timer of death
---
Can they just add limited blink like Freddy's power?
---
I mean, she just have 10 blinks and if she wants more she just have to wait the reload
---
It‚Äôs not inconsistent, soon as I bought ghost face I stated to understand what breaks me out and what doesn‚Äôt. Therefore playing the other side I know what breaks him out and when to run for my fucking life.
---
Literally his mindset seems so ‚Äúmontos never wrong‚Äù and he constantly has a backup for being even slightly mindgamed just to call the survivor dumb by playing ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù he never accepts he got slightly outplayed and DS is still toxic to him when he blatantly tunnels with all the pressure he has in his games. Also he never posts videos with less than a 3K zubat and otz will gladly post an L

Just to be clear I am not a big fan of dedicated servers myself. I agree with most of what you said about them. I think that there are other issues that they should solve first before planning to add them.
---
But It's not so much the idea of putting them in the game or not. As I mentioned, it's the idea of announcing a date to the playerbase. Saying "Summer 2019!" or like now "Fall 2019" As a dev team you're putting unnecessary pressure on yourself by doing so. Especially with something as tedious and time-consuming as dedicated servers. If you don't meet the deadline that you set, you're going to get backlash from your players no matter what.

I'm more or less criticizing the habits that the devs seem to have. One of them being this one: announcing a deadline, then failing to meet it. Or being reactive rather than proactive to problems that keep popping up in the game after every big update. Content? It's awesome. Not gonna lie. Cosmetics? Just as awesome. But these habits are the things that annoy me about them sometimes.

For me, BHVR should ditch the idea of dedicated servers for now. Stabilize the game a bit, improve what's already there until you get it to a state where the majority are happy with its performance, THEN think about dedicated servers. Otherwise, they're putting too much on their plate.

I play both sides too, and its been inconsistent even when I was ghost face. When you're literally looking at him while he stands there in plain sight, he shouldn't expose you before you get him out of it, but that's usually how it goes unless you're lucky and the game actually registers it as you looking at him
