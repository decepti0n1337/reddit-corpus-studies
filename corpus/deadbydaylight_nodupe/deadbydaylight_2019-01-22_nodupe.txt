That would make legion be able to wreck this perk when it actually is a decent counter to him currently
---
---
---
I run dc :) 
---
Haha everyday. Also i have a small space between keyboard and screen where my cat likes to sleep, and sometimes he does sudden stretches that pushes play on my keyboard and turns the volume to 0 or 100(usually on 50) and shit like that. Really helping me with my chase when music suddenly start blasting in my ears at traumatising levels of volume. 
---
Yeah what the other commentator said. Or allow survivors to recover up to 50% of their exhaustion while sprinting.
---
I’m all for the extra points but I wanna add that any bonus altruism points in the game need to be for SAFE unhooks. Stop farming your teammates people. It’s not fun for the survivor or killer 
---
The Game isn't even a good map for killer anymore.
---
That's the only way I saw to do it? What did you think?
---
Just stop this whole DS v NOED nonsense, it takes up a lot of the posts on this subreddit and is getting really annoying, it's just people headbutting themselves constantly. 
---
Corn isn't even the reason Coldwind sucks (though it is a reason). The fact that survivors can see through walls removing all ability for the killer mindgame.
---
*Giggles profusely at 0 Sacrifices and 8 hour match length.*
---
He isn’t trash but he really messes with the current perk meta and people don’t like change. Survivors don’t wanna specialize they wanna run jack of all trades.  if people actually had to specialize then other killers would automatically move up rather then creating this crazy rank one nonsense of omega lvl nurses and Billy’s at rank 1 being the only killers you see
---
Do you play in Antarctica?
---
People figured out about:  
---
1. Tunneling one guy with Frank's Mixtape  
---
2. Moonwalking
---
Bugs like this are ones that I hope they don't fix. Innocent silly shit like this and the sliding Survivors and the flexing Killers make me smile whenever they happen.
---
Valid excuse to camp tbh
---
You think all 3 of them combined equals out to ds? 
---
God don't lol I am a Freddy main because he scared me most as a kid and it's just depressing lol. I still think a Dev hated him as a child and get's off to the fact they make him so weak lmao. 
---
There's me to. I really like them. ;-;
---

---
Though I do admit that they are very flawed right now and need a lot of tweaking.
---
I’m not sure what it is, it was your phrase after all. 
---
Nurse is good because she ignores all of the things that survivors are given in order to survive. The only obstacle nurse faces is how good you are at her.
---
put in a ticket to the support team. i did that once after losing a chunk of progress and they were happy to refund the bloodpoints to my account.
---
I'm literally level 15, I should not be with these people
---
I hate to be that guy, but this is just one of those *git gud* situations
---
&gt;Not a Tapp perk
---
&gt;Tapp
---
    (Yes I know the meme features LeBron James originally.)
---
Yes
---
You know you can just count to like 2 sec and swing after pickup on your obsession to cancel out DS. Ive been hit only a couple of times when i realy fuck up the timing. But 4 people with DS is broken
---
Nope,  ps4 in the good ol us of a.
---
Well, first of all you can't make Bloodlust into a perk. If you do, then you are creating a must-have perk. BUT! I do like the idea. Just implement it as a passive thing and not a perk. Bloodlust should make you able to end **tremendoulsy** long loops, yet shouldn't be "abusable". Getting a decent speed boost to end a loop at the cost of not getting bloodlust for *X* amount of seconds until exhaustion expires seems fine to me.
---
I'm of the firm belief that Freddy isn't bad but rather that every other Killer is better. He can still kill and he has his strengths and weaknesses over other Killers, it's just that his weaknesses far outweigh his strengths. Map hacks, game stall, and perma-invis doesn't outweigh the delay in being able to down a Survivor and the intense RNG involved in your effectiveness.
---
line of sight is harder for 3rd person in that map that 1st. feel like thats it because i just lose track of where the killer rotates to
---
Bloodlust isn’t needed even now. I see it maybe once or twice a game and I don’t go out of my way to get it, I just do. 
---
If you rely on bloodlust your not playing very well. 
---
Generators are hard to find and it's the smallest of all maps, making it easier for the killer to patrol - apply pressure.
---
Also if hex totems spawn in showers they are almost impossible to find.
---
From my experience you have to kill 4 survivors. So 1) You have to get 4 people in game (if you get 3 or 2 person game then there is no chance of getting it). The way doesn't matter, as long as they are dead -&gt; Sacrifice, Rancor, Mori, Devour Soap, all of them count. When someone loads into the game and the DCs it should also count as a kill.
---
As for how to get it, just play with the perks, it will come eventually. Get some good addons, possibly map offering that you are good at / like.
---
Thats doctor in a nutshell, just take those Bloodpoints with the L and go.
---
It got removed when they switched to the emblem system, there’s no real point in it being there with emblems, it was there to show you who you downed/hooked/killed. Back then ranking up was determined by how many kills you got, which often promoted camping and tunneling, so they changed it.
---
A killer can be counter-intuitive to basic game mechanics, unskilled and unfun, but still be underpowered at the same time
---
I’d rather lerys and the game than shelter woods at this point
---
poor kid
---
Killer exhaustion? 
---
It doesn't work that way.
---
Each trap is already tied to a random box.
---
If it were a 25% chance for each box there would be a 32% chance of not taking it off after trying all 4 boxes.
---
Nah, once in a 5 games it generates a tile that a good survivor can loop for minutes. You need bloodlust for that, especially when you play a killer that does not have ability that helps in chase **\*cough\* \*cough\*** *Wraith* **\*cough\*** . Other than that I notice it on killers with 110% movement speed (like Spirit when my ability is on cooldown or Hag when there are no traps they can run into).
---
What rank of Killer are you? What perks and level of perks equipped? If you have purple 3 perks at rank 20 of course you’re gonna get 4ks... 
---
OP, become a game designer at BHVR
---
Self Care is garbo now.
---
I swapped it for Bond and haven't looked back.
---
Lmao howd you know?
---
Rank 17, I used the Hag and had tier 2 of Hex Ruin. That's like the worst (best) killer perk in my opinion. I hate it so much when I'm a survivor. 
---
Killers who want the 4k will sit there and wait for you to hop in. And sometimes the survivor will not leave until the killer finds them. 
---
Lmao
---
You're right I only said PC as in standard PC that can run DBD well.  
---
That's why we can't have nice things.
---
So if you're juggling I should just sit and watch?
---
Is that your only perk? You mentioned playing a long time ago, which in turn gave you experience as killer against the free weekend players.
---
cuz the killer feels entitled to there 4k, anytime i play killer and in a hatch standoff i just hit them to get it over with and go on to the next match
---
The spirit is way to scary for me lol
---
You should get fancy BHVR flair
---
its a joke i think
---
It's so strange cause the game runs the best it ever had on me and my friends consoles. 
---
LMAOO THIS IS AMAZING 
---
More like:
---
An Undead Killer able to warp through time and space vs FUCKING WILLIAM BILL OVERBECK
---
I read that as art history or mental illness....
---
That doesnt sound to bad 
---
they're harder to kill if they aren't that stupid
---
“Aw man that game was tough. Glad I made it out. Hmmm, what to do next?? Aha! I’ll make an amazing drawing to flex on these failed abortions on reddit! Perfect!”
---
Good perks and killer except isolation perk. Way too strong.
---
If they want to fix it put it back as it was. 200%
---
This is The entitie's doing
---
It also makes your bar yellow, and speeds up the action even if its just a tiny bit, and yes it also tells you the killer is looking at you which can counter sneaky freddy, pig, Pearl beads spirit, Scratched mirror/T1 m&amp;a myers, cloaked wraith. If you are tired of getting 4ks, get to rank atleast 10, cause unlike rank 17s rank 10s have a semi-knowledge on how to play. It was a free weekend noobs are gonna play and be 20-16. 
---
What do you have against wraith? Wraith is... not a good killer to say the least. You’re just... not a good survivor to say the least.
---
Thanks for letting me know. Sometimes I want to msg someone (not salty msg) but just not sure who was who in the game.
---
Survivors getting skillchecks / how long it takes
---
I wonder what your definition of toxic is. 
---
times be rough 
---
I guess dbd really is a horror game 
---
you stunned me once with a flashlight. I gotta teach toxic survivors a lesson!
---
No need, seems like almost everyone running wglf just farms you when the killer is 5m away. Without borrowed time no less.
---
Imagine that from his perspective. You hear the chainsaw then 2 seconds later you see someone flying through the air towards him
---
With Balanced Landing that place is a pretty decent for survivor.....unless you're against Scratched Mirror Myers.
---
If you're killer main I'd go for doctor. M&amp;A is quite cool.
---
I can't really think of a perk from the listed survivors that are must haves. Maybe Ace for the plunderer build, as you mentioned.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** saiiyu! ^(hug)
---
git gud

Bloodhound on Hag. Because I suck at tracking sometimes and I'm always hitting bitches.

Well balance topics are linked to the overall skill of the game.  
---
When both Survivors and Killer are bad then Killer win easily.  
---
When both Surv and Killer are good then Survivor ( and especially SWF ) have an advantage. It's not, you know an iron rule, but you will witness it if you like and get better at the game.  
---
If you don't know how you cant watch popular streamer doing rank 20 to 1 as Survivor with a huge escape %age. Recently there's even one guy who did rank 20 to 1 playing only No Mither 1 .  
---
So yeah, in other words get good.
---
I am, as the killer.
---
Because Myers is trash.
---
Not a BHVR employee, sorry if I made it sound that way! Different company, less brutal games, same problems. Just felt obliged to answer as game networking has to deal with the fundamental issues of delay and UDP packet loss, especially in a P2P hosted environment. OP's footage shows a rather standard case of desync which is mostly felt by the player in such specific circumstances.

You poor bastard

That's not at all true. If you have Hex Ruin, people can't even do generators until they find that stupid totem. So everyone's running around looking for it. If you're the Hag, you can put some things down by the totem so that if anyone goes near it, you got them. 
---
Ugh. This happened to me a few weeks ago against a Freddy with 400 ping on the exact same map and in the exact same place. Reported him for hacking, but I should’ve just figured out that it was BHVR giving us a big stone cold Steve Austin middle finger.

Pretty much. Not exactly a "counter" at all and that's literally it. She can also just aim at the hook and instadown anyone that unhooks.
---
You talking shit about the engravings?
---
On PC you can. Enable Nvidia experimental features and it allows you to adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness etc.
---
You forgot the /s
---
When you play swf and no one realizes they’ve been stalked for the 5 years it takes him to get perma t3
---
yeah, loop the killer 15 sec and call my team shit? I thought it came across as im the one thats shit.
---
But you saying that implies 'X thing is OP, but is balanced because it's super rare'.
---
No, it doesn't make it balanced. Rarity should not justify how strong these add-ons/perks are.
---
No I'm not new. I just play 99% as Survivor. I have Feng and Claudette Level 50. I was Rank 5 before I quit in October because I kept levelling up but never surviving a match.
---
That's how mafia works. 
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah, people do. I know you’re thinking it’s a waste of money but everything that’s purely for entertainment kind of is, we’re in a world where people are wealthy enough to spend money on things they don’t need, and can spend it on things they want. It just means so far that the economy is doing okay. 
---
Nah shards only for me, but I appreciate the people who aren't as cheap as me helping support the game!
---
I like Tenacity and Stake Out, but hardly anyone else
---
Maybe a non-competitive mode would help combat that? (Not that the current "competitive" is *really* competitive given it's all about time spent playing rather than real skill.)
---
I had one the other day where she stepped in a bear trap from the "shute" on the game map and I saw her going for it and so I went down the stairs to meet her and pick her up. She dc the same time I picked her up from the trap and I was carrying nothing but was still able to hook nothing and get full hook/kill credit.
---
just play civ 5 instead
---
I have pig tho 
---
Hey guys im a new youtuber, I put a lot of work into this toxic dead by daylight video I really hope you enjoy it!!!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJZW-yhycRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJZW-yhycRA)
---
Thank you for your time!
---
It didn't,  but thanks for the clarification 
---
Not everyone is poor like you and can actually afford it.
---
When did I say they were balanced...
---
Did you buy the dlc, or just the character?
---
I know but this post wasn't about graphics. It implies that BHVR- instead of optimizing console only dumped a slight graphic update! 
---
If this is KYF mode, then no surprise since it has countless bugs.  But in a real match, a hex totem that could be hidden like that would cause havoc.
---
just the character, wasn't sure it mattered. TIL i guess
---
Hella
---
You either don’t have much experience as survivor or you are not good at survivor. Survivors have so many tools to escape and imo the main reason all 4 survivors die is because of the mistakes they or their teammates made
---
Yeah thats the difference. Im sure its a bug but i dont know if itll be patched
---
Saying they ultra rare implies that. And that they're okay to be available in the game.
---
The tutorial is small, has no networking, and is low in space.
---
your answer.
---
Yeah killers arent nearly as toxic as survivors or butthurt
---
Well since the game started as p2p, maybe they could switch back if they were done with dedicated servers. 
---
Def not me
---
ah what a useless offering I have then 
---
How is the killer supposed to hit you if you run away and turn corners?
---
Not fair for the killer unless the survivor runs in a straight line.
---
Fkin big mood
---
is this a joke i hope it is
---
are you seriously judging people for spending THEIR own money on what THEY want to buy? you’re the one who amazes me, really
---
It was a real match. The hex was destroyed before I got a chance to see it, but the other dull totems were also invisible. 
---
“How dare you drop a pallet on me and not just run in a straight line so I can bloodlust you to death, toxic op survivors get face camped”
---
Myer science is the best in the world!
---
Make sure that youre still obtaining perks you dont want to remove them from the. Web and increase your odds.
---
Immmmmm freeeeeaaaaking oooout maaan!!!
---
If you could see the expression on my face as I read that. I feel so fucking stupid, I’ve never thought of that before. Thanks chief, I’ll take that into consideration. 
---
What would the mori be? Maybe a facehugger impregnates the survivor and then the player can still walk around as a survivor waiting for their demise
---
Is anyone else getting really streaky pings on console(PS4)? I haven't gotten a killer today with stable connection, it will randomly go from 90ms to 340ms.
---
I'm sorry about that my dude. This meme shouldn't have been just for "console" players! 
---
I actually had that written out but didn’t include it.
---
I wanted it to be a facehugger so that way, when you were moried, your body was still laying there with the face hugger. 
---
But I settled on the extra mouth kill. A classic.
---
Flee The Facility
---
They lose their offerings but keep their items if you can’t load in
---
I like Legion too. But I never really played against him. But it's nice stabity stab vault over pallet slashity slash game playing as him. 
---
Happy to help :)
---
See, I felt like it was weak and a perk that no one would take. 
---
Because people who play Legion are either boosted or trash.
---
guacamoleniggapenis
---
Thank you! I try very hard to make good perks with obvious drawbacks!
---
Yeah it doesn’t have a lot of viewers on twitch which is concerning. Will wait to see what happens with it. 
---
So basically an unranked mode? That’s what i and a lot of other people want, and i think we’ll get that when dedicated servers come out. 
---
Haha that’s fine! I just think it’s nuts how bad the graphics situation is across the board. 
---
Keep it up!
---
More so based on the Alien movies, but the Isolation perk is definitely a nod to the game!
---
Also do you know why DBD doesn’t have voip?
---
Ugh, yeah. The rank resets fuck everything up. :\ 
---
But you can do it! 
---
The tutorial isnt multiplayer and its like 1/30th the size. Really not rocket science lol
---
Yay congrats to us ! 
---
Lerys is a map that makes bad killers better and good killers worse. Nurse, billy, and huntress have a hard time on this map due to LOS breaking and inability to chainsaw through the entire map, huntress admittedly suffers the least out of the big 3. Spirit and Myers are the exception, they’re pretty strong on those maps. 
---
It's the map with the second lowest survival percentage with first place taken by The Game. So I imagine that could be why.
---
Play FREDDY on lerys with those settings. I Dare you. I double dare you...with a cherry on top
---
Ya gotta find people to play with. Make a post about it on here, maybe people will play with ya! Or can join the DBD community page on the PS4. 
---
WGLF, Borrowed time, Deliverance and Autodidact is my build for Adam, save everyone and get the spoils of war. Sure autodidact is kinda crappy but when you get all the tokens getting people from the floor and healing after unhooking is a breeze
---
You're comparing two completely unrelated issues.
---
Nice ! 
---
One of the devs said something along the lines of “if you are disconnecting every match because of network issues then you just shouldn’t play our game” and it’s kinda true. 
---
Make a post about 4-man escape! Otherwise can message other players in game to help. 
---
This kind of math his hard enough to wrap you head around IF the distribution of shrine perks WAS random.
---
Which it very obviously isn't. It as much random as prestige III has better odds of getting better blood webs.
---
Alternatively I could just max out my gamma settings. Same thing
---
Farming def helps lol
---
Then what's your reasoning for Waterlogged shoe, Amanda's letter, tattoos middle finger, ruleset no 2, and Red Paint Brush?
---
They're all either terrible or decent, if being Ultra Rare=being OP, then everything here needs a buff, or we can admit that the rarity and the quality of the add-ons have nothing to do with each other
---
Initially, it wasnt designed with survive with friends in mind, it was supposed to be an "every man for himself" kinda thing. They added SWF later down the line due to popular demand. It isnt balanced around survivors talking to each other.
---
I'll often do a SWF but let's just say... 2 of them aren't great players lol. Plus waiting times for a 4man SWF are unbearable. :(
---
"once the devs stop supporting the game" and do what go support deathgarden? I doubt they'll ever stop supporting the only successful game they'll make.
---
I'm that person
---
I just want to point out that a particular one of those addons completely counters DS.
---
Side note - this player was dying on a hill hook with a camping pig. Poor baby! 
---
I don’t think the results are because they learned how to “play” the legion, rather this is happening because they learned how to ABUSE legion. 
---
Figured that’s why. I gotta future out emotes or something lol. 
---
How many frenzy hits does it take to down with that addon? Haven't gone up against that combo yet myself
---
Ugh, I know what you mean. :( my friends are higher ranks, so I’m carrying them at times. Maybe when the new lobby system is implemented 4-man will be easier to get through. I just constantly have us changing who invites. 
---
Well at least you fucked them good, I guess lube was too merciful? 
---
[Doctor laugh intensifies]
---
Press 1 to point at, 2 to gesture "come here"
---
We do. Usually it’s backwards. A console game has a shitty port and the PC version runs like garbage.
---
He probably didn’t down him right away,basically holding him hostage
---
Hope you reported for holding you hostage,if he blocked you for a fair amount of time
---
Cownado
---
Repost :/
---
You don’t get to evaluate if I’m a good person or not. You don’t know me.
---
Three in total.  
---
One to begin the Deep Wound timer.  
---
The second will reduce the timer to 50%.  
---
The third will down.
---
That’s really fucking stupid that it doesn’t give you the achievement when someone disconnects. Fuck that guy 
---
there was no obsession so no one had Dstrike
---
Making him tonight’s big loser.
---
Baseline, it's an incentive to get people to play killer over survivor. A more detailed answer? Survivors are essentially splitting any potential BP gains amongst themselves throughout the match with easier tasks, while the killer has to 'share' with no one on much harder ones. The points are given accordingly. 
---
I don't know why you didn't get it. I had someone DC in my adept Freddy match and I got it. It should have given you the achievement. Maybe it doesn't work the same way on consoles as it does on PC?
---
She's the last one I needed too. Disconnecting is just a dick more regardless though. It's hurts your team more than anything
---
Nope, I'm not new and I am good. I'm the problem and yet no one else can survive? Okay...
---
I've been playing since October. Man, people really don't like any criticism of this game huh?
---
People like that piss me off so much. You earned that trophy and it was taken away because some asshole got too butthurt about a loss and couldn’t take it like a man. 
---
Wrong usage of "your" versus "you're".
---
Must be a native speaker of English.
---
Maybe. I've gotten the Adept achievement with other killers when someone disconnected, but I think it might be because it was the last one?
---
I'm Level 97. The thing is though I would be matched up with equal killers whatever my rank is, but the killers always win. 
---
If you were good this post wouldn’t exist
---
depends if it crashes for you, or if the whole Session crashes 
---
You have to get Merciless as the killer and not a 4K like most people think. 
---
If a game having a few bugs is a reason not to play, good luck finding a game to play.
---
Probably already got to Rank 1 tbh
---
I told you, I'm good with the killer with no experience. You guys get so salty if someone criticizes the game.
---
Exactly. But I guess we’re gonna have to wait 6 months for this to even be addressed because it’s behavior we’re talking about. 
---
It's more of business tactic than anything
---
come every day and get a bonus rather than the game making  children digital slaves , crap this game is marketed for adults
---
and a mori too...

If you do it don't forget that the probabilities change during each chapter. 
---
I had a really bad one yesterday but it isn’t super common for me.
---
Either freddy Mike or spirit. Freddy in his lore (comic books movies etc) is stupidly powerful, being able to manipulate reality in the real world on a small scale. Each time freddy murders someone he steals their soul (as seen in the movies). A common misconception about Freddy's powers is that the asleep victim needs to be afraid for him to hurt them, that is not the case. In part 3 Nancy was NOT afraid yet freddy killed her. In freddy vs jason, Jason was not afraid either, yet still was vulnerable in the Dream world. If you've ever read the comic freddy vs jason vs ash, freddy gets the necronomicon. With the book he's almost omnipotent.
---
Michael Myers. Mike's biggest Strenght is his mind and patience. I can see Michael letting the other killers murder each other while he sits on the side lines. Michael Myers is also immortal, being able to survive pretty much everything (see H: Resurrection and H: 2 and 4 for proof)
---
Spirit I'm afraid, I don't know anything about her. But I'd say she is considerably strong based on Japanese folk lore. 
---
If she can't hear you, and you vault without scratch marks, she can't track you at all while haunting.
---
Well, Doctor's lore *is* about torturing people until they give up information, then killing them. In this case, instead of the survivors confessing to \[thing\], they just run up to you and start doing the "Come on" emote.
---
Criticizing the game is fine but the criticism actually needs to be true
---
I’ve seen people play enduring and spirit fury as well. Not that pallets are much of an obstacle for huntress but sometimes their reaction is funny when you smash throw a pallet 😂
---
Your link is broken. :( 
---
This is exactly how im having fun in this game whike trying to figure out and level other killers (i wish i was a better billy). The salt mining is icing on the cake.
---
Wasn’t trying to make it rocket science. Just find it funny how other games can get a solid 60 and this barely manages 30 on a smaller scale.

It frustrates me that I can't start a ddos attack in the last half of the game when I'm losing.  Until dedicated servers are added, my massive botnet is basically useless.
---
just buy leather face 
---
\*flashbacks to kingdom come deliverance\*
---
Hah, "a few" he says.
---
Yea it's a joke. But it is good to ask because some people in the community do have this view point.
---
The killer is a little slow in the head, so Meg is just playing along.
---
Same here, we are all running XB1X consoles what platform are you on?.
---
thank god and yea lmaoo
---
no, once the event is over you can buy them in store for cells

There was only one other person still connected in my adept doctor game

I mean this is the Steam version, not console, so yea it's fine.
---
I'm on 1X, 2 other friends on normal Xbox One.  
---
The game won’t be supported anywhere near long enough for the N to approach what is needed for the law of large numbers to apply. 
---
Even with your odds of 4% per week, there is a 35% chance BBQ and chili won’t appear in the next 26weeks, a 12% chance it won’t in the next 52 weeks, a 4.1% chance it won’t in the next 78 weeks, and a 1.4% chance it won’t in the next 104 weeks. Yes its expected value is to appear about once every half year, but it’s very possible that it won’t.
---
Caulrophobia would be just about worthless on him, no terror radius when your invisible. Nurse's, BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy butcher or shadowborn 
---
Actually I believe you might. Since for Hallowed Blight they did allow you to buy all the cosmetics with auric cells once it started. 
---
Freddy.
---
Ah, didn't realize it wouldn't be effective when invisible. Thanks for clearing that up as I didn't want to go into a match and have a redundant perk. 
---
I've had times where i removed two RBT's using the same exact box. I think when it's put on you, it randomly chooses a box
---
Imagine pc is easier to program for than consoles?
---
&gt; I think if Behavior got the liscense for Leatherface today (instead of last year)
---
Man reading is hard. You have to like, look at the screen and make sense of letters...
---
I believe you might be able to. If I recall when Hallowed Blight started you could immediately buy them with cells. 
---
Thankfully both can be countered. NOED = cleanse totems. DS = dribble/enduring. 
---
Honestly, if I see a sole survivor doing all this work, I'm not going to kill them, I'll down them and then kill everyone else and toss them in the hatch. ^Unless ^they ^teabag ^then ^they ^get ^the ^mori
---
i wish they never fixed the endgame screen showing the map instead of the postgame screen
---
they did it nonetheless
---
It is a good perk
---
Yeah, so I’d be curious to see how it would work out if the saver’s exhaustion was restored as well. 
---
Yes. Not them spinning, but mooing. The game is in dire need of more surrealism.
---
No specific date yet, but most people have speculated that it will start around the Lunar New Year, which is the first week of February.
---
Are you the Feng Min in a purple sweater that was 10 ranks higher than me because you paired with SWF &amp; then just followed me around &amp; bodyblocked me? Because I was watching you all match and wondering if you had forgotten about rancor.
---
Its possible but its more likely that it does appear than not
---
Definitely purchase him. Pretty cheap and BBQ is extremely helpful. 
---
Duh. The Wiki knows everything. Thanks.
---
I personally don’t have an issue with legion. Y’all just need to git gud.
---
Must be a strong magnet in your shoulder 
---
Yeah, I'm thinking that BVHS letting people purchase the new cosmetics as soon as they come out is a pretty good money-grab.
---
Wow, look at Kate’s new single CLIMBING the charts. 
---
Yes but some want him removed
---
 Sloppy Butcher is a much better Caulrophobia in general.
---
Beautiful.
---
Probably not 2 perks, rank 20 prob a below level 10 mike only one perk to choose from that low.
---
How do you learn and improve if you don't play?
---
Stop being a cumstain by pushing away new players.
---
Well, yes. From a gameplay point of view that makes a bit of sense (not very much, but i understand your argument).
---
From a personal perspective: This is utter bullshit. 4 People are there and investing their time. And their time should be equally valued as the one playing the killer.
---
Lets say for example freddy:
---
Freddy gets 400 (or 500?, not sure) points for putting someone to sleep. Thats literally pressing right click for a second. He gets 400 Dream Chaser Event score for hitting someone + Player found (200) Lets say thats about 1000 Bloodpoints within 7 seconds (without an addon).
---
Survivors need to do about 85% of a gen to get to around 1000 BP. Thats 68 seconds of pressing the left mousebutton and your occasional AFK check. Of course you'll get the skillcheck bloodpoints every now and then. But Hex:Ruin does actually take away survivors bloodpoints actively by not granting BPs for regular checks (which are usually 50 each). 
---
As a doc you get 150BP if you hit someone with your shock. Thats 12 seconds on the gen. Which takes you 2 seconds to do, CAN hit multiple people and be done pretty much 2-3 times in one go. (Plus other things).
---
Additionally the survivors don't really have much influence if they will recieve a lot of bloodpoints. If the killer is a total doofus and doesn't make out to hook a single person, survivors will be left with 1 1/2 categories that they can actually get bloodpoints in. Which are Lightbringer (5x 1250 -&gt; 6250 Bloodpoints total) + 5000 Escape. No altruism (no ones hooked/injured) and one person (who loops for 5 gens) will have 8000 in Evader and 5000 in Escape. Means One person will leave with 13000 Bloodpoints, while the other ones have to share 6250 -&gt; 2000 BPs each + 5000 Bps Each (escape). The result would be 13000 | 8000 | 8000 | 8000  (1000 each added for totems).
---
While on the other hand the killer will probably (even without a hook) have about 15000-22000 Points accumulated by breaking pallets, and chasing around and the occasional use of their special ability (be it shock from doc or sth else, traps etc.) and this is JUST A BAD KILLER!
---
Now take a good killer that goes out of each and every match with 25000 bloodpoints (average) with BBQ&amp;C. Thats 50k bloodpoints within a game. While survivors each make about 15k (avg) and thats by Being chased, unhooking, healing, doing gens, doing totems, opening exit gates, exiting the match). Even if they take WGLF (4 Stacks -&gt; 100%) theres 8 Possible unhooks. Which means every person could MAYBE get 50% extra (on avg). Which would mean the average survivor gets 22,5k (with a perk that doesn't serve ANY PURPOSE but bloodpoints) while the killer gets BP free for doing his objective and gets a nice cherry on top.
---
Survivors right now have VERY VERY little bloodpoints to spend. Leveling characters as a Survivor main is tedious. It takes 2-4 games for a decent survivor to get one lvl 50 bloodweb done. Thats the real grind.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My personal view: Yes, I know the killer has "more to do". But the killer is still JUST PLAYING THE GAME. They are doing their objective while survivors are doing their objective. If one is harder than the other, i don't care. But the time they put in should be equally valued. Either lower the killers BP income or raise the survivors' income.
---
Before now someone starts on: "But killers need addons for their games, survivors don't". The lovely streamers of Tru3talent and no0b3 have shown you that killers even WITHOUT PERKS AND ADDONS can get to rank one and play there without a problem.
---
Addons make your life easier, but are not a necessary thing. Also survivors can lose their items and their Addons. And theres a 'You will now drop 13k Bloodpoints'-Perk (Franklin's), thats a whole survivor game.
---
TL;DR: Killers recieve overly much compared to survivors, by just playing their objective.  
---
What you're actually struggling with is seeing that those two probabilities don't tell you anything about the next coin flip. In fact, you must know that the next coin flip is still 50/50, so there's a 50 percent chance of 101/0 H/T just like there is a 50 percent chance of 55/46 H/T. That's why we don't know if a Tail flip is coming soon or not. We should be as confident that it will come up next as we were the first 100 flips, not more and more confident the longer we don't see it.
---
So let me straighten this out,
---
You've countered what he said about ds having no counterplay with "Look at this other thing! What counter does that have!?" and when he said a completely sensible "it has no counterplay," you attack his belief on DS with that?
---
Ds and ebony hatchets and all that other stuff with little to no countering can all be stupid. They don't have to be mutually exclusive.
---
All it does is stop discussion on why a perk or otherwise is bad for the game, and starts turning it into a contest of throwing whatever we deem OP into the ring and pointing at it.
---
**DMC: Devil May Connect**
---
I’m a wraith main and I use ruin, sloppy, whispers, and either bamboozle or nurse’s depending on the type of games I’ve been getting. When I want to try hard I use both “all seeing” add ons to see survivors through walls as well as generator progress. 
---
Only one way to get better!
---
It doesn’t take less skill to play killer, if anything it takes more. Lol what? There’s so much micromanaging that you have to do as killer that sometimes, it’s more stressful than it is fun. You’re probably just upset that one of your fellow survivors did something stupid and got you killed. 
---
Enduring actually makes all stuns recovery 75% faster, not reduce the stun time. The formula is (stun recovery time) / 1.75 instead of (stun duration) - 75%
---
Galaxy Brain is using Claudette is the most non-stealthy outfit. 
---
Fuck Freddy. Only cucks play as him
---
It is! But in a way it’s nice for those who are too busy to play during the event! 
---
You just pretty much beat-for-beat match the reviews people who had 10 hours in this game made.
---
I'm letting you know.
---
Cant see your add ons, but I'm sure one of those you equipped is the one that wont Insta-Down when hitting with the chainsaw.
---
...to some people on this subreddit, he's got a bigger blade. :D :D :D
---
Kinda unrelated but why is this game capped at 60 fps? It hurts my eyes
---
Oh fuck off with that gatekeeping horseshit. If you're upset with someone turning off chat then you're the pussy
---
I just can't stand playing against him
---
[removed]
---
It literally takes the same amount of skill to play either, if anything the killer is more of a challenge due to it being solo but in that same token, being a survivor is just as challenging due to having to somewhat rely on the other 3 to actually do something 
---
If you’re going to post stupid things please stop posting 
---
Why did you censor the auric cells?

Adrenaline.

I mean it's not a scam by any means, but nothing else is really a lie.

---
*Gens you, doing?*
---
We're best friends.
---
Especially with the disgrace that legion is
---
True team players.
---
What do you mean it takes less skill to play killer? Killer is hecka stressful, and much harder as survivor. Let people play the game, if they aren't good that's fine, they're probably having fun, like you should learn to.
---
I mean he got some mad bloodpoints and most likely safety pipped with "Brutal Killer", what should he complain about. Some killers expect a 4k every game. :/
---
No. I was a casUAL LAURIE WITH A MED KIT FOR HELPING MY FRIENDS, THEN GOT CHASED FOR 3/4 OF THE GAME, UNTIL THE END WHERE I GOT ＭＯＲＩＥＤ．
---
not everyone is competitve in this game lmao, just play swf instead of w randoms
---
Discounted LF + SAW Chapter + NOES Chapter + Base Game = $49
---
Yeah I’ll have to do that :)
---
That was my first thought as well
---
Rancor. Never pick them up, never hook them, eat away at their will as you kill ALL their friends, picking them up, putting them on hooks... not the obsession, theyll watch the game from their bellies. Plus, at the end you can outright kill your obsession without ever hooking them in the first place, or picking them up at all, or possibly getting hit by DS.
---
You could even ignore them, but they do become an objective for the team at that point.
---
Thanks!! And congrats to you too :) 
---
Yep pre-clown they tried and gave proper clothing distinction now it's just lame ass recolors, at the very least they better keep giving a 2nd outfit for licensed characters since they can't do store cosmetics for them (non lame ass recolored outfits)
---
OH FAIR. That sucks then :( Sometimes it's super unfair.
---
I literally just before your post went up, pulled a rancor move on a rank 5 Feng that bodyblocked me the whole match, so I was like, 'I swear to God, if it's the same person.........'
---
Dope style! Would it be possible for you to do one of Myers? :P 
---
Why in God's name would you get 3 people on 1 gen at the start?
---
That'll get you 1 gen done in over maybe a minute, as opposed to 3 gens done in a minute and 20 seconds.
---
Are you sure you're good at the game, and not just boosted?
---
Yup such skill that legion showed, much better than the meg they were chasing no doubt. Perfectly fun and fair killer right there
---
Can’t use SB on wraith tho because of the bug unfortunately..
---
He's ashamed of himself for supporting the developers.
---
The devs are incapable of balancing their current game the thought of them trying to make other games with the same level of incompetence at balance and community communication is scary.
---
I think it’s worse that you de pip if the killer dc’s 
---
If you're bad at reddit, please stop posting OP
---
Honestly, just use facebook instead, it takes less intelligence
---
It just feels weird to say flipping heads 100 consecutive times is just as probable as flipping a 55/45 H/T distribution when I don’t feel like that’s what you would ever observe if you ran that experiment.
---
The number is below 1000 if that matters.
---
Sploosh.
---
i didn't want everyone to know how much money i'm put into this dumbass game :pensive: 
---
I'm number one and I still get hate from killers lmao.
---
I got DBD for free on PS plus
---
I buy all chapters and fengs Christmas sweater and the charity case and Susie (legion cosmetic) but that's all
---
All killers are hard to use against goof survivors
---
Both counters are so half assed they're not even actual counters. I'm not gonna want to run Enduring just to counter DS. And "cLeAnSe tHE tOtEMs" shouldn't even be a thing. Miss one totem and NOED still happens + the amount of time you wasted looking for the others.
---
You don’t need NOED on Myers unless you’re using perma tier 1 or 2 addons 
---
Strange because I see rank 18 killers with tier 3 perks all the time. Does that make them "sweaty?" The tier of the perk doesn't determine the ability or rank of the player. In fact, the ranking system in this game is a joke to begin with. Rank doesn't determine player skill. I can be the rank 20 survivor in your lobby and make you look like a fool with just tier 1 balanced landing on Nea as a perk.
---
They need to fix that pallet thing... 
---
Nah dog keep that shit away from me lmao *nearest locker pls*
---
I mean you are on the sub so it’s kinda of implied you have most of the dlcs and probably at least 5$ in auric cells so...
---
Can we get a graphics *downgrade?*
---
I'd much rather be able to play the fucking game, than admire the scenery, thank you. &lt;3 
---
At least let us turn off/down particles.
---
r/woooosh
---
I’m on the sub and I haven’t spent anything...
---
A good Myers usually uses an end game build, such as blood warden, remember me, noed, and ruin because his beginning game is super slow, especially against good survivors. I’ve learned just expect all gens to get finished, and get as many hooks as possible during game. 
---
Oh, I’m talking about myself.
---
found the legion player
---
I read the word favorite and I knew exactly what was gonna happen but I was still surprised.
---
i am way too impatient to do that, i spend bloodpoints immediately 
---
I read that as "he's black", checked image again and noticed he is indeed kinda brown
---
Thats not saying a lot hah
---
Got the game for free. Bought all the dlc and my favorite costume for wraith trapper hillbilly nurse spirit legion huntress doctor Jeff and nea. So ten bucks for each plus the extra ten because you have to buy the whole legion cast.
---
Strictly because of the non prestige claudette I have? Yeah, ok.
---
There are no double pallets that aren’t exclusive to certain maps. As far as my memory serves the game is the only prominent example of this. 
---
I get ill playing this on ps4. Until it's fixed I can't continue to enjoy it.
---
You made it sound like they were completely gone
---
But doing snipe doctor with Interview tape and an electrode so you can zap from 30+ meters away is so much fun. :( 
---
No why?
---
nice!!! i'm 75% of the way there, the only one i'm really worried about getting is the four man hatch escape ugh. if anyone wants to get a group together and go for it on ps4, hmu 8')
---
Okay now do short hair on every woman character.
---
Spirit included. 👀
---
Isn’t her terror radius 32 meters? 
---
NOED can be countered (by breaking a total of 5 totems, wow so many). DS cant be countered unless you count enduring as a counter which is situational, because it doesnt matter whether you have enduring and you catch someone on hatch or next to an open exit gate, you're screwed.
---
Point is, noed can be easily destroyed and countered before it can even be used, ds can be used whenever you want and is a get out of jail free card.
---
Yea and did you see those next level mind games!?!?! Pretending to get pallet stunned and pretending to lose you all so you’d bleed out right in front of them..... WHAT.A.GOD
---
I started playing more survivor swf and holy shit I’ve run into so many entitled/cocky/bad survivors. And trying to explain to them why what happened, happened they get so offended. You can tell when they spend 90% of their playtime on survivor and don’t empathize with the killer at all
---
You have to read and write these things carefully. I said that given there have been 100 heads there is still a 50 percent probability there will be 101/0 and 100/1. Given there have been 54 heads there is still a 50 percent probability that you will flip again and have 55. How many heads doesn't tell you what's going to happen "soon".
---
Another way of looking at it that might help is what you're currently arguing is that given a larger and larger number of trials the chance that there are 0 tails goes down. That much is true, but you have to remember that we don't approach the ideal distribution systematically or predictably. So those probabilities don't tell you when the next tail will happen or that it's going to happen "soon". Tails don't need to start "catching up" with heads because it's getting closer and closer to 200 flips and you still only have heads.
---
Another important thing to keep in mind is that perks aren't coin flips. The napkin math of chances of 100 Heads is .5^100 or what might be fairly called "fuckin' nothin'". The chance that BBQ won't be in the shrine in a 52 week period is (making a few assumptions to make it simpler on me) [1- (1 BBQ / (3 perks * 13 killers))]^52 or about 25.9%. 
---
ur worrying about going above 60 fps while console players are wondering why their frame rate is capped at 15fps rofl
---
Doing gens, you?
---
What bug?
---
Anything that causes him to lose
---
They usually announce event start days so them dropping it unexpectedly tomorrow is not how they usually do it. 
---
Probably an announcement this week for next week.
---
I've spent entire games cleansing totems. In the time it took me to find four the gens pop. I missed the last one because Im the only one trying to stop it because I know it's coming. I have a whole build around stopping noed. I agree there is a counter. But that whole game I didn't get much for points. I hope survivors do learn to stop complaining about game mechanics and get on shit.
---
Nah man it was obviously 15. He couldn't pip at all till our man Frank gave him that extra assistance. 
---
I see what your coming from and I agree with what you've said. I didn't mean for what i said to come off as "your wrong ds is usable and not broken!!!!" It's just that he says every "ds can't really be countered except for juggling" but there are killer addons/perks that can't be countered aswell. I just find stupid that the mindset is "killer perks are overpowered and uncountable" or "survivor perks are overpowered and uncountable" and never "both sides have some bullshite on their side"
---
You have to get merciless killer. I got it on legion with only two kills. Points are what you are going for.
---
No it’s not a WiFi issue, I’m running a 100mb wired connection and every asshole killer who plays the wraith and running sloppy butcher, you get the constant blood squirt after being hit. The blood squirt didn’t stop after being healed and it messes the hole game up with bad frame rate, to where it kicks everyone from the match. If the INCOMPETENT DEVS would take sloppy butcher away until they can fix the issue it would solve THE PROBLEM! 
---
NoEd
---
Totems can spawn in impossible to find spots and ds can only be used once, you can noed people until you get hand cramps
---
The survivor relies on killers to make mistakes because the KILLER IS FASTER THAN THEM. That's why mindgames and jukes exist. If both players play perfectly, in theory, the survivor will always go down. On the other hand, if the killer is shit, a survivor that is top-tier could run them around forever.
---
You learn to apply pressure in other ways. Ruin is a wasted perk slot imo. 
---
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
---
Sometimes I bodyblock survivors until all the gens are done then down them with noed and let them crawl to freedom :)
---
You should find friends to play with lmao . 
---
The fact that a killer needs ad-ons to win means they are weak.
---
Burn offerings for maps with less jungle gyms? 
---
Playing nurse on console ... 
---
These fuckers lool, I hope it was quick and painless
---
The merciless requirement is back from when getting a merciless meant getting a 4k. I've seen posts here where people got a merciless when they were going for the achievement and they were mad that they didn't get it, because they didn't actually get a 4k.
---
Can't you get platinum on the ps4 version without getting every achievement in the game (including dlc ones?)
---
PC achievements are harder too, because some of the more brutal ones require more amounts to be done.
---
But yeah, I have 100% of the achievements in the PC version. Takes me about a week or two to get back after every new chapter.
---
Because you have to be equal skill in the games you play to be friends irl
---
No ed
---
Exactly my standpoint. He is very problematic yes, but I really like his spooky, albeit generic design.
---
I mean, any help counts. When you are leveling up thousands of times for the ad-ons you want that extra chance even if it is little.
---
I found it funny op. Good work. 
---
If for some reason the survivors are insisting on sticking around despite the exit gates being powered. 
---
Can't wait for the killers complaining about never finding matches because there ping is too high when Dedicated Servers come out.
---
Can instantly kill a survivor from full health. Can't lunge to kill them though. It also increases the amount of evil required to reach evil within 3.
---
My built up anger? You are the one ranting about shitty teammates. And no I’ve only played killer 10 times so get your facts straight salty mcdumbshit. I mainly play survivor, but clearly your cheeks are so chaffed from the clapping that you need to push off your insecurities  about your anger issues off on others, and rant about teammates that aren’t “up to your level” which shit if you are a Rank 3 and are bitching about rank 20s you have more problems just then your anger insecurities. Your whole life is fucked, take your stupid dumb dumb bubble gum ass on to a different subreddit where your stupidity will be accepted. 
---
Joke answer in the tune of "[that's amour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnFlx2Lnr9Q)": It's when the hatchet hits your eye, that's a mori~
---
Serious answer: Mori is the short for [Memento Moris](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Memento_Moris) which is either an add on you can burn or a perk that lets you kill the survivors. 
---
Even more mind games by darkening my screen so much I could hardly see where they were

Played against some survivors once. One of them than a BPS. That person was my first and second hook, and I downed him a third time, but let him bleed. I would have felt bad for him if I outright killed him like I usually do. Take care of the survivors that being in BPS.
---
Yeah, PS4 has more leeway for trophies. To get a 100% you can do the original game’s trophies. And then the additional chapters are separate. But even if you 100% the additional, I don’t recall them being platinums too, just gold or silver trophies. Spider-Man game was the same way with its DLC. 
---
No because I suck as killer :(. Congrats though!
---
This shit happens to me allllll the time, and they obviously have to be super obnoxious during the whole thing, like just being massively better isn't enough.
---
*laughs in Freddy*
---
Legion will most likely get a numbers tweak. An actual rework won't be coming until 2021 assuming this game still exists that is. Hell, the hag and trapper "reworks" are still pretty fresh and they predate Legion by years.
---
Thanks!
---
Video game killer bad
---
Ah but we're not playing this game for its graphics, we're playing because there isn't another viable asymmetrical multiplayer akin to it...
---
DS can be saved for a better moment to use it. NOED is a hex perk and can be removed from the match before you can even use it. Your point is?
---
lol found the rustler of jimmies.
---
It is possible, but claiming it takes "no skill" is ridiculous. A fresh rank 20 casual isn't going to shoot straight up to rank 1 within a few hours of playing, even if they stick with one Killer. If you have over 150 hours of frequent playtime, you'll eventually accumulate the knowledge and skill required to get to rank 1 without trying as hard as you usually do.
---
&lt;3
---
Instructions not clear, on way to ER with stroke symptoms 
---
Once you pick up the survivor and they get ds, its not that hard to get them again. If ds is so troublesome to you because you can't track the survivors then that's on you. Survivors only use DS when they're bad and get caught a lot.
---
Seeing "TTV" in their name made me not want to read their comment. 
---
If I saw this going on as the killer, I'd have just stopped and watched. Survivors can do the gens, I got something to keep me entertained til they leave.
---
Ah thanks, been taking a break from wraith but that's good to know.
---
Don't laugh at my loadout, I don't have enough hours in to get the good teachable perks lol
---
100% your decision to do that. If they were injured of you were chasing there sure. But you decided to stand there and thats on you.
---
Paid for Leatherface, Halloween chapter, Curtain Call, Shattered Bloodlines, and Legion individually.
---
Then I spent only enough on I think $5 worth of Auric Cells for Clown cosmetics. 
---
Exactly. There's no need to taunt me at both exit gates cuz you gamed the system. Just take your massive W and be happy with it
---
People who are toxic online are probably the same asshats who don't tip their wait staff and piss on toilet seats in public washrooms. Fuck 'em.
---
It's less than 1%, which is so far inside the margin of error that it's statistically irrelevant. Even if it is real and not just a chance offset less than 1 more per 100 webs isn't worth the extra grind.
---
Woah, this is really good, now I actually want to see something of an Alien DLC, although that would be quite hard to happen. Anyways, great job op!
---
Oh they're sick of playing the holy trinity. 
---
2.8 hours total.
---
I understand deranking. There's a lot of reasons playing in Red rank sucks, and the game basically forces it on you whether you're ready for it or not. So given the choice between de-ranking and, say, not playing until after the 13th I can't blame someone for just deranking.  It just sucks that their de-ranking effects my games.
---
A lot of people say Rank 1 Rewards. I think that'd be cool, but I don't know if it'd really fix the problem. The problem of "I'm not having fun and I hate this" still exists. 
---
Everyone else going to ignore the survivor with 1400 points? Did you tunnel him to death or did he suicide on hook?
---
Of course it's *more* likely but your argument about convergence is nonsense here. 
---
&gt;Eventually, the odds will converge and BBQ will appear and with the number of trials we've had it should be soon.
---
You are doing the equivalent of sitting at a roulette table and saying that because 0 hasn't shown up in the past 100 spins that we are due for one soon. That is not how probability works and you underestimate just how large the N has to be for us to expect convergence.
---
Git gud tbh, you don't even need perks that much with certain killers 
---
Holy shit. This is actually a pretty solid killer idea. The second perk’s radius definitely needs to be shortened and the aura time raised up a little but other than that right on. If only the devs at least considered fan ideas, this community has come up with some fantastic ideas, ideas like this one.
---
Would totally be a Gravewarden main my dude. 
---
Sometimes you have to get away from life by playing a video game. Trust me. Without a game that can be played endlessly and still have progression and can still be fun it would be terrible. Especially with people who have anxiety or depression. Escaping reality by playing and endless game can save a life.
---
this is fine
---
They recently buffed NOED, what does this tell you? Maybe the perk is not as broken as everybody on this sub thinks it is? DS will get the nerfbat in due time, no matter how much you meme about it.
---
Pink addons/offerings can go fuck themselves though, just scrap all of them. Nobody likes playing against them and most of the time you use them just to piss the other side off.
---
I actually don't want any more licensed killers unless they can get cosmetics
---
You missed an opportunity to have the Director from TF2 be a killer.
---
I can’t tell if I’m crying or laughing 
---
Welcome to solo play.
---
Yes I can't wait to see one of the most iconic threats to mankind; agile, fast, incredibly strong and blood made of deadly acid to be stunned and looped around a piece of wood and afraid of flashlights carrying its prey to a bloody hook before slowly shambling to spend more time pretending not to smell every survivor and instead banging its hands on machines it has no understanding of.
---
How about **NO**
---
I didn't think that stream promotion was allowed here? I clicked on the link and thought it was a clip but nope. 
---
I don't think it's wrong, but I don't entirely agree with it. There are situations where killers can goad Survivors into making mistakes. To me, the difference between an average player and a great player is that the great player can push Survivors into making mistakes.   Expert Spirit players are good at it, but I've seen every killer from Wraith to Freddy pull out some damn good moves.
---
Which we should consider to be the default scenario
---
I feel like people should see the sarcasm but honestly, sometimes in this sub you really never know...
---
Doc is also slowed down while charging his zaps, but its different in a few ways. It affects the entirety of the Terror Radius (with no addons), but doesnt come with auxilary affects like illusions or messed up skillchecks
---
They're similar, but they have their differences.
---
Alright let's do what I always do:
---
Survivor perk 1 - It'll sadly never happen and Boil Over proves that. They won't add a perk to help with wiggling for a long time. A perk that makes hook stages last longer could be interesting though, and could server as a sort-of counter to camping. If it made hook stages progress slower and had another effect (not the struggle time) then I could easily see it added.
---
Survivor perk 2 - So Spides in the Shadows for Survivor? I think it's certainly an interesting concept but it's perhaps a little too strong to essentially have a token-based Object of Obession. Perhaps if it produced the loud notification for both you and the Killer (but range that the Killer hears is decreased based on perk level) it would be more balanced.
---
Survivor perk 3 - Sprint Burst in front of your ally before running away, then both of you get Adredaline. GG EZ SWF Killer goes and drinks bleach. Risks being insanely OP in SWF and downright worthless otherwise. Doubling MS after a bodyblock is probably way too strong.
---
Killer perk 1 - Interesting concept that's good for the likes of Doctor. Helps slow the game down. Debatably a more effective version of a perk like Fired Up.
---
Killer perk 2 - Deep Wounds would be OP. Maybe damaging them or slowing them would be fine. I think setting a limit to the number of pallets (perhaps token related, with higher level giving more tokens) would make it balanced.
---
Killer perk 3 - Increasing movement speed for being in a lone chase would be nonsense. Basically guarentees a kill in the late game among other things. I'd honestly say an inverse of this perk would be more balanced but I understand that you want to stick to the theme. Maybe just stick to lunge distance.
---
Killer power - So it's Pig 2.0? The description is very weird and could use a second draft, but having essentially a Pig Hillbilly hybrid would be strange.
---
Overall I give this concept a 6/10. Got some unique ideas but they're rather poorly balanced and very weird overall.
---
TydeTyme is a TERRIBLE killer, he even says so himself. I wouldnt agree with anything he says about any part of the game because his anger just overcomes all of his opinions. That's my point.
---
You use noed...
---
My feeling on it is that there are a variety of killers for a reason. If you join 10 games and 9 of those are the same killer (not the same player), it's annoying. It doesn't even have to be a particularly strong killer. It could be 4 Freddies in a row and I'd reconsider playing a 5th game.
---
And the important point you're missing is that instead of lobby skipping, people are just DCing. I could have been teamed with someone who has some skills or at least some balls, but no, I'm down a teammate because they heard a gong.
---
As for killer lobby skipping, why not? Toxic survivors, SWF, or a team full of Claudettes is probably just as tiresome to repeatedly play against.
---
I honestly don't understand why some killer addons exist. Why does Huntress need instadown ranged attacks? Why should killer be able to either instantly kill a survivor as soon as he is caught or even after being hooked once?
---
The only reason I can think of why these add-ons exist is that they simply are means for the player playing killer to relieve frustration and stress from previous games. Unfortunately this frustration is only transferred to the players on receiving end and vicious cycle continues.
---
I feel like the developers of this game are extremely sadistic people. It's as if the game is designed in such a way which attempts to bring the worst out of people. It FEEDS on misery and frustration. And then people are so dumbstruck why community is so toxic.
---
Isnt "Not like this" just a straight out better Boil Over?
---
And thats my point. Im not talking about TT my man. Im talking about people like Monto, DamnNoHtml, Noob3, ect.
---
THAT DEMO'S A BLOODY SPY!
---
Honestly I have a really hard time on Legion-- I prefer most other killers to them. 
---
I've spent hundreds of hours at Rank 1 and have used Dead Hard and Sprint Burst a solid amount of time at those ranks. I much prefer DH but that's just me. Opinions are just opions 🤷‍♀️.
---
In my mind, it’s what Boil Over should have been. 
---
Sorry you feel that way! Hope you can enjoy the concept nonetheless!
---
Dont use legion and moonwalk, dont use moris, dont use iridescent heads, dont use tombstone, dont use tuft of hair, dont use Frank's mixtape and cold dirt, dont use NOED. 
---
I was worried that having a larger terror radius is counter-productive to the power. I dunno, good point though, especially if the power didn’t just get rid of the terror radius but had it fade away like it’s leaving. 
---
Who wouldn't?
---
I'm so sorry, I feel you man
---
Thank you! I wasn’t too sure about the Alien’s power, but I tried to adapt my original idea to work without having to add too many new mechanics. 
---
I can’t wait to see the Alien moonwalk. 
---
Downvoted because legion.
---
camps the guy running calm spirit and iron will 
---
It's a show Parks and Rec
---
Agreee. I don’t use any of those things lol 
---
SAME, all these posts about cOnSoLe PlAyErS have SUCH LOW FPS1!!1!1! and then there's me with my shitty PC that literally goes down to 20fps on some maps. It doesn't sound bad, but it's awful because it means I can't 360, hit great skill checks consistently or hit my DS
---
What perks do you run? I'm trying to find some good ones for legion.
---
Ofc you'd use sloppy, why wouldnt you abuse a bug
---
I read the title and knew exactly what was gonna be in the comments
---
Can confirm. This Hag downed me before the last gen popped. Put down traps around my body. Waited for the last gen to pop and mori'd me. Few people are just try hards to the core. Can't help it.
---
Cool. Not like this has been posted 20+ times in the past 2 days.
---
Yikes
---
Uhh, [you mean this?](https://i.imgur.com/pK0LTVQ.png) 
---
On console it's more like a bug that happens to have a game attatched
---
Still better of an affect in 1000s of webs. 
---
Do you mean Wake Up!
---
They're not going to be healing if you're chasing them
---
Done
---
Give me your steam account info and I will add you
---
They're literally using a perk that is commonly used on killers, especially Wraith.
---
Suppose that's fair
---
I got the game for free and have since spent over £300, not including the things that people have bought for me. Just buy LF, he's cheap as fuck and BBQ is so worth it.
---
he's not very good without add-ons, but with add-ons he's probably mid-tier
---
Yep, that checks out. Never knew that.
---
wtf
---
That's what I was thinking!!
---
A man can dream
---
I'm talking about the people who experience ANY lag at all and just go "oh he's cheating" and blow up the post game with their diarrhea salt even if they win.
---
I mean, Freddy is basically a demigod in his universe, and he fits into the game just fine, albeit a bit weak. I believe they said in terms of lore that the entity "nerfs" the killers in some aspects, because without doing so the survivors would never feel hope, which it feeds off of. 
---
There's already a perk that you can use as a survivor that let's you do gens faster if you're the last alive. It's not used very often by a lot of people and that's because it's pretty useless because the hatch is a thing. Just sayin.
---
Yeah it’s pretty stupid if you ask me. What’s even laughable is that the recolor you get is so similar that when I buy the chapter I can’t even tell which top was the original after I switch it. Especially with Adam. There’s such a minute difference when we all know damn well his denim outfit was supposed to come with the dlc. Same thing with Kate and hell even JEFF for fucks sake Jeff came out with TWO outfits in the store. Really? Like you guys already have a premium outfit for him made why put both of his unique outfits in the store....rant over sorry. 
---
I mean, yeah. If the killer has shit connection then I'll usually flame them for having shit connection, not for cheating.
---
$100+
---
Why you gotta make Billy Boy sad? That’s messed up bro! 😭

Yay that's awesome!! I hope to see you in the Fog someday &lt;3

Ever heard of kill your friends before? It's this cool feature that lets you do exactly what you're complaining about. Access to all perks and items with full use of all the add-ons for those items and get this, you ready for it? You have full access to every type of offering. Much wow.
---
I see this a lot actually. 
---
I am realizing them my guy. Im not saying DH cant do those things, of which are incredibly helpful, but so situational. The only situation youll see more than a handful of times, is using it for loop distance, which then only works perfectly on non-dropped pallet loops, instead of window loops. For window loops, youll need to be at the perfect distance to dh, and have enough space to vault without being hit. Same goes for an already dropped pallet. Too close to the vault, dh is useless and you dh into the window/pallet. Too far, and you dont have the spacing to stop the killer from just catching back up to hit you, now with a lunge.
---
I think it's just the right timing, like pulling someone off ther window or a pallet 
---
Now get ready for this. I’m not going to be asking my friends to play practice every time I want to try out a new killer. 
---
dont lunge, you have be right next to them and tap m1. It's the same for when survivors vault windows and pallets as well.
---
Quick hit, not a lunge, I believe
---
In universe though, getting impregnated basically means you should bend over and kiss your ass goodbye, no real way of getting them out once implanted. It might fit better as a mori, but the alien has a lot of other cool kills competing for that, like the tail skewer and the second mouth. 
---
In that it's actually pretty good and underrated? If so, yeah.
---
People doesn't always have friends to play with, you know 
---
A bug? I’m unfamiliar with a bug pertaining to sloppy lol
---
Clown bottles are insanely easy to peg survivors with, even at rank 1. People run in straight lines. That said, unless you're running pinky finger, it's generally best not to throw the bottle *at* the survivor
---
Happy cake day owo
---
You can also just stand on the hatch and deny them 2k in points. I have done this a few times, while making myself a coffee.
---
Seriously, Whenever I get hit with DS I just go "Oh, guess I gotta chase him again" (Which if you don't like chasing don't play killer cus that's literally the game)
---
This is the best way ive seen this said. 
---
The quote is from a Noob3 video. He ran the killer around for like 20 minutes but the only other surivor alive, the Claudette in his team, only did 1 gen throughout that. When the match ended, he asked what she was doing and the Claudette responded "Doing gens, you?"
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks I hate it. 
---
You don't. It says you do ingame, but people have posted threads before with stats that demonstrated that there's no noticeable difference between a normal bloodweb and a p3 bloodweb.
---
Calm yo tits bro, we get it.
---
Well when you compare the textures of dinosaurs to Nea it’s pretty night and day. Shadows and lighting make zero sense in dbd. Half the game just looks like it’s painted on a wall. Half the time I enter a locker my legs are sticking out. Kate Climbing up walls like spiderman sounds perfectly normal. And the game only has to load in 5 ppl vs what like 70 
---
“MOO”
---
“Stop it Patrick you’re scaring him!”
---
Oh shi, that was posted like 3 weeks ago right? 
---
Also dont forget that some a-hole might blow servers up while youre playing so no servers would be better
---
Hmm, very good looping spot, typically with a gen and chest nearby, the survivors will never find it.
---
That's actually really cute
---
I think so
---
I hear this image
---
Yeah, makes you wonder which side he plays.
---
Parks and recreation, I highly suggest you watch it.
---
okay i’d say more 80%.
---
3...
---
Cold Dirt on top of it makes it crazy powerful.
---
Myers with tier 3 is scary. Especially when he misses the first time and downs you the second. 
---
He stalk, moonwalk, but doesn’t talk. 
---
Is this just taking the image file for each survivor and renaming to killer files, and vise versa?
---
What do you not get that some don’t want to play with real people? Lol. But sure draw it for me. 
---
Good thing about low ranks: people who use DS are shit, so you just down them in 7-10 seconds lmao.
---
Then find a different game to play because you'll always be playing with and against real people in this game.
---
She would like Dwight since he looks like a little bitch. 
---
Honestly I don’t understand the Legion disconnect memes. Here on console I haven’t been getting any
---
How are people this fucking stupid.
---
He's back in black and white. :D
---
Thanat is rly bad. It’s only a 2.82% penalty if all 4 are injured. It’s not worth a perk slot. Sloppy is 100% better. 
---
On console too? Cuz if that's true then people are trash at hitting DS skill check
---
SHITSTORM INCOMING
---
I love how Meg stops to watch too this is hilarious
---
I just take the skeletal animations and swap them. 
---
And? Once it is used in the match it’s gone. To me it’s an absolutely useless perk.
---
BBQ, Stridor, Discordance, Moniter and Abuse
---
These have been working wonders for me. I’m still getting 4Ks at these lower ranks, but I expect that to stop up high. 
---
Against high ranking survivors he’s pretty powerless. 
---
What happen when u tbag dbd dev as killer?
---
Watch this https://youtu.be/R98e-Y4Lu8w
---
A Claudette who hadn't seen the killer the entire game. Why am i not surprised /s
---
I’m gonna bet a dollar that this is some kid’s mother that walked into their child’s room when they were playing Dead By Daylight
---
I swear it felt like the last five Wraiths I played against were laggy as shit. 
---
Nope. No blood, unless you have an Ultras Rare, and you lose all aura reading abilities.
---
He looks *tilted*
---
This achievement is literally why i stopped going for 100% it is so opposite to my playstyle to hookrush. And you kave to hope that the killers goes after you and not the unhooked survivor. Also the Text is super misleading. 
---
There are people that are beyond saving 
---
Tbh I think the concept and lore is cool af but he needs a rework
---
Probaply a F13 dev
---
No doctor giggle? For shame
---
What add-ons do you use?
---
The legion is the least fun killer to play against. You have to accept you are going to go down unless you can lose the legion somehow. He ignores windows, ignores pallets, and with the right ad-ons can finish a chase in less time than any other killer except nurse.
---
No ™️, I'm disappointed. 
---
All I want is for them to dumb it down and use imperial measurements! I have no idea what 40 meters is. I don’t even know how to guesstimate that! Give me feet or yards please!
---
So you decided to DC... smfh
---
Wow can you go back to the past by playing thay late? They are using things like BNP and odd bulb in a really strange way
---
Sometimes a vaultpoint is unvaultable for the legion, its a weird glitch. I've only ever come across it on this one pallet in the pale rose. 
---
&gt; use bloodlust to your advantage. 
---
Don't encourage bloodlust as if it's the best mechanic in the game, bloodlust should really only be done on unsafe tiles. There's too many people working hard to get bloodlust 2-3 just to get a hit, it's simply not worth it.
---
Monto isn't that good at killer tbh. He respects pallets 90% of the time and makes a lot of misplays. Plus he only picks games where he gets rank 20 survivors. 
---
*Chainsaw intensifies....*
---
&gt; don't respect the pallets. just go swing through them 
---
Better to walk through them since swinging only works against survivors who camp pallets.
---
I like 50/100/150/200 idea. 
---
I never said it was the best mechanic. All i sair is use it. At tier 1 bloodlust you're more likely to land a hit through a pallet than you are with no bloodlust
---
I have about 400 hours in the game but I stay around rank 11 because I don't want to face Nurse and Billy over and over again. Boring killers. Plus there's nonreward for ranking up so what is the point.
---
I for one want to buy a game, play it for a few hours, then complete forget about it! Or better yet, get a game and then never play it!
---
Ouch. I see your point.
---
The timer ticking down while not being in a chase is something the devs need to change about legion asap.
---
I've been running into matches where the totems are invisible too. Not sure what's going on
---
&gt; Watch TydeTimes' guides on YouTube

---
how is that relevant? the person asked what killer can smash swfs. i am saying it's Nurse. she doesn't need anything. BUT you as a player need skill, practice and prediction.
---
but there is another option of using Frank's Mixtape to crash swf. 
---
and trust me, love, rare person hates Legion as much as i do. i never said they're good or whatnot. i just said that you get the same power level with this add-on as with Nurse.
---
I hadn't played this game for 3 months when I decided to log in when the Halloween event was ending. After login the menu was running at 5fps, I asked myself "what the fuck did I open this game for" and logged off.
---
It's literally ***impossible*** to lose a hatch stand-off as survivor unless you're actually potato.
---
Killer is camping the hatch? You know where it is, go do gens. If the killer is determined to camp the hatch well easy enough you just open a gate and leave.
---
Oh he's coming to you now because you're popping gens? Take the hit and use the sprint to go straight to the hatch, boom you're out.
---
There's a reason why people say just don't bother and give them the hatch.
---
also the original comment i replied  to mentioned Freddy. i want to see you fukin crash any swf with no add-ons. i guarantee you it's easier with no perks to go against swf than without add-ons.
---
Yeah, this is the worst thing about Legion. You are trying to escape while he basically ignores normal escape options AND if you don’t mend in time you get knocked. It’s just too much advantage and something has got to change. Maybe no bleedout when in chase/terror radius? I’m not sure but it just feels to brain dead to play against a Legion rn. 
---
Since when did DBD have a daily XP boost
---
You shouldn't even need bloodlust to force a pallet drop unless you're respecting pallets, which if you're doing so you're already costing yourself valuable time as a killer.
---
The only tiles you should be gaining bloodlust on are tiles that are purely vaults.
---
Example would be the Asylum infinite, though don't bother with that until you have nothing else left to do.
---
At the very least they could crop my screen down to 16:9 like most other games do that are older.
---
It just doesn’t feel right that the game is close to unplayable because I upgraded my monitor, and even if I took advantage of a native support I’m a mediocre player at best suffering worse now; though I understand that doesn’t mean the better players wouldn’t take use of it. 
---
Normie normie normie
---
yikes people still use that word ? 😬
---
I'm assuming you're over level 15, since you know enough to know a jumpscare Myers build and the proper map. That being said, your survivors also know that when the killer plays a Lerys, it's most likely a scratched mirror Myers. And most survivors don't wanna deal with that build. Lerys is confusing enough to navigate against most killers, but when ol' Mikey Myers is popping around corners and grabbing you out of nowhere, every bit of fun leaves the game for them. They just don't want to deal with an unfun game for a small amount of bp.
---
Barbecue &amp; Chilli and Devour Hope. Name a better power couple, ill wait.
---
Damn you got wrecked lmaooooo
---
Console will rise up and overthrow the devs!
---
Sloppy is bugged on Wraith right now so that the blood fountain never stops. Each new hit adds more blood effect layers and FPS tanks. It ends up [like this] (https://youtu.be/HChmrcZD-bg) pretty quickly.
---
\*stands at exit gate spam missing skillchecks\*
---
And what's funny is I'm not a "survivor main" (I think the mains are stupid, the reason one complains about the other being "op" is cus they don't play the other side to understand) and don't mind ds. I wish more killers would realize that the goal shouldn't be a 4k and you lose some games, and yeah it can get infuriating when a BM Claudette teabags ya then you finally down her only to be ds'd. Yeah that sucks but to be honest, most examples of DS ends up getting downed in 20 seconds WITHOUT enduring and less with with it. It's not that much of an inconvenience.
---
They never hit DS either lol
---
Like I said to the other guy. I’m not going to be asking my friends for a kill your friends and waste their time just so I can practice. Just a lobby with no other players, just the killer, test out their power and get a feel for them.

Well, if you cheat them I can understand other players not liking it or you. If that's enough reason to tunnel is another debate.
---
All Seeing Blood is amazing, especially on Lery's. All Seeing Spirit pairs fantastically with Pop Goes the Weasel, and tells you were you need to apply pressure next.
---
Though it can be demoralizing to turn from a fresh hook and see two/three bright red auras and know you'll never get there in time.
---
Point them out the door and wait patiently. Pepelaugh

Legion: \[SMASH MOUTH:\] "AND THEY DONT STOP COMIN AND THEY DONT STOP COMIN AND THEY DONT STOP COMIN AND THEY DONT STOP COMIN"
---
It has no effect on hiding from Wraith, lol. The Killer can't see the blood fountain, only the affected Survivor can.
---
&gt; So why design a random element that is COMPLETELY unfair to the opponent?
---
Keep in mind that even while these addons and items are in the game, the game is still favored towards survivors. Yes they are annoying, but so are a lot of things from the survivors side. Both sides annoy each other, as is their goal in the game. In the end, looking at statistics it is easy to see survivor players have the upper hand.
---
They wanted to capitalize on DBD hype with their streamers and get that 30 dollar per rube. Now they’ll probably just share development of assets and try to salvage Deathgarden by making it more like DBD.
---
Best tip I got: Use 2 traps early and save 2 for when 1 or no gens are left.
---
Fuck you Leatherman!
---
“Are there any more ~~Squidwards~~ Aces I should know about??!!”
---
right right, that makes a lot of sense, thanks a lot!
---
I didn't cheat or never cheat so still really random that he said that 
---
No, I wasn't talking about KYF lobbies. Just play the regular game. Play against strangers for rank/BPs, not against friends for laughs and giggles.
---
About empty server with no players - are you sure you would understand how Legion works without survivors to drop pallets? Spirit without sounds? Huntress?
---
BHVR = incompetent/resource starved
---
There you go.
---
Ability:
---
 Actor's Spirit: The Director masks himself as a different killer at the start, gaining their movement speed and a nerfed version of their ability (Trapper gets one trap, huntress gets one hatchet, etc) 
---
When a survivor is hooked, he whips off his costume dramatically as his identity is revealed. Default weapon is a whip, a prop from his last film. Can M2 to channel a costume change. Only one costume per trial.
---
Perks:
---
Everyone's a Critic: the bad manners of survivors fuels you with rage. You're trying your hardest to put on a good show and they have no appreciation. When a survivor emotes in front of you, teabags, flashlight blinds, or uses Decisive Strike, gain a token. At 5 tokens, your grip tightens and survivors can no longer struggle. At 15 tokens, you can kill survivors by your hand.
---
Non-disclosure agreement: Some sacrifices have to be made in Hollywood. All perks, offerings, and items are hidden from all survivors until the trial is over.
---
In the Spotlight: you're determined to make all your actors superstars. Hitting a survivor causes a beam of light to shine at their current location for 5 seconds.
---
I still hope they will tweak it so it does something more than just giving bps.
---
Best to put a trap on after you've hooked two-three survivors. The only time I really use a trap is if they start to pop generators one after the after in a short span of time. Conserve the traps, don't waste them at the start. Her add-ons aren't the greatest but they aren't the worst either. The best map in my opinion as her is Lery's Memorial Institute. It's reasonably big, lots of places to slip and sneak by in her crouch form and the map hides the hexes reasonably well.
---
Ideally, for perks that I use with her in my opinion, I go with - BBQ &amp; Chilli, Hex: Ruin, Unnerving Presence, and Sloppy Butcher. The reason behind sloppy butcher is it slows down progression when injured so searching boxes can be difficult for an injured survivor.
---
Happy cake day fellow Myers main!
---
I always lose a braincell when i see NOED on 1 shot killers for example: Billy, Leatherface, Clown, Huntress and Myers
---
You left the match. Sorry, nope I have no sympathy.
---
what's the reason behind Unnerving?
---
I play against red rank survivors and they generally *miss* their DS about 10% of the time. You should know that very well, if you actually play rank 1 killer.
---
HAHA
---
you can level past 50, bloodwebs are infinite, 50 is the max level, but there is no level for bloodwebs
---
I have an i5 4460 (ingame usage never goes above 65%) and a 1060 6GB. Can't play High/Ultra at 60fps anymore because the game shits itself and drops frames for no reason. Even low/medium run worse now.
---
You can't edit the configs anymore. You can still mess with the fps cap I believe, but trying to change graphical settings will not work.
---
It ties into an add-on that increases the number of skill-checks you receive when searching a box. Unnerving Presence tightens the skill-checks and makes some people who don't expect it mess up.
---
what?
---
Me thinks Myers would love sprint burst. Put that on your tuft tombstone pizza
---
Well just take heart that you didn’t have to cheat to win (if this was lag-switch), every game is a gamble :( especially when it’s a multiplayer game and the ref is asleep.
---
Stupid and dumb post, not even funny.
---
Instructions not clear, Stretcher ended up in pond instead of ER 
---
A killer with good stealth and an insta down is trash. You're a smart one, aren't you? 
---
Honestly, it'll be pointless. Being a main to a P3 character, I'd rather get them as many perks maxed out as possible than start over and pray for the best. You'd waste more time by starting over again if you wanted to reset your characters level from P3 level 50 to P3 level 01.
---
that's very situational. Pig has a pretty small terror radius for now, why would you be around boxes instead of actively chasing people who can still do gens? that's so weird when Pigs chase those in traps.
---
Or just keep leveling the bloodweb until you get the perks you want?
---
I don't go around boxes, I'm mostly patrolling generators if only one person has a trap on their head. Half the time the perk kicks in quite well because typically the boxes spawn near gen spawns.
---
Let's say I run TOTH, Ruin and Devour Hope. How your new TOTH ("survivors have to cleanse both hex totems to disable hex ruin") would work with this build? What if my 4th perk is Third Seal?
---
Congrats! The Huntress’s snipe trophy probably requires friends...
---
You know if i actually had the money for DLC perks that would be great :D
---
Other than that I will try unnerving presence although I do try to go for a more sneaky ambush type.  
---
But yeah I will start doing traps after the first gen or two, lets see if that works out =v=
---
This reeks of r/iamverysmart 
---
It isn't, it's just the best way to survive as long as possible but I would say it is definitly annoying both from a gameplay and a lore perspective.
---
Gameplay:
---
It is just boring gameplay for both sides. As a survivor you know: "Yep, gotta keep running in a circle so I will be able to use that pallet the most effective way. Repeat until I have no pallets left nearby and the killer gets me". And as a killer you know: "Yeah, I need to run in that circle, knowing I will end up standing infront of a pallet with the survivor on the other side. Repeat until there is no pallet loop nearby and I can get that survivor."
---
Lore:
---
Imagine this: You are chased by someone who wants to murder you. Would you say: "Yep the best way to live is to keep running in circles."?
---
Yeah most of the time survivors load into my lobby with below 130 ping but sometimes they'll just load in with 600 ping 
---
What's that
---
Obviously Amanda has S tier stun noise, but the tantrum thrown by the Huntress is top tier as well.
---
Getting stuck in a corner where you'll definitely get hit if the killer finds you is one thing. The killer being an arse and using it to hold you as a hostage is an entirely different thing.
---
Then why do you play it
---
I see, may I ask what perks would be good for if you were using 'free' perks? Without any teachable's as I really don't have that kind of cash (or time) to be leveling killers and grabbing it. 
---
***EW3 THEME PLAYS LOUDLY***
---
Favoring survivors? Isn't it the average game 2 survivors die but the killer gets roughly 10k more bloodpoints? This game doesn't favor survivor mains at all. If you die as a survivor (statistically 50 percent of the time) you get 10 to 15k bloodpoints. I've seen games where all survivors escape and STILL the killer gets 25k and more than any other survivor.
---
Obligatory fuccboi comments:
---
"Oh no, they can't just add more time to complete gens because that's not fun! Holding down M1 for x number of seconds isn't fun! Everything has to be fun for Survivors!" Quoth the fuccbois.
---
Or 
---
"Oh no, let's make secondary objectives an EVENT rather than make them be part of the base game." Quoth Matthieu Cote. 
---
If you prefer a sneaky ambush more often, switch Unnerving Presence over with something like Thanatophobia or Whispers. Whispers is great for tracking.
---
Disable vsync. I get 144 fps. 
---
You've managed to miss the posts point entirely.
---
Getting stuck in a corner where you'll definitely get hit if the killer finds you is one thing. The killer being an arse and using it to hold you as a hostage is an entirely different one.
---
yikes . lets try again .
---
Never compare BHVR to wildcard BHVR might be clueless but wildcard are pathetic they've somehow managed to drive their 30 million players game into the ground 
---
I believe you may have misunderstood ToTH.  You do not gain tokens when a totem is cleansed, you start with all 5 totems(reducing speed by 30% immediately), and as each totem on the map is cleansed you will lose tokens making cleansing other totems faster as the match progresses.
---
Survivors going for the lit totems first is what you want with ToTH, since they get the maximum cleanse penalty from that, and you get the most amount of time to stop them before they finish.  
---
Tbf, why are you playing Nurse on PS4?
---
Ah yes the super survivor sided game where most matches end with 2 dead and two escapes which is a win for the killer. 
---
The game will always be at least a little killer favored because of the point system basically garunteeing the killer more points than the survivor and as far as actually gameplay goes survivors def aren’t favored 
---
god i wish my games against nurse could go like this
---
I was gonna say...
---
I just had a match where jake sabotaged all of my hooks DX
---
I would get 1 survivour, and bam he's suddenly at the next hook finishing sabotaging it. 
---
:l
---
I did not win that match but i killed him in the end :D
---
If there only was his magnificent beard
---
Thanks man, and thank you for trying =v=
---
when i get them i will try them
---
Launch was horrifying for low end users. 
---
Just a quick random update, rocket league is now cross-platform (PC, ps4, and xbox) so progress has been made albeit slow
---
Doctor : had to shock it em
---
That's why survivors are picking this map and feeling good, when they can loop a killer at tiles, where killers have zero mind game potential. Usually you know as killer, what's going on, if a survivor brings a green farm offering. 
---
Considering what's written that's fucking impossible
---
but thats a payoff. time vs. safety. imo stuff like that is good for a game. without it the meta can be solved too easy and the whole game will get stale.
---
His guides are good, his tier lists are a meme
---
I love this but I hate this 
---
I love this but I hate this
---
Seeing how their new game seems to be an absolute failure and dead in the water  there’s at least some hope that they will focus on DbD instead.
---
What about no0b3?He was mostly playing billy and wraith.
---
This isn't dead by daylight related at all.
---
Regardless my idea is still a buff. With ToTH survivors still cleanse totems fast and the notification is not very good. Having to clean two totems to rid the hex perk would be better....even by a little bit
---
You can use it for a few things, shame that dumbass is heating it out :/ i have a good thing going here
---
Oh hell no. I'm not gonna get in that discussion again.
---
My girlfriend got one with a ping of 900 yesterday, didn't even know that was possible haha
---
Inb4 the shitstorm.
---
Play huntress if you want to get better at the game.Play legion if you want to lose braincells.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well
---
I haven't prestieged my nurse but I have  way more green add-ons then I do brown ones.
---
I haven't seen it so I have no comment, I would imagine it being even more stressful though.
---
It has a lot to do with remembering bad experiencnces and feelings more then good ones. Like the complaints on ds, even at red ranks I realize people miss that shit a lot 😂 and if they don't I usually kill then like right afterwards (unless I was next to a pallet or window which are core mechanics so it doesn't really trigger me). Even Noed, I did a test and at red ranks I only got to use noed like 3 out of like 9 matches. Another problem is how constant rank resets are with no insentive to rank up causing high ranks to stay low for easy games and bp.
---
Aside from the third act the second Nightmare is solid. It's where we get the talkative Freddy that became an icon. 2 is far better than anything after Dream Master. (Not including New Nightmare)
---
Ah so I assume legion is one of the more disliked killers? As stated I’m pretty new to the game and even newer to the subreddit so I’m not really up to speed on most people’s view of things.
---
Personnel*
---
So... I cleanse Ruin totem, Ruin still active... I cleanse Third Seal totem, Ruin AND Third Seal still active... Sounds kinda OP without any way to say which totem is TOTH.
---
I forgot about this movie. Is it still on Netflix?
---
It's true, but that's the way it is.
---
Whether or not it favors survivors or killer is irrelevant. The random element which tilts the playing field in either direction to such extreme degree is just another layer of frustration in the game. You sort of have to question the line of thinking the developers have when they design this kind of stuff. I mean. WHY? It essentially just ruins the game for at least one player. 
---
Yes Ed. 
---
It already takes about 45 seconds to destroy 1 totem. You gain at least another 10 seconds with toth which gives you almost a full minute to get to it abd grab or hit someone off of it. 
---
You can get the most out of it by using it as a tracking perk early on in the match or even mid to late match if it's still active by then. Or combine it with ruin and devour hope as well. It greatly slows the game down for survivors because now they're scared to commit to finishing it since they think you might have hex haunted ground.
---
People focus way to hard on totems in this game.
---
As a mainly survivor player, I still can‘t understand how someone can so heavily complain about NOED. Not in the slightest as bad as DS for killers. Just watch your ass.
---
Avatar the last airbender
---
It's more of a fun/meme addon and not how you should be playing Myers most of the time.
---
It just takes so long to get to evil 3 and your movement speed is also reduced.. 
---
DBD would've died without a progression system. 
---
Garbage survs. 
---
Ok I will when I I got everything and chose to get a killer I don’t like to start with and then is a bad killer
---
lol
---
Tbh Im really scared about dedicated servers, imagine rubberbanding as Nurse or Billy, or not living near a server....
---
Ducktales_moon_level.mp3
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA "few bugs" HAHAHAHA
---
This post will cause a few arguments should it make it to the frontpage.
---
and they dont even know about it
---
No matter what's being said about Legion, it'll spark a debate.
---
On one hand, it'd be nice if everyone could just enjoy a meme. On the other, the more people argue, the more karma this post will get.
---
Skill check 3 gen lock down doc approves your comment 
---
This totally appears to be sincere and not a certain type of player upset about a certain type of thing.
---
i liked it so damn much damn
---
Well, if they shut down their servers - matchmaking won't be possible anyway. 
---
Is that doctor not wearing a shirt? Those honestly look like nipples there. Who be molestin us with pictures of DS with no shirt on?
---
I think mains of anything really should not talk about balance honestly. It should be those who play both pretty much equally cause their view would be looking from both perspectives 
---
I actually meet quite a lot of toxic squads around rank 8. I bring booba with lightborn, spirit fury, enduring and franklins, usually get 3 of them, because they are all idiots who just dive and die to chainsaw, last one getting the hatch.
---
Besides they are rank 1
---
F
---
No one likes legion. Even people who exclusively play as killer don't like legion.
---
Survivors don't like legion because there's no counter play to him. You get tunneled the entire match. Which means he follows you everywhere until you go into the dying state. Giving a slow ass killer the borrowed time timer on hit was the worst idea the devs have ever had. Survivors spend the greater majority healing for the length of the match. They shouldn't but they do.
---
Killers don't like him because he's boring to play as. You stare at the floor after you frenzy someone and just follow blood stains the entire match. He's slow and his ability hurts the overall gameplay not just his ability in a chase. The only effective way to use him is to tunnel someone until they DC or die. If you use him the way he was intended then you're gonna get walked all over in the same way nurse on console gets curb stomped.
---
The only upside to him is that he's a blood point farming machine. 
---
Oh look, this again 
---
I think omegablink is really lame tho, I prefer catatonics boy's treasure and wooden horse, its not as broken and still works
---
Double stun wast stupid as well. But this killer doesn't need buffs or nerfs, they need rework.
---
I too lagswitch on dedicated servers because I am a wizard. 
---
DS is a game changer in very limited circumstances.
---
NOED is almost always a game changer. It almost always means there’ll be one fewer escape.
---
With DS, there has to be somewhere for the Survivor to run to and get away that isn’t out in the open. Otherwise, the Killer can catch up because of the trail, and there’s always a trail because the Survivor always runs.
---
They’re simply not comparable.
---
Cleansing totems requires everyone to think “I should be on the lookout for totems” and to act on that while they’re doing generators. It simply requires too many pieces come together in a certain way. 
---
NOED is far less likely to be countered and almost never fails to be activated (even if the totem eventually is cleansed).
---
Okay. Still with me? Because this is unexpected.
---
I really feel like this aspect of the game ought to be asymmetric. It wouldn’t be exciting otherwise. 
---
I used to be a Survivor main but I’m about 50/50 now. I initially fell in love with this game because of how scary it was because of the vulnerability and attention required in playing Survivor. 
---
I like the asymmetry in this facet of the game. Playing Killer helped me realize that even though there are asymmetries, playing Killer is still really hard.
---
I personally just don't want to see the iconic Alien raped in this game. It doesn't fit in it. It makes no sense in any way. Why would Alien be putting people on hooks? Why would Alien be interested in generators? Why would Alien be confined to just walking around on the ground, not scampering and running on all fours?
---
I don't think Freddy belongs in this game either to be honest. I just don't know enough about the character or the universe he is from to be that upset about it.
---
The solution is simple:
---
1. Jumping through the hatch should take just a bit longer than it does for a Killer to wipe their weapon. This would end hatch standoffs and give Killers some hatch counter-play.
---
2. If you don't jump through the hatch within 3-5 minutes of it opening, your aura is permanently revealed to the Killer. This is stop Survivors taking the game hostage.
---
Dont worry we were "friends" for almost 2 minutes of a survivor game.
---
You're probably not as good as you think you are ...
---
I wish we would stop spreading BS like that. If DS is keeping killers busy for 2 years its their own decision.
---
I cannot agree more, like you have to loop in order to survive, but lore-wisely it's seems so stupid. The best thing is watching a survivor looping a killer from a perspective of another survivor. It looks like tom &amp; Jerry
---
I'd say it's likely to go live this week. PTBs normally last 2 weeks, if I remember right.
---
But that's not how it works on this sub and we all know it. You can definitely see who's on the sub at certain times you post just by the up/down votes posts and comments get.
---
Its because Killers are Crybabies. I am SO not ready how forums and reddit is gonna explode after next patch when Backup DS gets useable more again. 
---
If it’s not tomorrow on Tuesday then it’ll come out next Tuesday 
---
Jesus, look what ds does to killers...
---
30 seconds? More like 3 seconds
---
\*david gets protected by motherly instincts\* DEADHARD TO INFINITY AND BEYOND
---
While I appreciate the suggestions, this post is more focused on a Survivor standing on/around the Hatch, before it opens, waiting for the other Survivor to be found and Killed.
---
Complains about a certain group being toxic yet still instigates controversy with an image like that. lol
---
That's very narrow minded. I never touch surv and legion is my fav killer :)
---
gg ez duuuud me ochido you is beby killel duuud
---
I don't even main survivor LOL, salty kid.
---
forgot to mention
---
slow the game down just a little bit
---
Got the game when it was free on PS4. Have Kill 4 Players in One Match, Sacrifice 500 Players, Whole Team Escape Through the Hatch, Survive with 5000 BP in Every Category and Prestige 2, 3 and 3-50 to do.
---
Feel like I'm almost there!
---
I had a match as billy and all of the pallets were invisible. That shit was hilarious.
---
Honestly noed just makes me want to quit this game, its so unfun, and in last few weeks I met like maybe 3 killers who doesn't run it. You doing great, all 4 people alive, bam, at least one person getting killed for sure and if you wanna save him, well buddy, you getting killed too. And no, cleansing totems is not a real counter, as you waste gen or two worth of time cleansing them, and of course you will miss one totem almost always to counter a perk which might not even exist. 
---
DS is annoying, but as a killer I learned to just leave ds guy alone, he usually gets all cocky and happy you don't want to chase him, he fallows you all game doing nothing, while you murder his team. Most of the time he just farms, and helps you with killing.
---
Brooklyn Nine-Nine comes to mind. Is that right? I can picture Rose saying it.
---
nea looks even more like a killer
---
Nice toxic post about the other side you obviously don’t play being toxic.
---
dude quentin is one of the coolest characters in the game IMO
---
#2 and #3 are too artificial. They reads like every "anti-camping" suggestions - "let's punish players who play in a way I don't like".
---
...you say 15 meters radius? They'll stay at 16.
---
Aint it funny that a guy with nearly 6k Games on Steam is talking about a game with progression system in that way. 
---
this is amazing
---
Or when you injured the music is so annoying. I don't want to heal, but I have to because it's so god damn annoying and you can't hear anything.
---
its especially fun to get hooked in games like that and see what the other survivors are doing. hiding in a locker on the other side of the map, while the killer just injured someone isnt the correct play.
---
Nea the leatherface. 
---
Pure evil
---
that was a really fun video and the saddest thing is, how the claudette thinks she actually was useful.
---
Lmfao I also feel like my haunted grounds has the best spawns cus no one clenses them
---
Yup happens all the time ! 
---
Oh wait, now, it's a very rare occurence. Let's still balance the game around it.
---
Escape through dungeon 
---
I have fucking 1060 and it still runs pretty bad on medium settings, getting dips to 50 for no reason, and new map is all over the place, it is so badly optimized.
---
That is only possible in the files and may count as changing gamefiles.
---
Claudi actually looking Pog with those blue eyes, but Nea on the other hand. 
---
I had a teammate try that shit on me tonight. The killer lost me and found the other dude. They stared at each other and he pointed at me. He seen me looping the killer real hard and then decided to stand under the pallet to try body blocking me. There was *JUST* enough room for me to get by and throw the pallet down on both the killer and the assclown trying to sandbag me. I got my stun and he sandbagged himself by taking a forced hit meant for me because he got pushed to the side with the killer. I had a good laugh at him.
---
not really
---
they usually drop updates on Tuesday too so might be today in around 5 hours 
---
Consoles actually are 2012 PCs btw
---
wth are you talking about? I am saying instead of cleansing ONE hex totem to remove ruin it takes TWO to remove it if you are using TOTH.
---
5 TOTEMS:
---
TOTH = 1
---
Ruin = 1
---
Third = 1
---
Another hex = 1
---
Why you would use that many hex perks IDK...but either way that is a max of 4 hex perks with 5 totems...therefore ruin can take 2 hex totems to clean...or it can even be random and only apply to one of the hex perks you bring in...which if you only bring Ruin it guarantees you that ruin takes 2 hex totems cleaned to disable.
---
JUST HAD A MATCH AS HUNTRESS. IT WAS FUCKING AWFUL. HOOKED NO ONE. ONE BODY-BLOCKED ME. MISSED ANOTHER AT POINT BLANK RANGE. NEVER SAW OTHER TWO SURVIVORS. ALL MOCKED ME IN CHAT AFTERWARDS. SAID I WAS WORST KILLER EVER.
---
YES, I GET IT. I'M AWFUL. STOP FUCKING LAUGHING AT ME.

Legion is the only killer I like to play but even I stopped playing him because it just made me feel so shitty for the other team.
---
Its good but I think it can be a little better...esp at rank 1 survivors
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
Jesus, this post shows just how trash this community can be. The Legion definitely has its problems, more so than any other killer, but don’t go ahead and bring someone down for choosing to play a killer that they personally enjoy. The devs decided to release Legion as they are and people have paid to play as them. If someone wants to main Legion then that’s their choice. Enjoyment isn’t the same for every single person. I find Hillbilly boring as shit but some people absolutely love how he works. I hate going against Hag but don’t mind Legion. We all have our preferences so pipe down and leave the damn guy alone. 
---
Thank you, been meaning to see one for a while about my degenerated l5-s1 disc.
---
perhaps...think i might try ruin, toth, haunted grounds at rank 1 and see what happens. for research purposes...
---
My Jake is P3 level 50 with all the free characters+Tapp' perks maxed up. I'm levelling Laurie now.
---
I don't think I'm missing a point. You speak from point of view of a survivor who tries to finish gens, and you want to punish those, who don't try. But they won't do gens, if they'll be punished for staying close to a hatch. They'll just urban evading along the walls, doing nothing and waiting for you to die. Only thing that will change is that they will be in other parts of a map.
---
&gt; As to your criticism of 15 meters, what would suggest than?
---
Nothing. Suggestions 2 and 3 are just bad, in my opinion. First one? Sounds reasonable as a PTB try-out.
---
Ugh this happens all too much. I'll unhook or just find a teammate being tunneled to take a hit all fr them to slam a pallet on me, screaming me over. I dont think it's always intentional, but for the love of god if someone is trying to help you let them throw the damn pallet down.
---
no prob, those typically degrade quickly when you are bent over taking it up the ass alot.
---
Oh look another garbage "us vs them" post. Cant we get along? End of day we're all playing the same game.
---
nah, i understand. but you can play on their Altruism or lack of it, you can outsmart. they have to work as a team real well vs a skilled killer. but from Legion no matter how good the survivor is one can't get away due to how their power is designed. 
---
A lot of survivors don't realise that yes, NOED is a perk that essentially gives you a free hit. There's quite a few perks that steal a hit from a killer.
---
My annoyance with DS has always been that the survivor gets an instant one-state heal when they hit the skill check. Would much prefer them to go to a Borrowed Time-like bleed out or become Broken or something.
---
Not every perk needs to be a top tier rank 1 worthy perk.  I think even at rank 1 it can still be good though, but not all perks are designed around beating the best survivors.  It does require a little awareness and sometimes more effort than it's worth to actually defend.  It's rarely takes over games, but it does allow the killer the chance to defend the totems and that can be very powerful.  There's certainly many perks worse, and hexes are balanced around being cleanse-able and if ToTH made it too much more difficult then it could be very broken and unfun. 
---
ok
---
Well at first I was saying that but you just made my idea better by questioning me. Now I am saying one of the hex perks out of all of them will take two hex totems to destroy.
---
Getting double pips as survivor can be one of the most frustrating things in this game since it essentially means your team isn't doing shit.
---
i was looking for a dad joke in the picture xD
---
As someone who plays a lot with No Mither, i wish when running the perk one didn't have the injured music, it's so damn loud...
---
*oink*
---
commit die
---
While that alien charge seems like billy v2, I love Ellen’s perks. I get chills every time I hear that famous, “Get away from her you bitch!”
---
Also in this scenario, you could run Haunted Ground + ToTH + Ruin + Third Seal for a total of 6 totems, when only 5 are on the map.
---
Dude that shit gets cleansed in the loading screen.
---
You can see grass moving, crows flying away etc 
---
I think people get lost in their own personal game and forget the asymmetry. One survivor is only one-quarter of what the killer is up against and yet most survivors who complain think they should be "equal" in strength to a killer and be able to "carry" in some sense of the word.
---
Thing is, the game is kind of built so that, in a chase, eventually, the killer will win, no matter how much you evade and loop. It's more about how much time you can waste. All that NOED essentially does is cut the amount of time you can waste by half. And honestly, smart survivors won't let it affect more than one survivor because once you see that it's active you should be hauling arse and giving up on any chance of altruism.
---
Yeah, it sucks to be that one guy who gets nailed by it, but again, you're one of a team of four, and ultimately the asymmetic nature of the game allows you to be fucked even if you play the whole thing perfectly because given enough time, the killer will always get you anyway.
---
All these answers are equal, but Pig is more equal
---
The thing about me playing on console is I dont ever see many of the glitches that I see on PC. The only glitch I have encountered is me getting stuck in a tree. 
---
But what he is saying is true. Let's say a player has 1000+ hours as a killer (as I know there are many). They are going to be a lot better at taking advantage of mistakes that survivors make than someone that has only as 10/100hours played as a killer. Killers rely a lot on the mistakes that survivors make like being too altruistic or not doing gens. 
---
When running 2 totems at the same time (or playing against them)
---
Devour hope: spawns in front of the entire survivor team
---
Ruin: gets found when 2 people are already dead and the third one is hooked 
---
No point in having completely useless perks either. (Territorial Imperative for example) 
---
"very broken and unfun" ... unfun for who?
---
depends on who you are playing against..
---
The fact that a rational statement like this was downvoted into the negatives is pretty much a testatement to the manbabies on the reddit though : D
---
You guys are gonna do great at helping to rework freddy, I can feel it.
---
Dungeons and Deviousness
---
I had my game scaled down to -40% resolution (i never set it that low but i could not change it either no matter what i did...) and got *almost* 30 FPS out of it on Low setting.
---
I got a new rig so i run the game on Ultra now, it does look pretty but i'm getting some serious "corn" blindness everywhere (as killer) since it's all so detailed :P
---
the crawler dlc spotlight 
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
When I see killer concepts so beautifully presented I wonder - do people make that from scratch - or are there some templates knocking around? I have a pair of concepts I've been working on but don't know anything about graphic design or image editing.
---
 Background: we got decimated early after 2 gens have been activated.  I had an absolute failure trying to do fireworks save then a Claudette DC'd on the rest of us.  I tried to unhook a David only to get hooked myself.  Things looked grim but then this happened. 
---
I mean, not necessarily, yeah Claudette has self care and near invisibility at times but that’s it. Plus this game mode would show the killer exactly what they’re getting in for before the game actually starts. 
---
It’s more for the change of pace from typical gameplay I guess. Definitely wouldn’t be for everyone. 
---
Very true but seeing 4 Laurie’s in a match you’d know you have 4 DS which could be a real pain
---
Both. Usually theyd do this while injured as a last ditch effort. 
---
&gt; Which let's be fair if a person is playing killer it's because they want to be a dick. 
---
Okay, I was with you up until this. This is the type of adversarial reasoning that gets a community nowhere by just pitting it against itself. Lots of people play both roles, believe it or not, and they're just simple humans who want to play a game and don't buy into the idea that you have to get salty or toxic at everything that goes wrong or is imbalanced in the game. 
---
Sometimes they just don't want to sit on a generator for a game or get tunnelled, or as you've handily pointed out they just want to earn more bloodpoints than the other role. It's funny because your entire comment before your edit is a compelling argument for why a normal person *would* want to play killer.
---
Psa: as a killer main dont do this, hold on to hope, I have bbq and chili and see them waiting over there.
---
Spine Chill does not work on T1/Scratched Mirror Myers actually. All detection perks are useless against him when he's in T1 like Object of Obsession (he can still see you though if you look in his direction), Spine Chill, Alert (still gives a notification, doesn't show aura). Not sure about Rancor and Premonition, since I've never used those against a T1 Myers.
---
I love the perks. However, the alien ability is completely overpowered, like 100% completely, unless you make up for it with a natural 44m terror radius.
---
I feel more helpless as a solo queue survivor when the killer wants to harass me in future lobbies because I called them "toxic" once in post-game lobby.  Meanwhile the killer can just take ebony mori and play nurse with no-ed and focus the one person easily.
---
The solution to SWF is to double the amount of gens for how many people are in a group
---
2 SWF = 10 gens
---
3 SWF = 20 gens
---
4 SWF = 40 gens
---
I think this balance might be a bit subtle though
---
What is it
---
Case in point: The downvotes.
---
I keep saying it and I'll say it again. If both survivor and killer are at open hatch automatic dance off ensues. Survivor wins they get to escape. If killer wins it's a unique hatch Mori. 
---
Imagine The Shape, Pig, Nurse, all of them, with their own dance style.

---
With the new update perks like bloodwarden will be used a lot more frequently.
---
This will be hell as solo-survivor but I'm honestly happy for the killers, this change is really important to have a chance against SFWs. 
---
What
---
Lol
---
It's more of a gimmick addon to be used with his fragrant tuft of hair addon (the other ultra rare) to get the achievement of mori'ing all four survivors.
---
This is honestly a little depressing...
---
-Legion music intensifies- somebody say gens?
---
Lol I had this happen to me as dwight killer kept downing everyone and then he watched me finish gens and open the door haha
---
When you’re the obsession and have DS, but missed it and still don’t wiggle
---
No. Kidding.
---
Take Hex TotH. When i play as Spirit /w Prayer Beads i always get a laugh when i phase and grab survivors off totems.
---
calling DS useless is crazy. I mean, I personally find it useless because I'm garbage and can't hit it to (literally) save my life, but it's easily one of the best survivor perks in the game.
---
Well with tuft and tombstone you don’t need to worry about ds 
---
I think she's fab, Only got her recently and she's definitely one of my favourite killers now.  I had heard that she's hard to use, but I took to her straight away.  I'm not necessarily great with her but I do have a lot of fun using her ability.  Are you using headphones?  If not you definitely should, with all killers really.  Watch a few vids about her too, can pick up some great tips.
---
Don't give up on her...
---
started playing a week ago and heard from a friend that legion is bad
---
Yes, but it's not a thing the devs added
---
All Saturday I couldn't find a game with a ping lower than 300. Thought it was my connection so I did a reset on my router but nothing improved. Checked my speed and connection and it all passed. Played yesterday and everything was back to normal so not sure what the issue was. I was on Xbox btw.
---
Pretty sure bae means poo in danish, so I ageee
---
I haven't heard that name in years... *looks longingly at dark corner of map*
---
I mean, an equivilent from the killer's side, what if he's calculated his chase to catch someone only for during the chase Adrenaline to activate? 
---
NOED is very popular at the moment so you'd be safer assuming that once the gens are done NOED is going to be a factor. Not allowing for the possibility of NOED in your calculations means your calculations are faulty, in the same manner of a killer not allowing for the possibility of an Adrenaline/DS from a non-obsession survivor.
---
Yes, it's irritating, and you could argue these types of perks should be removed. But they're there, and if you're not playing around them or not allowing for the fact that they might be being played, then that's on you. You've gotta play the game you're given.
---
Maybe it's the fact that most players prioritise finding the Ruin totem ASAP? I know I do.
---
Isn't this the really gay movie in the series 
---
Majority of the community has freezes when *anything* happens in game and they still play it?
---
Doubt.
---
Yes, yes it is. They foresaw voice chat being a thing that would be op for survivors to have, so they didn’t add it for that reason. But later on, they decided to create the exact problem that they had already fixed by allowing people to play SWF, which, again, is just playing Survivor but with voice chat. 
---
DUDE. THAT'S ME!
---
We can fight over the lore if you want. 
---
Let me start:
---
I think the lore in this game is good and you can see that they put effort in it to try to tell a bigger story witch Benedict Baker and since the Halloween Event with Viggo. Also I do like the overall lore articles on the wiki about the different killers and survivors. They all have a backstory which forms their character.
---
Considering she’s widely regarded as a top tier killer, no. She is one of the harder killers to master, along the same lines as Nurse and Huntress to an extent. This is the equivalent of “Nurse is trash because of her fatigue and because of how slow she is”. You just don’t know how to use her, at all clearly. Actually take time to sit down with her and see how her power gives her a massive advantage at chases, loops and mind games. 
---
If you want to get better at Huntress I suggest you to watch ScottJund on Twitch (Damnnohtml on yt). He has over 2k hours solely on her so he knows what he's talking about. Other streamers that are also good with her are Umbra_bug, RalpfromtheSouth and ZubatLEL.
---
Oh, sure they can. Voice chat provides a massive advantage to Survivors. Give SWF groups a downside that’s just as massive and we’re all good. Give them a 50% penalty to generator repair speed. Done, fixed. I came up with the idea in fifteen seconds. I’m sure I’m not the first person to suggest the idea, but my point still stands. 
---
I mean, as long as the rest of them uses it for something, right? Last match I got hooked and camped - no  biggie, but my 2 Claudettes were just sitting nearby, watching. Just watching. 
---
Bullshit. I de piped from rank 1 back down to 2 because of a killer dc 
---
Yep, you get 50k bloodpoints for doing the killer and survivor tutorial as well
---
I can assure you that there are a lot of them on the steam version too, but there are also the ones who really use the potential of a pallett to its fullest extent.
---
Agreed. It absolutely should start counting down when Deep Wound is applied. 
---
Why does that look like Patrick Stewart dressed as Freddy? What joke did I miss?
---
Even the spoon and pocket watch? Which literally reduces fatigue duration which is purely beneficial. 
---
You said "since they decided to add voice chat for survivors in SWF". That would mean they added an ingame voicechat for survivors in a SWF group. Now you're arguing that SWF shouldn't be a thing, which is just ridiculous. Of course SWF is going to be a thing, people want to play games with friends
---
Go commit have bad time
---
Basically we played legion how the devs intended. He was shite ass. Now we found out that his purple addons are busted. You can abuse his mechanics so that survs can't counter play much.
---
Ah alrighty thanks for the advice 
---
Do you have a source for totem formations? I can't find anything on the wiki.
---
Low ranks are the one place where you CAN play anykiller... while envious of the low ranks, you really just got a few salty survivors. Freddy is the only known killer actually linked to lag and frame drops specifically in this patch...
---
99 the gates and then wait for the person to get hooked before finishing it, as long as the other door is not open you are good to then run out. Or since it only last for a min you can just stay outside of it so the killer can’t see your aura and you can tell when it’s over
---
We need this now. Players numbers are dwindling on consoles.
---
I'm telling ya, he's not bad, I'm not crazy, don't lock me up again!
---
Go commit not be rude
---
Shut up and take my money
---
It’s a slugging build. Stop crying about it. 
---
They’re perks in the game that are applied to totems. Since you know what dull totems are, hex totems are dull totems that have a fire lit underneath them which signifies there is an active hex perk that the killer has. If you destroy the hex totem, you break their hex perk and they can’t use it for the rest of the game. Examples of hex perks would be ruin, haunted grounds, devour hope, and the aforementioned NOED.
---
Ahhh! This is so good! Could you do my sleepy boy Q sometime? 
---
Ahem, trapper.
---
That is really cool ^ ^ what kinda pencils did you use?
---
jUsT cLEaNsE dULL TOteMs bRO
---
I think the games not inviting, engaging or fun for new players. The enjoyment of the game relies on power fantasy, either you enjoy grouping with people to bully a killer in to depression (im a killer main I hate you) or you enjoy single handedly destroying 4 people, either way it requires a time sync. While the community think this is funny and the reviews are from babies (get Gud scrubz lul XD rekt I'm sending that clip to ochiDO) the point of the weekend is to get new players, no new players the games dies. I like the game, huntress is life, but if everyone else thinks it's broken and total garbage. It's broken and total garbage. Instead of hating on these people we should push the devs to make the game better and engaging. I think in reality they havnt done a good job, allot of DLC and cosmetics but nothing really new and core changing. You're still holding buttons to do gens then holding buttons to open door then leaving with janky animations, weird hitboxes and ALLOT of bugs along the way, I can see why people dont like it.
---
Yare yare daze
---
You're wrong she's.  She's got a big booty that's fun to stare at while you're playing
---
normal slugging build, quite fun but only works if there is no swf
---
The biggest problem with Spirit is that right now sounds are broken. When sounds work well she is top tier. 
---
You good bro?
---
Tall man stalking you with a foot long kitchen knife and he makes just that *noise*
---
It's funny to think how polished dbd is compared to friday the 13th when Dbd is full of bugs lmao.
---
It’s not that we don’t like losing chases, it’s that there’s no way to win a chase vs a legion who wants to down you. Losing a chase because you got outplayed and losing a chase that was impossible to win are 2 different things. 
---
But based on your math it *is* converging down to a 0%.  It just wont ever get there but your odds of it not appearing still decreases. And like I said we are getting more unlucky than not from this point forward if it doesn’t appear.
---
Why would you use only her perks? They're not that great on her... I'm a spirit main and I use  Devour Hope, BBQ and Chili, Pop goes the weasel and thrill of the hunt.
---
Enough thx
---
The killer has 0 skill and counterplay due to awful design so you cant even get gut since every match aginst him isbthe absolute same boring thing. He is awfully designed and thats why these posts exists.
---
Xb1 player here. Me and my friends all got the game and tried to find a match at rank 13ish. Took 15 minutes 
---
When I first pick up my Obsession, I just stand still and either tank the stun or wait until they start to wiggle. Somehow standing still catches a few people off guard and they miss their DS. No idea why but it happens.
---
I just walk towards a hook, no mindgame, just saving time.
---
Gameplay wise freddy. His power hed just pick people off 1 by 1.
---
#30_fps_are_enough
---
I'm around rank hovering around 10 on killer and usually theres at least one person who escapes every match
---
One, I don't think the game is broken beyond repair. And two, just because memes are most upvoted, doesn't mean criticism is dismissed. 
---
It doesn't require too much balancing, make it so you cant SWF with an above 5 rank difference, and when you DO, make it so killer is above the group rank by 1 or 2.
---
That leaves the Rank 1 full SWF groups but at least the bigger % is tackled...
---
 **༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ** **Summon the bacon event** **༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ** 
---
I find it a lot easier to hit when they just want to eat it by standing still. Only 1 focus (without your camera moving) 
---
Hnnnnng
---
/r/cursedimages 
---
Trapper's still a 115% move speed Killer if he never picks up any beartraps and he always spawns with at least one in hand. RNG only comes in to play with the other trap spawn points and the time required to escape a trap.
---
Freddy literally depends on RNG to use his power to his benefit and keep multiple in the Dream World at a time. If he can't do that, the memes are accurate; his power is hurting him more than it's helping him.
---
Sending thoughts and prayers your way
---
Finessed lol
---
Honestly the biggest gripe I have with NOED is you don't know its triggered until they hit you. All other exposed triggers let you know first. 
---
Wait explain that to me like I’m 5, because i am on p3 nea and waiting patiently for UE3 (it only gave me UE2 in green) and i want 3, and running out of levels before i reach 50, and it seems like you have a loophole but i don’t understand what you just said 
---
By your teammates just sitting next to the hook and not doing gens?
---
That’s what’s I meant
---
Ugliest character in the game (including killers)
---
I don't know if you can do that here, check the rules. That said, Monto was looking for someone to pay for a random perk wheel and curtsin animations. Check his Twitter.
---
Yes insta saw is very fair and requires insane skill to land......
---
I don't think they are.
---
The devs said they were going to reintroduce the new matchmaking system this month.
---
Basically, the game is grouping Survivors up before putting them in a lobby. This is why Survivor lobbies are taking ages, while Killer lobbies are instant.
---
Ah I understand maybe I can try month burns bet he already has way too many offers lol 
---
Oh no he’s heading to the elementary school
---
I love it when I do the last gen in the killer shack and the totem lights up with no ed 😁😁😁
---
This exact scenario happened to me recently, got caught at the door right after opening it, he tries to juggle me to the nearest hook, immediately start wiggling after 3rd drop
---
[Cya never Freddy.](https://i.imgur.com/rLkb9LC.jpg)
---
My take on a couple of your observations:
---
Survivor Perk 3 is an exhaustion perk. If they used Sprint Burst, they'd be exhausted, meaning Motherly Instinct wouldn't take effect. And to time it with the last gen being completed to utilise Adrenaline sounds like more effort than it's worth - more of a trophy/achievement thing if you ask me.
---
Killer Perk 2 only applies to the pallet by which you were most recently stunned, so no need to limit it.
---
Otherwise, fair criticism I'd say. I liked some of the ideas; there are some interesting concepts here that could arguably be used for later perk concepts.
---
Monstrous shrine, because it's monstrou shrine. I would use it instead of BBQ
---
You managed to make Nea uglier
---
You're rank 17. Everyone you're playing with is still learning the game. The killer is very powerful in these ranks, because you're playing with players that probably can't even hit a skill check half the time.
---
Playing survivor at low rank is a huuuuge headache I've played 600 hours and the highest rank I've ever gotten is 2 (The 30 day reset is soooo annoying when you work 40-60 hours a week :() When I play around rank 12-15 my teammates are so boosted barely getting anything done right, constantly going down. Playing killer at these ranks is very simple.
---
You need to just keep playing, don't play to survive play to pip and to have fun. You can easily gain pips by saving others from hooks and looping the killer. 
---
The game is pretty unevenly matched I'd believe that. At low ranks killers are all mighty and powerful because nobody knows what they're doing. At high ranks the killer gets **D E S T R O Y E D** unless they're running META perks like [Ruin](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Ruin), [NOED](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_No_One_Escapes_Death) and playing killers like [Nurse](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sally_Smithson), [Billy](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Max_Thompson_Jr) or [Huntress](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Anna). 
---
If you're having trouble in the game trying playing Claudette she has some of the best perks and clothes. Perks like [Self Care](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Self-Care) are extremely OP and needed for solo survivors. Her clothes make her really hard to see in most realms too.
---
People in this thread need to grow up lmao
---
love these cringe memes on this subreddit, never stop the cringe
---
The hag or spirit.
---
Spirit is top tier if you are really good with her. She is like the nurse.
---
Now that's what I call toxic. 
---
Just out of chance, are you Laurie Chode on the legion legion discord?
---
Drag queen Claudette.
---
Is it expected soon or whats the story?
---
4chan slang became cringey to use a long time ago my friend
---
This whole post gave me a stroke, the timer does pause while you are in a chase, but the legion can look away from the survivor and prevent a chase from starting so that the timer ticks down anyways. You haven’t actually been playing since beta have you? Legions fov is the same as all other killers and his movement speed is the same as hag, huntress, or spirit.
---
Thank you!! Let us rejoice in the fog. 
---
If you have the dlc I'd recommend Spirit, she takes a while to master but once you get the hang of her she's the best console killer IMO, even surpassing Billy.
---
You can do it !!!! 
---
This is too easy of a whoooosh.
---
Is it already time to dig this meme back up? 
---
Yeah and both matches (I'm happy I recorded) 2-3 people said they would report. Happy though, I just played a match and a guy explained to someone that I wasn't lagging but was phasing lol.
---
On PS4 I got Spirit on base game. Didn't need to buy any DLC. Got really disappointed once I bought the game on PC and had no Feng nor Spirit. 
---
True but for 10 bucks I didnt expect a masterpiece
---
99% the exit gate. This is the counter
---
Both of these changes are just horrible ideas. Slightly more movement speed? Exhaustion on a one time use perk??????? Yikes. 
---
Spirit, Idk why everyone is saying she's difficult to play she is such an easy killer
---
Yes, I tgink they're good ideas
---
Thanks, I think I hit them before they actually started the animation.
---
"new"
---
Do you use headphones?
---
Removed - Unrelated Content
---
Continued...(stupid phone posted before I was finished)
---
Unfortunately creating the hatch has then created a new problem.
---
Maybe the best way to deal with this rather than implementing something that helps the killer or makes it harder for the other survivor would be to give last 2 survivors automatic full map bond? This would encourage working together to escape....or they can just both camp hatch.
---
WHAT EVENT
---
THE EVENT
---
15 minimum pallets.
---
Kind of a noob but what does moon walking do?
---
I showed you my ruin plz respond
---
I don’t know how long each of the animations are, but some are longer than others. The Pig’s is one of the fastest, if not the fastest, mori.
---
*chainsaw sounds in the distance*
---
Well since you don't like billy spirit is pretty good too. As for perks you have to go with meta instead of fun (unless you like the challenge and potential of getting genrushed). Also red ranks for killers it is very important to have addons for less stressful games.
---
If you are having trouble with the builds you enjoy and are getting looped more than you should then maybe you shouldn't be at red ranks. Get some more practice in and work on optimal turning as killer and you'll be able to cancel loops a lot quicker. 
---
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT EVENT
---
THAT EVENT
---
(Memes aside, the lunar event, AKA the year of the pig event AKA Chineese new year event)
---
LUNAR NEW YEAR 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
---
T1 myers can catch survivors super easy, since there are less places to run, more walls, and sporadic pallets. Plus, if you run PWYF, the ez pz wall placements make losing someone on purpose a breeze. Though, it's just as good for T2 Myers, I just personally prefer scratched over vanity on any map, especially the Game.
---
OH I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
---
what's supposed to happen. The new update? Firecrackers or something?
---
Look I know it's just a meme but tombstone Myers is nowhere near op. We need to stop with these lies.
---
I would welcome death if I got jumpscared by this beauty
---
have you hit esc?
---
Aka when you make 200 IQ galaxy brain plays where you know exactly what the survivor will do a few seconds in advance
---
God I love being able to run instadown hatchets huntress, omega/multi blink nurse, infinte evil Myers, purple addon sprit, all with an ebony each game \s
---
Oooooh now I like that even more. 
---
You gotta go for a full hex build to assert dominance. It will be a no perk build approximately 3 seconds into the match though.
---
AI should take control over DC survivor/killer. I hope, once they add dedicated servers, that's how it will work.
---
Was all the tbags necessary?
---
DbD on console isn't PC's Low, you can see that by the amount of particles on menu during Winter event for example, Ultra had a lot, Low had way less and console actually had a lot. Also, killer's red stain goes through walls way more on Low than on Ultra, console's red stain is more like Ultra's.
---
Sounds good but devs probably don't add that because its a lot of coding etc
---
Same as the halloween event from what i heard.
---
Because the Entity break the killers from everything, it makes them its puppets. But I agree that it would feel weird to see this giant monster getting looped, I'm pretty sure the Aliens are bigger than most looping structures.
---
It's funny because the only time I receive messages is when a survivor escapes and they say "GG." No other time do I receive messages.
---
 What is the sense to play 3 min because you get  camped/tunneled on the start? 
---
Yeah they should... Just like fix freedy and this tennager with paperplate head
---
DS close to a loop/window, or just holds onto it so I don’t waste it in the middle of an open field.
---
Now what?
---
Why not just make an animation to open the hatch?
---
This comment was made by the meta build swf gang
---
I’m the same but to rando survors who never do gens, honestly they are more dangerous than the killer
---
So, you know a way to fit 20 gens in a map?
---
No !
---
Damn that ass, 
---
Anyone else notice the guy in this picture has the same clothes as The Legion?
---
I haven't played a whole lot in the past 6 months or so (a few games here or there) but unless hag got buffs i doubt she is nurse/billy tier.  I always thought she was like just above legion/wraith/freddy.
---
I had my files corrupted for the game and didn't know how to fix it. Before I did fix it, I qued up with other players with corrupted files. I qued up with the same guy 7 times so we just added each other and played together.
---
What is the update to blood Warden?
---
Might be worth some introspection 
---
The clowns seems to go in forever. 
---
Yes? It's your team...
---
I mean, I was a "silent" Wraith and grabbed Jake from chest, he DCed before I could hook him. You think that's a good enough reason to give survivors completed gen?
---
I feel like I'm in Talladega knights right now.
---
"I said with all due respect!"
---
free bond perk to every player, voice comms &amp; killer balance would be great, but there’s no way bhvr would go through so much work just to better their product. especially with no monetary incentive.
---
Why would he not. He'll get you out of the game earlier. Its your team mate's fault, not the killer's. 
---
I’ve personally stopped playing her till the sounds are fixed, you used to be able to hear footsteps and breathing when she phased now you can’t. 
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night
---
A default gen takes 80 seconds for one person to do barring no fuck ups and no ruin/delay perks.
---
They averaged 48 seconds per gen; thats less than the old 60 seconds before it was increased to 80.
---
His point is its literally the only objective they have, and he cannot break off a chase every time a gen is finished or he spots someone new just to start a new chase; he'll never get hooks that way, and that means no kills. And if he keeps splitting...they'll just do gens injured, like when sloppy was first ran after the heal nerf.
---
Anyone who does not see an issue with this happening is being intentionally blind to the core balance problem of the game; it's not an "option" to run a slow down perk; its a REQUIREMENT.  
---
Than? Only slows gens by 20 seconds, IF all 4 are injured. 6 seconds for 1. Thats...not a lot. In this game, that would've added a total of maybe 20 seconds across all 5 gens since they were doing them with multiple people.
---
Ruin? Well great....if its not found in the first 2 minutes. And even then, most high level players power on through it, if they don't outright hit greats 60-80+ % of the time.
---
Sloppy? Okay....doesn't affect gen speed; people will just do gens injured.
---
Dying light? Well good luck double/triple hooking your obsession (if you even find them quickly, since they get told they're a DL obsession for the entire game from the start) before 3-4 gens are finished, unless you bring a Mori, in which case you're saying the only way to balance core mechanics is with a green/pink mori (RNG item spawn) AND a perk from a paid DLC character.  
---
You see the problem yet?
---
Tips for the shape: you can force a survivor off a pallet camp by stalking. Even if you don't get them to move, you can probably suck out all the evil you can. Abuse your lunge range! It is absurdly long in T3, and it's why Myers is so scary. There's no escape from that range, so try Enduring. You can really absorb some pallet hits in exchange for that instant down. Tuft of Hair doesn't have to be used with Tombstone; in fact, I encourage you do something else! If you want to terrify survivors, the dead rabbit with infinite T3 makes them never feel safe. As the Shape, you can heavily discourage altruism, so while you definitely shouldn't CAMP, you can scare survivors from bumrushing the hook with your T3. Another cheeky but legit strat is to stay in T1 for a bit with Monitor and Abuse, since you can grab people off of gens (walk right up behind them and tap, not hold, the attack button). Your terror radius is small, but with Monitor and Abuse, it is literally non-existent. You also have no red stain in T1. So you can use this for a free hit, or even a free hook, but be warned that you shouldn't chase a survivor in T1, since you're so incredibly slow and your lunge range is almost the same as your quick attack. Try and get to T2 once people know you're Myers. Any of the T3 time extender add-ons are pretty good, but the stalking movement and amount gained while stalking add-ons are pretty good for being in T3 constantly. With the Jewelry Box, if I'm not mistaken, you move just about as fast while stalking as you do when walking. I think you even move faster (or just as fast) than your walking speed if you also add the yellow-tier add-on along with the Jewelry box. I would recommend staying away from the Mirrors until you have more experience, but when you do, try and burn a map offering for Lery's or the Game, since the walls hide your presence easily. One last note: a great way to outplay survivors is to use the Shards, since they let you know where survivors are in a chase, where they're running. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
Can you imagine? Having 40 gens that are halfway done, all chugging away. The noise. Oh god the noise.
---
NEA IS A KILLER (LOL)
---
It's because a vast majority of killers have the childish mindset that if they don't down every survivor within 10 seconds of a chase and get a 4man or get that one specific survivor they wanted that ran them all game then it's somehow a personal slight against them even though everyone is just trying to have fun. It's the nature of the game because both parties's fun comes at the expense of the other and most can't see beyond that. 
---
Yeah, I’ve managed to get into the model folder but never worked out how to properly load into Blender
---
That can allow you to get around BW, but remember that the Killer knows when the gate is open or not with it since it will glow when the gate is open despite not hooking anyone yet.
---
Most Killers I've gone against neglect this indication but I've used it to great effect.
---
Free blood points lol. If they are on fire and you destroy it, you destroy a killer hex perk. All hex perk are put on totems
---
and swag means secretly we are gay (LOL XD)
---
The update was that swd groups can't see perks until the end of the game when everyone left
---
I can't decide between it being the most horrifying or beautiful symphony ever. Probably both. 
---
There are games with the huntress where you can practice for a week, wear two belts, and toss em all and still not hit one. And there are ones where you've not played her in a fortnight, you pop an Iridescent Head for a laugh, and you never miss a beat.
---
Just move the left stick in the down direction lol
---
It sucks, but if you’re getting camped you just have to accept you’re going to die and hope everyone else does Gens. 
---
How much time have you been playing? That's a gimmick build, killers do that to derank without DCing. Hag Guardian of the Chest is one of my favourits. Also Pop the Trap Trapper.
---
Wow, we got a big smartie over here. Everyone look how smart they are. Amazing.
---
Addons on : Nurse, Billy, Hag, Spirit, and Huntress after 2.1 doesnt mean ur bad, but you definitly dont need it at all
---
Yup, conveniently everyone here is writing as if she's somehow fixed when shes still fucked lol.
---
That's why you always play around it like the killer always has it.
---
I know killers are excited about hiding their perks but in reality it won't matter against competent survivors.
---
I only play solo, will always destroy all five totems before even touching a generator, and 99 gates if a survivor goes down before they are opened.
---
I'm not one to dance around the exit. Gate is open and nobody downed? I'm out. Someone gets downed? I'm running over to see if the killer camps, and if they are then I just run back to the gate. By the time I get back to the gate blood warden is gone.
---
Hiding your perks won't do shit against competent survivors. Its just another excuse killers use to justify why they lost.
---
I mean, the semantics of tiering are pretty clear.  How many tournament do you see where 90% of the games are played by nurse, 4% by billy, and 1% anybody else :p  and uh... we dont talk about xbox/ps4
---
What about making NOED a secret offering? And to appease the Killer mains, we could make D-Strike an Item, with Add-ons that can make the struggle percentage less, and an ultra rare add-on that can make you the obsession, and let's you use it as soon as you are picked up.
---
It is the solution. That's how balance works. If there's a scale with a boulder on one end (representing the advantage given by voice chat) and nothing on the other end, (representing the lack of a penalty to *balance things out*), the scale will tip in the direction of the boulder, providing nothing but advantage. You balance it out by adding another boulder of drastically reduced generator repair speed. 
---
Absolutely it would. However the problem is that devs won't balance the game around the fact that you can, indeed, play with friends... with whom you can communicate. Like, obviously. Discord, TS, Skype, you name it.
---
But... You dare to play alone? What did you want, at least a text chat to talk to your other teammates? Herp derp, I'll let you know this game is strictly balanced and designed to be played *alone*, you hear? You can't have that! Stupid. Wait, what is that SWF you talk about? Oh, another lore question, let's get into that instead!
---
Welcome to DbD.
---
Survivors hate playing against him because he is invisible and either downs you if merciful or hits you and leaves you to slowly do anything and fail a skill check.
---
And most killers find that his downsides are way to annoying to enjoy his power.
---
Freddy has the unfortunate case of being considered a weak killer. Don't get me wrong he can still get kills, but it's harder for him. His power makes you wait 7 seconds to attack someone so they have time to open a gate or finish a totem. Not only that l, but his power just let's you track people out of your terror radius, but in a chase he is just a normal killer with no tools to help. People who are dreaming after using his power do things 50% slower and he can see them so tagging multiple people helps. However, if an awake survi or finds a sleeper they can just wake them up by holding left click. Or, if a survior fails a skill check on a generator/healing they wake up. His power relies on RnG alot to work/gives him little to work with.
---
Unless someone is dreaming though you are 100% invisible and your heartbeat is actually his signatureblullaby which is awesome.
---
 Ron Swanson doesn't need d-strike, the killers know to fear him. 
---
Obviously he's bad, he's a KILLER. He is supposed to KILL, anyway possible. Don't be salty. 
---
Kid its ranking game it must have balance not lore
---
Don't tell em just yet. Keep the secrets.
---
let this meme die already i beg of you
---
How stupid are you? What does KILLERS KILLING have to do with lore. THAT'S LITERALLY THEIR JOB, DON'T CRY WHEN YOU CAN'T ESCAPE, YOU FUCKING TOASTER
---
360s still trip me up
---
Ah salty killer main 
---
Seeing as this building has not once caused a single problem for me, gonna’ go with killer lagging, as survivor lagging doesn’t look like this at all.
---
He played perkless at red rank and complained about good players playing well, that's the issue. He didn't complain like this up till this point in the challenge because he rarely came across players of the same level and he got easy pips. Perks obviously would have helped but one game where he just gets unlucky to play against good players who played the objective because he couldn't harass them in any sort of meaningful manner shouldn't be reason enough to call out the whole survivor side of things when he is willingly playing at a disadvantage. 
---
His whole argument is pointless here because someone at red rank would have a meta build to at least play at the same level as the survivors.
---
The problem here is Tru3 got salty over good players playing well when he couldn't do shit all against them without perks and yet he still got 2 kills! 
---
Making gens slower will not resolve the problem. Gens going fast isn't really even a problem. The problem is how they can be so coordinated and get so much free knowledge and free perks. Making gens slower will not only not solve the problem, it will turn players away from the game.
---
I mean he won.
---
He didn't pressure nearby gens, but instead focused the chases. Had he hit more survivors, he may have had a better time with stalling the game.
---
That said, he still won
---
You monster why did u not let them install rush gens and t-bag you, while letting all 4 through the hatch
---
what rank are you because at lower ranks survivors just want people to make brain dead saves
---
I'm sorry, but I'm new to DBD. I constantly see people say "play civ 5 instead" and it seems too specific to not be some kind of in-joke or meme? Can someone explain the whole "play civ 5 instead" thing?
---
What is a good build for legion and huntress w/o other killers teachables
---
There will probably be a gen right next to the hook at this point, so you can do a gen even when hooked. /s
---
People say Leatherface is bad but seriously he has a chainsaw and a lot of perks work well on him because of his simplicity so I don't get why he's bad
---
Ah, salty survivor main. Proper punctuation is important. 
---
If I'm in a lobby with just 2 others for more than a minute or so (maybe shorter?) I'll just leave, I feel this reduces the problem also. 
---
Laughs in OoS looking in a different direction.
---
Hopefully IRL
---
Uh, more please. 😂
---
:O The *horror*!
---
They haven't played her since the update, I guess.
---
I more meant the assumption that it'll be worse with dedicated servers.
---
I'm having trouble deciding what to use my shards on. Would you recommend buying a killer/survivor or using them on perks? Which ones? Thanks for the ama!
---
Cant get a good Huntress build w/o Nurses calling and BBQ sorry
---
Then again it is possible to create a dopamine loop without making it about grinding to unlock more parts of the game. From the list you mentioned, take Overwatch, which while it does have lootboxes for cosmetics it still lets you do everything actually relevant to the gameplay right away. Thus the rewarding part of playing the game can be focused more on the experience of getting better at it, rather than an artificial grind to unlock the full game. Which is sort of where I have a problem with dbd's progression system, I feel it's fair to have a "alright, if I just play this one for X more hours I can show that I am good at the character" (which the prestige system sort of does), dbd falls into the trap of "alright, if I just play this character for 50 more hours I will be able to actually play the character, after which I only need to spend 50 hours per additional character to be able to play them too", which is just ridiculous.
---
I fast vault when the Killer isn't chasing me quite often. As I've explained multiple times now, if the Killer sees me I'll fast vault to gain distance. I usually run Quick and Quiet and Dance with me when I use Lithe, so I can Q&amp;Q+Dance away before the Killer gets close and possibly avoid the chase entirely. If I can't avoid I'll still have Lithe on standby. If Lithe activated out of chase this would be impossible.
---
Auto-activation is why I never use Sprint Burst and rarely use Balanced Landing. I'd like the other two changed to being in a chase only as well so they'd be properly useful, but at the very least I'd like to keep at least one exhaustion perk that doesn't suck.
---
Hah, that's where you're wrong. There's a tutorial. 
---
Or are me and actually are shocked that you see a survivor in your screen when going back to the real world and mess up an easy hit. This happened not too long ago, someone was literally in my face after returning from the spirit world and I got spooked by that lol.
---
I run Enduring on most of my Killer builds so DS is a momentary inconvenience outside of some desperate situation right in front of an open exit. I'd say a good 85% of times I just re-down them in about a 10 to 15 second chase following the drop, if even that long.   
---
NOED, on the other hand, bugs me AS somebody who mostly plays Killer. A Killer can be a gormless stooge the entire game and play terribly and still get charity hooks because their booster seat steroid kicked in long after they should've already had a 2k or 3k.   
---
DS is an annoying Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card, but NOED is "I played badly all game, but I should still get a consolation prize!"  
---
And I say this as somebody who does actively cleanse dull totems when I play my chill-out Survivor matches. 
---
It's not so much a 'mindgame' it's more of a 'I want to be acutely aware of where I am and where the Survivor will go when they DS me'.
---
They better realize that's a horrible idea and scrap it.
---
Entity mistakenly thought she was hooked and ready for being sacrificed, happens to the best of us.
---
thanks, i hate it
---
Atleast your teammates were thinking smart unlike mine. They try to unhook each other infront of the killer with no BT. 
---
Btw the hag most likely shamed them because she could'd of gotten 2 extra kills if they were dumb enough to try rescue you. 
---
If you're only fast vaulting in a chase then changing it is irrelevant.
---
Mate. Not everyone is a swf 4man who can coordinate everything. Stop trying to be a showoff and realise that 99% of the people in this game won't play like that. We aren't doing this for the 1%, it's for the 99%.
---
I'll just ignore PAID DLC killers to try and make you a build, but the shrine is still useable so there isn't an excuse unless it's short term.
---
Huntress: Sloppy, Nurse's, NOED, Brutal Strength/Enduring
---
Legion: Thanatophobia, Sloppy, Nurse's Calling, Distressing
---
I'm rank 3. It doesn't matter what rank you on it happens all the time to me.
---
Is this a double BP event ?
---
I would prefer new killers and perks than maps, but that’s just me.
---
Had a game where four of us popped streamers.
---
Obviously we wanted to see if the killer would like to farm for a match, win win for both sides.
---
One of us ran up to him, it was a billy, shook his head at the guy for a moment then disconnected from the match.
---
Alien killer concept: Grey big headed alien killer, has a space gun, if he shoots you with it you hecking evaporate.
---
Next DLC is already confirmed to be Killer, Survivor and 1 map again.
---
After that who knows?
---
This happened to me today + I was running No Mither. Bitch unhooked me right in front of the killer.
---
You do realize killers were designed to beat 4 people who are working together, right? Try playing with friends, I’m sure you guys won’t be giving callouts every 2 seconds. A lot of killer mains never try surviving and their complaining isn’t valid. Most (like myself) play casually and want to play with friends. This is the only community I know that dislikes the idea of friends playing together and it actually disgusts me. Why play a game if you can’t enjoy it with others?
---
put that thing back where it came from or so help me\*
---
The point is to play with your friends, not make the game massively easier.
---
As it currently stands, the devs have to try to balance the game to have both the killers and survivors have a chance of winning. However SWF skews those chances, and is probably the main reason the devs continue making it harder to play survivor (exhaustion debuff, healing debuff, increased hooks, reduced pallets, etc). This is all well and good for SWF groups, but if you're the only one of your friends who plays it, or you play it without when your friends aren't around, you're put at a disadvantage. Likewise, killers have a much harder time due to SWF, meaning that they're likely to just leave the lobby rather than lose their add-ons on a bad game, or else equip ebony mories to attempt to rebalance the game themselves.
---
Having SWF being able to negate so many killer perks puts killers at a considerable disadvantage, especially if they're having to rush through steam profiles (most of which are private anyway) to find out whether it's worth bringing half their perks. It also means anyone not playing SWF is playing a game balanced for SWF, without the benefits.
---
Most of my playtime on the game is SWF, but I've noticed how annoying the survivor is to play, especially after all the nerfs, without friends around. Likewise, playing killer is infuriating when one survivor seeing your Devour Hope guarantees someone sprinting across the map to take it out before you get a single token.
---
Ciao! :)
---
I wish there was more people like you tbh but it's pretty rare to find some smart teammates on this game. =/
---
Different video yesterday, same story though
---
So... I didn't get my BBQ stack, or BPs for playing vs that Jake, or emblem points (but my Lightbringer will be worse from losing a gen so early), and now one gen is completed.
---
In other words, it's ok to punish killer for making a good play.
---
Noted.
---
Matter of preference I guess but honestly, I'd prefer the devs to hold off on the killers and balance the current ones who desperately need it. While they do this, some new maps could be added to give us new playgrounds to enjoy.
---
Stands for Survive with Friends. It’s a hot topic in the community among killers as it is viewed as an unfair game mechanic due to the fact that this game was designed so that the survivors would not be able to communicate. A SWF group can just hop on Discord/Skype/etc and talk to each other while playing, tipping the scales more in the survivors’ direction as they can tell when someone is being chased, where the hatch is, if a killer is camping, etc.
---
 /s at the end of message means your message was sarcastic.
---
how odd, I could swear I've already watched Tru3's video with nurse. Must have seen it elsewhere then
---
I swear u only see 3 of the maps we already have. I’m forever at auto haven 
---
I play this game like it’s real life, survival of the fittest. If you go down you’re on your own. Sometimes you have to be selfish to save yourself.
---
I don’t think so, either way you gotta be pretty sensitive to report that
---
I have to wonder if people got mad at pig moonwalking/lurking on this reddit when she came out.
---
Yes but this is one of those big expansion map updates that don't require a lot to pay for. $3.00-$5.00 for five maps. I doubt anyone would give a crap about paying for five new maps that could give us more freedom while they create a new killer from scratch and release the killer say four months later.
---
my week is ruined when they have frank's mixtape
---
Oof that's some grinding! Have you done that to all survivors and killers or just this one?
---
Its not that hard if youve got the experience. I made it to R1 this month with Legion. Ive been wanting to do a perkless run. I’ll do it next month. EZ
---
Dat butt tho 
---
*cough*insta heal, purple mist, BNP, insta flashlight, Heart Locket, key which literally lets you skip gens, key+map,spawning next to your objective*cough*
---
The game is being made more difficult for survivors in general, and has been going that way for some months, which I’m totally fine with. What you’re suggesting would break the game and make it nye on impossible to survive as a solo against any half decent killer running those perks. I don’t want to argue mate I really can’t be arsed, and I won’t be responding any more after this, but in this post you’re sounding incredibly entitled. 
---
I'm considering getting Lithe (but I don't know whether to get Feng Min or wait until it comes on the shrine). Are there any tips for using Lithe most optimally in a chase? Akso, my other perks are Bond and Iron Will. What would a good fourth perk be?
---
I mean  someone with 650 hours being rank 20 is no shock, probably hasnt played in a while. 
---
Even if he was deranking he would have to work hard to stay below rank 15 given you cant go past there unless rank reset puts you below there 
---
didnt like motherly insticts and radar that much but they are okay, a rework would be good on these.
---
Only survivor i have fully maxed out is Nea. Trappy boy used to be my only killer maxed out but I really enjoyed playing Legion so i did it for him too. A majority of my survivors are level 40+ for the teachables, and like half of my killers are level 50. 
---
If I go across these survivors as a killer, I will kill the body locker and probably just farm with the rest out of spite.
---
Cloak activate
---
Its stupidly easy to pip in this game if you are aiming to...its hardly impressive
---
Save shards until a really good perk comes up, but if you find yourself with a lot of shards just buy a killer and rank him up until you get your teachable perks. 
---
If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[The mid-chapter patch is today?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ainuzz/the_midchapter_patch_is_today/))
---
Essentially, whenever a player uses decisive strike, it increases their chance of being obsession, so as an obsession, the killer can assume the obsession has decisive (they don't ALWAYS have decisive, but killers assume so, just to be safe). 
---
Here is when juggling comes to play:
---
whenever the killer downs a survivor, and that survivor is the obsession, and once the obsession is picked up, AND is not wiggling, it means they have a chance on escaping with a skill check.
---
So in order to prevent the skill check from appearing, killers start dropping the survivor and picking them up over and over again, closer and closer to a hook nearby. (I refer this as dribbling rather than juggling, but more people use the term juggling)
---
also as a side note, you can always know who the obsession is by looking at the survivors' statuses, and the obsession will have entity claws surrounding it.
---
Max everything out. Do gens, save teammates, and run killer is how you get the most points. There’s a max to every action so even if you do all 5 gens yourself and escape, you won’t have as many points as you could’ve gotten. 
---
Smol Billy is old news, sad Freddy😢 is the shit now
---
Totems: with the killer being unable to see the aura, they can't guard them as well, which is something that often means that survivors can't get rid of the totem at all. That also improves TOTH. Most totem spots are blatantly obvious anyway, and anyone with more than a couple of hours on each map knows roughly where all of them spawn. I only suggest this *because* totems are being hidden so poorly.
---
Knockout: Solo survivors won't (the majority of the time) find the downed survivor within that time limit.
---
And yeah, you've pretty much hit the nail on the head with the others. 
---
When exacly is his hand open? 
---
"cool post, lemme one up you real quick"
---
Deranking Victims Anonymous is here to help you!  
---
I like The Spirit. I'm only on like level 20 with her &amp; I've only played her and Legion, so I only have her kit perks, but I like her a lot.
---
I did use that word as loosely as possible. 
---
I love deathgasm 
---
No they dont, honestly though it should its stupid it doesnt they just havnt updated it after franklins came out. The entire point of the addon is to protect your item
---
Thank you! I took a peek at your profile and your painting is amazing!!! 
---
See i get that, but i also met people as survivor who are really good but deliberately stay in low ranks to annoy/troll new killer players
---
BBQ works like there’s a circle of blindness around you. The higher tiers make the circle smaller, so you see more. 
---
Is this a repost? I feel like I've seen it before.
---
"maxed out but I really enjoyed playing Legion so i did it for him too." you mean them 🤔
---
Do gens ( preferably with another survivor so you get cooperation points), farm your team mates on hooks with "We're gonna live together", heal your team mates, be chased for a long time, cleanse totems, open gate and escape, or even better open gate let the other go and find the hatch.  
---
If the killer is bad and can't catch anybody, or if he facecamp the first guy he could catch, then you're in for a low BP game and you can't do much about it.
---
Maybe similar to f13 where you can only talk to players close to you?
---
How is a bug existing toxic? 
---
you missed the part where the killers would
---
be balanced around these changes. i don’t know exactly what changes would be best, but at least SWF would have a small/null advantage over solo players. that’s the goal here, right?
---
I say him cuz i only ever played joey but now i run p3 frank. I’ve never used the girls. 
---
Yeah, the first one was a grainy vid from my phone. 
---
True but some survivors are too stubborn and will blame you either way.
---
Sure some players do, not much you can really do about it, some players hate high ranks and want some variety. Specifically trying to annoy killers/survivors is shitty though
---
It’s a pain but pretty much you have to go left right down and left down and right extremely fast. It’s all about moving the stick faster than the game can process it. I’ve gotten a few moonwalks none over 2-3 seconds though.

As a survivor it is. As killer, in red ranks, good luck, esp with no perks to control the game's pace. If you want examples, feel free to watch his vods, 4min games on average are not easy to get your stats up in. For longer games, you need perks/addons, so someone being able to reach rank1 without them, this early in the season, is definitely impressive.
---
When you equip Judith's Tombstone. 
---
Yeah playing survivor is aooo hard. /s 
---
I also wish that there would be a system like in cs go or in overwatch where if you keep leaving matches you will be on a cooldown
---
10 x 0 = 0
---
Ive been getting games much better lately, weirdly ranks 10-14 are the worst for queues 
---
You can find it because service that is keeping list of lobbies is still up. It can be in-house solution, it can be third party, like late GameSpy, or SteamWorks. Depends on implementation. 
---

I tried spirit but she’s hard to learn when already in red ranks 
---
Mathew Cote was responding to a rage question in a dev stream and he said "just go and play another game if you are stressed" so ppl will tell you to play another game.
---
"Killer is over here, go for the unhook now"
---
"It's X killer with Y perk and Z addons"
---
"I just used the god pallet so don't rely on it"
---
There's a million circumstances in which SWF gives a benefit over a regular survivor. A SWF with good communication is like running every aura perk simultaneously and then some. I say this as someone who plays a lot of SWF. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good solution to balancing it.
---
Right, I was just using the only obsession perks I knew off top my head as an example. Makes sense, thanks!
---
Survive with friends. u/vk2305 explained it pretty well above
---
thanks for the help everybody
---
Beauty, thank you!

Legion is a matter of debate. A rather cheeky way to play is to moonwalk, so the chase "ends" and the timer ticks down, so you pick Bloodhound. However, Thanatophobia with Sloppy Butcher is a dirty yet effective build. They spend more time healing, and they're facing a Legion, so they face two options: don't heal and do things slower, or do heal and waste a lot of time. Other teachables work too: Hex: Ruin, BBQ, the like. Survivors love to drop pallets early against Legion, so Brutal Strength and Spirit Fury are great choices. Enduring doesn't affect your fatigue time (as far as I know), but it helps for hitting those hits through pallets, especially with your Spirit Fury. Franklin's and Hex: The Third Seal are amazing on Legion specifically, because you hit survivors all the time.
---
Huntress is different, because so much of her game is range and speed. BBQ and ruin work great as always, brutal strength too (survivors often drop pallets early, to avoid getting smacked and hide from hatchets). Iron Maiden works great too, since it reloads your hatchets faster, and discourages survivors from hiding from her even MORE. Because of her low walk speed, Whispers is nice to help save time looking for survivors...or looking for where they're not. Especially because of your odd terror radius. Your radius is 20 m, but your humming is much larger, so terror radius perks are affected by that (such as Diversion) and aren't proc'd by your humming. As a result, Nurse's calling can trip players up, since they aren't always sure about where you are. Your hatchets aren't affected by exposed perks, so be warned. Hope that helps.
---
They stack on the same survivor so be careful as some work against each other ( play with your food and save best for last want you to not hit obsession while remember me and dying light want you to hit and kill obsession)
---
What system? Anytime someone sends me a message along the lines of "kill yourself" on Xbox, I've reported and typically get a message later on saying action has been taken.
---
*Puts Claudette over Quentin's face*
---
The trick to 360's is typically your own skill, but it helps a lot to literally just wait. The trick to a 360 is that, like any circular motion, you eventually go back to the beginning of your arc. So, most the time, you can wait it out, like Dead Hard, and use a quick attack. If they reverse you with a 180, 360 them with your lunge attack (especially with Myers), and auto aim or your own sill can typically rub them hard.
---
Do you want a bunch of Wraith players who don't know what their bell does? Or freddy players, at all? We must help them.
---
Fair enough, chief.
---
So, BMing someone that's stuck from a bug, that they weren't attempting to exploit, isn't toxic? I'd expect that logic from a survivor main! 
---
„Now tbag, it will make you look cool and edgy“
---
Instead of letting it kill the game you could play killer.
---
Killers on PS4 get instantly lobbies and host so no bad connection issues.
---
So how would you even make it away like the photo says?
---
something something sheeple
---
Oh thank you so much! Really sweet comment ^ ^
---
Also tho adjusting those perks for the sole purpose of hindering sfw, it will make it that much harder for solo queuing as they can't communicate and killer is better
---
I dont't get why people waste time to make shitty concepts who will never get into the game out of obvious reasons. just stop doing shitty concepts and let the devs do their work.
---
The killer is already chasing you. He doesn't need to find the hatch. He just needs to down you. But you on the other hand need to find it. 
---
And regarding the blood points. Don't be fucking childish. It's not about the points. It's about escaping. You are already on the hook. You are fucking dying while the other person has to escape. How do you not get this simple logic. You are too selfish. I hope I don't get you as a teammate.
---
I can think of one specific survivor that I wouldn't mind doing this to, so I can see the logic.
---
In a match with 4 party streamers, only about 1 out of 10 games will they actually want to farm.   5 will be genrush deluxe teams complete with bnp + speed gen builds -  out the gate in 5 mins or less.  The other 3 are super toxic and want to bully killer for maximum troll factor.   
---
4 party streamers will always be a DC outside of an event.  It isn't worth the pain.
---
Sorry you feel that way!
---
Lithe and Dance with Me (Kate's Perk)  are a great combo! 
---
&gt; prestiged Freddy (i know I know) 
---
Freddy isn't that bad of a killer as you will read here on the sub. He's a big meme. He's a useless killer though without specific add-ons/perks but he's still a fun and challenging killer. 
---
Welcome to DBD though :D Don't let the toxicity get too deep under your skin and if you start to get mad, take a break and [play some civilization](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/82x5vt/why_do_people_of_this_subreddit_say_to_play_civ/)
---
Mori the Streamer
---
The point of these suggestions is that it doesn't make killer better, only hinders people using things like Discord to get around things in-game. How do you believe it's making it more difficult for solos?
---
Stage 2 is my death. Stage 3 is more like stage 1.5 to me
---
*obligatory reeeeeeing about legion*
---
Got all those BPs from the rage quits against you? 
---
Wonder what the totem improvements were
---
I don't envy BHVR on this issue. SWF definitely needs to be in the game for it to succeed; however, it causes a massive power imbalance most of the time within the same rank. A killer's gameplay experience will vary wildly from one game to the next, and can often be unenjoyable depending on the SWF. If you buff killers to consistently deal with coordinated squads, you alienate the solo survivors. If you "tag" SWF groups in lobbies, their queue times might become ridiculous due to dodging. If you punish dodging, every survivors queue times might suffer. If you offer bloodpoint bonuses to killers when playing against them, killer queues might go wild. There's no good answer here that I can think of.
---
2/5 is 40% my dude. You're barely doing the majority and then getting out for free.  If you can't see why that's broken then stop replying to me
---
I’m just excited to read the patch notes and for the new cosmetics if they ever drop. My boy dwight needs his pizza delivery bike outfit lmao.
---
Ah shucks, her ability description probably says that too huh :/ probably shoulda read a little closer beforehand 
---
Console (ps4) as well. Just downloading 1.016 GB.
---
when i play killer i spawn i see the totem across the map and i think to myself 'yep, ruin's gone' everytime , when you go survivor i dont waste time looking for ruin, so like 50% of the times we end up finding ruin after 4 gens are made.
---
Y monstrous shrine?
---
my favourite is, when they accuse me of camping/tunneling, insisting on denying (especially when i did).
---
unless they're accusing me of hacking, in that case i'll do the opposite.  
---
just be polite and thank them for the points
---
I think survivors hate me playing legion because its zero effort 50k bp in 10 minutes. :)
---
But I did have Borrowed Time so he was safe anyway - I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t have that
---
They talked about it on stream. Its an algorythm change for totem placement if I remember correctly
---
Someone on Xbox got the update it looks like 
---
How about console? (I'm sneaking my question out of nowhere). Or if you know the answer you may prefer I post a comment and you reply there so viewers find the answer easier.
---
Legion buff oh boy
---
Xbox user here, I tried getting online today, and it says I need a patch to play? It’s never asked me this before so I don’t know what to do.
---
Yeah, already installing. Got impatient.
---
&gt;After seeing the positive reaction to higher rarity items being looted from chests during the Winter Solstice, we've updated chest drop rates to support this after the event ends.
---
Ooh gimme dem goodies
---
That's good analysis. You could do it so only the highest rank in a SWF factors in to determining the killer rank. Rank 20s who never play will still be able to play with rank 1 friends, it just means games will be harder, and it prevents bullying low rank killers
---
608MB on PC.
---
You will prob still get stunned 
---
Yeah it’s glitched
---
Steam should disable negative reviews for people who play on free week end.
---
I like his design. :P 
---
Wait so gen speeds as a team were nerfed.
---
"Fixed an issue with generator repair efficiency for multiple Survivors working on the same generator. The efficiency debuff (-10%) should now be applied at the correct rate."
---
This means Prove Thyself just makes the speeds what they were in 2.4.0 if 2 or more people are on the same gen with the perk.
---
If you look at the bottom left you will see a yellow package labeled "TRUMP" and then see part of Yugi's face...  
---
A patch just went live on PC. I'm not sure exactly when it's coming to the xbox but I assume very very soon, so I'd just hold tight, and try again soon.
---
Yeah, I just checked and the PS4 update is downloading now too.
---
I read them a while ago, I'm kind of torn on this one. Yeah, at keast you got something. My boy David got forgotten. I thought the Ace cosmetics werenfor David when I saw them. Quite disappointed.
---
People hate legion because he takes no skill, cheese chase mechanics and is generally annoying to go against due to all the mending. Hopefully he will be deleted.
---
Actually, I rarely get dc’s as legion. I feel like that whole epidemic of “Legion is insane” can only be applied to PC players. Just like a vast majority of stuff wrong with this game. Different console, different problems 
---
No need to get so angsty dude, chill out a bit.
---
But maybe we can also talk about the matches that end in 4 minutes because the killer has sacrificied/moried everyone. They feel much more common in all honestly.
---
Kindred should be a base perk.
---
Does Whispers actually do anything? I havent noticed a change in anything when using it
---
Right but if the spawns are crap the algorithm isn’t much. Personally I wanna try and see how the game would be if totems didn’t glow at all. Then hexs would be much more useful
---
That's top trumps, a card game
---
I don't think it's a UK only thing 
---
I honestly think we wont get legion rework unless we get freddy and nurse first so see ya in ten years pal lol

Okay, thanks so much!
---
What. If you have 2/5 gens, the hatch won't spawn even with a key. A key doesn't magically make the hatch spawn quicker. It still has the same requirements. At that point, you don't even need the key, so I kinda fail to see why you think it is broken.

I think you should be able to swf but it takes the high with highest rank rather than average.
---
The visual change is an underrated buff. The few times you could juke a legion were likely due to his blur that just got lessened.
---
Correct.
---
i don't even remember her noise, must be quite unremarkable.  
---
myers on the other hand :,)
---
Yeah well. What you are doing now might end up preventing you do something later. Just saying if you spend 10 years playing computer games and in your mid 30's decide you want to educate yourself to get better job, things won't be so easy for you as they would've been when you were in your early 20's. You can always play computer games later but you probably won't land a job even if you get a degree when you're 40.
---
It's why my messages are still blocked even though the PS4 message bug was patched a while ago. Don't have to deal with salty teammates who are mad I didn't sacrifice myself to save them from Insidious Basementface or, as Killer, Survivors who played badly and are mad I didn't just look the other way.
---
I meam that is the entire point of legion. You arent safe in a chase with him. Its the point.
---
Every time a killer drops you, the wiggle bar gets partially filled. By the third time around, it only takes like a second of wiggling to free yourself. 
---
8.11 GB on Xbox one 
---
Yup just got it now sweet
---
I seriously though those ace cosmetics were david cosmetics. Well, hopefully they’ll release more stuff. Tbh, if the event allows us to get one of the survivor outfits. I’d probably get the feng min one since, it actually looks rather good. But, I’m torn since ace was my main until I switched to dwight. Give it abit my dude, there’ll be many more awesome cosmetics when the next chapter drops. Since were pretty much mid chapter patch.
---
5 seconds if you bring a Jigsaw Piece offering.
---
Can anyone give me a quick rundown of the key? I have a few in my inventory and never know when it's good to take it into a match. Am I playing to last until the hatch spawns? Do I need an add-on to use the key? 
---
What about the map? Is it completely out of the meta?
---
I meant, the devs would chance how the emblem works and there wouldn’t be any harm in losing the generator
---
It actually feel closer to 40% miss rate to me as killer. But I find that I actually dont see DS TOO often unless it is an SWF. I sometimes go 2 or 3 games in row with no obsessions at all.
---
DS isn't all that bad either. I almost always catch them again within 20 seconds after getting DS'd. I have rarely "lost games" because of DS. It isn't the op perk many complain about it being
---
Just read the wiki. "Launched in 1978, Top Trumps was a card game popular with adults and children in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s," 
---
Yeah I've never seen any top trumps packages in USA, I'm sure they're sold here too but they're just not as popular here. 
---
Yeah, but you should nerf the perk that are too strong and that don't require any skill to benefit from.
---
And 500 hours of "Copying..." lol
---
How in the world is that skill check hard i hit with 95% accuracy and i play killer more. The perk’s counter is so situational you can just dpnt die near a hook and suddenly you have a free escape you didnt do anything to earn.
---
Is your game bugged or something? Why does it look like that?
---
You still get stuned.
---
Another meme 3rd graders think is funny.
---
Unpopular opinion. Survivors have op items and add ons as well. 
---
Ah, didn’t see that. My bad
---
There is. I think gradually we could shift solo survivors into swf- give them the same power. Then we can balance killers stronger, make them faster. Etc. 
---
It's up now 
---
I honestly believe mlga breeds toxicity because it gives the mindset that we are allowed to judge each other based on our one sided opinion of gameplay.
---
Well, it does exactly what it's supposed to do. It gives you an audio cue when you are within x meters of a survivor. In addition to the audio cue, the perk will also light up.
---
Hidden in the shadows
---
For this small update no more than a few mins but ya that copy thing is annoying lol. 
---
Yeah this makes no sense. Why do you need to be chased in a game where you're supposed to stay hidden to go up a rank?
---
There is little to no counter play to legion. That is why people hate playing against legion. 
---
You didn't read, I was saying you're skipping 2(40%) of the 5 gens. That's 2 people easily getting away for free. You didn't need to waste your time typing this out if you read it right. 
---
And I'm done here, if you can't see why it's broken then go play some high rank killer. You'll see why 1/2 gens matter
---
Here is some of my gameplay.
---
https://youtu.be/4TIGSn8MxiU
---
They can put totems closer to objects/walls now so it's harder to see them.
---
They also talked about a "sight-check" when spawning in the game so a survivor should never spawn in sight of a totem, this hasn't been implemented to the game yet though.
---
Why is it silly to argue that legion should take skill to hit someone? Every other killer has to earn their hits, legion is gifted them. Delete Legion
---
Just play as killer. This is what happens when everyone wants to play as survivor. Just do the community a favour and keep it alive by playing as both killer and survivor often 
---
This is definitely not as easy as some would like to say.   
---
Well done by Tru3, of course.   
---
Chat in his stream went ballistic when he got to rank 1, calling him the best killer in the game etc.
---
This, by no means, means that he is the best killer in the game.
---
This has been done multiple times, by multiple streamers and non-streamers.  
---
Just last rank reset, I believe, a lesser known streamer (Dowseytv) did this. 
---
Remixed volume levels for footsteps, music &amp; VOs.
---
Footsteps back then ?
---
I love using her. She's the only Killer I've ever reached Rank 6 with haha. Anyways, some very basic and general tips I can give are:
---
* Wear headphones. You can still hear footsteps/bushes/injured Survivors in Phase mode. 
---
* When you're phasing to a Generator to check on it, keep close look on the surroundings/listen for movement. A smart survivor won't stay on the Gen if they hear a Spirit phasing, so looking for rustling grass/plants/scratchmarks are a good way to find and hurt them.
---
* Any add-on that decreases the "cast time" of Phasing, use it. The faster you can phase during a chase, the better. Plus it helps with mindgames.
---
It just means pallet trick against legion won't work anymore. 
---
Pallet trick was...
---
Sit at pallet &gt; get hit by frenzy &gt; stun legion while keeping a full timer 
---
making the chase last longer and preventing multi hits. This counter play is now gone he can now run up to the pallet you are camping, cancel and you will have to run from the pallet and get hit by the frenzy double hit or take a standard M1.
---
Okay well, lets hear how BNP is broken. I wanna hear how overpowered an 8K addon doing 15% of a gen with two hard skill checks is. 
---
I wasn't sure if it reached the US or not, but a for effort on the joke, I respect that. They're about as popular as president trump nowadays
---
I thought I heard them say on their last stream it was meant to be like this but wasn’t working for what ever reason. 
---
If they didn’t get stunned they would be bugged to nurse tier lol
---
The patch is live everywhere but they haven't released the patchnotes for console yet (they aren't much different anyway).
---
608.3MB GEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ!
---
I don’t understand all the legion hate. It’s designed to win chases and hit survivors, so just run a few key combos of perks (thanatophobia &amp; Franklin’s demise are nice) and and you can give the survivors a super tough time getting anything done. And I can’t say it takes no skill as I’ve seen incredibly few good legion players 
---
Try hard reseting your xbox so the patch shows up!
---
1.016GB on ps4, 
---
Non Toxic squad where you at? 
---
&gt; Or, if a survior fails a skill check on a generator/healing they wake up. 
---
To me that's the aspect of it that's kind of BS. I get it, loud bang is scary, hurting someone while trying to perform first aid can cause someone to recoil, but it's just shitty that they can run up to any gen and just fail a skillcheck.  
---
I've never had to play against a Freddy yet, though, so I don't know how often skill checks pop when playing against him, though.   
---
I feel like they should remove the skillcheck fail as a means to wake up, and make it so sleeping survivors can wake each other up to balance it.
---
&gt;Manually ending Frenzy no longer depletes the remainder of your Power gauge.
---
My right click fat fingering thanks you.

&gt;Badham Preschool: Now forcing a hook to spawn in the back of the preschool school if the basement is not there.

&gt;Survivor perk changes -clip-
---
Dwight mains rise up!
---
&gt;Hidden Killer Loadout: Removed the ability for Survivors to view the Killers perks, add-ons and offerings in the tally screen during an on-going match. Killer information will be revealed once all Survivors have exited the match.
---
Better late than never, huge thanks!
---
&gt;Item Interaction: Items found in chests without already holding an item now require being picked up. This makes the interaction consistent with when you have an item already in hand and allows you to see what you have found before you commit to picking it up.
---
Now I never have to feel bad being forced to touch a flashlight!
---
&gt;Mori Icon: If The Killer has played a mori offering, the offering's icon will be displayed in the in-game HUD when the conditions are valid and they are standing over a downed Survivor.
---
Assuming this means a skull icon shows up on the health states panel like broken does. so much for moris being "secret" I guess.
---
Bring on the hatch keys.
---
&gt;Bug fixes -clip-
---
Hallelujah!
---
But it still sucks when the hook is close and you dont have time to wiggle. 
---
ive had inv gens and killers but never hatch, learn something new everyday lol 
---
Thank you! I’m going to have to go home and look at them to completely understand which ones are the hexes, but I understand the basis. The hexes the reusable perks?
---
Clea and Neadette
---
I think a lot of people, at least the ones I play with, hate playing against Legion because a) its boring b) it drags out the game.  After so long, I get tired of running away from him, having to mend, getting back to a gen, getting chased and hit again, having to run, mend and go back.  I dont want to be in a game of DBD for 30 plus minutes.

---
So he’s calculated his chase to account for his lack of pressure, allowing the survivors to complete the generators? Adrenaline is a win-more perk. If the killer pressures enough that they never power the gates it never activates. Adrenaline is a reward for surviving long enough and having your chase last long enough for all of the generators to be completed.  
---
Decisive Strike and NOED are perks that activate when you’ve played poorly and give you bonuses you don’t deserve. The Killer didn’t keep survivors off generators, so he’s “rewarded” with 1-hit downs and movement speed. The survivor didn’t evade the killer, so he’s rewarded with another health bar. These two perks are poorly designed for the reason that you get a reward when you’re actively in a losing position. 
---
Update just popped up!
---
I mean i dont agree. Legion left clicks same as everyone else. He's just got the advantage of having an easier time getting close. And if were talking about gifting hits let's not talk about trapper :P
---
Awesome. So leave the spirits lamps alone and be aware that getting one-shotted isn’t them hacking

---
Yes but no killer should be, “designed to win,” every single chase without fail. It takes away from the main reason people still play this game, the interactions between killer and survivor. 
---
If I lose all ability to win chases against a killer I’ve basically just lost my entire reason to even play the game. 
---
Downing survivors as legion takes no skill, to deny that is pretty questionable as his power does what nurse does without the downside of potentially missing a blink. 
---
It was indeed.
---
I also got blood warden from the shrine, but must have been like a year ago
---
which is completely fine, it’s a game about cooperation. but you can’t ignore that the current mechanics of playing survivor are based on the assumption that you are not communicating with other survivors. perks like bond, empathy, kindred and knock out are purposefully designed around this assumption as well and become completely irrelevant when voice comms are used. idk about you or others, but i feel uncomfortable when playing against SWF when these advantages are present.
---
If hex totems didnt glow, youd never know which one was a hex
---
Pokemon at least does something original, cod is the same overused shit. UUuuuuuh lets make... A GENERIC SHOOTER! And for the next year... lets make... A GENERIC FUTURISTIC SHOOTER THAT FAILS IN EVERYTHING IT DOES! And the next year... etc.
---
What about Chaser and Malicious? They'll suffer too. Change them too? What about bloodpoints? Them too? Just because some survivors can't be bothered to actually play the game?
---
Dont rely on crutch perks. I'm a hag main and the only Hex I use is Third Seal. If I want to meme, I'll bring Haunted Grounds.
---
Agree. Having this example be without perks or add ons is stupid, all it really shows by the fact he still got 2K is how broke PC nurse is! That’s my takeaway. Playing at red ranks naked against what was likely a sniping SWF with very strong loadouts proves nothing else.
---
It's so annoying! Literally takes three times as long as downloading.
---
But in time people will know the spawn points anyway won’t they? Like on the Freddy map I swear nine times outta ten the hex totem is in Freddy’s bedroom
---
Tombstone piece better 
---
Legion can whiff 10 hits and still hit you, hes a joke.
---
Glad to find yet another bug in this wonderful game. 
---
The downsides are that it takes 4 frenzy hits to down and double hitting stops your power. Top that off with no scratch marks during it and survivors can easily escape unless legion runs bloodhound

I dont want to sound mean but dude he won't get deleted. Nurse still exists and is far more powerful. Plus people played extra money for him. Taking him away would mean required refunds on a massive scale.
---
I play legion at multiple rank levels there is counter play... stealth in particular. Staying separated and working on gens while keeping an eye out.
---
That’s the idea. Then people will actually cleanse totems and slow the game down a bit. Taking a perk away from someone and essentially cutting 25% of their power shouldn’t be as easy as this. Plus people already are to lazy to cleanse totems to counter noed. Get ppl doing that and suddenly noed becomes a lot less complained about. 
---
I'm getting better with Legion. Running Bamboozle seems to help. :D
---
*What? I'm supposed to spend time and do work in a videogame?!*
---
*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*EEEEEEEEEE***EEEEEEEEE*****EEEEEEEEE**
---
The fact that you maxed out Nea.. I forgive you for your sin you posted here
---
He left clicks on a severely reduced cooldown than everyone else while moving at a faster pace than everyone else while being being up to deal with pallets and windows faster than anyone else.
---
He ruins all the fun a chase usually brings.
---
Delete his power then and give him 1% movespeed sorted 
---
Well no, a post like this was made yesterday only it said my first p3 character. The layout and format is nigh’ identical and the dude yesterday was clearly going for hate mail. 
---
Can you not rebind things on console version? I guess its not a very common feature for console games but thats pretty wild.
---
I don’t really think it will. If gens are being finished that fast, then that means survivors are soloing the first three for sure, and likely the last two (someone might double up on one of those.)
---
The efficiency debuff is only applied when co-oping a gen. 
---
&gt;This won't help bad Legio players at all.
---
It helps me constantly fat fingering the right click, although I still screw myself out of scratch marks. :\
---
I said the same thing in that video lol
---
Billy whiffs over half his chainsaws, and only needs to hit once instead of 3 or 4 times. Is that okay in your opinion?
---
&gt; Adjusted the camera position for the Hag, Legion (specifically Julie and Susie), Nightmare and Pig.
---
These are all the short killers, so does this mean they moved it higher? Do I have a chance to see things in corn maps with Hag now?! 
---
I’ve been looking for it for the past 20 minutes. Nothing shows up on my update screen. I even reset my console. Any idea how to fix it?
---
&gt;Feature - Added controls to change characters in the lobbies and the store without accessing the character selection panel.
---
JESUS THANK YOU!
---
I can't properly express how happy this makes me. As someone who likes to 'prep' bloodwebs by leaving them with 1 or 2 nodes left, having to go back to the character menu everytime to see who  was left was maddening. 
---
Now I can quickly flick through all the characters and see who still needs work.
---
Consider playing a single player game if you don't like your opponent actually trying to win.
---
A pretty bad perk turned into a maybe good perk. 
---
I would agree. I see a lot of doctor hate for the same reason. Not because it is guaranteed death but because it takes a lot of extra sidework.
---
LWIAAAHHH
---
Hes even lucky he got the unhook
---
Still don't really like the postgame loadout screen change from a purely solo survivor standpoint. I guess it doesn't really matter but sometimes I'm curious AND impatient. Oh well.
---
R.I.P
---
And nobody wants to be gen rushed.
---
Except they aren’t that strong. There’s a reason nobody goes hunting for them. Only ones you see are ruin and noed majority of the time. You can easily counter ruin without even killing the totem.  I can run selfcare to completely negate the killers progress for example and he can’t take that away from me. He can run hex to slow my progress with skill checks but I can just gen tap and avoid skill checks all together and only. Lose a few seconds
---
In normal T3, he has his knife raised and his other hand closed - if it's instead open, that means he's ready to instakill.
---
It’s not from in game, just the models used in another software. I’m not sure which exactly though.
---
The only time I've seen that happen, was when someone was mori'd where the hatch was going to spawn. Later on when the hatch was "available", the noise played but the actual hatch wasn't there. I wonder if maybe the DC caused that to happen?
---
The time in between pings on the gen is increased with tiers, meaning that at tier one you get a more constant and accurate flow of information. 
---
Well, if you wasn't found even once though wasn't downed, you will get Iridescent Unbroken. 4 gens will result in Iridescent Lightbringer too, thats definitely a pip.
---
But you also won't get much points this way. 
---
You should also note that with a key you need to finish a certain number of gens before it will spawn: the number of remaining survivors plus 1. So if all 4 people are alive you need all the gens done in order to use the key on the hatch. If only 2 of you are left, you can get it with 2 gens remaining.
---
Also, if you open the hatch with a key it stays open for anyone else to use for only 30 seconds. 
---
I gotta take what I can get, for now I just slug the ds unless I'm in a good spot to counter it, I don't get upset when I get gen rushed, and don't use ruin without a means of protecting it.
---
Billy then has to rev his chainsaw up again and then hit you with it. Yes im fine with it. Legion can miss follow you over a vault miss again three times and then still hit you all in one power usage. Backrevving one guy with billy actually requires skill unlike cheesegion
---
Its a multiplayer game, it makes sense that the game awards for multiplayer interactions. Coop, chase, escaped, protection, hooked, safe rescue, and other stuff. 
---
Hag and trapper counter them yea, i wasn't arguing that no one else counters them. You can argue that some killers deal with pallets and windows faster if you want, but legion still vaults faster, while moving faster, while having a shorter attack cool down than anyone else.
---
Bottom line is its not fun for survivors to have a killer that nearly auto hits. You can keep trying to get people to like him, but its not going to happen. The majority will always think hes an no fun, no skill killer unless he gets the rework he desperately needs.
---
I love lithe, as they said it works better on x maps, and i guess it works better against x killers than sprint burst/Dead hard (And backwards) (kinda a rock,  papper, scissors game in my opinion).
---
Self-healing is always wortz unless you gonna run no mither xD.
---
She has a white coat.

---
Exposed.
---
yup, LONG and boring matches...mend, mend and mend some more that is assuming you dont get tunneled.  But wait, more mending if that happens too.  Kind of funny how instead of being scared of a killer, I am like oh shit, here comes the mending and chases you have little chance of escaping.  I think he/she is more annoying to match than the Doctor.
---
&gt; Do you have a source for totem formations?
---
Totems spawn in a sort of a circular pattern, if i find one i'll know where the rest are. It's something i've picked up with having put stupid amount of time into this game ;)
---
They added the Spies in the Shadows buff.
---
Goodbye everyone. I’m playing Pig for 8 hours straight.
---
yep enjoy 
---
What about it? Suck it up and take solace that they'll be temp banned and can't ruin anyone elses game. Matches are less than 10 minutes, losing one match from a DC isn't a big deal, as long as people are punished for it.
---
I did too, but someone corrected the info. Yeah, I guess for the next event the other survivors will grt their cosmetics and it will be Daveyboi time. Ace cosmetics are the best cosmetics imo.
---
Janet!
---
that is true but at least with a Nurse you have a chance of juking and losing her. Legion, not so much...he is brainless heat seeking missle, which if you think about it. Is pretty accurate when in feral mode and attaching a survivor LOL
---
The totem rework basically has happened. In this patch, they changed the interactions so that totems can be hidden basically anywhere now, instead of in plain sight. Expect to see actually decent spawns soon.
---
Yeah its only fun to troll when I'm swf, like when I know its haunted grounds and I say "Buckle up" and break it. XD
---
You either run away and trigger all the traps or start crouching away and the Hag just walks back up to the hook and downs you anyway.
---
Ive given up with ruin with the new ptb out ive started with blood warden and its easily become my favourite killer perk 
---
I just want Remenber me back, i'm not going to purchase Freddy xD
---
Kill me now
---
damn highest rank ive gotten to is 9 on survivor mainly because i dont play the game enough each month
---
And what about solo players that aren't even that good at the game that are being nerfed unfairly to try and balance a game that quite clearly has two difficulty settings? There's ranks in there for a reason, so that you get matched with people of similar skill. The things I've suggested is so that playing SWF over solo doesn't just negate a quarter of the killer perks. If you have to play with friends in order to keep your rank, that's not *your* rank, and your rank will be adjusted to reflect *your* skill.
---
hence the long boring matches :( 
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
He doesn't see your scratches, try to break line of sight. I've gotten away a bunch of times doing that. Bloodhound counters it but not all legions use that.
---
Ayyyyy!!!!
---
I hate to say it and even though this review is pretty inflammatory, I usually do not play games for the grind as well. In fact, I consider it to be quite annoying. And If I just started and had to either spend money or level up to get important perks, I'd be slightly annoyed. Back in the day I used to play Wc3, Sc2 and similar games without really leveling up anything. The only thing we got was a profile picture back then.
---
Neither are most killers 
---
swf is a mechanic they need to remove i only play survivor solo and every time i get hooked when everyone else is a swf they leave me to die, im rank 3 and with this constantly happening im just tired of it, its not how the game was meant to be played
---
Terror radius, no, while in a chase, absolutley should not bleed out. 
---
It would be the same thing if the reverse bear traps counted down while you are being chased. They dont, so you shouldn't be able to bleed out in a chase either.
---
WAAAHH
---
I mean that's assuming his power lasts long enough and you don't stun him. But okay.
---
Why not both!
---
Hopefully in the shitstorm of 8 gigs there’s optimization somewhere
---
That’s like saying you don’t need to bring an item if you’re a survivor? Iris head or 5 blink is op for sure but bringing addons doesn’t make you bad or anything.
---
10% of 80 seconds is 8 seconds. Not that it's that much more substantial, but it's still considerable. Early on people should work separately, while later in the game people should congregate
---
Stop the strawman BS. **Literally** ***no one*** cares if you play with your friends. Play SWF all you want. No one gives a fuck. It's when you introduce **voice chat** to a game designed not to have communication outside of 2 basic emotes that issues arise. Your argument would be akin to a Killer saying "I don't get why people don't like me using wall hacks when I play. I'm just playing casually, I don't want to waste time looking for people."
---
If the only thing you enjoy about DBD is talking to your friends then you could literally do that in *any* other game. Why do it in the one game not designed for it? A lot of Survivor mains never try Killer, so never realize how game breaking even casual communication really is, and their complaining isn’t valid.
---
You'd think that would be to implement. I mean, hey a player is literally hitting the exit match button.  Easy to track...right? Maybe not for BVHR. They would probably get the code wrong and all players who didnt DC would be on cooldown LOL 
---
It’s really bad, even on the ps pro, I moved over to pc and it much better. Helps that I have a 1070, but using keyboard and mouse is hard
---
Surveillance is quite good now, havent checked spies
---
4 seconds* that's double the amount of 2, meaning we were nerfed by 200%!!!  
---
  
---
When has any game ever had such a massive nerf?? Poor survivors smh  
---
(just kidding tho)
---
#ReworkLegion
---
I've never seen her wear it tho :/
---
Oh yeah I know, but NOED works multiple times as long as the totem is up. DS only works literally once. I never run it, because it's such a stupid perk. I don't even understand why surviviors think its so strong and why killers hate it. Ive gone against numerous people who have DS. I let them get the hit and then chase them down again and boom they no longer have it. I don't have a problem tracking survivors, but I guess others do.
---
I don't believe so. On the PTB these camera positions were bugged for these killers, and I know on leary's the pig camera POV was way too high. I think this is meant to be a bug fix. 
---
Devour hope is fine, haunted grounds is fine. Lullaby needs a buff as does third seal. This doesnt effect the fact totems exsist because the perks are too strong to stay up 
---
Idk if they pasted but I’ve seen a bug for billy that his weapon is just Claudette’s face
---
LoS jukes mate.
---
The third perk says nothing about it not working while Exhausted which is why I worded my opinion the way that I did. To my understanding it would cause Exhaustion but would still work if you were Exhausted. If the intent is to make it not work while Exhausted then it should be worded better, but it still doesn't stop the fact that it is very easy to use this thing (especially in a SWF) and if a Killer needs to kill a specific Survivor for whatever reason (Dying Light is an obvious example) this is a massive kick in the teeth. Granted that's the intent quite clearly but still. And if you're in a SWF and know that Adredaline will go off this perk would cause dozens of Killer main DCs.
---
I think Acid Blood only applying to one pallet is rather weak. It could easily apply to the last 1/2/3 pallets akin to Surveillance. I also think that breaking the pallet is good enough and it really doesn't need to injure the Survivor. Spirit Fury already shows that being able to Ctrl + X a pallet out of the game is already super powerful.
---
Is there a patch download right today? 
---
Bang

---
Oh, yeah then. That's what I meant. 
---
This template is from the paleozoic. The mammaries.
---
I still think that it was really well done and that you clearly put a lot of effort into it. I think with a bit of tweaking it could easily be made into a workable concept. It's not astounding but for the idea it works well and there are some fun concepts in this bundle that are belivable to be added to the game.
---
Killer main that has started playing survivor more. Question is, I noticed that if I am up against a relatively inexperienced killer (I.e. not putting good pressure on the gens) my team and I can usually get all the gens done pretty quickly and escape. In these kinds of games, I go through maybe one chase, and am lucky to get one unhook. When this happens, I barely get any BP and I’ve had a few instances where I didn’t pip.
---
Is there any way to combat this? I hate feeling like I “lost” a game because the killer was too inexperienced to really do anything to stop the survivors. 
---
Did lunar new year start?
---
Spies from the shadows is about to get buffed. 
---
20 minutes ago after the game played it started to download. (ps4) it's 1GB 
---
Repost?
---
That would be terrible, survs could duplicate items that way
---
Damn Surveillance is also gonna get buffed. 🙃 
---
Not\_Queen said that there was an idea for solo survivors to see the loadout, and SWF couldn't. They couldn't do it however due to limitations. Maybe they'll include that feature with dedicated servers? In any case, I think the change was for the greater good, and I couldn't be happier that they (finally) did it. 
---
dude just put your controller down gently 
---
So you're saying that even though in most regards he is weaker, the specific combo of things he does is hated and people hate the exact thing he is meant to do? Yikes. 
---
Funny how he was garbage just a week ago
---
Yeah it's at the top of the notes.
---
Legion Legion rise up 
---
"Why can't we play with our friends" is the main defense I see and it's such strawman BS that it tells me many recognize the advantage so try and deflect the point of the argument to something they can actually defend.
---
Honestly 40 doesn't sound like enough 
---
The thing is you can hear a crow trigger 48 meters away, go there and the survivor will be gone for a long time. It is kinda annoying hearing explosions everywhere too.
---
Its a bug with the new unhooking system, usually it just results in a hit but lag probably played a role in them being grabbed.
---
I mean I ain't seeing doctor hate and he takes longer, but what do I know.
---
Gotta taste them fingers.
---
Photoshopped.
---
How is this the killers fault? 
---
I thought it was next Tuesday all along. I dont expect anything today. It usually runs for 2 weeks and Chinese New Year isn't until February. 
---
This games players would skyfall if they remover swf
---
That's the way the game is designed. That's how **BHVR intends it be played.** Why is that so hard to understand?
---
Yah I was off by a week patch just dropped 
---
What?Did you just decide to post a 4k hoping for what exactly?
---
Could it be? Some kind of reference?!
---
Used it a bit on the PTB. Not bad, gives some good info. Helps finding survivors in chases when they break line of sight, but its not much more useful then simply following scratch marks/blood trail. 
---
"ah fuck it, I might as well join you guys" 
---
When did the last Chinese New Year event start? I can’t remember I think it was before February 5th 
---
The doctor hate has subsided alot of the years. He was hated a lot at release, just because of how annoying hit shock is and how the effect last so long. 
---
Jeff+Aftercare is the opposite of Adam+Deliverance. Everytime I play with an Adam and get hooked I know I'm coming back to the hook.
---
Hm. I only wondered because it’s mentioned on the PS4 patch notes, but that makes sense. 
---
I like this idea
---
Alright kid, here's more proof.
---

---
I'm pretty sure it will change your mind.
---
The guy just go Afk where the last 2 teammates were, that cost them the game or the chance to escape
---
Haunted ground is pointless unless you are running something worth protecting and even then it’s 2 perk slots just to keep one up so ur still potentially wasting 2 slots. Dev hope is pointless. Games can sometimes end without it ever coming into play even when it’s not cleansed. None of the perks are that strong except maybe noed and that’s only strong if survivors are to lazy to cleanse a totem. Ruin is ok but it’s only being run because the game ends in 5 minutes if they don’t and even then it only pushes it back a little bit assuming it’s not found in the first 30 seconds. Now if you actually stop doing gens to find the totem then it’s doin some work maybe but if you put in the time to master great skill checks it’s a waste of a perk. And if you can’t hit a great skill check you can still gen tap your entire gen for litttle to no loss of time still making it mediocre perk. 
---
This is the event https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Moonrise
---
Ohhhh I can definitely see how that makes things easier 
---
Suprisingly Legion isn’t spammed on console. It’s mainly Huntresses and Hags
---
I think OP wanted to show how the AFK surv gave away the location of the other 2 survivors with the crow notification. Still he could have ended right there but wanted to flex.
---
Okay I believe you. Please don't hurt my family.
---
I mixed it, and I'm playing Jeff with Adam's perk. But I'm not a good player, so I don't know if it should be played like that :D 
---
"yeah borrowed time only effects campers"
---
Can anyone confirm if sounds are actually fixed? Specifically for killer? I can't play until later and am just curious. Thank you! 
---
So in other words we are probably going back to billy/huntress/nurse eventually and everyone will stop yelling.
---
Yikes? Its not fun dude, what aren't you getting? Yea he's technically weaker than a lot of other killers, but those killers are FUN to play against and try to beat. 
---
Legion is a nearly brain dead auto hitting killer and there's nothing fun about that for a survivor.
---
Depends on the player. 4 stacks of BBQ and 2 kills is a win to me. 
---
The dev average goal is 2. Tru3 had a perfectly balanced death/escape game there, both sides as optimal as possible and still met the dev goal.
---
That's a win. 
---
Plays doctor: BRAIN BLAST
---
Letting people bleed out is a legit strat to avoid ranking up to fast, at least its better than dc ranking down.
---
How? Instaheals?  Then the instaheal gets a note that it deletes the medkit from being recalled. Im sure there are ways to protect against cheesing item. A white ward is a very rare offering it should do what its supposed to and protect your item. 
---
Yep, only makes sense to use Judith's with the Infinite EW3 add-on. 
---
Last game I did five gens, two totems, three saves, the door, and then I was the only one to die. Big rip. 
---
Green Keys see auras. It’s worthless, don’t use it or any addons for a green key cause anything it can do a perk can do as well or better. 
---
Purple and Red Keys open hatches. If you plan to hatch out, do two gens and play hide and seek. Hatch opening keys don’t need addons to open the hatch, you would want addons that let you keep it if you open it/die. (Weaved Ring/Milky Glass)
---
Maps are still decent. If you bring them in solo play, only bring the really good ones with White Wards to save it. Your escape chances are so much better in solo if you bring a Rainbow Map with Crystal Bead and Retardant Jelly. 
---
It would make them being a team actually meaningful. 
---
Yes it’s not hard to hit them when you are 2 meters behind them but you might as well just use hillbilly or leatherface for the same effect. 
---
Needing to use another very rare addon just to get the most out of it makes it more of a handicap. 
---
Tombstone is a handicap because of the moderately decreased movement speed unless you’re running turf of hairs which again takes away the op factor because 2 ultra rates aren’t that common. 
---
Noed is a crutch but not a strong one as it can be entirely prevented, yes some totems are hard to find depending on the map if you’re playing on the memorial swamp or the game then expect the worst, if your playing on cold wind, Macmillan or any other large open map you have an almost guaranteed chance of all totems being destroyed. 
---
I played 2 matches as a Spirit and I definitely can hear a difference! You can finally hear foodsteps again!
---
so gens are slower now?
---
The best way to use Whispers is not to find where someone is but instead find where they aren’t. Ever since using it it helps the two most time consuming parts of the game, the start and ending. By using whispers who see where someone isn’t, you close in on their spawns and hiding areas. 
---
Shit :/ sometimes I gotta step away from teh game but go in a locker or the basement if you gotta go afk
---
LOL probably and with that back to complaining how all red rank games have the same killers.  Its a vicious cycle, i know 
---
We aren’t. 
---
Not yet, maye later this week (Thursday after dev stream where they showcase the event like they did with the Hallowed Blight one) or later down the line.
---
Ptb changes 
---
Deliverance+Breakdown is a great combo. Deliverance is a really fun perk but I ALWAYS get back to the hook, I'm too stupid to sneak away. So I dropped it.
---
I guess the correct use of Deliverance if you're not good at chases/sneaking is wait till the killer gets in a chase with another survivor to use it. Also the risk of getting unhooked too early is there. Also the risk of being the first hooked or that the survivor you just unhooked runs to the killer, nullifying the safe unhook. Very tricky perk. Never got to made it work properly. But that's because I make mistakes.
---
excited to see (hear) something being done about the sound issues! good work folks
---
surveillance / spies changes also sound pretty neat, obviously not gonna be SSS-tier but i'm interested to try them out now
---
The hex perk would probably promote tunneling, other that this is a good concept 
---
The movement speed reduction is ass
---
But what do the noises sound like? I never hear anything
---
Here’s a link to a recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aio9a5/patch_250_is_live_on_all_platforms/?st=JR7Z727N&amp;sh=ea0294d2) with all the patch notes
---
More stealth Killers would be so nice, maybe something like a ''Predator'', going almost completely invisible but with something more to him to differentiate him from the Wraith.
---
Play with a guy like this, then I get off and remember why I dont like playing with him.
---
He puts in 50 hours a week(full time streamer) 
---
I put in around 5 a week. 
---
I have been playing for about a year and I have, I introduced him to the game about 6 months ago. Every rank reset he ends up about 2 ranks higher than me, and talks about how he is a God, and always tries to tell me about game mechanics I told him about in the first place. Play swf with him, he dies first, always, then says something smart ass to the killer.
---
Gets old man xD 
---
have you seen Nea? or Quentin? Or Freddy?
---
Considering the afk.. and how you played this in general.. I wouldn’t really think any semi vet player would consider this... Decent.
---
When I get hooked and start to mash the struggle button, very rarely does the gague run out. Sometimes I struggle for 5 seconds and die. I see the gauge run out normally for other players, am I doing something wrong? I know the basement hooks can have perks tied to them.
---
Read the patch notes or watch the 38474 videos with simple notes about the patch notes my dude
---
Alright kid. I'll make sure they are safe.
---
Bang.
---
Im not arguing perks with you i said the point of hexes is perks that would be too powerful without it. Which frankly all current hex perks are. Third seal and lullaby are shit but if they wernt hexes theyd be OP. Hex totems exsist for that reason and they cant be too hard to cleanse
---
Identity V is a DBD clone for both mobile and PC, but it's actually really unique and different in terms of content, graphics, and story
---
IIRC the bug was that the camera was higher than the Killer's head, so people were misjudging the height of the Killer they were playing with.
---
Sometimes I noticed that I queued up randomly with people on my friendslist even though we haven't queued in SWF. To prevent giving away information to those friends you shouldn't be able to see the loadout even when playing solo. Even though it would be interesting for you to see it's more fair how it is now and for the greater good.
---
It won't do what you think it will do. SWF will still know your builds before you kill any of them. Blood Warden is still gonna be garbage. NOED will still be gone before the final gen. This will only stop new survivors from learning the game
---

Don’t forget about great skill checks too. This is based a lot around RNG getting skill checks and on player skill of hitting them, but the ~4 second bonus for hitting each one adds up fast!
---
Huntress main, started playing survivor more (Nea); wanted to see if there are any rules on etiquette for survivors? As killer I've tried not to babysit victims I've hooked, and patrol a wider range, but not sure what's discourteous to other survivors when running with them.
---
gotta have my OP huntress lullabye to make survivors have to look at their screen
---
Ah, yeah, I see how that could happen. It's a good thing that Hex Totems get destroyed quickly lol.
---
But thank you :)
---
Neither, we'll all continue to use the same 7 or so meta perks on both sides.
---
How would you avoid the ambush? This ability basically gives a free hit for Legion... what's the counter play? 
---
Does anyone know if the skating after dropping a pallet is fixed?
---
That’s interesting. That must be the case because that’s right where Dwight dc’d
---
Sure hope not; was planning on switching to her once I'm bored with Huntress!
---
I mean him struggling with perkless Nurse tells more about him than anything else.. 
---
That is what I was expecting, because if you notice I had them off the hook before I got grabbed.  Just a weird circumstance.
---
Why is pc getting such a small update and console is having such a big one?
---
It’s not fair for solo survivors like that person said. You’re bringing up something that might be common for you but not the rest of the people who solo queue. 
---
Sketchy af
---
Game crashes on starting screen now (the press space to continue one). Anyone else having this issue?
---
Lullaby would be too strong if it was uncleansable especially if paired with some killer abilities or perks
---
hiding in a corner as claudette and seeing the killers red stain pass right over you is an extreme feeling
---
Damnit
---
Okay thanks. Ehat was the old days gen rushing?
---
The hero we need, but not the one we deserve.
---
I have no intention on making anyone feel some type of way. Just wanted to share this with y’all. Shouldn’t make assumptions based off other people 
---
Why didn't they add a list of all the changes on here? I can't access the forums on the WiFi I'm connected too.
---
I’d highly recommend it
---
As a survivor I have zero fear of any of the current hexs. But I also run swf only so there is that issue
---
spies is ok now, but damn, all those notifications from across the map.  Survivor will be long gone by the time you get there though.  But fun to play with and is far better
---
How can he be the best if others can do it?
---
Marth88 did it each rank grind with each killer individually. Iron Freddy, Iron Huntress, Iron Hag - all before they were buffed and changed.
---
Sure Tru3 is a decent player, but he is now way the best for doing the same as anyone else.
---
I did both in one match after runbing away (and losing him twice) for 5 mins when he hit me I gave up and thats when he let me go ha
---
by that logic survivors should thank you for tunneling them, you're just making their whole game nothing but a chase right? smh
---
That’s listed as fixed in the patch notes. 
---
As a survivor if you don’t get chased/hooked and only do gens, you should be getting at least one pip because that’s iridicent lightbringer and Iridicent evasion. Other than that if the killer gets ran around by one person all game, open chests, cleanse totems and open one or both exit gates if you can. If you can’t get a lot of altruism, it’s best to just go next. 
---
yes, its known as the gayest horror movie ever made
---
No. :)
---
Not if you're tacticool with Play With Your Food stacks
---
There’s nothing you can do really, that’s why a lot of people don’t like the scoring because if the killer stinks, you’re pretty much screwed. If they camp also it will hurt survivor points.
---
I like Ace. His animation screams ‘I don’t give a flying flip’
---
So a 8g update for a bug?
---
On console, you are almost straight out of luck. As a killer, just wait it out. As a survivor, the best thing you can do is to turn your look sensitivity up and try to loop around. You can usually 360 a killer just by turning directions, however, since the Killer FPS on console is more ass than a Kardashian meet-up.
---
I love this new update
---
I want this deleted and burned
---
juggling is situational since you can only do it 4 times which needs a hook to be close. survivors can also block the hook giving you the ds anyway if they juggled. 
---
From my experience they've responded fast and helped me out, not griefing-related but I was compensated 600k BP for the progression of an entire session I had lost within 24h of sending a ticket.
---
I went to change Feng's clothes because it did that bug where it sometimes resets your characters clothes to default, and I was met with Claudette's face cosmetics!
---
basically the vfx from the perk make the game run like a powerpoint
---
It is definitely very strong but I would never say op even at unlimit range because survivors can just play around crows. It is new and survivors have forgotten about these little guys but should quickly learn their spook range or just crouch around them.
---
Ohh gotcha. Thanks mate
---
This is a killer main sub. :( you won’t get many voices of support, sadly. 
---
Read it man, there’s loads of changes, fixes, like some perks have completely changed. 
---
It wasn’t even in the game originally, it got added later cause people kept asking for it and would jump lobbies until they got grouped together. And the game is still balanced around assuming no SWF. 
---
Me too
---
Ah, the classic Whack-A-Dwight 
---
This will make a fine addition to my collection.
---
Meming aside, this is a beautiful meme for a Doc player that has been known to rant about DS for long stretches :p
---
There is a bug in the game that makes some icons of the cosmetics turn into that default claudette with the price of 1000 auric cells. I have no clue what causes that and why but hey, at least we got to meme about Billy using Claudette as a weapon
---
So killers need more perks to tell them where survivors are? Okay. Lol 
---
This is from Tru3’s stream? The mori spam?
---
Map hooks could all be sabotaged and wouldn't respawn (leaving only basement hooks). Trapper was much more feared. He could put traps directly under a hooked survivor. 
---
How about bloodwarden?
---
The 25th. 
---
The only thing I know about the beta is that the surv-running animation looked like they had shat their pants.
---
BBQ is the easiest one to figure out by far, but you're totally right. All the most powerful perks are dead easy to tell if you've played the game enough. I call NOED just about every time just like it said (oh this killer isn't doing very well, GOTTA be NOED) 
---
obsession perks "stack" yeah, they dont cancel each other out, they will always work
---
Idk leatherface seems to not have any sound as his chainsaw is going off, it's very confusing
---
I don't have any friends that play this game anymore though.
---
I hover around rank 5 to 1 typically. I didn't realize rank 8 was that bad now.
---
My friends literally call out NOED within the first two seconds of seein the killer. Along with nurses calling. It really just hinders survivors knowing the meta perks for killer tbh. 
---
omg I love this idea. Of course it might need some numbers tweaking and maybe we need they would need to redo deep wounds again but the raw concept is million times better that the brain dead power Legion has currently. 
---
I have a pretty good pc and average 45-55fps. I know that’s a lot better than console, but given that my pc is like 1.5-2x stronger than any console, I still feel like a game with these types of graphics should easily run 80-100fps on the machine I have. I know it’s hard to have sympathy for pc players when console is so bad, but the bottom line is this game is horrendously optimized for all platforms. Battlefield 1 runs 65-75 FPS on my computer for reference, and that game looks a hell of a lot better than DbD.
---
It is not incredibly easy, though, to see only 3 perks during the course of the game, watch the gens pop, get to the exit gates, and all of a sudden there are a bunch of black pointy spikes blocking the exit gates. Or to tell they have Nurse's calling instead of Stridor (or a good headset). It is incredibly difficult to tell if they're running Bloodhound until it's already too late, and they've found you, no matter how well you were hiding with Urban and Iron Will.
---
Ah, ok. So they won't actually "know", they'll just have to guess and hope they're right. Because some of your examples aren't necessarily indicative of using a perk and could instead be attributed to good game sense.
---
&gt;Do they consistently show up after you complete a gen? Bitter Murmur.
---
&gt;Are they having trouble getting anything done while gens are still up? NOED.
---
These are little more than guesses. They may be educated guesses, but they're guesses nonetheless. 
---
This change will have more of an impact then you give it credit for. SWFs will now have to actually be cautious about perks instead of having one of their buddies immediately spoil everything the moment they die. 
---
Because you can only guess if someone is running Whispers, or Bloodwarden, or NOED,  or Devour Hope, or Nurse's Calling, or any of the dozen of other perks that don't have solid proof in-game. 
---
So they made swf, so you can work with friends, and didn't want you to talk with them?
---
Intresting but don't think so mate
---
Probably bugged - it should be open in that circumstance.
---
It used to be a 1v1 situation bot a 4v1
---
Yeah, people say that he's brain-dead &amp; auto-hit and thaaaat is not the case. It seems a lot like a few people said that and now everyone is just parroting it.
---
It's just frustrating because I'll see in post game chat frequently that the killer that just tunneled me with a mori did it because it just happened to him as a survivor. This community pisses me off, everyones a victim and simultaneously overpowered at all times apparently. Because of this community mentality every single player I encounter if I'm not playing with my group of friends is overly toxic and just there to ruin someone elses game.
---
Tfw when I opened this is the middle of class
---
Tfw when the kid behind me sees
---
"But yo there's no problem bringing in all high level toolboxes as survivor." Survivors be like....
---
Best part is that it's legion
---
Cleanse every dull totem you see and try to get as many saves as you can, work on gens when you have nothing else to do.
---
interesting stuff! though since i'm a freak for the AVP games i have to wonder how the xeno lifecycle would work in this game, a bit like myers i guess?
---
start as a facehugger, mori a survivor to advance to a chestburster. chestburster has to find and eat cats that spawn throughout the level (???) to become a full-fledged xeno
---
i think you have to have facehuggers in some way since they're really what the alien series is all about. if we're in pure fantasy land - eggs that are randomly spread throughout the map that the alien can "trigger remotely" to spawn a facehugger - first time, the survivor manages to pull it off without a loss in speed. second time, they have to stop for a bit to pull it away. third time, they get egged up and now have to go find a magic pill bottle or something. doctor + hag + pig. yes i know this would be miserable to play against. hey, it's a xeno, no-one has fun in the alien films
---
Can someone drop a link to the new released patch notes, some reason I can’t find them
---
I never realized how much I missed sounds until a couple days ago, every sound the Doctor made was just gone, except for the hit sound and his heavy breathing (not the demon breathing). No zaps, no shocks, no laughter. It was so surreal...felt so good to hear that giggle the next game.
---
Where does the darn thing come from? (never saw the movies, probably there?)
---
Surprised pikachu. 
---
He's not saying it is be uncleansable. He's saying it shouldn't be as easy as "I found the colored totem, kiss 1/4 of your perks goodbye" 
---
I main surv and I see soooooo many DC's with legion. He's not that hard to win against Imo. 
---
I have come to the conclusion that the entire map of the game is a counter, since it’s hard for him to bounce off survivors when they’re on different floors
---
I first encountered it on the boat vaults on pale rose. It got fixed in the patch though which is good.
---
oh god, the r2 l2 character switch on the ps4 just fucked me lmao made me use feng min with 0 perks smh this is gonna be tough 
---
Might have no played surv in a few seasons
---
^(there's also an exploit you can do which allows you to do a second rank reset per month)
---
I wonder how much toxic survivor behavior is encouraged or undisturbed because of peer pressure...
---
Cool beans. I've been wanting to do that to asshole teammates as Dwight (they always underestimate me), but I don't wanna find out...the hard way.
---
It’s really not 
---
I think you only see the nerfs. Survivors have been buffed as well with the reduced vault time and momentum change. BT got fixed as well which is huge.
---
Didn't Marth do this on multiple killers before they removed pallet-vacuum?
---
No need. Blood Warden is a garbage tier perk because of how specific the requirements are. If someone is being carried while the gates are powered but not opened, we've always 99% until they're hooked because the perk is trash. One click and the gate is open and we're free to walk out.
---
The perk needs to be changed to activate whenever a killer gets a hook if the gates are powered and the timer starts when the gates get opened. Until then, it'll stay useless
---
&gt;And the game is still balanced around assuming no SWF. 
---
Literally one of the most significant changes this patch was a SWF nerf what are you talking about? 
---
Exactly. 
---
It’s hard to transcend your personal misfortune, though. But if you’re the first one hooked, it’s your job to keep the Killer there so everyone else can put down the generators. But it’s hard to fight the temptation to rage quit if you’re the one who dies.
---
Even if he ends up “tunneling” you, you have kept his attention long enough for your teammates (hopefully) to make an escape.
---
You don't give survivor players enough credit.
---
Nurses is a dead giveaway, Devour is a totem, if you find a lit totem and there isn't Ruin, you have a 66% of good things happening to you if you pop it. I like those odds. Blood Warden is a garbage perk because the conditions are too specific for the perk to activate consistently (needs to be buffed so that the perk activates whenever the gates are powered instead of only open and the timer starts when the gate opens); my group always 99% a gate when a survivor is being carried and clicks it open as soon as the hook is done. Showing up after you Urban Immersion away after 2 gens is more than good game sense.
---
Killers are not good enough/SWF are not bad enough to *not* read these things. Play a few games as SWF and you'll see what I mean. It's not exactly something that is difficult to do
---
You're alone here man... I dont think that many of us Slam Dunk our controllers down
---
welcome to toxic by daylight
---
exactly. 
---
The item currently vanishes if whiteward takes it back so this wouldnt work
---
Congrats to you for having teammates that actually did something one game. 
---
Yea, it is from it indeed [https://clips.twitch.tv/SpineyPatientFiddleheadsWTRuck](https://clips.twitch.tv/SpineyPatientFiddleheadsWTRuck)
---
It is true stealth always works but he is weaker than most against it, is what i meant. And when I talk about me escaping line of sight I mean at rank 1, where I play.
---
Out of curiosity what would you rather see posted on the sub?
---
You must be new to the sub. Any pro survivor stance gets downvoted or mocked until someone makes a pro killer stance. So it really. 
---
I literally linked them in my post but here are they again: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/42972/patch-notes-2-5-0-mid-chapter#latest
---
Hahahahh  :D  Yea!
---
No. If you don’t have Spirit, buy her.
---
as soon as they do this, i want the DS skill check to be cut in half. 
---
:(
---
Then people would always clean all of them. 
---
I mean.. that's a terrible build, though.
---
I think the devs even mentioned it in their dev stream so.
---
I have all the others.
---
Darn
---
I understand gulags and the holocaust... but to DC with 4 party streamers...
---
Buy a survivor or use in Shrine for extra BP’s. 
---
the fact we now have a outfit option on the character customization just gives me hopes for bunny feng
---
Please stop saying BT got fixed. It really didn’t. This is the second match since the update where it blatantly hasn’t gone off. It has not been fixed. 
---
I'd be fine if they just showed all players who has it, rather than JUST the obsession. It always sucks ass to get stabbed in the neck without any indicator. Also, DS getting hit would still do just as much harm. No actual change to impact its functionality
---
You fail to understand true counter play against an ability, so there is no point of further discussion. Just know that the majority of people feel this is the exact issue. Trying to understand it instead of argue against it with inaccurate observations would go a long way in understanding the root of people's issues with legion. To be frank, I'd rather face an ebony mori nurse with 5000 hour in game than face legion...not because legion is powerful,  but because there is absolutely 0 fun in playing against him/her. I'm a rank 1 killer and survivor myself, so take it as you will. 
---
I saved teammates they opened gate left me on the hook to die... If you wonder why Nea has that mad face that's probably why.lol
---
Anyone know what happened to the self care buff that was coming?
---
I outright shit my pants one match. Tried to hold it but it decisive striked
---
This post has made me inhale and exhale five times then chuckle a bit while trying to figure out a reply to this 
---
Bravo op this is the only post that made me genuinely chuckle in quite a while
---
I mean, then all this wraps back around to your group operating like a Seal Team 6. So if this change doesn't affect your uber-1337 MLG gaming pro death squad, then I guess you get a gold star and a cookie. Congratulations on you and your friends being omniscient and never being wrong.
---
The fact that I've seen a ton of grousing and complaining about the change disguised under a veil of "BUT THINK OF THE NEW PLAYERS" tells me that it's going to hamper SWF in a non-insignificant manner.
---
oh shit that might explain it tbh. I was explaining in another comment that a pigtrap killed someone on the hatch before and it didn't spawn in.  
---
I wonder if it matters whether or not they leave the game, or just die on it. Cause like Dwight could have DC'd, but stayed to watch. (not common, but it happens) and I know the person who died form the pig stayed to watch.
---
It's fun yeah but it has its serious downfalls. You cant hide from jason even though theres hiding places they're 100% useless which is something I really like about DBD. Also Jason is clunky as hell hes so hard to play as sometimes
---
Because legion can counter everything survivors depend on to escape.
---
Seems like you're another guy who hates legion ;D
---
Because legion is extremely annoying to play against 
---
I like Noed for the scare factor. So even if the booboo killers struggle there’s at least some added “oh shit” moment at the end. Dstrike is just an all around annoyance and doesn’t play into the scare factor at all. Like I get it’s not balanced well but at least it’s trying to make the game scary like it should be
---
I should say I totally agree there is no counter to his actual power. Well, pallet stuns and sprint bursts aside. You can break line of sight but it's not a guarantee of getting away. He will eventually catch you. And general tactics that stop other killers don't work on him. But that's kind of the point. Take for example Hag. The point of hag is that she punishes running around, saving quickly, and in general not being careful. You can't 'counter' that. If you run near hag, you hit traps. End of story. You probably don't have a flashlight because people often don't even bring in hag if you have flashlights. So let's talk about legion then. The 'point' of legion is that HE IS FAST. He HITS you. To put in a direct counter to that would be like giving a disarm to hag traps without flashlights. Would hag still be playable? Yeah. But it would be a massive change. In any case, how WOULD you change legion, if you could, and still have him be legion? Because you can't just delete a killer, people payed money, etc.
---
Yeah but I mean disconnecting just because you’re mad at a video game is not cool
---
So we should play with friends but never talk to them, based on your idea. That destroys the idea of playing with friends. It’s the exact same as, say, playing Rainbow Six or COD with friends, it’s an advantage, but not one that is unbeatable. Besides, most groups of friends who play are very casual, myself included. Usually all I hear in my ears is “is Kate thick with 3 C’s or 4?” and “dude let me unhook you so I can farm BP.” Half the time I want to mute them lol
---
Well a game should be balanced around the good players and not potatoes. If your team is full of potatoes you probably shouldnt win unless the Killer was equally potato.
---
It not even in the patch notes, if that’s the reason why wouldn’t they mention it. Oh well
---
Weren’t they super weak at the beginning but then they buffed them too hard?
---
I'd like NOED to be nerfed into the ground.
---
-No longer a hex perk
---
-No longer gives exposed effect
---
-Inceass speed by 5%/6%/7%
---
More likely urban which is soo soooo boring .... I can't stand survivots who use it all the time. And the devs just want to make even more people to use it ...
---
Too fat
---
Lullaby is the weakest hex imo. You need at least 3-4 hooks before it's even remotely useful and by that time the survivors have already found it because the game alerts them of it's presence as soon as starting a gen for some reason.
---
So can the nurse, get over it
---
Sometimes I get 4k's just because they wont leave it alone.
---
Nice meme
---
oh really? wow i figured you designed the whole thing. It kind of reminded me of trapper with feathers ngl lmao Great concept though
---
They have beeb buffing killers and nerfing survivors with each update in one way or the other but now they are suddenly "circlejerking" survivors because they reduced the time by 0.1 seconds. 
---
well the point of the traps isn't to catch you, though. The point is to force you to move slow. The point of legion is to catch you. That's the purpose of it. That's my argument, is that people want legion to be a totally different killer because they want to take the one thing he's meant to do and change it to something different. Another great example is pig. The point of pig isn't to kill you with traps. It's to force you to not focus on gens completely. Granted, the punishment is there, but that's to force the point of the ability. In fact when pig came out the devs talked about how they were trying to work on interesting ways to get rid of gen rush.
---
Adrenaline + Exhaustion perk is meta, you'll be fine.
---
Happens more often than I’d like to admit. Survivors need better sense of teammateship imo
---
That hook muttered gg ez
---
Get out. Just, get out.
---
Like the Iron Maiden nerf, too many people were running it I guess.
---
Oh boy if I could get one bloodpoint for everytime someone said this game will die soon because off...........the devs did. I would have 1000000 bloodpoits because of that damn cap.
---
Better than on console, I suppose
---
Yeah that's where they got things right for sure. Just other ways to escape but killing jason is so convoluted I have played over 500 matches and literally only have ever seen it happen once. But that's what's cool about it is being able to communicate with your team. I believe DBD should have it in close range. F13 has that and walkie talkies which is really smart
---
More gameplay videos or discussion
---
Rancor is so scummy, and at first I was against using it because I used to play mainly survivor. But then survivors have hardened my heart with all of their tea-bagging and DS, and so I use it every match, unless I really liked the survivor.
---
It rewards you for surviving with basically only 3 perks all game by healing you and giving haste to close out the game. If looping well isn't skill then IDK what you think displays survivor game knowledge.
---
Yes its shit but if you couldnt cleanse it it would be too strong
---
This is a dumb post, noed isn't op just leave the match lmao damn survivor mains complain about everything, lmao Nerf adrenaline and DS
---
I wish survivors would learn 👏stop👏unhooking👏in front👏of👏the killer
---
Hex perks are still going to be cleansed, just that the totem is not lit.
---
SWF players will have to make educated guesses about the killer's loadout, and that's much better being able to share the knowledge with each other with 100% certainty. The benefit there for the killer is obvious. If the only downside to trying to equalize the Discord/Partychat boosts is that curious randos will need to spectate until the match is finished, that's not so bad. A minor QOL inconvenience. 
---
Then what happens with franklins?
---
I'm sorry, what event are we summoning?
---
I've found the the spacebar on my keyboard is just finicky so it won't register my hits sometimes. I've since remapped it to "f" and it's so much easier!!
---
Ok thanks.
---
So the exact opposite of the current free swing thing? Alright, I could see that. But what about the issue of people jumping over pallets after he goes? It's extremely hard to hit them and makes his power work against him. And he's already so weak that this is a massive nerf in power. Because I don't think you're arguing he is strong but rather he's not fun for you to play against. And if you just do a nerf to make him fun for survivors you make an already weak killer almost unplayable.
---
None I was off a week 
---
I mean I don‘t know a good Nurse which uses Ruin so that stays the same. 
---
Sure Shadowborn is nice for the FOV but still doable without.
---
BBQ and Nurses and Whispers help a lot but game knowledge, good Eyes and Sounds do as well.
---
A good Nurse often 4k‘s with 3, 4 or even 5 gens left with perks, it isn‘t that hard to pip or even 4k without any perks. 
---
If you‘re a good nurse that is :)
---
I'm not seeing the problem here. 
---
damn that's pretty coal dude
---
I play as the doctor mainly but all of my friends want to play as survivor. I hate playing as survivor most of the time because if the killer sees me I am dead. I don’t know how to escape well enough. I pray that I can just turn a corner and lose them but that only happens if they are really new or something similar. Any tips on the perks to use to lose a killer fast? 
---
Id prefer a totem counter next to the number of gens. At least it would brimg solo survivor up to swf when dealing with NOED
---
I mean I dont even play survivor. He asked a question, so therefore, I answered. Get over it.
---
I didn't know that, nice! And yea, I've been thinking about other mobility perks, but ever since I only started saving SB when I suspect I might need it soon, I've found that it actually increases my travel speed overall. 
---
Sadly? It's hilarious 
---
Okay you hit your head buddy?You do not seem right in the head.
---
I don't know, but she is a pretty toxic girl. Telling people to kill themselves, and just can't be nice.
---
RIGHT? Especially since it's like... Dude, I spent $8 on this, and I spent cells on a skin for it, I'm gONNA PLAY IT, and your complaining isn't going to change that.
---
&amp; another thing is that all killers are unpleasant to play against for one reason or another. Like, I hate playing against Leatherface and the Hillbilly, because I legitimately hate one-downs. They're why I switched to killer to begin with, because one downs stress me out so much, but I'm not going to tell people who play those killers that they're skill-less killers.
---
You clearly don't have a solid understanding of the game as a whole. I would strongly suggest spending a good amount of time as survivor and killer. First of all "insta blind" flashlights are long gone, a blind is only guaranteed during an animation. BNP is not even kind of an issue anymore. You metion keys are "skipping a game mechanic" well how do you feel about moris? What about exhaustion addons completely negating every exhaustion perk besides sprint burst? It seems you have problems with survivor items and addons, I can assure you most 4 man SWF suvivor item combos cannot compare to some killer combos (ebi mori+some OP addons.) I see you have legion flair, I'm sure you would know a thing or two about breaking the game.
---
Hes obviously a killer main :-/
---
The same thing god 
---
Also keep in mind a hooked survivor will trigger whispers, learned that one the hard way...
---
This I agree with mostly, but there is still risk involved in the built in counter to her ability. Dont get me wrong though, survivors are still more powerful than most killers (nurse, Billy and spirit not included) because of how quick gens can be done. Honestly, fixing the gens or adding objectives would go a long way into making the game more balanced, interesting and fun. But a rank 1 nurse would then just wreck everybody.  Balance in this game is so difficult because of the very asymmetrical design and different inherit powers of the killers. I don't envy the devs in any way. How do you fix a killer that decides to facecamp each hook? The only answer to that is gen rush and hope you dont get hooked next. What surprises me is even in the red ranks,  every once and a while I'll get facecamped. You never used to see this at those ranks. 
---
I love the idea of a decoy, and the idea of the killer is cool, just the disguise idea never works out. Great work overall!
---
Maining the legion is miserable. I'm not the idiot who thinks Legion is healthy for the game. I'm the idiot or enjoys playing them and bought every outfit. I have a DC every game and the entire community hates me for liking the killers lore and gameplay.
---
I used to main nurse so its an even bigger yikes.
---
Legion has no counterplay and no build diversity. He's fun to play as for a while, but once his delay build is boring, he's boring af.
---
Oh please. Nothing beats the favouritism SWF has gotten. To this day the game is still not balanced with voice chat in mind. 
---
Not to mention high rank players abusing SWF matchmaking to troll low rank killers. 
---
How do chainsaws work in what's the difference between Billy and bubba?
---
My main questions about this are.
---
Why when you hit an object with bubba sometimes his chainsaw stops and sometimes it doesn't? If you let go of the the chainsaw while in full Sprint as Billy can you still hit someone with it if there are close enough?
---
Tinkerer doesn't show auras. It only gets rid of the Terror Radius. Which you'll know if they have because they appear without a Terror Radius. I'm not talking about when you're on the gen and the killer shows up, or even when you finish a gen and then sprint away like a moron and get found. I'm talking about when you finish a gen and either Urban Immersion away or walk away, leaving no traces of your path, and the killer still finds you immediately.
---
Rancor requires an obsession, which is a bit of a giveaway in and of itself.
---
Brutal Strength is easy to read because 20% is a quite sizable increase. Spirit Fury could be used on top of Brutal, but again, also easy to read, the killer will herd you towards pallets instead of away from them.
---
You only call Nurses if they immediately start getting closer when you're healing... It's like you guys can't understand that SWF can actually use their brains and don't just mindlessly run around calling out random perks....
---
Unless you're like me, then you get a download 3x bigger than the original patch that will take another 2 hours.
---
This is me nearly every game. 
---
Unless all 4 survivors run it and land it and you don't have enduring, noed is a much more powerful perk
---
What did they do to survivor movement? It feels awkward and you literally can’t 360 anymore at all, awful unneeded change. Some vaults are fucked up too
---
On the campfire on the first screen. 
---
I think they mean their work network block any site related to gaming so can not access your link.
---
Child artists always make children so ugly..
---
They said they didn’t like how it felt and may see it return as a new perk later on but overall the way people were using it encouraged less teamwork to heal one another. 
---
ewwwww console...
---
1rs.-  it was post as a shitpost 
---
2nd.-  Again... the consequence is that an afk player can make the others player lose a game, EVEN if he don't go afk on purpose
---
3rd.-  even if it don't like the post, you don't need to be a mmgvo 
---
I still say simply give killers ability to shut hatch, allow survivors to open it with a like 15 second channel or a gen pop
---
Ouch. I assume this is a PC issue? I play on console (God help me) and have never ran into that issue.
---
I love the idea of a disguising Killer - and not kinda/sorta like Pig does, but full on bamboozle! However, I think that your proposed powers are too strong: for one, the Decoy shouldn't be able to both chase Survivors and patrol gens - I think it should be one or the other.   
---
My proposed change is this: make it go in a straight line, but instantly go after any newest noise event. This would make it so when Survivors are spooked by it and start fast-vaulting, it will attempt to follow them; but also, it'd allow for some counterplay.
---
However, this requires the devs to put in actual path-finding AI, which might be a hurdle for making this sort of Killer. 
---
Onto the Disguise then: seems pretty balanced to me. Can't use it straight away, can't camp with it - and the fact that it can only copy a recently injured survivor adds a layer of mindgames. Did that Cultist copy the injured guy, or is he saving it? Am I healing the Cultist right now? Which one of these Davids is real? Dude, that sounds so fun! 
---
Can't say much about perks since I'm not good at this game, but Greed sounds suspiciously like Devour Hope, and Punishment is like a better Bamboozle. But Favourite seems more than fine. 
---
Overall I really like this, and I hope the devs can someday allow such serious shenanigans!
---
I do watch
---
Yeah for the most part he is trash. He has a lot of issues that are hard to look past especially when you get into a lower rank. 
---
* [Self care](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Self-Care)
---
* Can't stop a person from going free if you had to hook them near a exit.
---
* Hatch standoffs don't work if the other person has self care or a medkit.
---
* His fog limits his seeing distance by a lot, if survivors use a fog offering it can make things really difficult.
---
He has some pros too:
---
* He's really good at slugging people (Slugging means leaving them in the downed state.)
---
* Survivors don't know he's coming unless they're using [premonition](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Premonition) or [spine chill](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spine_Chill)
---
* He can't be body blocked and flashlight saves are very hard if they're not also in the dream world.
---
Freddy was the first killer I played too and prestiged, he's really fun! He's almost not very powerful though ): There is other killers like Billy and Nurse which are far more powerful as you rank up higher and get more skilled players you'll unfortunately find that out ):
---
Billy can run fast but hit only one survivor and can't change direction easily while Bubba is just slightly faster, can move freely and kill more survivors at time. When Billy hit an object he stops immediately while Bubba has a tantrum that hit anyone nearby.

---
new player here: i think the ranking system is not good. it is way too easy to rank up. i don't belong where i am (top 8) and just get shit on every time i play but pretty much always have enough points to not lose pips.
---
neither am i supporting or trying to justify DCing but that being said i absolutely understand when people DC in order to derank.
---
Nice find!
---
The reason hes saying it is probably because nurse is a lot of muscle memory iirc and using addons that affect her blinks and cooldowns make you have to rely on them
---
Btw, Doctor's madness bar is gone now, only shows tier 1-3. So accidentally doc buff
---
idk if ur memeing or not but thats funny
---
Fair enough, I've never been hit with that one yet
---
I was running against him the past few days, was playing non stop and I was wondering/cause I havent played for a while/ what do you do when he hits you once with his ability and then get exhausted. So you drop the chase, run, hide behinde the corner and start mending cause the time it almost gone. But then I hear him again that hes after me - after all the scratchmarks last for very long. So if I start runnig Ill drop dead cause my timer is gone but if I stay mending he will jut come to me and hit me and I can't start the chase again cause I am behinde the corner. Do I have to mend infront of him ? I just don't understand what to do here - that  is why I find really lame atm as a killer
---
#TooReal
---
I’m sorry for your loss :( Mine only last about 4 games before some shit like this occurs
---
Exhaustion doesnt go down while sprinting
---
Vault goes down from 1 second to .9
---
"Wow the devs are so survivor saided"
---
I mean I just watched tru put a video up this morning of all five gens getting done in 4 minutes 8 seconds and I reckon he’s a good nurse. He was perkless, and while he walked away with 2 kills it was more them screwing up their end game saves. 
---
Me? I suck with nurse. Absolute garbage. 
---
Naomi Tapp, you have staked out your competition and your performance showed true tenacity.  Shantay you stay. 
---
Gia YamaHoe, your performance was haunting. You showed your true spirit fury tonight.  And remember you are and forever will be an all-star. _one more thing, shantay you also stay_.
---
gg ez!? That's too toxic for BHVR, no wonder they nerfed hook emotions
---
Wow man you weren't kidding. Now everytime I don't kill all 4 survivors they call me shit. Even if I do kill them all they call me shit for try harding and not letting them get bp.
---
I'd take that too, although I'd take a counter on small game at the very least, just to make the perk usable
---
It is definitely the full price for me.
---
Which would be awesome but I feel like that should be a mori. Otherwise it might be too OP hahaha.
---
Blame on the killer
---
When you heard its bitter murmur, you should've iron grasped your cheeks!
---
It's not that people don't think SWFs have brain. You just oversimplify. 
---
Obsession means killer runs rancor? Or maybe..just maybe it's Play with your Food or Remember Me or another killer perk which shows up every now and then? Or maybe Decisive Strike?
---
Hex that isn't ruin must be Devour Hope? Last 45 doctors I met had zero Devour Hopes and 11 Haunted Grounds. 74 huntresses with zero Devour Hopes, but 18 other hexes. And so on...
---
Yeah you can call out a lot of perks, but someone breaking a pallet 0,5 seconds faster isn't really something everyone, even the top players, notice 100% of the time.
---
And people can’t lie on polls? Do they check their steam accounts or twitch pages? Lol 
---
Steam Achievement Manager: a program that forces achievements to pop for your account...when i was a young lad i used it for a few achievements that drove me crazy in payday 2...mainly that one fucking bomb heist one. But yeah he thought you cheated your achievements
---
Literally unplayable
---
Thank you so much :)
---
I do like the mind game aspect of a Killer disguising themselves, but the only problem with it is that it can be easily countered with SWF. 
---
And I do agree with the Decoy moving to the newest noise event, I'm still thinking of ways to make both abilities fair and balanced
---
And yeah, I did base those two perks around Devour Hope and Bamboozle, but just added a little twist to them :/
---
I just like the concept of a Survivor just turning sides and willingly joining the Entity  
---
they arent DCing because they are mad, they just dont want to waste their time
---
I actually like the idea of your solution.  But play testing to verify it of course. I actually like legion's concept and they did awesome with the lore. But it shouldn't be a chore to play a game. Playing as legion and against him feels like a chore. Feelsbadman.
---
Or, like I also said, research the info yourself. If you can play DBD, you will most likely have access to the Internet. If you play on Steam, there are guides available at all times with just a couple button presses. If someone wants to learn why they lost, there are a plethora of methods to find out. Meanwhile, you complain that players HAVE to wait those 6 minutes. They can leave and do all that, but the main purpose isn't to bully new players, it's to make SWF less powerful. This game has SWF to encourage playing with friends, but this breaks a lot of the challenge in the game for survivors. It promotes bad behavior. If you think a killer might have NOED, then you'll cleanse all the totems. If you get told when they do or don't, you won't get into that habit. If you know the killer has Nurse's, rather than not healing when they're around based on knowledge, or based on their terror radius, you can just be told. Then, when you play alone and are starved of such information, you are handicapped by not playing the same. If players don't pick up habits, in or out of SWF, they'll never even escape the brown ranks. 
---
Well in a sense I guess it's just a meme but if noed were to be nerfed hard then I want some survivor perks nerfed 
---
Oink
---
It is a silly personal thing. I don't like to be ds'ed or flashlighted as the killer so I don't use them against other killers and when I find one in a chest I'd go "eww" and drop it.
---
And that is the big difference, you need brains to use Nurse effective. Legion is like auto pilot
---
As long as you agree mama huntress is best girl then we aight
---
No you want it at level three because it gives a shorter range to detect. If Whispers is large you can still be misguided. Always level perks to lv 3. I can’t think of a perk thhats better at a lower rank. 
---
I use discordance but none of the other perks 
---
Thank you!!
---
I believe so, but i can't find them in the icons inside dbd. What is there is the golden coins but from the last Lunar Year Event. 
---
I know, I'm saying it's not easy to pip when the games are 4-5 minutes like a lot of hit were recently. You're guarenteed no emblem in gatekeeper when the games are that fast. Most likely you wont have any kills or maybe 1, so max bronze in devout. Then you hardly had any time to chase and hit people so you're definitely not getting iridescent in chaser or malicious. 
---
I think this change is primarily a "fix" for adrenaline because if you were exhausted and get adrenaline you get an additional exhaustion so the status effect can bug out and doesn't tick down visually. This should have fixed it if im right.
---
There is already a dbd discord though 
---
AKA the most magical time of the year to try out meme-builds as a killer.
---
Have you tried making one? They are a blast to come up with ideas for! No one really expects them to get into the game, but they are fun to think about. 
---
Please no, it's the only thing that makes scratches mirror Myers somewhat viable.
---
Yes, OoO does work with Sole Survivor and will fully conceal you if you are the last person alive.
---
According to the wiki, you will lose one token each time you use OoO to look at the killer, even if the killer is not reading your aura. But there is a cooldown of 6 secs between each token.
---
He really showed no mercy?
---
This does not look like what I'm actually experiencing, I've recorded from my [own experience](https://youtu.be/CHFaN4KqfMM) what this is like; I'm teleporting back to the basement, and most of the time I can't execute actions like vault/reparing/drop pallets/etc.
---
They tbagged and tbagged pointing n shit, this was my first time playing freddy also
---
..yes they did? You replied to SyxxGod who said "My team popped 3 gens in the time it took a LF to hit someone who was  looping him. We are the power role so yeah nerfs are needed "
---
You're trying to argue that the scenario only occurs with great survivors and not the majority who are supposedly idiots, I gave you the common scenario that occurs for most survivors. 
---
The hatch would not even spawn though if 2 alive and 3 gens are left to do 
---
So you're saying an entire perks should be nullified because of an offering?
---
The fact that you said "buff" makes me even more happy they scraped it. It was def an overall nerf that people were going to see as a buff and be even dumber with there self caring when someone is 2 feet away that could heal them.
---
I was seriously thinking about what this actually means..?
---
360 feel the same for me. Maybe you accidentally uncapped your fps? You can do 360's way better if you cap them at 50 FPS.
---
And regarding vaults: They changed some animations but I agree, they sometimes don't look smooth at all.
---
The hatch would not have spawned though. If there 3 more gens to do with 2 alive. There would have to be 2 more gens left for the hatch to appear. 
---
Wait, we’re there 2 killers? 
---
don't know what to tell ya, champ. Maybe don't play a competitive multiplayer game then. If you give me a 3 gen strat and I down you. I'm going to hook you in a spot where I can protect my gens and stop your team from getting a easy save and reset or if there's a couple of you left I'm going to go toss you on a hook in an area gens are already complete so your teammates have to choose to either come save you or do Gens but not both. I'm going to attempt to slow the game down to give me more time to win. I expect the same from killers when I'm a survivor. If that isn't fun for you, maybe this game isn't for you or perhaps you'd enjoy a co-op game more. 
---
contrary to what you and survivor only players think, just because you got downed and hook. you're not entitled to a free unhook and chance to reset and try again. 
---
Finally. 
---
I'm saying it could've been a bug with the display of the end-game screen maybe, not showing any addons at all. If he truly had none, then it was a bug on your end. 
---
No, he changed me into freddy without perks and add ons. 
---
I rushed to get him to prestige 3 as I usually do for the post chapter bloodhunt. Bought the cool red haur susie skin then realised I hate everything about him. 
---
I  am silly
---
Same. Literally just played a match like that, I just needed a daily with legion so I deep wounded 3 people within the first few seconds, picked one up, and 2 DC'd. I let the other 2 finish all 5 gens, get some pallet stuns, heal. They let me hook em twice, and then I let them escape. Ended up with a pip, my daily, and a ton of BP! 
---
I’ve seen some people use the meg perk “quick and quiet”. It can work a few times if the killer is reliant on sound during a chase. But in all honesty, stealth as a defense isn’t too reliable with the variety of killer tracking perks these days (whispers, nurse’s calling, BBQ, etc.)  Its better to learn how to take full advantage of loops and delay getting hooked by the killer as much as you can. 
---
If nurse wants you down and has played nurse enough to know what to do, you're going down, buddy. :P And I see tons of different legion builds, personally. Maybe I'm just lucky.
---
That wasn’t the point of the conversation though. You missed the first comment and jumped into the conversation in the middle, trying to act like that was the whole point. It wasn’t. So don’t reply to me with your bullshit ‘cause that wasn’t the point of the conversation. Lol so embarrassed for you right now. Once again, if you don’t know what the conversation is about then don’t interject. You come off looking nosey and a fool. 
---
No one was arguing about fucking generators. No where in my original comment were generators mentioned. He replied to me about generators and then you took it upon yourself to assume that was the topic of conversation. Go away, omfg lol
---
I just stood there looking at him, trying to signal that I come in peace. He charged up to t3 and killed me.
---
And you think players queuing up together shouldn't communicate?
---
I highly recommend running that build at some point! 
---
Love this 
---
each user gets the debuff. because if a third person begins operating too, it's -30% total work speed against what would normally take 26 seconds.
---
I think you should be able to fart IN GAME next to people on the hook, or as like a way to distract survivors from close-mid range away from you on the map
---
Where in the patch notes does it say that resilience doesn’t affect vaults anymore?
---
It is not about the nerf it is about the way he works it is just lame AF. Read it again. I don't think he is strong or weak - it just his ability hneeds to be changed in a way that makes sense for both sides 
---
And blood warden. 
---
Ehhh but as a survivor I hate noed and hex ruin why would I run them against someone else 
---
They actually didn't buff him much at all. He's still very weak. People don't like constantly mending and in general not winning chases. But that doesn't make legion strong, just annoying to people. But honestly don't worry about what survivors are angry about, play what makes you happy, because no matter what you do some people are still mad.
---
If you dont have another hex active (Ruin, Lullaby, Devour Hope), people can generally deduce that it's Haunted Grounds.
---
My HG rarely gets broken, or if it does, I can't find anyone before it runs out.
---
Luckily, last night, someone broke it in the first 30 seconds of the match right as I stumbled onto the first gen with 3 survivors on it. Got 3 hooks in under a minute, and they all suicided on the hook.
---
I guess yea
---
Why did they all gather around an AFK player with crows around them, when there was a bunch of other gens they could have been working on? What rank was this game?
---
People like this deserved to be moried
---
I do too but I like winning more than being bested by someone else and if noed isn’t your thing swap in tinker or nursing calling. 
---
Ah I see. I was reading it and wondereing how I could get two of the same statuses of differing strengths that were also timed.
---
Might I suggest depending on something else then?
---
I’m a survivor main and I’m cool with any killer as long as they play fair 
---
I dunno I'd rate 3rd seal lower tbh
---
I have nurses 
---
I once ended up in a match alone with a Pig. I managed to do both gens while the Pig was looking all around the map (lampkin lane) for me. I sometimes would just abandon my gen to tap a gen across the map to throw the killer off and I waited until they checked the exit gat3 I was at before opening is. I eventually made it out, but it definitely took a while before the match was over. I don't know whether the killer would've let me go if she'd found me before I was able to run into the exit gate, but it seemed like she was acrively searching for me and checking lockers.
---
All these OP survivor buffs smh my head 
---
Yes, but there is no killer item that gives 2 kills when 2 gens have been completed
---
But the nurse takes skill. Legion is brain dead. 
---
Why would adding voice chat change anything? I'd immediately mute that and so would most of the playerbase. And those are cherrypicked stats. 
---
Okay you're a troll good to know will remember in future 
---
Some survivors believe they get to say what the rules are. For example you will see names like 'NOED = Disconnect' from survivors that think they get to choose how you play. Ignore them.
---
Thought it was a matchmaking meme, then I saw the splinter 
---
Have you played him yourself?
---
It’s helpful on legion. Idk I don’t mind running toxic builds because other people do it all the time. So if it’s getting done to me I’ll do it back. I personally feel that this community along with R6 and Dayz are some of the most toxic and cancerous. 
---
I mean if someone has noed I won’t DC but I’ll be a hell of a lot more panicked
---
&gt;Id prefer a totem counter next to the number of gens. At least it would brimg solo survivor up to swf when dealing with NOED
---
I'd prefer a totem counter added to Small Game, it would make more sense just like TOTH. 
---
There's been several. Try the search function. When we argue wether the subREDDIT is killer or survivor biased, I figured it might be useful to bring up some RANDOM REDDIT POLLS, but if you prefer talking out of your ass, keep doing that.
---
I mean, most of the scratcher mirror myers I've played can't apply a lot of pressure, so the game goes one of two ways. Snowball for survivor or snowball for mikey boy because he gets fast and early downs. Noed only applies in the final stretch of the game, so at the point where you're playing purely for lategame, you could just as easily play pig with noed and her ultra rare offering
---
Yeah I play him a lot, due to awesome looks. I guess that implies I’m brain dead and I’m fine with that. 
---
*JUsT DoN't GEt lOoPeD* -survivor maiins
---
Seriously though; [this](https://youtu.be/CHFaN4KqfMM) isn't like that at all, I can't open basement chests because of this.
---
Pc
---
I’m trying to fix that by not being toxic 
---
Survivors don’t like legion because they say it’s not fun to play against, yet they have no issue making the game un fun for killers, double standards, 
---
If you accuse me of gatekeeping, I accuse you of strawmanning, because I didn't say "they don't deserve to play", it's if they want to get better. Also, there is a super helpful thing that everyone can access IN-GAME, called the character info. You don't even have to own the character. You can see all the Doctor's perks, read what they do, and learn the effects. You don't need the drive for the search bar, or the toxic hazmat suit for Reddit. You can find it in the game itself. Also, I don't hate SWF. It's a part of the game. But it is easily game-able, and not fair for the killer. A killer with all the best perks and add-ons can get destroyed by SWF no matter how well they do, because they'll get genrushed, bullied, or flat-out denied any victory they could've gotten. God forbid they aren't using reds or purples for add-ons. It removes part of the challenge survivors have, that's information. A survivor wants to know the killer is chasing someone? They put on Empathy, Bond, or Aftercare. It's part of the strategic balance. You have to give and take. If a killer runs a typical perk build (BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Nurse's), they have those perks, but they trade off other perks they could use. If you want to replace Nurse's with something else, it's not like killers can just voice chat their buds on Discord as to where a survivor is healing if they slap on Sloppy. SWF itself isn't bad, the abuse of it is.
---
Whoa, a real life troll
---
I’m a survivor main (I just like playing legion as well) and I’m almost never toxic on both sides 
---
Lucky
---
...you don’t seem to get that literally means nothing? Anyone can answer or not answer to skew the numbers either way. Lmao it’s like you don’t have common sense? But if you want to believe every poll on the internet, keep doing that. Dumb fuck. 
---
I believe it was a simple typo where they intended to write "float" but wrote "gloat" instead.
---
Fair enough. When I play him it actually requires more concentration than nurse, so I guess there's something weird with me.
---
Anyone else getting a quit game error and load into the game?
---
I have no idea :D
---
Does every patch to a game actually increase the size of the game file?
---
Why did you get downvoted lol, it’s actually a good thing that you don’t dc if you miss your decisive strike. 
---
I think there might be some kind of bug where a player either dies or DC's, but it still shows them as being alive in the UI? I played a killer game earlier where i had 2 on the hook and one was alive somewhere with only 1/5 gens done. The two on the hook died and the game ended??? 
---
In the end game score it showed that last person as if they were still alive.. Not escaped, not dead, and not DC'd.
---
It's a common error after updates. 
---
Go to your steam libary -&gt; right click on DbD -&gt; select properties -&gt; go to local files -&gt; verify integrity of game files. 
---
This should fix it.
---
It's a common error after updates.
---
Go to your steam libary -&gt; right click on DbD -&gt; select properties -&gt; go to local files -&gt; verify integrity of game files.
---
I had mine but with the fire at the home screen 
---
This is good. Gens get done way too fast, and it makes logical sense for game mechanics for multiple people on a gen to get done more quickly but also not have each additional persons adding 100 percent more efficient because now survivors have to make a decision about whether it’s better to spread out and work on more gens at once or try and focus more energy on rushing individual ones 
---
i tested in-game... it doesn't have a difference in vault speed anymore
---
Yes, I know why SWF is overpowered, you didn't need to explain it. Voice chat won't do anything, no one will use it, and it won't remove the excuse. They are doing fine currently with the plan of just narrowing the gap between solo and SWF and balancing the killers around that. 
---
I play Rank 1 trapper, SWF are downright cancerous, but not nearly as bad as they were by the end of 2017, it's getting better.
---
You know it’s 1v4 right?
---
You realize that someone who gets repeatedly screwed over by a perk that they don't know exists is going to stop playing, right? Let's say I went up against a slew of killers that all had Bitter Murmur, they kept finding me and hooking me, and I'm a new player. I don't know that perk exists and it's not a teachable perk, so even if I did know I could look at killer teachables, I can't find this perk.
---
I either get frustrated with the game and quit because I can't win, or I look at the end game screen and read that the killer was running Bitter Murmur and read what it does. You're taking one of those options away from me now. Because I'm sure as hell not sitting around with my thumb up my ass for 6-7 minutes while the other 3 randoms in the game hide, do gens, and eventually escape if I'm frustrated with the game.
---
Also, a very large portion of SWF teams get overly altruistic and all rush a hook, making for easy wins. They just aren't the SWF that you remember, because people tend to remember 1 bad experience for every 10 good experiences. You most likely run into more SWF than you realize because they aren't the typical 3p purple flashlight with Odd Bulb Claudette tryhards that this sub loves to whine about
---
Yeah there improving the spawn points of the totems 
---
Oh I see now, thank you, sir!
---
1v5?  what lol
---
True but it’s not how the game was meant to be played and as a solo player of both sides it only screws me over and I’m tired of it
---
Honestly this is the best Mori animation out of all the killers. Hope the others will get a rework of their mori soon too!
---
Why? So some fucking immersed Claudette can reap the benefits of doing nothing? Fuck that.
---
I've done this very thing. It doesn't always work
---
*but when it does*
---
This game isn't a game of hide and seek, it's more like cat-and-mouse. It's a multiplayer game, and all skill in this game comes from interacting with the other team (and your teammates). The chases are the main component of dead by daylight, not holding m1 and crouch all game.

I’m a survivor main and play both sides, but I believe the game is in favor of survivors. I usually play solo, so the change sucks that I can’t see he killer’s build if I escape or die early. Honestly though it’s necessary for SWF because it’s extremely unfair for a team to know your loadout in game. 
---
When did i ever say i wasn't good enough to down them again? You said it was a "counter" to DS, which it just isn't. It's simply letting them use it
---
Good, next time don't try that toxic 360
---
They finally fixed the co-op action ritual. Right as i finished it after 2 months.... Lol
---
It’s not hard to get 15K+ bloodpoints as survivor assuming the killer doesn’t facecamp/tunnel you. 
---
&gt;But I believe if there were additional points for TEAM actions
---
Playing as a team already gives you bonus co-op points... like doing gens together.. and saving other players...
---
And continuing to earn points after dying is not only impossible at this stage of the game, but it’s not a good idea. Players will just purposely die and go afk and farm bloodpoints.

Thanks a lot.
---
I'm loving the reception, this is one nice community it seems, and I'm glad to finally be part of it.
---
Is this a /s?
---
The movement is def different, it just feels different, and no I have always played at 60 frames and am still playing at 60 frames. There is a definite difference in the way your character spins around than last patch. 
---
Yes, they can escape through the hatch but not the gates with a RBT on
---
gogo gadget skates
---
Altho that would be a neat perk. Stop totem glowing 
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, I always broke that fucking book whenever I saw it.
---
The game is full of garbage people who disconnect and think that’s fine. They don’t care about fucking other people’s enjoyment- that’s part of what makes them garbage people.

Can I ask why your whole account is just posting people’s twitch clips to subreddits?
---
So they buffed adrenaline? 
---
Thank youuuuu
---
He can hear the gen, but he cant hear the sounds your character makes while repairing. Its still not good though.
---
Same :(

I have other posts too, just sharing DBD moments on reddit.

You did a good job at the jungle gym, but when you saw he was trying to mindgame you/ run out the bleed out timer, you should of ran from the jungle gym. He would of most likely mind gamed himself and you would of gotten away and mended. Worst case scenario you get enough distance to safely start the chase again and try to find another opportunity to lose him. 
---
i am not 100% sure but i think we get the content from the ptb even if we dont decide to use it so when the release date comes we download less stuff
---
&gt;So we should play with friends but never talk to them, based on your idea.
---
It's not my idea. It's how the devs made the game. They've expressly stated you're not meant to communicate. It's why there's no voice chat in the game and why they'll never add it.
---
&gt;That destroys the idea of playing with friends.
---
No it doesn't. I play with friends on occasion. We never use voice chat, we have a blast.
---
&gt;It’s the exact same as, say, playing Rainbow Six or COD with friends, 
---
No. No it's fucking not. Those games aren't asymmetrical and those games aren't balanced around no voice chat. You're **meant** to communicate in those game. Communication doesn't negate half the game in those. If you honestly believe this is the same then you're completely clueless.
---
&gt;Besides, most groups of friends who play are very casual, myself included.
---
*Any* information you share is more than your meant to. Doesn't matter how little, doesn't matter how casual, it's still an extra unfair advantage.
---
Maybe the hook had to be nerfed because it was actually gloating to all the other hooks and they were getting jealous 
---
"also while you're at it buy me some coffee"
---
Sorry, I didn't know that. I got the game last month.
---
New wraith ad on cool! 
---
I’m new, what’s SWF
---
I had ruin last until the end of the game earlier with this exact spawn. Even with a generator right next to it, no one saw it. 
---
You rolled a 1 for dexterity. Window vault failed.
---
Don't be a moron 
---
Oh well thank you :D
---
Which is one of the fun parts of DbD. Trying to figure out the perks and add-ons the killer has. And then playing around them. 
---
Kate has some decent beginner Perks like dance with me,wich hides all your scratch marks after fast vaulting a window. If you. Combine that with feng mins lithe ( dlc character ) your chance of losing the killer is pretty high. 
---
Jakes Perk Iron will will get rid if your gruns of pain making it easier to hide while injured
---
With Megs Quick and Quiet you can fast vault window or jump in lockers without making any noise ( after it gets activated, it has a short cooldown)
---
Windows of Opportunity by Kate is great for beginners because it shows you the aura of nearby pallets wich is nice until you know where common pallet spawns are.
---
And to get Bloodpoints easier go and get Davids We're gonna life forever, making it easier for you to get all the other Perks
---
I haven't seen anything to indicate that Technician has been buffed
---
Why the progress bar is red while I m repairing using the perk "Prove Thyself"? It should not be yellow?
---
I’m sure you aren’t one of those toxic legions (hopefully). But still if I saw you in a game I would shit myself 😂😂
---
I’ve said this in the past, this sub’s content quality is plummeting. Sorting by hot feels like sorting by new sometimes. If it’s not a joke of some kind, it’s some post circle-jerking about dedicated servers that gets 1K+ upvotes it doesn’t deserve. 
---
This sub used to be so much better.
---
Wasn't there talk about adding more rare items to the killers blood web as well?  Any change on that?
---
That isn't a group or squad event like "squad" with your friends is. What games with "squad" features  don't want communication?
---
Survive with friends
---
....
---
It's common knowledge. It's been *known* since the beta. They've mentioned it multiple times. Your ignorance doesn't change facts. And the only "very silly thought" was yours.
---
But [here's] (https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000444206-Is-voice-chat-available-in-game-) an instance where they say voice chat is not intended.
---
Were 4 players are can group up and go against a random killer. It’s hated mostly because of coms 
---
Nope, not a bug. From the 2.5 patch notes,
---
“Fixed an issue with generator repair efficiency for multiple Survivors working on the same generator. The efficiency debuff (-10%) should now be applied at the correct rate.”
---
Simply put, yes you’re being penalized for having more than one person on a gen— that’s where that -10% comes in. I think they finally just changed it so that survivors can SEE they’re being penalized.
---
TLDR; it’s faster for you to do five gens separately than together.
---
but it creates a second objective with totems. do them before gens are done, or deal with a faster 1 shot killer. mending takes up your time and doesn't let you finish gens or else you go down. sounds like a second objective to me. similar to doctors tier 3 madness and pigs bear traps.
---
Must be a new bug
---
You are wrong mate
---
Sorry I was not clear, I meant how "the game is still balanced around assuming no SWF." I don't see any clear evidence of this and was wondering how you came to this conclusion.
---
I have nothing but time for this crossover. Drag Race Me To Hell chapter when?
---
Oh, cool :)
---
I don’t think Prove Thyself doesn’t work with generators now, sadly
---
Great work taking my words out of context, as you decided to ignore the portion saying how casual teams often include lots of unnecessary sound and talk. Half of my games is just talking with my friends and giving some blood points to killers. And, as someone who plays siege, it’s definitely possible to win without chat, but the chat helps, much like with DBD.
---
I know the struggle. Waiting for so long just to get a bad game sucks. My friend has been seriously considering quitting the game because of some stuff like legion moonwalking and other bs but hopefully we can all get through it :)
---
Wraith buffed? Lol
---
All it really affects is NOED, everything else you should already know by the time someone dies.
---
I also like messing with hooks but thanks for the tip!
---
Claudette’s has to be my favorite, my least favorite is probably Adam’s. His animation almost makes him look concerned/nervous, and judging by his backstory it doesn’t feel right.
---
Literally unplayable 
---
Thanks, I know disconnects are frustrating on both ends, I just feel if it comes to one last person alive after disconnects, wouldn’t you want to make it fun? It was a lost match anyway with the way the killer tunneled the other people. 
---
Running blood warden, noed, spirit fury, pretty much any perk that takes time to engage. HmMMMmMMmMMmmmMmmmMmMMmmMMM
---
If not for the need to hear it as a survivor, I would like that, whenever I play him, I just hear that incessant noise from it in the menu and the offering screen and the game. Pretty annoying
---
Yes it’s getting better. But if they added voice chat in-game there would be no gap between SWF and solos.
---
Any buff they add for solos right now is also added to SWFs so the gap will never be closed unless the gap is removed entirely.
---
Is that your business?
---
Since the update release today on Xbox one it does seem a little smoother than before, but still not the best :/
---
Username checks out
---
1) Co-op gens
---
2) cleanse totems
---
3) Pallet Stun the killer
---
4) get hook rescues
---
5) escape (obvious, but 5k is the single biggest scoring event) 
---
These are the most effective BP/ time gains. 
---
Always be doing something that gives points. Dont crouch and hide when the killer is distracted, do gens. Dont hide and wait for the killer to leave the hook, do gens. 
---
Have you played Legion before the patch? You lost all peripheral vision during a frenzy &amp; it was nausea inducing.
---
Yeah it seems to be a major skillgap between red ranks and purple, which is kinda weird imo (although you still get potatoes at red ranks somehow). 
---
Although pig is a hard one because she's not that good, and her rbt comes down to rng on whether or not it slows down the game a little or a lot. For any non-top tier killer the recommended build, especially at red ranks, is usually spirit fury + enduring + ruin + your choice of perk. 
---
As for getting looped I would advise against using her power to mindgame unless you can crouch underneath the pallet and know that the survivor is still around the loop. Although generally her crouch is quite useless because it takes too long and she's too slow while crouching. Can be good for getting closer to survivors working on gens if you get your distances right and manage to have an obstruction to block survivor's fov opportunity to see you. Although even with that in mind it's generally better to just exit out of crouch and walk after the survivor once you spot them anyway to secure the hit. Hopefully you know all of the ups and downs of her crouch power anyways.
---
As for her rbts I would recommend only having 1 on at a time, unless you are losing severely. This enables you to be able to put multiple on once you get down to 1 gen left (which is when you do want to slow the game down as much as possible). 
---
But all in all it's mostly to do with having sound decision making and being able to do those optimal turns at loops. Never go for ds unless you have to, make the call on whether or not it's better to hit a survivor once and let them get away, or if you'd prefer to chase them down, give up when survivors go to certain loops if you already know what their exhaustion perk is, etc. 
---
Also optimal turning is just practice, always try to hug the loop as closely as possible, while not getting stuck on anything. Skilled survivors optimally around loops which allows them to do more loops against killers who aren't as optimal, also watch for dead hard on skilled survivors and don't always swing at the pallet unless you can guarantee a spirit fury or a hit, a missed hit can help the survivor to loop again or get to another nearby loop. 
---
I've never had someone encapsulate my feelings in a post so well.
---
You can guess these by the end, and even if you can't you are likely to know at least 2 perks.  The strength of SWF comes from comms, not knowing the killer perks.  This should have happened a long time ago.  Yes it's a killer buff vs SWF, but so much more is needed for balance between killers and SWF groups.
---
Just some context. Update to 2.5.0 and played my second game of the day, and well.. I hit a Claudette from uncloaking and got stuck on the hitbox of a tree.
---
Ruins gonna be godly till people learn these new spots. 
---
Was thinking about it
---
 I bet Freddy is a boss at generators. 
---
While I do agree with many points of this statement I would like to clarify that all flashlights blind at the same speed, regardless of addons. A yellow flashlight with no addons will "blind you during animations with no counter play." Most popular flashlights combos now typically include use time and duration/intensity of the blind. I would also argue there is some counter play like facing a wall on survivor pickup, or just taking the blind (mid chase like window or pallet) and using directional audio to follow them (easier if they are injured without iron will)
---
Can't really blame them, playing killer on PS4 is absolute hell.
---
[I mean, for one, you're blind apparently.](https://i.imgur.com/nGGoaeg.png)
---
And it does much more than the description says, hence why it affects exit gates, cleansing totems, etc. The reason it does this is because they simply made it action speed, and vaulting is considered an action. Resilience and Spine Chill used(? not sure if they still do) the same coding, and Resilience affected EVERY action.
---
It's pretty hard to get evidence for that now considering there's no real videos documenting it, and it's been patched out now, but I'll see what I can do. I'll edit it in if I find anything.
---
Dude went from yellow to green to purple flashlight in one game lmao
---
Ah, neat.  I had read them the other day but must have skimmed past that.  Now I have a reason to grind Feng Min for her perks I guess, poor Jake is still the red-headed stepchild tho.
---
You didn't read it clearly thoroughly then.
---

Bottom of the screenshot.
---
I want any match I ever end up playing as legion to let the survivors have a button to say this but like super bland and cheesy and it always sounds off in the distance
---
I feel like the best spirit perks are those that give the exposed effect. I personally love Make Your Choice when using speed addons and find that works really well. No-ed is always a good choice for lower ranks, and Devour hope is good because the spirit is able to get easy pulls off totems especially with Thrill Of The Hunt.I think it’s also very important to have a tracking perk, whether that be BBQ, Spies From The Shadows with the recent update, bloodhound/sloppy butcher with Fathers glasses, or even predator/stridor. Hex Ruin is a very important perk and can be coupled well with Discordance to apply Gen pressure which she lacks.
---
[Everytime I open the game I get this error message.](https://imgur.com/iNDngqs) I changed the resolution in the gamefiles but I don't know if that is the reason I get this message.
---
Wait what the fuck I love spine chill now
---
And yea I am blind lol
---
Breaking news =)
---
Again, like others have tried patiently explaining to you and in different ways hoping it gets through, sharing educated guesses are less effective than communicating something 100% certainty. I think part of the confusion we're all having is that you need this point explicitly laid out for you. 
---
Legion is balanced
---
Had a very similar game myself. No gens done, downed a David. Hooked him, used BBQ to find someone else, and he DC’d. Okay, that’s one less to worry about. I chase down another David, oh wow, he DC’s too on his first hook. Just a Bill and a Nea left, alright. I see both of them running toward the hook that the 2nd David was on before he disconnected, so I down the Bill and look for the Nea briefly. Can’t find her, and since only one gen was done through all of that I decide I can hook the Bill. I can hear his groans of pain but I can’t pinpoint where he is. This poor guy uses his Unbreakable right in front of me and I immediately down and hook him. Nea manages to get another gen, and Bill one-hooks himself. I decide to just let her get the hatch because she was doing all the work and with two DC’s she deserved it.
---
Tired of ruin getting destroyed?
---
Try NOED nurse!
---
I think it's crazy that you decided to wait it out until everyone else stopped arguing because their points all got debunked then started trying to make the same points they did
---
That's correct, which is why I assume she won't get anything
---
Same here, a 3k is the new 4k for me. Unless I slug, I've got basically no chance of getting that last person in most cases.
---
The reason you can't see it so much in-game is because it's 6%. When Fire Up came out, people thought it wasn't working because the percentage was so small. It's the same deal with Spine Chill. The effect is more noticeable if you stacked Resilience/Spine Chill.
---
Yea yea I fucked up there
---
And are we certain that it doesn’t work on resilience anymore?
---
That hook called me a noob!
---
Why do I see so many RPDR memes on this damn sub of all places lol
---
Not epic as someone who runs Resilience. 
---
I mean, that part is obvious. But you said 3/4 perks in the first 2 minutes.
---
Holy crap, hahhaha, what a rollercoaster ride that video was.
---
I seriousely didn't know xD
---
Adjusting the types of vaults and their speed was necessary game balance.

[Here's a video of when you could stack perks, showing that Resilience boosts vault speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHP63TKifHY)
---
As a killer I've noticed, seemingly coordinated, teams blow up my perks by either triggering crows (with hopes I have Spies in the Shadows) or intentionally miss skill checks to distract me. Not sure if intentional or coincidental, but thought it was a clever tactic.
---
Me too!  I couldn't even tell what was happening until I was dead!
---
Did you want me to clarify that it's 80% of the time you pedantic fuck?
---
Either in for a nice easy game or a super long game lol
---
As a big time SWF player I support it. This change was asking to implement itself long time ago.
---
BUT. Why the heck do you have to rob EVERY Survivor? 
---
Low-level Survivors who die first are punished for no reason. Are you still learning the game, you died and you don't know why? Well, now you can either wait for the game to end, or go fuck yourself. BHVR, what is your problem, seriously?
---
That would have pissed me off so much. Like get over yourself. And then she ends up getting the purple flashlight. Like seriously, lame.
---
No, it can definitely spawn here on the Swamp as well. Unsure about other maps though.
---
It’s fucking annoying how the conversation here is always making SWF equal to solo rather than being fair to killer
---
*solo is not that hard*
---
When I'm killer, if anyone DCs, everyone lives...unless you're a dick. 
---
"gg ez baby survivor"
---
No, you were simply in the wrong and are now tilted because of it.
---
How are you affected by this change in any way as a solo player? 
---
Do you regularly message layers who've died to check the killers loadout or something?
---
Either way you're either part of the reason this change happened or it doesn't have any effect on you.
---
But this happened to me too when I was using the new prove thyself..?? 
---
Pretty sure its a jar or something like that
---
I’M CRYING ANNE FRANKENSTINE 
---
This is why pig is s tier
---
This is some next level of leaking right there
---
This question is somewhat lore related. Are the killers banned from touching the pallets by the Entity? You’d think the killers would just knock them down before the survivors run into them. 
---
Really? I got the game for PC recently and it seems much easier to find games as Killer than as Survivor (althought tbh i got rekt as both)
---
No it applies the effect to all survivors. 
---
2 survivors on a gen have 180% progression speed (-10% for each survivor) 
---
Prove thyself ads 10% per survivor to each survivor so 2x10% bonus making it 200%. 
---
For 4 Survivors it would be 4x30% so 120% in total.
---
So instead of the 360% repair speed for 4 survivors on a gen, you know have a 480% speed ( 80% faster than when no debuffs for multiple survivors on a gen would be applied)
---
it was good to work with you fam hope the killer doesnt catch you, see ya at the exit gate or maybe not
---
How dafuq? Nevermind I'll mind my own business 🤡
---
What is it 2009?
---
Are you doing it jokingly? Because it honestly seems like you are doing it unironically and it just, it isn't right.
---
You don't need to put 'when' after 'tfw'.
---
sir is this your /s? i think you dropped it.
---
I'm wondering where you think you debunked the idea that guessing a loadout and knowing it for certain are the same thing or just as effective? Though I can't blame them for giving up, I'd imagine it's less because that you "debunked" the theory of guessing=knowing, and more that a third explanation to some one pretending to be dense would be a waste of their time.
---
Actually, it is much easier to blind killers and is faster if you have increased beam tightness and accuracy. It is very hard to look away with someone on your shoulder when it takes less than a second to blind.
---
Facing a wall isn't possible if there isnt a wall or if they're too far away from one, so that's a very situational solution. If the survivor is not near a wall there's nothing to be done except hope the flashlight wielding survivor fails. 
---
And hopefully its easier to track with this new patch, the audio has been really wonky since the release of Legion and its been very hard to track survivors off of audio unless there's no music. 
---
Best boi Bing Bong
---
There's literally a signature on it lol
---
Some survivors just want to watch the world burn.
---
Again, from the 2.5 patch notes, under Known Bugs,
---
“A Survivor who has Prove Thyself equipped does not gain any repair speed bonus for each survivor working on the same generator.”
---
It’s listed as being fixed internally, so hopefully BHVR will be able to take care of that pretty quickly. But for now, you’re still only receiving the penalty from working cooperatively on a gen, which would lead to the red progress bar.
---
They don't count as a kill but you get extra points for every survivor that disconnects
---
There's a glitch with prove thyself though I've been experiencing every other game. It gives a thanatophobia life debuff if more than one person has it on while on a gen. It only happens when someone else is doing a gen with me and only if it's just one. If I get two survivors or three it's normal. 
---
I get to post this next week!
---
yeah tryhards never show mercy and play games to win every single time, personally if i get two dcs its farming time
---
I think the point isn't that they are worried about their team mates, but that watching their team mates die makes them fear for their own life. I think in this context Thanatophobia is still more accurate.
---
Lol it's almost like you have no real argument. Play SWF for a few games and you'll find out how easy it is to read a perk build. It's not a guess when its accurate more than 99% of the time
---
Spirit isn't so good on this map, too many windows, it's easy to block her  
---
It's super good for Pig
---
Oh i thought leveling it made it a shorter range 😅 mustve misread it
---
Like do you get a lot of points for co op doing so ? 
---
I’d be farming oink
---
[Sound of invisible Squadette screaming echoes across the swamp]
---
Honestly when you got a name like legion and the only in game difference is boobs or no boobs there's an issue lol. Good idea I like this way more then stab and run 
---
You did after you die
---
I'm sorry for that horrible teammate and she seeing her do all that frustrates me, but damn I also get frustrated with  the killer who doesnt kill the assholes; She saw the Claudette sandbag, gave no shits about it and let  her get away. I see this type of shit in my game I would go full ham on the asshole cause I easily empathize with people who just wanna have a good time, but got to deal with someone who wants to ruin their fun.  
---
Just to clarify something: I'm not shitting on the Hag for how she played, she can play however she wants; I just expressed my frustration without being disrespectful.
---
Thanks you for the explanation my good man 
---
Had a twitch streamer tell me to kill myself earlier. Checked their channel, first rule was to be friendly.
---
Gotcha.
---
But can u tell me what is written there?
---
That's not new sadly, you have to hit a survivor to unblock yourself
---
Yeah I get really confident too when I'm in an SWF about their loadouts, many times I can guess correctly which perks they're running, at least two or three. Probably more often than I can't. Do you think that's just as effective as knowing for certain, more effective than knowing for certain, or just as effective as knowing for certain
---
Kooeri 
---
Koopri 
---
Kooepri?
---
SFM prob
---
It literally tells you what to do? Right-click the game in your steam library, go to properties, select the "Local Files" tab and click on "Verify integrity of game files.".
---
If you really cant read a build then I doubt you play SWF lmfao
---
You can say the same thing about killer though, if the killer gets a good spawn/start they can get a 4k without any gens being completed
---
Man, this is tough. But I can't really blame the killer either.  
---
3vs1 or DCs are really common atm. When I play killer, I try to avoid these rounds and just DC. But since it's nearly every 3rd round, I don't do that anymore. Also I can't just farm everytime.   
---
So sometimes I'm without mercy and just kill them. Just to move on.
---
Man, I really wish that a round just doesn't start if there are 3 or less people joining in
---
I think it’s interesting and well done by the devs if the killer has to leave the hook in order to get more points. If that’s what this is, I feel  like they are on the right track in that we may someday get an extra objective for both sides. One where survivors are slowed some on gens, but the killer also is required to leave the hook to do something as well. 
---
The game still crashes on loading screen all the time, pretty god job so far BHVR.
---
Sorry for my ignorance but what was the change? 
---
"Why do people bitch about camping when I camp them?"
---
Its probably their first time ever going against a nurse, probably had to look up what a 'nurse' is lol
---
I pretty much agree. My swf teams is pretty chill, and we’re not that good...but generally we still know what at least three of the killer’s perks are by the time someone gets hooked the first time. 
---
Koori 
---
Spaghetti code, you fix something, 3 more bugs appear. Atleast this one is not game breaking! 
---
Aww you shouldn't have cut it at the Mori.
---
It would only heal 25% slower

Yeah that's true. But a survivor DCing will never cost you a pip at least
---

I WAITED 30+ MINUTES IN A LOBBY FOR SOMEONE TO POP HAUNTED GROUNDS (VS A SPIRIT WITH NO RUIN,) GET FACECAMPED AT 4 GENS TO GO FOR HALF OF STAGE 1, UNHOOKED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE KILLER, TUNNELED OFF HOOK DESPITE BOTH OF US BEING WOUNDED, THEN WATCHED MY 3 TEAMMATES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MAP SEARCHING CHESTS, BREAKING DULL TOTEMS, OR HIDING IN CORNERS *WITH 4 GENS TO GO,* FOR THE ENTIRETY OF MY STAGE 2.
---
1 I can answer. If they run far, cloak. If they don't run that far, stay uncloaked. 
---
There should be a specific currency you can earn during the event to which you can spend on an the outfit. Which is how they've done it in the past. 
---

What? Considering the 'proper' way to use a flashlight is to time it alongside animations the killer is locked into, such as picking up a survivor, breaking a pallet, or vaulting a window, how exactly in your mind do you "counter" that? The only real counterplay to any kind of flashlight play is facing walls during pickup animations but far more often than not the downed survivor and killer are not close enough to a wall to use that to their advantage.
---
Flashlight's aren't 'good' compared to some other items and addons but your post is blatantly wrong for the sake of making a 'lol you must be bad' comment.
---
I think “worth it” is a pretty situational thing. For my normal build? There’s no chance I’d replace any of my ~meta~ perks with Prove Thyself. But I’d consider running it in a SWF gen rush type of build.
---
Well, yeah, I obviously do that after they pop a generator 
---
I legitimately thought the killer was lag switching or something bc the other survivor was walking just fine but then I asked them after the match and I started laughing.

Yesssssss
---
these goddamn tard ochido fans being dickheads
---
i love this
---
Honestly I only would rather have a team be more objective based than altruistic. I dreamed for the day that I get facecamped and actually see 3 survivors on 3 different gens. Instead, I usually get one survivor running to a locker for BBQ and two others crouching and watching the killer facecamp me. 
---
The way to punish camping is to spread out and do objectives across the map. If a killer continues to only get 1K from camping then he/she is going to be less inclined to keep doing it. It sucks being the one camped, but being overly altruistic encourages this style of gameplay.
---
Right lol. He admits to camping (and lets be real, who here actually believes the 15 seconds part), and then hates being called a camper? Don’t partake in chat if you don’t wanna hear it, no one is going to say GG to a camper.
---
She’s really not. I went to no perks or add ons to learn how to play her and then I never left it. I like the challenge. Im also completely against tunneling or camping or juggling. 
---
Is that because what I heard of no console players trying to learn her? Lol 
---
Is this a new killer?
---
I don’t even have the slightest bit of a following to be honest. 
---
Yeah they are, I finally can hear injured survivors again and the footsteps
---
That's a little off. It's number of generators *completed* = number of survivors + 1. So with 2 survivors, it will appear when there are 2 generators left (i.e. 3 gens completed).
---
Another way to look at it is: By default, the hatch only appears when all the generators are done. For each survivor who dies, it appears 1 generator earlier.
---
I agree with Jack it depends on your build the build I use is wglf sc dead heard and leader so I would replace leader
---
This is why I'm gay
---
I’d love to stream but I really doubt I would gain a following. 
---
Me too oink
---
Nice edit lmfao
---
rwice in a row apparently...
---
You face a wall when picking a survivor up or if there is no wall you bait a pickup and make the survivor with a fl come to you and you just down them.
---
&gt;Obsession means killer runs Rancor?
---
No, but when you’re the obsession and you see the Killer’s aura after the first gen is finished...and then tell your friends. 
---
Even if you don't really care for LF, you can still reap (some of) the benefits of BBQ since he starts with it. And if you hate him, then you know never to play him again. Or just play with a killer you like. Personally, I try to play as the killers as I level them up, since I have no idea if I'll ever play them again.
---
Drop a link if you've got one, I'll give you a follow. Sure some other people would be interested.
---
It’s just as much a counter to DS as finding all the totems is to noed 
---
Has it happened yet?
---
2 live
---
I think its just a visual bug. It felt faster for me. 
---
They didn't go through with the changes that would have fully put it on top is more accurate.
---
Currently selfcare is a choice that you can get around (especially with running high charge count medkits), new one though would have pretty much forced everyone to run it, or no one to run it.
---
Try chasing one while the other two do gens and wait for two gens to complete then start eliminating people 
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯  fastest way I know how to complete a 1v3
---
Reupload because I forgot to flair
---
Lmao ik I was playing with randoms.. not to sure what they were up to 
---
Lmao there it is again!! We could talk about the weather or something instead, we don't have to talk about you abandoning your argument in the face of a simple question you know you can't answer.
---
Pretty chilly here in Phoenix today, how's it going over there? 
---
Does this really kill anything other than the perk that stops you from leaving though. Most games even if we know Noed is on we still play the same way. We usually get totems and if not we all agree that we’d find the hex totem later.
---
And the perk that stops you from leaving is still trash in my opinion.
---
Run Quick and Quiet with Lithe. You can silently vault and then use the speed burst to drop the line of sight. 
---
What is a good general strategy for killers beyond generator patrolling? 
---
It's not a fucking counter to DS if they get to use DS. What the fuck is wrong with you
---
Because when you get camped it sucks for the survivor and screams inadequacy on the killers part. Personally, i don't really care if i get camped but it looks sooooo weak on the killer. Last night i played against a certain unnamed streamer who camped me until i died on hook with hillbilly. He was really salty because he whiffed 3 times around a pallet loop and then whiffed again at a t-wall window vault. I popped on his stream and listened to him bitch about auto-aim as he revved his chainsaw and gave me a big phat camping. Wow dude i can't believe you have ANY viewers, this is so boring watching me bleed out.
---
Today I encountered the worst teammate I've evr encountered. I was playing against a huntress with huntress lullaby. I'm doing a gen in the middle of the map. All 3 of my teammates are injured. One goes down and the other 2 end up next to me. Me and Ace heal up Quentin. As soon as Quentin is healed up he runs off on the direction of the downed survivor (the killer didn't imidiately pick them up). I heal Ace. We finish the generator together. While we do that, our downed teammate gets put on the hook. 2 seconds later, they get taken off of the hook and downed again. They get put back on the hook and again, 2 second later they get "rescued" again. One teammate down and huntress lullaby now has 3 stacks. Me and ace were doing a gen together and ace messes up a skill check, so I get chased and downed. Wouldn't you know it, Quentin comes in and tries to "save" me. Luckily, the killer hit Quentin before he got to me and thus after I got off the hook, the killer downed quentin. Neither Ace or I went for the save and Quentin died a slow and painfull death. I am surprised we still got 4 generators done, but I got hooked and decided to commit suicide. Ace got found and downed, but Huntress gave him the hatch. The end

Thank you

thank you
---
From the Known Bugs section of 2.5’s patch notes,
---
It’s been fixed internally, so hopefully it’ll be fixed soon, but for now it seems like Prove Thyself isn’t giving the bonus to the person running it, so you just have the usual -10% from cooperatively working on a gen.
---
I personally mapped struggle to Mouse Wheel Down. It hits a lot of inputs for minimal effort. And you don't have to be super fast in between scrolls.

dont worry its still faster compared to not having it on when 2 or more people are on the same gen. 
---
R.I.p leader lol 
---
You only get notified on hex totems. You get a ding sound when a dull was done which indicates that you lost a token. 1 token is = to 1 totem.
---
Cool let me put it in its own post then so you it's easier for you to avoid:
---
Do you think those guesses are less effective as knowing with 100% certainty, *more* effective than knowing with 100% certainty, or *just* as effective as knowing with 100% certainty?
---
Heh, I've seen this comment somewhere before
---
I just accidentaly pressed L2 when putting my controller my lap and right on that moment I did “ready up” making me Jake instead of Nea :-(
---
ru laughing as the entity is taking me there askjxkskdjhgs
---
Unfortunately this patch didn't fix the loading screen crashes.. R.I.P. Escape Cake and Survivor Pudding. :/
---
np! :)
---
How fucked up is their code for this to even happen, I'm baffled
---
I played a game last night where the sound was so spot on I was able to follow and down someone while blinded so I dont understand what had to be fixed
---
This looks incredibly survivor sided 🤷‍♂️
---
I hope this doesn't mean way more survivors than killers playing with the points being like that.
---
The only visual and auditory notification you get is on hex totems. You get an auditory notification only when a dull was cleansed.
---
There are only ever 5 totems at the start of the game on every map.
---
That heavy metal menu music was lit though
---
Just a suggestion: maybe put it as NSFW content
---
I think people took more issue with your phrasing and tone then they did with what you said about Adrenaline. 
---
You just sound like a Jackass. 
---
[When the Huntress can't hit a single hatchet so you start messing with her.](https://youtu.be/AkQYbIc6zUw?t=181)
---
I always press the sensitivity button on my mouse and do a couple 360s
---
I had two or three games in a row playing as the Doctor where one of the survivors would drop out while I was running Class III Restraint and Calm. Very annoying.
---
Fixed an issue that caused a hook in front of the warehouse to gloat in the Coal Tower map.
---
I know it's probably a typo for float, but I still wish I could've met this cocky hook :(
---
I did it on purpose lol
---
Lithe combined with Quick and Quiet is good, then you can also throw in Dance with Me. 
---
Someone thinking of a solution rather than arguing/being salty. Nice 
---
Then play the trapper on the tutorial mode then. Idgaf. 
---
cleanse before gens, my man
---
Can't be certain but i've heard that this is a bug for people with uncapped FPS.
---
And neither is killer vs swf unless you play a bottom teir killer
---
Amen to that brethren!
---
Even I can't comprehend how this is possible, but it happens. This is actually the second time a game leaked content by having a bug only in the spanish language, first one was Smite. 
---
I just mean in terms of mechanics, that's why there are less killers on console. The bad framerate, slow turning speed, shitty auto aim can add up to a pretty unfun experience sometimes.
---
Thanks ❤
---
Does everyone clap when you win?
---
I"m always having the red arrow using the perk. Don't if it's a visual bug or not. Feels like I'm not repairing as fast.
---
Being able to choose Freddie has always been a bug. 
---
Probably because Trixie Mattel is a horror fan who streams DBD on twitch.
---
You'll have a bunch of people running around looking for totems instead of doing gens. That's generally what happens. You can only be in one place at once so keep that in mind.
---
Most people flat out ignore her once they learn of the frame rate issues when blinking. For most people its like watching a power point capped at -4 frames a second.
---
Maybe its not noticeable if you just play console but if you've ever seen a pc you know that this game is painful to play
---
Thanks to you both for the guidance!  
---
Not exactly. Think of it this way; Thanatophobia is a fear of dying or being dead, meanwhile Necrophobia is the fear of the dying and dead. Fearing the states that others are in, not yourself. Therefore, once someones dead and gets dragged into the sky, it would make sense to stop worrying about it now that the presence of coming death is no longer there.
---
Have they still not fixed that murdering someone still isn’t considered “an offensive action”?
---
You planning on killing yourself?
---
If you know how to run loops SWF aren't really a problem
---
It's not because he's hard to win against, it's because he is unfun to play against

I’m already dead on the inside.

Happened to me too. I ve capped fps at 144

---
Sound was ruined last patch. Survivors would often make no noise, grass made no sound, it was just bad for killer.
---
Wraith is the true king of camp! Poor LF always takes the heat.
---
you mean complaints about Camping, noed, tunneling, Moris and using the best add ons
---
Legion doesn't get tunnel vision anymore and can actually use their power for mobility. OP KILLER GAME IS DEAD GG BEHAVIOR GOING TO GO PLAY CIV.
---
This sub man. A little more FoV and a little more mobility isn't going to kill you.
---
i think you mean nut ron 😍😍😍
---
I’m living for these (this should’ve been a double Shante)
---
Yea that’s not a bad thing. Especially for those hating noed
---
lol...so true!  Only downside to do that, is there seems to be a TON of them, like every game or every other has a T.TV superstar in it. 
---
Distortion goes off to indicate BBQ 
---
I've found DS to make or break my games as both killers and survivors when it came to surviving as a survivor and killing the Obsession. Seriously. Its really strong. 
---
"Yup. That's me. You're probably wondering how I wound up in this mess..."
---
You assume.
---
Those things should have been there to begin with.  Making playing the Legion more user-friendly/less shitty is a good thing, regardless if the power is still somewhat fundamentally against the rest of the games design.  I would like to see a rework/some change to the Legion to allow for more skillful play from the killer and more counterplay from the survivors, but I'm still all for QoL changes for Legion like this even if they are "buffs".
---
I wonder if putting in a "lost progress" ticket is worthwhile for this. I've burned thousands of BP of addons and offerings, not to mention fuckloads of time staring at a loading screen, all to have it vanish because the game is fucked.
---
Those were great perks, what a dream it’d be to have that chapter 
---
TARD+
---
Jesus murphy
---
Naaaa. I'd say both sides are pretty bad. Was playing on PS4 and I got put into a group with the 4 survivors I just went against. What followed was an onslaught of just pure toxicity and BS.
---
All of which are trumped by what I said along with DS.
---
it's the most common phrase you come up on twitter and on meme subreddits like r/coaxedintoasnafu , of course I'm gonna say that
---
also no lol italian's political compass is different than the american's and even if I was calling them creatures makes you look really dumb
---
I love how in these it's always Nea and The Entity watching. Keep it up, these are great!
---
Fuck you Behavior
---
Oh, sorry, I misread your post. I thought you were saying that your three teammates all DCed after getting tunneled, but then the Killer let you finish the generators and escape through the hatch.
---
Infinite loading screens still not fixed btw
---
garbage devs every single one of them.
---
This is what the American education system has done to our youth. Stay woke and keep thinking that 6 and 0 are the same number.
---
Shitpost lvl 100
---
definitley not true.
---
Sure, both sides complain, but survivors are way louder in that regard
---
Yep, pretty much.
---
To be honest this change is a pain for any solo survivors. I'm still learning the game and knowing what the killer runs is important for any new survivor so they can learn the perks and what they do. Don't really feel like sitting through a whole match if I die early =/
---
Yeah, I'm glad you made this! I really dig your "organized pencil scribble" style, and I love experimenting with new art styles, so I might have to give it a shot myself! :P Do you mind if I use this for my Steam profile pic? 
---
A lot of perks can be strong if it fits the play style of the survivor/killer. And I believe you when you say that.
---
I would never run DS nor is it that strong in my opinion. But I have also trouble hitting the skill check (I also play on console) which is one of the reasons why I am not fond of the perk. 
---
It's hyperbole, stop being so needlessly specific. The point of the argument still stands.
---
That's a buff of Bubba. Didn't you read the patch notes?
---
&gt; overly concerned with minute details or formalisms, especially in teaching.      
---
You were simply wrong and you still are. I wasn't being pedantic, you were just an idiot.
---
You don't get any sacrifice points, but it does count towards the sacrifice emblem.
---
You can. It's not hard to download a program and instantly derank yourself 20 ranks. Quite a few streamers have been doing it for a good year.
---
lemme guess, you usually camp?
---
Repairing generators with a teammate now gives you -10% progression speed, that's why the bar is red.
---
9/10 I will go for it by prioritizing the totem and putting some trust in my teammates to do the right thing ( unhook and/or open the door). I really do enjoy saving people so most of the time I will risk myself to get the others out. 
---
This also depends on how everyone is playing. Rank 1 people aren't always pros but they atleast have some awareness I think. It usually works out okay in my experience, but I won't be mad if I die for someone else.
---
Looks like a simple copy-pasting mistake.
---
Haha 
---
It was definitely a buff for *self*care. In the PTB you could heal youself 25% faster than normal.

Because it's not drugs or booze, and therefore has no physical ailments.
---
Props for addressing it. I obviously disagree that educated guesses are just as effective as seeing the four perk icons directly. While the examples in your post aren't too difficult to discover yourself naturally, having the information communicated to you earlier rather than discovering it later(or too late) can be a really big benefit, depending on the perk and how accurate your guess was. There's room to be wrong when you're guessing, or to not know what they're running quickly enough for the information to benefit your teammates. No player is perfect.
---
It doesnt matter what your setup is. Only thing I cant tell is if it's an issue with the chest or the basement itself.
---
They might be healing when you find them, and BAM! 
---
Don't forget that super dangerous and deadly THIRD SEAL.

Thankfully. It's stupid to punish your team for a perk one person is running.

You're welcome! Have fun with the patch :)

I'm not sure there is a visual difference between the two - the wiki doesn't say so anyways. Only that his T3 posture changes if he has any tombstone add-on.

WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE

I think this is the first time, actually. 
---
Where it shows everyone's score at the end.  I don't know how you can have played the game at all and not know that.
---
You hide the totems so that active ones do not actually glow. Then suddenly totems become important little mini objectives instead of just o I’m sprinting and ignore anything that doesn’t glow.

I shouldn't have to run this shite perk to make this addon work

One bug that I really like when it happens is when the survivor dies and THEIR HAIR STAYS ON THE HOOK. It looks like a wig on a hanger, it's funny. I've also seen Pig's traps on hooks--
---
&gt;This was an edit after cry baby survivors put me in the negatives
---
I'm a killer main. I down-voted you. 
---
In fact, I've noticed that I often find myself down-voting your cry baby killer comments.
---
Survivors are allowed to complain about issues they have with the game. Killers are allowed to complain about issues they have with the game. Just because one side might have it worse doesn't mean we can't discuss issues with the other side too.
---
Why not? If you're gonna be a dick then you should have to own up to it. 
---
The producers are the spider tendrils with their dirty edits.
---
Unless the survivor is really good or right next to a pallet they just immediately go down again lol
---
You can feel even cooler by reading the title. 
---
I think you don't know how much effort goes into fixing this game. This patch has literally fixed a lot of bugs.
---
They know about loading issues too but it just takes time to fix them because it's not easy to fix certain issues.
---
You may not believe me, but I have actually studied this language since I was 14. It's one of the 14 Martian dialects. It's name is "efaeae". Unfortunately, my knowledge isn't advanced enough to understand what the man is saying, but if I could take a shot, he's saying that he sprayed pepper on his ass and it's hurting a lot, don't quote me on that though.
---
What a save!
---
The mods will delete it. That’s the reason- your complaint is with them.
---
It's still not countering DS. Do you know what a counter is? Just simply letting them do it is not a fucking counter. 
---
Such as?
---
The only thing swf hard counters is killers who rely on totems. 
---
My friend (we play on ps4) also opened a basement chest, but didn't get this bug. Not sure if he was lucky or not. I've heard that this happens a lot on PC, so it might be a PC problem. Try to message the devs about this problem.
---
Get patrouilled idiot
---
I really hope you’re joking.
---
He can play how he damn pleases. Every man on this earth has a given right to facecamp.
---
He should not receive harassment by assholes from this sub.
---
Oh yea, it’s also **against the sub rules** as well as Reddit’s rules themselves.
---
I know, just pointing out how pussification works. 
---
Glad to know that it's easily reproduced and not a networking issue. This is game breaking and needs to be addressed immediately. I'm hoping this doesn't cause any accidental bans because I've had to manually DC a few times already. 
---
I don’t get other killer’s mindsets. You are outplayed by a better player so what do you do? You hook them eventually and then just camp, ruining the game for yourself and the player who actually played amazing. It’s like survivors who do well and survive get punished because certain killers have anger issues.
---
I'll answer a question that's actually asked and not edited in after I reply to make it look like I'm avoiding it
---
Things like Bloodhound and Nurses, sure, they might catch the first 2 unaware, but that's still early enough to have the information to help the team.
---
Devour Hope or Make Your Choice might catch one guy off guard, but it won't catch another one. And that one guy who unhooked on MYC isn't even a guaranteed down.
---
Always clean a dull totem if you see one, it's free points, and helps prevent a case of the NOEDs. Always 99% a door when a survivor is being carried, free perk slot stolen from the killer (Blood Warden needs a buff to any hook after gates are powered real bad).
---
It takes less than a second to see something, open your mouth, and communicate the seen perk effect to your team. That should be more than enough time for everyone to adjust to that information.
---
Game is Shit for killers now that they added 16 safe pallets spawning 75% of the time.
---
It’s the most effective way to deal with it and makes the perk a non issue 
---
Maybe I’m not so rarted after all
---
Wrong post
---
So, I haven't really kept up with things since the "optimization" patch. How are things on consoles rn? Is the game playable?
---
There used be more crows on launch, but they nerfed the crap out of them due to peformance impact and object limitations on maps.   Another poorly designed feature that we are forced to live with.
---
It really should change, but this is not the purpose of the lost progress ticket. The devs have been very clear that offerings are fully consumed when the offering screen pops up. The infinite loading screen is an issue, but if you alt-f4 out of it and the game doesn’t start you don’t lose pips. Even if the devs would return your offerings, in the time it would take to file a report you could easily play 2-3 games, in which you could get like 50k+ points and get back many of the offerings you had. We all have to deal with this, even killers. If you use up survivor pudding or ebony mori and 2 or 3 people dc, you lose your offering and your addons. The lost progress ticket is for those who have experienced data wipes or issues with cloud storage, which could amount to many millions of bloodpoint a worth of levels, items, and teachables. The more false reports they get, the more time it will take for them to get to the more serious reports, and that is a big issue.
---
Yeah, this.
---
In all fairness, I've played both versions and the Nurse on console is basically god-tier since people get no experience with her, and if you downloaded the game, the frames aren't pure death.
---
They did. They added a new animation to the "medium speed vault" and made it 0.1 sec faster. Also you keep the momentum after the vault so i assume you move faster away fron the window? Idk hope it works well and we see less bullshit hits.
---
I think it's a bonus, not penalty. From the patch notes:
---
"For every other Survivor working on a generator within a 4m range, gain 10% repair speed bonus"
---
Tard+
---
Lmao you back-peddled so hard, I saw the comment you deleted, you know exactly where you were posting.

ToXiC. Lol that was great

Yes, I did, because I realized this was the wrong post. No one was a dick in this picture

Granted, barely anything survivors can do really shows any skill. Sitting on gens? No. Looping pallets? Not hard. Flashlighting a killer thats locked into an animation? Yawn.

That 1 gen  was done by me and I was stalling so they could do something 
---
Just looked on the official forums. 2 reports have already been posted and not\_Queen has already replied to both of them.
---
How do you guys play this game? Its like i need a radiation suit from all the cancer causing hatred. 
---
You can’t seem to see beyond your interpretation of the nature of the game apparently. There are plenty of matches I play where the other side does something awesome and we chat about it after the match, both having a good time. Fun isn’t a lump sum event.
---
Nothing should be owned up to because nothing happened

Prove thyself gives you the 10% speed bonus yes.
---
But now if their is 2 survivors working on a generator you get a -10% speed bonus, if 3 are working on it then its -20% etc.
---
Basically prove thyself makes it go at the original speed before the patch.
---
I like that actually ;-;
---
Hahaha RIGHT? This is part of the reason why I switched from PC to PS4. No one ever messages me on PS4 to tell me how terrible I am. I've only gotten one message &amp; it was a thank you from a Kate that I dropped on the hatch.
---
If someone is hooked down there you’ll probably have to use it to escape and save two people
---
😘
---
I was the killer. he is calling me a camper because they had one gen left and I kept circling the gens then hooking people near the gens.
---
For what it's worth, I'm mostly a green rank player (10~12) and there's almost no toxicity.  In my past ~50 games or so the most post-chat I've seen is, "gg" and "I suck at XYZ killer" or "thanks for dailies guys!"
---
That's about it.

---
Ignore the post game chat lol
---
They do have a small terror radius though, and not every generator is close enough to a safe area to make it there in time.  There is potential risk involved with not healing.  You may not be able to stop legion from injuring you again, but forcing frenzy use can still be valuable and that can be a strategic decision that you situationally make depending on the map/surroundings according to what is likely to be more optimal at the time.  That's a level of counterplay, even if it's not much, and taking that away would remove one of the few interesting legion specific decisions a survivor could make in a match.
---
Not getting your allies to heal you in 2019. 
---
Sitting in the corner holding SC for 40 seconds in 2019. 
---
Not just bringing a Medkit in 2019. 
---
Not running Autodiact or We’ll make it in 2018+1. Yikes. 
---
Love this meme
---
Yea, there is no reason not to run BBQ. It saves you so much time after hooking someone, you don't have to start checking every generator. Plus the bloodpoint boost is just the cherry on top.
---
I tested it today. With 3 people in a gen the gen rush is insane, I can't imagine with 4. The extra BP are too situational, sometimes get it sometimes not. I wouldn't change one of my usual perks for it, but it can be fun, specially with Bond.
---
infinite loading screens is NOT a new bug though
---
it's been in the game over a year ago and got fixed and was recently re-introduced a couple months ago. it SHOULD HAVE been fixed by not
---
2 years ago I would have let you escape.
---
1 year ago I would have let you do all gens and farm some points and then kill you.
---
Nowadays I kill you and move on, tough luck my dude but I won't waste my time because you got unlucky. Seeing as that is a sabotage box and I had a few SWF groups sabo all the hooks on my maps in the last games, this would probably be the right choice anyway.
---
Toasted.
---
Weird, never heard that from anybody and he is pretty low on almost every tier list.
---
Just like I assume all survivors have dead hard but really sometimes I just can't hit people for shit.
---
&gt;a little bit
---
sure, while my fucking dumbass teammates spend 8 minutes doing gens/fuck all/slowly urban evasioning to the hatch to start a 4 hour standoff
---
praise entity.
---
Because people that died would tell their living teammates what perks the killer had and living survivors aren't supposed to know that, it was literally cheating.
---
You know what the solution would be? Introduce a perk for survivors that makes it so you cannot be exposed by other perks, this way you can ignore NOED and be happy. What, you don't want to give up a perk slot to counter a perk? 
---
NOED is needed on weaker killers and it rewards sloppy play on good killers. It is like Ruin, too good but necessary at the same time. DS is not needed and introduces a mechanic in the game that punished killers for picking up a survivor they chased and downed in the first place. 
---
That's probably a bad idea tbh, being good at looping gets you camped/tunneled a lot. Just hiding is really easy and usually lets you not get hooked at all
---
:( sorry to hear
---
What, you don't like your PS4 to sound like a jet on the title screen?
---
I legit started getting angry for a sec while watching this as if it just happened to me 
---
It isn’t really the devs’ fault infinite loading screens happen. They happen as a result of survivor dcs and not being able to connect to the killer (which will improve with dedicated servers) or killer dcs which make the game not start at all (will also improve with dedicated servers). 
---
Fair enough, replacing your exact offerings will take more than 50k, but the chances of getting a bp offering higher than brown rarity in a level 50 web is pretty high. In addition, you are collecting items and addons that you would want anyways.
---
Ah I just thought it was cause it was 3.99 making it half the price of other DLC's but I guess thats just where theres no survivor its cheaper. 
---
&gt;Reverted the changes to Self-Care.
---
Phew I guess.
---
It doesn't always work, but lobby hopping for good ping is a good way to go about it. Check the bottom-right of your screen before readying up.

Here's you a link, and I remember it super clearly in the film. You could probably find a youtube clip of it, also it could be in the trailer. 
---
I'm just talking crap anyways, it doesn't really matter. =)
---
this is spine chill + resilience but on drugs
---
**i love it**
---
How about whoever gets to the hatch first wins it, killer can close it since he got there first and the survivor can jump through
---
Hey! I'm so flattered! I do but I don't draw much anymore (last time I drew something was on October last year!) ...so I wouldn't want you to follow an account that doesn't update :(
---
I wouldn’t consider it cheating, just giving them a heads up that the killer has noed or a mori. I didn’t really find no harm... at least make it so as solo I can see the perks he has 
---
For the RPDR fans lurking here, some soundtrack for this amazing footage: [https://youtu.be/p\_oNQcZxozI?t=44](https://youtu.be/p_oNQcZxozI?t=44)
---
(Even for those who are not fans I think the music really fits here)
---
You all got out, you did ok.
---
Haha eat it, toxic comms-using scum /s
---
Urban evasion which you get from nea makes hiding really easy, but if you wanna git gud you should watch some videos of good players and learn to loop efficiently
---
Now they'll DC just because.
---
If you're looking for tips, you could've stayed crouched around the boat instead of running, that definitely let the killer know you were there.
---
 
---
The killer though... I'm almost convinced she let you and Bill escape on purpose
---
This. Legions bring Bloodhound + Sloppy Butcher, turn around, and follow your blood.
---
Fair enough.  I panicked because Rancor revealed my location to her so I thought she knew I was there anyway.  Fair enough.
---
Well quite simply you lied, that’s why the downvotes matter but whatever.
---
It doesn’t have the best survival rate? First of all we’ve never seen stats on this and secondly, you said yourself, bad survivors don’t necessarily do good with DS which would quite obviously mess with stats. 
---
Anyone can prove it, go and run every perk in the game 1 at a time against a decent killer and tell me which one gives you the best results. Assuming your a decent survivor you’ll come to the same conclusion that dozens of streamers and thousands of players have.
---
If you look at the, “stats,” you’ve shown you’ll notice some rather odd. The perks with the highest survival rate are perks used most commonly by new/bad players meaning the numbers are likely boosted by players going against other new players making your entire point moot. Good try though.
---
I have proven you wrong, on a couple of occasions now. I’m unsure what more I can say to show you that if you haven’t noticed yourself by now. Anyways I’m done with the convo, just wasting time at this rate. 
---
Its the safest pallet in many maps, that means if its dropped, it cant be outplayed. You have to destroy it if you want to get a survivor that is playing around it. It is also a pallet that you can always get a lot of distance with. Lastly, you can easily save, or threaten a save if someone is being taken to the basement. Try to save it for late-game, if possible. The guaranteed distance, or a save is worth a lot more if the exit gates are powered.
---
Atleast dying to a trap is more entertaining than just falling down. But honestly I don't see any Pigs moonwalking, or any posts about Pigs moonwalking. At least not anymore.
---
Before today we could do both, relay information with each other mid-match, *and* after we've been removed from it. Both are beneficial to the team. As of today they can only do the former. Of course it's better to pass information along in a match while you're still participating in it.
---
I’ve talked to multiple people who think that legion is OP. The confusion between OP and frustrating to play against happens a lot more than you think 
---
Yes, it literally helps with all perks. I've been in 4 man SWF groups that have had someone die first intentionally to let everyone know what perks were being run by the killer. Yes, if you have hundreds of hours into the game you can suspect what perks are being run by the killer's game play, but no everyone is as good as others. If someone dies and the killer is running two end game perks, they can be rendered null by people ACTUALLY doing dull totems. (I say that because people hardly ever do all the dull totems before endgame.
---
It's a HUGE nerf to SWF groups, IMO.
---
Who else would it be, exactly?
---
No idea, I play on PS4 too and literally have only come across this twice 
---
BAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA these kids even in this thread "respect me, make sure im having fun and let me win sometimes if you wipe the floor with me" BAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Same kids who had parents get the older brother in trouble for beating them too much in games BAAAAHAHAHAHA
---
How do you counter nurse. By juking and stealth right, do that with legion and stop crying
---
I remember back when a killer did this for me, he was so nice, he got his and i got mine.... 
---
Was playing Nea actually 
---
No problem! Hex totems are an interest aspect, after all.
---
Literally me last night on my first Freddy run.
---
A few guys I talked to I know personally and they’re all rank 5-1. I guess they think that JSU because Legion has no counterplay that they’re OP. 
---
Why does it say “Match Consequences”
---
Which makes the inability to pass along info later pointless if it's the same info as what you already passed along....
---
If you're really that new you'll learn just as much by watching the other survivors playing after you're dead as you will seeing the names of perks you don't know. Watch what they do, see their techniques.
---
&gt;Great work taking my words out of context, as you decided to ignore the portion saying how casual teams often include lots of unnecessary sound and talk.
---
Great work not actually reading my reply. If you had you'd know I mentioned that:
---
&gt;doesn't matter how casual , it's still an extra unfair advantage.
---
Amazing what a little reading can reveal, no?
---
&gt;it’s definitely possible to win without chat, but the chat helps,
---
**Of course** it helps, that's what an *advantage* does.
---
Did this fix borrowed time in this patch?
---
Oh it's okay then! I just saw your other post, your style is really awesome! Keep it up and don't hesitate to post more If you keep drawing DbD! &lt;3
---
Guess he should learn to spread out the gens more lol. It’s like the morons who don’t do totems then cry about noed. 
---
Yeah, and they said they were working on trying to separate solo and SWF players so this isn’t an issue. The biggest issue is that most players probably won’t care. Once survivors hit rank, oh, 12 or so, they pretty much know by then. I agree it could be problematic for newer players, but the amount of ANY amount of killers helped seems higher than new players harmed. I may be some killer main, but I honestly think that’s a fair enough trade.
---
I'm 40% internet.
---
You have to wait until the match is over to see it now.
---
Play while you can who know for how long game will be functional.
---
You are right, my bad memory messaged me up. Thank you!!!
---
that's ok, SWFs are getting a buff with the new Matchmaking system making it harder to dodge them. 
---
What's that noise, Doc? 
---
I do play both and I see equally many killers dc if they get looped like they are shit (usually they are because killers pip too easy)
---
If you believe it is random, then it had about a 2.7% chance of appearing each week until the Clown. Spirit brought it to 2.5%; Legion leaving us with a cool 2.3%.
---
Odds of getting any perk are totally garbage, with that in mind.
---
I suck at reading Myers' hand. I always assume closed is open. That's why I hopped into a locker against a Myers with JM Memorial + Judith's Journal. (He brought a black ward too)
---
When I'm playing with friends I remind them to crouch after I unhook them. They crouch for 2 seconds and then start running and set off traps. 
---
Oh wow, I always thought it was gens left. Thanks for clearing that up! If thats the case, then what happened to OP is definitely odd.
---
It's sarcasm ;)
---
Watching rank 18-20 survivors won't teach new people anything.
---
Under miscellaneous it says "Fixed an issue with generator repair efficiency for multiple Survivors working on the same generator. The efficiency debuff (-10%) should now be applied at the correct rate.:
---
Best I know is you can get to around level 35 with 1 million bp
---
They should just give killers more perks when they are SWF.
---
After all, SFW is having more perks and nullifying some.
---
He’s only op with the frank’s mixtape and cold dirt.
---
You didn’t even watch it and considering there is a “gameplay” flair...why did you comment? 
---
Unlike what people are saying it does still exist but it isn't really bad. A lot of people use it as an excuse but good survivors can do all gens in like 5 minutes or less even if the killer is decent 
---
This happened to a survivor in my last game as well. They flamed me for it :(
---
That's not what that means at all. I said those things to show how weak ds is, it's not very effective unless the gates are opened, thus the things I said have to be a thing for it to be the stronger perk, otherwise it's just an annoyance while noed can score you a 4 man in certain situations
---
No,it's just an asshole thing to do.
---
Yeah but like, NOED is useless for that survivor if you have no mither 
---
I feel I should mention something on this.
---
In all honesty it's not a big change at all. More often then not you can deduce what 4 perks the killer has, you can tell add-ons pretty easily most of the time based off what's happening and the offering you can either see when starting up the match OR you can safely assume it's a mori.
---
It is a change that honestly should've happened a long time ago either way.
---
nah man, the aura reading is the cherry on top. I and probably most people would use it just for points 
---
Lol. I am trying on imaging that.
---
But on a surface like a couch, the triggers will be pushed eventually because they're very sensitive.
---
Common incident. Happens often to people when they watch a dvd (trigger = skip forwards/backwards)
---
Damn that's going to suck. 
---
Dedicated servers are never happening
---
So true... 
---
this event sounds fucking awful and i wish they would go back to the howling grounds/summer bbq style events where it DOESNT affect gameplay
---
I’m kinda mad your using a sabo toolbox with repair addons tbh lol
---
They can, but they won't because BHVR needs to go trough a lot of trouble to allow this and it will also cost a certain price
---
You shut your whore mouth!
---
I don' t wang Dwightie-Boy crying again so watch your language.
---
Yeah I think as annoying as things like noed are and other perks like nurses and bbq are it's not fair killers get their perks revealed and survivors don't the update was a good addition 
---
I had a game recently (rank 7-6ish, ps4) where the entire team just ran towards hex totems and hooked people all game, and eventually got devour hope’d to death. And like. Do people not know crouching exists?
---
That game gave me a migraine.
---
They’re coming this summer, they announced it on game awards.
---
There's a difference between OP and oppressive. Legion's oppressive because there's basically nothing a survivor can do to escape them. Legion's also low tier because even then, it still takes forever to down a survivor. 
---
Basically, because of Legion's poorly thought-out mechanics, any buff to make them decent is gonna take them straight from bad to OP.
---
Not winning chases isn’t the problem that part didn’t make any sense
---
TrueTalent had this happen on stream when he played PTB 2.5. Sometimes hugging the left wall all the way out worked for him.
---
This is what should've happened! Gia and Naomi KillTd it
---
What is noed? 
---
&gt;Of course having an In game chat would ruin the experience, imagine all the screaming and yelling that would happen in random games.
---
Nice mental gymnastics. You know that's not what they mean, fuck off with the BS.
---
&gt;I will be happy to say that I was wrong but there isn't sufficient evidence to that
---
There is. I linked it. You stuck your head in your ass and pretended it said something else. There's plenty of other instances over the years, but I'm not your secretary. I'm not going to hunt for them just for you to continue ignoring them.
---
just a small correction, whenever you are repairing with teammates, everybody has 90%.  so when there are 3 survivors, the total repair speed is 270%, and 360% with 4 survivors.
---
self care?
---
*"Darn. I missed that skillcheck. Sorry guys, I'm new at this."*
---
Damn you’re a badass bro. Will you sign my mousepad?
---
What’s open handed?
---
removed for name shaming 
---
I disagree because I think new players SHOULD stick around and watch the other people play. That's how they learn strategy and techniques, not by saying "oh, he was running noed" and immediately disconnecting.
---
Watching the rest of my team play is sometimes my favorite part (mostly solo here), but I played a lot of F13 early on so I got used to doing that with these kind of games.
---
Survive With Friends could exploit an attitude like that.
---
Someone can legit run you around for half the match, get downed, ds, and then run you again for the rest of the match. It’s such a nuisance. You essentially get rewarded for doing bad ( i know noed is the same, but you can cancel noed by the totems, that perk is solely based on if survivors wanna do em or not, while ds is based on if they can hit the skillcheck, which in my opinion is too big for the reward of being able to get a second chance ) Basically their both, very toxic, just depends on if you play survivor or killer more. I personally play survivor a bit more and even i know ds is such an op perk. It has no business being in this game. But thats just me, im not bias. 
---
It removes the biggest optional objective in the game and replaces it with another mandatory one.
---
Now that's pretty spicy.
---
No. You have to wait until the match is over to see the killer's perks. This is a clitch lmao. 
---
Run an exhaustion perk with Adrenaline, it just works.
---
wait so there is a glitch that as a survivor you get stuck in the basement? 
---
Yes. You learn a lot watching other people play. I think this is a good thing for new solo players, honestly.
---
You can tell this to me when they fuck something up and don't take 2 months to fix.
---
eh. I play pig with bloodwarden/noed against SWF if I can spot one. It's funny because everyone thinks pigs run noed (not wrong in this case) and everyone is looking for dull totems, then 1st one dies, they see bloodwarden and they 99% the gates instead of opening them but the friend is slugged instead of hooked, they go pick him up... but wait! there's a trap on his head and the pig is right behind him. 
---
man, those games were fun, even with bloodwarden never activating and dull totems cleansed before noed, it was basically playing around them playing around my perks. (the remaining 2 perks are bbq and brutal strenght, because love me some points and also fuck pallets, the build focused on making the map clean for the endgame more than getting hooks when gens are up) 
---
If you're unhappy with the game and how the developers run their business then stop playing
---
Haha lol, well glad to see I'm not the only one.
---
I was playing against The Legion.
---
I guess that’s why they all slowly walk backwards while “chasing” you then. Gotta get their vision ba....oh survivor fell down how lucky. 😂
---
Mama Huntress is best girl absoluetely
---
Yeah. One person could die, see your load out, and notify the entire team. It literally made things like blood warden and NOED completely useless
---
What is the benefit of that? If I'm switching to a new character I want to look at the perks/offering so I'm going to the character menu anyway. I've already used an unwanted killer by accidentally hitting R2 right before the match.
---
Nah fuck legion lmao 
---
This is my thanks. 
---
I got it for free when it came out for PS Plus. You don't gotta be a dick to the console community.
---
Sadly, they're allowed to use the hatch. With the power of imagination, you can at least picture them realising somewhere in the distance that they're still wearing the damn thing. Maybe it pops. Maybe they show up to the next match with it still on their head.
---
You can see them after the game is done. Be patient, little kid.
---
prove thyself makes the bar red to show there's a 10% repair debuff (:
---
Noed check baby
---
JUST BREAK THE PALLET!!!
---
(so painful to watch, I hope that Doc gets a warm cup of Cocoa)
---
Hi. Thanks for the comment. You’re a piece of shit who just likes to be an asshole to anyone who comments or posts. It’s no wonder half of your comments are negative karma. Maybe take that as a hint to grow as a person and stop being a child? Or you probably are. Your shitty, low quality memes come off as though they were made by a junior in high school who doesn’t socialize much. 
---
I didn’t know people would take this seriously lol
---
oh ok, thanks!
---
I hope you reported them/their channel, chances are it's not the first time they've said that shit.
---
I guess so.
---
There is no guarentee that hitting the ds skill check means you'll get to lead the killer around again. There are places where if someone uses ds, you can trap them in a corner till the stun gets wasted and immediately down them again, meaning they wasted a perk slot. Dribbling also exist, and if someone is leading you around the whole match go for another survivor or its the killers fault for wasting so much time on the obsession. It really isnt an op perk, it's an overrated one. While noed can score you a free kill or multiple free kills, unless all totems were cleansed which requires totem hunting and cleansing which can take a lot of time depending on the map. You can base entire builds around noed and have success because the instadown.
---
? There was no sign of sarcasm what’re you talking about lol. But I’m glad you’re joking because it’s definitely one of the...not smartest things I’ve ever seen. 
---
Holy shit,this happened to my friend while i was in a lobby with him in voice chat,i was not trying to laugh so hard in the background lmao
---
The engineer’s toolbox is the only toolbox that doesn’t say that it unlocks sabo or affects sabo speed. Can it still be used for sabotage? I feel like the answer just has to be yes but the inconsistent labels bug me.
---
God, the Pregnant part made me laugh. Good one.
---
Did they happen to fix the "glitch" i guess where if you down someone and pick them up as Legion while frenzy is still charging it will deplete the bar to zero and start charging again as soon as someone is picked up? Didnt really see anything in the patch notes for that
---
That's silly. If the survivors want to deal with no ed they shouldn't be punished for not doing totems. Sometime you just wanna get the gens done and get out. The incentive for cleansing totems is the 600/1000 BP and to get rid of noed. They shouldn't be forced to do it
---
TBF the year of the Pig was when John Kramer planned for his wife to have a kid, and there's some other symbolic stuff involved, and he used a year of the pig mask to abduct his first victim, and then Amanda was wearing the same mask that he'd been wearing... so I mean, she kinda already has a year of the pig mask, in a way.
---
I have indeed. And this idiot Meg kept trying to unhook me and got repeatedly grabbed off.
---
This sounds just like the old hook lag about a year ago
---
I may hate him but this is cool as finally getting a legion buff
---
I was excited for opening an exit gate at 90% speed myself
---
i played my bloodweb as conservatively as possible to see if i could make it to 50 (avoiding purple and pink stuff) and made it to 46
---
Where did he say you get 20k bp plus new bp? I didn’t see that

what was broken on it?

[Here's the picture](https://imgur.com/jvYdlet.jpg). Found it on the Zedge app. It also has some dbd related ringtones, including a quite fucked remix of bing bong and Billy's chainsaw, lol
---
I don't see how this changes anything or why everyone is so excited about it. The perks and add-ons have effects throughout the game that are displayed to you as soon as you're effected by it and anyone who has any decent amount of time on this game and are really familiar with both sides will know exactly what perks the killer has during the first chase of the match. 
---
As someone here already said, this really only effects the users of noed. 
---
My opinion is no as well. Same reasons as listed above. Uncloaking is pretty slow as is
---
I was already quite intrigued by the story, and when I heard Ace got the hatch I liked it even more.
---
Read the first bullet and the last sentence of the last paragraph again. 
---
Localization strings in a file, probably a bad copy paste.

That moment when this is actually me not saving my friend on the hook,he was literally ''REEEEEEEE'ing'' after the lobby and laughed so much about it XD
---
I laughed so hard at the gun one 
---
For the umpteen billionth time, *they can't.* Not under the current p2p structure. You'll have to wait for the dedicated servers to go live.
---
I had a a full team running around teabagging me the other day. I somehow managed to kill 3 of them, while the last guy alive (who also happened to be the guy teabagging the most) was sitting at an exit gate. I went into stealth mode, and waited by the exit gate for him to come out. With how much this guy was teabagging me during the game, I just knew that he wouldn’t be able to leave without teabagging me one last time at the exit gate. After about a minute of waiting, he comes creeping out the exit gate to see where I’m at, and I instantly downed him with No One Escapes Death. Brought him to a hook and proceeded to teabag him as he was sacrificed. I only got this game a few days ago, but I don’t think I’ll ever have a more memorable match than that game lol. 
---
Is the crouch movement speed faster?
---
What’s the best perks for my build for my Michael Myers? I’m not looking to do Burger King Myers just a good build. I have Huntress, Spirit, Clown, Myers obviously, and Cannibal. The perks I’m thinking is Monitor and Abuse, Hex: Ruin, Bamboozle, and Spirit fury. But I’m also thinking to use barbecue and chili but I don’t know what to change. I’m on console btw, but which perks should I sure to ensure the best possible build for Myers?
---
airpod memes are so fucking weird
---
Even then he has to stab you 3 times to down you. Cold dirt is good but it doesn’t make him OP. Mid tier at best 
---
That's a good idea, I hope I gets implemented soon.
---
*laughs in rancor*
---
They’re 2 separate things so no he’s not suggesting you  get 20k plus new bp
---
well it makes sense to take shit like that with precaution your role is to kill and could be trying to jebait them into getting more kills

Before the patch it was extremely good on lerys. Dont wanna imagine how it's now. :)
---
Are there even crows there? I can't remember
---
Weird because I just saw 3 people run out of the basement in my game with no issues 
---
You’re an embarrassment 
---
You can always research online if a scenario is plausible. Or ask a friend.
---
How else are Survs supposed to derank?
---
More seriously, we really should increase penalties on that shit. Having bad players stuck playing with players that can wreck their shit to Sunday is not a good thing.
---
I understand it fine you’re either combining the two ideas or just making numbers up 
---
Exactly so why try? Lol. No worries I would’ve never said anything if I knew it was sarcasm
---
I’m not sure how long it actually has to be but yes it is bannable but maybe not for 30 seconds. 
---
But what about people who do use BW? Your argument is moot.
---
Someone might be saving their Spirit Fury, so that argument is also moot.
---
Not everybody refuses to hook RM obsessions, lol, what kind of argument is that?
---
People can confuse DH for Haunted Grounds if it's paired with other hex perks, I've seen people make builds around that fact on Spirit.
---
You don't know if it's an Ebony or Ivory mori, or even a Cypress. "Blatantly obvious" my ass.
---
Shhhhh
---
Nah.
---
I could not get behind the whole not getting the thing off in the first chest thing. It should be random like it is. I think they did good by spreading out the chest things
---
Where you reading the same thing I was? They mention "in game chat", which is a chat in the game(for your claims of "mental gymnastics"), that is what a feature of that nature would entail if implemented. What you linked does not prove the point you are trying to prove. I'm not your persuasive writing teacher, but if I was I would tell  you to use better sources to pursue your point, and in a peaceful debate/discussion (which I have been trying to have) don't use words, and or phrases that dumb down your claim, such as "fuck off",  "bs", and referring to someone as a headass, really doesn't paint a good picture of yourself.
---
What if it was proximity based?
---
I would say for half of the killers it is a viable off meta and other half not worth running. Killers that benefit from zoning that dont already rely on aura reading heavily are good with Spies. Needs a bit of time to test to really know for sure and probably dependant on your add on build too. 
---
Survivors have plenty of bullshit themselves. They can use insta heal med kits and repair a generator in 10 second off of spawn with the right offerings and ad ons. 
---
Y'all killers shouldn't back out now lol
---
Who said it was balanced?
---
I can understand ivory’s but ebony moris are complete bull. 
---
I don’t know why more people aren’t complaining about this as it’s clearly worse than DS, NOED, -and pretty well everything else.
---
Also, nice rude post and then insta-delete. You're the embarrassed one.
---
Agreed\^. Especially because when you uncloack you'll get a temporary speed boost to ensure you can smack em
---
more often than*
---
Someone about to be hooked? Legit no reason not to take the 4 seconds to play around with BBQ, or at least attempt a mind game
---
That.... Could actually work. Bunny Feng Easter cosmetic confirmed? 😂
---
My dad 
---
I did down them and hook so i wasnt holding game hostage
---
No, there are literally 0 crows on that map.  Hence the crying.
---
I hate it. I’m not playing SWF and if I’m the obsession I want to see what my camper an tunnel death was worth. Without having to spectate the whole match. 
---
Shit lol
---
Oooooh very nice!
---
Yeah, it counters a lot of hex perks and it is very very rarely seen. That’s why I pointed it out ;)
---
Great way for you and your SWF to get mori'd
---
Nope, but they still get called a camper anyway 
---
Yea I’m working on being nicer to people like you on the Internet. It’s quite difficult 
---
Hey, that's awesome. It's my bad then for assuming the worst of this community, I would've assumed the survivor was salty at least - but it honestly seems like a miracle both of you came away amicably from this. I guess spending that much time staring into each others' eyes ends up becoming a bonding experience :)
---
whats wrong with using ds?
---
If you’re so salty............... *get urban evasion.*
---
Maybe you need more practice. 
---
It was a buff. You'd have to be an absolute moron to argue against that. 
---
Summon the bunny chapter
---
I would be facecamping you til you died if you did that to me lmao 
---
Get 4 man escapes and it won't matter
---
As far as I can remember they said in the dev stream that luck now affects rarities, haven't tested it out just yet though.
---
I'm feeling my dr and dbd oats.
---
\*last year the nightmare intensifies\* 
---
Exactly. It's a lose/lose situation for handling this issue of memorizing spawns.
---
*tusken raider noise intensifies*
---
In this realm we stan miss Gia
---
How is trying not to get hit toxic? Dodging a hit is toxic now? Whats wrong with you
---
It's because of the 10% debuff you recieve when multiple people are on the same gen.
---
The devs said Prove Thyself wouldn't *quite* cancel this out.
---
Tier 1 Self Care shows 45% efficiency. Probably just a tooltip bug...
---
Completely balanced. 
---
Wow, that is so weird! The description even implies you can sabo with it. I mean, I know you really don’t want to, it’s just odd.
---
Said the person that whoooshed the joke.
---
Darn now we have to guess which combo of meta perks they are running this time. ruin, noed, nurses, sloppy butcher, bbq, and +1 random perk depending on the killers preference.
---
Insert generic 'wE'Ve DoNe A pReTtY gOoD jOb So FaR" joke
---
Pretty sure it was 10%/15%/20%
---
Get fucked toxic squads.
---
It is a vicious cycle that I see repeating often. Even this random small streamer I checked out last night got bullied by a SWF on a mid tier killer, so he went on this rant about how "if you guys want to play dirty I can too" and put on his omegablink nurse with an Ebony mori even though he was facing a completely different team.
---
Still though, I don't think *every* player you run into is overtly toxic. You probably are just forgetting the ones who stay quiet or just say gg and leave. The vocal minority complaining is always the loudest. Lots of people are too mature to buy into this very teenage toxic dynamic. Maybe it's because whenever I play killer I play very fair and almost never camp even with the gates open because I have a low attention span. But I can't remember the last salty comment I got besides "fk camper jajaja" despite the lack of camping even though I let that same guy go multiple times when I noticed he was AFK.
---
Honestly, the toxicity of the community used to piss me off too. But now I just kind of pity people who get angry over the game, maybe give them a small chuckle if the salt is unique or noteworthy. Maybe I'm getting too old to even relate to it at all or my skin has fully thickened. Either way, it's a much more healthy way to deal with emotionally volatile people; why let their instability affect you when you can just laugh it off and move on? Play your game and enjoy your life, no need to worry about theirs.
---
Did you see the post of the killer of your match
---
Ignore the downvotes brother, fight against those who kill the spirit of the game.
---
No, he’s doing that with intent of downing them. If you trap them and stare at them for any period without preparing to down them your pretty well holding their game hostage. 
---
What happened in the patch?
---
Calm down. It is literally 0.1 of a second.
---
That isn't enough and it's a dumb ass idea from someone who doesn't play killer. 
---
Yea I’d try that then open a ticket if it doesn’t work
---
So the killer should let you escape cause both of you had the game ruined? Just end the game quickly so you can go to another one.
---
That's exactly who I main when farming. Also, I like to play Jingle Bells as a way of making peace, It doesn't work most of the time.

"Ha, you got hooked on me, you fucking suck"
---
Nope i got right in (im rank 9 though) 
---
Who do you start with? I got huntress and nurse plus three og but survivors I got like 4 plus the base three. Is there rhyme or reason to which you start with 
---
He didn't even stop to give you a chance lmao
---
This bug was actually shown on Truetalents stream and YouTube.
---
My dumbass got excited because I found her hex, then immediately RAN to it and get downed by her after she teleported to said hex.
---
... and then there's The Legion
---
It’s the killers only op offering* 
---
Survivors don’t have an op offering. 
---
And the ebony isn’t simply op, it’s completely gamebreaking. If you run an ebony and don’t at least 3k you ducked up hard...
---
Im on Xbox and it’s been happening to me pretty often. Could be up to 5 minutes as a survivor. When I play as killer it loads immediately 
---
It was human though. Just a few more than what it do regularly.
---
Wow I sure hope killers will get to keep their addons one day after they 4k! Oh wait... That's never going to happen.
---
Love how they keeo giving survivors their freebies. Survivors literally get to keep their shit if they escape and now they can find even more in boxes while killers get to spin the wheel of fortune in the bloodweb... 
---
It does, not that it matters much. He will still gain ground quickly. You either need to vault or enter a locker when he is in kill range or you can try to circle a tight loop like large boulders, it messes with the kill button. Otherwise you are dead. The kill range is enough that he can pull you while you are about to throw down a pallet.
---
Lol I’m not saying it isn’t game breaking. I’m just saying there are op things on both sides. Obviously facing a mori can be bullshit.

What killer is that?
---
Yes very annoying! I think one out of six matches, mostly later in the evening. Do people use LEGO technics to build a controller trigger machine or something? Most of those killers have a red ping as well.. Just report the user post game, best you can do.
---
Exactly! I feel like it’s a way to farm/derank, but it’s incredibly annoying to the survivors who wait forever to find games
---
I've had someone do that when I had Devour Hope. I'll have you know their kidneys were delicious.
---
Holy shit that's allot of stuff 
---
Yea, but I wanna use the keyboard buttons or better the wasd buttons
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Exactly! I feel like it’s a way for them to farm/derank, but I’m not sure. It’s incredibly annoying for survivors who wait forever to get in matches

---
Googled how to do it and it worked! Thank you!
---
no this guy has a point and the others are being quite ignorant. Rank 20 survivors not knowing what perks the killers run is BAD. imagine being solo casual and after 30+ hours you hear about this BBQ&amp;Chili perk. Even if they played killer, unless they specifically looked through each killer and knew why it was good, they'd miss it completely.
---
Before I even went to the DBD discord, the post match was such critical information for me to understand WTF was going on, every match I'd look at a perk think it's strong, nope it's weak. I'd see every killer running NOED/Ruin wonder why, boom it's top tier.
---
np happy to have helped 
---
Ummmm what? Realistically I think gens r tine. Deranking players is the real problem. If everyone played at there skill level, then the game would become balanced threw survival of the fittest. Let Darwin balance the game lol 
---
Its too risky. Survivors would act like cry babies and leave negative reviews again.
---
Huntress.
---
I'm on Xbox too. We have more willpower to survive than those PC scrubs.
---
huntress
---
10 minutes
---
Vault momentum in a buff and the only significant one in there. Both of the Dwight perks are still so bad they won't be used. I also won't count bug fixes because those are usually short term by nature.
---
In total, survivors got one (1) significant buff. Care to count all the ones that killers got?
---
Hmm, not sure why your opinion is the right one and the opinion of many other people is wrong.
---
Random survivor select. 
---
From what I remember, they stack in a weird way in that running both of them makes your terror radius 6 meters in tier 2, which is about the same as the red stain length.
---
we need Ru implemented into the game
---
The fck is a Cloun?
---
Lmao punish yourself by getting no bloodpoints. That'll show those Gen rushers. 
---
Hail, Mandy, full of craze!
---
Hey guys, so with the new buff of Prove Thyself included in patch 2.5.0, me and some friends tried to do the fastest generator possible. With all 4 survivors running prove thyself, resilience, spine chill and max stacks stakeout, as well as engineers toolboxes with 2 yellow add-ons for speed and efficiency (didn't wanna run BNP for reasons) we managed to get a final time of 13.6 seconds. We tried this a few times, this was the best speed we got. There is probably room for slight improvement somewhere, but this is the best we could get. Be sure to try this on your own, and let me know if there are any other ways we could get this faster, not including a BNP. IMO this strat would never actually be useful in game, we rather just wanted to see what surviviors were capable of with the new Prove Thyself. Thanks!!
---
...you've got to be kidding haha 
---
I did this too where I was like time to plunder! I got a two purples and a green!
---
It would be cool if getting 4 kills would give you a random Rare to Ultra Rare add-on.
---
it's a soggy gross one but also yes
---
Whilst we are at it we should also make survivors die on first hook and ruin should no longer be a hex and is also base kit for all killers. Only THEN is it fair.
---
I like to track breathing more than anything and that’s why I love Stridor. 
---
If you hate stealth play, just Play Doctor or Legion and sloppy Butcher and Bloodhound/Predator. 
---
Hiding is kinda luck and clothing skill. Just pick colors that are naturally in the greens and browns and sometimes dark blues too. Map depending, you can hide really well. Or just use Quick and Quiet, Lightweight, Lithe And Dance With Me. Just be a full ninja. 
---
Lol they get points 
---
I think that's because messaging someone to trick them takes the game to a level that's way too personal.
---
You’ve spent that much time on this game and still DC just because the opposition is doing their objective? Unreal 
---
What else am I supposed to do? All survivors can do is generators.
---
I would love that, it'd make for so many shit my pants moments in SWF
---
Just a little bit
---
Nope. But you have a pretty small radius anyway so you’re fine. 
---
You're either lucky or I'm very unlucky. I feel like I run into it multiple times a night. 
---
From what i've played, its okay. Surveillance is SO much better now though. Tried it on a prayer beads spirit and had five grabs in a single game.
---
This made my day lmao. By this logic, if you down me too fast, I'm going to DC so you don't get any points. This has to be a joke. 
---
What killer did you verse? The wraith bug dropped frames if it was bag 
---
Imagine opening the exit after all that and you run out the gate only to run into the basement again
---
Like bbq, devour hope, and less emblem points? Hmmm, novel idea. 
---
Why not Brand New Parts?
---
Btw, this post will probably be deleted. i posted a screenshot like this once and it happened to me :/
---
I have to say this is the coalest drawing of Rin I have seen.
---
I think this is really bad bait and I can't believe 11 people seriously answered you 
---
No buff is needed, The perk is perfect. Also works as intended 
---
Being trained for something, like catching people in a bear trap, doesn't change the fact that in the end, he's still human to a degree. Human error. 
---
It should be a deterrent even for the trapper himself. If you go hunting for a bear and you set traps for it, but are careless enough to put your foot where you put the trap, is it stupid that it will close on and break your ankle? No, it isn't stupid. It's you who are stupid in that situation. 
---
The killers are already overpowered as it is, by design, cause none of the survivors apparently know how to ball up a fist, or pick up a stick to defend themselves. Being able to just walk over your own trap as if you don't weigh anything would tip the scale too far over in their favor.
---
Who won?
---
I think it rewards in-match. Just had a match against a Freddy who chased me forever without hitting me and I only co-op finished 1,5 gens and still maxed out my objective with 8k points.
---
Lol he’s from USA and doesn’t have a clue how far a meter is. 
---
Couldn't agree more, arguably quite OP
---
That's not a rape, I'm happy this exist.
---
I think you're right, however, the 100% bonus blood points does sound like a good buff to the current perk.
---
so your not good at the game?
---
This made me laugh way the hell too much. 
---
They did mention something about something being located at the top of the stairs instead of the center of the basement, related to hook spawning. That may have caused this bug.
---
this reminds me of when i played a match after the update and the game was going semi well, then suddenly out of nowhere the game just ended and it said i was a ruthless killer, even though i didn't kill anyone and nobody escaped.
---
So basically let me win or im not playing get over yourself

Bro it's 3 items...
---
Saw a 10 second finish with 4 BNPs the other day on YouTube. Not sure about the perks they used though
---
Or when you do a Mori and you don't even get to see the damage you inflicted. Sorry, if the spirit is gonna hack my body apart with a broken katana, I wanna see limbs go flying.
---
...Well some survivors DC for "kill rushing"..
---
its a troll this user also made a post a few mins ago saying gens should take 5 mins to finish 
---
As a David King main i stand with you. David needs no help.
---
You should try someone good like nurse
---
According to the video I just saw, people just quickswitch between their survivors
---
People can be so dumb and needy lol not you, I know that's sarcasm
---
I thought it was working for me
---
Whole context?
---
Sometimes people want to know how the hell the killer found you just to see that he has a perk with him to know that it a) exists b)know if he suspects a killer to have it to be able to play around.
---
Solo players also have to learn their own tricks since they cant 100% trust the teammates since you cant know if they even come to save you.
---
But if you die as first and have to wait 10+ minutes because 1 douche is waiting at the exit while teabagging just to see why you played wrong is just bad.
---
Nope.
---
I just played a match on MacMillan and I noticed the same thing! The brick does look better for some reason
---
It's always the same non DLC/licensed people.
---
Lol ya I'd love to get a msg that says I'm watching u then see a micheal

---
* **Rule 8** - Oversaturated Content. Oversatured posts are common &amp; uninteresting posts that do not add anything of value to the subreddit.
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.
---
That, or they're actually a killer who can't get out of rank 20 and lied about "I have every perk on every killer and survivor". Probably one of those killers who gets looped by a survivor for 5 minutes thwn complains about gen rushing
---
Lungs too
---
I agree that it is a pain for new survivors trying to learn the game, but unfortunately the benefit of hiding the perks vastly outweighs the cost. SWF being able to report the killer's perks is practically match ruining. Having to wait a few minutes for the match to end pales in comparison.
---
that is a fair point as well lol
---
I always check to see if the killer isn't trying to kill me before the chase sequence
---
David too fat to climb windows.
---
I did laugh when it ended at the scream.
---
All I saw was a floating flashlight. Was your character model not rendered in?
---
Just taking forever on PS4 but hey it's ok we will have an event coming soon we can wish we were taking part in lol. 
---
I’m a bit rusty, why are these killers weaker on that map?
---
I had a game where i guess they lagged out at the end and was stuck for a fee minutes. It just went to the end screen with a remaining survivor after a bit. 
---
A lot of folks saying its better to learn by watching other remaining survivors - which, true, is immensely helpful - but I fully agree with you. 
---
I'm new-ish (been playing since it was the free PS4 game), at Rank 7, solo only, and rely on the post-game screen to understand how I should have better-adapted to the killer. Stuff like "Why the heck did I lose my items halfway through??" - Oh, he had Franklins (which I didn't know was a thing). Or "why was that Myers able to insta-mori me?" - Ohhh he brought specific stuff for that. I find looking at the killer's loadout super educational.
---
Friday The 13th does that, and it's one of the things I'd love for DVD to have.
---
THANK YOU, I THOUGHT NO ONE ELSE WAS GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT.
---
I played against a Legion with Franks and Stab Wound Frenzy.. basically if he hits you for the second time, if you lose chase with him for half a second you're downed
---
Going on 20 minutes right now
---
To this day I still see trappers at least 5 times per day cause of their daily ritual for getting survivors in traps who no longer get stuck in bear traps cause they're apparently so easy to see, even in tall grass lol
---
This is like every game on ps4 lol 
---
Thank u next on your shit comment
---
The problem is, survivors' objective is easier and there's more than one of them. Three survivors can be on separate gens at one time, which is more than half of the survivors' objective. 
---
Meanwhile, the killer can only chase one person at a time, and only has at least one hook guaranteed from this chase. That's only *1/12* (four survivors and three hooks each) of the killer's objective done, and even that can take a while depending on how long the actual chase is, nevermind getting past all the bodyblocking, DS,and flashlights to the hook. 
---
Not to mention that survivors can speed this up even faster. While, yes, killers have stuff to help them with the chase and slow stuff down, again, 1/12 of their objective.
---
First of all, the map is pretty big and has good loops. Second of all, killers can't see anything through the corn.
---
no sorry im laurie's twin who uses a watermark which is literally laurie's discord
---
Or just, you know.
---
Like a random offering or addon of uncommon and up rarities?
---
Alright makes sense, thank you
---
If you can't dribble the DS then slug them. 
---
It still generates more pressure than getting DSd and chasing them again. Now someone has to get off a generator to go pick them up. Just stay in the general proximity of the slug and catch the guy going for the save.
---
look at the name as well. He couldn't make it more obvious if he tried.
---
It does
---
I think the point is that it's a feature that's only going to be used to annoy the killer. We know it's not a glitch. 
---
Idk if it’s swf but the past week gens have been going quick. Surviors don’t have anything else to do unless you have ruin so it kind of is what it is. If you don’t get momentum going quick it just doesn’t end well lol
---
Tough to say, some killers like the top 4 can apply map pressure and that tends to slow it down but for all others. If I’m not running ruin, just have to hope they aren’t going hardcore at the gens. I’ve had some matches where the chases were short each time but after about 3-4 hooks the match is pretty much over. Sometimes it can’t always be helped I’d say.
---
I'm new to the game, that's my excuse lol
---
ah didn‘t think about that .. still funny how the killer &amp; survivor posted that in the same lobby lol
---
can u explain
---
I usually don't use headphones because I multitask a lot so my vision is at 150%. Yesterday I gen grabbed a Feng with Tier 1 M&amp;A Myers while another Feng tried to alert her with gestures and tbag. It was hilarious. The smart Feng didn't even want to unhook her.
---
That's the thing though. I ALWAYS use ruin. And today, literally everyone have been gods at landing skillchecks. I play on console, so thats pretty rare.
---
That's so nice. I thank you on behalf of all the sandbagged survivors out there
